Researchers have revealed that earlier reports of a massive drop in preschoolersâ€™ obesity rates were overstated and based on skewed data.

To many in the field, a study was published in late February in the Journal of the American Medical Association seemed too good to be true- and now they believe it was.

In fact, based on the researchers' own data, the obesity rate may have even risen rather than declined.

No one had a ready explanation for that astounding finding by researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: anti-obesity campaigners credited everything from changes to the federal nutrition program for low-income women and children to the elimination of trans-fats from fast food, more physical activity in child-care programs and declining consumption of sugary drinks.

False start: An earlier study has been re-examined after making major claims about improved health of children ages 2 to 5 years and now it is believed the obesity rate either stayed the same or increased

First Lady Michelle Obama and others seized on the finding as a sign that efforts to combat the national obesity epidemic were paying off.

But as obesity specialists take a closer look at the data, some are questioning the 43 per cent claim, suggesting that it may be a statistical fluke and pointing out that similar studies find no such decrease in obesity among preschoolers.

'You need to have a healthy degree of skepticism about the validity of this finding,' said Dr. Lee Kaplan, director of the weight center at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.

No evidence of the kinds of major shifts in the behavior among preschoolers aged 2 to 5 exists which would explain a 43 per cent drop in their obesity rates, he said.

The latest study is based a well-respected data set taken from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, or NHANES, which has been conducted annually since the 1960s and involves in-person interviews and physical exams.

The CDC defines obesity in adults as having a body mass index - a ratio of weight to height - above 30, but in children it is defined by where the individual falls on age- and sex-specific growth charts.

The 2011-2012 version of the survey included 9,120 people; 871 of them were 2 to 5 years old.

In some research 871 would be considered a large number. But when the obesity rate is fairly low, having a sample of a few hundred makes it easier for errors to creep in through random chance.

'In small samples like this, you are going to have chance fluctuations,' said epidemiologist Geoffrey Kabat of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City.

The CDC scientists were aware of the statistical limitations of their data, and their paper clearly stated that the findings were imprecise.

The 43 per cent headline figure refers to the drop from the 13.9 per cent rate in 2003-04 to the 8.4 per cent rate in 2011-2012.

Questioning the numbers: This graph shows the data from the February report which has now been questioned because this group used too small a sample size

The change of 5.5 points represents a decline of 40 per cent from the original 13.9 per cent. (The 43 per cent trumpeted by a CDC press release comes from rounding those numbers to 14 and 8, respectively.)

The 13.9 per cent obesity rate among preschoolers reported for 2003-2004 had a large enough margin of error that the actual rate could range between 10.8 per cent and 17.6 per cent, the CDC authors acknowledged.

The 8.4 per cent rate in 2011-2012 reported could range from 5.9 per cent and 11.6 per cent.

Since the range for 2003-2004 overlaps with that of 2011-2012, Kabat said, 'that's another way of saying there might have been no change' in preschoolers' obesity rate. Even an increase is a statistical possibility.

Indeed, the CDC scientists' conclusion is that 'there have been no significant changes in obesity prevalence in youth or adults between 2003-2004 and 2011-2012.'

Even so, a CDC press release trumpeted in its first sentence 'a significant decline in obesity among children aged 2 to 5 years,' with obesity prevalence for this group showing 'a decline of 43 per cent.'

No drastic changes for decades: Researchers now believe that the true findings prove there has not been a dramatic drop in recent years

In addition, claiming a 43 per cent plunge in preschooler obesity 'isn't really properly descriptive of the trend,' because the rates have bounced around over the last decade, the spokeswoman, Corey Slavitt, said.

A study of preschoolers in the federal WIC (Women, Infants and Children) program, which provides food vouchers, nutrition classes and counseling to low-income families, found virtually no change in obesity rates.

Rather than reducing the prevalence of obesity among 3-and-4-year olds in the WIC program in California's Los Angeles County, researchers found that the problem worsened from 2003 to 2011.

Obesity rose to 20.4 per cent from about 17 per cent, the researchers reported in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in 2013.

In New York, the WIC study found that obesity rates fell to 15.5 per cent in 2011 from about 19.5 per cent in 2003, a much less dramatic drop than the 40 per cent decline.

'We agree there is a slight downward trend in obesity among 2-to-5-year olds,' said Shannon Whaley, a co-author of the WIC study.

But a 43 per cent drop is absolutely not what we're seeing.'

The WIC study included more than 200,000 children, while the CDC researchers 'looked at just a small population of 2-to-5-year olds,' said Whaley, who serves as director of research and evaluation at the Public Health Enterprises Foundation.

For obesity rates to drop, researchers reckon, young children have to eat differently and become more active. But research shows little sign of such changes among 2-to-5-year olds, casting more doubt on the 43 per cent claim.

Such a decline would require changes in exercise, food consumption and sleep patterns, said Mass General's Kaplan 'There is no evidence of that,' he said.

In 2010 Whaley and her colleagues examined the effectiveness of WIC classes and counseling to encourage healthy eating and activities for women and children in the program.

Their findings were discouraging: Television watching and consumption of sweet or salty snacks actually rose, while fruit and vegetable consumption fell - changes that could lead to weight gain. One positive was a rise in physical activity.
