Former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez was seen 'messing with' the security camera in his basement the day after the Odin Lloyd was killed one of his maids testified in court on Tuesday.

He also exchanged text messages with the man he is charged with murdering in the hours before the killing took place according to cell phone records shown in court on Tuesday.

Raymond MacDonald, a T-Mobile employee, testified that the messages from Hernandez were on the cell phone of  Lloyd, whose bullet-ridden body was found in an industrial park near Hernandez's home in North Attleborough, Massachusetts, on June 17, 2013.

The texts appear to have been deleted from Hernandez's phone some time after they were sent to Lloyd.

Meanwhile, Glaucia Santos said Tuesday that she was cleaning a bathroom when she heard Hernandez enter, at which point she saw him touching the camera, which is located on the basement's family room ceiling. 

Bristol County Assistant District Attorney Patrick Bomberg showed Lloyd's phone in Massachusetts Superior Court in Fall River, Massachusetts, and asked MacDonald to read text messages sent from a number identified as Hernandez's.

On the night of June 16, Hernandez texted Lloyd; 'imma hit u when i'm dat way like Las time.'

After midnight on June 17, Loyd texted back: 'We still on.' 

A few hours later, prosecutors say, Hernandez and two friends, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, picked up Lloyd at his Boston home and drove him to the industrial park where he was later shot dead.

The records also showed calls to Lloyd's phone from Wallace's number, and do not show any further calls or texts from Lloyd's phone after 3:23am on June 17.

Hernandez, 25, had a $41 million contract with the New England Patriots when he was arrested for Lloyd's murder in June 2013, but was dropped him from the team hours after his arrest.

Wallace and Ortiz will be tried separately. 

All three men have pleaded not guilty.

During the testimony, Hernandez leaned over to speak with his attorney at one point

Lloyd, 27, was a semi-professional football player who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. The sister testified earlier that the men were in the early stages of a friendship and smoked marijuana together, but were not close.

Defense attorneys have argued Hernandez and Lloyd were good friends, and that Hernandez would never have shot him.

Defense attorneys, meanwhile, filed a motion to prevent jurors from hearing about a civil suit filed by a former friend of Hernandez, Alexander Bradley, who claimed Hernandez shot him in the face after an argument in Florida in 2013.

Prosecutors want Associate Justice Susan Garsh to allow the jury to hear about that case, arguing it refutes the defense team's assertion Hernandez would not shoot a friend.
