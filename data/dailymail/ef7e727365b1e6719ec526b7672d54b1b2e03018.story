A woman who suffered from crippling body dysmorphia has overcome her illness by becoming an underwear model.

Roxy Drummond, 24, from Pembroke Dock, Pembrokeshire, used to be so self-conscious about her appearance that she applied a full face of makeup every night before going to sleep.

After years of cruel comments from school bullies who called her 'ugly', she became obsessed with her looks and would spend hours scrutinising herself in front of the mirror.

The brunette spent up to three hours a day applying makeup and even refused to open her front door unless she was wearing false eyelashes.

In 2013, Roxy was diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder - a mental condition in which the sufferer obsesses over their appearance and sees a distorted image of the way they look.

She became so anxious that she couldn't leave the house and would scrub her face until it was raw in a bid to get rid of what she thought was chronic acne.

Roxy said: 'The girls at school made my life an absolute misery and I dreaded going in every day. Sometimes I would pretend to be ill so that I wouldn't have to face them.

'All the girls would come up to me and tell me that I was ugly and looked like a boy.

'I had no confidence whatsoever and absolutely hated myself, and this self-hatred continued long after I'd finished school.

'Eventually I developed an obsession 
with every little flaw in my appearance. I had crippling anxiety every 
time I had to go outside, so I barely left the house.'

Last year she was finally diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder

Roxy, a size 8, was constantly told by friends and family that she should become a model, but because of her warped vision of herself, she never believed that she could make it.

Roxy said: 'All I could see when I looked in the mirror was a horrible, crooked face.

'I particularly hated my nose, which I thought was long and wonky - like a witch's.

'That, combined with all the non-existent spots that I could see on my face, just made me feel like a disgusting monster.

'I couldn't bear to look at myself, so I couldn't understand why anyone else would want to look at me.'

Despite hating her appearance, Roxy developed an obsession with taking selfies and would post them on Facebook and Twitter in search of reassurance from her followers.

Posting up to three new profile pictures a week, Roxy was showered with compliments from followers telling her how beautiful she was.

One leading psychiatrist said the majority of patients he sees with Body Dysmorphic Disorder take a lot of selfies.

Dr
 David Veale, a consultant psychiatrist in cognitive behaviour therapy 
at the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust and The Priory Hospital, said: 'Two out of three of all the patients who come to 
see me with Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) since the rise of camera 
phones have a compulsion to repeatedly take and post selfies on social 
media sites.'

Roxy, who volunteers for a local charity, says: 'What people don't understand is that I wasn't taking selfies because I love myself.

'It's because I had to obsessively check that I looked okay before I could go out. Plus the likes and nice comments made me feel less self-conscious about my appearance.

'I suppose it is a bit attention-seeking, but everyone likes to be told that they look nice, so I don't see the problem.'

With encouragement from her friends and 
family, Roxy entered a modelling competition and won. The buzz she felt 
from winning made her decide to beat her anxiety once and for all and 
she embarked on a professional career in modelling.

Roxy said:
 'People find it strange that I say I'm anxious about my appearance, but
 can pose for raunchy shoots. And I can completely understand where 
they're coming from.

'I suppose it does sound a bit silly when I say I'm shy and then strip off to my underwear.

'But
 something just happens when I'm in front of a camera. I feel so much 
more confident, and for that hour or so I forget about obsessing about 
the way that I look.

'The photographers are always really encouraging too, and that's a real confidence boost.'

BDD is characterised by a preoccupation with one or more perceived flaws in appearance, which are unnoticeable to others, according to the BDD Foundation.

As well as the excessive self-consciousness, individuals with BDD often feel defined by their flaw.

They often experience an image of their perceived defect associated with memories, emotions and bodily sensations - as if seeing the flaw through the eyes of an onlooker, even though what they 'see' may be very different to their appearance observed by others.

Sufferers tend repeatedly to check on how bad their flaw is  - for example in mirrors and reflective surfaces -  attempt to camouflage or alter the perceived defect and avoid public or social situations or triggers that increase distress.

People with BDD can find themselves housebound or seeking out needless cosmetic surgery. They are also at an increased risk of suicide.

Roxy hopes to grace the pages of FHM and Esquire, and her boyfriend supports her

With hopes
 of gracing the pages of FHM and Esquire, Roxy claims that modelling and
 the support of her boyfriend, labourer Josh Wilmot, 23, has helped her 
to overcome her insecurities.

Roxy said: 'Body dysmorphia is not something to be ashamed of, and there is help available.

'Along with my modelling, I have also taken part in CBT counselling - which has really helped.

'I'm
 concentrating on my modelling career at the moment, but I'd love to go 
to university and study for a qualification in psychology.

'Body
 dysmorphia is such a misunderstood condition, and it'd be wonderful to 
try and help people who are going through what I have.

'I just want people to know that it doesn't have to control their lives, and they can go on to achieve their dreams.'

While she's concentrating on modelling at the moment, Roxy also wants to study psychology one day
