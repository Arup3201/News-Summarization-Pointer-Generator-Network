Behind bars: 27-year-old teaching assistant Melissa Bradley is being accused of sleeping with two of her male students. She was arrested May 4 and charged with seven counts of endangering the welfare of a child

A teacher's assistant in New Jersey is being accused of sleeping with two male high school students.

Melissa Bradley, 27, was arrested May 4 and booked in Essex County Jail after administrators at Belleville high school reported her behavior to the police.

It's uncertain how the school found out Bradley had sexual relations with two teen students, but she is accused of having oral sex and intercourse with the boys.

The two students were born in 1996. One just turned 18 while the other is 17. It's uncertain what age the 18-year-old was when the relationship happened.

Kathy Carter of the Essex County Prosecutor's Office says Bradley had a relationship with one of the boys between May 2013 and February 2014.

The other relationship overlapped by a month and started last January to this March.

Bradley has been charged with seven counts of endangering the welfare of a child.

She is still being held on $500,000 bond at the Essex County Jail.

School district officials confirmed that they reported the incident to NJ.com, but would not elaborate on the situation.Â
