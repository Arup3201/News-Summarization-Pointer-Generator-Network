Helen Mann, 43, a primary school head teacher who killed herself in her office less than six months after starting the job at Sytchampton Endowed First School, Worcestershire

A headmistress who feared her school could lose its ‘outstanding’ Ofsted ranking was found hanged on the premises, an inquest heard yesterday.

Helen Mann, 43, was discovered on the first day of the new half-term, just seven months in to her first headship.

The mother of two had been ‘struggling profoundly with her work’ and had also been left ‘tearful’ after a governors’ meeting in which it was agreed to make a part-time teacher redundant.

She confessed to the teacher, Angela Mercer, that she found the task ‘overwhelming’, and became even more anxious when the teacher told her she would lodge a claim for unfair dismissal.

Mrs Mann died on November 5 last year, seven months after starting at Sytchampton Endowed First School in the Worcestershire village.

Dr Stephanie Gait, the school’s chairman of governors, told the hearing that within a month of Mrs Mann starting, she was told that the school was likely to be downgraded by Ofsted the next time it faced inspection.

The warning came in a report from the local authority’s ‘school improvement adviser’ following a two-day visit to the 80-pupil primary. The inquest at Stourport-on-Severn, Worcestershire, heard that the school had been ranked as ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted in its previous three or four inspections, but had been without a permanent head for five terms before Mrs Mann started.

Dr Gait told the court Mrs Mann was ‘very concerned about whenever our next Ofsted review would be’.

She added: ‘She was concerned that it wouldn’t be classified as “outstanding” if they were to come in soon. That had been mentioned in at least one governors’ meeting and we all said that we understood this would be the case but not through any fault of hers.’

Dr Gait said that while Mrs Mann was 
‘bright-eyed and bushy-tailed’ when she joined the school, she appeared 
exhausted rather than rested when she returned after the summer break.

Mrs Mann’s impressive start at the school had been ‘blighted’ by the upset she felt at having to dismiss Mrs Mercer, she said.

Mrs Mercer said she found out she was 
to lose her job only after her son was told by a pupil during a karate 
lesson at the school hall one evening last May.

She said: ‘I went to see Mrs Mann and she was clearly distressed. She was concerned for me, but also she found it overwhelming.

‘I was signed off sick for two weeks before half-term. I am told that when Mrs Mann found out, she broke down in tears.’

Kirsten Rowan, the acting head before 
Mrs Mann’s appointment, said staff thought the new head was trying to 
change ‘too much, too soon’.

Mrs Rowan said she had been off sick with 
post-traumatic stress disorder since the discovery of Mrs Mann’s body.

Mrs Mann was signed off sick just three weeks into the autumn term after collapsing in a meeting.

A month later, at the end of 
half-term, she attended a meeting to discuss a phased return to work 
after the following week’s holiday.

Jacqueline Stanley, who had been the 
head’s teaching assistant, described her appearance as ‘dreadful’ and 
said: ‘It was lovely to see her (back in school) but she looked so ill.

‘My thoughts were, “Oh my goodness – you should not be coming back to work’.”

The hearing continues.
