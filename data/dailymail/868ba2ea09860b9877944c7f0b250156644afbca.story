Boston Bruins players and officials have condemned fans’ racially charged rants directed at a black hockey player on Twitter in Boston Thursday night.

One estimate pegged the number of tweets with Montreal Canadiens defenseman P.K. Subban’s name and the n-word at about 17,000 after he scored the game winning goal for the Habs in double overtime – but the team moved quickly to distance itself from the racist remarks.

Bruins officials condemned the ‘racist’ and ‘classless’ tweets that came only days after Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling was banned for life from the NBA for expressing similar views in a recorded conversation leaked to multiple media outlets.

‘That stupid n****r doesn’t belong in hockey #whitesonly, said one tweet.

‘F**K YOU N****R SUBBAN YOU BELONG IN A F*****G HOLE NOT AN ICE RINK,’ said another.

‘F**k PK Subban. F*****g n****r. Wish he got sold,’ said yet another.

The offensive onslaught was in reaction to the Bruins blowing multiple leads to drop the first game of their playoff series 4-3.

The devastating loss was called ‘a kick to the stomach’ and compared to some of the all-time great Boston sports defeats by the Boston Globe.

Not all Bruins fans took the loss in stride.

‘Subban is the definition of a n****r,’ wrote another.

‘Someone needs to smack PK subban (sic) across his big n***** lips. #scumbag,’ said another.

Not all bad: There were many tweets in support of Subban (shown at left taking his game winning shot), including the one pictured at right

The avalanche of racist hatred making references to slavery lasted into the early hours of the morning, but most of the accounts involved have been suspended by Twitter in the hours since.

Montreal-based social analytics firm Influence Communications estimated to the CBC that about 17,000 tweets containing Subban’s name and the hateful slur flowed through Twitter immediately after the goal.

But not all of them were negative.

‘N----r was trending in Boston because P.K. Subban scored… It’s a rare moment in my life to be ashamed to be a Bruins fan,’ one person derisively wrote.

Many others were quick to point out the Bruins drafted Subban’s younger brother Malcolm only two years ago – he is currently the goalkeeper for the minor league Providence Bruins.

He has not publicly commented about the racist remarks targeting his brother.

Nor has Jarome Iginla, a biracial left winger who also plays for the Bruins. But Boston left winger Milan Lucic has.

‘It's very, very disappointing to hear that,’ he said. ‘It's really sad that people do something like that… To criticize someone about something that has nothing to do with hockey on an issue like that is very ignorant and stupid if you asked me.’

Bruins team president Cam Neely issued the following statement.

‘The racist, classless views expressed by an ignorant group of individuals following Thursday's game via digital media are in no way a reflection of anyone associated with the Bruins organization.’

The team’s coach Claude Julien told the Boston Herald the remarks were in ‘poor judgment [and] poor taste.

‘We
 don't associate ourselves with people like that. The people who think 
that way are not what we call our fans,’ he continued. ‘They may think 
they are, but we certainly don't support that at all.’

Boston Mayor Martin Walsh also chimed in.

‘These racist comments are not reflective of Boston, and are not reflective of Bruins fans,’ he said in a statement. ‘There is no room for this kind of ignorance here,’

Early reports the racial slur was trending on Twitter in Boston were debunked by Deadspin, but the stain remains.

Willie O'Ree, the National Hockey League's first black player, made his debut with the Bruins in 1958. Thee predominantly white league currently has only 23 players of African descent among its 32 teams spread across the U.S. and Canada.

The series between the fierce rivals resumes Saturday with Game 2 in Boston.
