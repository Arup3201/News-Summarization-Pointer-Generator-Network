Workers churning out toys of Olympic mascots Wenlock and Mandeville are being paid just £6 a day to toil in sweatshop conditions, a report claimed today.

Plastic figures of the London 2012 mascots - which are sold for up to £10 - are mass-produced by factory workers in China who are forced to do 120 hours' overtime a month.

Workers allegedly being exposed to hazardous conditions and being docked half a day's pay for being five minutes late were some of the other 'rampant rights violations' apparently witnessed at the factory in Guangdong province where the mascots are made.

Factory-produced: Plastic Wenlock and Mandeville toys, similar to these cuddly mascots made in Dafeng city, China, are being mass-produced by workers doing illegal amounts of overtime on miniscule daily pay

Activists who interviewed workers at the Xinda facility in Guangdong said employees worked six day weeks of up to 12 hours a day - three times the legal overtime allowed under Chinese labour laws.

At another factory in Shenzhen city, which also produces plastic toys for Locog, workers would regularly finish similarly long shifts at midnight, before starting again at 8am the next day.

The employees would also be fined half a day's salary if they were five minutes late to work.

Hard labour: An investigation earlier this year claimed that workers at Yancheng Rainbow Arts & Crafts in Dafeng city worked 11.5 hour days for 26p

Hong Kong workers' rights group Sacom (Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehaviour) also claimed workers would be fined one-and-a-half days salary if they caused a 'work stoppage' by being more than five minutes late.

Two work stoppages would see them docked six days salary, according to the report.

Locog had issued a sustainable and ethical sourcing code in 2008, which Sacom says is 'inadequate'.

The Sacom report highlighted excessive overtime, meager wages and poor worker safety in the two factories.

It
 said: 'The rampant rights violations reveal that Locog codes are really
 no more than lip service with no commitment to the enforcement of 
labour rights standards.

'The
 IOC should establish a policy and action plan for future Olympic 
Games... adopt a code of conduct for the suppliers which should include 
terms like living wages, freedom of association and the right to 
remedy.'

Earlier this year 
similar complaints had been made about another Chinese factory producing
 Wenlock and Mandeville toys for the Games.

A
 Chinese factory making toys for Shropshire-based Golden Bear was said 
to be breaching workers rights by making them labour for 11.5 hours a 
day for as little as 26p an hour.

Wenlock and Mandeville were revealed as the official London 2012 mascots in May 2010

After the latest revelations, Locog responded by claiming it has independently reviewed the two factories, and claimed 'no issues were found'.

A spokesperson told the Guardian: 'Regarding the Shiwei factory, Locog has undertaken a full review of Golden Bear's [official supplier of Olympic merchandise for London 2012] ethical trade management systems.

'Golden Bear has now fully committed to implementing all recommendations of that review and is in process of reviewing all factories in its supply chain.'
