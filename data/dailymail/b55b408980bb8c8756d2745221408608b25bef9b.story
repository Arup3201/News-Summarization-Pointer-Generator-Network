The footage is grainy and the commentary dated, but the significance of the event should not be underestimated.

In a clip preserved by British Pathe, Wolverhampton Wanderers, champions of England, take on the mighty Honved — and win.

December 13 marks the 60th anniversary of that Molineux match — played under a new kind of floodlight, which changed the shape of European football.

In front of 55,000 fans, with many more at home absorbed by a rare televised contest, Stan Cullis’s side came from two goals down to beat a team boasting six Hungarians who a year earlier had vanquished England 6-3 at Wembley. Victory for Wolves restored national pride but, more lastingly, provided the catalyst for today’s Champions League. That winter night in 1954 also played a pivotal role in the careers of Gordon Banks and George Best, and featured a cameo from a 15-year-old Ron Atkinson.

The Honved game marked the culmination of a series of friendlies against great sides from around the world, with Wolves previously beating Racing Club of Buenos Aires and Spartak Moscow.

‘Champions of the World’ is what Cullis was reported to have called his team, although old Daily Mail clippings show he subsequently denied saying that.

Such stories are still being discovered, which explains why a project has been launched to record the game’s impact for ever.

Aided by the Heritage Lottery Fund, Wolves fan Mike Crump is in the process of putting together a book and DVD, as well as making contributions to the National Football Museum. His dad celebrated his 10th birthday by watching the BBC’s broadcast of the 3-2 win.

Crump was at Molineux last Saturday alongside former England centre half Ron Flowers, one of only three surviving Wolves players from the match, to unveil the shirt worn by striker Roy Swinbourne — brought forward, after an appeal, by a woman who had won it years earlier in a raffle.

‘It’s very much of its era but using a type of silk material, specially commissioned by Stan Cullis for these internationals,’ explains Crump. ‘They were handmade by local seamstresses. Cullis had little bulbs put in the linesmen’s flags so fans could see offside decisions and it made Wolves players look like glow-worms.’

Matches under floodlights were rare in those days, but the game’s influence accelerated calls for European competition. L’Equipe editor Gabriel Hanot wrote a piece in the French newspaper shortly after the Wolves victory.

‘No, Wolverhampton are not yet the “world champion of clubs”,’ ran the headline. ‘But L’Equipe launches the idea of a European club championship... whose realisation would be new and more sensational than a European championship of national teams.’

Hanot wrote that until Wolves had travelled to Budapest or faced AC Milan and Real Madrid, they could not claim any global or continental supremacy. But UEFA came on board and the following season the European Cup was born.

It was the Honved match, against the ‘Magical Magyars’ Ferenc Puskas, Sandor Kocsis and Zoltan Czibor, which sparked it all: a mystical night in the Black Country remembered fondly by Flowers, now 80 years old.

Early goals by Kocsis and Ferenc Machos reinforced the belief that Honved were invincible, before a soft penalty award allowed Johnny Hancocks to convert from the spot. Swinbourne headed Wolves level after 76 minutes before hammering home the winner 90 seconds later.

‘It was exciting. They were special times,’ says Flowers. ‘It was a novelty, playing under lights.’

The towering pylons and halogen bulbs had been installed in September 1953 at a cost of £25,000 under instruction from Cullis.

‘It was as if an electric fuse reached all the way round the ground,’ Cullis said afterwards.

L'Equipe said that Wolves were not 'champions of the world' and called for a European club competition

Hungary had beaten England 7-1 in Budapest in March 1954 and national captain Billy Wright was in the Wolves line-up hoping for revenge. ‘It was an opportunity to test ourselves,’ says Flowers. ‘We had seen how good they were. Billy didn’t need to say anything about it. But we were confident. We had a 100 per cent record at home.’

Wolves were helped by the actions of Atkinson, then an apprentice, before kick-off. ‘Stan Cullis had us watering the pitch then rolling it while it was bucketing with rain,’ says Atkinson. ‘Honved went 2-0 up playing this one-touch passing game, but all of a sudden they couldn’t manipulate the ball and kept getting stuck.

‘Wolves were famous for their power game, long passing even though they had great players, and eventually overhauled them.’

Flowers reveals: ‘All our training was concentrated on building leg muscles. But we did a lot of work with benches and running up and down the terraces. Stan felt that our opponents would tire. What with the leather ball and the water that it gathered, you had to really belt it to move it.’

Only the second half was on the BBC, but watching back home were impressionable youngsters by the name of Best and Banks.

George Best supported Wolves as a boy and was in awe of winger Peter Broadbent

Best, then just eight and in Belfast, was a Wolves fan in awe of winger Peter Broadbent. In his autobiography he tells how he would kick a ball outside his neighbour’s house minutes before kick-off to prompt an invitation.

‘I was in the house like a shot but the next time Wolves were on the television we would play the whole charade again,’ Best wrote.

Banks, a 16-year-old Chesterfield apprentice, was inspired by goalkeeper Bert Williams. He too watched next door to home.

‘I thought Wolves would be lucky to get away with a 6-0 thrashing,’ Banks recalls. ‘I watched in awe as Bert Williams pulled out all the stops throughout the half. After the match I ran straight home to tell my dad that every penny of my pocket money was going to be spent watching him from now on.

‘There were no goalkeeping coaches in those days, see, so you had to learn by your own mistakes and by watching other keepers.’

The nucleus of the line-up that night against Honved went on to carry Wolves to the majority of their successes in the 1950s — two more titles and an FA Cup.

‘Everyone talks about the Honved team and rightly so,’ says Flowers. ‘But we did have some players. People overlook that.

‘To us, at the time, we enjoyed the matches. But who would have known what it would turn into?

‘There was a wonderful atmosphere in our town after that. I was told that thousands of people packed into the pubs and started partying.

‘It was an absolute privilege to be involved in what many people might say is the greatest sporting moment in Wolverhampton’s history.’
