Nathan Ake will stay at Chelsea this season to fight for a place in Jose Mourinho's first team.

The Blues controversially have 26 players out on loan but Ake will remain at Stamford Bridge. 

The Dutchman, who has an uncanny resemblance to fellow countryman and former Chelsea star Ruud Gullit, has been at Chelsea since 2011 but has had limited chances to impress.

However, the 19-year-old spoke about Mourinho's desire to keep him in West London this season.

'He has said that he really wanted to keep [me]. Not many boys of nineteen have been playing in the base at a club, though a lot of people seem to expect that sometimes,' Ake told the Dutch media outlet De Telegraaf.

'I know I still have time and Mourinho is pleased with me in the team so far. The way he says something and makes things clear in training. For example, if you withdraw your foot, then he gets angry. He loves people who give everything every moment.'

The Dutchman also showed his admiration of club captain John Terry.

'In a practice match against Real Sociedad during the preparation Terry was in the game only by talking to me and he tried to help me. Positionally he really helps the younger guys with everything and talks to you about where you need to work on.'

Competition: Young centre-back Kurt Zouma moved to Chelsea from St Etienne in January and may be a future partner for Ake 

With Terry and Gary Cahill forming a solid partnership at the heart of Jose Mourinho's defence, Ake has struggled to get many opportunities in the first team. 

With the signing of Kurt Zouma,19, from St Etienne in January for £12million, Mourinho may be looking to form Chelsea's next defensive pairing.
