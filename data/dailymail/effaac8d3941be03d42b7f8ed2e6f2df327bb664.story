They call it the beautiful game for a reason and, sometimes, football can be a sport of grace as much as anything else.

A group that know a thing or two about that are the German World Cup Dance Team, who have been preparing for the tournament in their own way.

With the World Cup just a week away, German stars Mesut Ozil, Per Metesacker and Lukas Podolski can only hope they have the moves to see off Portugal, Ghana and the USA in Group G.

But the main dance England fans will hope to see at the World Cup is that of striker Daniel Strurridge.

England face a battle to get out of Group D, with games against Uruguay, Costa Rica and Italy on the agenda.
