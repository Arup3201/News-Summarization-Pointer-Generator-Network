Javier Mascherano has poured cold water on his heated altercation with Cristiano Ronaldo during Barcelona's 2-1 win over Real Madrid.

A crunching tackle by Mascherano in the second half led to Ronaldo reacting with an ill-tempered, soft kick on the Argentina midfielder.

It prompted Mascherano to go down holding his face on the pitch but referee Antonio Miguel Mateu Lahoz didn't buy it, deciding to book the Barca player and let the already-cautioned Ronaldo off.

'He boiled over a little but it wasn't with bad intent,' Mascherano said. 'These sorts of things happen out on the pitch.'

Barcelona beat their rivals but were not at their best on Sunday night, yet Mascherano insists their style of play against Real should not go unnoticed. 

'Football isn't just about possession,' he continued. #This club has a way of playing and we respect that but football has many facets - it's about pressurising, about suffering when you have to and being tactically smart. We have to be a complete team and that's what we are right now.

'Teams like Madrid push you to the limit, both physically and mentally. We made a great effort, especially as we played in midweek. We came out on top and we're very happy.

'If you're not careful with Madrid they'll get on top of you. They're the best in the world at that. We started well. We controlled the game and scored, and that's when they began to push forward. 

'We gave them too much space and lost the ball too often. In the second half we re-organised ourselves. We scored and started playing our own game.'
