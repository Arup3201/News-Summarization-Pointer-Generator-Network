A female Marine tips her head back as the blood of a dead cobra is dripped into her mouth in this startling photograph of a military training exercise in the depths of the Thai jungle.

The U.S. soldier is one of around 13,000 taking part in Cobra Gold 2013, an annual, multi-national military training programme that incorporates jungle survival techniques.

After being taught how to kill the venomous snakes by Thai naval instructors, the Marines were given the option of experiencing a local custom; drinking the animals' blood.

The 11-day military exercise, taking place in Thailand's Chon Buri province, covers amphibious assault, humanitarian relief, and evacuation of friendly forces as well as jungle survival techniques.
