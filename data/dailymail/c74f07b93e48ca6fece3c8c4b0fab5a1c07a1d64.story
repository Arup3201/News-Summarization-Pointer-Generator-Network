Arsenal are exploring the free transfer market in a desperate attempt to ease their defensive problems.

The Gunners’ lack of depth in defence was apparent on Tuesday night when Arsene Wenger was left with just three senior defenders for their 2-0 defeat by Borussia Dortmund.

Arsenal are considering signing former West Brom defender Diego Lugano

The club are looking for a central defender to provide cover for Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny.

Clubs can still sign free agents despite the transfer window closing on September 1.

Scouts have been asked to examine short-term options Diego Lugano and Joseph Yobo, who are both available and have been discussed at the club’s London Colney HQ.

The pair have Premier League experience — Yobo for Everton and Norwich and Lugano with West Brom — which is key for the Gunners.

Any moves, though, are a way from fruition with the club still considering their options.

There was at least some good news for Wenger on Wednesday when scans on the right ankle of Jack Wilshere, injured in Germany, revealed no serious damage.

Also, Mathieu Debuchy who came off against Manchester City, confirmed he has avoided a broken ankle.

‘No fracture but one broken ligament,’ the Frenchman posted on his Facebook account. ‘I have to wait until Friday in order to know if I must have surgery.’

Mikel Arteta, meanwhile, admits Arsenal have no chance of winning the Champions League if they cannot solve the problems which led to their defeat in Dortmund.

‘We have to react,’ Arteta insisted. ‘If you make errors like we did against the top sides, we know there is no chance to win the Champions League.’
