A Northern California wildfire raging out of control on Friday has grown to more than three-times the size of the city of San Francisco and has spread inside the border of Yosemite National Park.

Authorities have urged more evacuations in nearby communities where thousands have fled during the week as flames marched through the timbered slopes of the western Sierra Nevada.

The fire closed backcountry hiking in the park, but was so far not threatening the popular Yosemite Valley region.

During Thursday night the blaze grew from 99 square miles to more than 165 square miles

The fire has grown from 99 square miles to more than 165 square miles overnight and is only two percent contained. Smoke blowing across the Sierra into Nevada forced officials in several counties to cancel outdoor school activities and issue health advisories, especially for people with respiratory problems.

‘Most of the fire activity is pushing to the east right into Yosemite,’ said Daniel Berlant, spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

The fire is threatening about 4,500 residences, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Officials issued voluntary evacuation advisories for two new towns on Friday - Tuolumne City, population 1,800, and Ponderosa Hills, a community of several hundred - which are about five miles from the fire, spokesman Jerry Snyder said.

A mandatory evacuation order remained in effect for part of Pine Mountain Lake, a summer gated community that's a few miles from the fire line.

Already, the blaze has destroyed four homes and 12 outbuildings in several different areas, Snyder said. One firefighter also sustained a heat-related injury.

While the park remained open, the blaze closed a 4-mile stretch of State Route 120, one of three entrances into Yosemite on the west side. The other western routes and an eastern route were open.

Within the park, the blaze was burning on about 17 square miles in a remote area around Lake Eleanor, about four miles northwest of Hetch Hetchy reservoir, Yosemite spokeswoman Kari Cobb said.

Backcountry permits are required to hike in that area, Cobb said, and the park was no longer issuing those and had contacted every person who had received a permit to go there.

Two roads into that area were closed and occupants of a campground near the Route 120 west entrance were relocated.

‘We don't have anybody we know of in that area based on the permits we have out now,’ she said.

The fire was more than 20 miles from Yosemite Valley and skies there were ‘crystal clear,’ Cobb said.

The spectacular valley carved by glaciers offers visitors such iconic sights as the Half Dome and El Capitan rock formations and Bridalveil and Yosemite falls.

‘Right now there are no closures and no visitor services are being affected in the park,’ Cobb said. ‘We just have to take one day at a time depending on fire activity.’

Officials also have advised voluntary evacuations of more than a thousand other homes, several organized camps and at least two campgrounds in the area outside the park's boundary.

More homes, businesses and hotels are threatened in nearby Groveland, a community of 600 about five miles from the fire and 25 miles from the entrance of Yosemite.

‘Usually during summer, it's swamped with tourists, you can't find parking downtown,’ said Christina Wilkinson, who runs Groveland's social media page and lives in Pine Mountain Lake.

‘Now, the streets are empty. All we see is firefighters, emergency personnel and fire trucks.’

Many area businesses have closed and people who had vacation rental homes have cancelled plans, local business owners said.

‘This fire, it's killing our financial picture,’ said Corinna Loh, whose family owns the still-open historic Iron Door Saloon and Grill in Groveland. ‘This is our high season and it has gone to nothing, we're really hurting.’

Loh said most of her employees have left town. And the family's Spinning Wheel Ranch, where they rent cabins to tourists, has also been evacuated because it's directly in the line of fire.

Two outbuildings have burned at the ranch, Loh said, and she still has no word whether the house and cabins survived.

‘We're all just standing on eggshells, waiting,’ Loh said.

The governor's emergency declaration finding ‘conditions of extreme peril to the safety of persons and property’ frees up funds and firefighting resources and helps Tuolumne County in seeking federal disaster relief. More than 2,000 firefighters are already battling the blaze.

The Yosemite County Tourism Bureau based in Mariposa has been helping tourists displaced by the fire to find new accommodations in other park-area towns, said director Terry Selk.

The
Rim Fire is the fourth-largest and fastest growing wildfire in the 
nation, National Interagency Fire Center spokesman Robyn Broyles said on Thursday.

The
fire is among the top firefighting priorities in the U.S, according to 
the National Interagency Fire Center. Currently there are 50 large 
wildfires in the West.

On
Wednesday, the fire had been 5 per cent contained and ranged across 
16,000 acres, but it grew dramatically overnight and the containment 
level fell.

Despite using 
aircraft to try to contain the fire for five days, it was still raging 
out of control with 100ft flames, according to CBS Sacramento.

Two
evacuation centers have been set up for residents, who have been urged 
to leave their homes if they suffer health conditions that could be 
affected by the thick smoke in the air. 

So far
the fire, which is mainly centered in the Stanislaus National Forest, 
has destroyed two homes and seven outbuildings since Saturday.

However, it is starting to spread to private land and is about five miles from the northwest outer edge of the national park.

The blaze is threat to about 2,500 homes and businesses in the popular vacation spot.

The private summer community of Pine Mountain Lake, which has a population of 2,800, has been voluntarily evactuated, along with several other campgrounds.

Yosemite, which spans 750,000 acres, attract nearly 4 million visitors last year, according to the park website.

Park officials were forced to stop 
traffic on Highway 120, one of four access routes to the park, on 
Tuesday because of the fire.

'This is typically a very busy time for us until Labor Day, so it's definitely affecting business not having the traffic come through to Yosemite,' Britney Sorsdahl, manager at the Iron Door Saloon and Grill in Groveland, five miles from the fire, said.

Christina Wilkinson, who lives in Pine Mountain Lake near Groveland, said: 'Usually during summer, it's swamped with tourists, you can't find parking downtown. Now, the streets are empty. All we see is firefighters, emergency personnel and fire trucks.'

Tourist cabins on a Groveland ranch directly in the fire's path have been evacuated and a couple of buildings on the site burned down.

'This fire, it's killing our financial picture. This is our high season and it has gone to nothing, we're really hurting,' Corinna Loh, who owns the Spinning Wheel Ranch and Iron Door Saloon, told the Modesto Bee.

She added that most of her employees had left the small town of about 600 people.

At an emergency meeting in Tuolumne County supervisors voted to ask Governor Jerry Brown to declare a state of emergency and free funds for the firefight.

There are no immediate plans to close the park, Yosemite ranger Scott Gediman said, adding that the sky above the park had been clear of smoke on Thursday.

The cause of the Rim Fire is under investigation.

The U.S Forest Service, the leading wildfire-fighting agency, is running out of money to deal with the large number of fires this year.

It has spend $967 million so far this year and was down to just $50 million - enough to cover just a few days of fighting blazes - before it was forced to divert $600 million in funds from other areas too boost its reserve.
