Police in Los Angeles have arrested a suspect in connection to the murder of celebrity tattoo artist Michael 'Trigz' Pebley.

Robert Falcon, 31, from Sylmar, California, was arrested Tuesday and charged with murder in the October 9 shooting outside a North Hollywood store.

According to investigators, Pebley and Falcon got into a verbal spat at Black Derby Smoke Shop on Laurel Canyon Boulevard, which quickly turned physical.

Justice for Trgiz: A suspect has been arrested and charged with killing tattoo artist to the stars Michael 'Trigz' Pebley earlier this month 

Where's it all started: Pebley got into an altercation with a Black Derby customer over a passing remark

The fight spilled out onto the sidewalk outside the business, at which point Falcon allegedly pulled out a handgun and shot Pebley.

Robert Falcon is being held in jail on $2million bail, reported ABC7.

According to the manager of the smoke shop, Pebley was minding his own business  when an apparent stranger upset him with a pointed remark leaving the store at around 5.40pm on October 9.

Pebley, who was talking to the store owner, was angered and approached the man, 'getting in his face', which sparked a 30-second fight inside. The two men then walked outside, and the confrontation ended with Pebley being fatally shot outside the neighboring Tattoo & Body Piercing parlor. 

Asked what could have sparked such a violent and ultimately fatal fight, a witness said that he had been told the suspect turned to Pebley and asked him 'Where do I know you from?'

'That might may sound like nothing, but round here the way you say that could be the difference to starting a fight or not,' he said.

Witness Brandon Wilmot, 22, a security officer for Valley Plaza was working opposite the shop when the shooting took place.

‘He got shot but nobody heard any of the gunshots or anything. The cops and ambulance came up and they were trying to revive him for about five minutes, then they ended up just pulling the white sheet over him,' said Wilmot.

'When I walked down the street I could see the sheet over him and see his feet sticking out.

'He was a known local person and a good guy. When the cops came the people out of the tattoo shop came out and they were hysterical. A lot of his apprentices work at that tattoo parlor.'

Pebley's friend, actor Carlos Ayala, 35, said that it was 'probably fear that got Trigz killed. 

‘I worked with him on many videos. I’ve known him since 2002, we did SWAT together and the video for Rick Ross’ Don’t Play No Games with Future.

‘Just because he looks how he looks people shouldn’t judge. He was a real nice guy.'

The famed tattoo artist worked with Chris Brown, Kylie Jenner's reported boyfriend Tyga as well as Amber Rose's soon-to-be-ex Wiz Khalifa and musician Travis Barker. 

Just after news broke of the murder, Brown tweeted, 'RIP homie. S*** it crazy!' 

Trigz  became part of an exclusive worldwide group of artists called The Seventh Letter, fellow member and friend Willie T told Eyewitness News. 

Venice photographer and skater Pep Williams announced Trigz's death on his Facebook page, saying, 'Lost another brother just a couple of hours ago. Many good memories from shooting, grubbing and hanging at the traphouse. Love you brother.' 

Trigz left behind his fiancee, Honey Miranda, and five children. Miranda was among the people who discovered his lifeless body on the street. 

He was often used as a model in music videos and in magazine shoots and was a member of the renowned Seventh Letter graffiti artist crew. 

Trigz, a.k.a. Mr. Trigger, worked out of Sincity Tattoo in Pacoima, where he specialized in body piercing.

Trigz’s son has started a GoFundMe account to help pay for his funeral expenses. 

Pebley's two sons, Michael and Anthony both expressed their pain at the death of their father by posting a picture of them both sitting on his knee dating from 1997. 

Michael, who has set up a GoFundMe page was equally distraught, asking friends, family and members of the public to help donate money for his father's funeral.

Despite the glowing tributes paid by friends, the veteran tattoo artist was known for his checkered history with the law.

As recently as 2009, Pebley, or Trigz, was incarcerated in Ironwood State Prison in Blythe serving a six year sentence for graffiti.

He was arrested on 12 counts of vandalism and while he only served around 18 months, the prison sentence was seen as harsh nonetheless.

Speaking to local media about his time in jail, Pebley said that prison was as good as could be expected.

'I've got some cool homies who have stayed tough for me on the streets which helps a villain keep my head high and my eyes open in this shark tank,' said Pebley.

He also touched on his body art being a source of prejudice and claimed that he was dealt with differently by the courts because of them.
