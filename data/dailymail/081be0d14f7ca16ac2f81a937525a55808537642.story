David Cameron today revealed how the rough and tumble of life in politics had not prepared him for the onslaught of abuse from Twitter trolls, telling him to lose weight and wishing he was dead.

The Prime Minister said he had been stunned by the stream of vitriol which every message on the site attracted – though he let slip it is not always him typ[ing the 140 characters.

As Tory leader in 2009 he declared on live radio that he would not join Twitter, warning: ‘Too many tweets might make a t***.’

David Cameron revealed how an apparently innocuous picture of him talking on the telephone to Barack Obama attracted an angry response about his weight

But this autumn the PM announced he would be making a foray into the Twittersphere, promising an ‘edgier’ outlook than the official Number 10 account which is monitored by civil servants.

Nothing Mr Cameron has posted since has come close to the bitter response from other users to his @David_Cameron account.

‘You get a lot of abuse in politics, I don’t mind that, but you have to get used to trolls,’ Mr Cameron told a lunch for journalists in Parliament.

‘Trolls are my new favourite things. I have had some very good things.’

However, he admitted that aides are more likely to be posting to the account than himself. Last month a photograph was released on the account of him talking on the telephone, apparently to US President Barack Obama.

‘I tweeted the other day, apparently –
or someone tweeted on my behalf – I tweeted the other day about that 
picture of me talking to Barack Obama, celebrating the special 
relationship and his re-election.

‘And a particularly unpleasant troll 
tweeted back: “Nevermind the special relationship…looks like you’d do 
better on the Special K diet.”

News of a royal baby was not enough to stop one of the PM's trolls from wishing he was dead

He also revealed that an apparently 
harmless message responding to the news that Prince William and Kate 
were expecting a baby had been seized on by trolls.

Here is a selection of some of the comments which @David_Cameron was bombarded with soon after starting his account:

‏@Gaslef mornin dave, what atrocities are you planning to inflict on the working classes today then? #toriesruiningthenation

‏@Codeine74 Hello Dave, this is your daily reminder that thousands of Britain's most vulnerable people are suffering more thanks to you.

@thisisamy_
I am seriously angry by @David_Cameron 's comments. Stop LYING & 
pretending you're helping the poor & vulnerable. You do not care one
bit.

@Chad_C_Mulligan Yawn. Another super-shiny PR opportunity. Why aren't your sleeves rolled up, Dave?

‏@Bethemediauk I thought you said you wouldn't tweet much. That's 7 now. 7 too many.

‘I tweeted that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would make wonderful parents, and the troll rapidly tweeted back “and you’d make a wonderful corpse”. This is what happens on Twitter.’

The Prime Minister did not appear to regret his u-turn after ruling out joining Twitter, saying it had added to an ‘interesting year’ for me.

Media watchdog Ofcom cleared Absolute Radio of breaching broadcasting regulations despite 20 complaints from listeners after Mr Cameron’s foul-mouthed outburst on the Christian O’Connell breakfast show in 2009.

‘The adjudication from Ofcom is on the wall in Number 10 Downing Street,’ he said today.

When someone joked it was hanging in ‘the loo’, the PM replied: ‘No, it’s in the hallway it’s a beautiful thing between two people.’

Mr Cameron also revealed that he did not watch 
suspended Conservative MP Nadine Dorries on TV reality show I'm a 
Celebrity Get Me Out of Here, but said that he would be 'tempted' to 
vote for Boris Johnson to undergo a bushtucker trial if the London 
Mayor ever went onto the ITV show.

But the PM appeared to blunder when he claimed to have voted for Will Young to win the X Factor on the orders of his daughter Nancy.

However, Young won the first series of Pop Idol in 2002 - two years before Nancy's birth in 2004.

Mr Cameron also revealed that he once had a 'fantastic conversation' trying to explain I'm A Celebrity to Margaret Thatcher, when the former Prime Minister's daughter Carol was a
contestant in 2005.

With millions of people – and potential voters – on Twitter, the lure of the site became too strong to resist for the PM.

Ahead of the Tory party conference in October, Mr Cameron announced his arrival on the site with a 
reference to his 2009 warning: ‘I'm starting Conference with this new 
Twitter feed about my role as Conservative Leader. I promise there won't
be "too many tweets...’

Before the account was set up aides 
promised it would be an ‘edgy’ and ‘more political’ outlet for the Prime
Minister to target voters.

One of the first pictures Mr Cameron posted on his Twitter account featured a caterpillar birthday cake presented to him by his staff

To
date it has been rather more sedate, consisting of posts praising 
speeches by colleagues, alerting people to imminent TV appearances and 
photos of charity work. Mr Cameron was the 370th MP to start an account.

Within
12 hours the account had 75,000 followers but bookmakers Ladbrokes were
offering odds of 25/1 that he would reach 100,000 before the Tory 
conference in Birmingham closed. He now has almost 184,000 followers.
