Arsenal's majority shareholder Stan Kroenke is set to be questioned over a £3million payment to another of his companies.

Kroenke will be quizzed by other shareholders at the club’s AGM on Thursday over money paid to Kroenke Sports Enterprises (KSE) for ‘strategic and advisory fees’. 

The Arsenal Supporters’ Trust want a breakdown of the services provided by KSE — the company that controls Kroenke’s sports teams in the US — and to establish if there was a competitive tender for the work.

Pressure on Arsene Wenger is likely to have eased after he led Arsenal to the FA Cup last season

It will also ask whether this is likely to be a regular payment or if it was a one-off.

Arsenal supporters will also question manager Arsene Wenger’s failure to strengthen the defence sufficiently over the summer.

Wenger is still likely to face some fierce questioning on the lack of defensive cover in his first team squad

But with Arsenal winning the FA Cup, the atmosphere is likely to be less tense than in recent years.

As well as Wenger and Kroenke, chairman Sir Chips Keswick and chief executive Ivan Gazidis are also expected to answer questions.
