A weight loss expert has been slammed by plus-size campaigners for his new project: Warn A Friend They're Fat Day. 

TV star Steve Miller, presenter of the TV show Fat Families, had designated today as the day for Britons to tell close friends or family members that they are overweight.

But the move has been widely criticised, with members of the plus-size community saying the scheme amounts to fat-shaming and bullying.

Steve floated the idea of Warn A Friend They're Fat Day late last year and even wrote a letter to the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt about the issue. 

The idea is for people to bring up the issue of obesity with a close friend or family member who is overweight. 

The person would then offer to become an exercise buddy if their friend does decide to try and shift some pounds as a result of the conversation.  

Steve claims that the initiative could save thousands of lives.

He told FEMAIL: 'This day is about saving lives, it is absolutely not about humiliating people.

'I am proposing to people that they do all of this in a very sensitive manner and only with friends or family that they are extremely close to. 

'It should also only be said to people that you think can handle the information - if you think it will send them the other way, don't do it. 

'Then after you have told them, offer to go to the gym together or take up walking together.

'I know that the word fat sounds harsh but when you use that word, people take notice - if you wrap the issue up in cotton wool, it doesn't work.'

Would you tell a friend they are fat?  

But Rivkie Baum, the editor of plus-size fashion magazine Slink, disagrees - she thinks Steve's campaign is going to have the reverse effect. 

She said: 'Recent studies have shown that telling a friend they're fat, whether you are concerned or otherwise can actually lead to further weight gain.

'Not to mention the way it might change your friendship. 

'I find it amazing that people seem to believe that someone who is fat is unaware of it.'

She continued: 'We live in a media culture that constantly points out what are perceived to be physical flaws on a daily basis.

'The issue of our bodies and our relationship with them is incredibly complicated and Steve's initiative doesn't seem to take any of this into account.

'If the issue of weight, body image and obesity was this simple, surely we wouldn't even be having this conversation.' 

Rivkie Baum believes the only way people will reach their goal, is if they want it

Rivkie  is so disgusted with Warn A Friend They're Fat Day  that she and a group of fellow plus-size campaigners have launched a counter movement called Tell A Friend They're Fab.

Rivkie told FEMAIL: '#youarefab is the antidote for people fed up with the long list of detox and diets that are forced upon us in January and a welcome break to the body image negativity that campaigns like Steve's can throw up.

'If someone does want to lose weight, the only way they will reach their goal, is if they want it. 

'If your friend or family member wants your help losing weight, they will ask for it - then is your time to step up. 

'But if that doesn't happen, appreciate that their body is their business and use #youarefab to remind each other of the reason you're friends in the first place.'

While Rivkie thinks Steve's campaign is harmful, he believes #youarefab is equally dangerous and has been tweeting his opposition this afternoon 

But while Rivkie thinks Steve's campaign is harmful, he believes  #youarefab is equally dangerous. 

He said: 'The fat acceptance brigade are in my opinion dangerous, because what they are saying is you are OK to be fat and fabulous.

'That is completely wrong in my opinion. 

'You are basically saying to someone, stay fat and you might die early and that is fine. That is wrong.'
