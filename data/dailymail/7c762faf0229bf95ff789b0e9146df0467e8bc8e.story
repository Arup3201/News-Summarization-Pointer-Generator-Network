Some dogs are born with the ability to make impressive catches with their mouths.

And some dogs, like Fritz the golden retriever from California, are not – as demonstrated by its owner, who collated  the canine's failed attempts to catch different food items in slow motion.

Standing before the camera the dog initially looks calm, composed and ready to make its owner proud.

Spotting the piece of meat the dog licks its lips in anticipation and locks its eyes on the prize.

The owner tosses the piece of meat, which travels in a straight line and at a good pace towards the dog.

But as Fritz opens his mouth to make the catch, he leans back just too far and the meat hits him  in the face.

Next up is a doughnut, and while not the healthiest piece of food for a dog, one would think the bigger surface area would surely make the task easier.

Jumping too eagerly once more Fritz mistimes the doughnut's flight and the food item hits him in the neck.

With a new Stars and Stripes bandana comes new opportunities in the form of a meatball and a taco, but the dog once again makes a mess of the catches and the taco explodes against its face.

Gaining a crowd, the dog later attempts to catch a strawberry but despite following the flight of the fruit it ricochets off his nose and onto the floor.

The final food items include a hot dog, which covers him in ketchup, and a slice of pizza, which collides awkwardly with his ear.

The video concludes with a moment of success as the golden retriever manages to catch a single chip with the side of its mouth.
