Sony has been accused of demeaning women and pandering to the sleaziest urges of teenage boys with a new advert comparing playing video games to masturbation.

The online clip, reportedly published to Sony Europe's YouTube channel on Friday, features an attractive woman dressed as a doctor who gives an entire monologue of double entendres. 

'I know you've already done it today, and I bet you really enjoyed yourself,' says the woman, who for the purposes of this promotional fantasy is identified as Dr Grace Powels.

'I know you've already done it today': This is the face of the 'doctor' in the suggestive new PlayStation 4 advert than was apparently published on Sony's YouTube channel then set to private as a backlash grew

She pulls off her spectacles, pouts, leans into the camera and breathes: 'How many times did you do it yesterday? Are you afraid you're doing it too often?

'In the bedroom under your blankets? Or perhaps you prefer the kitchen or in the toilet? Or do you like it out in the garden?' she continues, climbing onto her desk as close-up shots focus on her full lips.

'You no longer have to feel ashamed. Everybody's doing it, because it's fantastic. And now you can keep going all day long. Don't you like that? You don't even need to stop. And if you want to, you could even join me.'

At the point the punchline is revealed. 'Dr Powels' wasn't being sexually suggestive, she was merely talking about a new remote control feature for her PS Vita hand-held games console.

Reg Bailey, Chief Executive of Mothers’ Union and author of the government review on Letting Children be Children said: 'It’s a sad poor use of advertising using the innuendo and sex sells type of argument; the advertising industry is capable of doing much better.

'Really good advertising recognises that the way individuals are portrayed in any public space influences the way we behave in our private lives, and therefore that advertising takes a responsible role in protecting the dignity of all people and ensuring that all are treated with equal respect. 

'Mothers’ Union believes that it is not right to sexually objectify a person or base their value solely on their sexual identity at any age.' 

'Problematic': Commentators have said the advert plays into old-fashioned ideas about video gamers

The Verge's Kwame Opam called the themes exploited by the advert 'problematic'.

'Our sexy doctor is pretty clearly designed to entice the straight teen male demographic gaming companies have been pandering to for decades,' he wrote.

'The innuendo makes that clear, even if Sony subverts it. That's alienating enough, since gaming has struggled so long for inclusivity.

'And even if the doctor merrily joins in on the fun (gaming, that is), it's after the fact — she's a sexy lady first and a gamer second, never fully eroding what the target always is.'

Rob Beschizza wrote on BoingBoing that Sony's Playstation advertising had gone from 'clever and weird' to making him 'think of a ship burning faster than it can sink.'

MailOnline contacted Sony Computer Entertainment UK for comment, but had received no response by the time of publication.
