Germany will veto Romania and Bulgaria's bid to join the Schengen passport-free zone if the Eastern European countries push for membership this week.

Interior minister Hans-Peter Friedrich warned both nations that if they insist on entry into the scheme 'Germany will veto it and they will fail.'

The countries are expected to apply to join the group in a meeting on Thursday, but their bid has been undermined by fears non-Europeans could bribe their way in to the countries and then travel elsewhere in the EU with ease.

It is strong language from a politician well versed in more diplomatic speak, but Germany is undergoing an invasion of immigrants from both countries with many cities experiencing extreme social tensions as a result.

Problems: The mayor of Duisburg, Germany, claims Bulgarian and Romanian migrants are creating havoc in the city

Only last Friday the left-wing mayor 
of the former industrial city of Duisburg spoke of rubbish mountains, 
children of immigrants organised into gangs for stealing expeditions and
an apartment block for 200 housing nearly 400 Romanians and Bulgarians.

The Schengen accord allows 
participating nations to allow its citizens to pass borders without 
having to show a passport. 26 nations participate, though Britain has always opted out of it due to security concerns.

If Romania and Bulgaria did join Schengen, their citizens would still need a passport to enter Britain, but immigrants would be able to pass through Eastern Europe to countries such as France or the Netherlands, making it much easier to smuggle themselves into the UK.

When asked if either Romania or 
Bulgaria could have a Schengen entry at a major air or seaport, Mr 
Friedrich said 'no,' adding: 'The concept of freeing up certain areas, 
such as arrivals by air or via seaports, is likewise unacceptable.

'The EU has long been evaluating 
whether or not Romania and Bulgaria are ready for acceptance in the 
Schengen area. The last annual report showed progress, but it's not 
enough.

'Bulgaria and Romania still have to 
be more decisive in the fight against corruption. Those who acquire a 
visa through bribery could travel all the way to Germany without further
controls.

'Our citizens will only accept an 
expansion of the Schengen area if some fundamental conditions have been 
met. That is not yet the case.'

'Mountains of rubbish': Soeren Link described mountains of waster 'taller than I am' outside buildings housing the city's Roma community

The minister also called for stricter
sanctions for anyone who tried to cheat a country's social security 
system. Britain particularly fears this scenario when its labour market 
is opened to Romanians and Bulgarians in January next year.

The Netherlands is also staunchly 
opposed to Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen club. With 
expectations of admission low, Romanian prime minister Victor Ponta now 
says his country's membership of Schengen was 'no longer a priority', 
even though it is on the agenda for the Thursday meeting.

But he added: 'The government has done everything it could so that the decision is positive and I still have hopes for that.'

Mr Friedrich, in a parting shot aimed
at Brussels mandarins who take decisions without consulting the people 
of the EU, added: 'The Commission has to learn to pay closer attention 
to the viewpoints and sensitivities of the people in EU member states.

'The basic attitude of "Oh, we'll 
just turn a blind eye, the main thing is that the EU continues to grow,"
is no longer acceptable for those who have to answer to the citizenry.'

'Social unrest': Interior minister Hans-Peter Friedrich, left, has warned against the influx of immigrants coming from Eastern Europe as Duisburg, right, continues to struggle with its Roma community

Soeren Link, the left-wing mayor of 
Duisburg, close to the border with Holland, claims prostitution and 
robberies have spiked since the EU's latest members began arriving last 
year.

'We are massively affected,' said the
mayor, confirming the fears of the Association of German Cities which 
recently warned of 'social unrest' because of the economic refugees.

He spoke of rubbish mountains 
'taller than I am' outside of dilapidated housing blocks in the district
where, in one, 400 Bulgarians and Romanians are crammed into just over 
40 apartments.

'Children are misused there and sent on stealing missions,' he claimed in a TV discussion about the problem.

Germany
is the continent's most socially-minded nation with a lavish array of 
welfare benefits. Some Roma families are claiming over Â£2,000 a month in
child welfare payments, even though they are technically not supposed 
to work in the country until January next year.

'Massively affected': Duisburg's mayor claims Romanian and Bulgarian migrants are costing the city millions per year

'It
is costing us millions and will cost us more by next year,' added Mr 
Link, who said anyone who thought the problem was going to go away was
'misty eyed'.

He added: 'We didn't ask for this 
problem and we can't handle it alone.' On his Facebook page the mayor 
wrote: 'Platitude slogans and strong words do not help!'

His outspokenness earned him the 
praise of citizens including pensioner Heinz Hoffmann, 67, who said: 'If
my rubbish spills out on the street I would be slapped with a summons 
in no time. Why do they get away with it?'

Housewife Baerbel Kramer, 57, added: 'I have sympathy for the poor people, but we are also afraid of them.'
