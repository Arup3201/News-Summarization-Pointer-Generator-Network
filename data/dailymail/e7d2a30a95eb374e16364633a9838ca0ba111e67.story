It's the home of high unemployment figures, buildings flattened during World War II and the melancholy poetry of Philip Larkin. And now Hull - once cruelly nicknamed Hell - is set to have its very own cruise ship terminal. 

Since being named the UK City of Culture 2017, gaining the unanimous backing of the judging panel and seeing off competition from Dundee, Leicester and Swansea Bay, there's an undeniable buzz.  

And City Council leaders are 'intent' on bringing a £17m cruise ship terminal to the Humber estuary, council leader Steve Brady has said.

Named the UK City of Culture 2017, Hull Council leader are sure a cruise ship terminal will boost their economy

The authority has agreed to spend £380,000 on initial studies for the project, which is set to be up and running by 2017.

It would be used as a half-day stop-off point and sited near iconic landmark,The Deep aquarium.

Councillor Brady believes the move would give Hull's economy a major boost. He said: 'It's not a time to be faint-hearted – this is a time to invest in the city for the future. 

'It's going to be a high-quality terminal. We want it to last the city for generations,' he told the Hull Daily Mail.

In winning the City of Culture, the east Yorkshire city was praised for showing 'real understanding' of what the title was about in a bid built around the theme 'a city coming out of the shadows'.

Tourist attractions include the historic Old Town and Museum Quarter and Hull Marina.The redevelopment of one of Hull's main thoroughfares, Ferensway, included the opening of St. Stephen's Hull and the new Hull Truck Theatre.

The city's tourism value could be further boosted if it wins a race to host flagship aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious when the vessel is decommissioned by the Royal Navy.

The ship would be moored by the terminal in 2017 and the following year if Hull wins.

A shortlist of bidders is set to be announced soon.

Councillor Brady said: 'Without it, the terminal is still fine because we will have the trade coming in.

'But if the Government makes the decision for Hull then we've got the ideal place.'

The study announced this week is just the first step. But Councillor Brady said he is convinced the project will go ahead and feels sure it would boost footfall.

Cllr Brady said: 'It's a lot of technical work at the moment. It's not going to be something that will be forgotten about.

'Our emphasis is moving the city forward.'
