Paedophile rock star Ian Watkins is set to receive a £150,000 pay-out from the sale of Lostprophets' management company

Paedophile singer Ian Watkins is set to receive an almost £150,000 payout from the sale of his former band's management company.

The rock star is serving a 29-year sentence  for the attempted rape of a baby and scores of other sickening child sex offences.

The singer's conviction forced his former band, Lostprophets, to break up and distribute their assets worth more than £700,000.

His four former band mates made the decision to wind up the firm - called Goonies Touring Company Ltd - after he was jailed in November 2013.

It had almost £200,000 in cash plus more than £500,000 in assets and will be split five ways.

This means 37-year-old Watkins, who had an appeal to reduce his jail term refused, is set to receive £147,497. 

A source told the Sunday Mirror: 'He is entitled to the money because it is cash earned by the band before this scandal broke. 

'Many people will feel revulsion that he will have a nice little nest egg waiting for him when he's freed but it is his cash and it will go to him.'

As well as the huge lump sum, Watkins is still earning royalties from Lostprophets' music, despite the band splitting up and forming a new group without the paedophile.

Music lawyer Craig Brookes explained last year that as the band's lyricist, Watkins will be in line for a big cut of any fees generated.

'The biggest income stream will almost certainly be publishing which, even if radio play has stopped, will still be pretty big,' he told Wales on Sunday.

'This is because PRs and their equivalents in different countries allocate money on a spot-check basis.

'So you're going to get money for plays in gyms and hairdressers and on jukeboxes and all that stuff.

'They will say, "This is how much music is in the market place so it is likely you are due this amount."'

Lostprophets were founded in Pontypridd, south Wales, in 1997 and the band sold about 3.5 million albums worldwide.

His former bandmates have turned their back on him - saying they are 'heartbroken, angry, and disgusted' at his sex crimes and have urged more of his victims to contact police.
