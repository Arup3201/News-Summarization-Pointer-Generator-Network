Hundreds of British holidaymakers had their summer getaway plans needlessly disrupted yesterday after Heathrow Airport cancelled one in five flights for a storm that never happened.

Forecasters warned of a thundery conditions sweeping through London between 4pm and 6pm, leading to the cancellation of more than 20 flights. Around 100 jets would normally take off from Heathrow during that period.

But frustrated passengers – many with children – glared through the terminal windows at a cloudless sky. 

The deluge hit the West Country and the Midlands instead – more than a month’s rainfall fell in the regions yesterday. There were even tornados in some places.

The Gloucestershire village of Westonbirt was the wettest place in Britain, with 3in of rain falling in 11 hours. ‘More than half of that total fell between 9am and 11am,’ said Met Office forecaster Tom Morgan. ‘Almost one and a half times the average rainfall for the whole of July fell during the day.’

Patients on a cardiology ward at the Royal United Hospital in Bath were transferred after heavy rain brought down part of a ceiling at 2am.

The 27 patients, who were all unharmed, were taken to other parts of the hospital.

There was localised flooding and road closures due to the sudden downpours, and the Environment Agency issued 60 warnings across the South West and Midlands.

Heavy rain also fell in Dorset, Wiltshire, Gloucestershire and Worcestershire. The Environment Agency’s John Curtin said: ‘Intense heavy rainfall will bring surface water flood risk for England throughout the weekend.

‘Flooding can happen very quickly and the public are urged to keep checking local weather forecasts and the Environment Agency website for information.’

Meanwhile, freak hail storms hit Coventry, Derby and Sheffield, and there were reports of mini-tornados in Swindon.

Manchester Airport said an electrical surge caused by thunderstorms had led to some minor delays. Throughout the UK there were 3,000 lightning strikes during just two hours in the early hours of yesterday. A family of four were made homeless after the roof of their semi-detached bungalow was set on fire by lightning in Holland-on-Sea, Essex.

But as the wild weather continued to move north last night, the UK was still under a ‘yellow’ heatwave warning, advising people to be ‘alert and ready’.

The Met Office said there was a 60 per cent chance of the heatwave continuing today, with temperatures predicted to cool gradually next week.
