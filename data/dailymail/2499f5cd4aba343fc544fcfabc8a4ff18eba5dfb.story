Scientists have been searching for the key to anti-ageing for years, but one woman from Hull reckons she has found the answer -dating younger men.

Laila Gledhill, 61, doesn't look a day over 40 and she claims it is all down to the age of the men that she dates. 

Since turning 40 more than two decades ago, Laila has married a 22-year-old army officer, been engaged to a 27-year-old, and is currently dating a university postgraduate student.

Laila Gledhill, 61, from Hull, doesn't look a day over 35 and says it's down to dating toyboys. In last 20 years, she was married to a soldier, 22, engaged to a 27 year old and she now dates a university student

Laila claims to have dated over thirty toyboys in her life, who she meets either through online dating website ToyBoyWarehouse.com or on a night out.

The administrative officer from Hull, Yorkshire said: 'No man over 40 has ever approached me.

'Dating toyboys has kept me looking young and given me a zest for life.

'I feel like my appearance has stood still in time because of the way younger men treat me.

'From my experience, younger men treat older women with respect, find them infinitely more attractive and genuinely enjoy their company. And the sex is so much better.

'Older men often have baggage and a bigger belly. Why should I be with a sixty-year-old man when I can be one who is twenty-four?

While her contemporaries collect their free bus passes, Laila can be found in nightclubs being approached by young professionals or holidaying with mates who are decades younger. In fact, she has often found herself to be the object of envy of younger women (pictured on holiday in Egypt last August)

While her contemporaries collect their free bus passes, Laila can be found in nightclubs being approached by young professionals or holidaying with mates who are decades younger.

In fact, she has often found herself to be the object of envy of younger women.

Laila said: 'A group of twenty-something women became jealous of me when their boyfriends remarked that I was attractive.

'The girls made some nasty comments regarding my body, saying that it must be wrinkly under my clothes.

'So to show them, I took some racy photos of me in my swimwear and posted them to Facebook!'

Laila wasn't always a cougar though. 

In fact, her adult life started very conventionally, when she married her childhood sweetheart, Marcus aged 27.

After fourteen years of marriage, Laila's first husband Marcus declared that he was leaving her for a younger woman

'We met when I was seventeen and we married each other a decade later.

'Although even Marcus was two years younger than me - I like to consider him my first toyboy!' 

But after fourteen years of marriage, Marcus declared that he was leaving Laila for a younger woman.

She said: 'He was my first love. We had known each other since we were teenagers.

'But now Marcus was telling me he wanted to leave me for a woman in her early thirties who was thinner, taller and prettier than me.

'Marcus walking out on me made me really think about what I deserved in life and from men.

'He had met me as a young woman and now he said I was too old for him. I knew there had to be younger men out there who truly appreciated me and for my age too.

And a few weeks later, the now 41-year-old divorcee met a handsome 21-year-old army officer called David.

Laila adds: 'It was so funny because a few months after walking out, Marcus called and begged me to take him back.

'I responded with "Sorry Marcus but I've met someone who's younger  and fitter than you".

'Divorcing Marcus and meeting David was a huge turning point for me. I realised I didn't have to settle for someone just because he was my own age.

'There were men decades younger than myself who fancied me.'

David fell head-over-heels in love with Laila and popped the question after a year of dating.

When he was posted to Germany, they moved together and the pair were happily married for five years. 

But David's parents disliked the fact that Laila was much older than him.

She said: 'His family were unhappy about the age gap between David and I. That finally came between us and we split up.

'But today, we are still friends and what happened during our marriage is water under the bridge.

'David still rings me on a daily basis and he hasn't met anyone else since.

'He is 40-years-old now and ironically, I still date under that age. Life is strange.'

Laila admits that prejudice towards older women dating toyboys has been something that she has encountered all of her life.

She said: 'It's very sad that people can be so critical about age-gap relationships. Some don't understand why a young man would go out with an older woman.

'But several twenty-something men have told me that they just don't like dating young women because they're needy, moody, materialistic and want to be treated like princesses.

'Older women are independent, confident, sexy and have all of the material things they could wish for.'

Laila was 55 at the end of her second marriage, but she regained her confidence by dating a man called Peter who was just 28 years old. 

Two years later, he proposed.

They were happily engaged for two more years after that until Laila had suspicions that Peter was cheating on her.

She said: 'I was on Peter's emails and I noticed some messages from a online dating website called 'ToyBoy Warehouse' in his Inbox, so I did some research.

'I joined that dating website to see what he was up to and discovered that he was messaging other older women, so I broke up with him immediately.'

However, there was a silver lining to the revelation that Peter was cheating.

Laila explains: 'When I joined ToyBoyWarehouse.com, I was bombarded by hundreds of messages and compliments from young professional men.

'I couldn't even respond to all of them - there were so many that it was like being in a sweet shop full of good looking toyboys. 

'So I decided to stay on the website.'

Laila hasn't looked back since Peter and now she uses toyboywarehouse.com as her primary way of meeting toyboys - she is currently dating a few young men from the site. 

Apart from her dates with young men, Laila enjoys a sensible diet and does regular, moderate exercise to maintain her youthful appearance.

She said: 'I eat sensibly - lots of chicken, lemon and fruits and I take long walks and do belly dancing at home.

'We can pick and choose the men that we want to date. In my mother's generation for example, it was a different situation.

'My mother had to rely on my father for everything and she didn't have the freedom in middle-age that I have now.

'If a woman wants to date toyboys, they should. There's no problem with it.

'Can you imagine how different I would look now if I was with an older man?'
