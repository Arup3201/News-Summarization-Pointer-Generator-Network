Right up to its last meaningful moments — the somewhat whimpering surrender of Wednesday’s final four games — Andy Murray’s reign as Wimbledon champion never went to plan.

A lack of motivation last summer, spinal surgery in September, the loss of his coach in March, the long haul back without reaching a final — the fairytale of 2013 turned out to be shortlived.

And then came Goldenballs Grigor Dimitrov to administer the last rites in a fashion few expected. The 23-year-old Bulgarian always possessed the means to make this difficult but the margin of 6-1, 7-6, 6-2 seemed unthinkable at the start of the day.

Having played as hard as a slab of Scottish granite in the opening four rounds Murray turned to mush. It took 77 years for a British man to win Wimbledon again and, with this particular match, you wanted to see more of a full-blooded scrap when it came to retaining the title.

Of course the Bulgarian deserves huge credit for pulling off what should be a career-changing win, and the three magnificent points he played from 4-4 in the tiebreak to go two sets up were the stuff of great champions.

We have waited years for a breakout performance from a younger player on the Centre Court, now two have come along in 24 hours with 19-year-old Nick Kyrgios and Dimitrov.

When he went two sets up it was the same situation as in the quarter-final a year ago, when Murray looked like he was going to lay an egg against Fernando Verdasco of Spain. He rescued himself from a poor start then but against this calibre of grass-court player, with the confidence of the recent Queen’s Club title behind him, that was never likely.

Perhaps we overestimated  Murray’s chances based on his first four matches and discounted too much the struggles of the past 12 months. What maybe hurt him most is not having banked any top 10 wins since beating Novak Djokovic here last year. The belief such victories bring was lacking at the first sign of a difficult challenge.

What happened was actually part of a pattern of lame Grand Slam defeats for Murray.

In the past four he has played well and then bombed without warning. Those defeats came against Stan Wawrinka at the US Open, Roger Federer in Australia, Rafael Nadal in Paris and now Dimitrov.

Losing to any of them is no disgrace, but there has been a concerning element of acceptance each time.

There will be some collateral damage from this hammering when it comes to Wimbledon.

Murray had built up an aura about himself at the All England Club, having won 23 of his past 24 matches here from 2012, the one defeat being an honourable loss to Federer. That aura has been well and truly blown away.

Small wonder that he spoke afterwards, encouragingly, about going away and working on much-needed improvements to his game. Deep into his career at 27 that is not going to be easy, but it is possible.

Down and out: Murray was beaten in straight sets by Dimitrov

Beaten man: Murray had no answers to Dimitov's precision

Maybe next year: Murray missed the chance to make his third successive Wimbledon final

Murray would not be specific but one area is bound to be his second serve, which finally met someone capable of punishing it. You are simply not going to beat anyone of the highest calibre when winning only 31 per cent of the points after your first serve misses out.

The expectation was that the quality of Murray’s return would  give him an edge but that was turned on its head, with Dimitrov  even sharper in this respect.

The Bulgarian’s superiority when it came to trading backhands was also unexpected. This is the stroke that has looked most improved by Murray’s back surgery, but Dimitrov’s glorious, flowing, one-handed version proved the more reliable.

The champion started well enough in creating a break point in the first game but then whacking his  forehand into the net was to prove expensive, as it immediately  settled the nerves of the younger man.

Barely 20 minutes later Murray, who thereafter made the error of just waiting for mistakes that never came, was looking at his worst Wimbledon set since losing to David Nalbandian as an 18-year-old in 2005.

Not at his best: Murray was swept aside in just over two hours by Dimitov

His best chance of turning the match around came after being broken for 3-4 in the second when Dimitrov, with girlfriend Maria Sharapova nowhere to be seen, went through his only wobble of the match.

Murray broke back and then got to 30-30 at 5-5 but could go no further. Two break points needed to be saved in his next game and then came the tiebreak, which was evenhanded until 4-4.

That was when Dimitrov showed why he is ready to win this title. The next three points were magnificently executed under steam- hammer pressure, a ripped backhand pass followed by two well-judged forays to the net where he showed his volleying skills.

A desultory double fault handed Dimitrov the break at 2-3 in the third and Murray never even made the Bulgarian sweat after that.

A curiously flat performance leaves Murray with a reduced  ranking, no titles and certainly no statue at the All England Club.  Perhaps this will be the easiest place from which to rebuild.

No answer: Murray could not reproduce the form he had earlier in the tournament

Andy Murray lost the first set 6-1 in just 25 minutes as his run of 18 straight sets won at Wimbledon came to a tame end. It was his worst set since he lost the decider 6-1 to David Nalbandian during his Wimbledon debut in 2005. It helped Grigor Dimitrov to settle quickly in what was the biggest match of his career.

The 2013 champion won just 31 per cent of second-serve points, while Dimitrov won 59 per cent. Murray’s second serve speed averaged just 86mph, 10mph less than Dimitrov.

The Scot hit 12 unforced errors and only one winner with his normally reliable backhand. The poor side-spin slice he hit long to go a break down in the second set summed up his woes from that side.

32 - Dimitrov hit 32 winners on his way to victory, eight more than Murray.

5 - Murray hit five double faults, three of them coming in the third set.

This defeat marks only the second time Murray has lost to a lower-ranked opponent at Wimbledon.

He lost to then world No 6 Andy Roddick in the 2009 semi-finals. Dimitrov will now overtake Murray, who will slip to world No 10 or 11 when Monday’s new list is issued, his worst position since June 2008. Murray has still failed to beat a  top-10 player since his  victory over Novak Djokovic here 12 months ago.
