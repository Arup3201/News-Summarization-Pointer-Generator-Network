Central Park is one of the first stops for tourists visiting New York City, but in the not-so-distant future out-of-towners will need flash if they want to take pictures of the Carousel.

Once a series of seven super-slim luxury high-rises are built, the southern quarter of the park will be largely covered in shadows according to a new study conducted by the Municipal Art Society (MAS). 

Every December 21, on the winter solstice, the park will hit its darkest point, with shadows extending 20 blocks into the park - reaching the Lake and Ramble.

A blanket of darkness: When seven luxury high-rise buildings are completed, the southern quarter of Central Park will be obscured by shadows

A look into the future: A new report by the Municipal Arts Society shows how seven new skyscrapers will impact light in the park. The above rendering shows what shadows will be case on the equinox

'It will basically plunge the park into a solar eclipse in the middle of the day,' Layla Law-Gisiko, chair of the Landmarks Committee for Community Board 5, told CBS New York.

Sheep Meadow, the large field where New Yorkers spend nice days soaking in the sun, will be obscured and useless for tanning every equinox.

While Central Park was created as a public place for rich and poor to enjoy, the buildings in question are being marketed at Russian oligarchs and Chinese tycoons who want apartments with Central Park views (Skyscraper Museum Director Carol Willis  calls these views the 'money shot').

Worst case scenario: On the shortest day of the year, shadows in the park will be as long as 20 blocks - reaching the Lake and Ramble

Seeing the shadow: On the equinox, the new skyscrapers will cast shadows to reach a dozen blocks into the park

The under-construction One57 is one of the buildings in this so-called 'Billionaire's Belt' and two of its penthouses sold for a reported $90million each.

While outgoing Mayor Michael Bloomberg has argued that it's in the city's interest to attract wealthy foreigners to live here, most of them buy up New York apartments as second-homes, and therefore avoid having to pay the city's income tax.

Another problem is that most of these buildings are being constructed 'as of right' meaning they don't need to undergo an environmental assessment or public review.

And these buildings will be some of the tallest in the Western Hemisphere.

The Nordstrom Tower will be 1,424 feet tall, which is higher than the top floor of 1 World Trade Center and the proposed 1,350 foot 111 West 57th Street building will be higher than the Empire State Building's observation deck.

These buildings are able to reach such heights because they've bought up the air rights from their surrounding buildings.

Only for the wealthiest: One57 is expected to be one of the tallest high-rise apartments in the world. Two of their penthouses recently sold for $90million each

Advances in skyscraper engineering mean these buildings can be constructed super slim - about two townhouses wide in some cases - occupying plots of land originally suited for 40-story buildings.

In their report, the Municipal Art Society proposes a re-appraisal of zoning codes to ensure that there's more oversight and public involvement in making this new breed of skyscrapers.

'It's troubling that the sky's the limit when it comes to one of our most precious public spaces,' MAS President Vin Cipolla told the New York Daily News. 'We need to protect these spaces.'

Tunnel vision: 57th Street itself will be significantly darkened with these new constructions

Pushing the boundaries: The buildings under development will be some of the tallest in the Western Hemisphere - not to mention the New York skyline

The new breed of skyscraper: Innovation in 
skyscraper engineering means these new buildings can be super-slim and 
occupy lots that are just two townhouses wide in some cases
