Cruise holidays are becoming more popular than ever and companies hve an ingenious way of squeezing in extra passengers.

Instead of building new ships, at huge cost, cruise lines such as MSC are simply cutting their ships in half and adding extra sections, before 'sewing' them back up again. 

These incredible photographs show how the MSC Sinfonia is taken apart almost like Lego, and a new section is fitted in the middle at the Fincantieri shipyard in Palermo, Sicily.

MSC Cruises has begun work to transform the second of its four Lirica-class ships with the arrival of MSC Sinfonia

To increase the size of the ship, it is literally cut in half and a new extension is added to the centre, as these photographs show

The works will continue into the night to ensure the ship is 'sewn' back together in a 10-week time frame

A look at each section might confuse the onlooker as to what is being constructed, but the finished article will be sure to impress. 

The work to lengthening and refit the vessel  will now include the addition of dedicated kids' club areas sponsored by - rather fittingly - Lego and Chicco.

The huge project is only expected to take 10 weeks in total, extending the ship in time for trials before it starts carrying passengers again in November.

The £150 million (€200 million) 'Renaissance project' is part of a huge scale upgrade to the fleet - adding 79ft midsections to four different ships. 

Fincantieri's world-class marine engineers have carefully bisected MSC Sinfonia's hull, after which the two halves of the ships were slowly drawn apart.

MSC Cruises will refit and renew much of the ship's interior, bringing an enhanced sense of comfort and space

The ship's MSC Aurea Spa will also be enriched with additional massage areas, and a new outdoor spray park will be added on deck 13

This week they will insert a 2,200GT, 79ft midsection containing 193 extra cabins. Then they will refit and renew much of the ship's interior, bringing an enhanced sense of comfort and space.

Before MSC Sinfonia's arrival, Fincantieri's preparations were already well under way for the work on board and in the shipyard. On January 9, the new midsection was floated into the shipyard and hauled into the dry-dock area where MSC Sinfonia will remain for the duration of its stay.

Once the work is complete and sea trials completed, the larger, smarter MSC Sinfonia will weigh anchor from the shipyard on March 25 for Genoa, from where it will begin for a maiden cruise to Ajaccio, Barcelona and Marseille.

These photographs show how quite literally the ship is split in two to prepare for the new section that will mean more passengers paying on

MSC Cruises executive director UK and Ireland Giles Hawke said: 'Everyone at MSC Cruises loves our partnerships with LEGO and Chicco – they are two fantastic internationally-renowned brands. It is great news that we are giving families even more opportunity to enjoy these facilities by adding them to MSC Sinfonia.' 

MSC Cruises currently carries roughly 40,000 guests per day, but by 2022 will double its capacity to 80,000 guests a day – 3.4 million per year – once the Renaissance Programme is completed and the last of seven planned ships is delivered.
