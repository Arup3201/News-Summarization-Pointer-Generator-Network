Nevada drivers could soon be sharing the road with vehicles that don't need them.

Department of Motor Vehicles officials said Monday they've issued Google the nation's first license to test self-driving cars on public streets, after conducting demonstrations on the Las Vegas Strip and in Carson City that show the car is as safe - or perhaps safer - than a human.

For one thing, the engineers programed the car to create a ‘virtual buffer zone’ around obstacles, making it more aware than some drivers to boot.

All the (road) rage: Nevada's DMV issued Google a licence allowing the world's first driverless car to drive on public streets

Motorised view: This is what a driverless car sees now that Google's Prius is allowed to roam the streets

'It gets honked at more often because it's being safe,' Nevada DMV Director Bruce Breslow told the AP.

Self-driving vehicle technology works like auto-pilot to guide a car - in this case a modified Prius - with little or no intervention from a human operator.

 Laser radar mounted on the roof and in the grill detects pedestrians, cyclists and other vehicles, creating a virtual buffer zone around the obstacles that the car then avoids.

While some envision the robotic car dropping off its operator at the front of the mall and hunting for a parking spot on its own, Mr Breslow said not so fast.

Nevada's regulations require two people in the test cars at all times.

A user, who is legally blind, sat behind the wheel during a recent test drive and showed off to the passengers that no hands were needed To date, Google's cars have gone about 700,000 miles (1.1 million km) in self-driving mode

One person is behind the wheel, while the other person monitors a computer screen that shows the car's planned route and keeps tabs on roadway hazards and traffic lights.

If there's a glitch, the human driver can override the autonomous auto with a tap on the brake or a hand on the steering wheel.

Last summer, Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval took the car for a spin in and around the state's quiet capital city. 

But Las Vegas Boulevard, where costumed superheroes routinely take the crosswalks and massive billboards angle for the attention of starry-eyed tourists, was perhaps best suited to test the car's main purpose.

'They're designed to avoid distracted driving,' Mr Breslow said. 'When you're on the Strip and there's a huge truck with a three scantily clad women on the side, the car only sees a box.'

So far, Google's applied to license three test vehicles. Mr Breslow said the cars will display red plates and an infinity symbol to represent their status as vehicles of the future.

Once they're ready for the market - something Mr Breslow guesses could come in three to five years - the plates will be green.
