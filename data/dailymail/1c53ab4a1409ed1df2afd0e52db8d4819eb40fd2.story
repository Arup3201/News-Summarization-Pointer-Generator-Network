The man charged with kidnapping 15-year-old Abby Hernandez nine months ago is very bright, has strong opinions and thrives on conflict, according to a police officer who had two decades of contact with him.

Former Conway Lt Chris Perley, who left the force in April after 29 years, has known 34-year-old Nathaniel Kibby since the kidnapping suspect was 12 years old and was surprised to hear of his arrest.

Kibby was arrested at his Gorham trailer Monday and charged with kidnapping Hernandez on October 9, a week before her 15th birthday. Abby returned home July 20, but investigators have been tight-lipped about the details surrounding her disappearance and return.

'Smart, but myopic': Retired Conway, New Hampshire police officer Chris Perley (pictured) has spoken out about his two decades interacting with Abby Hernandez's alleged kidnapper, Nathaniel Kibby

Snatched: Kibby, 34 (left), was arraigned in court last week on charges of kidnapping 15-year-old Abigail Hernandez (right) last October. Abby surprisingly reappeared alive in her hometown of Conway on July 20, nine months after going missing. She attended last week's court hearing and sat in the front row

Perley said his most recent dealing with Kibby was over a summons for running a red light.

'He thought he should be entitled to (run the light) because he went to work at such early hours,' Perley said.

'He was smart, but he was also brutally myopic in whatever view he had,' Perley said. 'You could not shake him or redirect him in the way he saw the world.'

Kibby has a lengthy criminal record, including several assaults. Particularly disturbing, Perley said, was an arrest in March when Kibby was charged with criminal trespass and assault after following a Conway woman to her home after a minor car accident. Police said he pushed her to the ground in her driveway after she ordered him to stop taking pictures of her car.

'I remember thinking that was so over the top,' Perley said. 'You don't go to their home and get into a chest-bumping situation, especially with a woman.'

Another victim: Tammy Shackford told MailOnline about her terrifying encounter with Kibby in March, when he shoved her to the ground multiple times over a car accident

The victim of the assault, 55-year-old Tammy Shackford, spoke with MailOnline about the vicious attack that left her with nightmares and shock.

Shackford said that she caught Kibby rifling through her damaged truck In March, following weeks of arguments over how much damage he caused in the accident.

She says he marched up to her and pushed her to the ground, injuring her elbow. When she got up, he shoved her down again.

‘I was incredibly scared. He has serious issues. I could see it in his eyes, he was crazy,  something really wasn’t right,' she said.

The mother-of-one managed to call police and Kibby was found hiding in a neighbor’s garden and arrested.

The assault charge was eventually dropped, and Kibby pleaded guilty to criminal trespass on July 23 at Conway Circuit Court - three days after Abby returned home.

Kibby grew up in and attended school in Conway, a tourist-dependent town of about 1,800 people in the southeast corner of the White Mountain National Forest.

Although he'd lived in Gorham for a while, he returned to Conway to work as a machinist at two gun makers - Green Mountain Rifle Barrel Co. and E.M.M. Precision. Various news outlets have reported he was laid off this year for economic reasons.

Kibby was arraigned Tuesday and is being held on $1million cash bond. He's due in court August 12. His public defender, Jesse Friedman, did not return a call seeking comment.

Prosecutors have revealed little of what they have learned since Kibby's arrest, saying only that investigators continue to search his home and the surrounding grounds.

It remains unclear where Abby was held for more than nine months. She attended Tuesday's brief hearing, wide-eyed but otherwise expressionless, and made no comments.

On Thursday, Abby stopped by the offices of the Conway Daily Sun, the newspaper that ran a daily box counting the number of days she had been missing and urging people to call police with any information. Abby's mother, Zenya, told the paper her daughter occasionally saw the box while she was in captivity, and it gave her hope.

Daily Sun reporter Daymond Steer said Abby and her mother seemed relaxed during the visit.

'They seemed like they were on the mend,' Steer said. 'They've been through a lot obviously, but she's getting better.'

On Friday, it was revealed that police may have missed an opportunity to rescue Abby five months after her disappearance, when they showed up at Kibby's mobile home to collect his vast arsenal of weapons following the assault arrest.

Kibby actually called police and invited them to his home to collect the weapons so he would not be in breach of his bail conditions.

Official records show two officers went round to his property at 9:04pm on March 2013, stayed for fifteen minutes and then left with his guns.

What did they find? Investigators at Kibby's property were photographed on Thursday storing evidence in boxes marked 'biohazard'

Their visit raises serious questions as it is believed Abby was held on his tiny property for the entire nine months since her October disappearance.

Court documents show Kibby has convictions on four trespassing counts, simple assault, providing false information to obtain a firearm and two counts each of receiving stolen property and resisting arrest.

He faces up to seven years in prison if convicted of kidnapping. But Perley said nothing foreshadowed the kidnapping allegations.

'You're always hoping it's some stranger and that evil doesn't live in your midst,' Perley said. 'Certainly nothing he'd ever done would lead you to believe this is what he would do. If it is true, the depravity of the man knows no limits.'
