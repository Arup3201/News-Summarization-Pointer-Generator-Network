These pain-crazed thrill seekers are hooked on bungee jumping in more ways than one, leaping off platforms 250 feet high with their harnesses attached to piercings on their backs.

The dare-devils, who call themselves The Sinner Team, filmed themselves performing a series of mind-boggling bungee jumps and base jumps in Konakovo, Russia.

They are first seen preparing for their jumps by piercing their backs with four small metal bars to create a rigging to which their bungee cords are attached.

Rigging: The harnesses are attached to four heavy-duty skin piercings

They then leap off the platform and record the look of sheer pain etched on their faces when the chute tugs at their skin, using a camera attached to a pole.

The Moscow-based team was founded by Stanislav Aksenov and his wife Elena in 2008, and have been developing their extreme stunts ever since.

The act of hanging oneself by body piercings, known as suspension, has been bizzarely growing in popularity since the 70s and 80s.

The piercings are normally temporary and are traditionally performed just before the suspension.

The practise was first recorded in the 1800s among members of the Mandam tribe of North American Indians who lived along the banks of the Missouri River.

But the extreme Sinner Team have been taking the Suspensions to the next level by combining them with extreme sports.

They have also been filmed performing bungee jump suspensions into a giant disused cooling tower.

Needless to say, do not try this at home.
