A councillor kicked out of Ukip has insisted she is not racist despite being filmed saying she has 'a problem with people with negroid features'.

Rozanne Duncan, who was a member of Ukip in the seat where Nigel Farage will run to be an MP, said she did not like 'negroes'.

Ms Duncan was expelled from the party after the comments were revealed by the makers of a fly-on-the-wall documentary by the BBC, but she still says she does not regret her comments.

Rozanne Duncan says she is not racist despite being filmed saying she has 'a problem with people with negroid features'

The councillor for Thanet South, in Kent, was filmed telling Ukip press officer Liz Langton Way that she has 'problems with negroes'.

'I have to watch my tongue because I can be very outspoken and it goes against the grain to be careful what I'm saying,' Ms Duncan said.

Insisting there was 'absolutely no way I'm a racist', she added: 'The only people I do have problems with are negroes. And I don't know why.

'I don't know whether there is something in my psyche or whether it's karma from a previous life or whether something happened to me as a very, very young person and I've drawn a veil over it - because that sometimes happens, doesn't it?

'But I really do have a problem with people with negroid features.'

Ms Duncan went on to explain that things were different when she was brought up. 

She said: 'I used to say to my daughter, by way of some sort of justification, you need to remember that I was born in the late '40s, early '50s when, especially down in Thanet, there weren't any and I wasn't brought up with them. Now that's no justification at all, it doesn't answer the question "why is she like that with them and not anybody else."' 

Her comments were revealed in BBC documentary Meet the Ukippers, which airs tonight.

After Ukip booted her out of the party over the comments, Ms Duncan claimed there had been a 'hidden agenda' against her and she felt 'betrayed'.

'I still honestly believe that what I said was never at any time racist or derogatory,' she said.

'I used the word "negroes" as you would do Asians, Chinese, Muslims, Jews. It's a description, it's not an insult - in the same way as you would say "what do you mean by Jewish?" Well, they belong to a community, they have got a certain faith, they have usually got noses that have got a bit of a curve to them, married women - if they are orthodox Jews - wear wigs. It's description.'

She added: 'I don't regret saying it. I don't regret anything, that's the truth.

‘I was not expelled for having an "association with or membership of an organisation incompatible with membership of the party", nor have I links with a far-right or any other group.

‘The only group I’ve ever belonged to is the Conservative party — unless you count Mensa, the Women’s Institute or the Order of Women Freemasons.’

Ukip local chairman Martyn Heale is shown discussing his past membership of the far-right National Front

The documentary also shows local Ukip chairman Martyn Heale attempting to draw a line under his past membership of the far-right National Front.

He said: 'For Christ's sake, I was never a member of the Gestapo. I was not a member of the Stasi, I never served a term of imprisonment in my life.

Ms Duncan was elected as a Ukip councillor in a by-election in the Cliftonville East ward of Thanet South in May 2013 with a 41 per cent share of the vote.

The landlady, who owned four properties in Margate when she was elected, was brought up in Kent.

She stood in a council election for the Margate Central ward in 2007 for the Conservative party, but was not elected after finishing third with 192 votes.

After she was expelled from Ukip, she continued in her role as an independent. 

'I was a f***ing member of the Conservative Party for 22 years, I was a member of the National Front for one year and two months. Why don't they just let it go?'

He added that when he joined, he did not realised the organisation was 'as extreme as they said'. 

The controversy is just the latest row over racism to hit Ukip. In December, Mr Farage defended a disgraced Ukip candidate taped referring to a Chinese woman as a ‘Chinky bird’.

The Ukip leader said he felt sorry for Kerry Smith, who was a ‘rough diamond’ and meant no ‘malice’ with the comments, which were not considered offensive in TV shows like Only Fools and Horses.

Mr Farage hit back at claims it was not further proof that Ukip is racist and homophobic, claiming people who live in London are ‘snobbish’ about ‘colloquial language’ which is common amongst people who live in council houses.

He initially refused to sack Mr Smith, with Ukip insiders hoping an apology would help the row to ‘blow over’. Eventually he stood down ‘by mutual consent’.
