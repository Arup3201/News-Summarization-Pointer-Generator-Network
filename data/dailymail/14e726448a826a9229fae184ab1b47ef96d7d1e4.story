Senator Nova Peris has denied using taxpayer money to facilitate an extra-marital affair with Trinidad and Tobago sprinter Ato Boldon during an address to the Federal Senate.

The former athlete defended herself against the charge following the publication of a string of emails by NT News which also revealed she was allegedly having a sexual relationship with Boldon in 2010.

The exchanges - which Ms Peris said she could not authenticate because she did not have them to hand - which also included derogatory remarks about her friend and fellow Olympian Cathy Freeman.

During her address to the Upper House in Canberra on Thursday, Senator Peris said the emails were leaked as part of a long-running family dispute.

Northern Territory senator Nova Peris has denied she misused public funds to carry out an affair

Australia's first female indigenous senator fought back tears as she told her colleagues that the accusations about her misusing taxpayer funds were 'baseless'.

'I categorically object to any wrong doing,' Senator Peris said.

Senator Peris said she was never responsible for the money used to bring Boldon over for an athletics program. 

'Athletics Australia has confirmed that my role was establishing initial contact with Mr Boldon,' she said.

Senator Peris added Australian Sports Commission had confirmed Athletics Australia had 'fully acquitted the funds provided, including independent auditor confirmation, that they were spent for the purposes they were provided'.

In the email exchanges, it is also claimed Ms Peris compared her alleged sexual relations with Boldon as being 'just like a tim-tam… black on black' and boasting that 'white men can't control black women'. 

Through tears, Ms Peris said the emails were meant to 'embarrass me and my family'

Senator Peris said she did not have a copy of the emails and could not comment on their 'thoracity'.

'What I can say is that views attributed to me based on selected words... in private emails certainly don't reflect my views, my values and the evidence of this is the life I have continued to lead,' she said.

In her address, Senator Peris said she was told in 2010 via a representative that an 'aggrieved party' who was in possession of the leaked emails was prepared to take action that would 'only result in trauma for everyone, especially the children, and damage the reputation of some stakeholders'.

She was contacted again on October 9 this year and read the correspondence between them to the senate.

'The first line read: "I am sending this communication to you today to ensure there is no mistake as to who is responsible for releasing the information in relation to you",' Senator Peris recited.

Senator Peris said the NT News was aware the emails were part of the family dispute when they published the emails. 

'The release and publication of these emails [was an] attempt to extract money from me, and embarrass me and my family,' she said.

The emails contained derogatory comments about Cathy Freeman and emerged less than a fortnight after they were photographed smiling and embracing at a function in Melbourne on October 17

The senator said she had also talked to former Olympian Cathy Freeman about the emails. 

One of the emails described the Australian gold medallist as 'so so dumb' who had 'zero communication skills'.

After speaking with Freeman, Senator Peris told the senate: 'Our friendship remains strong and we will continue to support each other.'

The emergence of the emails came less than a fortnight after they were photographed smiling and embracing at a function in Melbourne on October 17, which was posted on the senator's Facebook page and on the official Cathy Freeman Foundation. 

On Thursday, Senator Peris said she remained proud of who she was and would continue to protect her children - describing them as her 'universe'.

'Despite the hopes of some, this incident will not stop me from serving the people of the Northern Territory and advocating on behalf of Aboriginal Australians,' she said. 

Senator Peris said she had been overwhelmed by the support she had received from the public and colleagues on both sides of politics during the past couple of days.

After her statement to the senate, Labor senators comforted her.
