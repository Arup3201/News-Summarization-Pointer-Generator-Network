Exposed midriffs made a big comeback this year, with celebrities such as Ellie Goulding and Rita Ora regularly showing off their toned stomachs at awards ceremonies, music videos, nights out and regular ‘selfies’ on Twitter and Instagram.

But as a result doctors say increasing numbers of young women are seeking treatment to remove thread veins from this newly exposed area.

Experts at Dr Newmans Clinic, a network of thread vein removal clinics based across the UK, have reported a 20 per cent increase in women undergoing treatment on thread veins in the ‘subcostal margin’ – the area between the edges of the ribs, down to the soft abdomen.

Thread veins are often associated with heavy drinking, but experts say they can be caused by a myriad of factors, including too much sun, hormones and pregnancy, a genetic predisposition or an underlying skin condition such as rosacea.

Women often have a genetic predisposition to suffering from thread veins on their midriffs, doctors say. 

Patients are usually very fair skinned and redheads are even more likely to have them.

Dr Peter Finigan, medical director at Dr Newmans Clinic said demand for vein removal from the midriff area has soared this year.

He said: ‘Whereas the top two most common areas women have thread veins treated are on their faces and legs, recently we have seen a sharp rise in the number of 20-40 year old women coming in with concerns about thread veins in the subcostal margin, and this area is now the third most common part of the body for treatment.’

‘Many patients tell us they feel self-conscious wearing a bikini or crop top if they have thread veins in this area – which usually appear in a ‘belt’ of tiny, vertical red lines.’

Other celebrities who are fans of the exposed midriff include Emma Watson, Cheryl Cole, Cara Delevingne, and Abbey Clancy, who just weeks ago posted a ‘selfie’ of herself in her Calvin Klein underwear and boasted a picture perfect midriff. 

The women seeking treatment are becoming increasingly younger than their usual clientele, Dr Finigan added.

He said: ‘Interestingly, the patients we have treated for this area over the last 12 months have been getting younger, with the majority aged between 20 and 30-year-old.’

He continued: 'We do also treat older women up to the age of 40, but patient numbers tend to fall after this age. 

'This could be down to older women preferring not to bare their midriff, or perhaps becoming more body confident as they get older.'
