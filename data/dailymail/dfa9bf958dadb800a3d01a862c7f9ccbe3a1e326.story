Middlesbrough midfielder Adam Clayton will do everything in his power to knock Manchester City out of the FA Cup on Saturday, regardless of how his mum feels about it.

Clayton grew up supporting the Premier League champions and revealed his family also have strong ties with the club.

But when the Aitor Karanka's side travel to the Etihad Stadium for their fourth round clash Clayton knows where his loyalties will lie.

'My mum is a massive, massive City fan,' said Clayton. 'I come from a Manchester mixed marriage - my dad's a red, but my mum's a big, big City fan.

'I grew up as a City fan too, but you have to put all that aside and I'll be hoping to go there and get a result for Boro. 

'The house I grew up in was 10 minutes from Maine Road and it's no secret I grew up supporting them.

'I signed for City quite early. I was only seven years old when I joined the academy so my allegiance went that way, much to my dad's disappointment. I went to watch them every week. I think I went eight or nine years without missing a single home game.'
