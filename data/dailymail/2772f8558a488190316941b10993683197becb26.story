A group of schoolboys were caught by police after they were pictured surfing on the back of a bus while wearing rollerskates.

The five youngsters, all aged between 12 and 15, were stopped by officers after a shocked bystander took a picture of them hanging on to the back of the bus as it drove up a hill in Dudley, West Midlands.

But instead of charging them after they admitted being carried or towed by a motor vehicle, officers thought of a more productive punishment - they made them clean up the local us depot.

Dangerous: A group of five youngsters were spotted hitching a ride on the back of a bus on rollerskates

PC Reg Steele, from West Midlands Police, said: 'As this was a minor traffic offence it could have been dealt with in two ways, either through the courts where a fine could have been processed or a community resolution.

'We agreed with National Express West Midlands that a community resolution would be the best solution and would give the youngsters time to think about their reckless actions.

As well as cleaning up the depot, the group will also have to clean National Express's fleet of West Midlands buses.

Raj Mishra, National Express West Midlands Operations Manager said: 'We hope that by the youngsters working with us to clean our vehicles and spending time on site with us, it will help them understand the dangers of using vehicles to tow them along.'

Police guidance suggests officers should use them only for low level offences in which no-one is hurt, or for anti-social behaviour.

Punishment: The youngsters, who were filmed by a shocked passer by, were made to clean up a local bus depot and its buses by police

Earlier this year, a schoolboy nicknamed 'the Titch-hiker' was named and shamed by his parents and handed over to police after video footage emerged of him hitching a lift home on the tailbar of a 40-tonne lorry.

Sonny Wilson, 12, was captured on film sitting on the back of the truck as it drove through Blackburn, Lancashire.

His father David Wilson and mother Karen Brian both saw the footage on Facebook and called the police.

Eventually when the TNT delivery lorry slowed down at traffic lights the boy jumped off and gave the occupants of the car behind, who were filming him, a cheeky thumbs up before walking off down the street.
