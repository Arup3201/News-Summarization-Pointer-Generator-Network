All parents dream of children who help with the washing up and tidy their bedrooms without being asked.

But Lesley Turner, 56, from Bridgend, Wales, admits she has taken her obsession with cleaning too far, unwittingly passing her Obsessive Compulsive Disorder onto daughter Tuesday, 23.

The mother and daughter spend every waking hour at home hoovering, dusting, bleaching and steaming every surface.

And they are both so frightened of catching germs and of dirt that they don't even kiss or hug.

But the pair are determined to get help before it's too late.

'My mum was always very strict when I was little about tidying,' says Tuesday.

'For example, when I brushed my hair, I had to do it in a certain spot in the kitchen and hoover the floor straight afterwards.

'The house has always been very minimal. My bedroom has always been immaculate - no creases on my bed covers, even,' she says.

'I can't even say when I started making my own bed or cleaning. It's just always been normal to me as that's the way I was brought up and I didn't know any different. By the time I went to school, I was dusting and wiping the surfaces and even using bleach in the toilet or in the kitchen. I enjoyed it. I got a real sense of satisfaction at the end of it.'

Her mother Lesley rarely leaves the house at all and although Tuesday is a student who goes to university every day, studying Public and Emergency Services, the OCD is starting to have an effect on her life, too.

'It is very debilitating,' says Tuesday.

'I absolutely hate going to university. I'm a germaphobe, so I won't touch the university computers or go to the canteen. I sit right on the edge of the seat at the lecture so there's as little contact between me and the dirty seat as possible.

'I don't like to be touched. I don't even like people breathing near me. As for coughing and sneezing - I can't bear it. I go out of my way to avoid contamination.

'I carry anti-bacterial gel and wipes with me so that I don't have to touch door handles or cashpoint machines.

'I want to go travelling after my studies and then get a job, but at the moment there's no way I could do it. The OCD controls me too much.

'My mum and I don't hug or kiss either. I
know people might think that's odd, but we do say, "I love you" to each
other so it's just a different way of expressing our feelings.'

Whenever Tuesday is at home with her mother they clean. Whether it be steaming floors, bleaching surfaces, or dusting from top to bottom.

'She does feel guilty about it, but I don't blame her,' says Tuesday.

'Her influence on me has been totally unconscious. She did inflict this condition on me, but she didn't realise she was doing it. I do have my own mind, and she didn't make me turn out like this.'

The pair star in Channel 4's Obsessive Compulsive Cleaners, where they talk about their condition
and go and clean someone else's house who has the opposite problem to them - hoarding.

'We're both getting help now. The show helped us realise how extreme we have become, and that we need to tackle this. I'm having therapy, and Mum's seeing a psychiatrist. I hope we can both get it under control.'

'I have had OCD all my life, although I have only just been diagnosed officially. I've honestly never thought it was a problem before. It's just the way I am,' says Lesley.

'My mum brought three kids up on her own and the house was always clean. We kept the house nice and made our own beds and dusted our rooms before school, and that was the way until I left home aged 15.

'When I got my own house, I carried on tidying and cleaning every day, and I got worse as I got older.In my 20s I had various jobs, like working in a factory, being a cake decorator, a housekeeper, bar work. I would clean the house before work and when I got home.

'When I was 33, I had Tuesday as a single parent. She was the shiniest, cleanest baby you ever saw, wiped to within an inch of her life. I changed her nappy far often than it needed. She barely had a chance to get it dirty before I'd put a clean one on. If she was sick, I'd change her outfit straight away and put it straight in the machine.

'Tuesday helps me. I have sciatica and osteoarthritis, so I find it hard to hoover, so Tuesday does that while I do the feather dusting.

'I don't think I'm going to die if I don't turn the lights on and off ten times, I'm not like that. I just get angry and upset, and I can't stop until it's done. I get furious and think, "How dare that speck of dirt be inside my house after all the dusting I've done?"

'If I'm lucky, I may get to watch half an hour of TV in the evening. But if I see some dirt while I'm sitting down, I have to get up and start all over again.'

'It's very rare that we allow someone else in the house,' says Lesley.

'We allowed the cameraman in the house but he had to wear bags on his shoes, and not touch anything, and we made him use the pub's toilets instead of our own.

But doing the show has made me realise I need to get help. And I do feel for Tuesday. It's not that I encourage her OCD, but I just understand it.

I do realise it's totally my fault that she is that way. I feel so guilty, and so sorry for her. I don't want her to be like me and be controlled by this. I want her to go and have fun.

I think we can get better. I have already drunk from a coffee mug without holding a tissue around the handle, which is progress for me. 

Obsessive Compulsive Cleaners starts tonight at 8pm on Channel 4.
