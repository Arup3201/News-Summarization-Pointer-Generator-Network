Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah has hinted that they are ready to support President Assad in the Syria war

The leader of Hezbollah has hinted he is ready support the Assad regime in the Syrian war.

Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the powerful Lebanese Shiite militia, warned on Tuesday during a rare interview that Syria had 'real friends' who 
would not allow it 'to fall into the hands' of America, Israel and even 
Islamic extremists.

His comments came after U.S. President Barack Obama that he was ready to up the game in Syria, following reports of chemical weapons allegedly used by Syrian president Bashar al-Assad fighters.

Hezbollah has previously only sent small groups of fighters for battles with other Lebanese groups fighting in Syria but seems to have been provoked by Obama's comments into a stronger stance.

The Washington Post on Tuesday reported senior officials describing Obama as ready to move on what one described as the 'left-hand side' of a broad spectrum that ranged from 'arming the opposition to boots on the ground.'

Consequently, the Syria regime has got the support that it needs from Hezbollah, an impressive Lebanese military group which proved its capability when it defeated highly equipped Israeli army soldiers who invaded Lebanon briefly in the summer of 2006.

On Tuesday the Hezbollah leader openly acknowledged for the first time that its fighters were battling rebels in neighbouring Syria, an intervention that is already threatening to drag Lebanon deeper into that conflict.

Nasrallah appeared to be referring to Iran, a patron of both Hezbollah and the Syrian government, as well as Hezbollah itself, which has relied entirely in the past on Iran and Syria to supply its arms.

'You won’t be able to bring down Damascus and you cannot bring down the regime, militarily,' Nasrallah said. 'The battle will be long.'

Yet it’s more Hezbollah’s link with Iran which is believed to be a decisive move to up the stakes with Washington.

His comments came after President Barack Obama strongly suggested he would consider military action against Syria if it can be confirmed that President Bashar Assad's government used chemical weapons

Iran has nuclear weapons as well as the ability to produce chemical weapons.

Also, if the Syrian regime needs to move some of its chemical weapons quickly, the only destination can be Hezbollah held areas of Lebanon.

Alternatively, those same weapons could be moved within Syria and guarded by Hezbollah fighters, considered to be highly disciplined and far superior to their Syrian Army comrades.

This week President Obama is reported to be trying to rally support from international supporters of his plans to oust Assad with a much more decisive role in arming the rebels with much heavier and lethal firepower.

British foreign secretary William Hague is also currently battling with EU foreign ministers in Europe to try and lift the current EU arms embargo on the Syrian rebels.

U.S. media reported that President Obama is preparing to send lethal weaponry to the Syrian opposition and has taken steps to 'assert more aggressive U.S. leadership among allies and partners' in seeking to oust Assad.

Until now, Hezbollah has only made subdued public statements on the Syria situation to avoid further inflaming tensions within Lebanon.

But after the Hezbollah-led government was dissolved last month, Nasrallah is reported by many pundits to have calculated that an all-out push to save Hezbollah’s ally, Mr. Assad, is worth the political trade-off in the long run.

It would not be the first time that Hezbollah has used a war to increase its political support ahead of key elections.

In 2006, it virtually got a 100 per cent backing from the entire Shia community in Lebanon after giving the Israelis a bloody nose on the battlefields of southern Lebanon.

Lebanese leaders are struggling to form a new government, deeply divided by the Syrian conflict, despite the country’s official policy of 'disassociation' from it.

However, momentum is building in the country and this week Lebanese media reported that 'hundreds' of Sunni hard-core Islamists were lining up to join Syrian rebel fighters, after a rallying speech of a Sunni Salafist leader.

Hezbollah, meanwhile, seems to have gone back to basics and given up on the conventional rules of political horse-trading and opted for the Assad ticket.

War is after all, a more familiar ground than the awkward setting of parliament and diplomatic foibles.

But it’s also about the new Lebanese Prime Minister fighting his own battle to have the crucial ‘one third’ voting veto removed from the parliament so that a new government will not be hampered by pushing crucial reforms through, by Hezbollah blocking it.

Top of the list for reforms is addressing the issue of the arms that Hezbollah has.

Lebanon’s ‘neutrality’ though is more important than many think.

If Lebanon is dragged into the war and itself becomes a battlefield, then the Syrian war becomes a regional war, something that Obama is fighting the bitter end to prevent as he knows this will play into Assad’s hands.
