A former beauty queen is travelling from the other side of the world to re-visit the place where she took her crown 40 years ago.

Managers at Stretford Mall in Manchester launched their search for former Miss Stretford June Perfect, nee Pickering, more than a year ago, after they found glamorous photos of the beauty queen from 1973 in their offices.

After her story featured in the Manchester Evening News, they managed to track her down to her home in Cambridge, New Zealand.

Nostalgia: June was just 21 years old when she was crowned Miss Stretford in 1973, and now she will revisit the place where she was crowned 40 years ago

Now a grandmother-of-three, June will return to the shopping centre on Thursday for a nostalgic trip down memory lane.

Stretford Mall manager Colin McCrory said: 'We are so looking forward to meeting June in person and finding out her memories of Stretford Mall and her victory here.

'I am sure many of our loyal shoppers will be very interested to hear and read of June's memories of her win 40 years ago.'

June was just 21 years old when she 
was crowned Miss Stretford, and still has the sash and swimsuit she wore
for the competition.

The
61-year-old said: 'I think it is going to be lovely to spend time 
revisiting that very happy period in my life and share the memories I 
have of Stretford Mall.'
