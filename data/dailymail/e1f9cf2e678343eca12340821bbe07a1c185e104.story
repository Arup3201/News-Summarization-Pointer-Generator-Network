The families of five World War Two airmen who were shot down during a bombing raid more than 70 years ago are calling on the Government to help recover their bodies from a German swamp.

The young men of Halifax HR980 were shot down during a night raid over Berlin in 1943 and the location of their crash was thought to have been lost after the war.

Their relatives were never told where the plane landed but when the swamp they crashed into began to dry up, pieces of the aircraft were pushed to the surface and revealed their final resting place.

German authorites have now granted permission for the plane and the bodies of the five Commonwealth airmen to be recovered.

However, their requests to the governments of the UK, Canada and Australia to help fund the £165,000 recovery operation have been rejected.

One of the men who died in the raid was Canadian Flight Sergeant Jake Harrison, who left behind widow Lola Leslie,  now aged 92.

Her daughter Linda says the family don't have the heart to explain to her mother that he will not be recovered from the mud.

She said: 'They were married for two days when he got called to service and never returned home. You can imagine her reaction when I told her Jake's plane was found after all these years.

'All those years of wondering what happened to him - my heart broke for her.

'I have not told her that the recovery is at a standstill due to a lack of funding, I don't want to put her through that. She keeps asking if they found him and I just tell her it takes time.'

Mrs Leslie said the three Commonwealth countries have a duty to fund the rescue operation which has been planned by volunteer recovery specialists.

Pat Davies, 94, is the sister of trapped British navigator Sergeant Peter Buck and is desperate for him to receive a 'proper burial'.

Mrs Davies, from Eastbourne, East Sussex, said: 'I think the government should do something - they went down protecting the country and doing their duty.

'It would be a nice thing for them to finally be laid to rest in a proper burial.'

The young bomber crew were shot down on August 23, 1943, and crashed into the Reiersdorf swamp 35 miles north of Berlin.

Crash reports unearthed in the RAF archives reveal Wehrmacht soldiers recovered the bodies of Australian air gunners Flight Sergeant Harley Harber, 27, and Sergeant Arthur Cox, whose bodies were thrown free of the aircraft and later buried in the Berlin  war cemetery.

The location of the crash site sank without trace in the archives of the RAF after the war, and the families were never told of the location.

Only after the swamp began to dry up in recent years was the crash location rediscovered.

The remaining trapped crew are Australian pilot Flight Sergeant William Burgum, 21, British aircrew Sergeant Roland Hill, 32, Sergeant Peter Buck, 20, Sergeant Donald Hempstock, 21, and Canadian Flight Sergeant Gordon Harrison.

Now a team of recovery experts from the Canadian Halifax 57 Rescue organisation and a team of German aviation archaeologists from Luftfahrt Archäologie Oderland have drawn up an excavation plan.

The operation, costing £165,000, involves using 'ground freezing' refrigerated probes to create a 200ft-diameter circular wall of frozen swamp around the crash site.

Inside the frozen wall they will then pump out the thick muddy soup covering the wreckage.

Recovery co-ordinator Karl Kjarsgaard, a director of the Bomber Command Museum of Canada and president of the recovery group Halifax 57 Rescue, warned that without funding from governments or business an excavation would not be possible.

He said: 'The leaders of our governments have the funding to do this recovery but they will not provide the collaborative seed money to do the right thing.

'These air warriors who gave us our freedom lie in the mud and should not be there.'

A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said they did not fund archaeological digs of historic aircraft, but if remains were found they would pay for a burial in the local area where they were discovered.

Bomber Command crews suffered a terrifyingly high casualty rate during the war. With 55,573 killed out of a total of 125,000 aircrew between 1939 to 1945, bomber crews had a worse chance of survival than an infantry officer in the trenches of the First World War.
