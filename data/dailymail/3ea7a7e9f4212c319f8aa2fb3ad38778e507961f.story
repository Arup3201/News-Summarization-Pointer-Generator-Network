Deprived: Michael Jackson may have been the only human to go two months without sleeping properl

Michael Jackson went for 60 days without sleep, making him the only person ever to have done so, a sleep expert has claimed.

Charles Czeisler, a Harvard Medical School sleep expert, said he has never heard of any person who has gone 60 days with Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep as he testified at the wrongful death trial of concert promoter AEG LIve.

Michael Jackson's mother Katherine is suing AEG Live, claiming it failed
 to properly investigate her son's personal doctor Conrad Murray and 
missed warning signs about his failing health.

Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 2011 after giving Jackson a lethal dose of the anesthetic propofol.

Jackson's mother argues AEG Live pressured Dr. Murray to get her son to 
rehearsals but ignored warning signs and failed to get him help.

But AEG Live lawyers say Jackson chose and hired Murray so their executives had no way of knowing about the propofol treatments administered in his home.

As reported by CNN, the jury was told by Dr Czeisler that the 60 nights of propofol infusions which Dr Murray said he gave Jackson to treat insomnia has never before been undertaken.

Dr Czeisler, a sleep consultant to NASA and the CIA, told the jury that the drug does not offer REM sleep and disrupts the normal sleep cycle.

But it leaves those who take it refreshed and feeling as though they have had a proper night's sleep.

The doctor told the jury that the lack of REM sleep could eventually have taken the singer's life had he not have died when did.

The jury was told that rats tested by scientists died after five weeks of no REM sleep.

People who are deprived of REM sleep for
 long periods become depressed, paranoid and anxious. They also lose their balance and appetite, and can have slower physical and emotional reactions.

These 
are symptoms which Jackson was said to be suffering from in his final 
weeks. His show's producers reported that he became thinner, paranoid and forgetful, and was heard talking to himself.

Suffering Rapid Eye Movement sleep deprivation for an extended period of time makes someone paranoid, depressed, unable to learn, distracted, and anxious, Dr Charles Czeisler testified in the trial.

The sufferer loses their balance and appetite, while their physical reflexes get 10 times slower and their emotional responses 10 times stronger, he said.

The brain needs seven to eight hours of sleep to repair and maintain neurons every night. Learning and memory also happen when you are asleep, he said. Without it, the sufferer completes tasks less successfully, he said.

'It would be like eating some sort of cellulose pellets instead of dinner,' he said. 'Your stomach would be full and you would not be hungry, but it would be zero calories and not fulfill any of your nutrition needs.'

He explained to the jury that your brain needs seven to eight hours of sleep to repair and maintain neurons every night.

'Like a computer, the brain has to go 
offline to maintain cells that we keep for life, since we don't make 
more,' he said. 'Sleep is the repair and maintenance of the brain 
cells.'

Lawyers acting for AEG Live have said it was Jackson who chose and hired Murray. They say executives could not have known about the dangerous propofol treatments.

Expert opinion: Charles Czeisler, a Harvard Medical School sleep expert, testified that the lack of REM sleep could eventually have taken the singer's life had he not have died when did

The trial, which has been running for eight weeks, continues. It is expected to conclude in August.

Jackson passed away aged 50 on June 25, 2009 after he received a dose of propofol administered by Murray and stopped breathing.

Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jacksonâ€™s death and is currently serving four years behind bars in a L.A. County jail for providing the fatal dose.

He is appealing the verdict, claiming it was Jackson who was responsible for his own overdose.
