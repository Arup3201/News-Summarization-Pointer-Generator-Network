This time last year Arsenal were top of the Premier League table. They added Alexis Sanchez in the summer, who’s been excellent, and now they’re 13 points off top spot, and not even in the top four.

Doesn’t make sense does it?

I suspect the Gunners will eventually finish in their precious Champions League place. But while one stellar signing every summer – Mesut Ozil in 2013, Sanchez last year – might eventually work over a long period of time, Arsenal fans have waited ages for their manager to get serious in the transfer market, in the title race and in Europe.

So maybe Arsenal need to work with more haste.

Look away Spurs fans - here's how Gareth Bale would suit the red and white of Arsenal

Alexis Sanchez has been an inspired signing for Arsenal but they remain 13 points adrift of leaders Chelsea 

Per Mertesacker (left) and Olivier Giroud can only reach a certain level... Arsenal need more than that 

In essence they need to 'sign a spine.' David Ospina might be the long-term solution in goal, if they stick with Laurent Koscielny they will definitely need a world-class centre back alongside him. A top-level defensive midfielder is a must, and so too a world-class striker.

Arsenal can keep stumbling along with Per Mertesacker, Francis Coquelin and Olivier Giroud, but on the evidence so far, these players can only reach a certain level. For domination at home and abroad (isn’t that what Arsenal fans want?) the Gunners need to aim high, show some intent and really go for it.

But there is one player beyond the spine who could make a massive difference, and signing him would be a huge statement from Arsenal Football Club in so many ways.

The Gunners should go for Gareth Bale.

Bale jumps for joy after scoring Real Madrid's second goal in their La Liga victory over Espanyol

Bale has come under fire from Real Madrid fans and the media... so, why don't Arsenal make a move for him?

Mesut Ozil returned to first-team action for Arsenal in their  win over Stoke at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday

As Bale left Tottenham for Madrid, Ozil arrived at the Emirates and Arsenal fans came up with a mildly amusing song to reflect the contrasting transfer fortunes of the north London rivals. To the tune of the Inspiral Carpets’ 1990 hit 'This is How It Feels,' Gooners sang the words:

'This is how it feels to be Tottenham,

'This is how it feels to be small,

'You sold Bale and we signed Mesut Ozil…'

The ditty conveniently ignores that Spurs also signed Christian Eriksen at that time and he turned out (so far) to be far better than Ozil for a fraction of the price. But it’s still funny.

Bale's play is similar to that of Thierry Henry in his pomp, pictured here celebrating against Everton in 2003

However, Bale is under fire in Spain for shooting too much. Sounds ridiculous, but Real Madrid fans and the media want him to give the ball to Ronaldo more.

One accusation levelled at Arsene Wenger’s side is that they don’t shoot enough, they overplay in and around the box. Go to a game at the Emirates and you’ll often hear fans’ frustrations when there’s one pass too many and a promising move breaks down.

Gareth Bale’s direct approach is reminiscent of Thierry Henry at his peak at Arsenal.

And the pain for Spurs fans of seeing Bale in an Arsenal shirt would be an added bonus for Gooners. It would be brilliant for the Premier League though.

So, why doesn't Arsene Wenger make a move for the former Spurs star?
