Ross Vodden was spared prison after he was convicted of racially aggravated behaviour after he shouted racist insults at a police officer who confronted him for kissing a stranger in the street 

The widower of the woman who inspired the Beatles song Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds has avoided jail after he launched into a racist rant at a police officer. 

Ross Vodden, 53, kissed a woman who he did not know in the street, and then swore at a policeman, calling him ‘n*****’ and ‘black c***' when the officer confronted him about the incident, Westminster Magistrates’ Court was told.

Vodden was convicted of racially aggravated behaviour after a trial last month.

He was married to Lucy Vodden, who died in 2009 after a battle with lupus. As a child Mrs Vodden is said to have been the inspiration behind Beatles song 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds', having been friends with John Lennon's son Julian at school. 

The hit song had been rumoured to be about LSD, but Lennon insisted the song was inspired by a picture of Lucy, drawn by his young son.

The court heard that on 14 September 2014 Vodden had caused alarm after he planted a kiss on a stranger in Brook Street, Westminster.

Malachy Packenham, prosecuting, said: ‘Police were made aware that the woman had been kissed on the lips by another member of the public as he passed her on the street.

‘An officer went to speak to the male, who immediately became aggressive and confrontational.’

In his rage Vodden called the police officer a ‘f***ing black c***,’ a ‘n*****,’ and a ‘black b******’, as around 20 people stood nearby. 

Following his conviction Vodden, who appeared at court today wearing a black bomber jacket emblazoned with colourful symbols and multi-coloured leg warmers, was handed a suspended prison sentence for the incident.

District Judge Richard Blake warned he would be sent to prison if convicted of another outburst.

‘You have clearly got a lot of issues so bear in mind when things happen there are two ways of dealing with it - turn away and smile or get involved,' said the judge. 

‘You have got to come to terms with the gravity of this case and the consequences if it happens again.

‘If there is a repeat of this behaviour, when you are particularly unpleasant, racially abusing people, you will go to prison.’

Vodden had previously told the judge he thought the case was 'nonsense.' 

He added: ‘You must consider it real but it happens all the time.’

The court heard Vodden is now living off benefits and is on a waiting list for social housing.

He said he is willing to engage with mental health services. He was given a 12 week prison sentence suspended for a year, ordered to pay £120 court costs and an £80 victim surcharge.

Lucy Vodden, who was Lucy O'Donnell before her marriage, went to nursery school in Surrey with Julian Lennon, the son of John Lennon, and the pair became friends. 

When he was four Julian came home from school with a picture, which he showed to his father. He described his drawing as 'Lucy in the sky with diamonds.' 

At the time Lennon was gathering material for the album, Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, released in 1967. 

Critics often claimed they believed Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds was a reference to LSD but Lennon denied the claim. 

The song was initially banned by the BBC because of its supposed reference to the drug.

Mrs Vodden died of lupus, an autoimmune disease which causes the body to attack its own cells, in 2009.

Six months before he death Julian Lennon was made aware of her disease and got back in touch with her.  

Julian Lennon drew this picture in the 1960s and told his father it was 'Lucy in the sky with diamonds'
