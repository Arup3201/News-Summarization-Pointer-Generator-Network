West Indies great Sir Viv Richards believes lifeless pitches around the world risk killing the appeal of Test cricket.

Apart from the disappointing results, England’s summer has been notable for the benign wickets at Lord’s, Headingley and now Trent Bridge.

New drainage systems have been given as one cause, the other being the desire of chief executives to make sure a Test lasts five days so as to recoup cash after having paid the England & Wales Cricket Board millions to host a match.

Concern: Sir Viv Richards is worried that poor pitches could harm Test cricket

Richards is passionate about the issue, given that the problem has already affected the Caribbean significantly. Tests in the region are routinely played on dead pitches in front of pitiful crowds.

Now Richards has warned England it is a pattern which could spread.

‘It’s a concern all around the world,’ he said. ‘Test cricket lost some its appeal a long time ago and Twenty20 competitions, like the Caribbean Premier League, have given the game a new lease of life.

‘It is up to the establishment to figure out how to make both formats work. We’ve all seen T20’s success but you also have that in the Ashes. We have to find a way to help preserve the longer version of the game.’

Ambassador: Richards, captain of West Indies in the 1980s, now works for the Caribbean Premier League

Richards, 62, who captained the great West Indies sides of the 1980s, was speaking as an ambassador for the Caribbean Premier League.

The second edition of the franchise-based Twenty20 tournament started this weekend and this year’s big draw is England outcast Kevin Pietersen, who plays his first match for St Lucia Zouks on July 27.

'I’m very excited individuals of the stature of Kevin Pietersen are coming here,’ he said.

'He will be sorely missed by England. Why the [ECB] made the decision to shorten his Test career is none of my business, all I know is he is one of England’s best. He can put bums on seats.’
