A father and his daughter have become the first pilot team to fly for British Airways.

Captain David Woodruffe and his daughter Senior First Officer Kat Woodruffe both fly Boeing 777s for the airliner. 

Kat, 32, grew up in awe of her jet-set father, who has been flying commercial jets to some of the most glamorous destinations across the world for more than 40 years.

The pair both qualified and began their flying careers at the age of 20 and now both fly Boeing 777s for British Airways.

Father-of-two David, 61, from Horsham, West Sussex, said: 'I am extremely proud of Kat and of course I’m delighted that she has carried on the family tradition. Flying is clearly in our genes.

'She was absolutely determined to become a pilot, ever since she was a little girl. She focused her education and training on it.

'She never wavered from that career path - it is all she has ever wanted to do.

Kat always wanted to be like her father who has been flying commercial jets for more than 40 years

The duo insist that once at the controls, their relationship is strictly professional and there is no rivalry

'I am very proud of her, British Airways is a very difficult airline to get into.'

Kat, who also lives in Horsham, said: 'My dad was my inspiration to become a pilot. I grew up watching him put on his uniform and flying around the world.

'Dad used to take me on a lot of trips when I was younger.

'I was about eight years-old when I just knew that it was what I wanted to do.

'I absolutely love flying, just everything about it - the glamour, the professionalism. I couldn’t imagine doing anything else.

'And I get to fly to my favourite destinations for work - my favourite place is Barbados.'

Mother-of-one Kat earned her wings as a commercial pilot 12-years-ago and has been flying777 commercial planes with BA since 2005.

The pair have even been lucky enough to share a cockpit and have flown together on several occasions to destinations including New York, Chicago and Abu Dhabi.

However, the duo insist that once at the controls, their relationship is strictly professional and there is no father-daughter rivalry.

Father-of-two David Woodruffe said he is extremely proud of his daughter Kat who followed in his footsteps

Kat always dreamed of becoming a pilot just like her father David and went on to qualify at the age of 20

Mr Woodruffe said: 'We have been lucky enough to fly together several times and of course it’s extra special to have with my daughter at the controls with me.

'But all British Airways’ pilots are trained to the same high standards so on paper it makes no difference who you’re flying with. We are both very professional.

'It is nice though, as we fly to the same long-haul destinations so we can meet up while we are away and compare notes on restaurants and things to do.

'I try to avoid flying with her too much though as it always seems to cost me money.

Like father, like daughter: Captain David Woodruffe and Senior First Officer Kat Woodruffe

'Whenever we meet up or are in the same place together she always mysteriously loses her credit card or has left it at home.'

Kat is now hoping that her own daughter, 13-month-old Poppy, may continue the family tradition and also grow up to work in the ‘family trade’.

She said: 'I am a mum myself now and I would absolutely love it if my daughter decided to carry on the tradition and followed in our footsteps as well.

'To become a mummy-daughter pilot team would be lovely.'
