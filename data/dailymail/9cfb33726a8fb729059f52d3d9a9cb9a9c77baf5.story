A mother almost died when she was engulfed by flames in a horrifying wickless candle accident.

Anna Cooper, 35, suffered first-, second- and third-degree burns when she was accidentally covered in vapour from a wickless candle on her patio.

A spark from the candle, sometimes known as a gel burner, flew off and hit her chest.

Mrs Cooper, from Dereham, Norfolk, tried to flick the burning ember off her, but within seconds she was engulfed in flames.

A friend managed to extinguish the flames with a glass of lemonade before screaming at her to go and get into the shower.

Mrs Cooper was taken hospital where she was given morphine and put on a drip to replace the vital fluids she'd lost.

The businesswoman was burned all over her chest and 
right arm following the accident - which took place during a family get-together. She remained in hospital for a week.

The terrifying incident happened in 
July - just eight weeks after the mother of Isla, eight, and Oliver, 11, 
got married in Jamaica to her partner Gavin.

Mrs Cooper said today she had joked with her new husband that something would happen to 'burst their bubble'.

Mrs Cooper, who also has three stepchildren, said: 'I'm very lucky to be here, I could easily have died.

'The pain was excruciating. I've never had pain like that before. I was on gas and air before I even got out of Dereham.Â 

'I still have nightmares about it and I can't sleep and Isla has been traumatised by it. Ultimately, I'm lucky to be here.

'If I had gasped in, that would have gone down my airways and I probably would be dead.'

Gel burners or wickless candles are commonly used both inside and outside the home.

Users fill a small well-like area with special gel fuel that is then set alight - creating a flame.

Following the horrible accident, Mrs Cooper has started a new business venture - tending graves for families who cannot visit them very regularly.

New start: Mrs Cooper is now fully recovered from the accident and has opened a new grave-tending business

Mrs Cooper said: 'Being in hospital made me realise I wanted to provide for my children and gave me some time to think.

'I lost my father four and a half years ago and his ashes are in Surrey.

'I don't get the chance to go down there as much as I would like and give him flowers.

'It got me thinking that there must be people here who don't get the chance to go to their loved one's graves and I'm trying to offer them a service.'
