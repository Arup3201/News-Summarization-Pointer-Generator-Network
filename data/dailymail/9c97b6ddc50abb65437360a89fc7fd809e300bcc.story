A man accused of setting up a fake Facebook profile to lure a 15-year-old girl to her death pleaded not guilty Wednesday to murder and kidnapping charges.

Kyle Dube, 20, of Orono, entered the pleas during his arraignment at the Penobscot Judicial Center. Defense lawyer Stephen Smith requested a psychological evaluation for Dube to determine if he is competent to stand trial.

The 20-year-old suspect was returned to jail after the brief court appearance, which was attended by the slain teen's mother, who sat in the front row dressed in a yellow T-shirt with her daughter's picture and clutched the girl's stuffed teddy bear in her hands.

Kyle Dube, 20, who faces one count each of kidnapping and murder in the death of Nichole Cable, told Superior Court Justice Ann Murray that he understood the charges against him when he entered the two pleas

The presiding judge has yet to set a trial date. If convicted of kidnapping and murder, Dube would face between 25 years and life in prison, Bangor Daily News reported.

If acquitted by reason of insanity, 
Dube would be committed to a psychiatric institution until he is deemed 
not to be a risk to society.

Dube is accused of creating a phony 
Facebook account and using it to set up a meeting with Nichole Cable, of
Glenburn, before killing her and hiding her body on May 12.

Police say Dube told others that he'd
intended to abduct Nichole and later come to her rescue. Her remains 
were found in nearby Old Town eight days after she disappeared.

Nichole was reported missing May 13 
by her mother, who said she had left the night before to meet a friend 
at the end of their road but hadn't returned.

Dube told others that he bound 
Nichole and put her in the back of his father's pickup truck and that he
later discovered she was dead, authorities said.

An autopsy determined she died from asphyxiation.

Dozens of law enforcement officers, 
using aircraft and dogs, and hundreds of civilian volunteers spent days 
searching for Nichole, whose body was found the night of May 20.

About 300 people turned out for her funeral.A man who staged the kidnapping and rescue of a 15-year-old girl so he could look like a hero 
but ended up killing her
tried to kiss and grope her the night before she disappeared, according to court documents.

According to court documents released 
earlier this month, Dube had allegedly tried to kiss and grope Cable the
night before she vanished.

The affidavit included text messages 
in which Cable tells her boyfriend that she tried pushing Dube off her, 
but he wouldn't stop and ended up leaving a bite mark on her.

Mr Dube was indicted in late May on 
charges of murder and kidnapping in the death of 15-year-old Nichole 
Cable, whose body was found in a wooded area of Old Town this month a 
week after she went missing.

In
an affidavit released after Dube was indicted, Detective Thomas 
Pickering outlined the scenario leading to the high school sophomore's 
death.

He wrote that 
Dube told his brother that he used Facebook to trick her into going out 
of her house in Glenburn, not far from Old Town, while he waited in the 
woods wearing a ski mask.

When Nichole came along, the 
20-year-old Dube jumped out and snatched her, duct-taped her and put her
in the back of his father's pickup truck, the affidavit said. Dube 
later discovered that she was dead, so he dumped her body and covered it
with branches, it said.

The affidavit doesn't go into details 
about how Nichole was duct-taped, and the cause of her death is still 
being determined by the medical examiner's office.

Dube told his brother that he 'intended to kidnap Nichole and hide her; that he would later find her 
and be the hero,' Pickering wrote.

Dube's attorney, Stephen Smith, had argued for the affidavit to be withheld, citing threats 
against Dube in jail, concerns about whether he could get a fair trial 
and fears for the privacy of his relatives.

Nichole was reported missing on May 13
by her mother, who said she had left the night before to meet a friend 
at the end of the driveway but hadn't returned.

Police interviewed a friend of 
Nichole's named Bryan Butterfield, who said somebody had set up a fake 
Facebook account in his name and he suspected Dube. Butterfield told 
detectives that Dube wanted to have sex with Nichole but that she had 
rejected his advances, the affidavit said.

Investigators determined that Nichole 
had frequent contact with the fake Butterfield on Facebook and that the 
person posing as Butterfield repeatedly requested to meet with her 
before she agreed to meet with him at the end of her road to get some 
marijuana the night she went missing, the affidavit said.

Police asked Facebook officials to 
produce records to identify the owner of the fake Butterfield account, 
which was traced to Dube and his parents' home in Orono.

When a detective interviewed Dube's 
girlfriend, Sarah Mersinger, she reported that Dube told her where he 
left Nichole's body. Dube's brother, Dustin Dube, then told police what 
he knew.

Dozens of law enforcement officers, 
using aircraft and dogs, and hundreds of civilian volunteers had spent 
days searching for Nichole, whose body was found on the night of May 20.
About 300 people turned out for her funeral.
