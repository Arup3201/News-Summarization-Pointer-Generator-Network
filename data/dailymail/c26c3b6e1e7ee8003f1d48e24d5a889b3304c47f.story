A study has claimed that religious Jewish teens exhibit less suicide-risk behaviour than their secular Jewish peers.

The research suggests that observing Judaism helps to protect adolescents against suicide - despite still being depressed.

The conclusion was drawn by surveying hundreds of adolescents and their mothers in Israel. 

A study led by Tel Aviv University has claimed that adolescents who practice Judaism (stock image shown) are less likely to commit suicide than their secular peers. They claim that religious Jewish teens exhibit 45 per cent less suicide-risk behaviour than non-religious teens

The study by the Israeli Health Ministry was published in the journal European Psychiatry.

Home interviews of 620 Jewish adolescents aged 14 to 17 and their mothers were carried out in the survey.

It assessed sociodemographic characteristics and mental health, including suicidal thoughts and behaviours.

Participants were asked to define their degree of religiosity as 'secular,' 'observant,' or 'ultra-Orthodox,' the three main categories of Judaism in Israel.

Researchers from the University of Vienna have found a correlation between sunshine hours and suicide rates.

They discovered that suicides increased when a day was particularly sunny.

However if the preceding 14 to 60 days were sunny the rate dropped.

The former was more noticeable in females, and the latter in males.

While a cause is not known sunlight is thought to alter levels of serotonin, which is known to affect peoples' moods.

And the results showed that religious Jewish teenagers exhibit 45 per cent less suicide-risk behavior, including attempted suicide, than their secular Jewish peers.

The researchers say this suggests that religious observance helps protect Jewish adolescents against suicide.

'Death by suicide is one of the most common causes of death in the adolescent population, and it is potentially preventable,' said one of the study's authors Dr Ben Amit from Tel Aviv University's Sackler School of Medicine

'This has led us, like many other researchers, to try to better understand the reasons leading to adolescent suicide - to reduce its occurrence.'

He added: 'Recognising the risk factors and mechanisms associated with self-harm and suicide is important in the prevention of adolescent suicide.

'As this is the first study demonstrating a protective effect for religiosity against suicide in Jewish adolescents, we believe it may provide valuable insight for both clinicians and policymakers dealing with Jewish adolescents, in Israel and worldwide.'

In the research 620 Jewish teens were asked to define their degree of religiosity as 'secular,' 'observant,' or 'ultra-Orthodox'. And it was found that those who weren't secular had less suicidal thoughts (stock image shown), despite still being depressed

In the US suicide ranks behind only accidents and murder as a leading killer of 15-to-24 year-olds, according to the National Institute for Mental Health.

Israel's suicide rate, on the other hand, is among the lowest in the developed world.

'For many of these teens, suicide is simply about losing hope,' said co-author Dr Gal Shoval, also of Tel Aviv University. 

'We know from working with suicide survivors that even when they were 99 percent sure they were going to kill themselves, they still sought hope. 

'Jewish faith and community may be their most important source of hope.' 

Dr Amit added: 'Using statistical tools, we demonstrated that the protective effect of the practice of Judaism was not associated with a decreased risk of depression. Instead, it enhanced effective coping mechanisms.

'This stands in direct contrast to studies of religious Christian teenagers who reported feeling less depressed than their secular peers.'
