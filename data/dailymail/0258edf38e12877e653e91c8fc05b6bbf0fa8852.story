The cheerful American Alison Riske joked that David Beckham watching her getting thrashed by Maria Sharapova meant that she was actually ‘half winning’, although the scoreline told a different story.

Before what is now the traditional Saturday Royal Box audience of sporting aristocrats she went down 6-3 6-0 to the No 5 seed, who will be fancying her chances of another Wimbledon title on the 10th anniversary of her first.

Although Sharapova admitted she was unaware who Sachin Tendulkar was in the privileged seats above her on Centre Court, Beckham is very familiar. They have much in common, being among the most commercially savvy high profile athletes of the modern age.

‘I’ve actually met him a couple times at different events in L.A. and in London,’ she said.

‘He’s a great guy. Besides being an incredible football player, there is so much that he’s done in his career, having a family, maintaining so many things off the court. Really nice person to chat to.

'We’re not best buddies or anything, but it’s nice to be able to say hello and congratulate each other on achievements we’ve had in our careers and so on.’

Beckham would doubtless admire Sharapova’s idea of opening a sweet shop in Wimbledon Village for the duration of the tournament, and he shares with her an ability to compartmentalise the different aspects of sporting and business life.

She enjoyed competing in front of others who have achieved in sport, even if she did not recognise many of them: ‘I always feel like I really understand them and actually get star struck more when I’m around athletes that have done incredible things in their careers, rather than maybe musicians.’

More on her mind is facing her next opponent, either Germany’s number nine seed Angelique Kerber and last year’s surprise semi-finalist, Kirsten Flipkens of Holland.

It is one of tennis’s stranger facts of recent times that, having won it as a 17 year-old, Sharapova has never added to her tally of SW19 triumphs while managing two Grand Slams at the French Open on what used to be her weakest surface of clay.

She is now looking to become the first woman since Serena Williams in 2002 to pulling off the French Open and Wimbledon double in the same year.

The chances of her pulling that off rose slightly as she enjoyed a straightforward progression into the last 16 while her rivals had the tedium of sitting it out in the locker room waiting for the rain to subside.

The Russian had the roof to thank for that, and she will not have been unhappy to have been in the temporarily sealed bubble anyway. Shutting out the elements is good for her game as there is less to interfere with her sometimes unreliable serve, which was in good working order.

It will need to stay that way, as she is in what is very much the most difficult portion of the draw, full of potential threats.

Faced with world number 44 Riske she got off to a slow start and was broken in the very first game, reviving memories of 12 months ago when she was bundled out of the second round here.

‘She has had some good results on grass, so I knew it was going to be a challenge,’ reflected Sharapova afterwards.

Ultimately, though, it was a procession, as from 1-3 down she reeled off the next 11 games, accompanied by her trademark shriek that echoed around thanks to the roof.

Riske was overmatched against this 2014 version of Sharapova that moves much better than the old one used to do.

Coupled with the determination that has not been curtailed by so many millions in the bank, you could even see her going all the way next week.
