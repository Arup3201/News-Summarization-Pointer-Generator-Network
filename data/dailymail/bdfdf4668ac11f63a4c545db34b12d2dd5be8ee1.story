Competitive sports put some children off exercise for life and primary schools should be told to offer less taxing alternatives, MPs have warned.

Safeguarding Britain’s Olympic legacy is about allowing as many children as possible to enjoy the health benefits of sport through non-competitive activities, they say in a report out today.

The Commons Education Committee warned that competitive team sports have a ‘limited appeal’ to some children and politicians’ focus on them can be ‘counter-productive’.

Number one: As England celebrate the euphoria of trouncing Australia in the Ashes, MPs publish a report saying shifting the focus from competitive to non-competitive sports will help tackle obesity

During the Games last summer David Cameron announced that competitive team sports would be made compulsory for all primary school children in England.

He pledged funding for new sports teachers to inspire the next generation of top athletes, and expressed concerns that Indian dance was being counted as physical education.

But the committee of MPs urged the Department for Education to make clear to schools that there should also be non-competitive activities to increase the wellbeing of all children, and help control obesity.

The committee chairman, Tory MP Graham Stuart, said the 2012 Games was a ‘magical time’ which generated ‘massive enthusiasm’ for sport among young people.

‘High-quality school sport is vitally important,’ he said. ‘It provides young people with opportunities to improve their education, health and well-being.

'We need to be encouraging all young people to take part in sport; whether they enjoy the competition of football, rugby or netball or prefer non-competitive activities. Schools must provide a range of activities that appeal to all.’ 

Competitive sports ‘can bring many benefits to young people in terms of resilience, organisation and team work’, the report said, but a focus on winning ‘can be a disincentive as a much as incentive’ for some children.

While the Government has injected £300million into primary school sports provision for the next two years, the MPs warned there is no long-term plan when that ends in 2015.

They said ministers needed to act to make sure the momentum was not lost ‘amid short-term plans and funding’ or their promises risked becoming a ‘gimmick’.

Inclusive: MPs say that safeguarding Britain's Olympic legacy means getting as many children as possible to engage with exercise rather than focusing on coming first

The committee took evidence from education think tanks, as well as the Youth Sport Trust and the Rugby Football Union, which recommended more provision for non-competitive sport – although 59 per cent of primary schools said they offer this in the form of activities such as dance.

Meanwhile 67 per cent of primaries said their pupils entered inter-school competitions.

All 17,000 primary schools in England and Wales have been given funding to improve their sports provision until 2015, and around 120 dedicated sports teachers are being trained.

Mr Stuart said: ‘We are concerned that the Government’s primary sport premium – while correctly focused – is only being given to schools for two years.

‘This is simply not long enough for schools to build sustained provision ... if the funding is not extended, there is a risk the primary sport premium will become little more than a gimmick.’
