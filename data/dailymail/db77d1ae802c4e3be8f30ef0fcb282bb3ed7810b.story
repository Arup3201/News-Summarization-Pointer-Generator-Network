Serena Williams has finally succeeded in taking the pressure off herself at a grand slam and is two matches away from a third successive US Open title.

The world number one had a sensational season in 2013, winning 78 matches and losing just four, but two of those defeats came unexpectedly at grand slams.

Williams' phenomenal success everywhere else made up for it but this season underperforming at slams has become a trend.

Relaxed: Serena Williams believes she can play without pressure as she aims to retain her US Open title

She was beaten in the fourth round at the Australian Open by Ana Ivanovic, slumped to a miserable defeat against Garbine Muguruza in the second round of the French Open and then went out in the third round at Wimbledon to Alize Cornet.

The common thread was how tight and nervous Williams looked, the pressure both internal and external clearly a major hindrance.

The US Open is the 32-year-old's last chance this season to get to 18 slam singles titles, the same mark as Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova.

Determined: Williams is after a third successive US Open title having struggled in the Grand Slams this season

Agitated: The American has appeared to shows signs of pressure this year as she chases an 18th Grand Slam 

Champion: Williams is the reigning champion at Flushing Meadows and already has five US Open titles

Williams said with a laugh that the number 18 meant 'legal and legendary' to her, and she revealed seeing the funny side of this season had helped her relax.

'It's so easy now because it's almost a joke for me because I have done little to no winning in the majors,' she said.

'And I thought, "Take it as a joke. Oh my God, I'm past the fourth round. Woo". I better play doubles just in case I don't make it past the second round. At least I have a back-up plan.'

Williams has stayed cool and projected an air of control throughout her five matches so far, never dropping more than three games in any set.

Against Flavia Pennetta in the quarter-finals she was 3-0 down but responded with a run of six games in a row.

Challenger: 17th seed Ekaterina Makarova, in her first singles semi-final at a slam, is Williams' opponent 

In the last four she meets another player yet to drop a set, Russian Ekaterina Makarova.

The 17th seed, who is into her first singles semi-final at a slam, has the distinction of being the only left-hander to beat Williams at a major.

That was in Australia in 2012, but Makarova has already tasted victory over her opponent this tournament in doubles, and she and fellow Russian Elena Vesnina are through to the women's doubles final.

Williams has won their other three singles meetings, including in Dubai earlier this year, and is looking forward to the challenge.

She said: 'I have played two lefties already and I often practice with (fellow American) Varvara (Lepchenko). She's a lefty. I think that's been good for me, so I'm ready for the lefty.

'I think it will be a good match. She's beaten me before. I am obviously going to go in there and just try to do the best I can.

Other side: Former World number one Caroline Wozniacki is hoping to repeat her run to the final in 2009

'Makarova moves well. She doesn't care who she plays, she gives 100 per cent. Those types of players are often difficult to play because it makes them better. She has a lot of momentum going into this match as well.'

The other semi-final pits Williams' great friend Caroline Wozniacki against Chinese surprise package Peng Shuai, who is another first-time slam semi-finalist.

Wozniacki has been here before but not for three years, while her only slam final came in New York in 2009.

The Dane enjoyed a prodigious rise up the rankings as a teenager and was ranked number one in the world by the time she was 20.

But the last three years have been a story of underperforming at the slams and endless questions about her game and whether it is aggressive enough.

Surprise package: China's Peng Shuai has shocked the draw by reaching the semi-finals against Wozniacki

In March this year she dropped to a low of 18 in the rankings but, coincidentally or not, since the split from fiance Rory McIlroy in May she has reached a different level.

Wozniacki refuses to link the two and has simply referred to her 'up and down' year, but something is certainly driving the 24-year-old on like never before.

She produced arguably the performance of her career to upset Maria Sharapova in the fourth round and then thrashed Sara Errani to reach the last four.

'I just listen to myself and my coach,' she said. 'I always try to work hard and try and be better. You always try and add to your game. You have to, because everyone knows how you play.

'It will always go up and down in sports. I'm just happy I'm on my way up again and I'm playing well.

'I have proven people wrong so many times. I was told when I was younger there is no chance I will make the top 100, top 50, top 30. Every time I have proven them wrong. It's kind of nice.'
