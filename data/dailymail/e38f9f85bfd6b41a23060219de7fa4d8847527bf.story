Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti has revealed he would like to return to the Premier League should he leave the Spanish giants before he retires.

The former Chelsea boss won the league and FA Cup in his first year in charge at Stamford Bridge in 2010 - the Blues' first ever double - but was sacked by Roman Abramovich a year later.

The 55-year-old Italian was then appointed manager of Paris Saint-Germain and won the Ligue 1 title in his second season in charge, before winning the Champions League with Real last year.

Despite his controversial exit from Stamford Bridge, Ancelotti still harbours the ambition of once again managing in English football.

'I loved England I was very happy at Chelsea,' he told The Sun. 'I liked the atmosphere, the supporters. I have the best memories.

'I'd like to return. It depends how long this adventure lasts. If it lasts a long time I will retire after it. But if it doesn't then I will come to England. For sure.

'The day I leave Madrid there are two solutions. Either I quit football or I come back to England.'

Ancelotti, who also denied reports that he was approached to succeed both Sir Alex Ferguson and David Moyes as Manchester United manager, is open to a return to Chelsea but doubts that such a move would materialise.

'No, I don't think Abramovich will change his mind. I know he did with (Jose) Mourinho. As I said I have no problem with Abramovich.

'They were two beautiful years. But it's not about a particular club, it's about the atmosphere.

'But I don't say no. I certainly wouldn't say no.'
