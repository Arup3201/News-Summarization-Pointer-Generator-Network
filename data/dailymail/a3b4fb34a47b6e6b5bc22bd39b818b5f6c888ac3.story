An Atlanta man already accused of gunning down two homeless men in their sleep and fatally shooting a hairstylist as she walked to her car now faces charges in the death of a fourth person.

Aeman Lovel Presley, 34, is suspected of killing Calvin Gholston at a shopping center on Sept. 27, investigators say.

Like two of the previous victims, Gholston was homeless, police said.

Police already have accused Presley of killing two homeless men in Atlanta, firing multiple times while the victims were wrapped in blankets and sleeping on the sidewalk.

Dorian Jenkins was killed Nov. 23, followed by Tommy Mims on Nov. 26.

Investigators have said both homeless men were shot with an elongated .45-caliber bullet — often called a 'cowboy bullet.' 

In their investigation, police emphasized the type of bullet used as they asked the public and law enforcement agencies nationwide for help with the seemingly random shootings of the homeless men.

Jenkins was shot five times and Mims was shot seven times, and police have described it as 'overkill.'

Presley also faces a murder charge in the Dec. 6 death of Karen Pearce, a hairstylist, in Decatur, just outside Atlanta. 

Police said Pearce was shot as she walked to her car after leaving a downtown restaurant.

A break in the case came Thursday when a transit system police officer saw Presley pass through a transit station entry gate with paying a fare, authorities said. He was carrying a loaded revolver and a box of ammunition, officials said.

No attorney was listed for Presley in online court records Tuesday.
