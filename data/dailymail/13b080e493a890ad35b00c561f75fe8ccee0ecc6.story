This is it - Manchester City can ill-afford any sort of slip.

Forget Chelsea, Manchester United and even Bayern Munich; the Stadio Olimpico is the scene of Manuel Pellegrini’s most important night of what has been an indifferent four months.

Not since the Premier League champions dispensed of Aston Villa in May – an evening etched with nerves – on their way to the title have City had so much riding on a 90 minutes.

Yes, the victory against Pep Guardiola’s Bayern a fortnight ago was staggeringly intense and of great significance, but Wednesday’s trip to Rome is that bit bigger.

With the wealth of quality at his disposal, for Pellegrini not to reach the Champions League last-16 would be unthinkable; it could mark his eventual demise as the club’s manager.

And they are so close, knowing a win at Roma would seal a spot for the second reason running. If they weren’t to achieve the minimum requirement of progression, the failure would not be down to this week but those preceding it.

The pressure is now intensified. But City save their very best to last. Think Bayern at the Etihad, QPR on that final day.

They will have to do it without Sergio Aguero this time, however, who left the field in tears on Saturday evening as they beat Everton. Easier said than done.

Jovetic is likely to start up front for Pellegrini's Premier League champions in Rome on Wednesday 

The Montenegrin completed his sprinting drills at the back of the queue on Tuesday morning  

Nineteen goals already this season – including two late on against the Germans to keep their European hopes alive – goes a long way in pointing towards the Argentine’s importance. He will undoubtedly be a miss, but these City players know the importance of reaching the knockout stages. Their careers in the North West depend on it.

‘Let’s be honest, we need to do something or otherwise next year it’s going to be new players, it’s going to be everything,’ said Samir Nasri ahead of the win against Bayern. ‘That’s how it works when you play for a big club. With the salary of every player and the level of those players, 90 per cent of the team is world class.

‘Then not to qualify from the first round of the Champions League would be a huge blow for the club — and for us as well. With the players we have and everything, the owner gives us his trust, we have to return it in the Champions League. It’s the perfect scene to show we can compete with the best team in the world.

‘We have a chance to play for a big club and we are treated the right way. Sometimes it’s not good to talk too much, it’s better to talk with your feet. We have leaders in the squad and the manager talks a lot as well. So stop talking.’

The talking stops on Wednesday, and don’t bet against City coming out of Italy with the result they need.
