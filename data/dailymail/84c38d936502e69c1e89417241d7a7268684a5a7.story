A teenager  has testified that he had 'a lot' of sex with his Catholic high school tutor after she took his virginity - even though she claims he was the one to pressure her into a relationship.

The boy, who was just 15 at the time of the alleged three-month relationship in 2013, took the stand for the fourth day in Kent County Circuit Court in Michigan on Wednesday.

During his testimony, he denied that he had 'stalked, coerced and brutalized' Abigail Simon, now 35, into going out with him and having sex, as she has claimed, Mlive reported.

Simon was fired from her role as a tutor and study hall supervisor at Catholic Central and West Catholic schools after the boy's mother found pictures of her in a garter belt on her son's phone. 

Charged: Abigail Simon, a 35-year-old math tutor pictured during a previous court appearance, is on trial for allegedly having sex with a 15-year-old male student. She has claimed her coerced her into having sex

Denial: Simon's lawyers say the young man  was the aggressor in the relationship - which he denies

She was arrested at her family's home in Flint in August and is charged with four counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. 

On the stand on Wednesday, he denied that he had pressured her into sex, slapped her or held her down, as she had claimed. He also said that she had never told him to stop or cried during sex.

'She never said no,' he said. 'I never forcibly raped her.'

They are accused of starting a relationship through text messages in February 2013 before having sex in March 2013. The relationship continued through April.

He claimed that he was a virgin before he entered into a relationship with Simon and that the teacher had introduced him to rough sex.

He testified that they first had sex on the sofa in her apartment after a dinner date and that she performed a sex act on him.

Before the dinner, they had checked the restaurant to make sure there was no one there they knew, he said.

Afterwards, almost all of their encounters allegedly took place at Simon's apartment in the 300 block of Bridge Street North West in Grand Rapids.

'We had intercourse a lot,' the teenager said, later adding that they had sex every other day.

They also took day trips together, he testified, including to Chicago to meet her friends in early March and later to South Bend. 

The court has also seen texts between the two, which the prosecution claimed showed Simon was sexually forward with the boy.

One of the texts from Simon to the boy read: 'I'm scared that you're only 15.'

Simon and the alleged victim referred to each other in pet names, the teen testified Monday. He said Simon called him 'boo' and he called his former tutor 'baby girl', according to Wood TV.

The boy was also quizzed about how controlling he was in the relationship. He denied that he made her send photos of herself while she traveled alone to ensure she was not with men.

Inappropriate: Abigail Marie Simon, 35, was working at Catholic Central High School in Grand Rapids when she allegedly began the relationship with the 15-year-old boy in February 2013

He said that it was Simon who became upset and refused to talk to him when he attended a party where there were other girls. She instructed him to go to her apartment, he said.

Afterwards, he punched a wall and injured his hand because he felt guilty for making her worry about the party, he said. 

Prosecutors read a text from Simon that she sent while on spring break in Florida.

Simon told the teen he should be with girls his age, saying: 'I'm just too old, as much as that stinks.'

However the victim refused, begging Simon in another text: 'Please give me one more chance.'

Simon is charged with first-degree sexual assault and accosting a minor for immoral purposes.
