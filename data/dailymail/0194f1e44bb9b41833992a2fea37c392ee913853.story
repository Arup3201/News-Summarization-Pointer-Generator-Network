Two teenage boys who discovered a human skull have returned to the scene and found the rest of the body.

Christian Thompson and Robbie Cribley, both 13, discovered the skeletal remains in the River Coln in Fairford, Gloucestershire, which have now been dated back to Saxon times.

The schoolboys have also found what is thought to be a spine and arm bone which forensic experts are examining to date them more precisely.

Their second discovery came as they returned with a television crew to the scene where they had been paddling in a dingy near their homes.

The boys have speculated as to where the skull came from, suggesting that someone was kidnapped and left in the river

It was the skull which was first found by the two boys, who attend Farmor’s Comprehensive school in Fairfordm, in scenes  reminiscent of classic movie Stand by Me featuring a group of adolescent boys hunting for the body of a missing child.

Initially they thought it must have been an animal skull.

But, after closer examination, they were shocked to discover it was the remains of a human.

Christian Thompson: 'I find it intriguing because we have been studying the Saxons in class. Someone must have been kidnapped and chucked in the river.'

Christian, who lives near to the 
spot, said: 'We became stuck in some reeds and when we tried to pull the
dingy to the bank, I saw the skull by my right foot.

'I asked Robbie if 
he thought it was a human skull and we both agreed that it was.

'I find it intriguing because we have been studying the Saxons in class.

'They think there is a Saxon burial 
ground in the area dating back 700 years.

'We go down to the river almost
every weekend but never thought we would find a skeleton.'

Christian's mother Marie, who first thought
it was an overactive imagination, said: 'When 
they found the skull, they were both a bit worried about it.

'I thought 
they were being silly but, when they went back with my husband, they 
could see it quite clearly.

'It’s unbelievable.'

His father Steve suspected it would be an animal skull.

'We're always finding cows teeth and stuff in the river but I've never know something like this to turn up,' he said. 'The police didn't even believe it when we rang them too.'

The boys' families are 
still bewildered by the shocking discovery and are keen to know where 
the skull might have come from.

But the 13-year-olds already have their suspicions of what sinister deeds took place.

'I think someone must have been kidnapped and chucked in the river,' said Christian.

Gloucestershire Police confirmed this week that the remains were human.

'It's believed that the remains could have been there for many, many years,' a spokesman said.

The scenes are reminiscent of classic coming of age drama Stand By Me. A
group of adolescents search for the body of a missing boy

'A forensic anthropologist has been contacted who will examine the remains and help identify when the individual passed away.'

A police spokesman said: 'At 
approximately 6.40pm on Sunday, July 7, Gloucestershire police were 
called to Cinder Lane in Fairford to reports that members of the public 
had found what appeared to be human remains.

'It’s believed that the remains could have been there for many, many years.'

'A forensic anthropologist has been contacted who will examine the remains and help identify when the individual passed away.

'The skeleton was found lodged on the river’s bed between Cinder Lane and Cutler’s field. 

'They may have also found a spine and an arm bone and the rest of the body is now being excavated.'
