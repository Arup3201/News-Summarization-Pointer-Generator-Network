As if losing 3-1 with some controversial refereeing decisions playing a key part wasn't harsh enough on Croatia, they could be set to lose star playmaker Luka Modric for their must-win game against Cameroon.

Real Madrid midfielder Modric is a doubt for Croatia's second game after picking up a foot injury in his side's loss to Brazil in the tournament opener.

Croatia team officials said that Modric was taken to a hospital in Salvador, near the squad's training base, to check the extent of his injury after feeling pain.

Modric's absence in the June 18 match against Cameroon would be a major blow for Croatia, who sit joint bottom of Group A with the African outfit, who lost 1-0 against Mexico on Friday.

The skillful Real Madrid midfielder is the backbone of the powerful Croatian midfield and could prove difficult to replace, although his absence could allow Barcelona-bound Ivan Rakitic to move into a more familiar advanced role.

Modric has been in brilliant form for Real, becoming a key cog of the Champions League winning side after a difficult first season in Spain.

Croatia could have caused an upset in the tournament opener against hosts Brazil but eventually lost out 3-1 with referee Yuichi Nishimura taking much of the blame for awarding a soft penalty when the score was 1-1.

Nishimura was also the subject of criticism for choosing not to give matchwinner Neymar a red card after he appeared to aim an elbow at Modric before going on to score twice.

Croatia are also missing Bayern Munich striker Mario Mandzukic who picked up a two-game ban for a red card in their final World Cup qualifier against Iceland.
