ITV has been accused of an 'epic fail' after it cut short an interview with former-Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho last night as he looked set to reveal plans for a return to the Premier League.

The Real Madrid manager was being interviewed by Gabriel Clarke after his side's semi-final defeat to Borussia Dortmund that sent them out of the Champions League.

Towards the end of the interview, Clarke said: 'We're going to have to leave it there. Many commiserations tonight. Maybe next season with Real?'

ITV have been criticised for cutting off Jose Mourinho as he looked set to reveal his next career move

Thumbs up to a move? Mourinho was speaking following Real's semi-final aggregate defeat by Dortmund and hinted afterwards that he could return to Chelsea

Mourinho replied 'maybe not', and when asked why he said: 'I want to be where people love me...'

But rather than push him on reports that he is planning a return to Chelsea, Clarke said: 'We'll take that as England'. 

Fans took to Twitter to voice their anger at the abrupt end to the interview.

England 1 USA 1 (World Cup, June 12, 2010)

ITV was forced to apologise after their HD coverage cut off England's opening World Cup goal against the United States.

ITV1 viewers saw Steven Gerrard's opening goal after four minutes but fans watching on HD were left bemused after the broadcaster suddenly switched to a Hyundai advert.

Everton 1 Liverpool 0 (FA Cup, February 4, 2009)

ITV sparked a storm of protest in 2009 after millions of viewers missed Dan Goslingâ€™s dramatic winner in the Merseyside FA Cup derby.

After nearly two hours of a pulsating fourth-round replay - and with barely two minutes to go until a natural break - ITV cut to adverts in some regions.

One user called Sripad wrote: 'Still 
annoyed that ITV cut off Jose Mourinho.. He was revealing all the things
 a Chelsea fan would love to hear.'

Richard Swann wrote: 'Epic fail from ITV once again', followed by the words sorryjose and gottogo.

Mike Peters wrote: 'Well done ITV. Cutting off Mourinho as he's revealing where he's going to be next season to get to the news. You utter clowns.'

Within minutes mock-up pictures of 
ITV cutting off the likes of Martin Luther King Jr and Barack Obama 
during their historic speeches were posted online.

The interview has been compared to 
Adele's acceptance speech at the 2012 Brit Awards where host James 
Corden was forced to interrupt her so ITV could cut to the news.

It is not the first time the 
broadcaster has been criticised for its football coverage after it cut 
to adverts at crucial points in matches. 

In 2010, HD viewers missed Steven Gerrard's opening goal when coverage was interrupted by a Hyundai advert.

The previous year, an advertisement 
for Tic Tac mints meant viewers missed Everton's 118th minute winning 
goal against Liverpool in the FA Cup.

Portuguese manager Mourinho has repeatedly been linked with his former club Chelsea.

At a press conference 
following his side's 4-3 aggregate defeat, Mourinho said he 'hated' it 
in Spain and that he was 'loved' in England.

He
 said: 'I haven't made a decision because I have a contract here [with 
Madrid]. In football people break contracts when they want to but more 
than the contract, it's the respect I have for the club and for the 
players.

'I know that in 
England I am loved by the fans and the media, who are fair with me. They
 criticise me when they have to but give me credit when I deserve it.

'I
 know I am loved by some clubs, especially one, but in Spain it's a bit 
different, some people hate me, many of them are in this room [Spanish 
journalists], so its difficult for me because I like the club.
