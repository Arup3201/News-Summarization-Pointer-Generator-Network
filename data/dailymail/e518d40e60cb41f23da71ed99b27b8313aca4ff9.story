A 2-year-old Belgian Malinois was supposed to be the ninth member of the police force in the Oregon coastal town of Cannon Beach, but Cash just didn't have what it takes.

The dog was dismissed from the force before seeing any action or gaining any glory.

Cash was skittish, afraid of heights and had a barking problem. Noises would scare him. When he had to jump onto counters in search of drugs, he showed too much resistance.

Cash, a 2-year-old Belgian Malinois, was supposed to be the ninth member of the police force in the Oregon coastal town of Cannon Beach, but according to officers he just doesn't have what it takes

He would often bark aggressively rather than go straight to the drugs.

Barking is 'fine as an alert, but you can't get anything done when you're trying to get him to find dope and he's just barking in your face,' said Officer Josh Gregory, the dog's former handler, told the Daily Astorian.

'That's not the temperament we wanted to set for Cannon Beach,' Police Chief Jason Schermerhorn said.

Cash was returned to his original owner, Tami Schultz of Clatsop County Search and Rescue, and the Cannon Beach Police Department is searching for a replacement.

The Cannon Beach Police Department acquired Cash after raising $27,000 for the K-9 officer program earlier this year

They're looking for a 'ball-crazy, happy, wanting-to-work dog,' said Gregory, who will spend two to three weeks training with the dog after taking it into his care. '(We) basically learn how to dance together.'

The department acquired Cash after raising $27,000 for the K-9 officer program earlier this year.

Gregory and the Washington County trainer tried to train Cash for four weeks, between September and October, before giving up on him. 

'Where other dogs were progressing, he wasn't progressing,' Gregory said.
