A pensioner who jumped in a canal, a woman who believed she was 'queen of heaven' and a boy who responded to the name 'broken window' - these are just some of the patients detailed in medical records from a Victorian insane asylum.

The records detail hundreds of former patients at the Stanley Royd Hospital, part of the West Riding Pauper Asylum, between 1814 and 1991.

They are currently being held by West Yorkshire Archive Service (WYAS), in Wakefield, West Yorkshire.

Today, the records have been added to the UK National Register of Documentary Heritage - run by the UNESCO Memory of the World Programme.

A collection of records (pictured) detailing the medical history of former patients at the Stanley Royd Hospital - part of West Rising Pauper Asylym - has been added to the National Register of Documentary Heritage

The records feature photographs of those admitted to the institution between 1814 and 1991 (pictured)

One patient in the collection is Ann Humphries (left) -  a carpet weaver who was admitted on 9 May 1871, aged 53, having thrown herself into the canal at Walton, Yorkshire. Another is schoolboy Alfred Todd (right) of Wakefield - who was diagnosed of 'imbecility with epilepsy' and thought his name was 'broken window'

The programme is an online catalogue created to help promote the UK’s 
documentary heritage across the UK and the world.

One
 of the first such institutions in the UK, the West Riding Pauper Asylum
 opened its first hospital - The Stanley Royd - in 1818.

The three others are South Yorkshire Asylum, High Royds Hospital, and Storthes Hall.

Archivist
 David Morris, from WYAS, said: 'The records on West Riding Pauper 
Asylum, Stanley Royd, are studied by professionals coming from all over 
the UK and abroad.

'The 
data on these records goes back nearly 200 years and provides a 
reflection of how mental illness and treatments have developed over 
time.

The former asylum (pictured) is now a residential development in Wakefield. It was one of the first asylums to be opened in the UK in 1818 and has been hailed as a pioneering institution in the field of mental health

An early drawing of the Asylum shows the grounds and main hospital buildings. An archivist said today the collection 'provides a reflection of how mental illness and treatments have developed over time'

'They were seen as pioneers of such methods as electrical stimulation therapy and physical restraint.'

The
 collection, which is hailed as one of the most important in the 
country, has been recognised as being of unique significance and an 
irreplaceable source for the medical and social heritage.

At
 the heart of the collection are the patients’ records, recording, in 
intimate and extensive detail, the admission, family and social 
background, illnesses, treatment, and ultimate fate of the thousands of 
men, women and children who passed through the doors of Stanley Royd 
over the course of 173 years.

Another patient's case notes, including a photograph. The collection includes over 5000 photographs of patients from the late 1860s onwards - putting a face to thousands of the patient numbers

The
 collection includes over 5000 photographs of patients from the late 
1860s onwards, putting a face to thousands of the patient numbers.

One of which was Mary Manning, a Bradford domestic servant, who was admitted in 1880.

She claimed to be the 'Queen of heaven, possessed of great wealth and had been crowned'.

One of the patients was Ann Humphreys, pictured, from Dewsbury, who was a carpet weaver. She was admitted on 9 May 1871, aged 53, having thrown herself into the canal at Walton. 

She nearly died but was resuscitated. During her imprisonment at the Court House she tried to strangle herself twice.

Both her mother and sister had been classed as insane and were in Durham County Asylum. Ann has suffered from epileptic fits for 26 years. She worked in the Potato Kitchen, and was still in the Asylum in 1890 when she died.

Another was Mary Manning, a Bradford domestic servant, admitted in 1880. She claimed to be the 'Queen of heaven, possessed of great wealth and had been crowned'

Sarah Drabble of Wortley aged 37 with 18 children was admitted in 1832 for 'feeling in a low despondent state ever since her confinement'.

Mary Ellen Yates, a Leeds housewife, was admitted in 1887 due to insufficient food and mistreatment by her husband.

Children were also taken in to the asylum - including Alfred Todd of Wakefield, West Yorkshire, who was diagnosed of 'imbecility with epilepsy'. The remarks made on his treatment include
 an answer to questions regarding name and age, which he replied 'broken
 window' and on asking him names of surrounding objects he replies 
'Alfey'.

Others
 case files show patients were suffering from general health problems 
such as symptoms which would be recognised today as post-natal 
depression.

Sarah Drabble of Wortley was admitted in 1832, aged 37 with 18 children.

She was not surprisingly 'feeling in a low despondent state ever since her confinement'.

Other women were suffering from social problems, including Mary Ellen Yates, a Leeds housewife, who was admitted in 1887 due to insufficient food and mistreatment by her husband.

Children were admitted into the hospital from as early as 1820 and until the opening of the separate Stanley Hall facility in 1901.

Examples from the Stanley Hall era include Alfred Todd of Wakefield, West Yorkshire, who was diagnosed of 'imbecility with epilepsy'.

The remarks made on his treatment include an answer to questions regarding name and age, which he replied 'broken window' and on asking him names of surrounding objects he replies 'Alfey'.

Another mother of an 11-year-old Leeds boy in 1911, said: 'I cannot manage him. He is destructive, breaks and tears everything he can get to lay his hands on.

'I am obliged to keep knives out of his way and all windows closed. Children in the neighbourhood are afraid of him.'

Mr Morris said: 'What was so unique about this asylum was the fact it was a pauper asylum.

'This meant they would take in anyone, which means both short and long-term patients were based there.

'The records also highlight how the treatment and attitude to mental health has changed throughout the years.

'One of the most notable changes is looking at the language staff would use towards patients, which we would not use now.

'For example, words like ‘Imbecile’ are used to describe some patients.'

The
 award for ‘Best of UK Heritage’ recognises the outstanding but 
lesser-known heritage of the UK. Only nine UK collections have been 
successful this year.

This 
is the second collection held by WYAS to receive a UNESCO award, with 
the diaries of Anne Lister 1806-1840, held at WYAS, Calderdale gaining 
the accolade in 2011.

A collection of 130 ancient ‘curse stones’ featuring gruesome messages of revenge from Roman times have been added to a world heritage register.

The stones - known as ‘curse tablets’ - had messages scrawled into them by people who had been wronged before being tossed into the hallowed spring waters in Bath, Somerset.

The authors would pour bile on their enemies and called for revenge in the most gruesome ways.

A collection of 130 ancient 'curse stones' (pictured) featuring gruesome message of revenge written by people wishing revenge on their enemies has also been added to the UNESCO heritage register

One calls for an adversary’s intestines to be 'quite eaten away', while another seeks revenge for the theft of a bronze vessel and asks it be filled with the blood of the thief.

Another is written in British Celtic - the only text known to survive in that language - while one tablet contains the earliest known use of the word Christian in Britain.

The curses, which date back between the second and fourth century AD, are written in Latin to the goddess Sulis Minerva and inscribed on small sheets of lead or pewter.

They were then case into the hot springs at Bath, where a they were left for the goddess.

One person writes on their curse stone that a thief who stole their gloves should 'lose their eyes and minds'

Now 130 of the artefacts unearthed at the Roman Baths have been deemed to precious they have been added to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) Memory of the World register of outstanding documentary heritage.

They are the only objects from Roman Britain to have been inscribed on the Unesco Memory of the World UK register.

Many of the curses have been translated from their original Latin and reveal that not only were Bath’s Romans creative in their requests for revenge, but were also very specific.

One person asked that a thief who had stolen their gloves should go mad and blind, saying: 'Docimedis has lost two gloves and asks that the thief responsible should lose their minds and eyes in the goddess’ temple.'

While another person wrote: 'May he who carried off Vilbia from me become liquid as the water. May she who so obscenely devoured her become dumb'

There was also a tendency for particularly gory punishments for the guilty, including a curse about a stolen ring.

The aggrieved victim said: '..so long as someone, whether slave or free, keeps silent or knows anything about it, he may be accursed in (his) blood, and eyes and every limb and even have all (his) intestines quite eaten away if he has stolen the ring or been privy (to the theft).'

Councillor Ben Stevens, Bath and North East Somerset Council’s cabinet member for sustainable development, accepted the certificate of inscription on behalf of the local authority.

He said: 'The decision by Unesco to inscribe the Roman curse tablets from Bath on the Memory of the World register reflects the very special nature of this collection, and is another reason for local people to take pride in the exceptional quality of our local heritage here in B&NES.'

The messages were then thrown in to the hallowed spring waters in Bath, Somerset pictured. The stones were unearthed at the Roman Baths and are currently kept at the attraction
