Movie rental firm Blockbuster  collapsed into administration yesterday, putting more than 4,000 jobs  at risk as the crisis on the High Street deepened.

The UK arm of the American entertainment firm, which has 528 stores in Britain, joined music group HMV and photography specialist Jessops on the list of failed retailers.

In a desperate seven days for the High Street, the total number of jobs facing the axe reached more than 10,000. Also yesterday, Orange and T-Mobile operator EE announced plans to close 78 stores. And fashion brand Gio-Goi, popular with celebrities, has appointed KPMG as administrator.

Blockbuster has lurched from crisis to crisis as habits have changed, with people increasingly opting to download movies over the internet rather than visit its shops.

It finally bowed to the inevitable yesterday, appointing accountant Deloitte, which is also acting as administrator to HMV, to try to find a buyer. All stores will remain open for the time being and, unlike HMV, Blockbuster will continue to honour vouchers and credit notes.

Deloitte partner Lee Manning believes Blockbuster has a future, but with fewer stores.

Britain’s battered High Street has been hit hard by spiralling rent costs and other bills. Cash-strapped consumers have reined in spending on all but the most essential of items as sweeping austerity measures take their toll. Electrical chain Comet pulled down the shutters just before Christmas, and Aquascutum, Clinton Cards and JJB Sports all ran into trouble last year.

In London: It is the latest firm to see its business slip away to online retailers, such as Netflix and Amazon¿s LoveFilm, which allow customers to have films, games and music posted to their home or live-streamed online

In Newcastle: Blockbuster UK's demise comes amid dire warnings for Britain's retailers this year. More stores are expected to go bust following a Christmas that saw families tightening their belts and spending less money on the High Street

Some experts have been surprised that Blockbuster continued to survive for so long. In the US it collapsed into administration in 2011 but was bought by satellite broadcaster Dish Network which has kept the business going there.

Blockbuster dominated the UK film rental market in the 1980s and still has two million regular customers, with sales of £182million for the year to December.

But poor trading over Christmas meant it posted a £300,000 loss rather than the £4.5million profit expected.

Customers have been renting fewer DVDs because of the popularity of rival mail order business LOVEFiLM, now owned by Amazon, streaming site Netflix and TV movie channels.

Business experts said Blockbuster, like other retailers, had failed to adapt quickly enough to changing consumer habits.

Dr Steve Musson, of the University of Reading, added: ‘Rents for retail businesses are usually payable quarterly, with many landlords most recently asking for payment at the end of December, which is why we often see retail failures coming in clusters.’

Business recovery specialist Begbies 
Traynor said 140 UK retailers are on its ‘critical’ watchlist. Its 
research highlighted more than 13,700 retailers experiencing 
‘significant’ distress in the 11 weeks to December 17, 2012, a 35 per 
cent increase from the third quarter.

The
78 store closures announced by EE are in towns where the group 
inherited more than one shop from the 2010 merger of Orange and  
T-Mobile.

More than 500 customer service staff will be redeployed to other branches, but the store managers could face losing their jobs.

Latest casualty: Blockbuster is the latest high street casualty and follows HMV which also called in administrators this week

Blockbuster UK's announcement that it has gone into administration makes it the latest in a long line of high-profile high street firms to fail - the most visible legacy of the financial crisis and subsequent double-dip recession.December 2008: MFI, the furniture retailer, was one of the first major firms to go out of business at the start of the downturn, as retail sales began to fall following a sharp rise in unemploymentWoolworthsJanuary 2009: Woolworths shuttered its 800 stores, bringing home to many the scale of the UK's economic collapse as the country entered recession for the first timeFebruary 2009: Zavvi stopped trading around Christmas - and refused to honour its gift cards, leading to widespread customer angerBordersDecember 2009: Borders was another entertainment behemoth to go under as sale of CDs and DVDs were squeezed by digital downloads and online retailersOctober 2012: JJB Sports closed all but 20 of its stores, which were taken over and re-branded by Sports Direct - leading to the death of the JJB brand and 550 employees losing their jobs

Casualty of 2012: Comet was one of several household names that went into administration last year

December 2012: Comet shut down just before Christmas, leaving nearly 7,000 staff out of work and forcing the taxpayer to pick up a £50million tab related to its bankruptcy, which was blamed on soaring energy prices and a reduction in the number of home buyersJanuary 2013: Jessops was closed by administrator PwC earlier this month after years of struggling with online competition as customers turned away from traditional photographyJanuary 2013: HMV, which has 239 shops and 4,500 staff, announced that it was calling in administrators. The company came under fire for not honouring gift vouchers which they had been selling all over Christmas.NEXT? Past Times, Blacks and Hawkin's Bazaar are among the many other firms which have entered administration but been able to survive in some form. However, as the economic recovery remains fragile these companies could tip back into serious trouble.

Loophole: Amazon made £3.35 billion in sales in Britain in 2011, thanks in part to the fact that its headquarters are based in tax-friendly Luxembourg, allowing it to pay just £1.8million in tax

Blockbuster UK adds its name to the long 
list of household names that have entered administration in recent years
as struggling families cut down on spending.

The number of High Street chains
going bust has increased by almost a
fifth in two years, figures released last week showed.

Some 194 stores and chains fell into
administration during 2012, compared
to 183 in 2011 and 165 during 2010,
according to data from Deloitte.

Casualties: Last year saw the demise of La 
Senza, left, and Comet, right, among others, as struggling families cut 
down on their spending during 2012

On Tuesday, entertainment giant HMV went bust following on from camera retailer Jessops just days earlier.

Last year saw the demise of Comet,
La Senza and Clinton Cards, with JJB Sports, Blacks and Game also entering administration.

But the number going under in the run-up to Christmas dropped, with 37 chains folding in the final three months of 2012, compared with 42 in the same period in 2011.
