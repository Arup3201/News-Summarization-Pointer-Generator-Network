Commons Speaker John Bercow faced a crisis last night after the leak of a bombshell Downing Street email denouncing his ‘bizarre’ decision to give an Australian woman a £200,000-a-year Parliamentary post.

Mr Bercow’s determination to give Australian official Carol Mills the powerful job of Commons Clerk has sparked an all-party revolt.

He has been accused of a ‘politically correct’ stunt – and trying to use manager Ms Mills’s inexperience in Parliamentary debates to grab more power for himself.

'Less stuffy': The determination of Commons Speaker John Bercow (left) to give Australian official Carol Mills (right) the powerful job of Commons Clerk has sparked an all-party revolt 

The dispute took an extraordinary turn last night after one of Ms Mills’s senior colleagues at the Australian Senate effectively branded her unfit to do the job.

Rosemary Laing, Clerk at the Australian Senate – the equivalent of the post planned for Ms Mills – said the ‘embarrassing’ appointment was ‘an affront’.

The onslaught came in an email widely circulated in Westminster, including No 10, and obtained by  this newspaper.

The dispute threatened to turn into a major row as it emerged:

* Outgoing Commons Clerk Sir  Robert Rogers, allegedly told to ‘f*** off’ by Mr Bercow, kept a sensational secret diary of the Speaker’s outbursts.

* The Queen risked being dragged into the row amid reports David Cameron is ready to refuse to send the appointment to the Palace for Royal approval.

* MPs’ calls for a vote to overturn the Speaker’s choice of Ms Mills were backed by ministers.

* Male officials rejected in favour of Ms Mills may sue Mr Bercow for sex discrimination.

The row comes after widely respected Parliamentary traditionalist Sir Robert resigned after a series of clashes with the Speaker.

Ms Mills is currently head of the Department of Parliamentary Services (DPS) of the Australian Senate in Canberra, responsible for everything from cleaning to catering, not debates, leading Westminster wags to call her ‘the Canberra Caterer’.

Mr Bercow reportedly sees her as a ‘less stuffy’ replacement and part of his drive to ‘modernise’ Parliament. But critics claim it is a secret power grab because she will be  unable to challenge his rulings.

Their claims are reinforced in the email sent last week by Ms Laing, who works closely with Ms Mills. She said: ‘We were utterly taken aback when we heard Carol Mills was front-runner to replace Sir  Robert Rogers and have followed events with disbelief and dismay.

‘It seems impossible someone without parliamentary knowledge and experience could be under consideration for such a role. It is bizarre and an affront.

‘Carol comes from the state public service. It is not simple to move to serving Parliament if there is a lack of understanding of Parliament.’

Ms Laing echoes MPs who say Mr Bercow would ride roughshod over Ms Mills. ‘DPS heads [such as Mills] have a lack of appreciation and respect for MPs and senators and an over-emphasis on the authority of Presiding Officers [such as Bercow].’

Referring to claims that Ms Mills’s department used CCTV to spy on the office of an Australian senator, Ms Laing said: ‘I was surprised a resignation did not follow.’ She backed calls for MPs to quiz Ms Mills before she becomes Commons Clerk and Chief Executive.

It would be ‘enormously embarrassing,’ said Ms Laing. She added:  ‘The only thing more embarrassing would be to make the proposed appointment.’

Sir Robert refused to comment on claims that he had kept a diary of the volatile Speaker’s tantrums and alleged four-letter outbursts.

A well-placed source said: ‘Robert could see the writing on the wall and took the necessary precautions.’

Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said: ‘It would be wrong for the Queen to approve this appointment before MPs have been fully consulted.’

But last night, the Speaker refused to back down, insisting via a spokeswoman that Ms Mills’s appointment was ‘open and fair’. She insisted the choice was a ‘collective decision’ by the six-strong Commons interview panel, including Mr Bercow.
