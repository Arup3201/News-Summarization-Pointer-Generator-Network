Two teenagers accused of feeding a live cat to two dogs, videotaping the attack and posting it online have been arrested in central California on suspicion of cruelty to an animal.

The Bakersfield Californian reports that while the incident apparently occurred over the summer, Animal Control wasn't contacted until December 4 after a person reported receiving the graphic video on a social networking site.

After reviewing the videotape, Animal Control staff contacted the Kern County Sheriff’s Office and requested the Sheriff’s Office investigate the incident.

Brutal attack: Detectives arrested a 15-year-old and a 17-year-old last week for feeding a cat to two live dogs (not pictured), filming it, and putting it online 

Sheriff's deputies said the video appeared to show two large dogs being fed a live cat while voices in the background encouraged the dogs to attack.

Detectives arrested a 15-year-old and a 17-year-old last week. Both teens were booked into Juvenile Hall.

Because the suspects are minors their identities have been protected and have not been made public at this time. 

ABC reports that the teen suspects were allegedly the ones who both recorded the video and who were encouraging the dogs to kill the cat.

Anyone with more information regarding the incident is asked to call  the Sheriff's Office at 861-3110 or Secret Witness at 322-4040.

Booked: The teens aged 15 and 17 were booked in Juvenile Hall on suspicion of animal cruelty
