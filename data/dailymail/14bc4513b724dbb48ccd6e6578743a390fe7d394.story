Sensible: International Development Secretary Justine Greening defended giving aid to Nigeria, which has launched a space programme

Britain giving millions of pounds to Nigeria while it embarks on a space programme is a ‘sensible investment’, the government insisted today.

The oil-rich country, which has accepted £300million from Britain in aid this year alone, has set in train ambitious plans to launch its own rockets and even put a man into space.

But International Development Secretary Justine Greening was backed by Downing Street after arguing that it was money ‘well spent’ by Nigeria.

However a Department for International Development spokesman was keen to stress to MailOnline that Britain is 'not providing any aid funds to Nigeria’s space programme'.

The first Nigerian astronauts are being trained to join Russian, Chinese or American missions within the next two years.

At the same time the UK taxpayer is sending £1.14billion in foreign aid to the country over the five years of the Coalition.

The revelation sparked a storm of protest last week, coming after UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom accused the government of ‘treason’ for sending billions in aid to ‘Bongo Bongo land’ while making cuts to police and social services at home.

But Ms Greening insisted the foreign aid sent to Nigeria would ‘help Nigeria progress and develop as a country’.

She told BBC Radio 4: ‘I believe it is being well spent but we obviously have to make sure that we critically assess the projects underway.

‘We do expect them to invest in their country as well. The so-called space programme was in fact investment in satellites, weather satellites and for communication.

‘So actually this investment that they’re making in the so called "space programme" which is actually satellite technology, some of which is actually has been provided by UK companies based in Surrey, is a sensible investment and actually one that we would be expecting them to be making alongside the investment that we make.’

Nigeria’s space programme started in 2003 but its first satellite lost power and disappeared from orbit.

It now has three in space, NigComSat-1R, NigeriaSat-2 and Nigeria-Sat X, the first to be constructed by Nigerian engineers.

Although it has bought its own 
satellites and launched on Russian rockets, Nigeria has built 
laboratories which it hopes will produce its own space craft by 2028.

The
National Space Research and Development Agency confirmed Nigerian 
astronauts should be trained and ready for space travel within two 
years.

Big spending: Nigeria has already launched these surveillance rockets from Russia as part of its plans to join the space race

In July this 
year, NASRDA’s director general, Professor Seidu Onailo Mohammed, 
declared: ‘By our road map we are supposed to have astronauts prepared 
by 2015. Before the end of the year, the recruitment of astronauts will 
begin so that we have them handy and as soon as we get the nod we can 
pick from that number.’

Critics last week asked why Britain 
was, in effect, subsidising a space programme for a nation where 70 per 
cent of people live below the poverty line.

The £1.14billion Nigeria will receive
over the five years of the Coalition is double the £500million set 
aside to prop up struggling accident and emergency departments at our 
own hospitals.

Backbench
Tory MP Philip Davies said it was ‘totally unjustifiable and 
unaffordable’ for Britain to give this money to Nigeria, given the scale
of its ‘grandiose’ space programme.

‘We cannot go around the world saying “don’t worry, we will feed your public for you while you waste your money on all sorts of other projects”,’ he said.

‘We have got to say to these countries “you have got to spend that money on your people where it’s most needed not on some grandiose space programme”. We are against welfare dependency at home but at the same time we are encouraging welfare dependency abroad.’

The row surrounding Mr Bloom flared when he insisted that sending aid to Africa was tantamount to treason.

He added: ‘How we can possibly be giving a billion pounds a month, when we’re in this sort of debt, to Bongo Bongo land is completely beyond me.’

He claimed foreign leaders frittered the money away on ‘Ray-Ban sunglasses, apartments in Paris and Ferraris’.

Poverty: Millions of Nigerians are living in poverty, despite the country earning huge profits from its oil deposits

Resources: Nigeria generates millions in oil revenue every year but much of the population lives in poverty

The Department for International 
Development’s budget is rising by 35 per cent in real terms by 2015. But
while aid costs are ballooning, spending on the military, the police, 
border control and care homes is being slashed.

Britain
is also spending about £280million a year on aid to India, another 
country with its own space programme.

Debate: UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom has reignited the issue of Britain's foreign aid contributions with his infamous 'bongo bongo land' comments

Despite Nigeria having the 
second-highest national income of all African countries, most of its 
people still live in poverty. It is also mired in corruption.

The most 
modest estimates suggest between £2.5 and £5billion is stolen from the 
state’s coffers every year by corrupt officials and politicians.

Jonathan Isaby from the TaxPayers’ 
Alliance, said: ‘When budgets are tight both for families and the 
Government alike, people cannot understand why ministers are sending 
more and more of our hard-earned cash overseas.

‘Taxpayers
find it especially unacceptable when their money is sent abroad as aid 
to developing countries which then somehow find sufficient cash to fund 
the likes of a space programme.

‘It
is totally unacceptable that British taxpayers’ money is effectively 
subsidising Nigeria’s efforts to send an astronaut into space.’

The
Nigerian government has not released detailed figures on how much it is
spending on its space programme, but it is thought to be hundreds of 
millions of pounds a year.

British aid to Nigeria will increase by 116 
per cent under the Coalition government, from £141million in 2010/11 to 
£305million in 2014/15. It amounts to a total of £1.14billion over five 
years.

The country has also been criticised for failing to crack down on corruption. The only senior figure from Nigeria to have been prosecuted over corruption in recent years was jailed by a British court.

James Ibori, the former governor of the country’s oil-rich Delta state, was sentenced to 13 years for money laundering, forgery and fraud totalling nearly £50million. He used the money to live a lavish lifestyle, buying a house in London worth £2.25million and luxury cars worth over £650,000.

Last night a spokesman for the Department for International Development said spending aid money in Nigeria would help cut crime and illegal immigration in Britain.

‘No UK aid money goes through the Nigerian government,’ she said. ‘Our investment goes into specific health, education and poverty reduction programmes. Nigeria is home to a quarter of the poorest people in Africa, and supporting their development will benefit our own trade and security.’
