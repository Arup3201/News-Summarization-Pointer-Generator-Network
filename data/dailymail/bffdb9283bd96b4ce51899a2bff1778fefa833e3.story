Death: An inquest jury found Mark Duggan was lawfully killed, sparking anger among his supporters

The angry mob who ran amok after the Mark Duggan inquest will face no charges, a senior officer revealed last night.

Supporters of the gangster hurled abuse and threats inside and outside the court last week after a jury returned a verdict of lawful killing.

Yesterday, MPs questioned whether failing to take legal action against those responsible for the ‘hail of spittle and abuse’ would ‘bring the law and police enforcement into disrepute’.

But Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley told Westminster’s Home Affairs committee ‘emotions’ had been running high after the verdict and he did not plan to pursue ‘every minor offence’.

Only a single incident of throwing a missile outside the court is being investigated.

Supporters of father-of-six Duggan reacted furiously after a jury ruled he was lawfully killed by police officers who stopped his taxi in August 2011. His death sparked days of riots in London and other cities and police fear further disorder following the verdict.

After a three-month inquest, the jury decided last Wednesday that Duggan was unarmed when he was killed but police were right to use lethal force.

There were cries of ‘murderers’ from the public gallery and abuse was aimed at jurors. Outbursts continued in the corridors of the Royal Courts of Justice and some supporters smashed a door.

Outside, Mr Rowley struggled to be heard on the steps of the court as the crowd shouted ‘murdering scum’. He admitted that some jurors had felt threatened, saying: ‘The intensity of emotion was of concern to some of them.’ But he said no arrests would be made in relation to scenes inside the court.

The officer said the Coroner had raised no prospect of action for contempt of court.

But Tory MP Mark Reckless asked: ‘Is there not a requirement to be seen to uphold the law? If people see on their TV screens an officer being spat at and no action is taken, does that not bring the law and police enforcement into disrepute?’

Mr Rowley said he had never before faced such a ‘hail of spittle and abuse’ but added: ‘The shouting and the spitting – we left it. I am not going to follow up every minor offence. I was the prime victim.’

He criticised ‘some public figures [who] have questioned the jury’s verdict’ – an apparent reference to Labour MP Diane Abbott, who called the conclusion ‘baffling’.

The officer revealed that some gangsters had ‘chanced their luck’ after the verdict, believing the Met would go soft on gun crime. ‘They were wrong and some will go to prison as a result,’ Mr Rowley said.

He added that the Met will have a senior officer in charge of ‘community relations’ by the end of the week.
