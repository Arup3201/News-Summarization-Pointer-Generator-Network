Harold Shipman murdered between 215 and 250 of his patients over a 27 year period

An investigation has been launched into whether police officers misled the families of Harold Shipman's victims over the disposal their loved ones' remains.

Human tissue from 12 of the sick serial killer's victims were kept for more than a decade by Greater Manchester Police (GMP) before allegedly being secretly destroyed, without permission from their families.

In response to the allegations, made by a whistleblower currently working within the force, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has launched a probe into the actions of GMP officers surrounding the disposal of the remains.

The samples were taken from the 12 
victims to ensure police had the appropriate evidence should Shipman or 
his family appeal against his conviction.

However, in 2011, police decided to 'respectfully dispose' of the tissue samples without telling the families of the victims.

The
 remains reportedly belonged to Kathleen Grundy, Joan Melia, Winifred 
Mellor, Bianka Pomfret, Ivy Lomas, Marie Quinn, Irene Turner, Jean 
Lilley, Muriel Grimshaw, Alice Kitchen, Elizabeth Mellor and Sally 
Ashworth.

Officers whose actions will be investigated range from the rank of constable up to Greater Manchester Police Assistant Chief Constable Terry Sweeney.

Mr Sweeney had been seconded to work on Operation Resolve, the police investigation into the Hillsborough disaster, but has now returned to GMP.

Sir Peter Fahy, GMP chief constable, said: 'I have stated before that the decisions dealing with the aftermath of the Shipman investigation were complex and sensitive, our priority was to avoid causing further distress to the families.

'Assistant Chief Constable Terry Sweeney has voluntarily decided to stand down from his work with the Hillsborough Inquiry as part of Operation Resolve while the investigation takes place.

'This is a personal decision made as he does not want the matter to distract from the operationâ€™s important work.

'I support the need for difficult issues we face to be subjected to scrutiny and for there to be a transparent process for this.'

Assistant Chief Constable Terry Sweeney is to be questioned by the IPCC regarding his alleged involvement with the disposal of the remains

He added: 'These are serious allegations but this investigation will not distract us from the hard work of officers and staff every day who are keeping the public safe and tackling criminals.'

The whistleblower has levelled a string of other serious allegations against GMP, including claims of corruption, 'cronyism' among senior officers and failures to follow procedure or fully investigate complaints.

The watchdog is launching a total of three investigations based on the whistleblower's claims.

The first will look into the disposal of Shipman's victims' remains, while a second will assess accusations made against a Detective Chief Inspector, including the alleged unauthorised bugging of a GMP office. The force has told the IPCC that this bugging did not take place.

A third probe will also address claims that a sexual abuse case was poorly handled and then the alleged failings covered up.

IPCC commissioner Jan Williams said: 'These are serious allegations and the gravity and nature of the allegations, and the fact that they are made against senior officers within the force, means they must be investigated independently.

'We will also look at the wider organisational response by Greater Manchester Police in each of these investigations.

'We know that the families involved will have been through very distressing times, and we will be sensitive to this as we conduct our investigations.

'We have a statutory duty to conduct independent investigations in circumstances such as these, but we will make sure that we communicate with the families and do whatever we can to avoid further distress.'

Shipman never expressed remorse for his crimes

Twisted GP Harold Shipman is the UK's most prolific convicted serial killer, having murdered up to 250 of his patients during a 27-year period stretching from 1971.

He preyed on the vulnerable and his victims tended to be elderly women living alone.

Their ages ranged form 41 to 93 and the murders were mostly committed during home visits, usually with a lethal injection of the painkiller diamorphine.

In 2000, Shipman was given 15 life sentences after being found guilty of murdering 15 patients while working in Hyde, Greater Manchester.

Throughout his three month trial, Shipman never took responsibility for his crimes, nor gave any clues as to his motivations.

Four years later, at the age of 57, he killed himself in his cell in Wakefield Prison, hanging himself with his bedsheets.
