I've been given a deadline of September 6 to get back to Men's Health cover shape.

Back in December last year I got into my best shape ever and made the cover of the top fitness magazine, weighing in a 12st 8lbs and 8 per cent body fat. I was ripped.

I am far from that now (13st 6lbs and 15 per cent body fat), and this week I was told I've got a very revealing photo and video shoot at the beginning of next month that's going to have nationwide exposure. If I'm flabby and out of shape then it's going to be on show for all to see.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO 

Back in shape: Spencer has been working with Shaun Stafford to get fit for his latest shoot

No pressure then – but at least I've got a deadline I suppose.

I've got a four point game plan to reach the target

1. Minimum five gym sessions per week, with top trainer Shaun Stafford at City Athletic Gym.

2. Take three Forza T5 Super Strength every day to boost fat burning, add energy and stop snacking

3. Eat clean and low carbs

4. No more booze and late nights.

Booze is the killer for any weight-loss regime. I love a glass of red wine but it's 250 calories – that's 20 minutes running a swift pace on the treadmill. I have to remind myself of that every time I think about having a snifter.

Going that extra mile: Spencer has only got until September to get back into shape 

Dedication: Spencer has been avoiding both alcohol and carbs in order to maintain his fitness

If you have a large night out, not only have you put away 2,000 calories of booze you also set your body metabolism back a day – you can't work out on a hangover (well, I wouldn't advise it). Your body is working hard to detox itself and you can't change your body shape in that state.

First session back with Shaun Stafford this week was pretty grim. He was especially hard on me because I'd cancelled a session at the last minute earlier in the week – it was the day after my birthday, can't he give a guy a break?

Anyway, he warned me it would be a punishing schedule, so I popped two Forza T5 Super Strength tablets just before I got changed. They take a couple of minutes to kick in and then I was fired up for a hard session.

Feeling the strain? Spencer says that his workout with Shaun is no walk in the park

Practice makes perfect: Spencer works up a sweat with a kettlebell

One quick point before we start on the work out – there is no easy way of doing this. Some very rare people enjoy going to the gym, I'm not one of them but I do enjoy the results - being fitter, healthier, and looking good naked.

If you want to see a difference you have to work hard for 50 minutes in the gym, a few times a week and really push yourself. OK, rant over, now carry on.

Giant Volume Training

We started with something Shaun calls Giant Volume Training – circuit training type exercises that work big muscle groups in top and lower body and burn a lot of calories and get the blood pumping. You can see from the look on my face in the pictures that it's not entirely fun.

Spencer says he was in his best shape in December last year, however he has since gained almost a stone

Then it's 10 squats, 10 flat bench presses, 10 x prone dumb bell rows, 10 x kettle bell swings. Only rest for the time it takes you to walk from one exercise to the next, then take one minute rest at the end of each full set of four.

We did 10 of these sets – and I was shattered.

But it wasn't over – punishment for cancelling the day after my birthday came next.

Metabolic Conditioning

Metabolic conditioning is the fancy name for rolling a big 80kg tire six times and then pushing it back. Thirty seconds rest, then do it again, and again. Shaun made me do it five times and I thought I was going to be sick.

Then it was time for the battle ropes. Five reps of that and I was finished.

I work it out that I've got another 15 of these torture sessions to go before I'm ready. They won't get any easier but hopefully I won't feel quite so nauseous at the end of them as time goes by.

Lots of love,
