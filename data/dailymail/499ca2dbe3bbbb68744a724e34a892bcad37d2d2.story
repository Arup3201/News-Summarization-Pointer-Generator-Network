Two fishermen were left stranded after a strong tidal current pulled their vehicle, boat and trailer  into the crocodile infested creek.

The men were trying to recover their boat at the ramp  after returning from an evening fishing trip at Buffalo Creek Boat Ramp in Darwin's northern suburbs on Sunday.

One reversed the boat trailer down the ramp while the other waited in the boat.

But the driver had left the 2012 Nissan Navara four-wheel drive ute in neutral with the handbrake on as he got out and the car and trailer were pulled down the ramp and into the water.

With the ongoing current, the vehicle and trailer were taken downstream and swept through the inhabit area of salt water crocodiles.

Casuarina Police, who were patrolling the area at the time, were flagged down by the hapless men shortly before 2am.

When police arrived, the vehicle had travelled about 50 metres away from the boat ramp with just the roof of the ute visible above the surface while the trailer had submerged.

A Northern Territory police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia that the owner is recovering his vehicle and trailer on Monday but could not confirm how he was going to retrieve it.

The men were taken home by police after they were unable to recover the stricken vehicle and trailer but the pair has since recovered their boat after borrowing a friend's trailer.

Police said one of the officers who attended the incident, jokingly told the fishermen that the accident could have been prevented if they owned a Toyota Hilux instead of a Navara.

Water police attended the area on Monday morning and attached a buoyant to act as a warning to people in the area to avoid the submerged car and trailer as it could pose as a navigational hazard.

Police said the location was known for its strong tidal currents and salt water crocodiles and urged residents to take extra care and vigilance when launching and recovering  vessel in Territory waters.
