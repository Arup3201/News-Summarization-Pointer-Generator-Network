'It doesn't matter how old you are,' says Glam Xpress make-up artist Sandra Hadi. 'Anyone and everyone can wear it.'

For those not up to speed with Japanese 
teen trends, Kawaii is all about looking hyper-cute, doll-like even, and
it's fast becoming popular here - both with teens and older women.

But I'm not convinced. I'm at the Hyper Japan show in London's Earl's Court being transformed into a 'Kawaii' girl, which in my case, means lashings of glitter, a pink wig and a frilly dress of the sort Grayson Perry would be proud of. It's certainly not my usual look.

The antithesis of fake-tanned hair-extensioned TOWIE chic, Kawaii girls like pink, kitsch, tutus, delicate dabs of glitter, enormous false lashes and ultra pale skin.

The most common Kawaii style is named the 'classic Lolita', which despite referencing the Nabokov novel in the name, has nothing to do with looking sexy and everything to do with achieving a look that is as cute, girlish and pretty as possible.

Based on frilled and furbelowed Victorian styles combined with a hint of goth, girls hope to achieve a porcelain-doll look using lashings of lace, ribbon, bows, ruffles, bloomers, aprons, and ruffled petticoats.

Then there's the 'Sweet Lolita' look. Featuring even more ribbons, bows, and lace, than the 'Classic Lolita', it leaves out the gothic elements in favour of pastels.

Fairy Kei is also popular and involves giant bow headdresses or bonnets, teamed with lighter, less extreme make-up.

Not surprisingly, the prettiness of Kawaii has won it legions of fans among British teens - many of whom have turned up at Hyper Japan, pretty in their lilac wigs and supersized falsies.

At 28, I'm more than a decade older than most of them, and at 5ft 8", considerably taller to boot. I don't wear pink and I certainly don't do wacky wigs.

Nevertheless, Sandra, and her colleague Tamara, are confident that it won't take much to turn me into a fully fledged Kawaii girl.

We kick off with make-up. Lots of make-up. As I'm going to be a Sweet Lolita, that means a fresh-looking pale base and lots of pink blusher.

Then there's my eyes which get several washes of pink eyeshadow, black and white liner and a frosting of glitter.

Then Tamara takes over to add false lashes so heavy, my eyes semi-close followed by tiny diamante hearts at the corners of my eyes and dotted along my lashline.

But make-up alone just isn't enough, so I'm whisked away to be fitted up for a wig. The wig they choose is bright bubblegum pink and comes with detachable bunches. Like the falsies, it's heavy.

Finally, we go hunting for a dress. The one Tamara eventually picks is - of course - bright pink and comes with a sash, a tutu and a frilly lace neckline.

Crazy: Without the wig, the Kawaii look is prettier, and according to Sandra, is great for evenings out

Fully dressed, I survey myself in a 
mirror held up by Tamara and barely recognise myself. I look like a 
cross between Grayson Perry and a toddler. It's fun but I'm not 
convinced this is the look for me so I take it outside for a second 
opinion.

On the way out, I'm stopped by a 
woman on her way into the show. 'I just love your look,' she smiles. 'I 
think you're very brave.'

Then I find a pair of workmen, who break into smirks as I approach. 'What do you think?' I ask, giving them a twirl.

'You look great, love,' says one smiling kindly at me. 'Speak for yourself!' sniggers his friend. Hmmm - not quite the reaction I was hoping for.

Back inside, I meet pint-sized J-Pop duo, Yanakiku. Dressed in elaborate mini-kimonos teamed with clompy boots and twirling feathery fans, to my untrained eyes, the pair have a Kawaii-esque look themselves.

As soon as I walk through the door, they're exclaiming about by enormous eyelashes. 'Your lashes are so cool!' they chorus.

They too are very cool, their diminutive frames proving the perfect foil for their quirky-cool look which, they tell me, isn't Kawaii but another style sub-set called 'kimono cosplay', which involves Anime cartoon inspired clothes made with kimono fabric.

By now, my hairline is becoming itchy thanks to the wig, so I wave goodbye to Yana and Kiku and head back to Sandra and Tamara to hand back my Kawaii get-up.

Relieved of my wig and dress, I instantly feel better, strolling round to see Hyper Japan's sushi stalls and geisha performances without feeling like a goth at a football match.

So could I be a Kawaii girl? While I learned to love my pink blusher and eyeshadow and enjoyed pirouetting around in glitter galore, it's just too girly and I'm definitely too old.

What looks sweet on a teenager looks babyish on me, so I'll be giving the frills and furbelows a miss along with the heavy, luridly coloured wigs.

Madly creative and very, very pretty, Kawaii isn't great for the over-20s but looks gorgeous on girls.

Kawaii, which translates as 'adorable', is a Japanese sub-culture which places emphasis on being as cute as possible.

Although the best known aspect of Kawaii is the kitsch fashion, Kawaii girls and boys also apply the concept to the way they live and behave.

While it looks similar to other Japanese cultural phenomena such as Hara Juku, Kawaii girls have a more doll-like appearance, with big doe-eyes, pastel-coloured make-up and colourful hair.

Kawaii fashion is based on Victorian fashion, with wearers intent on looking cute, innocent and pretty courtesy of lace, ribbons, bows, ruffles and aprons.

The most common form of Kawaii is the Classic Lolita, which has subsets, including the Sweet Lolita, which has even more ribbons, bows, and lace, and Fairy Kei, which often includes giant bow headdresses or bonnets.

Because Kawaii is a lifestyle rather than a purely fashion phenomenon, certain behaviour such as high pitched voices and girly giggles are expected of those who embrace it.

In the UK, the majority of Kawaii girls are teens, although in Japan, many are much older. A study by cosmetic company Kanebo found that women in their 20s and 30s actively attempt to achieve the cute look, which is considered the beauty ideal by both men and women in Japan.
