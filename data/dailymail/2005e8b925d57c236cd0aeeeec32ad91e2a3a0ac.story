A rowdy party hosted by Sir Richard Branson had to be served with a noise abatement notice after complaints from furious neighbours.

The flamboyant tycoon had organised the Club Tropicana-themed party - complete with steel band playing from an open air terrace - for staff at Virgin's headquarters in Paddington, West London, last night.

But the din from the bash provoked anger from a number of residents in nearby Little Venice area of the capital.

Westminster Council said it received eight complaints between 7pm and 10.30pm.

Officers from the council twice asked revellers at the 'Virgin Club Tropicana 
Buccaneering Booze Up' to reduce the volume before finally serving them with a noise abatement notice at the Battleship building in Paddington.

Carole
Ridley, who is retired, told the Evening Standard: 'Other people don’t 
want to hear your choice of music blasting out in the open air. The lady
below me has school age children. How are they going to manage?

Sir Richard attended the fancy dress party, where staff donned pirate 
outfits, flower garlands and Hawaiian shirts, for an hour or so from 8om to 9pm but was not there when the abatement notice was served.

A Virgin spokesman confirmed that the themed office party - on the 4th and 5th floor and the terrace next to the West Way -started around 6pm and had a steel band on the roof until 7.30pm. 

He
said that as soon as the council complained, the steel band were 
brought inside and then turned the music down once the notice had been 
served.

He added: 'We are 
sorry for the inconvenience caused to neighbours by our office party. 
When notified by Westminster Council we moved the party inside to reduce
the noise and then turned the music down.'

A Westminster Council spokesman said: 'Our noise team received eight complaints from neighbours between 7pm and 10.30pm last night and after asking for the music to be turned down several times, officers eventually issued a noise abatement notice requiring it to be turned off completely. 

'No further action will be taken unless there is a recurrence.'
