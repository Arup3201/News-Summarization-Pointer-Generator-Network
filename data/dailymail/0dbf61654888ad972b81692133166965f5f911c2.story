Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is speaking out against partisan politics in Washington - saying that the current  Congress isn't 'equipped really to do anything'.

Ginsburg, who was the second woman ever appointed to the Supreme Court, also talked about how she still experiences sexism in the chamber - and said she has no plans to retire anytime soon.

While discussing Congress, Ginsburg said she was confident the country would one day get the legislature it deserved.

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in a recent interview that the current Republican-controlled Congress wasn't 'equipped really to do anything'

'The current Congress is not equipped really to do anything... Someday, we will go back to having the kind of legislature that we should, where members, whatever party they belong to, want to make the thing work and cooperate with each other to see that that will happen,' she told MSNBC. 

Ginsburg's fighting words should come as no surprise. One of the loudest voices of dissent in conservative Chief Justice John Roberts' court, she has hardly been shy when it comes to expressing her disapproval.

But there was a period of time when she said she couldn't make her point of view heard at all. 

'Once it happened all the time that I would say something and there was no response and then a man would say the same thing and people would say "good idea,"' she said. 

'That happens much less today.' 

And Ginsburg, who has beaten two forms of cancer and said she does 20 push ups a day, also has no problem shooting down calls for her retirement based on concerns for her age and health. 

The eldest sitting justice on the court, Ginsburg described her job as the 'best and hardest' one she's ever had - and she has no intention of letting it go just yet. 

'I will step down when I feel I can no longer do the job full steam,' she said.

Ginsburg also discussed experiencing sexism in the chamber: 'Once it happened all the time that I would say something and there was no response and then a man would say the same thing and people would say "good idea,"'

‘Once I sense that I am slipping, I will step down’  

But Ginsburg said she has only become more vocal about her opinions as she's aged, saying that, when she was younger, she just accepted that there was nothing she could do about discrimination.

But now Ginsburg said she uses her opinions and speeches to try and teach  'how wrong it is to judge people on the basis of what they look like, the color of their skin, whether they're men or women'.

'My aspirations have not changed since the '70s,' she said. 'My hope for our society is that we're going to use the talent of all of the people and not just half of them.'

And when it comes to racism, Ginsburg believes society still has a long way to go. 

'People who think you could wave a magic wand and the legacy of the past will be over are blind,' she told MSNBC.  

More recently, Ginsburg made headlines after writing a scathing dissent against the Burwell vs Hobby Lobby case, which allowed corporations to use religious beliefs as a reason to not provide contraception in their health care plans. 

The justice was especially worried about how the ruling would affect women who now had to pay for their birth control out of pocket.

She wrote: 'It bears note in this regard that the cost of an IUD is nearly equivalent to a month's full-time pay for workers earning the minimum wage.' 

Ginsburg said she has only gotten more confident about voicing her opinions as she's aged, saying that, when she was younger, she just accepted that there was nothing she could do about discrimination

Ginsburg voiced similar concerns when discussing how state-enforced abortion laws were especially hurting low-income women.

Although Ginsburg was confident that 'women of means' will always have access to safe abortions, she said current state restrictions were operating 'against the woman who doesn't have the freedom to move, to go where she is able to get safely what she wants'. 

Even as she was happy to voice her opinions on race and women's rights, Ginsburg was careful to keep silent about same-sex marriage, which the court will rule on this year. 

'I don't want to suggest how the court will decide that case, one way or another,' she told MSNBC. 

Ginsburg, who is the first Supreme Court Justice to officiate a same-sex wedding and recently said nationwide marriage equality would not require 'a large adjustment' from Americans, has already come under fire from groups. 

The National Organization for Marriage demanded that Ginsburg disqualify herself from the upcoming hearings because she had made it 'crystal clear that she is going to rule in favor of redefining marriage when these cases come before her,' a spokesman said.  

Despite calls to retire so Obama can select her successor, Ginsburg said she has no plans to quit and that she will step down when 'I feel I can no longer do the job full steam'
