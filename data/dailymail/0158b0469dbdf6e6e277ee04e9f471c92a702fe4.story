John Bilardi is a shattered man. He has poured his heart out in an interview about his late son, the troubled youth dubbed "Jihad Jake", who died in a suicide mission in central Iraq last week.

Mr Bilardi tells 60 Minutes that he cannot come to grips with his son's decisions, to run away from their Melbourne home and join Islamic State, a move which ultimately cost him his life, at age 18. 

'He was just a shy, lonely young man,' he tells reporter Michael Usher.

The teenager is believed to have converted to Islam in 2012 when he was in Year 10, shortly after his mother died of cancer. 

'Just out of the blue he said, "I've gone Muslim",' his father said.

'I can't imagine how he was feeling.' 

He recounts his son's final message, sent from the ISIS bunker to his father, as he was convinced to take his own life. It was: 'Hi Dad, I am very happy to be here'.

'He was just a shy, lonely young man,' John Bilardi says of his son Jake who joined Islamic State

And Mr Bilardi issued a chilling warning to other parents about the lure of terrorists to defenceless young Australians.

'It's going on, it's real.' 

His revelations coming, as an Islamic State propaganda website, geared towards celebrating the sacrifice made by the Melbourne teenage jihadi, did anything but glorify the actions of the 18-year-old suicide bomber.

The post, titled as the story of Abu Abdullah Al-Austrālī – the name Bilardi adopted after he travelled to Iraq to join IS – gives the teenager some praise as a devout Muslims who prays and fasts often.

But the rant describes Bilardi as having ‘a weak body’ and having 'sold his soul for a cheap price', revealing how misguided his decisions were.

Bilardi, who fled to the Middle East last year from his Melbourne home, reportedly died after he blew himself up in a suicide mission targeting the Iraqi armed forces at Ramadi in central Iraq last week.

The attack was a failure. Iraqi military official, General Tahssin Ibrahim, said no one was killed and just a few vehicles were damaged in Bilardi's suicide mission.

The extremist site sought to praise Bilardi but delivers backhanded comments describing his weakness and ultimately the futility of his sacrifice.

‘He started fighting in Baijī against the ISF Rāfidha and was a lion on the battlefield although he was at a young age and with a weak body, he was like a mountain,’ the post, on a tumblr blog site associated with the Islamic extremist group, said.

It goes on to say that Bilardi volunteered for a 'martyrdom operation' - code words for a suicide bombing - and that he was eager to carry out the mission. 

Earlier social media posts suggested Bilardi had wanted to take part in a suicide bombing in Baiji in Iraq, but that he pulled out of this mission because he got cold feet.

Instead he fought in the city before again signing up for martrydom and being sent to Ramadi in Iraq.

The post said Bilardi was 'full of happiness as he was finally going to meet his Lord and receive the great rewards promised by Him.'

But it goes on to mock his sacrifice. 

'This brother originated from an atheist family & ended up selling his soul to Allah for a cheap price,' the post says.

An image of Bilardi sitting in front of an Islamic State flag was posted to Twitter, ahead of his suicide mission in Iraq, which authorities labelled 'a failure'

The post said that during his time in Ramadi, Bilardi was very devout 'known for his worship of Allah' and would fast every other day.

It said Bilardi accepted Islam three years ago ‘even though his parents basically went to war with him at home tried to stop him from reverting’. 

'Happy-slapped': Jake Bilardi was bullied while at high school in Craigieburn Secondary College in Melbourne's north, and video emerged of the incident ahead of his suicide mission for Islamic State

A video later surfaced from his school days which shows Bilardi being 'happy slapped' - a bullying tactic which sees a group of people slap their victim, film it and upload it on-line to humiliate them.

In December, Bilardi reached Ramadi, a city located in central Iraq, and said he 'made hijra (or departed)’ in August. 

He was considered a well-educated maths genius, who dreamed of one day becoming a political journalist and even founded a children’s soccer charity but by the time he’d reached his 18th birthday Jake Bilardi’s mind had been warped.

If you believe his tale of events - detailed in an articulate blog called From Melbourne to Ramadi: My Journey - Bilardi joined Islamic State fighters in Iraq after years of historical research and a final realisation that 'I was growing tired of the corruption and filthiness of Australian society and yearned to live under the Islamic State with the Muslims'.

However, the picture Bilardi paints of himself – a scholar and a rational thinker – is very different to the lonely outcast that his former classmates at Craigieburn Secondary College have described.

‘At school he was a "loner". He only really had two or three friends from memory but they weren't the type of friends that if he was in need of some help were good at helping,’ a former classmate told Daily Mail Australia.

‘He was obviously a kid that needed some help or guidance and he thought converting to Muslim was right for him,’ they opined.

Another classmate, after hearing that Bilardi may be dead, described him as not 'capable of punching his way out of a wet paper bag. He was fragile'.

'The kid (was) angry at the world and wants to take it out on innocent people.'
