The Duke of Cambridge loves The Hobbit movies and knows all about the fantasy world they're set in, actor Martin Freeman has revealed.

Freeman, who plays Bilbo Baggins in the trilogy, said the royal told him he was a fan at the London premiere of the first film,  An Unexpected Journey.

Since then he has starred in the second The Hobbit film called The Desolation Of Smaug, and the third, There and Back Again, is due to be released in December.

The 42-year-old said: 'He was a nice guy. He is the biggest royal fan. He knew all the facts about Middle Earth and obviously wanted to be there. Kate was in hospital at the time.'

Freeman was speaking at the Olivier Awards for stage plays, The Sunday People reported.

The Duchess of Cambridge had been admitted suffering from acute morning sickness seven months before the birth of Prince George last year.

The second film in The Hobbit trilogy saw Bilbo
 continue his adventure across Middle Earth with Gandalf, Thorin and 
the Dwarves, as Azog the Defiler and his Orc warriors pursue them.

The 
film climaxed when he encounters Smaug the dragon, voiced by 
Freeman's Sherlock co-star Benedict Cumberbatch.

The Hobbit: The Desolation Of Smaug picked up where An Unexpected Journey left off, and was released 
internationally on December 13.
