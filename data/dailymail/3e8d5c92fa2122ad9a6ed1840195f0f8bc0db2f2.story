The British banker accused of murdering two women in Hong Kong was reportedly left 'devastated' when his fiancee cheated on him after she moved to New York for her job.

Cambridge graduate Rurik Jutting has been charged with two counts of murder after one woman's decapitated body was found in a suitcase on the balcony of his luxury flat, and another with her throat slashed.

The former public schoolboy and Cambridge graduate dated a string of beautiful girls from Asia and last year had a relationship with a stunning British fashion student.

Last night fresh claims emerged that he was obsessed with having sex with 'two or three women' and held drug-fuelled sex parties lasting for days at his flat.

But it was also suggested that he had been left 'devastated' when a fellow City trader cheated on him two years ago after the pair had been engaged to be married.

And it was claimed he had vowed to kill himself because of his ongoing depression. Channel 4 News said it had spoken to a former girlfriend who claimed Jutting was deeply unhappy because of his job.

The woman, who did not want to be named, dated Jutting for about two months after meeting him in July 2013 – the month he moved to Hong Kong – in a bar where she worked.

'He's a perfectionist,' she told the programme. 'He was a very nice person with me because I was his girlfriend. He was always strict with other people.

'He told me that he had financial problems and some issues with stuff. Last October he told me that he tried to kill himself. I think he tried to kill himself because he's under pressure with his job. He was depressed.' She added: 'He liked a variety of sex, two or three girls. He was never violent towards me.'

An acquaintance in the banking world recalled Jutting being distraught two years ago after his then-fiancée – a fellow British trader – cheated on him with another man.

The woman, named by The Telegraph as Sarah Butt, 28, had met Jutting in 2010 when they were both working for Barclays in London.

However, she reportedly had kissed another man after moving to New York from London to work for Goldman Sachs last year.

Although the couple attempted to rekindle their romance - even getting engaged for a short time - Jutting struggled to get over the 'affair' and ended the relationship a short time later.

The source said: 'She wanted to marry him pretty fervently and he proposed, but she ended up cheating on him. It was him ultimately him who broke it off. I think he took her infidelity quite badly.' 

Miss Butt, originally from Bury, Lancashire reportedly joined Barclays Capital from Pricewaterhouse Coopers after studying at Imperial College London. 

After a year in the U.S. she is now said to be back in the UK. It is understood Miss Butt has had no contact with Jutting since the break-up.

'She's very upset, it's a lot to take in,' a source told the newspaper. 

Her mother, Tasheen Butt, who lives in Bury having come to the UK from India as a teenager said she did not know about her daughter's relationship with Jutting.

Jutting is also believed to have dated glamorous British fashion student Sonya Dyer, 29, once said to have described him as her 'hubby'. Asked about him at her flat in West London last night, she tearfully declined to comment.

After leaving £34,000-a-year Winchester College, he graduated in 2008 from Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he studied law and history and was secretary of the university's history society. Jutting then worked as a trader at Barclays Bank in London for two years before joining Merrill Lynch. In 2013, he moved to Merrill's Hong Kong office.

He surrounded himself with beautiful Asian women and showed off his new life to friends back home in a series of online updates. Many of the pictures he posted featured young mother Ariane Guarin from the Philippines – known to friends as Yanie.

The couple uploaded photographs of themselves to their respective Facebook pages in July and August but appear to have broken up by early September. On September 20, a friend took to Jutting's Facebook page to say she missed the couple and wished they were still together.

Miss Guarin had divided her time between looking after her children in a small town in the Philippines and partying with overweight Jutting, who called her his 'beautiful honey'. Miss Guarin, whose family live in Angono, a tiny town ten miles east of Philippine capital Manila, is seen wearing necklaces and rings in shots with Jutting and appeared to come into money, with friends asking her for loans on Facebook, where she boasted of building a new home in the Philippines.

Such was their lavish lifestyle together, her friends compared the couple to Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie – known by the combined name 'Brangelina' – by calling Rurik and Yanie 'Ruyanie'.

But Jutting's complex love life took another twist when a friend of Miss Guarin's told MailOnline she was his current girlfriend.

Speaking to MailOnline from Quezon City in the Philippines, the woman said she had been in a relationship with him for two months, and last spoke to him on October 20 – 11 days before he was arrested.

She said Jutting was a 'good and intelligent' person who had never displayed any signs of violence, although he was 'very strict' with other women – a symptom of his perfectionism and his desire to 'do the right thing'. She added: 'I can say that he is a good man. A good boyfriend, sweet lover.'

Jutting posted on Facebook on Monday last week that he was embarking on a 'new journey', writing: 'Stepping down from the ledge. Burden lifted; new journey begins. Scared and anxious but also excited. The first step is always the hardest.'

In Britain, Jutting's stunned family are still coming to terms with his arrest. His mother Helen, 52, who was born in Hong Kong and whose father was a policeman, was not available for comment at the milkshake bar she runs in Woking, Surrey, while his father Graham, 53, a millwright engineer, has declined to comment. The couple have another son who lives in Brighton.

Meanwhile the parents of murder victim Sumarti Ningshi have demanded that Hong Kong executes whoever is eventually found guilty of killing her.

Ahmad Kaliman, 58, was also quoted by the BBC's Indonesian language service as saying he desperately wants Hong Kong to send his daughter's body home once the investigation into her death is completed, rather than bury her in the territory.

'I appeal to the government to help repatriate my daughter,' he said. 

Hong Kong formally abolished the death penalty in 1993 while still a British colony and continues to operate an entirely different legal system from the rest of China, where executions are commonplace.
