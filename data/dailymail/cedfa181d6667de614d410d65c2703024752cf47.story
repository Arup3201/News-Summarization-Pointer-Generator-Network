Suicide: Martial arts expert Steven LaVallee, 55, hanged himself at his Florida home after molestation charges

A martial arts expert who ran several training schools hanged himself as police were on the verge of bringing sexual molestation charges against him. 

Steven LaVallee, 55, killed himself at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida on Monday.

Police had been about to charge LaVallee with simple battery after he allegedly improperly touched a man during a massage in May last year.

The trainer was being investigated by Florida police after they had received reports from upstate New York, where LaVallee had eight sports centers, which accused him of molesting two teenage boys.

The statute of limitations had 
expired on the allegations in the Syracuse area but authorities in 
Florida said LaVallee was aware that fresh charges were pending.

LaVallee owned five USA Black Belt Champions schools across Florida in Fort Lauderdale, North Palm Beach, Boca Raton, Coconut Creek and Lighthouse Point.

He had studied martial arts for 35 years and earned a 7th degree black belt.

According to the Orlando Sentinel, a man who attended LaVallee's school said he had been inappropriately touched by the trainer after he offered to show off new massage techniques.

According the cases filed in New York state, a man accused LaVallee of molesting him when he was 13 or 14 years old.

The allegations stem from 1993 but 
were not reported until this January meaning no charges could be brought
after the ten-year statute of limitations had ran out.

All investigations have been closed following LaVallee's suicide. His attorney made no comment. 

Another
owner of a martial arts school, Kim Ling, told the Sentinel that 
LaVallee was 'one of the top guys business wise' but many in the sports 
community had been aware of the allegations levied against him.

LaVallee, who had been named man of 
the year five times by the International Martial Arts Association, 
leaves a wife and young son.

He ran a string of successful businesses and led seminars and acted as a consultant on how to make money from martial arts.

According to 
worldwidedojo.com, he based his training philosophy on Bruce Lee 
blending different styles of martial arts together.
