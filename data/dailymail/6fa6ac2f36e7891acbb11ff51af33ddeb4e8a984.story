A heroic fisherman's lightning reactions saved a toddler from certain death as the child's pram hurtled towards the edge of a cliff.

Mehmet Soysal was on the phone in a hill in Bodrum, in the southwest of Turkey, when he spotted the pram flying towards the 50ft drop.

Captured on CCTV footage, he is seen dropping his phone and rushing to grab hold of the pram.

The two-year-old boy, called Ali Ceyhan, is propelled out of the chair and onto the tarmac just metres from the cliff's edge.

Mr Soysal then runs over to pick up the toddler as stunned passers-by watch. 

Ali's mother Cansu Sahin, 29, said: 'I had turned round to show my husband something and had taken my hands off the pram for just a second.

'I can't begin to thank enough the man who saved my little boy.

'He is an absolute hero.'

Shop owner Mumtaz Nas, 30, said: 'It all happened so fast. I was chatting with my friend as the man walked towards us.

'Suddenly he turned round and the next thing I knew a pram appeared out of nowhere.

'We ran over and luckily the boy was OK, but we called an ambulance anyway.'

A hospital spokesman said: 'He is a very lucky boy.

'He didn't sustain any real injuries and thanks to the fisherman he is still alive.

'If he hadn't caught the pram then without doubt the boy would have gone over the edge.'
