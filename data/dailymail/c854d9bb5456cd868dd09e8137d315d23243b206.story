Tens of thousands of people a year are dying unnecessarily of cancer simply because they are elderly or poor, a report has revealed.

The National Audit Office, which analysed the latest NHS figures, accused the health service of age discrimination when it came to cancer patients’ care.

It said if the cancer mortality rates of the poorest people were brought up to the level of the most well-off, there would be almost 20,000 fewer deaths every single year.

‘Significant variations and inequalities in outcomes and access to services persist,’ the report stated. ‘Outcomes and access to services are generally poorer for older patients. 

And those from more deprived socio-economic groups are more likely to experience worse outcomes compared with those from less deprived groups.’ 

For all cancer patients, five-year survival rates are still 10 per cent behind the average for the six most wealthy European nations.

In Sweden, 64 per cent of cancer patients are still alive after five years but in England it is just 49 per cent. For patients aged 75 and above, the gap is even worse.

Pressure on NHS resources could mean that progress on survival rates ‘stalls’ in the coming years.

‘Poorer access to treatment or poorer quality of care’ is mostly to blame for the gaps, according to the report.

It continues: ‘People in England are less likely to develop cancer than in other high-income countries in Europe but, according to the most recent data, cancer outcomes in England have generally been worse.

‘Outcomes are particularly poor in relative terms for older patients.’

Those aged 55 to 64 are about 20 per cent more likely to survive a year after being diagnosed with cancer than those aged 75 or more. 

This is much too large a gap to be explained by frailty alone, according to the NAO, indicating that age discrimination may be at least partly to blame.

Meanwhile, waiting times for urgent cancer treatment are increasing, with the number of NHS trusts failing to meet targets doubling in a year to 64. 

From last July to September alone, some 5,500 patients waited more than 62 days for treatment.

The damning report comes at a difficult time for the Coalition, which is already having to explain why there is an A&E crisis, with waiting times at record levels.

Last night Labour MP Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said she was ‘deeply disappointed’ by the ‘shocking disparity’ in cancer survival rates compared with Europe. 

‘There are also unacceptable inequalities within England that must be tackled,’ she added.

Sean Duffy, national clinical director for cancer at NHS England, said he accepted that survival rates needed to improve.

‘Cancer survival rates in England are at an all-time high ... it’s time for a fresh look at how we can do even better – with more focus on prevention, earlier diagnosis and modern radiotherapy and other services so that over the next five years we can save at least 8,000 more lives a year.’

He added: ‘We have established an independent cancer taskforce to produce a new five-year cancer strategy by the summer, which will set out what needs to be done to achieve this ambition.’
