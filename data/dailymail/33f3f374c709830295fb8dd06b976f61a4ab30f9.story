Eoin Morgan went range hitting  before displaying plenty of attacking intent off the field in backing his coach and under-performing No 3 and then defending his decision not to sing the national anthem at this World Cup.

Plenty of sixes were hit in practice at the Basin Reserve before Morgan, who showed glimpses of a return to form in England’s win over Scotland, aimed a couple of big verbal blows in standing up for Peter Moores and Gary Ballance.

Then the Irish captain of England addressed his reluctance to join in with God Save the Queen ahead of each game, in contrast to the bulk of his side who have been belting it out with gusto.

England face Sri Lanka on Saturday and the captain was robust in his defence of Ballance even though he has looked rusty in scoring 10 in each of his three World Cup games since being brought in at the last minute.

Alex Hales has been ‘knocking hard on the door’ according to batting coach Mark Ramprakash and England, it seems, will wait until the last minute before they decide whether to stick or twist again, after ripping up their World Cup plans on the eve of their first game.

‘We’re three games into a World Cup,’ said Morgan, who has been given the team he wants in this tournament. ‘Gary came into the side four games ago and scored 70 (it was actually 57 in the final warm-up match against Pakistan).

‘He has played against two of the toughest teams in the World Cup and then dragged one on against Scotland. In my eyes he has been a bit unlucky. He hasn’t played a lot of cricket over the last month and I think any criticism of him at the moment is unfair. He’s a fantastic cricketer and has a huge amount of potential.’

Gary Ballance has looked out of form

Ballance was left out of the one-day tour of Sri Lanka before Christmas and then broke his finger in practice when England first arrived in Australia, so he has been playing catch-up in this tournament.

He showed last summer that he is on his way to becoming a special Test player and England believe that, in time, a batsman who averages more than 50 in domestic one-day cricket can be similarly effective at international level.

The question is whether this World Cup is the right time to bed Ballance in to the one-day side or whether should England add more dynamism into the top order in the form of Hales, who is deserving of his chance now more than ever. Ravi Bopara, dumped on the eve of the first game but impressive in practice here, will also return to England’s thoughts.

England, with one victory in their first three Group A games, are pretty much where everyone expected them to be at this stage but the scale of their defeats by Australia and New Zealand raised more questions over Moores.

Moores was always likely to find himself under the spotlight in his second coming as coach but privately it is said that the players like and respect him and that he gets his message across to them, however unconvincing he is in public. His new one-day captain offered his support. 

‘Mooresey has been completely different to Andy Flower, Ashley Giles or anyone else I have worked with before,’ said Morgan. ‘He brings a lot of energy to the side and a lot of ideas.

‘The basis of international cricket is trying to be one step ahead of the game, particularly as a coach, and he has been good in trying to find those little edges without taking away the basics since he’s been involved.’

The anthem issue is a contentious one because it throws up the whole dynamic of national identity, which is more complicated in cricket than most sports. Morgan is not the first nor the last international sportsman who has chosen not to sing (Darren Sammy was the only player to sing Rally Round the West Indies before the match against South Africa) but it has been noted in Morgan’s case because is a Dubliner now at the helm of the England side.

‘It’s pretty simple,’ said Morgan. ‘I have never sung the National Anthem whether I’ve been playing for Ireland or England. It doesn’t make me any less proud to be an English cricketer.

‘I am extremely proud to be in the position I’m in and privileged to be captain of a World Cup side. It’s a long story but it’s a personal thing.’

Morgan chose not to tell that long story which is a shame because it leaves him open to conjecture as to why he will not exercise his vocal cords. But the bottom line is that it is his choice and it is better surely to be true to yourself rather than, as some dual nationals in England’s recent history have, belted out the anthem for effect.

There are plenty who would not care if Morgan hummed the Irish Rover under his breath while the anthem was being played as long as he scores runs and leads England to a victory over Sri Lanka that would all but guarantee their quarter-final place. It will not be easy.

Sri Lanka defeated England in all forms last summer and then comfortably overcame them again in that one-day series before Christmas. And only on Thursday they demolished Bangladesh with Tillekeratne Dilshan smashing 161 and Kumar Sangakkara scoring a century in his 400th one-day international.

England hope the swing here at the Westpac Stadium with which Tim Southee destroyed them against New Zealand can now work to their advantage.

‘Sri Lanka are in a good place at the moment,’ added Morgan. ‘It’s a test for us coming up again against their best cricketers, guys who have played 300, 400 games. We have done a lot of work on the possibility of the ball swinging throughout the first innings, as it did last time. We’ll be more than happy for the ball to swing around again now.
