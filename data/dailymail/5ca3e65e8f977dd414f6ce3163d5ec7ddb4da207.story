On the pitch, Arsene Wenger watches Alexis Sanchez take his Arsenal tally to eight with a clinical double to sink sorry Sunderland.

Behind him sits Theo Walcott, the fit-again England star who he cannot wait to unleash alongside Sanchez — possibly as soon as Saturday when Burnley visit the Emirates.

‘My imagination works like yours,’ said Wenger when pressed on the prospect of Walcott joining forces with the Chilean forward.

Arsene Wenger was not impressed with the decision to show a yellow card to Danny Welbeck for diving.

The Arsenal and England forward was cautioned when Kevin Friend ruled that he toppled too easily under a challenge from John O’Shea.

Replays, however, support Wenger’s claim that the booking was unjust.

Earlier, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was also judged to have dived – although he wasn’t booked – when Wes Brown’s clumsy tackle sent him crashing to the ground.

And, when asked if his players had been the victim of the recent debate on diving, Wenger said ‘You should ask the referee (that), but I didn’t see a dive (with Welbeck), it was very harsh. And I think in the first half when Chamberlain went through there was a foul as well.’

‘Theo’s runs off the ball are fantastic and he gives you hope that we will score.’

In the meantime, Sanchez has kept Arsenal, in fifth, clinging to the early-season pace-setters.

The £30million signing from Barcelona punished a calamitous Sunderland. First he seized upon Wes Brown’s horribly undercooked back-pass before drawing goalkeeper Vito Mannone to him with the ease of a snake charmer and dinking delightfully beyond him.

Then, when Mannone panicked under pressure from Sanchez late on, the Arsenal man stole in to win the ball and prod it home.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has certainly been impressed by his new comrade, likening him to Luis Suarez, the player who, ironically, replaced Sanchez at the Nou Camp.

‘He’s a world-class player — everyone saw that at the World Cup,’ said the 21-year-old. ‘He reminds me of Luis Suarez when he chases everything down and he makes nothing into something. He’s done that for us twice and he’s scored goals at important times for us.’

Sunderland have only won one of their last 22 league games against Arsenal. 

Arsenal’s victory was just their third in the league this season but arrived on the back of their come-from-behind triumph at Anderlecht. Injuries have blighted their progress — Mesut Ozil, Mathieu Debuchy and Olivier Giroud are long-term absentees — but Mathieu Flamini insists their season remains very much intact.

‘It has been tough for us,’ he said. ‘But if you look where we are, in the top six and hopefully on course for the next stage of the Champions League, then it has not been a bad start this season.

‘The spirit in the team this year is great.’

Sanchez, it seems, has made all the difference.

Gus Poyet says it is ‘impossible’ for Sunderland to win matches if they continue to gift goals to the opposition.

The Black Cats were guilty of a string of defensive howlers as they were beaten 8-0 at Southampton last weekend.

But mistakes from Wes Brown and goalkeeper Vito Mannone allowed Alexis Sanchez to score twice on Saturday, and Poyet warned: ‘We cannot make any more. No more mistakes. Individual like that, no more, otherwise it is impossible to win games.’
