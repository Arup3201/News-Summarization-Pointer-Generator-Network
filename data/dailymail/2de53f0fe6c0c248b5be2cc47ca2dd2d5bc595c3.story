Scottish nationalists were last night dealt a blow after a little-seen video emerged of the European Council president saying separatism is a ‘word of the past’ and ‘nobody has anything to gain’ from it.

Herman Van Rompuy, 65, who would chair discussions over whether an independent Scotland could join the European Union, was asked about his views on separatism in a video discussion last year.

He told a man from Edinburgh called 'Keith' on YouTube that the world must join together to combat the global financial crisis and climate change - and that ‘we will only succeed if we can pool forces’.

Mr Van Rompuy was asked in the June 2011 video: ‘What is your view on separatism in Europe? Do you agree with Scottish nationalism and the evil work it portrays to end the United Kingdom?’

He replied: ‘Separatism is a word of the past. Nobody has anything to gain from separatism in the world of today which, whether one likes it or not, is globalised.

‘We have so many important challenges to take and we will only succeed if we can pool forces, join action, take common directions. The global financial crisis is hitting us hard.

‘Climate change is threatening the planet. How can separatism help? The word of the future is "union".’

Discussions: The comments are a blow to Scottish first minister Alex Salmond (left), whose claim that an independent Scotland would get automatic EU membership was slammed by deputy PM Nick Clegg (right)

Mr Van Rompuy - whose video had less than 1,500 views by this morning - will still be the council’s president in 2014 when the independence referendum is scheduled, reported the Observer.

A source close to Mr Van Rompuy, whose term ends at the end of 2014, said he will not protest against Scottish independence because he would ‘never involve himself in a national dispute’.

But the source told the Observer that Scotland could find itself in the position of its reapplication for EU membership being discussed at meetings chaired by Mr Van Rompuy.

The comments are a blow to Scottish first minister Alex Salmond, whose claim that Scotland would get automatic EU membership has been slammed by deputy prime minister Nick Clegg.

Mr Clegg said Scottish nationalists are in ‘denial, preferring political assertion to legal advice’. Former foreign secretary David Miliband added that Mr Salmond's claim was nonsense.
