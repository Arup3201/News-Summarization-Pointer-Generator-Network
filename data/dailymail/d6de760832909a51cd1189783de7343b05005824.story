A bear terrified a Utah family inside their RV on Saturday as the animal scratched and pawed at their mobile home in an attempt to gain entry.

KSL reported that Sami Graham was inside with her two young children when the bear approached the RV, which was parked in Book Cliffs.

'This bear is standing straight up on his hind legs looking at me straight in the eye [through a window],' she told the affiliate station. 'I wasn't expecting to be nose-to-nose with this bear. I just hurried and closed my blinds.'

Family: Sami Graham was camping with her family on Saturday when the bear approached the trailer and tried to get in 

Damage: Scratch marks caused by the eager bear can be seen on the outside of the RV 

Graham did not immediately respond to a request for comment from MailOnline. 

The family tried to shoo the bear away 'by slamming cupboards, jumping up and down and increasing the volume on the TV,' the station reported. 

The bear continued trying to get inside, KSL reported, and left heavy scratch marks in its wake on the trailer's side and front door that were visible in photographs. 

Graham told the affiliate station 'It sounded like you were running your fingers down a chalkboard.'

The bear finally left after her husband arrived and shot warning shots overhead, KSL reported.

'I always wanted to see a bear in the wild,' Graham said. 'And it was on my bucket list, but I didn't want to kick the bucket to have it off my bucket list.'

The Division of Wildlife Resources' Dax Mangus told KSL the area is in the middle of a bear hunt.

'[Bears] like the same kind of food we like if they can get it,' he told the station.

'They usually don't just go around knocking on campsites to say, "hello,"' Wild Aware Utah's Stephanie Natt told AOL. "There could have been something attracting him there, something in the fire, pit, something still on the picnic table, maybe cooking and the smell carried-something brought that bear there.'
