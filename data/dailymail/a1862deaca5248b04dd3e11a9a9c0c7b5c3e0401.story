One of the most captivating sights on Earth is the night sky, with its dazzling stars, meteor showers and glowing galaxies.

Or, at least, it should be. If you look up at the sky tonight, chances are you won’t see much.

The reality is the stars are disappearing. Around 90 per cent of the country resembles a blank orange canvas dotted with a few hazy stars and planets.

These detailed night time aerial photographs show how much light is wasted in a British city. The incredible snaps were taken by Bluesky International over Leicester during the last two weeks

The culprit is bad lighting, dumped upwards into the sky by our cities’ shops, gardens, homes and streets.

These incredible images reveal, in unprecedented detail, exactly how much light is being wasting in a British city.

The snaps were taken over two weeks in Leicester, which is home to National Space Centre.

Captured by Bluesky International using a camera with thermal imaging sensors, the pictures show how bright the city looks from the night sky.

Inefficient lighting wastes over £1 
billion a year in the UK alone, according to the Astronomical 
Association's Campaign for Dark Skies.

Today light pollutions means that around 90 per cent of the country resembles a blank orange canvas dotted with a few hazy stars and planets.

As well as masking the view of the night sky, light pollution has also been blamed for disrupting the migration of birds, the breeding patterns of nocturnal animals and insect populations.

One picture shows the whole of the city centre surrounded by the ring-road which appears as a glowing yellow circle.

Other images show the lit-up Highcross shopping centre as well as the railway station and a giant oval car park near to where the remains of King Richard III were discovered.

The photos illustrate the difference between modern and old-fashioned lighting - with the new LED lamps showing up as a brighter white light whereas the older gas-based ones are visible as an orange glow.

Research has shown it disrupts people's sleep patterns, while one study light at night can disrupt the body's production of the brain hormone melatonin, which in turn increases the risk of developing breast cancer.

Bluesky International, who captured the images, have digitally matched them to street maps and branded their project ‘the world's first integrated night mapping system’.

The company, which provides Google Maps with their aerial images, now plan to role the night-time images out to other British cities.

They also hope to work with Leicester University and use the pictures to produce data to help combat light pollution, energy wastage and managed urban habitats.

Bluesky have digitally matched the images to street maps, such as this one showing John Lewis car park. The department store, which shines brightly at night, opened in September 2008 as part of the Highcross redevelopment

With a population of 280000, Leicester is the largest city in the East Midlands and the tenth largest in the country

‘Light pollution impacts all of us in many ways from a loss of view of the night sky to health problems caused by lack of sleep,’ said James Eddy, Technical Director at Bluesky.

‘Intrusion of light into a bird or animals habitat can affect breeding or feeding patterns causing a threat to our urban wildlife, while inefficient or ineffective street lighting can impact crime patterns and costs money through wasted electricity.

‘By integrating a camera, specially adapted to cope with the challenges of night time surveying, within our state of the art aerial mapping system we can ensure high levels of positional accuracy for the night time images.

‘We are looking at how much light has been wasted.

‘If the street lights can be seen from as high up as the plan then they are obviously too bright and wasting energy.

‘The plan is to do more cities; we've had a lot of interest from other local authorities already.’
