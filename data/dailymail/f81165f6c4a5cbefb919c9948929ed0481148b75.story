Winston Reid is ready to sign a new contract with West Ham after all, following his latest round of talks.

The New Zealand central defender is out of contract in the summer and had looked set for a move to Tottenham  while Arsenal also showed an interest.

However, West Ham’s owners have proposed a healthy contract and, combined with the club’s resurgence, Reid is close to agreeing to stay.

Winston Reid looks set to sign a new deal at West Ham after being linked with a move away in the summer

Reid was linked with a move at the end of the season to either Tottenham or Arsenal 

Reid has been at West Ham since 2010 after joining from Danish club FC Midtjylland

The news would reflect another step forward for West Ham as they continue to harbour hopes of qualifying for Europe this season despite the setback of Saturday’s defeat by Crystal Palace. 

The 26-year-old Reid joined West Ham from Danish club FC Midtjylland in 2010 and has been an impressive performer at the heart of their defence since his arrival, playing a key role this season.
