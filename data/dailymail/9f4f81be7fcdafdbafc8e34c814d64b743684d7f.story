My daughter Imogen can’t be more than six months old in the photo. Propped up with cushions on the sofa, her chubby little fingers grasp not a favourite cuddly toy, but a cup of tea.

Moments earlier she’d carefully, slowly, brought it to her lips for a sip. Judging by the delighted look on her face, she clearly relished the brew.

Now seven, Imogen still loves her cup of tea in the morning, and it’s the same story for both her little brothers.

Hugo, six, won’t go to school unless he has polished off at least two cups — and it had better be ‘builder’s’, made from tea bags. He can’t stand the posh stuff, and woe betide if there are any tea leaves floating at the top. Oscar, who has just turned four, likes his milky and sweet.

I’m mortified by their tea-drinking. My own mother wouldn’t have dreamed of letting me drink tea as a child growing up in London; she considered it a social drink for adults, almost as taboo as alcohol.

The reason my own children developed the habit is that we lived for the first few years of their lives on the North Yorkshire/Lancashire border with my mother-in-law — a granny who loved to have a natter with her grandchildren over a cuppa.

From around the age of two, she’d give them tea in the afternoon, which they’d enjoy with a ginger biscuit or two. The tea was milky, tepid and laced with sugar. I didn’t like it, but it seemed rude to tell her she couldn’t carry on a family tradition; her own children had always enjoyed a ‘hot drink’ when they were young.

Also, as a ‘soft Southerner’, I felt I was being disrespectful to her culture. According to her, it’s still common for young children to drink tea in the north of England.

Even after moving hundreds of miles south to Hampshire in 2012, my repeated attempts to wean my trio off tea have all ended in failure — partly because I am sabotaged when Granny comes to stay, and partly because the school run is hard enough without wailing children refusing to get in the car until they’ve had their morning brew.  

But the subject of whether young children should have a cup is a hotly debated on many a parenting forum. ‘I really, really don’t like seeing babies and toddlers drinking tea, and seeing it in a bottle is just awful!’ writes one mum.

‘I certainly won’t be encouraging my son to drink anything like that at home where he’s happy with fruit juice, water or milk,’ adds another.

Certainly at my local toddler group in rural Hampshire, I find myself in a minority of one when I queue for a beaker of tea for Oscar at break-time. I’ve noticed a few pointed looks as I hold out his sippy cup.

At first glance, the case against giving toddlers tea does look pretty powerful. Dietitian Chris Cashin, a spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association, warns young children shouldn’t drink tea because it can interfere with the absorption of iron.

‘Tea contains compounds, called polyphenols, which bind with iron, making it harder for our bodies to absorb it,’ she explains.

‘Iron deficiency causes symptoms such as tiredness and lethargy, and can make it harder to concentrate.’

For small children, this may also mean they reach developmental milestones late. Iron is vital for brain development, and children who lack iron may also fail to grow at the expected rate.

But it’s the caffeine in tea that is the biggest cause for concern. As well as being a stimulant, it can lead to calcium deficiency.

Studies suggest that drinking as little as two cups of tea a day can decrease your ability to absorb calcium — not a problem if you are an adult eating a healthy, balanced diet, but potentially an issue if you are a fast-growing child.

Tannin, the compound that gives tea its colour, also stains teeth. I have to admit that little Imogen did have a bit of tea staining on her teeth, but it was simply polished off at the dentist’s.

But according to other experts, tea actually is a good drink for toddlers.

For a start, it may be beneficial to enamel because it contains fluoride that remineralises and hardens the tough outer coating of baby and adult teeth, according to Karen Coates, dental adviser at the British Dental Health Foundation.

‘You couldn’t use tea instead of toothpaste, but it has a reasonable amount of fluoride and could have a positive impact on teeth,’ she says.

Of course, any benefit would be cancelled out if a child drank tea with sugar, which I have to admit is the case with Oscar and Hugo, who insist on at least one spoonful. But at least none of my children has ever had tea from a bottle, which is particularly damaging because it keeps the sugary liquid close to the teeth for longer, increasing the risk of decay.

‘Only water and milk should be drunk from bottles, but tea from a cup would be fine, as long as it is sugar-free,’ says Karen Coates. ‘Make it milky to get the added benefit of calcium.’

A recent study in the Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics found that children who drank moderate amounts of tea (up to two cups a day) suffered no harmful effects.

The small amounts of caffeine in two cups could even be beneficial, by increasing concentration in school or in sports performance.

Studies showing negative effects of caffeine on children, including anxiety and sleep problems, relate to high doses. A ten-year-old would have to drink 160mg per day of caffeine (four to six cups).

Tea is also a recognised source of flavonoids, plant compounds with proven health effects including boosting heart health. To my amazement Dr Carrie Ruxton, the author of the study, says she is happy to recommend tea for pre-schoolers.

Dr Ruxton is also a member of the Tea Advisory Panel, a body funded by the British tea industry to provide information on the health benefits of a cuppa. ‘Up to a certain point, tea is an excellent drink for children,’ she says. ‘But, like other caffeine-containing drinks, it should be consumed in moderation, with no more than two cups a day for a toddler.’

According to Dr Ruxton, tea — which is 99 per cent water — is an excellent way to hydrate children, and unlike bottled water contains many antioxidants, minerals and nutrients. ‘Children who drink milky tea, as opposed to fizzy drinks and fruit juices, are getting a sugar-free source of fluids,’ she says.  For a caffeine-free alternative, try Rooibos tea.

Finally, there’s the social aspect. Debra Scriven, 42, an office administrator from Liphook in Hampshire, says that daughters Isabella, two, and seven-year-old Emma love to copy their mum and dad Robert, 38, in a ‘family ritual’ of drinking tea.

The girls started when they were still in nappies with very milky tea. Debra says: ‘Just think of truly harmful things, like junk food.’

As for me, now that I know a cup or two a day is unlikely to cause my three children long-term harm, I’m certainly more relaxed. If only Hugo and Oscar would stop slipping in all that sugar.
