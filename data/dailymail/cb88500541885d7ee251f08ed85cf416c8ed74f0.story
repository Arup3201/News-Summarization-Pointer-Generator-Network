A woman who pretended to be an heiress to a $100 million fortune and allegedly scammed businesses out of thousands of dollars is finally facing sentencing after years of lies.

Nydia Neubauer, 66, could get decades behind bars when she is sentenced in Bucks County Court, Pennsylvania on Tuesday for swindling companies out of more than $100,000 in jewelry, real estate, clothes and car rentals.

She pleaded guilty in December to charges including identity theft, bad checks and forgery - a decade after she first hit headlines for similar scams in New York City, such as ordering expensive furs or pledging eye-watering sums to charities that she then failed to pay.

Locked up: Nydia Neubauer, 66, will be sentenced on Tuesday for allegedly pretending to be an heiress (right in her passport photo) as she scammed local businesses out of hundreds of thousands of dollars

Under a series of aliases, she allegedly tricked socialite and philanthropist Denise Rich and the nephew of fashion
 Tommy Hilfiger and was still under investigation when she was arrested in 2010.

After leaving New York City, she had moved to Bucks County, where residents did not know of her past scandals, and convinced them that she was a millionaire widow.

Among her victims was Linda Jagiela, who owned a car service in Marlton and provided Neubauer a driver for any route she needed.

Jagiela told the Philadelphia Inquirer that she found Neubauer eccentric - like many of the wealthy clients she catered to - but that she had no reason to doubt her.

She said that Neubauer traveled with a maid and two dogs, and often spoke about her numerous homes and celebrity friends.

But Jagiela soon learned she would never be paid for her service; Neubauer used a credit 
card from a British bank with a deferred payment date and checks bounced. She eventually lost $3,500.

Charged: Neubauer, pictured after her arrest in September 2010, has remained in jail because she was unable to post bail. She faces decades behind bars when she is sentenced - but will likely get less

Neubauer was arrested in September 2010 in Belmar, New Jersey when she failed to pay for dinner. She was transferred to Bucks County, where she has been since last year after failing to post bail.

Jagiela said she will be at the sentencing to make sure she goes to jail.

'I'll probably keep an eye on her for the rest of my life,' Jagiela said. If not, 'she will do this again and again and again'.

Bucks County Assistant District Attorney Jay Karsch told the Inquirer that Neubauer had not appeared like a typical criminal.

'Here's somebody who apparently [claims to have] a lot of money, whose husband died and left her $100 million or so,' Karsch said. 'So, she wants to buy jewelry? Sure, I'll sell her jewelry.'

Last year, she pleaded guilty to 10 
counts of access device fraud, 10 counts of theft of services, three 
counts of forgery, two counts of theft by deception, one count of 
identity theft and one count of knowingly issuing bad checks.

At the time, she told the judge, her family had raised about $85,000 of the $190,000 she owed.

She could face dozens of years in prison when she is sentenced, the prosecutor said, but she is likely to get less.

In the New York cases, she had allegedly written a series of bad checks and asked to borrow credit cards before disappearing, Page Six reported. She was eventually thrown out of a hotel after trying to pay with a credit card in a different name.

Acquaintances told the New York Times in 2002 about her questionable manner, such as the way she dressed or how she would often say she was friends with people who did not know her.

Among them, Phyllis Keitlen, a fundraiser for Denise Rich's charity, 
claimed Nydia pledged $150,000, but 'when we tried to cash
 the check, she stopped payment'.

'When I went after her, she gave me
 false wire transfer numbers twice,' she continued. 'It was completely unfair what 
she had done to Denise, whose daughter died of leukemia.'

At the time, Neubauer responded: 'The people around me all wanted money. I spent a large amount of money... All these people came in like sharks... I felt pressure.

'Most of the checks did bounce. I can't deny that... I'm sorry the situation happened. It is my fault. But I never could believe these people were so devious.'
