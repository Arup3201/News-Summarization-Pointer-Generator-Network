Gassing: Missouri prisoners on death row could face the gas chamber when drug supplies run out

Prisoners on death row in Missouri are facing possible execution in the gas chamber due to a dwindling supply of lethal-injection drugs in the state.

The state’s attorney general, Chris Koster, is pressuring the Supreme Court into carrying out pending executions under its current lethal-injection protocol before the drug supplies run out.

It comes in the wake of a boycott on sales of medical drugs for executions by drugs companies in the U.S, Europe and Asia, which have refused on ethical grounds to sell their products to corrections departments.

The European Commission has also imposed tougher restrictions on the export of anaesthetics to the U.S, banning the export of drugs for lethal injection in 2011, under the EU Torture Regulation.

In a statement this week, Koster said the state will be forced to start using the gas chamber as an alternative. 

‘Unless
the [supreme] court changes its current course, the legislature will 
soon be compelled to fund statutorily-authorised alternative methods of 
execution to carry out lawful judgments,’ Koster said.

Under
Missouri law only two forms of execution are permitted, ‘by means of 
the administration of lethal gas or by means of the administration of 
lethal injection’, he said.

After
switching from hanging in 1937 as its preferred method of judicial 
killing, the gas chamber has not been used in the state since 1965. The 
use of lethal injection was first used in Texas in 1982.

Chris Koster, the Attorney General of Missouri, wants to bring back the gas chamber

Two methods of lethal injection exist
today, one using a three-drug protocol and another using one large dose
of a barbiturate or propofol – the latter being the drug that the ‘King
of Pop’, Michael Jackson, overdosed on.

Last year Missouri became the only state in the country to apply the execution protocol using just one large dose of propofol. 

However,
the new protocol was challenged by 21 of the state’s death row inmates,
who argued it was a violation of the US constitution as it created the 
likelihood of ‘foreseeable infliction of excruciating pain in the course
of executing the plaintiffs’, according to The Guardian.

That
caused the Missouri supreme court to refuse to schedule any more 
execution dates until the question of the constitutionality of the new 
method of death is settled.

But now the state's limited supply of propofol is running out.

According to Koster, the Department of Corrections has only three quantities of propofol remaining.

The oldest quantity expires this October, the next batch expires in May 2014, and the newest supply expires in 2015.

Earlier this week, on July 1, Koster filed new motions asking the judges to give him the green light to carry out the executions of two death row inmates, Joseph Paul Franklin and Allen Nicklasson, before the drugs expire.

Fraklin, 63, is a serial killer who has been linked to 20 murders, six aggravated assaults, 16 bank robberies and two bombings.

Nicklasson, 42, killed three people in 1994 who had offered to help him when his car broke down on the road to Kansas City.

‘Not only has the delay prevented those affected by Mr Nicklasson’s crimes from receiving the closure they deserve, it has also put at risk the  State’s ability to administer capital punishment at all,’ said Koster in the motion.

Richard Dieter, of the Death Penalty Information Center, said he believes the threats of bringing back the gas chamber are a political ploy, directed at the state supreme court.

‘He's trying to prod the court into dropping its objections and setting execution dates by threatening that Missouri might have to go back to the dark ages if they don't act soon," Dieter told The Guardian.

Each state that employs lethal injection is legally required to have detailed protocols for its practice, and though the set of rules differ from state to state, the process of killing a condemned inmate varies little.

It begins with the lethal injection team securing the inmate to a gurney and connecting him to an electrocardiogram (EKG) machine that monitors heart activity.

Inserted into the inmate's veins are two intravenous lines (one as a backup) that lead out of a separate infusion room, where members of the intravenous team monitor the initial harmless saline drip.

At the warden's signal, the execution chamber is exposed to witnesses in an adjoining room, and in states that use the three-drug protocol the inmate is injected with sodium thiopental or pentobarbital, anesthetics intended to put the inmate to sleep.

Presumably after a member of the intravenous team determines the inmate is sufficiently unconscious, he is then injected with pancuronium bromide, which paralyses the entire muscle system and stops the inmate's breathing.

In most cases, the inmate's consciousness is again checked, and finally potassium chloride stops his heart. In ideal circumstances, death results from anesthetic overdose and respiratory and cardiac arrest while the condemned person is unconscious.

The process of lethal injection using just one drug follows nearly the same procedure, except the inmate dies from the one large dose of anesthetic, either sodium thiopental or pentobarbital.
