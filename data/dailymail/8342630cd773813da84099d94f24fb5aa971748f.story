Borussia Dortmund are officially the worst team in the Bundesliga. So says the league table and, of course, that never lies.

After Sunday's 2-0 defeat by Eintracht Frankfurt, Dortmund are rock bottom of the league, having amassed only 11 points from 13 games. Even their famous fans, who have stuck by the team throughout this nightmare season, have begun to boo and whistle their players.

On Sunday evening, director of sport Michael Zorc has conceded the club are 'in the middle of a relegation fight', but what are the reasons for Dortmund's downfall, and could they really find themselves in the second division in May?

The manager

Jurgen Klopp has seemed ever more helpless in the past weeks, as he watched his team stumble from catastrophe to catastrophe. 

His job remains safe, and he insisted this weekend that he wouldn't resign, saying he takes 'full responsibility' for his team's woes. He has to say that, but it is difficult to ignore the errors he has made.

Klopp the tactician, having experimented with 4-1-4-1 at the start of the season, reverted quickly to 4-2-3-1, and has not changed since. He is now being accused of lacking a Plan B. 

Klopp the motivator, meanwhile, has failed to exploit the successes in Europe and the victory against Borussia Monchengladbach in order to break his side's psychological rut against smaller teams. 

He is still linked with jobs in the Barclays Premier League or with the national team, but the longer the current crisis goes on, the more one asks: how much does anyone else really want him?

The players

One of the reasons it has taken Dortmund fans so long to boo their team is because there has been no lack of effort on the part of the players. 

Statistically, Dortmund have run more kilometers than any other team in the league, and they are clearly desperate to give the 'blood, sweat and tears' which chief executive Hans Joachim Watzke demanded of them last week.

Ciro Immobile has scored only six goals this season, and is struggling with the Klopp system, while World Cup winner Matthias Ginter is having  problems with the step up from Freiburg.

It was his mistake which cost Dortmund the first goal against Frankfurt on Sunday.

The playing style

Klopp's famous Gegenpressing, the art of pushing high up the pitch without the ball and striking ruthlessly in the transition, has been fine against teams like Bayern, Gladbach and their Champions League opponents. 

These teams attack more, and give Dortmund the space which they so love to exploit behind the defence. 

Most of the worst defeats have come against theoretically inferior opposition, who have kept Dortmund out efficiently and mercilessly punished the endless mistakes at the back.

Ginter is not alone in this regard – all of Dortmund's defenders have cost their team at one point or another through silly errors. 

If Klopp is to fix this mess, he needs to adapt his playing style for defensive teams. At the moment, he seems unable to.

The results

Even with the sloppy defence, one thing is notable about all the nightmare results Dortmund have endured this year. 

They have not lost by more than two goals this year, and often have the lion's share of the chances. Defeats like the 2-1 against Cologne, the 1-0 against Hannover and the 2-0 against Mainz could have been turned into victories if Dortmund had had a better conversion rate. 

The same could be said of the 2-2 draws against Paderborn and Stuttgart. Once again, the likes of Immobile and Aubameyang have not been up to scratch as replacements for the injured Reus and the transferred Lewandowski.

The future

It is now officially a relegation battle for Dortmund. As Zorc put it: 'Until now, we've kept an eye on how far we are from the top in terms of points. We can stop doing that now.' 

Chief executive Watzke told shareholders last week that one season out of the Champions League would be no problem for Dortmund financially; relegation, on the other hand, would be disastrous, both for the sporting and the financial sides of things. 

In terms of this season, the team needs to haul itself out of the relegation zone. Klopp will stay, but he needs to make changes.

The team need more tactical clarity at the back, and potentially a better goalscorer come the January transfer window.

There are enough poor teams in the Bundesliga to think that Dortmund will not go down. They are still showing fight, and their Champions League performances have shown that the side still has a lot of class. 

But changes are needed, and it's not like there isn't a precedent for this. 

Nuremberg were relegated as champions in 1969; Bayer Leverkusen narrowly avoided relegation one year after reaching the Champions League Final in 2002, and Schalke finished only 14th when they reached the semi finals in 2011. Dortmund beware.
