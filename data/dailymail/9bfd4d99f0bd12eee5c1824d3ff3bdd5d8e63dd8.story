Ravi Bopara has leapt to the defence of Alastair Cook after England’s crushing one-day defeat by Sri Lanka in Colombo was followed by renewed demands for his resignation.

Kevin Pietersen, Ian Botham and Michael Vaughan all called for Cook to quit after the Sri Lankans moved with embarrassing ease into a 2-0 lead in the seven-match series.

But Bopara, whose enterprising half-century stood out in a sorry display, said Cook was not the only struggling batsman in England’s one-day side. In a formulation that has become familiar, Bopara insisted: ‘He’s quite a strong character. He’ll come out the other side.’

If England keep losing and Alastair Cook keeps failing, his position as one-day captain will come under serious pressure.

If England do dispense with his services, expect Alex Hales to replace him as opener and Eoin Morgan to replace him as captain for the World Cup Down Under in February, even though the Irishman also looks out of form.

Few doubt Cook’s mental strength. But his lack of runs and England’s faltering preparations for the World Cup, now less than three months away, appear to be a concern only to those outside the dressing-room.

Cook’s scratchy 22 in 37 balls on Saturday meant he has scored only one half-century in 16 innings since guiding England to the final of the Champions Trophy on home soil in June 2013.

And – with the surprising exception of Joe Root – that record compares unfavourably with the rest of the current top seven over the same period.

In 16 innings since the Champions Trophy, Cook has averaged 29, with a lowly strike-rate per 100 balls of 71. Only Root averages fewer (27), but none of the top seven has scored more slowly than the captain 

Bopara finds it easy to retain faith in a cricketer like captain Cook who has a career trait of resilience

By contrast, Moeen Ali is averaging 43 with a strike-rate of almost 107, while Jos Buttler’s figures are 40 and 115. Even Ian Bell, whose place has been questioned while the likes of Alex Hales and James Taylor wait for their chance, has been scoring at 90 runs per 100 balls.

Bopara, though, was toeing a loyal line. ‘One thing we must remember, it’s not just Alastair Cook who hasn’t scored over the past few games,’ he said. ‘There’s been a lot of us.

‘He is our captain. He’s done it in the past. I remember him scoring two hundreds on the bounce in the UAE. He can play, and I’m sure that form will turn around.’

Cook will have to do so without the help of batting coach Mark Ramprakash, who on Sunday night left the tour as per his part-time deal with the ECB.

England have lost 15 of their 25 ODIs since they were beaten by India at home in the final of the Champions Trophy in June 2013.

They have won just nine, with one no result.

Asked about the views of Botham, Vaughan and Pietersen – who tweeted ‘Dear Alastair, if you care about England's chances this winter, pls resign and just concentrate on Test cricket... ‪#getHalesin’ – Bopara was philosophical.

‘Everyone’s entitled to their opinion,’ he said. ‘In English culture, we’re quite quick to jump on something that hasn’t gone right. What’s happened to Cook over the past year has definitely made him stronger. He smiles a lot more now than he ever did. I think he’s in a good place.’

Bopara himself may be in a better place than when England dropped him for the home one-day series against India at the end of the summer.

He has begun this series with a pair of fifties, and worked out more quickly than his colleagues that Saturday’s pitch required careful accumulation – not the gung-ho strokeplay that scuppered England’s top order.

‘Getting dropped against India was a shock,’ he said. ‘I remember the phonecall quite clearly. I didn’t really want to tell anyone, to be honest. I was a little bit embarrassed.

‘I get dropped a lot, actually. I think I come back wiser every time, and a little bit more independent. That’s the key to playing cricket at this level: you’ve got to be very independent and not be so coach-driven.’

After being given a run at No 4 in 2012, Bopara’s role in the one-day side has been as a finisher, or a repairer of innings, from No 6 or 7. His natural gifts are well suited to both tasks, but he is clearly underwhelmed by the designation.

‘I’d like to bat a bit higher,’ he said. ‘It’s an OK role. It’s not a glorious role. You’re not quite a main batter or a main bowler. At Essex I play as a main batsman – that’s how I like to be viewed. But the role I’m given – there’s nothing I can do about it.

‘I could do with a little bit of help down the back end, I think. It would be nice to be batting with someone like Jos Buttler or Eoin Morgan.’

Right now, these are luxuries England may not be in a position to consider.
