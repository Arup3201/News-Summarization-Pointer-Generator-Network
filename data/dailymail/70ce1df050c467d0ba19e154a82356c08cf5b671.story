New York in the fall and winter can be brutal and bundled up commuters generally walk briskly past one another avoiding any eye contact.

A little girl warmed up the usually drab Subway platform on the L train at Bedford in Williamsburg last month as she danced to music by Subway buskers and started a hoedown in the process.

The band Coyote, who was playing a Grateful Dead Cover of 'Me & My Uncle,' posted the video of the New York moment on YouTube and the video now has over 200,000 views.

The little girl who started it all can be seen dressed all in pink and grooving out to the band's tune. A green haired woman dances along with her.

It doesn't take much time before other people waiting for the train join in and dance too.

At the end of the song the crowd is all in smiles and claps for the girl. Likely they'll be getting on the subway feeling a little bit lighter inside.  

Instigator: This little girl can't help but dance her little heart out to buskers on the subway platform 

taking notice: Commuters on the platform can't help but smile at the girl and shortly they'll be dancing too 

All aboard: The little girl's dance moves are contagious and other people waiting for the train can't help but join her in her spontaneous dance 

Unanimous applause: When the song is over everyone is clapping and smiling and the little girl jumps happily into her proud papa's arms
