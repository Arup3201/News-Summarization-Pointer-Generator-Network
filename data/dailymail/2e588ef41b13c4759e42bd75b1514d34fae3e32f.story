A cow was last night said to be recovering in a field after a chair-raising ordeal that saw its head get stuck in a plastic seat.

RSPCA workers rushed to the scene, in Appin, southwest of Sydney, after a farmer spotted the stricken beast blinking gormlessly with the piece of garden furniture locked around its neck.

The more it tried to free itself from the chair's clutches, the more trapped it became.

Chair-raising: RSPCA workers rushed to the scene, in Appin, southwest of Sydney, after a farmer spotted the stricken beast blinking gormlessly with the piece of garden furniture locked around its neck

Struggle: The more it tried to free itself from the chair's clutches, the more trapped it became

Worn out: Finally, worn out and dehydrated, the animal gave up and waited for help in the shade of a tree.

Some of its bovine field-mates even 
tried to nuzzle the seat away with their noses but their sympathetic 
efforts were to no avail.

In the end, worn out and dehydrated, the animal gave up and waited for help in the shade of a tree.

The RSPCA New South Wales Inspectors tranquilised the cow before moving in to delicately remove the piece of furniture from around her neck.

'We're not sure how the cow came to be imprisoned by the plastic chair, but left unattended she would have become severely dehydrated,' RSPCA NSW Inspector Aaron Purcell said.

Mystery: It is unclear how the cow got itself stuck in the chair

Free at last: The cow looked a little dazed following the removal but RSPCA officers said they expected it to make a full recovery

'Other members of the herd were also visibly distressed by the cow's 
predicament with several of them trying to remove the chair with their 
noses,' Purcell added.

This is the second incident in which RSPCA NSW Inspectors were required to remove an item from the head of a cow.

In June this year, inspectors had to free a cow from a fibreglass toilet on a property in Bringelly.

'We'd like to take this opportunity to remind residents on, or near rural properties, to take care with the disposal of household items as they can become hazardous to livestock and pets,' Purcell concluded.
