Bolton have captured Crystal Palace centre-back Paddy McCarthy on loan until the end of the season, who was the subject of a prank call by a man impersonating Neil Lennon.

West Brom manager Tony Pulis seemingly fell victim to a call from prankster Blain Morrison pretending to be the Bolton boss and requested taking Baggies defender Gareth McAuley on loan.

Pulis refused to consider letting McAuley leave during the call last month but instead suggested Bolton pursue McCarthy from his former side Crystal Palace and remarkably Lennon has appeared to seize upon the opportunity and has signed the Irishman.

McCarthy has twice spent loan spells at Sheffield United this season but will now link up with Bolton

The 31-year-old defender has been at Selhurst Park since 2008, but has found his first team opportunities limited since Palace's promotion to the Premier League.

McCarthy has twice spent loan spells at Sheffield United this season, but joins Lennon's Championship side and goes into the squad to face Blackburn Rovers.

He will join up with fellow Eagles loanee Barry Bannan at Wanderers, with Lennon's outfit currently 17th position in a tight Championship table.

The Trotters are also keen on a deal for Chelsea youngster Islam Feruz but face competition from Cardiff and Bolton for his signature.

Feruz is highly rated at Chelsea but their resolve to keep him will be tested next month.
