Bermane Stiverne has been released from University Medical Centre where he had been taken after losing his WBC heavyweight title to Deontay Wilder on Saturday night.

Stiverne looked a shadow of the fighter who twice beat Chris Arreola, latterly to win the title, as he lost a wide points decision at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.

He was taken to the nearby hospital and treated for severe dehydration while his promoter Don King revealed that former champion Larry Holmes had texted him during the fight to urge him to have water poured on Stiverne.

‘It turns out that Larry Holmes is a very wise and observant man and knows of that of which he speaks,’ King told Yahoo Sports. ‘I came over to the hospital as soon as I heard, and they’re saying it was amazing that he was able to stand up; this explains to me why he fought the way that he did.

‘I’m watching him and I’m saying to myself, “Where is the guy who fought Arreola twice?”.

‘We didn’t see that guy and I was shocked. Now, we know why.’

Meanwhile, Wilder will have scans to determine whether he broke his right hand in the fight.

Wilder was in control for the vast majority of the fight while Stiverne struggled to make an impression

According to a report in the Tuscaloosa News, the Alabama native was sent for an X-ray which showed a fracture in the knuckle area of his ring finger.

He will be examined by Dr Joseph Sherrill who previously operated on the new world champion’s hand in 2009.

Wilder’s manager Jay Deas said: ‘We won’t know the extent of the injury until we get more information but we don’t think it will keep him out of training long.

‘He was going to be off to heal up after a very difficult fight. Now is a great time to get everything fixed. We don’t expect any change in the schedule, which would have him back in the ring in the summertime.'

Wilder's ram-rod jab was the cornerstone to his success as he boxed cleverly throughout the 12 rounds
