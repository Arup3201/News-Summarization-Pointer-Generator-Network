The Lib Dems are in court today to suppress further allegations about sexual misconduct by one of their MPs.

The party is already accused of trying to hush up details of the claims against Mike Hancock, who is said to have made sexual advances toward a vulnerable constituent. Although the allegations were first made three years ago, the MP was not suspended until this week when a report into the case was leaked online.

Yesterday there were accusations of a second cover-up after Lib Dem-controlled Portsmouth Council – where Mr Hancock is a councillor – said it would ask the High Court to halt the release of the independent report.

The move will cost taxpayers thousands of pounds even when a redacted version of the document is online. Written by a QC, it found ‘credible’ evidence that the 67-year-old was guilty of ‘serious and unwelcome sexual behaviour’.

The 39-year-old alleged victim, known as Annie or AH, is in the midst of a civil case against the MP which she launched after police decided not to pursue the matter.

Yesterday the mother-of-one told the Mail that Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg’s handling of the affair was ‘absolutely disgusting’ and she had considered taking her own life.

She said she felt ‘hugely let down’, adding: ‘The Lib Dems have tried to sweep my complaints under the carpet. This should have been dealt with ages ago, in 2010, when I first came forward, rather than now.

‘The whole of their party should all be held to account and they should hang their heads in shame.’

Much of Nigel Pascoe’s report, commissioned by the council for a code-of-conduct review into Mr Hancock, was blacked out when it was leaked online – and AH has applied to see it all.

The Tory and Labour groups on Portsmouth Council want the report to be published, but they were overruled by Lib Dem colleagues, who say solicitors have told them this should not happen until the civil case is over.

Mr Pascoe said there was no reason it should be kept under wraps.

Last night the Conservative councillor who fought for the report to be published accused the Lib Dems of a cover-up.

Donna Jones said the party operated as an old boys’ club interested only in protecting their own interests at the expense of women.

And she said the leader of the council, Gerald Vernon-Jackson, was a personal friend of senior Lib Dem Vince Cable – meaning it was inconceivable the leadership in London did not know the seriousness of the allegations.

She chaired a committee with two Lib Dem councillors that reviewed complaints against Mr Hancock and said she was ‘blocked at every turn’ and then outvoted on the issue of publishing the report.

‘Mike Hancock’s position has become completely untenable given the allegations against him, particularly against a vulnerable adult,’ Miss Jones told the Mail. ‘This smacks of the Lord Rennard case. It’s all about cover-up and protecting the party’s own interests at a cost to women.’

Mr Hancock was suspended on Wednesday night by his party’s HQ in London. However, as of last night, he had not been stripped of his role as cabinet member for planning on Portsmouth Council.

Michael Lawther, solicitor for Portsmouth Council, said: ‘Disclosure of the report is not necessary for the court to deal with the [civil] case – it can hear and test the evidence from both sides.

‘The report is part of the council’s code-of-conduct process, which has been adjourned. It would be wrong for the report to be released before councillors holding a code-of-conduct hearing have been able to consider it and come to a decision.

‘The council has to deal fairly and responsibly with the information it holds. It is not the council’s practice to disclose material as part of a court case in which it is not involved.’ 

Conservative councillor Donna Jones said: 'This smacks of the Lord Rennard (pictured) case. It's all about cover-up and protecting the party's own interests at a cost to women'

Local Lib Dems were last night standing behind Mr Hancock and spoke out to criticise the party leadership. Simon Dodd, chairman of Portsmouth Lib Dems, said: ‘Mike Hancock has loyally represented the people of Portsmouth for over 40 years and he will continue to serve as an excellent constituency MP and as a councillor.’

It emerged yesterday that Mr Clegg had known about the latest allegations since February last year – but had done nothing to discipline Mr Hancock.

He recently told his radio phone-in: ‘We did receive a letter in February this year: you’re right, we did receive a fuller letter from the complainant in February this year and I asked the chief whip to look into it.’

Last night Mr Vernon-Jackson refused to respond to media enquiries about his role in the Hancock case or the MP’s future in Portsmouth.

It is believed Mr Hancock’s fate as independent councillor and cabinet member for planning, regeneration and economic redevelopment will be decided at a meeting tonight.

October 2009 - The woman, known as AH,  meets Mike Hancock for the first time at his surgery to ask for help over dispute with  neighbours.

February 2010 - Mr Hancock first visits  AH’s house.

March 2010 - The MP takes the woman and her son on a visit to Parliament. He gives her  a teddy bear as a present and starts sending her text messages.

June 2010 - AH has a hysterectomy.

July 2010 - She makes first complaint about his behaviour to her family support worker. This is passed to the police.

September 2010 - AH asks police to open inquiries into Mr Hancock.

December 2010 - AH is told that police will not take action.

March 2011 - She writes to Lib Dem HQ for the first time about the allegations. No action is taken.

2012 – Lib Dems decide not to take the case further.

February 2013 - Nick Clegg’s office receives a letter from AH’s solicitor detailing the case. He accepts he received this.

June 2013 - Mr Hancock resigns the Lib Dem whip after AH launches a civil case.
