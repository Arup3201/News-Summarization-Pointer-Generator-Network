A woman has swallowed part of a dead mouse before realising the rodent was wrapped up in her handmade rice paper roll.

The Gold Coast mother took two bites  before she tasted fur in the $5.50 'summer chicken' roll on Sunday.

She did not initially notice the tail sticking out one end of the healthy snack.

The woman's daughter Emilie Petrusic told the Gold Coast Bulletin: 'It’s like it’s been planted because they hand-make those things — how can a whole animal be inside it?'

A Gold Coast Woman bought the $5.50 summer chicken roll on Sunday 

The horrified shopper claims she bought the roll from Woolworths in Broadbeach on the Gold Coast, Queensland, but the shop has told Gold Coast Bulletin the mouse must have got into the roll after it left the store.

'If it was in fact inside the roll, that happened after it left the store,' they said in a statement.

Local authorities are now looking into the incident and the woman is receiving medical checks.

Despite the shocking photographs, public health boss Dr Paul Van Buynder has warned: 'We really can’t say whether this is real or not at this time but we will continue with this process.'

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Ms Petrusic for comment. 

Just last week in Russia a man found a dead mouse inside a sausage he had used to make himself a sandwich.

Anatol Voronkov, 28, had already munched his way through half the 'high quality meat product' when he spotted something dark lurking inside.

He realised it was a mouse or young rat and then showed his wife who was physically sick.

'I thought it was a pepper, but then I realised it was the foot of a rodent. And worse, I then found the foot was attached to the rest of the animal in the middle of the sausage,' said Mr Voronkov.

'I felt really sick but the only good thing was that I was the only one who ate it, and my wife and kids hadn't touched it. And although I felt sick, when I showed my wife she really was sick.'

He said he 'thought it was a pepper, but then I realised it was the foot of a rodent'

The rodent is being tested for diseases after the shocking incident
