A British rugby player has been killed following a hit and run accident, Italian police have confirmed.

Brendan Lynch, 26, who played for Gloucester and Rotherham Titans suffered fatal injuries after he was knocked form his Honda SH300 scooter in the early hours of the morning.

Mr Lynch had moved to Rome recently and played for Capitolina, the city's main rugby club and he also worked for the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation which is based in the Italian capital.

He was considered to be one of the best tighthead props in Italian rugby and was a regular first team player for Capitolina - whose facilities have been used by England for practice ahead of the Six Nations match against Italy.

Police said that Mr Lynch's scooter was hit by another car as he travelled on the Rome ring road near Settebagni just to the north of the capital and the vehicle had then sped off leaving him fatally injured by the side of the road.

Passing motorists alerted emergency services but he was declared dead at the scene.

Traffic police spokesman Roberto Ferilli said: 'We are investigating the circumstances of the accident and are appealing for any witnesses to contact us.

'We are also using cctv footage from the motorway to identify the vehicle. It appears the scooter he was travelling on was hit by another vehicle which failed to stop.'

On its website Capitolina paid tribute to Mr Lynch adding that as a mark of respect it was cancelling all training sessions and club activities for 24 hours.

Despite being born in Rotherham and having British citizenship Mr Lynch had also played for Ireland's Under 19 thanks to his Irish ancestors.

A spokesman for the British Embassy in Rome said: 'I can confirm the death of a British national in a road traffic accident - other than that there is nothing else we can say.'

A friend of Mr Lynch's, who asked not to be named, paid tribute to him and said: 'He was a really nice guy, really friendly and always had a smile.

'He enjoyed playing rugby and was a popular member of the club. He will be sadly missed.'
