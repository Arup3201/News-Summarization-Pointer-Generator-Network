Admission: The former American ambassador to Mali, Vicki Huddleston, says France paid $17 million in ransoms to free French hostages

The former American ambassador to Mali says France paid $17 million in ransoms to free French hostages and that the money ended up in the hands of the same al-Qaeda militants the country is fighting now.

In an interview that aired Friday on iTele, Vicki Huddleston said the money allowed al-Qaeda's  North Africa branch to flourish in Mali.

'Two years ago, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) kidnapped a number of French citizens at a uranium mine in Niger,' she said.

'To get them freed, France paid a 17-million-dollar ransom. Like all ransoms, it was paid indirectly, through the Malian government, which forwarded at least some of the funds to the Salafists [Islamists],' said Ms Huddleston, who was U.S. ambassador to Mali from 2002 to 2005.

Claude Gueant, who was French President Nicolas Sarkozy's chief of staff at the time, today denied that France had ever paid a ransom.

He said intermediaries had been negotiating to free the hostages.

The hostage's Ms Huddleston is referring to were were taken from the Arlit uranium mine on September 
16, 2010, according to France 24.

A further two were taken at Hombori in Mali in November 2011 and the seventh in November 2012 at Kayes, also in Mali.

All seven are believed to be held in north-east of Mali near the Algerian border.

France launched a military operation 
on January 11 to help Mali's government wrest control from Islamic 
extremists linked to al-Qaeda.

The retreating rebels are holding Western hostages, including eight who are French.

Meanwhile this morning a suicide bomber has blew himself up in the northern Mali town of Gao - the country's first such case.

The man was on a motorbike and blew 
himself up at a Malian government military checkpoint 100 km (60 miles) 
north of the northern city of Gao on Friday, injuring one soldier, a 
Mali military officer said.

It
would be the first reported suicide bombing since a French-led 
intervention swept Islamist rebels from their desert strongholds of Gao,
Timbuktu and Kidal.

'A kamikaze on a motorbike just blew himself up at the Bourem checkpoint at 6:30 am (0630 GMT).

'One lightly wounded soldier from Gao,' the officer told Reuters by text message. 

Meanwhile
heavy gunfire erupted in the west of Mali's capital Bamako today as 
government forces exchanged fire with mutinous paratroopers, military 
sources and witnesses said.

Government
forces sealed off the area around the paratroopers' base, as 
reinforcements arrived to quell the mutiny which was protesting 
disciplinary measures against some of the unit's members.

Smoke was seen rising from the camp.

Since a military coup in March last 
year that plunged Mali into chaos and led to the occupation of the north
by Tuareg and Islamist rebels, paratroopers loyal to former President 
Amadou Toumani Toure had been largely sidelined and some arrested.

"The
Chief of Staff had taken a disciplinary measure against some of the 
paratroopers, and some of them were not happy with the decision so they 
woke up this morning and started shooting," a Malian defense ministry 
official told Reuters.

The
shooting in the southern capital Bamako occurred while French and 
Chadian troops hunted Islamist rebels hundreds of kilometres (miles) to 
the north in the second phase of a French-led military operation against
al Qaeda-allied insurgents.

In Bamako, groups of the 
paratroopers, who wear red berets, had been staging protests to demand 
that commanders send them to the front to join the offensive against the
Islamists.

The French-led 
military operation involving 4,000 French troops backed by warplanes 
successfully pushed the Islamist rebels out of the main towns of 
northern Mali, but driving them from their mountain bases could prove a 
tougher task.

France 
and its western allies are pushing for a national political settlement 
and democratic elections to stabilise the situation in the West Africa 
state, where interim civilian leaders have faced interference from March
coup leader Captain Amadou Sanogo and other junta officers.

In
May, Sanogo's troops said they put down a counter-coup attempt led by 
paratroopers which led to several days of fighting in the riverside 
capital in which at least 27 people were killed.
