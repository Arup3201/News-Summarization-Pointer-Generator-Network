Must see: The West End revival of Miss Saigon smashed box office records taking £4.5million at the box office in one day. Pictured is a UK touring version of the show in 2004

The forthcoming revival of  the hit musical Miss Saigon has claimed a new theatrical record with the largest single day’s sales for a West End production.

Tickets went on sale at 10am and by yesterday afternoon the show – returning to London in May next year after an absence of more than a decade – had already passed £4.4million at the box office.

The previous record was set in March when The Book Of Mormon took £2.1million in a day.

Producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh said: ‘I’m truly flabbergasted with the box office take.

'I knew people loved Miss Saigon and had taken it to their hearts but this is beyond my wildest dreams.

‘The atmosphere down at the theatre today is full of excitement and I can’t wait to bring my new production back to the West End.’

Sir Cameron said that for a lot of people the Vietnamese War drama was the one great musical they had never seen.

‘There are several generations who have only heard about it,’ he added.

The show will begin its run at the Prince Edward Theatre on May 3 – 25 years after the production first opened in the West End – and tickets are being sold up to October 25 next year.

The musical by Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg has been seen in 300 cities around the world.

It tells the story of a Vietnamese bar girl who falls in love with an American soldier but their lives are torn apart as a result of the fall of Saigon.

The show ran for ten years first time around, and is seen as one of the great unseen musicals for many.

Casting for the 2014 revival has not yet been announced.

Big hit: The record was previously held by The Book of Mormon which racked up £2.1million sales in a day back in March
