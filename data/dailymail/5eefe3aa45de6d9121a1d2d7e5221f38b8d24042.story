There are many benefits of being a successful Formula One driver: fast cars, a multi-million pound salary and experiencing life in a multitude of countries and cities.

Lewis Hamilton can now add a trip to the White House and a meeting with the President of the USA, Barack Obama, to that list.

The Mercedes driver, who is vying to win the World Championship for the second time in his career, took advantage of a four-week gap between races to join girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger in Washington DC on Thursday. 

Scherzinger, the singer and X Factor judge was invited by the President to celebrate the work of Special Olympics, for whom she is a Global Ambassador.

The sports organisation helps children mostly with, but also some without, intellectual disabilities to train and compete in a wide variety of sports and activities. They also hold the Special Olympics World Games both in summer and winter.

Last week’s function saw a concert from Katy Perry, who performed hits including ‘Firework’ and ‘This Moment’, before dedicating her performance to a ‘unified generation’. 

Hamilton and Scherzinger took to their respective Instagram accounts to show themselves rubbing shoulders with the likes of Stevie Wonder, as well as a shot of President Obama’s speech. The pair can also be seen together enjoying a drink and sitting at their table.

The British driver appeared most excited about meeting the President and the First Lady, calling the experience both an ‘honour’ and a ‘pleasure’. He added how proud he was of his partner and the work she does for the organisation.

Hamilton currently stands 11 points behind German team-mate Nico Rosberg in the drivers’ standings.
