Sports ethics campaigner Jaimie Fuller is hoping to shame FIFA sponsors into backing calls for reform after turning his guns on football’s tarnished world governing body.

Fuller, chairman and owner of compression sportswear market leaders SKINS, played a part in changing cycling’s governance and in the battle against doping. His focus is now on changing FIFA after meeting fellow Australian Bonita Mersiades, who blew the whistle on World Cup corruption.

The sports industry leader, who will attend the Brussels summit next week organised by Tory MP Damian Collins to debate a new FIFA, will write to all FIFA sponsors and related football companies urging them to join the reform bandwagon.

Fuller said: ‘I feel it is my duty as part of the industry to call the sports governing bodies to account for their conduct. It’s a disgrace how many influential voices prefer to keep quiet.

‘I know it is highly unlikely that Sepp Blatter will be usurped, but it’s worth the effort and I’m in this for the long haul to try to improve football’s leadership, as we did with cycling.’

Sceptics will see Fuller’s involvement as a platform to promote the aims of SKINS, who will be launching their own anti-Blatter campaign. He doesn’t deny those opportunities exist but says any publicity will be far from cheap, given the personal funding involved in the reform projects.

Bookmakers Paddy Power have endorsed David Ginola to challenge Sepp Blatter for the FIFA presidency

Rampant self-publicists Paddy Power will be parading former Spurs and Newcastle star David Ginola as their endorsed candidate for the FIFA presidency on Friday morning in partnership with another Blatter-bashing pressure group, ChangeFIFA.

The bookmakers claim it is not a stunt — fat chance! — but whether their candidate receives the required five nominations from national associations is another matter

England manager Roy Hodgson, who had to abort a player get-together because no date could be agreed, should have held it at the O2 Arena on Thursday night, where 60 Premier League players were on the guest list for the NBA game between the New York Knicks and the Milwaukee Bucks.

Arsenal legend Thiery Henry looked less than impressed by the antics of Bucks mascot Bango

Meanwhile the full house at the O2 — and BT Sport’s decision to extend their NBA coverage — makes a mockery of UK Sport’s withdrawal of funding for elite British basketball because it lacks Olympic medal potential. One hopes UK Sport’s review of their strict criteria will accommodate worthy team sports in future.

The RFU defend having six different England kits in 15 months by saying that every penny made is reinvested in the game. 

The proceeds made from England's ever-changing kits won't necessarily benefit all fans

So what is the latest renovation taking place at Twickenham? A complete refurbishment ahead of the World Cup of that hub of grass-roots rugby — the royal box.

THIS GIRL'S GONE VIRAL 

Sport England’s This Girl Can campaign has exceeded 5,000,000 plays on Facebook since it was launched last Monday — strong evidence of the immediate impact of the £10million project to give women of all shapes, sizes and abilities the confidence to do more sport and exercise.

The bold 90-second video aimed at taking away the fear of sport — with lines such as ‘sweating like a pig, feeling like a fox’ — is targeting women between 14 and 40, a demographic which has 2,000,000 fewer participants in regular sport than its male counterpart.

There has been criticism from national governing bodies that the TV advertising blitz over the next five weeks, and then again in May and June, will not effect enough change to justify the cost. Indeed, some have called it a vanity project for Sport England CEO Jennie Price and Minister for Sport Helen Grant, who approved the funding.

But Price said: ‘We have had fantastic feedback and the cost is minimal compared to what we hand out to sport. This is a much-needed campaign which I’ve wanted to do for some time but needed Government backing for the spend.’

It has caused some consternation in the shires that Yorkshire’s Colin Graves is giving interviews as if he were already in situ as the new chairman of the ECB. That is likely to happen but nominations for the post don’t close until the end of the month and any appointment needs to be ratified by the 41 ECB stakeholders.
