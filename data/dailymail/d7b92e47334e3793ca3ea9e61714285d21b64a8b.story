The population of London is on the verge of reaching an all-time high, finally exceeding the pre-Second World War peak of just over 8.615m.

The Greater London Authority estimates that the city will soon welcome its 8,615,246th inhabitant, the highest population since the eve of the war in 1939.

As the population figure is based on GLA forecasts, experts do not when the exact peak will be - but some say it could even be today.

Population peak: The number of people living in London is on the verge of reaching an all-time high, finally exceeding the pre-Second World War peak of just over 8.615m

The last peak in London's population was on the eve of the Second World War in 1939. Pictured: People enjoying lunch at the open air restaurant at Lincoln's Inn's Fields in 1939 

Statisticians say the record-breaking Londoner is likely to be born in the first few weeks of 2015, in one of the capital's outer boroughs where population growth rates are highest.

The news represents an extraordinary turnaround for London, which lost more than 2million people in the world war and once had a population of just 6.6 million.

The population is now forecast to continue at an annual rate of around 100,000 - the equivalent of a new borough every three years - with the population set to hit 10m by 2030. 

Experts have warned that this could add massive strains to already stressed infrastructure, particularly housing and transport. 

The biggest pressure is expected to be on housing, with an estimated 42,000 new homes needed every year to keep pace with population growth. 

Professor Tony Travers, director of research group LSE London, told the Evening Standard: 'This is both good news and bad. On the one hand it is far better to be living in a city that people want to come to rather than a declining city.

Age: This graph shows how the age of London's population has remained rather steady since 1939, but that we now have fewer teenagers and more pensioners

'But there is always the risk that people will feel there is not enough space, not enough transport, too much congestion.

'Such a large population inevitably means substantial investment in roads, railway, hospitals and all the elements that make a city work.

'Clearly, there is not enough investment going into London at the moment.' 

Barney Stringer, director of planning consultancy Quod, said the peak comes after the city lost a quarter of its population - the equivalent of the inhabitants of Birmingham, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast all leaving. 

Writing about it on his blog, he said: 'London is back to its peak, and while it has changed in so many ways, it faces some of the same challenges.  

Country of birth: This graph shows how many more people from other countries now live in London, compared to 1939 

The tenure of London homes has also changed, with many more owning homes, despite the increase in housing prices 

'Just like 75 years ago we have extraordinarily fast population growth with commuting patterns and housing pressure spilling way beyond the city’s boundaries.'

The last population peak came after two decades of massive growth.

But it began to fall almost immediately after the outbreak of war in September. This was largely due to evacuations and conscription.

Even after the war, the population continued to decline, amid encouragement from planners for families to relocate.   

The last time London's population peaked was in 1939, on the eve of the Second World War. But how different was the UK's capital city back then?

Currently, 13 per cent of people living in the UK are London inhabitants, whereas the London population accounted for 18 per cent of the UK in 1939.

At that time, London was overwhelmingly white - only 2.7 per cent had been born abroad. Today, around 37 per cent of Londoners were born abroad.

In 1939, with no NHS and heavy smog, life expectancy was 62. Today, Londoners can expect to live to 82.

The population pyramid shows London now has fewer teenagers and more pensioners than in 1939. There are also have more adult men, due to a 'missing generation' in 1939, after the First World War.

In 1939, statutory education only went up to age 14, so most of London's  secondary schools had yet to be built.

Before the war, only 2 per cent of people went to university and almost all of them were men. In London today, 43 per cent of people go onto university and the majority of them are women.

Although the number of people working in London has not changed greatly, the industries which cater for those jobs have.

In 1939, around one in three people worked in manufacturing. Now 90 per cent of these manufacturing jobs have gone and most people now work in industries that barely existed in 1939.

These include 250,000 jobs in IT, with another 250,000 working in hotels and restaurants.

St Paul's was the tallest building in the capital In 1939. Now St Paul's is only the 41st tallest building in the London. The tallest building is The Shard. 

House prices have also grown extraordinarily. In 1939, the average cost of a home was the equivalent of three years' salary; now it is around 16 years.
