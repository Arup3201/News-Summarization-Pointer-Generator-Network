Animosity: Dee Presley during 'Elvis: We Love You Tender' Book Party - January 8, 1980 at the Navarro Hotel in New York City, New York

She has been dubbed the King of Rock and Roll's 'evil stepmother' - the lady who waited until after his tragically young death to claim he not only had a gay affair but also engaged in an incestuous relationship with his beloved mother.

Dead at the age of 88 at her home in Nashville, Tennessee, Davada 'Dee' Stanley Presley was the second wife of Elvis's dad Vernon, but as far as his hundreds of millions of fans are concerned she was no better than a gold-digger intent on ruining his stellar legacy.

As for Elvis himself, his dislike bordered on open hate, succinctly summed up by his wife Priscilla, who claimed the King 'couldn't stand her'.

It was only after he was found dead 
on his bathroom floor at his Memphis mansion Graceland in August 1977 
that Dee began to spout her claims about Elvis's private life and drug 
abuse.

In many 
televised appearances and in two much-maligned books, Dee made numerous 
allegations including the unsubstantiated claim that Elvis in fact 
killed himself after discovering he had untreatable bone-marrow cancer.

She
 also said that Elvis's marriage to Priscilla in 1967, already 
controversial for their age difference and speculation about when they 
first went to bed, was forced upon the singer.

Saving
 her most jaw-dropping claims for the 1993 book 'The Intimate Life and 
Death of Elvis Presley', Dee said that Elvis had become involved in an 
incestuous affair with his mother Gladys, who died in 1958.

She repeated this on national television and said she was told this by the family’s long-serving maid and Elvis's grandmother Minnie.

And if the claim that Elvis Presley, the biggest star rock and roll has ever known, slept with his mother wasn't enough, Dee's book made the allegation that he had an affair with Nick Adams, an Oscar nominated actor and star of ABC's iconic series 'The Rebel', who died of a prescription drug overdose in 1968.

However, many believed Dee's claims were motivated by petty jealously and vengeance aimed at Elvis for ruining her marriage to Vernon, which ended in November 1977, three months after Elvis's untimely death and 18 months before Vernon himself passed away.

In an interview published in the Lakeland Ledger in 1980 she said: 'Vernon was more married to Elvis than to me. He is ultimately what caused the deterioration of my marriage. He was incredibly selfish... like a black hole that totally sucks in everything around it.'

Looking the total opposite of dark haired and dark eyed Gladys Presley, Dee, who died on September 28th, first saw Elvis as he played a show in Newport News, Virginia, in 1955.

It was the year before he rocketed into celebrity orbit with hits such as Heartbreak Hotel, Blue Suede Shoes and Hound Dog.

However it was another three years later in Friedberg, Germany, where they first met as Elvis was serving with Dee's then husband, Sgt. William Stanley, in the U.S. Army.

Elvis's father had joined his son in Germany after the death in August 1958 of Gladys - which many say the King never truly got over or recovered from.

Dee set up a coffee date with the two to express her condolences, but when she arrived she discovered that Elvis had failed to show and left his father to meet the pretty blonde according to the Daily Mirror of the United Kingdom.

Indeed, it has been speculated that Dee in fact had set her sights onto Elvis, but he apparently at age 24 was not interested in a 29-year-old woman,

However, to Elvis's horror a romance blossomed between 52-year-old Vernon and Dee and in April 1960 Dee divorced her husband and settled down with Presley.

This caused Elvis to fly into a rage at the thought that his father could even contemplate marrying again so soon after the death of his mother.

Long recognized as the most important woman in Elvis's life, outstripping the impact of Priscilla whom he famously dedicated his hit 'You Were Always on My Mind' to, Gladys' death devastated the singer.

In fact, next to his grave at Graceland is where Gladys is also buried, a site of pilgramage for the millions who descend on the Memphis mansion every year.

Doting on his mother, Elvis bought Gladys a pink Cadillac when he became a global sensation, but she was prone to depression and her worries caused her to turn to drink.

Her excessive consumption of alcohol led her to develop liver damage and ultimately the hepatitis that killed her.

Elvis was away with the Army when she passed away and when he returned home his aunt Lilian described the harrowing scene as he closed the door to where her body was lying and began to cry out loud.

'She’s all we lived for, she was always my best girl,' said Elvis according to the Daily Mirror.

At her funeral the King threw himself over her body, screaming for her to come back to him and as she lay in the coffin he touchingly brushed her hair with his hands.

'He couldn’t stop touching her, kissing her, and whispering to her... ‘Just look at Mama, look at those hands of God, those hands toiled to raise me’. He carried around her nightgown, clutching it tightly even when he slept.'

Those family members who knew Elvis well said that after her death, 'He never seemed like Elvis again.'

Once he returned from the Army to begin his questionable film career, Elvis's relationship with Dee was best described as chilly.

However, he did eventually offer her three sons jobs in his entourage known as the 'Memphis Mafia' and bought her and his father a home on Dolan Drive in an upmarket area of Memphis.

These three boys became so engrained and trusted by Elvis that they became known as his 'TCBs' - 'Taking Care of Business.'

However, no doubt the Memphis Mafia was tight, but according to other friends the group could possibly share some of the blame for Elvis's descent in drugs as they could never say no to him.

One of Dee's sons, David Stanley, wrote after Elvis's death, 'I have never seen a human being in my life abuse drugs like Elvis.

'I am not talking about street drugs, I am talking about prescribed drugs. Some of the doctors were out for the almighty buck.'

Some have claimed that one of the reasons for Dee's animosity towards Elvis later in her life was because he welcomed everyone of her family into his - apart from her.

Her 1980 book, 'Elvis: We Love You Tender', is described as 'The story of a wife and mother, her sons and how it felt to have the major portion of our lives consumed by Elvis's own life.'

After his death she seemed to blame Elvis for her own sons descent into drug use.

'Elvis was a drug addict and none of us could admit it until after he was gone,' she said.

'There wasn’t a person in the world that would say no to him. If there was a woman or man strong enough, Elvis would be alive today.'

'His stepbrothers worshiped him and anything Elvis did, they did,' she said.

But did Elvis feel some remorse? Dee believes so.

She described him crying to her sons once and asking, 'Poor little Dee, poor little Dee, what have I done?'

But Dee claimed she always loved Elvis.

'I couldn't hate him for causing me tragedy,' she said to the Lakeland Ledger.

'For taking my husband and my sons away....Elvis was really just as victimized as we were.'

Defending her right to pen her own account of her time with Elvis, she justified it as taking back what had been lost to her.

'How could I exploit it any more than it has already been exploited? And besides, we all gave our lives to Elvis. Now maybe we’re just trying to take a little something back.'
