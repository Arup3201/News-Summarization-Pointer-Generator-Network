A teenager unable to hug his family for years for fear of the excruciating pain that came with being touched, has made a 'miracle' breakthrough.

Sam Ford, 14, would writhe in agony at an embrace with friends or family members, having been diagnosed with regional chronic pain syndrome (RCPS) two years ago.

The condition caused Sam to suffer persistent burning pain in his limbs forcing him to leave school and study at home.

But today the teenager from Shotley, near Ipswich in Suffolk is today back in the classroom for the first time in two years, thanks to a life-changing three-day course of treatment teaching him to retrain his brain.

Sam has battled the debilitating condition as well as ME, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome, and extreme hypermobility syndrome - both diagnosed when he was a child.

Countless NHS treatments and physiotherapy proved ineffective against Sam's RCPS.

But a specialist team at the Rowan Centre in Leiston, Suffolk, offered the teenager a free three-day programme after his plight came to light in January.

Sam's mother Emma Ford, 38, said 
since her son underwent the treatment he was 'got his life back', 
returning to school and finally able to enjoy hugs with his family.

The 38-year-old said: 'It's like I've got my son back again. It is nothing short of a miracle.

'To be rid of the pain he felt every day after just a three-day course is absolutely amazing.

'We walked the dog the other day which is something we have not done for at least 18 months and he asked "can I go for a run?"

'I said "of course you can" with a big lump in my throat,' said Ms Ford.

'He came back and said "something has really changed. I don't feel like I have just run a marathon".'

The mother-of-four said Sam has been 
for his first bike ride in two years and car journeys are no longer a 
traumatic endurance test.

His mother Emma, said: ''It's like I've got my son back again. It is nothing short of a miracle'

Since his treatment, Sam has stopped taking daily painkillers and medication.

Ms Ford said: 'I can now hug him - he can now hold his sisters' hands,' she added. 'I did not want another 14 years of fighting the illnesses.

'Our huge thanks goes to The Rowan Centre. Sam will always have ME but he now has the tools to manage it.

'It is just nice to see Sam confident again. He is growing in to the man he was always meant to be.'

Steve Fawdry, a co-founder of The 
Rowan Centre, explained the process behind the BodyMind philosophy which
 has put Sam on the road to recovery as he now gears up to take it one 
stage further.

Mr Fawdry said: 'Sam has completed phase one: preparation and is about to embark on phase two: education and training.

'He will learn about the 
brain-body connection, the physiology of stress, how the chronic stress 
response becomes established and how it impacts on various body systems.

'Stress hormones have a detrimental effect on the regulation of pain messages from the periphery to the brain.

'They can also impact on the patient's natural ability to release endorphins that sooth pain.

'This
 creates a chaotic, vicious cycle. To create a healing cycle, Sam will 
learn strategies and techniques to use on a moment-by-moment basis.'

He
 added: 'This will enable his brain and body to switch off the stress 
response and allow the proper regulation of pain messages and 
endorphins.

'Sam will effectively retrain his brain and body back into healing and recovery that becomeÂ  established over time.'

Sam said he is now looking forward to just living a 'normal life' with his family and friends.

He said: 'Everyone at school was really pleased to see me back. I just want to live life and be happy.'

Complex regional pain syndrome is a rare and poorly understood 
condition, in which a person develops a persistent burning pain in one 
of their limbs.

The pain usually develops after an injury but the pain experienced is out of all proportion to what you would expect.

For example a sufferer may only strain their ankle but it can feel like a serious burn.

The
 skin of the affected body part can become very sensitive and even the 
slightest touch, bump or change in temperature can provoke a feeling of 
intense pain.

In some cases the pain passes after a few weeks.

But others suffer the condition for months, and as in Sam's case, years.

There are three treatment options available.

- Physical therapy, including physiotherapy to help improve a sufferer's range of movement

- Medication, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like Ibuprofen to relieve pain

- Counselling and support to help people cope better emotionally with the impact of living with chronic pain
