The IRA staged an audacious attempt to assassinate Prince Philip in Australia during an official trip, a former spy has claimed.

The Irish paramilitary group allegedly planted two bombs targeting the Duke of Edinburgh’s cortege as he travelled through Sydney in 1973.

Both devices were located minutes before the royal visitor was due to pass, prompting an immediate security operation to allay the threat.

Targeted: The Duke of Edinburgh pictured in November 1973 a few months after the IRA allegedly plotted to kill him with two bombs while he was on a state visit to Australia

Scene: One of the devices was found in a bin and another was located in a locker at Central Station (above), the largest station in Australia, which Prince Philip planned to visit

The plot unfolded when the Duke was on a two-day visit to Australia and the terrorist organisation was escalating its campaign of violence against Britain.

One of the devices was found in a bin and another was located in a locker at Central Station, the largest station in Australia, which Prince Philip planned to visit.

Members of the Royal Family were regarded as key targets for the IRA, who subsequently murdered the Queen’s cousin, Lord Louis Mountbatten, blowing up his boat off the Irish coast in 1979.

Details of the assassination attempt have been revealed in a book by Australian journalist and former spy, Warner Russell.

He claims that two further ‘decoy’ devices were also discovered opposite a government building that Prince Philip was due to open. There has been no official confirmation of his claims.

Prince Philip - then aged 51 - was in the country to open an RAF memorial in Canberra.

Gratitude: Warner Russell, who alerted security to the plot, said he was later thanked for his 'sense of duty and service' by the Queen at a reception in Sydney years after the alleged attack

Mr Russell, 75, who was then working on the news desk of a newspaper, claims to have received a phone call 24 hours previously warning of the impending attack.

According to the ex-spy, the anonymous caller said: ‘We are going to get that Greek b*****d, the Duke. He is a dead man.’

After informing an intelligence contact about the call, he was informed the threat was ‘credible’ and probably involved the IRA.

Mr Russell also claims that the Australian government ordered a so-called ‘D-notice’ on the media, to prevent the plot being revealed to the public, although a short story later appeared in the New York Times detailing the discovery of the bombs.

Recalling the day of the visit on March 15, 1973, Mr Russell said: ‘The Royal Protection team ordered the approaching vehicles and the police motorcycle escort by radio to take evasive action.

‘The crudely made explosives were secured by an army bomb disposal team and later taken to a Commonwealth forensic laboratory for examination.’

Mr Russell said he was later thanked for his ‘sense of duty and service’ by the Queen at a reception in Sydney years after the alleged attack.
