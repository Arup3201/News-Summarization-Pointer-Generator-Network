Victor Valdes is unlikely to figure in Manchester United's squad to face Arsenal on Saturday despite David de Gea dislocating a finger.

Valdes, 32, has been training with United as he continues his rehabilitation from the posterior cruciate knee injury he suffered in March while at Barcelona, and Louis van Gaal could sign the goalkeeper if he proves his fitness after eight months on the sidelines.

However, despite being satisfied with his progress so far, Valdes is still considered short of the fitness level required to be tested in a Premier League game.

De Gea, who is United's only ever-present this season, suffered a dislocated finger when training with Spain last week and is a doubt for the Premier League clash at the Emirates which means Anders Lindegaard, who has not played for United since April, is expected to step up and deputise.

It was originally suggested that United's No 1 De Gea was going to be out for four weeks, however Sportsmail understands he could be back before then.

Valdes tweeted last week that he is 'almost ready' to return but medical staff believe he still has work to do before United consider registering him to play. 

Valdes is a free agent so can sign any time although they would have to apply for permission to include the player in their Premier League squad should they want to play him before January. United only named 24 senior players in their squad so have room to bring in Valdes.

United are due to play a behind-closed-doors friendly with Blackpool on Tuesday with Van Gaal contemplating run-outs for some of his returning squad.

Radamel Falcao is continuing to press for a recall this weekend after shaking off a calf injury.
