A 21-year-old woman is in a critical condition after being buried by an avalanche in Utah for 40 minutes.

The incident occurred about 5:30pm Saturday near the Tibble Fork Reservoir in American Fork County.

Ashleigh Nicole Cox - a 21-year-old Brigham Young University student from Colorado Springs, Colorado - was snowshoeing with a group of friends when she became caught in the avalanche.

The slide carried Cox into a stream where she was held underwater and covered in snow.

Officials said Cox was buried for roughly 20 minutes before rescue crews arrived and it took another 20 minutes to retrieve her from the snow, according to The Deseret News.
