A Lithuanian burglar who was released from prison early and deported has been caught back in Britain just 12 days later.

Police believe Marius Siurkus, 32, may have hoped to retrieve stolen jewellery he hid under floorboards.

He was arrested at his former address in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, last week after being identified as a suspect in an assault. 

Shocked and fearful: Alexandra Kalandrani, left, was robbed by Marius Siurkus, right, who served hardly any of his prison term before being sent back to Lithuania - only to return days later

Police noticed the floorboards had been disturbed and discovered loot from the burglary last March beneath them.

Incredibly, Siurkus’s accomplice in the burglary, countryman Mantas Pronckus, has twice been freed from prison early and deported – only to return to the UK and continue offending.

Yesterday the men’s victims and a local MP expressed their astonishment at the ease with which they came back.

Their most recent victim, dancer Alexandra Kalandrani, 26, said: ‘It’s massively frustrating to learn that both people who burgled my house have been let out early and sent home, only to come straight back to Britain.

‘I don’t understand how someone can walk back into the country so easily despite being deported.’

The jewellery found by police has been returned to Miss Kalandrani. It was a gift from her mother, who died from cancer in June. More items are still missing.

Stewart Jackson, the Tory MP for Peterborough, said: ‘It is quite clear that the current system is not working . . . Clearly it is good for the taxpayer if criminals are deported instead of serving in prison, but there needs to be a watch list of people who cannot come back.’ 

Accomplice: Mantas Pronckus was also jailed for the raid on Miss Kalandrani's home

Siurkus and Pronckus, 27, were jailed for a year and two years respectively in June for breaking in to the home Miss Kalandrani shares with her sister Rena, 24, a shop assistant manager.

Siurkus was deported on August 3, less than six weeks into his sentence, under an early removal scheme intended to cut costs and free up space in prisons. He was arrested again on August 15.

Siurkus has now been recalled to prison to serve out his sentence. He was not charged in connection with the assault investigation.

Pronckus was originally jailed for 20 months in May 2012 after being convicted of two burglaries.

He was arrested over another burglary the next April, and in August 2013 was sentenced to eight months in jail for that offence.

He was again released early and deported – only to target the Kalandranis’ home seven months later.

He remains in prison and will be considered for deportation.

In a letter to Mr Jackson, James Brokenshire, the immigration and security minister, said the early removal scheme means foreigners can be released up to 270 days before the halfway point of their sentence. They should not return until the sentence has expired.

He said: ‘I have asked Border Force to investigate how he has managed to return to the UK before his sentence expiry date.’

Shahadot Ahmed, 24, who was burgled by Pronckus in 2012, said: ‘It worries me that the system allows these people to go free.’

A Home Office spokesman said it has deported more than 19,000 foreign criminals since 2010. The spokesman said this was ‘saving the taxpayer money, freeing up prisons and removing the opportunity for re-offending’.  

Sentimental: This solid silver necklace, which Miss Kalandrani's late mother gave to her, was among the loot stolen by Sirukus and Pronckus. Thankfully police were able to recover this item and return it - but not everything was found
