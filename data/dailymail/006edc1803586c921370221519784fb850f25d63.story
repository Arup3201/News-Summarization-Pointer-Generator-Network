A Virginia teenager says she was forced to leave her prom after fathers who were acting as chaperones at the event complained that she was dancing provocatively and her skirt was too short.

Despite following the dress code on skirt length, and trying to reason with the organizers, the student says she was ordered to leave the dance.

The 17-year-old, identified only as 
Clare, is demanding a refund for her and her friends, who walked out of the prom with her in a show of unity.

Ruined: Virginia teenager Clare had been excited about her prom but organizers asked her to leave because of her dress

The teenager had been excited about the $25-a-ticket Twilight in Paris prom, which offered a welcome break as she studied for her finals.

After trawling round clothes stores she found the perfect outfit - a sparkly silver dress that met the regulation length of being longer than the fingertips when her arms were by her side.

'We waited eagerly for 
Saturday to arrive. My dress was gorgeous, silver, and sparkly and I got
 it at Macy’s and was very excited to find it after searching over six 
stores for this dress,' she said, adding that she had saved over several
 weeks to buy her outfit.

But, as soon as she walking into the venue last weekend, one of the organizers stopped her at the door and said: 'Honey, that dress is too short,' she claimed.

In a post she wrote on her sister's Wine and Marble blog about the incident, Clare said she showed the organizer that the dress did meet the regulation and she was let in.

'When I got into the ballroom I laughed, because I was surrounded by girls in much shorter dresses then me.' Clare said.

A short while later, as the teenager chatted to her friends and prom date while swaying to the music, she said she noticed a group of fathers staring at her from a balcony.

'We were also a little grossed out by all the dads on the balcony above the dance floor, ogling and talking amongst themselves,' she said.

It was at that point that one of the organizers approached Clare again and asked to speak to her in private.

'[She] told me that some of the dads who were chaperoning had complained that my dancing was too provocative, and that I was going to cause the young men at the prom to think impure thoughts,' Clare claimed.

The teenager said that despite trying to tell the woman that she and her friends hadn't even been dancing, she was told again that her dress was too short and she would have to leave.

Her concerned friends tried to intervene in the conversation, and say they hadn't even been dancing, but they were told the situation 'was none of their business'.

Clare's date also tried to explain that because the group had arrived together, if she was made to leave they would all have to go.

When the friends asked if they would be refunded for a dance they had spent less than half an hour at, they were told only Clare would be given a refund.

As she was being escorted, crying, from the venue, Clare says she asked the security guard what he made of the situation.

'I asked the security guy if my dress was compliant with the dress code and if he had noticed any inappropriateness in my behavior and he said he didn’t think I did anything to get kicked out but it wasn’t his call,' Clare wrote.

'We walked out of the prom, frustrated and angry and feeling very disrespected and violated,' Clare said, admitting that in a moment of immaturity they had shouted profanities.

Clare added that she felt singled out for her appearance, and is demanding that the Richmond Homeschool Prom organizers refund her friends who were forced to leave alongside her.

'I was told that the way I dressed and moved my body was causing men to think inappropriately about me, implying that it is my responsibility to control other people’s thoughts and drives,' she said.

'My group of five people had to leave the prom because I stuck out, I have long legs and I was wearing a sparkly dress, I didn’t look like most of the 13-15 year old girls there.'

The experience has left the teenager feeling frustrated and angry at being singled out for her appearance.

'I was talked to disrespectfully, ganged up on and treated as less then a person by people in authority, and when I requested to have one of my peers present to validate later what was said in this "meeting" I was denied that right,' she said.

'I felt violated by the sheer number of male parents that were assigned to do nothing for five hours other then watch girls in short dresses and heels dance to upbeat music,' Clare added.

'I think that it is sick and wrong that they assigned them to sit on a balcony above us and look down on us and single us out for our clothes or dancing.'

Friends of the teenager told her later that as the evening went on, other students were dancing proactively, yet no one intervened to stop them.

'I’m only 17, but I can see there’s something wrong about this ... please tell me I’m not the only one who think it doesn’t matter how people are dressed or how they move their bodies, we should still treat them with respect and decency.'

The teenager said she wants answers from the organizers about the way she feels she was treated.

'[Is] Richmond Homeschool Prom adult enough to own up to their wrong actions as well. And refund my group as they verbally promised to do, and issue an apology for kicking me out of my senior prom because their husbands felt as though my body was something they had a right to control,' she said.

Organizers for the Richmond Homeschool Prom have not yet responded to a Mail Online request for comment.

Clare is currently getting ready to sit her final examinations, but her sister Hannah said she was overwhelmed by the messages of support and the reaction to her experiences.

The family also denied that racism had been a factor in Clare and her boyfriend being asked to leave.

'I
 don’t feel race played a part in all that happened Saturday night,' 
Clare's boyfriend said. 'I strongly believe they did not know we were 
together until the situation had already escalated.'

He is the only one in the group of friends to have been issued a refund.
