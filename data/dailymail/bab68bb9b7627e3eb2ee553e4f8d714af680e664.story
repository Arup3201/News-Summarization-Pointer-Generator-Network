When Manchester City host Arsenal at the Etihad on Sunday, not only will two of the best teams in the Premier League be going head to head, but two of the league's brightest stars. 

Alexis Sanchez and Sergio Aguero have been the focal points for their sides, plundering 26 league goals between them. 

The two would be almost certain to make up any composite Premier League XI, but if you could only have one, who would you choose? Sportsmail's reporters reveal which of the South American duo they would pick?

Martin Keown - Aguero

It’s a close call because they are both top-quality players who have the ability to absolutely embarrass defenders with their pace and skill. But I think I’d take Aguero over Sanchez. He is in the top three strikers we have ever seen in the Premier League and has been performing at incredible levels of consistency since he first arrived. It’s still early days for Sanchez, but he has certainly made a stunning start to his career at Arsenal. 

Neil Ashton - Aguero

His hat-trick against Bayern Munich in the Champions League at the Etihad was something special. He also kept his cool with the last chance of the game against QPR to win the title for Manchester City. Sanchez has been brilliant for Arsenal but Aguero is ruthless in front of goal.  

Rob Draper - Sanchez

This is almost impossible! In terms of ability, goal-scoring, finishing and technique it’s hard to split them. But if you insist I’ll go for Sanchez because he’s injured less and because of the energy he gives to them team. Like Luis Suarez, he galvanises the entire team with his pressing. It’s not that Aguero doesn’t do his fair share but Sanchez is exceptional. And when you see your star player working that hard, it means every other player has to follow the example. 

Chris Wheeler - Sanchez 

On current form, it would have to be Sanchez – not least because he can stay fit. Aguero is the better finisher but he missed a large portion of last season with muscle injuries and only returned to action for Manchester City last weekend after another seven-game absence. Sanchez has set the Premier League alight for Arsenal and also offers more in terms of where he can play across the front and work-rate.

Laurie Whitwell - Aguero

Very close call but the City striker edges it for me due to his frightening ability to score whatever the circumstances. No matter how tight an angle or implausible a path to goal, he finds a way. Electric speed and mercurial movement over a sustained period. Although a fearsome forward, Sanchez has found himself shut out on a few occasions when Aguero would have netted. 

Phil Duncan - Sanchez 

Aguero’s goal record is unrivalled. If he carries on like this, he’ll be remembered as one of the all-time Premier League greats. But if I had to choose between City’s sharp-shooter and  Sanchez, I’d pick the Arsenal man all day and every day.

Sanchez scores but he offers so much more than that. He makes goals, too, his workload is astonishing and he isn’t afraid to get hurt. No wonder he’s quickly emerged as a favourite on the terraces and the first name on Arsene Wenger’s teamsheet. 

Sam Cunningham - Aguero

When Aguero is fit and firing he is virtually unstoppable. At the start of the season before his injury in December, the Manchester City striker was beginning to be talked about in the same breath as Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Aguero can't quite find the consistency of fitness to propel him into the upper echelons. While Sanchez is a phenomenal player, he is distinctly a level below Aguero at 100 per cent.

Sami Mokbel - Sanchez 

It's close, because they are two brilliant footballers. But the Arsenal star is more of an all-rounder. Aguero's game is about scoring goals - Sanchez does that and more. So Sanchez - but only just. 

Matt Lawless - Aguero

I love Sanchez's never-say-die attitude. His work-rate is phenomenal and he has been the glue to hold Arsenal together this season. He is pure class. But I'd still have Aguero over him in my team. His movement is second to none, his feet are lightning fast and his finishing speaks for itself. Quality personified. Can't I just say both though? No, OK... Aguero it is then. Just.

Mike Keegan - Aguero 

City's talisman has the best strike-rate in Premier League history among anyone who has played 100 games. He is not just the best attacker in England, he is one of the best in the world and already has two titles under his belt. Would Barcelona have sold him? I don't think so.

Mike Anstead - Aguero

Sanchez has been a revelation since arriving at Arsenal but Aguero edges it for me for his ability to find a goal from nowhere. When he's fit and on it, there's no better striker in the Premier League. 

Craig Hope - Sanchez 

Aguero is the better player, yes, but Sanchez does it every week - he's never injured and has contributed to more than half of Arsenal's goals by scoring or setting them up. With Aguero, you never know when he's next set for a spell on the sidelines.

TOTAL: AGUERO 7 SANCHEZ 5
