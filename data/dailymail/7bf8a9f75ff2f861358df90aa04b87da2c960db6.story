Justice Secretary Chris Grayling vowed to take action after a group of Iraqis were accused of conspiring to claim  soldiers had executed prisoners

Lawyers who accuse British troops of abuse in warzones will no longer be able to get millions of pounds in legal aid for their clients, the Justice Secretary said yesterday.

Chris Grayling vowed to take action after a group of Iraqis were accused of conspiring to claim  soldiers had executed prisoners.

Lawyers embroiled in the case have received a total of £10million in legal aid, MPs heard yesterday.

Mr Grayling said that – if it was found claims against the Army had been lodged on a 'false basis' – he would seek to recover some of the money.

The Al Sweady Inquiry is examining claims that troops executed 20 or more prisoners and  tortured nine others at a camp near Basra in May 2004.

But after a year-long hearing costing taxpayers £27million, the case fell apart when lawyers for the Iraqis admitted there was no evidence that insurgents were murdered.

The inquiry also heard that evidence linking the men to a 'terrorist organisation' in Iraq had been suppressed by lawyers.

It is claimed they would never have got legal aid to fight the case if the full facts had been known. They are being represented by Phil Shiner's Public Interest Lawyers and Leigh Day. The Iraqis have no residency rights in Britain and live overseas.

In the Commons, Tory MP David Mowat said: 'Two firms of lawyers that specialise in suing active servicemen, Public Interest Lawyers and Leigh Day, have received £10million in legal aid in the last three years, and the MoD has subsequently spent many more millions on defending those cases.

'No other country in the world would pay lawyers to sue its own army. When we will stop doing so?'

Mr Grayling replied that he was introducing a residence test that would mean 'such cases were no longer possible'.

This will work by banning foreign nationals from receiving legal aid for civil claims until they have lived here for at least a year.

Phil Shiner of Public Interest Lawyers outlines his case against the Ministry of Defence as he stands outside the High Court in central London last year. Shiner was representing a number of Iraqi civilians who claim to have been abused and tortured and seen family members killed by members of the British military

Lawyers Leigh Day & Co claim that the four representative lead cases were victims of grave acts of torture - including castration and severe sexual assault - by British officials in camps during the Mau Mau Uprising between 1952 and 1961

There are currently no nationality or 
residence restrictions on civil legal aid. The Justice Secretary said: 
'I think it important for there to be restraints on our legal aid 
system.'

Mr Grayling added: 
'If the taxpayer has ended up paying a large amount of money for a case 
brought on a false premise, I will want to take the strongest possible 
action, including looking at taking financial measures against the firms
 involved.'

The Al Sweady inquiry was named after one of those who died in 2004.

The
 Iraqis alleged troops from the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders took 
bloody revenge for the massacre of six Royal Military policemen a year 
earlier. The MoD insisted the men were insurgents killed in battle.

A spokesman for Leigh Day defended the firm's work, saying the figures quoted are 'nonsense'.

He said: 'We are proud to be a legal aid firm representing people from around this country and beyond when they come up against injustice of many sorts, acting for the vulnerable in cases of clinical negligence, disability discrimination and abuse cases.

'Within that we have acted for injured service personnel as well as injured civilians against the MoD primarily on a no win no fee basis but also occasionally with the benefit of legal aid.  

'Legal aid remains essential for the access to justice it provides to all individuals to ensure that not only this Government, but also future Governments, can be held accountable by individuals for their actions, whether here or overseas.

'The sums quoted by Mr Mowat are nonsense. They clearly include all the legal aid work the firm does in providing for individuals to protect their rights and compensate them for injuries against Government and large corporations.

'Any legal aid we have received in terms of claims against the MoD are totally marginal. We received no legal aid for the Al Sweady inquiry.'
