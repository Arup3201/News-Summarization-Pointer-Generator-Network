The housing market is starting to cool as sky-high prices and tough new mortgage rules curb demand, experts say today.

The number of house hunters contacting estate agents for the first time rose again last month but at the slowest pace since February 2013, according to the report.

Inquiries from new buyers in London – where fears the market is overheating are particularly high – fell for the first time since January last year.

The report, by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, suggests potential buyers are becoming more cautious in the face of soaring prices and lending restrictions.

Estate agents now expect prices in London to rise by an average of just under 5 per cent a year for the next five years – down from the 9 per cent they were projecting as recently as March.

That would bring the pace of price increases in line with the national average and ease pressure on the Bank of England to step in to stop the market spiralling out of control.

Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at RICS, said the market ‘remains relatively robust’ around the country.

But he added: ‘What we are really seeing is some of the very strong upward momentum starting to come off the housing market, as a lack of supply, higher prices, more prudent lending measures and some of the talk from the Bank of England are creating a level of caution among sellers and buyers.’

The RICS report says tough new lending rules introduced in the Mortgage Market Review in April are helping to take the heat out of the market.

Banks are ‘lending less’, the report claims, with the average loan-to-value ratio among first-time buyers edging down from 86 per cent in April to 85.3 per cent in May.

Under the new rules, mortgage applicants have to pass through more detailed checks about their regular outgoings to make sure they can afford their payments even when interest rates rise.

A shortage of properties coming onto the market are also putting off buyers, the report claims.

Surveyors now expect UK house prices to increase by 3.6 per cent over the next 12 months – the lowest figure since December.

A senior Bank official yesterday warned that an overheating housing market is the biggest threat to the British economy as it bounces back from the recession.

Ben Broadbent, who takes over as deputy governor next month, told MPs that the recovery in property prices could lead to an increase in risky mortgage lending.

He said that would pose risks to financial stability if ‘left unchecked’ but added that the Bank’s Financial Policy Committee – set up to prevent another crisis – stands ready to intervene.

‘Domestically, the main potential threat lies in the housing market,’ said Mr Broadbent, who joined the central bank from Goldman Sachs three years ago. ‘I say potential because, as yet, growth in mortgage debt remains low.’

But he added: ‘The housing market is recovering. That poses a risk to financial stability if it is accompanied by sharp rises in the number of risky mortgages.

‘If the strength of the housing market threatens to increase credit growth to unsustainable levels it is clear that the FPC would have reason to intervene.’

Figures from mortgage lender Halifax last week showed the price of an average home rose by £223 a day in May in the biggest increase since records began more than 30 years ago.

A separate report from the Office for National Statistics showed prices in London are nearly 25 per cent higher than their pre-recession peak.

The figures piled pressure on the Bank to act to cool the housing market, particularly in the capital, where there are growing fears of a bubble.

The housing market is expected to be high on the agenda when the FPC meets next week.

Senior Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, said the meeting ‘will be an important opportunity’ for the Bank to evaluate the risks stemming from housing.
