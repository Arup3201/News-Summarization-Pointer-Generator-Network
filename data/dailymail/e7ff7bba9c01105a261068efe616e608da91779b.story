Former Tory treasurer Lord Jonathan Marland has emerged as a strong contender for the vacant Premier League chairmanship.

Marland had discussions about the role before corporate financier Anthony Fry, who has stood down for health reasons, was appointed in April 2013. But Marland then had too many other business and political commitments, including being the Prime Minister’s trade envoy.

These have now eased, leaving the Tory peer able to devote the number of days required for such a crucial football role. And Marland has both the stature and character to gain the respect of the 20 clubs in the top flight.

Next in line? Lord Jonathan Marland is in the running to take the Premier League chairmanship

Marland made a late challenge to Giles Clarke in 2009 for the chairmanship of the England and Wales Cricket Board but withdrew before the vote, not having had enough time to win support around the counties. He had been particularly scornful of the ECB’s handling of the rift between Kevin Pietersen and Peter Moores.

The PL panel, led by Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck, tasked with finding Fry’s successor are waiting until chief executive Richard Scudamore shows he’s fully fit to resume duties after major heart surgery before selecting a second chairman in two years.

Former Southampton chairman Rupert Lowe is another name being linked with the PL chairmanship.

Saints alive! Former Southampton chairman Rupert Lowe (C) has also been linked with the position

Even Geoffrey Boycott is now on Twitter, although its immediate response capability is rather lost for Boycs as he dictates his tweets for his more techno-savvy daughter Emma to post.

The word at the Old Trafford Test was that Giles Clarke will stand down as chairman of the ECB, with Yorkshire’s Colin Graves his most likely successor.

However, the Clarke camp insists he wants to carry on, even after the county-influenced departure of close ally, ECB chief executive David Collier. Graves says he hasn’t thought about the chairmanship, and he may not want to leave Yorkshire having invested so much time and money into the county.

The FA intend to prioritise certain international tournaments in future so PL clubs know well in advance when players are needed. The PL are for once supportive of an FA policy. The clubs say the problem in the past has been the lack of information from the FA as to when players will be called up.

THIN SKINNED ALLOTT 

Paul Allott, mediocre presenter of Sky Sports’ Cricket Writers on TV, is ill-suited to host a show about media comment on the sport judging by his furious reaction to one sentence of negative opinion about his Lancashire board role — which also conflicts with his Sky job. 

Thin skinned: Sky presenter Paul Allott took exception to a question about his role on the Lancashire board

Sports Agenda reported relegation-threatened Lancashire members’ concerns that director of cricket Mike Watkinson reports on cricket matters to his close friend Allott. So when he spotted your columnist in a Lancashire VIP area during the Old Trafford Test, he demanded that security were called to remove me in such an exaggeratedly aggressive manner that even his son told him to calm down. 

Allott refused to accept that I had been invited into the hospitality area by one of his fellow board members until confirmed personally.

Later, at an Old Trafford reception for the media, when Sports Agenda attempted to defuse the situation by asking for a quiet word with Allott, Lancashire’s equally preposterous chairman Michael Cairns said that couldn’t happen as the club lawyer wasn’t present.

If Allott hadn’t been so busy enjoying himself in the Old Trafford hospitality boxes or trying to eject your columnist last Friday evening, he would have saved himself from an embarrassing altercation with fourth Test match referee Ranjan Madugalle the following morning.

Embarrassing: Allott's suggestion to bring in the boundaries was given short shrift by Ranjan Madugalle (L)

Allott, concerned that the drainage fiasco would continue to postpone play, went to see Madugalle to ask for the boundary ropes to be brought in. 

Allott was given short shrift as that option had been discounted the previous night — no changes can be made to the size of the playing area once the match has started.
