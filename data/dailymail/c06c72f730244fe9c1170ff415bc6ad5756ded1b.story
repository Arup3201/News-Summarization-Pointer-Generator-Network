Unimpressed: Former Metropolitan Police deputy assistant commissioner Stephen Kavanagh spoke out after becoming fed up of officers pulling sickies

Police officers are pulling sick days to nurse their hangovers in bed, a chief constable has claimed.

Stephen Kavanagh, 47, who leads Essex Police, spoke out after becoming fed up of officers drinking too much and then failing to show up.

The Chelmsford-based force’s officers average 12 days off sick every year - but married father-of-one Mr Kavanagh has now vowed to get tough on those abusing the system.

The £192,000-a-year chief constable said: ‘If you look at the overall numbers, compared to other forces, there is a group - a small group, but a group nonetheless - abusing the process.

‘If they can’t get time off, they take it sick. If they have a heavy night, on occasions they are taking days off. They will be challenged and, if necessary, they will be dealt with.

'I am concerned the current levels of sickness mean some officers have to pick up the work of those not in. If anyone abuses the sickness management process, then they will be challenged. What I want to do is have a sickness management process that supports those who are genuinely in need.’

Essex Police Federation chairman Mark Smith agreed sickness levels had got out of hand, but added: ‘Police officers are suffering - they are under pressure and more is being heaped on.

‘Managers don’t have time to follow sickness procedures and we are not on top of it. There is no welfare system and the stress is too much.’

Looking inside: Mr Kavanagh said that if for some officers, 'if they have a heavy night, on occasions they are taking days off' (file picture)

However Mr Kavanagh was quick to compare his team’s sickness record with that of nurses in a similarly stressful environment at nearby Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford.

He added: ‘We should be much better than where we are at the moment. Nurses at Broomfield Hospital have an average of seven days off a year, while my officers are off for more than 12.

‘Policing can be a stressful occupation, but so is being a nurse or a member of any other emergency service or the military.

‘I will be working with the federation to
see how we support those who are genuinely in need and how we work 
together to make sure people do not abuse the system.

Comparison: Mr Kavanagh said nurses at Broomfield Hospital (pictured) in Chelmsford have an average of seven days off a year, while his officers are off for more than 12

‘I think we all aspire to have one of the lowest sickness rates in the country.’

'If they can’t get time off, they take it sick. If they have a heavy night, on occasions they are taking days off. They will be challenged and, if necessary, they will be dealt with'

Stephen Kavanagh, Essex Police chief constable

Mr Kavanagh was born in Basildon, Essex, and joined the county’s force in May from a high profile role in the Metropolitan Police, where he started as a constable in 1985.

In 1998, the Cambridge University graduate took on the role of Homicide Senior Investigating Officer for East London, leading on 50 murder investigations.

He was deputy assistant commissioner in London and played leading roles in the wake of the 7/7 bombings, the phone hacking probe and the riots in 2011.

In the past he has also been in charge of protecting the Royal family and the Palaces of Westminster.
