Olivier Giroud is positive he can form a destructive strike partnership with new Arsenal signing Alexis Sanchez this season. 

Manager Arsene Wenger has talked up the Chilean player's ability to play through the middle as a loan striker as well as from the flanks. 

But £30 million man Sanchez started out wide in the 3-0 Community Shield thrashing of Manchester City, and Giroud made the most of his chance, firing in the third goal.

The French striker said: 'I have a good understanding with Alexis. It is always easy to play with this kind of player. 

'He will need some more games to adapt his game to the Premier League but he is a fantastic player so I think he will do a great season. 

'He has different qualities. He can bring pace and technique and he's a great finisher.'

Arsenal's title challenge last season faltered partly due to an over-reliance on Giroud. 

Wenger responded by snapping up 25-year-old World Cup star Sanchez from Barcelona and his new teammate is adamant Arsenal are ideally placed to win a first Premier League title since 2004.

The experienced manager has also signed Calum Chambers, Mathieu Debuchy and David Ospina while World Cup winners Per Mertesacker, Lukas Podolski and Mesut Ozil still to return from an extended break.

Giroud, who scored 22 goals last season in all competitions, said: 'We have a good quality squad and that is why I think we will be stronger than last year. 

'When our German World Cup players come back and join us we will be stronger and hopefully stay that way until May.

'Last year we did well until March and then had a bad run after.'

Giroud's long-range strike clinched victory at Wembley after first half goals from Santi Cazorla and Aaron Ramsey.

Arsenal get their Premier League bid underway on Saturday against Crystal Palace at the Emirate and last season's top scorer is raring to go. 

'I was feeling ok in the game and will be ready for the Crystal Palace match,' Giroud added. 

'It's always great for a striker to score.

'I was man of the match and I will take it with pleasure.'
