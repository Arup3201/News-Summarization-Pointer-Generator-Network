From public urination to streaking and night-time fistfights, Paul Ghysels has seen it all while living in a house sandwiched between two UC Berkeley fraternities.

Ghysels, 61, a Vietnam War veteran and retired Chicago firefighter, purchased more than $60,000 worth of surveillance equipment in hopes of warding off his neighbors’ bad behavior, but to no avail.

‘I have video of them throwing 1.75-liter glass bottles of vodka off their tower, at the front door of our house,’ he said.

Neighbors from hell: Paul Ghysels, 61, a retired firefighter and Vietnam vet, has been locked in a battle with several fraternities in Berkeley, which he says had turned his life into  his life a living nightmare

For years, Mr Ghysels has been fighting a war of attrition against inconsiderate college students living on the edge of Berkeley's infamous Frat Row.

Ghysels moved from Chicago to Berkeley in 1988 and settled in his wife's old family home on Durant Avenue that once belonged to her grandmother.

At first, the couple and their young neighbors got along fine.

'We were invited to the fraternities for their Monday night lobster and steak dinners, and I did many things for the fraternities,' the retired firefighter told ABC's 20/20 in an episode that airs tonight at 10pm. 

But with the advent of cell phones and social media, things quickly spiraled out of control in the neighborhood jam-packed with fraternities and sororities, which were now drawing hundreds of people to their parties every weekend.

Anyone familiar with the plot of the 2014 comedy Neighbors starring Seth Rogen and Zac Efron can guess what happened when, much like Rogen's character in the movie, Mr Ghysels started complaining about the loud noise and inappropriate conduct of rowdy college kids.

In a case of life imitating art, the fraternities declared war of Ghysels and his family.

According to the 61-year-old homeowner, students would break into his house, throw up and defecate on the edge of his property and even leave death threats on his voicemail.

Even local police could do nothing to stop the fraternities from throwing wild parties lasting into the wee hours of the morning.

'We’re under siege and we’re not getting really any help from the university or the authorities,’ Ghysels said.

Ghysels has been documenting his neighbors' antics with surveillance cameras installed all over his property.

His extensive collection includes videos of young men and women running naked down the street and relieving themselves in public, groups of drunken college kids brawling outside his house and liquor bottles flying over the fence.

At war: Like in the movie, things took a bad turn for Ghysels after he started complaining about the frat boys' behavior

In an interview with Inside Edition last year, Ghysels said the makers of Neighbors went on a site called ucberkeleyfrats.com, where he has been posting his surveillance videos, to get ideas for some of the debauchery scenes in the raunchy flick.

Ghysels’ attorney Yolanda Huang told ABC that the Berkeley Police Department receives on average 400 calls a year about frat houses, but no one is ever arrested.

The law enforcement agency released a statement to the news station saying that it takes 'all crimes seriously' and 'tries to address community concerns regarding noise complaints, loud parties and alcohol issues.'

Officials with UC Berkeley said they work with Greek organizations affiliated with the university on 'safety, wellness and risk management.'

If a fraternity is found to be in violation of university policies, it can be stripped of its affiliation to UC Berkeley.

Ghysels, however, insists that police and UC Berkeley are not doing enough to address the problem, which is why in 2010 he filed a lawsuit naming dozens of defendants, among them 34 fraternities.

The retiree's original suit was dismisses in 2014 but he appealed the decision and refiled the suit.

Ghysels and his wife, Kate, moved out of the house on Frat Row in 2010, but the former firefighter who is currently battling cancer hopes that one day his spouse will be able to return to her family home in the 2700 block of Durant Avenue.

‘I’m strong enough to continue this, and to keep it going until we have a resolution,’ he said. ‘My friends say that it’s probably because of this that I’m still alive.’
