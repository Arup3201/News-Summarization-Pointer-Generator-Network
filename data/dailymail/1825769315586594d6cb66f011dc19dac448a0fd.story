Rafael Nadal cracks a rare smile on a night out with his long-term girlfriend Xisca Perllo in Paris.

The Spaniard looked happy and relaxed as he headed out for a dinner during a day off from duties at the French Open on Sunday.

No doubt buoyed by the news his rival Roger Federer was booted out of the tournament by Ernests Gulbis, the 27-year-old was seen joking around with pretty Xisca after dinner at the city's posh L’Avenue restaurant.

Nadal, who is bidding for a record ninth French Open title, has breezed through the first week of the tournament without dropping a set.

He complained of back pain after his straight sets win over Leonardo Mayer on 
Saturday but showed no sign it was bothering him as he strolled around the streets of Paris.

Rafa faces a tricky test today in the form of Serbia’s No 2 Dusan Lajovic who has impressed in only his second Grand Slam tournament.

He has also yet to drop a set and surprised many by dispatching American Jack Sock with such ease in the third round.

His countryman Novak Djokovic has already been giving the 23-year-old advice on facing Nadal.

Djokovic said: 'Of course we talk. He is the same generation of my younger brother. I know he's very talented and he's showing his full potential right now.

'I'm really glad that Serbia has a new up-and-coming tennis star that obviously is performing now at his best on the Grand Slam level, which is great to see.'

Rafa could potentially face Wimbledon champion Andy Murray in the semi-finals later this week.
