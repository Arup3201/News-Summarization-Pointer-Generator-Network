Crowds gathered to watch the historic moment the world's last two airworthy Lancaster Bombers flew over Windermere today.

Spectators lined the shores of Windermere to see the momentous event of the two Second World War planes flying together.

The special flight was organised by Robert Johnstone as a surprise for his father, Archie, to celebrate what would have been the war veteran's 100th birthday.

Crowds watched the historic moment the world's last two airworthy Lancaster Bombers flew over Windermere, in Cumbria, today

The Lancaster Vera (pictured) has been joined by the Lancaster Thumper at various events over the past few weeks - marking the first time the two Bombers have flown together in 50 years

The fly-over is part of a tour that will culminate in a Battle of Britain Memorial Flight at RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire, on Sunday September 28

The Lancaster Vera - built two years after the raids, in 1945 - was acquired by Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum in 1978 and underwent a 10-year restoration

The special flight was organised by Robert Johnstone to commemorate his father, Archie, who was a navigator in 617 Squadron of the RAF, which has become known as the 'Dambusters' squadron

Archie, from Grange-over-Sands, was a navigator in 617 Squadron of the RAF, which has become known as the 'Dambusters' squadron, who took out the feared Tirpitz battleship in a daring raid over Norwegian fjords. 

His son, Robert, from Lancaster, had arranged a fly-past of his nursing home on his birthday today - but he passed away in April. 

As such, the flight was moved to Brockhole Visitor Centre - where Archie and Robert would often visit for days out - to commemorate the war hero. 

Elsewhere, there were 1940s-themed games and historical scenes from the front line. 

The fly-over is part of a tour that has seen the two aircraft appear in a series of air shows and events around the UK over the last few weeks. 

It has been sponsored by the Blackburn brewery, which brews the popular Lancaster Bomber ale.  

It will culminate in a Battle of Britain Memorial Flight at RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire, on Sunday September 28.

Over the past few weeks, the Lancaster Thumper, which is part of the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial flight, has joined the Canadian Lancaster Vera from a museum in Ontario.

Lancasters are perhaps best known for their use in the historic Dambusters raids of 1943, when the RAF’s 617 Squadron used ‘bouncing bombs’ to destroy dams that helped power German industrial plants in Ruhr.

19 Victoria Crosses won by men of Bomber Command, including Guy Gibson, who led the Dambusters raid.

125,000 Bomber Command air crew serving during World War Two.

55,573 Died in action, with a death rate of 44 per cent. 

9,838 Bomber crew became prisoners.

1.3m Tons of Allied bombs on Germany.

More than 7,377 Lancasters, 430 of which were built in Canada, were built during the Second World War but many that survived were scrapped.

It was the most successful bomber used by the Royal Air Force and the Royal Canadian Air Force.

In 1940, Prime Minister Winston Churchill threw his support behind the Royal Air Force's Fighter Command and the development of Bomber Command, stating: 'The Navy can lose us the war, but only the Air Force can win it. 

'Therefore our supreme effort must be to gain overwhelming mastery in the air.

'The Fighters are our salvation, but the Bombers alone provide the means of victory.'

The Lancaster Vera - built two years after the raids, in 1945 - was acquired by Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum in 1978 and underwent a 10-year restoration.

Vera - dedicated to Andrew Mynarski, the last Canadian airman to be awarded the VC in World War II – made the long journey to Britain from its base at the Ontario's Warplane Heritage Museum at the beginning of August. 

Honoured: Andrew Mynarski was the last Canadian airman to be awarded the Victoria Cross in the Second World War

'Probably the most famous Allied bomber of the Second World War, the Avro Lancaster had impressive flying characteristics and operational performance,' the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum says on its website. 

The plane is dedicated to the memory of Pilot Officer Andrew Mynarski who was awarded the Victoria Cross - the highest award for bravery in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Canadian Mynarski won the award on June 13, 1944, when his Lancaster was shot down in flames by a German night fighter during the Second World War.

As the bomber fell, Mynarski managed to free the tail gunner trapped in the rear turret of the blazing and out-of-control aircraft before he died.

The crew member survived and lived to tell the tale, resulting in the Victoria Cross being awarded in 1946 - the last such award to a Canadian airman in the Second World War.

The Lancaster bomber, which has flown in the UK the last few weeks, was dedicated to Mynarski, and is referred to as the 'Mynarski Memorial Lancaster'.

It is painted in the colours of his aircraft KB726 – VR-A, which flew with RCAF Squadron. 

In 1952, it suffered a serious accident and received a replacement wing centre section from a Lancaster that had flown in combat over Germany.

It served as a maritime patrol aircraft in Newfoundland for many years and was retired from the RCAF in late 1963.

With help from the Sulley Foundation in 1977, it was acquired from the Royal Canadian Legion in Goderich, Ontario, where it had been on outside display.

Eleven years passed before it was completely restored and flew again on September 24, 1988.
