Unions expect thousands of jobs to go as the Abbott government prepares to axe 175 government agencies.

The hit-list is in addition to the 76 announced in the May budget, and the total is estimated to save taxpayers more than $500 million over four years.

The government aims to cut duplication, streamline services and outsource to the private sector.

Reports of the savings measures come as Treasurer Joe Hockey prepares to release the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook on Monday, which economists say could reveal a deficit for 2014/15 upwards of $35 billion.

Community and Public Sector Union national secretary Nadine Flood said there had already been 8000 public service job losses this year and the proposed outsourcing would take a heavy toll.

'We could see anywhere between one (thousand) and in fact eight to nine thousand jobs go,' she told ABC TV.

'This seems to be an ideologically blinkered approach that says public bad, private better.'

Finance Minister Mathias Cormann confirmed there would be some impact on jobs and would not rule out forced redundancies.

'We inherited a bloated public service from our predecessors,' Senator Cormann told Sky News on Saturday.

'The goal is to ensure that the government is as big as it needs to be but as small as it can be.'

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten warned Australia's economy was in danger of stalling and now was not the time for mass sackings.

'The finance minister's talking gobbledegook ... it's a cliche masquerading as an economic policy,' he told reporters in Brisbane.

The national unemployment rate reached a 12-year high of 6.3 per cent in November. 

The Australian Government Solicitor is among agencies that will be dismantled.

Opposition legal affairs spokesman Mark Dreyfus said it was short-sighted to cut an agency that had been providing government legal services since federation.

'Any legal work that would have been undertaken by the AGS will simply be contracted out to private law firms for a much higher price,' he said. 

In his weekend YouTube message, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said a lot of good things happened in 2014, adding 'our policies are creating jobs, helping families and bringing the budget back under control.'

Shadow assistant treasurer Andrew Leigh said a similar slash-and-burn exercise in the early years of the Howard government backfired eventually.

'(They) lost a whole lot of corporate memory, but by the end of their time in office, the number of public servants per Australian was back where it had started,' he told Sky News.

Labor and the Greens are urging the government to use Monday's budget review to drop unpopular measures such as changes to university fees, GP co-payments and cuts to pensions.

But Prime Minister Tony Abbott is staying the course.

'Our policies are creating jobs, helping families and bringing the budget back under control,' he said in his weekend YouTube message.
