Cages designed to protect children from Mexican gray wolves at New Mexico's bus stops have come under fire for demonizing the endangered animals, which have never attacked anyone in the state.

Environmentalists argue the wooden and mesh cages erected in the town of Reserve a decade ago are only furthering the misunderstanding of the animals, their behaviors and the dangers they pose.

But supporters of the cages - including residents and conservative anti-government organizations - insist that the animals, which were reintroduced to the area in 1998, pose a very real threat.

The debate has resurfaced because the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposes to extend Endangered Species Act protections for around 75 wolves left in New Mexico and Arizona.

Necessary? Children stand in a wolf cage in Reserve, New Mexico. Environmentalists say the cages, designed to protect against the Mexican gray wolf, give the wrong impression about the animals

The FWS is also seeking to make it illegal to kill
wolves in most situations and would greatly expand the area
where wolves can exist without interference, FoxNews.com reported.

To many conservatives in the area, the proposals are simply examples of meddling government officials who do not know what it is like to live with wild wolves.

Ranchers are now battling the extension, claiming the animals should be hunted.

Anti-wolf campaigns are underway, portraying the animal as a savage beast that stalks and preys on children. The opinion has led to scores of illegal killings of the wolves over the past two decades.

Carolyn Nelson, a teacher in Catron County where the cages have been built, said even more needs to be done to protect the town's children.

Danger? The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is proposing to extend Endangered Species Act protections for 75 Mexican gray wolves in New Mexico and Arizona - but residents say they're a threat

The Mexican gray wolf, a subspecies of the gray wolf, is the world's most endangered wolf. They typically prey on elk and deer, but are also known to eat rabbits and squirrels.

After the species was wiped out in the U.S., they were bred in captivity and reintroduced to the wild in Arizona and New Mexico in 1998. There are now only around 75 in the states.

In the past four decades, there have been just three documented wolf attacks on humans in North America - and none of these were by the Mexican gray wolf. The attacks took place in Canada and Alaska, not the West.

Likewise, the incidence of wolves killing cattle and sheep is less common than believed. Around a third of sheep deaths across the country are due to predators and just 0.4 per cent of those attacks are by wolves, according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service. Interestingly, domestic dogs are responsible for almost 20 times more sheep deaths.

In cattle deaths, wolves kill fewer cows than coyotes, domestic dogs, cougars and vultures.

Nevertheless, residents of New Mexico towns such as Reserve - where the cages are found - say the animals have stalked and cornered their children, spreading fear in the community.

She told the Los Angeles Times that seven years ago her son, then 14, came across three wolves while out walking and backed against a tree as the animals circled him.

He cocked his gun and the wolves ran off, but 'it was a miracle he wasn't killed,' Nelson said.

Caren Cowan, the executive director of the 
New Mexico Cattle Growers' Association, said that the wolves were bred in 
captivity and reintroduced into the wild, leaving them unafraid of people.

'In 
Catron County, the wolves were following some kids home from schools, 
some of them could no longer walk to the bus stop like they used to,' 
Cowan told FoxNews.com.

'They are a constant problem and we spend a 
great deal of time and effort on this issue.'

The approximately 20 cages in Reserve were installed on the orders of Reserve Independent Schools, Catron County Sheriff Shawn Menge said.

She explained how earlier this year, one of the wolves frightened a mother and her son near a bus stop. When she tried to make it leave, it moved towards the mother instead, she said.

The Fish and Wildlife Service removed the young male wolf by shooting it with an arrow, but the story quickly spread, unsettling residents.

But Eva Sargent, director of Southwest programs for Defenders of Wildlife, said that keeping the cages was politically motivated, rather than based on safety concerns.

While there are some - albeit few - reports of animals attacking livestock, they rarely attack humans. Even with the livestock, domestic dogs kill 20 times as many sheep as wolves do, data shows.

Speaking out: David Spady, the producer of an anti-wolf film, said the Endangered Species Act was an example of the government meddling in an issue without knowing how it actually affects people

'There's been absolutely zero, nada, zilch attacks on humans by wolves in the Southwest, so I think these cages are a reaction to a non-problem,' Sargent told Fox.

'For some people, it's a political ploy to bring attention to other things. A lot of the fear stirred up by these kid cages, at the base of it, is an anti-government fear and the wolves are standing in for that.'

Yet, still residents in the West say the decision should be up to them, not Washington.

'The wolf is symbolic of a larger fact,' David Spady, the producer of an anti-wolf documentary told the LA Times. 'The federal government is running roughshod over private property 
rights.

'We at the local level believe that we understand the 
needs of our place, rather than somebody in Washington, D.C.'
