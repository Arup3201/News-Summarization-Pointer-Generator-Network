Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has described recent initiatives by tech companies such as Facebook and Google to bring internet access to the entire world and position online connectivity as a humanitarian concern as ‘a joke’.

The world’s richest person according to the Bloomberg Billionaires List, Gates has devoted himself to humanitarian causes since stepping down from a full-time role at Microsoft in 2006.

While Gates, 58, said technology is ‘amazing’, he doesn’t believe it is on the ‘first five rungs’ of basic human needs.

‘I certainly love the IT thing,’ Gates told The Financial Times. ‘But when we want to improve lives, you've got to deal with more basic things like child survival, child nutrition.’

‘PCs are not, in the hierarchy of human needs, in the first five rungs,’ he added.

Gates' comments come just a few months after Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook wants to get more of the world's more than seven billion people online through a partnership with some of the world's largest mobile technology companies.

Known as Internet.org, the initiative was launched in August and also includes South Korean electronics giant Samsung, Finnish handset maker Nokia and wireless chip maker Qualcomm.

Facebook said the group's goal is to ‘make internet access available to the two-thirds of the world who are not yet connected’ - about five billion people.

Google isn’t part of the Internet.org, but launched a similar initiative earlier in the year with the goal of getting everyone on Earth online.

Project Loon uses high-altitude balloons placed in the stratosphere at an altitude of about 20km to create an aerial wireless network with up to 3G-like speeds.

While Gates said that improvements in technology certainly bring important benefits, they won't meet the more pressing needs of the world's most desperate people.

When asked by the FT if internet connectivity is more important than finding a vaccination for malaria, the Microsoft co-founder sad: ‘As a priority? It's a joke.’

‘If you think connectivity is the key thing, that’s great. I don’t,’ he added.

Although Gates remains involved with Microsoft in a part-time capacity and continues as chairmen, his focus since 2006 has been the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

Gates has so far given US$28 billion of his fortune to the foundation and much of that money has been spent on improving health and fighting poverty in developing countries by tackling malaria or paying for vaccination drives against infectious diseases.
