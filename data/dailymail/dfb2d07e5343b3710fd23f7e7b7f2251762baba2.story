Connor Daniels and Jordan Irving stole a number of high-end cars including an  a BMW 3 Series, a Mercedes A-Class and an Audi TT, in a series of raids on homes in Manchester.

The men were caught after pictures of them posing in the stolen vehicles were discovered by officers searching Daniels' bedroom. Daniels, 19, also posted images of himself on Facebook.

Daniels and Irving took the cars during a 10-month stealing spree, ending last June, Manchester Crown Court heard. There was no evidence that they earned any money on the stolen vehicles.  

Daniels, from Manchester, was handed a suspended two-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to 10 counts of handling stolen goods. He was ordered to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work. 

Irving, 23, admitted four counts of handling stolen goods and was jailed for 14 months.

Daniels, who describes himself as 'The Stig' on Facebook, was spared jail after the court heard that he had turned his life around since the thefts.

In a statement, his girlfriend's father said that the 19-year-old had started working with him as a labourer and had moved in with his family. 

Judge Atherton said: 'He put it as "we're a working class family and we work, and he knows that". One thing you will always have is that family to say thank you to.' 

'If you let them down, no-one can complain if they throw away the key.'

Defending Daniels, Max Saffman said: 'Now he's working he realises you can buy things when you earn and this has given him more empathy towards the victims of his crimes.'
