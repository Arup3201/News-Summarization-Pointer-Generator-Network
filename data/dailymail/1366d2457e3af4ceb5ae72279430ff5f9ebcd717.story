A senior Republican lawmaker
has told President Barack Obama she was prepared to block
foreign aid money if the administration did not provide fighter
jets and tanks to Egypt and arms to other regional allies
fighting Islamic State militants.

In a letter to Obama, Kay Granger, the Republican chairwoman of the House
of Representatives State and Foreign Operations Appropriations
subcommittee, said Egypt needs F-16 aircraft, M1A1 Abrams tanks
and other weapons that have been held up since 2013. Granger has
the power to place holds on foreign aid, including general
assistance and weapons shipments.

Granger urged the administration to give Iraqi Kurds tools
and training to fight Islamic State and to make providing
weapons to Jordan a priority, according to the letter, seen by
Reuters on Friday.

Dated Thursday, the letter criticized the administration as
Congress is about to consider Obama's request for formal
authority for a military campaign against Islamic State.

Texas Republican Rep. Kay Granger, a member of the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee and Chairwoman of the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, is threatening to hold up foreign aid dollars if the president refuses to release aircraft to Egypt

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi wants more firepower to attack the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham; he has warned Egypt will strike back at any militant threats to its security

Republicans, who took control of the U.S. Congress in
January, have pressed for more robust U.S. military involvement
in fighting the militants, who have killed thousands of
civilians while seizing territory in Iraq and Syria.

'As Egypt, Jordan, and the Kurds retaliate and defend
themselves against ISIL's heinous acts, U.S. security assistance
is being held or delayed by bureaucratic processes and
ill-advised policy decisions by your administration,' Granger
wrote, using an acronym for Islamic State.

The U.S. State Department referred requests for comment to
the White House, where officials did not immediately respond. 

Granger said she was calling on the White House to
'immediately release' remaining weapons and funds to Egypt,
provide Jordan with weapons it had requested and ensure the
Kurdish Peshmerga have equipment they need.

'I am prepared to do everything within my power to make sure
this occurs, including placing holds on Congressional
Notifications (spending plans) and drafting legislation to hold
your Administration accountable,' Granger wrote.

Egyptian warplanes bombed sites in Libya on Monday in
response to the beheading of 21 Egyptian Christians by Islamic
State militants there.

Lockheed Martin Corp, which makes the F-16, said the
aircraft built for Egypt were part of a foreign military sales
agreement between the United States and Egypt. The Abrams tanks
are made by General Dynamics Corp.

Twelve of 20 F-16s built by Lockheed under its last contract
with Egypt are in storage at Lockheed's Fort Worth, Texas,
facility. They have been formally transferred to the U.S.
government, which is paying Lockheed to store and maintain them.

The current U.S. policy on Egypt is to hold up many
shipments of big-ticket weapons until Washington can certify
that Cairo has made progress on human rights.

Granger represents the district where Lockheed's facility is
based, but the company would not necessarily profit from a move
to release the planes since the U.S. government has already paid
Lockheed for them.

U.S. officials said last week that planning was well under
way to help replenish Jordan's supplies of ordnance. Jordan's
King Abdullah visited Congress earlier this month, the same day
Islamic State released a video of the murder of a Jordanian
pilot.

The administration has said it is supplying guns and
ammunition to the Kurds, who are fighting Islamic State in
northern Iraq, but it is channeling them through Baghdad. 

Some
Republicans have said the supplies should go directly to the
Kurds.

Egypt is already getting 24 Rafale combat jets from France, under the terms of a hastily negotiated contract with Dassault Aviation.

By giving the green light via his defence minister on Thursday, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi gave the ailing French airplane project a major boost while demonstrating his domestic resolve to make sure ISIS doesn't overrun his country from neighboring Libya. 

'Egypt needs planes quickly,' said Patricia Adam, president of the French parliament's defence committee. 

'You just need to take a look at what's happening at its border. They are especially worried by what's happening in Libya.'
