Almost 11 million TV and radio programmes were watched and listened to on the BBC’s iPlayer on New Year’s Day, the highest ever daily viewing figures for the online service.

Yesterday, the BBC described 2013 as ‘the year of the tablet’ after its popularity as a Christmas present saw viewing of the iPlayer service on the devices overtake computers for the first time.

On Boxing Day there were 2.2m iPlayer requests from tablets, compared to 2.1m from computers.

Fees: The BBC may be bringing in £5 charges to use iPlayer to rival Netflix and iTunes

By New Year’s Eve, tablet requests had dropped back to 1.93m, just a fraction behind computer requests at 1.95m.

The huge figures for tablet viewing of the iPlayer service on New Year’s Day is a jump of 35 percent on New Year’s Day 2013, when 8.1m used the devices. During the festive period of 2012 tablet usage was typically less than half that of computer viewing on the iPlayer.

At present, viewers are not required to pay the £145.50 television licence if they use the iPlayer solely as a catch-up service to see programmes after they have been broadcast.

If customers stream programmes live through their computers on iPlayer, they are still required to pay the full fee, regardless of whether or not they have a television. One TV licence per family is required.

Last month it was suggested that the BBC is planning to charge up to £5 for its hit programmes as part of an ambitious revamp to challenge online services such as Netflix and iTunes.

The BBC said there were 941,000 downloads of the iPlayer mobile and tablet apps over the festive period, from 21 December to New Year’s Day. The Christmas Day edition of Doctor Who was the most popular BBC show on the iPlayer over the festive period, with 1.96m viewing requests.

'Year of the tablet': On Boxing Day there were 2.2m iPlayer requests from tablets, compared to 2.1m from computers

Gangsta Granny, a comedy based on David Walliams’ children’s book, had almost double the number of requests on tablets compared to computers – indicating the popularity of the devices with families.

Dan Taylor, head of the BBC iPlayer, said: ‘With new gadgets being at the top of many Christmas wishlists, we see a lot of new devices accessing BBC iPlayer over the holiday period.

‘2013 truly proved to be the year of the tablet and after they were all unwrapped, Boxing Day saw tablet viewing overtake computer viewing for the first time in iPlayer history.’

He added: ‘BBC iPlayer has an important role as a complementary platform for BBC broadcast programmes, especially on Boxing Day and New Year’s Day, when requests on iPlayer really start to peak and you have time to catch-up on the must-watch Christmas programmes.’

The UK has the largest market for tablet sales in Europe, with more than 2.6m devices shipped between July and September 2013, more than the combined total of laptops and desktop PCs. Tablets have grown in popularity since the launch of the first Apple iPad in 2010.

Experts believe more people are turning to mobile devices because they are cheaper and lighter. It also allows more people to watch television programmes whilst they are commuting or on holiday.
