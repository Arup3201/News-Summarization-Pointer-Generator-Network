A student who took her life just hours before a classmate also killed herself was devastated over a leg injury that would keep her from joining the Navy, her stepdad has revealed.

Ciara Webb, 16, shot herself dead in her home in Olathe, Kansas on November 7 - just two days before her friend and soccer teammate Cady Housh, 16, stepped in front of a freight train.

Now, as the small town struggles to deal with unimaginable tragedy, Webb's stepfather has revealed that his daughter had asked to stay home from a trip to a shooting range - and took her life instead.

Mike Gage told People magazine that his daughter had stayed home from school, which was not unusual because she had undergone five surgeries since a leg injury two years before.

Loss: Ciara Webb, 16, shot herself dead last month, just two days before a classmate took her life. Her step-father revealed she had long struggled with a leg injury and had to drop out of the soccer team

Tragic: Two days after Ciara died, her classmate, 16-year-old Cady Housh, pictured, also took her life

She often attended doctors appointments and sometimes her parents allowed her to stay home when she was in pain because she was a good student, Gage said.

The injury meant that she had dropped out of the soccer team in September and it also seemed unlikely that she would be able to join the Naval Academy, where she dreamed of training as a diver.

On her day off, they had multiple activities planned - a meal at a steak restaurant, a trip to the shooting range and then a film - but instead she asked to stay home and watch TV.

Gage said they had noticed she had been quieter in recent weeks and happier to spend time alone. When they spoke to her about it, she said she just wanted to get on with her life and go to college.

But when the family left her alone in the house that day, she took her life.

The school was notified and students, including Cady Housh, were shaken by the news. Friends said she seemed upset at soccer practice, but pointed out that they were all devastated.

On Sunday, she posted a message to Twitter reading: 'Worst weekend of my f***ing life.'

That evening, she stepped in front of a train in Lenexa. The driver saw her and called authorities but was unable to stop the train, and she was killed.

Authorities have said that they do not believe there is a connection between the two deaths, but friends say they think otherwise.

'She said if she had reached out to [Ciara] more, then it wouldn't have happened,' friend Abby Conner told People. 'She wasn't thinking rationally. She said, "I wish I could have done something".' 

Heartbreaking: Cady posted this message to Twitter just hours before she stepped in front of a train

Remembered: Hundreds gathered at a candlelit vigil for the teenagers days after they took their lives

The school and small town are now trying to deal with the tragedies.  

'You dreaded going into the hallways,' ONW high student Katie MacDonald told the Kansas City Star. 'Class was fine, because I'm a freshman. But when you went into the hallways, that's when people that knew (the first victim) were there.'

Friends told People that people continue to cry in the lunchroom.

The girls were remembered at a candlelit vigil days after the double tragedy.

One of their fathers told the crowd to share their feelings with one another to prevent anything similar from happening ever again because he never would have predicted his daughter would take her life.
