A woman was filmed as she was sexually abusing a toddler and having sex with a dog.

Angeline Lodice, of New Orleans, Louisiana, was arrested on Monday after the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office obtained videos and photos that showed her engaging in intercourse with a canine and sexually abusing a 3-year-old boy.

She has been charged with aggravated rape of a victim under the age of 13, pornography involving juveniles, crimes against nature and sexual battery.

Admitting: Lodice (above) has said while it is here in the videos and photos, she was drugged at the time 

According to a police report obtained by The Times-Picayune, Lodice, 26, has admitted that the woman in the photos and video are her, but she did not identify the boy as she claims she was drugged.

If charged and convicted of aggravated rape, she faces a mandatory life sentence.

The abuse came to light after the father of the child was contacted by a relative of Lodice, who said he received photographs and videos of her and the child.

She is currently being held at Jefferson Parish Correctional Center. 

Lodice, who also goes by Angel, is a tattoo artist according to her Twitter account.
