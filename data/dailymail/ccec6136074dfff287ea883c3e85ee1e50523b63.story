American workers are taking just half of their holiday leave every year - despite only being entitled to 10 days, according to a study.

And when they do finally go on holiday, 61 per cent of them continue to work while they are out of the office.

With US workers failing to take advantage of their hard-earned time off, a staggering 429 million days of accrued holiday entitlement went unclaimed last year. And America's children are clearly not impressed that their parents are lagging behind those from other nations.

Stupid: A young boy says the unused 429 million days of accrued holiday is the 'stupidest thing I've ever heard'

MasterCard, which commissioned the study, has unveiled a new television ad featuring child actors who admonish their parents for not booking a family getaway.

When informed that adults allowed 429 million days of accrued holiday to expire, a little boy says bluntly: 'That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.'

The study found that the average American worker receives just 10 days of holiday per year and last year only used half of their allocated time.

It doesn't appear the trend has changed in 2014 as only half of Americans have taken a holiday or are planning one this year.

According to the study, the US is the only developed country in the world where it is not mandatory for employers to reward their employees with holiday pay, meaning over 28 million Americans do not receive any payment during their holidays.

And most American workers are not even aware that guaranteed holiday time is common practice in other developed countries.

A report by the Council Economic and Policy Research last year found that the average 16-day paid holiday given to workers by private companies in the US was below the minimum lawful holiday time required in 19 developed economies.

In MasterCard's 'One More Day' advert, children present a compelling list of reasons why their parents should take more time off, citing the importance of family time and experiencing different cultures.
