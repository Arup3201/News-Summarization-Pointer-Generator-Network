'Dickie' enjoyed some sport and recreation, and now guests will be able to enjoy pool and table tennis 

Its neighbouring three-bedroom cottage, which is still owned by his widow Sheila, is also up for hire for £500-£900 per week.

Lord Attenborough, who died in August aged 90, bought the 1,700 acre Rhubodach estate on the island in 1988.

The filmmaker, known to friends as 'Dickie', said he fell in love with the island and the house at first sight and described it as 'having the unmistakable feel of home'.

In 2010 he sold the surrounding forestry estate to a community buy-out group for £1.5 million but kept his house and its outbuildings.

Rhubodach House boasts 'stunning views' and has a master bedroom with brass four poster bed, a large living room and dining area with open fire and a Victorian bath.

The property also has a games room with a pool table, table tennis and darts board and is kitted out with flat screen televisions and DVD players, or just two miles away there is a shop and pub.

Nearby sightseeing can be enjoyed at the Victorian Gothic mansion of Mount Stuart, Bute Museum, Rothesay Castle and the gardens of Ascog Hall and Ardencraig.

The cottage is decked out with framed film posters of Charlie Chaplin. Attenborough was a huge fan of the silent film star and directed and produced the 1992 biopic Chaplin starring Robert Downey Junior in the title role.

A sales brochure for the property reads: 'Rhubodach on the lovely Scottish Isle of Bute consists of The Farmhouse plus annex and Flora's Cottage, beautiful holiday properties available for self catering or managed self catering.

'With gorgeous accommodation surrounded by stunning scenery, overlooking the Kyles of Bute and for good measure set in a 28 acre nature reserve. Scotland at its finest and perfect for that stress free break.

'At Rhubodach there is a warm welcome waiting for you and we can offer various services such as cooking meals and clearing away afterwards.'

In a piece he wrote for a Bute tourist guide, produced in 2013, Lord Attenborough told of his love for his adopted Scots home.

He said: 'My wife Sheila and I had no idea what to expect. We had decided to invest in and support the natural world in some way and someone suggested that we take a look at the Isle of Bute.

'What we found exceeded all expectation. It was love at first sight.

'We knew almost immediately that this was somewhere we wanted to live; the awesome peace and expansive beauty totally captivated us.

'The house itself was clearly packed with potential and had that unmistakeable feel of home.

'Decades later, we still look upon it as a home, even though our advanced years mean we don't get there as often as we would like.

'It has over time been a gathering place for the Attenborough clan, as our children have blessed us with beautiful grand-children, all of whom have shared our love of the island.

'We count ourselves truly lucky to have such a special home.'

A spokeswoman for Cottages4you said they were unable to comment on the property's ownership. The company also does not mention the celebrity connection in its promotional material.
