An American citizen who underwent al Qaeda training only to later quit the extremist group revealed he was asked to carry out a mid-air assassination against Hosni Mubarak back in 1995.

Ihab Mohammad Ali, testifying against alleged al Qaeda leader Khaled al-Fawwaz, says he was asked by Osama bin Laden to use his private plane to ram a plane carrying the Egyptian president.

'It took me by surprise,' said 52-year old Ali while testifying in New York federal court. 'I responded, "Well, wouldn't I be killing myself?"'

Bin Laden, who is believed to have only carried out small-scale terror attacks at that time responded: 'Well, then you would be a martyr.'

Ali's testified against Al-Fawwaz at US Federal District Court in Manhattan. On Thursday the government rested its case against Al-Fawwaz, who pleads not guilty to conspiring to kill Americans in the 1998 US embassy bombings.

The Egyptian-born Ali says he came to the US when he was 11, living first in New York and then Florida with his family, becoming a US citizen before moving to Pakistan in 1988.

In 1990, the year he swore allegiance to al Qaeda, Ali says he met bin Laden, who had recently come back from Afghanistan having found success against Soviet forces.

Ali also said he was there with more than two dozen al Qaeda members the day bin Laden announced he was shifting the jihadist group's base of operations to Sudan.

Now working variously as a dispatcher and waiter, Ali described his own trajectory within the group, receiving $9,000 in 1993 to undertake pilot's training at schools in Oklahoma and California.

Crash: bin Laden's plane had faulty brakes, causing it to crash at the end of a runway in Khartoum, which led to the plot against Mubarak to be aborted

The next year, he received thousands more, having spoken about the training to bin Laden, who 'agreed with it.'

The two were in close communication, according to Ali, who said he went camping with bin Laden when the two were in Sudan.

The plot against Mubarak was planned while the king of Saudi Arabia was very ill, with bin Laden saying that Egypt's then president would fly to the funeral if the king died.

'He said if I had the chance, to ram his plane with mine midair,' Ali told jurors.

But bin Laden's private jet, which Ali used and trained on while in Khartoum, had faulty brakes and crashed at the end of a runway in Sudan in 1995.

Bin Laden requested the plane be fixed, but when Ali contacted a US company about repairs, they returned a $1million quote and the plan was scrapped.

Ali, who had also instructed members of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, a group that was later absorbed into al Qaeda, on reading flight maps and interpreting air traffic control radio transmissions.

The group claimed responsibility for various bombings and attacks throughout the 1990s while it was fighting the Mubarak regime.

Ali quit al Qaeda in 1996 to return to the United States, receiving $2,400 'severance' pay, but still communicated with leadership after his departure.

Speaking in code, referring to Osama as'Sam' and the FBI as the 'Food and Beverage Industry,' Ali passed on communication to al Qaeda members.

'Lastly, again give my regards to Sam and tell him to take extra precautions because business competition is very fierce,' he once wrote in a letter as a warning that bin Laden faced the risk of arrest. 

Ali came under scrutiny in 1999 after the embassy bombings, but told FBI agents he had never been to Sudan. He later testified before a New York grand jury he did not know bin Laden.

In March 2001, he pleaded guilty to perjury, criminal contempt and conspiring to kill Americans, and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. At sentencing in 2009, he received time served and was released.
