Understaffed A&E departments are spending more than £80million a year hiring locum doctors, figures show.

The average casualty unit is paying £750,000 annually for temporary medics to plug rota gaps, with some shelling out more than £4million.

A&E is in the grip of a recruitment crisis with most junior doctors put off by the intense work, antisocial hours and low pay.

At the same time rising numbers of trained casualty doctors are quitting the NHS to work abroad where salaries are higher and standards of care better.

Hospitals are having to rely increasingly on expensive locums who tend to be less competent, more inexperienced and prone to mistakes as they are unfamiliar with equipment.

Figures obtained by Labour show hospitals spent £83million on locums last year, up from £74million in 2011/12 and £51.6million in 2009/10.

North West London hospitals spent £4.3million, followed by £3.8million by Barking, Havering and Redbridge in Essex.

Last week, the Mail revealed some A&E units were paying GPs £1,500 a shift to work evenings and weekends

This latter trust has the highest number of vacant A&E posts in the country and 13 out of 21 consultant jobs are currently empty.

Last week the Mail revealed some short-staffed A&E units were paying GPs £1,500 a shift to work evenings and weekends.

Concern: Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the NHS's locum bill is 'spiralling out of control'

Some 40 per cent of casualties now employ family doctors to deal with less urgent cases.

GPs have been able to opt-out of working evenings and weekends since 2004 and this is thought to have triggered a surge in patients at A&E.

Dr Cliff Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, which represents A&E doctors, said: ‘It’s about the experience and training of locums compared to permanent staff, and the cost.

‘If you were to ask any chief executive or patient groups whether they’d rather continue employing short-term, variable locums or double the number of consultants you can be pretty sure what they’d say.

‘These people won’t have done the same training or have the same brand experience as doctors in permanent posts.’

Locums include full-time doctors doing extra shifts as well as those employed with agencies – who can be less competent.

NHS officials say the next few weeks will be particularly busy for A&E units due to the cold weather. Last week three hospitals – Milton Keynes, Peterborough and Cambridge – warned they were running out of beds.

Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham accused David Cameron of leaving the NHS with a ‘dangerous shortage’ of A&E doctors and a locum bill which is ‘spiralling out of control’.

‘This Government is guilty of gross mismanagement of the NHS,’ he said. ‘They are paying more for an A&E service which is getting worse by the week. And things have got so bad that many doctors are deciding to quit.’
