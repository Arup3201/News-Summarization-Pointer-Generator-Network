The government has created a video to explain to the heartbroken families of missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 victims why their loved ones have still not been found after eight months.

Flight MH370 disappeared on March 8 2014 carrying 239 people, including six Australians, while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

In the four-minute video, posted by the Joint Agency Coordination Centre on YouTube, authorities attempt to explain why the search mission has taken so long and why the search area continues to be based along the seventh arc in the southern Indian Ocean, an area with incredibly deep water and rough conditions.

The arc is described as 'a thin long line that identifies all the possible points the last communication between the aircraft and the communication satellite could have taken place'.

The aerial search for MH370 has been scaled back but a deep sea underwater search continues 

Trying to calm recent fears that the search operation could be stopped, the video says: 'The expert satellite working group is continually refining analysis of the available data to identify the areas of the highest priority for the search.'

Relatives of MH370 passengers were outraged last week after a senior Malaysia Airlines representative allegedly said the beleaguered carrier is planning on officially declaring the plane 'lost', which would call off the search.

Commercial director Hugh Dunleavy said authorities are working to set a date, likely by the end of the year, to formally announce the loss of the Boeing 777.

An organisation representing families of the MH370 passengers, called Voice370, said Mr Dunleavy's comments, denied by both Malaysia Airlines and Australia, had brought 'intense agony and confusions to family members'.

The new video illustrates that the water is up to 6km deep in some points making it hard to search

The official search area revolves around the seventh arc in the Indian Ocean

In the new video, families are reassured that Australia, Malaysia and China 'are all contributing significant assets and resources' to finding MH370.

But it’s explained that the plane is believed to be in a remote region of the Indian ocean were the water is up to 6km deep in some areas.

Search operators are 'mapping the sea floor with sonar waves to gather detailed information about the shape and composition of sea floor'.

Once they've got enough information it can 'guide the underwater vehicles used in the search operation'.

Queensland couple Robert and Catherine Lawton were also on the flight

The video reasoned that because the water is so deep 'daylight can only penetrate in some areas' and on the 'deep sea floor there is no sunlight' making the search extremely difficult.

JACC Chief Coordinator Judith Zielke recently said she wants the search vessels to cover the entire 55,000 square kilometre 'high priority area' by May.

There were three Australian couples on board MH370 when it disappeared and one New Zealand man.

Queensland couple and doting grandparents Robert and Catherine Lawton, who lived at Springfield Lakes in Brisbane's south-west, were on their annual holiday.

The primary search area - dubbed the ‘priority’ area - is around the seventh arc 

They were travelling with fellow Brisbane couple Rod and Mary Burrows, who had three children and were reportedly expecting their first grandchild in April.

And Sydney couple Gu Naijun and Li Yuan, originally from China, were reportedly on a business trip.

Ms Gu, 31 and Mr Li, 33, owned a petrol station at Miranda in southern Sydney.

Meanwhile, Perth-based New Zealand man Paul Weeks was en route to Mongolia to begin a fly-in, fly-out job with a mining contractor.

He had two young children with his wife Danica.

Australia, China and Malaysia are all involved in the search efforts
