An Army officer in Washington state threatened to blow up the state capitol, personally kill his girlfriend, and hired a hit man for $150,000 to kill his estranged wife and his superior officer.

Lt. Col. Robert E. Underwood, who was arrested Monday night and pleaded not guilty to felony harassment charges, was stationed at the same base as the soldier who made headlines over the weekend for allegedly killing 16 Afghan civilians in a shooting spree.

Underwood threatened to kill girlfriend Serena Kiptoo after she confronted him about a naked photograph of his daughter on his laptop computer.

High alert: Joint Base Lewis-McChord just outside of Seattle, Washington was the home to Lt. Col. Robert E. Underwood- who was arrested Monday night after allegedly hiring a hit man to kill his ex-wife and superior officer

Court documents say that he then told her that he'd paid a hit man $150,000 to kill both his wife and superior officer.

He was charged with three counts of felony harassment and is being held in the Pierce County jail on $250,000 bail after entering a not guilty plea during his Superior Court arraignment on Tuesday.

Investigation: The base is now being scrutinized as it was also the base of the soldier accused of killing 16 civilians in Afghanistan

Though he also reportedly threatened to blow up the Washington State Capitol when he was arrested, he was not charged with any crimes relating to the threat.

‘That's what the evidence supports, that's what we can prove, but it's an ongoing investigation,’ Pierce County prosecutor Mark Lindquist said.

Underwood and his wife have been going through a divorce, and recent court hearings regarding money and custody of their children had not gone in his favor.

His estranged wife, Kara Underwood, told the court that he had told their daughter ‘he was going to do something crazy and it would be on the news, the world would know about’.

She saw this as a feasible threat 
because ‘has nothing to lose, he has an arsenal of weapons and she 
believes he has the ability to save the $150,000 and hide it.’

It
is not clear whether or not Underwood had actually hired a hit man 
before he was arrested, though that is still being investigated.

‘The
victims obviously had a concern that he meant it, but we don't know 
what steps, if any, were actually taken,’ Mr Lindquist said.

Underwood faces up to five years in prison, but standard sentencing range would be between four and twelve months, he said.

Mr
Lindquist said Underwood has been deployed multiple times and the 
military has concluded he does not suffer PTSD, though there may be 
other mental health issues to be considered.

According to court documents, Underwood witnessed his mother kill his two siblings when he was a young child, and she shot Underwood multiple times and left him for dead.

The arrest is adding more scrutiny to the troubled Joint Base Lewis-McChord as it is the same one that produced the soldier at the heart of the Afghanistan shooting.

The name of the 38-year-old soldier in custody at a base in Kandahar has not been released pending charges. The soldier was deployed to Afghanistan on December 3 with the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Stryker Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, based at Joint Base Lewis-McChord.

Authorities did not release information about Underwood's unit and a Lewis-McChord spokesman did not immediately provide that information.
