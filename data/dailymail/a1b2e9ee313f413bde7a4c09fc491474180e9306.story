Sometimes it’s better to be lucky than good.

Christmas came two days early when the NHL’s Buffalo Sabres won in overtime on what is likely the most unusual goal ever scored in hockey history.

Monday night’s game against the Phoenix Coyotes was tied 1-1 in overtime when goalie Mike Smith’s save of a Sabres shot sent the puck straight up into the air – what happened next may never happen again.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

What goes up, must come down: The puck goes straight up in the air before landing in the back of Phoenix Coyotes' goalie Mike Smith's pants

Swing and a miss: Coyotes center Martin Hanzal (11) tries to swipe the errant puck out of the air but misses

The puck went straight up into the air for what must have seemed an eternity to the Coyotes’ Martin Hanzal. 

The center tried in vain to swipe the puck away from the goal as it tumbled back down to the ice.

The puck then somehow ended up in the back of Mr Smith’s pants.

Look! Look!: Buffalo Sabres players shout to the refs and point at the puck sitting in the back of Mr Smith's pants

Is it a goal?: The referee can clearly see the puck in the back of Mr Smith's pants - and across the goal line - but a video review was used to confirm the score

Without a clue as to where the puck was, the goalie instinctively backed into the net to block whatever shot may have come at him.

That’s what cost his team the game.

When he backed into the net, his pants crossed the goal line – with the puck inside.

Multiple Sabres players began shouting and pointing at the puck inside the net while in the goalie’s pants.

A video review confirmed the goal, giving the Sabres the bizarre win.

Clearly a goal: Though video replay was used to confirm the goal, the puck is clearly visible inside Mr Smith's pants - and, crucially, across the goal line

Better lucky than good: The win was only the 10th of the season for the last place Buffalo Sabres

It was Sabres player Mark Pysyk's first goal of the season, and only the second of his career.

A Buffalo announcer was in disbelief.

‘I’ve never seen anything like this before, ever.’

It was only the tenth win of the season for the last place Sabres.
