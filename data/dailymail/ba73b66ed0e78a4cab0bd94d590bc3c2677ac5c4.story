Gordon Strachan admitted on Tuesday that he faces a huge dilemma over who should be his Scotland captain.

Fit-again Darren Fletcher and Celtic skipper Scott Brown are vying for the armband ahead of Wednesday's friendly with Northern Ireland and Sunday’s Euro qualifier with Gibraltar.

Brown was Strachan’s pick when Fletcher was missing with a chronic bowel disease or on the bench for recent internationals.

Since leaving Manchester United for West Brom in January, however, the 31-year-old has staked a claim to add to his 66 caps in the upcoming games.

And Strachan admitted: ‘I’ve got a hard decision to make. I’m trying to make sure everybody gets involved in the games. I want to be fair on the club managers.

‘At this moment, I haven’t picked the team so I can’t pick a captain. Once I pick the team, I’ll have an idea.

‘I know the system, the players know the system.

‘I have other decisions to make as well. Who’s the goalie? Who’s going to be the main one up front? Who’s going to be the wide players? They are smashing decisions to have to make.’

Strachan has almost a full squad to choose from for both games – with Ross McCormack the only call-off.
