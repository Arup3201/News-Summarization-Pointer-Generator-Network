A French bell foundry in Normandy has cast the final bronze bell of eight huge replacements bound for the
north tower of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.

The bell, called Anne-Genevieve, was cast using medieval methods at Cornille Havard in Villedieu-les-Poeles on Friday.

The 12th-century Gothic cathedral will inaugurate its set of nine new bells in February, one of the highlights in a 
series of events marking the 
beginning of the cathedral's 850th anniversary.

After the 
revolution, the north tower's bells were replaced in 1856, but they will
replaced again with bells made of better quality metal that will 
produce a clearer sound.

Some of the bells were taken out of 
use when it was discovered that ringing them caused the building to 
shake, threatening its structural integrity.

The new bells will be inaugurated in February 2013 and will sound on Palm Sunday, a month later.

Archbishop Andre Vingt-Trois and Paris Mayor Bertrand Delanoe joined thousands
of dignitaries, tourists and Parisians on Wednesday for a ceremony and 
Mass marking the beginning of year-long commemoration of Notre Dame 
Cathedral's 850th anniversary.

Each year, 14 million tourists visit the cathedral, which holds five Masses a day during the week, and seven on Sunday. The structure took nearly 90 years to build

Speaking outside the cathedral before 
celebrating Mass on Wednesday, the archbishop said Notre Dame de Paris 
is 'a symbol for Parisians and for people across the world.'

After the Mass, French Interior 
Minister Manuel Valls spoke in front of the huge wooden doors of the 
cathedral's Portal of the Last Judgment.

Noting
that the cathedral had survived the reigns of '80 kings, two emperors 
and five republics,' Valls said the cathedral's 850th anniversary 'is 
moving for all who see in its towers the image of France in all its 
greatness.'

Each year, 14 million tourists visit the cathedral, which holds five Masses a day during the week, and seven on Sunday. The structure took nearly 90 years to build.

Last September, the largest of the nine new bells was cast at a foundry in Holland.

The six-ton bell, named Marie, was cast in a blend of copper and tin using a centuries-old formula at Holland's Royal Eijsbouts Bell Foundry.

Many of the original bells were removed during the French Revolution. It is thought the looted bells were melted down to make cannon balls

French Interior Minister Manuel Valls said the cathedral's 850th anniversary 'is moving for all who see in its towers the image of France in all its greatness'

Marie will be a long-awaited replacement
for a much older bell of the same name that was removed during the 
French Revolution, when insurgents took over the cathedral and removed 
all of its bells except the largest one, which is called Emmanuel. It is
thought the looted bells were melted down to make cannon balls.

Emmanuel has been tolled to mark the end of the First and Second Wars, the liberation of the city in 1944, and major state occasions, as well as ringing on the hour. It was also rung on September 11, 2001 after the attacks on the Twin Towers in New York.

The foundry worked with the Technical University of Eindhoven to create computer software that would allow the foundry to design a bell as well as hear it. The shape of the bell determines how it sounds.

The idea is to make music from the cathedral sound as it did before the French Revolution. Experts have found manuscripts indicating what note the original bell would have produced.
