Probe: Barclays Bank was at the centre of fresh police investigation today after documents and emails were seized from the offices of its Italian HQ. Its headquarters in London are pictured

Barclays Bank was at the centre of fresh police investigation today after documents and emails were seized from the offices of its Italian headquarters.

The raids were ordered by prosecutors and took place just before the start of the business day as stunned employees arrived for work to find officers stationed outside the main entrance.

Officials said the raid was part of a probe into the possible manipulation of Euribor, the euro-priced counterpart of scandal-hit Libor interbank lending rates.

According to sources close to the investigation, records of emails and other documents detailing exchanges of information between Barclays in Milan and London were being looked at.

The raid was led by Trani based prosecutor Michele Ruggiero, known for similar probes and sweeps on the three big New York-based ratings agencies - Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch.

The raid was part of a probe announced on July 20, which came on the heels of accusations from consumer groups Adusbef and Federconsumatori.      

The groups called on prosecutors in a number of Italian cities to investigate a slew of foreign banks, starting with Barclays, for manipulating the Euribor interbank interest rate.

The Italian consumer groups are up in arms after US authorities - the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) - ordered Barclays to pay a $200-million fine for 'attempted manipulation of and false reporting concerning LIBOR and Euribor benchmark interest rates' at the end of June.

Adusbef and Federconsumatori demanded a criminal investigation of not only Barclays, but also of the Royal Bank of Scotland, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and Lloyds Banking Group, by prosecutors in Rome, Milan, Trani and other cities. However, no action has yet been taken by prosecutors against the other banks.

The Italian consumer groups claim the banks caused an estimated 2.9 billion euros in damages to 2.5 million families in Italy, and said a class action suit may be filed on their behalf.

In a statement the prosecutor's office in Trani confirmed the raid on the 'Milan offices of the British bank Barclays' adding that 'numerous documents and emails have been taken away as part of the investigation into the Euribor rate which had a negative affect on the mortgages paid by Italians.'

Both consumer groups claim that the manipulation of the Euribor rates could have affected as many as 2.5 million families, costing them a total of three billion Euros.

Barclays was fined a record £290million over its involvement in the rigging 
of Libor, the inter-bank lending rate, which involved the manipulation of key interest rates by the bank.

The scandal began with a devastating dossier, published by the Financial Services Authority last month, about the ruthless tactics used by rogue traders at Barclays to fiddle Libor.

The 44-page report reveals extraordinary emails showing how traders promised to celebrate together with champagne and cappuccinos if they managed to pull off the con.

In one email, a trader at a different bank wrote to ‘Trader G’ at Barclays: ‘Dude. I owe you big time! Come over one day after work and I’m opening a bottle of Bollinger.’

The Libor scandal prompted the resignation of Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond.

Barclays Bank declined to comment on the raid in Milan.
