A scathing assessment by Kevin Rudd on Julia Gillard four years ago has revealed he thought she was nothing but a 'backstabber'.

The, not so glowing, report on Ms Gillard came months after Mr Rudd was ousted as Australia's Prime Minister in June 2010 and in the wake of a disastrous election campaign.

The secret submission to Labor's election review panel, partly obtained by The Australian, reported he unleashed on Ms Gillard and the 'faceless men' who supported her, including Bill Shorten, as he was deposed of as Prime Minister.

The Australian reports Mr Rudd described his toppling in June, 2010 as a 'shakespearean' plot line riddled with falsehoods about his government's performance, Labor's election chances and the notion a coup was in the 'national interest'.

He believes those excuses were designed to mask Ms Gillard's overconfident ambition. 

The blistering submission from Mr Rudd came in response to arguments by Ms Gillard and her supporters, there was a change in leadership needed. 

'This was an entirely fabricated post-facto rationale for a leadership change that was driven in large part by political ambition, an attempt to elevate the reasons for leadership change above crude politics to the highest reasons of state,' said Mr Rudd.  

Mr Rudd has also named former minister Tony Burke as one of Gillard's strongest supporters who he believes turned on him in belief this would lead to a position as deputy Prime Minister.

The Australian has also reported Mr Rudd defended his government and its policies in his assessment saying it had 'a clear political narrative'.

He wrote that Ms Gillard ran an 'internal campaign' to abolish the carbon pollution reduction scheme, a Rudd government policy, and suggested the former PM or her supporters were the ones behind a damaging leak to a newspaper.

According to the Australia Ms Gillard was not a big supporter of many of Mr Rudd's policies but he wrote that she never had any 'credible' alternative ideas herself.

The former deputy Prime Minister Wayne Swan also didn't go without a mention, Mr Rudd hitting out at his botched handling of the mining tax.

He wrote there was a 'fatal error of communication' with the mining industry and fellow ministers including Ms Gillard over the negotiation of the tax.

Mr Rudd's assessment also criticised the controversial Building the Education Revolution program and lashed out at former minister Mark Arbib, who he believes should have been held to account for the disastrous home insulation program, which led to four deaths. 

The secret assessment has been revealed as Ms Gillard's memoir, My Story, was published, accompanied by a tell all interview with journalist Ray Martin on Tuesday night.
