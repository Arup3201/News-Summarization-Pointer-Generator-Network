Derek Rose kept a file on Formula One heiress Tamara Ecclestone for more than 10 ten years after they split up because she cheated on him, a court heard today

Tamara Ecclestone's ex-boyfriend kept a file on the Formula One heiress for ten years after they split up because she cheated on him, a court heard today.

Derek Rose, 33, was briefly engaged to the daughter of billionaire racing boss Bernie Ecclestone when she was 17.

Ten years later he allegedly tried to blackmail Miss Ecclestone by persuading media studies student Jakir Uddin, 20, to email her agent demanding £200,000 otherwise he would sell ‘intimate secrets’ about their sex life.

Southwark Crown Court heard today when police raided Rose's home in Camden, north London, they found a box marked 'Tamara' which had a letter he had once sent to Mr Ecclestone along with holiday photos and press cuttings about his former flame.

Asked why he kept them, he said: 
'That’s my mum. Every time Tamara’s in the papers or on the news she 
feels the need to bring them round.

'I kept them so I had a story. If I ever showed it back to my grandkids I can say I used to go out with Tamara Ecclestone.'

Rose, whose name was Jonathan Ketterman 
at the time he dated Miss Ecclestone, also sold a 
'kiss-and-tell' story to the Mail on Sunday to get back at her for cheating on 
him, the court heard.

He said: 'But the journalists weren’t interested in Tamara, they were interested in Bernie.

'They were very clever and asked me 
questions about Bernie as well as Tamara, about Bernie getting beat up 
in a car once when we went to the cinema. In fact the story ended up 
being about Bernie rather than Tamara.

Trial: Tamara Ecclestone arrives at court yesterday, left, to give evidence against Derek Rose and Jakir Uddin, right, who are accused of trying to blackmail her 

'It made me look stupid and I’ve regretted it ever since. Obviously the £10,000 I got was nothing.'

Rose added: 'When we broke up I was quite bitter 
and I wanted to get back at her for breaking my heart at the time.

'I’d put two years into it and I didn’t see my son for two years.'

When interviewed by police he told how he
faxed a letter to the socialite and her billionaire father after she 
dumped him in 2002.

Former flame: Derek Rose told the court he sold his story to the Mail on Sunday after he and Miss Ecclestone broke up because she cheated on him

Rose said: 'I think I might have got a bit racial at one stage about the guy I believe she was cheating on me with so I faxed it to Bernie and to her, but I never heard anything back.'

Rose claims after his experience with the Mail on Sunday he never wanted to sell his story again and was against Uddin, of Birmigham, trying to sell a story to The Sun newspaper last year.

'I wouldn’t do it again for any money, no way,' he told the jury.

Rose and 20-year-old media student Uddin, of Birmingham, deny a single count of blackmail at Southwark Crown Court.

The trial continues.

The court heard that Derek Rose had sold his story to the Mail on Sunday because he was heartbroken after his romance with Tamara Ecclestone ended
