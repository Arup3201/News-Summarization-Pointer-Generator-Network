Smoke alarms in a house where four siblings were killed in a fire were not working when the tragedy occurred, firefighters revealed today.

Andrew Smith, 16, followed his older brother Reece into his mother's burning house in Freckleton, near Preston as they battled to rescue four-year-old twins Holly and Ella and two-year-old Jordan.

He was forced to flee the house after being blocked by thick toxic smoke pouring out of the attic bedroom where the tragic siblings were all unconscious.

But 19-year-old Reece was overcome by the smoke and died alongside his young brother and sisters. Post-mortem examinations gave the cause of the four deaths as smoke inhalation.

Today Lancashire Fire Service confirmed the smoke alarms were fitted but were not working when the fire started. The family allowed the Fire Service to reveal the information in the hope other families would test their smoke alarms to avert sdimilar tragedies.

The children’s grandmother Christine Smith, 57, thanked her grandson for his brave attempts to rescue his siblings.

She said: 'He tried to go in but he could not go any further because of 
the fire. He will have gone in after Reece. He went in to save his 
siblings and they have all lost their lives but Reece would do anything 
for them.'

Miss Smith said both her grandsons’ actions had been very brave but each of them would 'do anything for each other'.

She said: 'I think I would have done the same thing. The only thing they were thinking was to get their sisters and brother out.

'The same thing could have happened to Andrew as it did to his brother but luckily he got out.

'I would just like to thank Andrew for trying to help his sisters and brother. He was very brave like his brother.'

She added: 'Reece was a cracking lad, Holly was really fun and Ella was a bit of a softy.'Jordan? He was cool. At the moment I cannot see how the future will be, I am just living from day-to-day.

'At the moment I cannot say how I will remember them. Words cannot say what they meant to me.'

Speaking to The Sun, Reece's father, Martin, 48, said his son was extremely brave in attempting to rescue his siblings.

'He was very close to his brothers and sisters and thought the world of them,' he said.

'He thought about everybody else 
before himself and I am not surprised that he went back in to try and 
save them. I'm so proud of him.'

The fire broke out as the children's mother Michelle Smith was throwing a 36th birthday party at the home. The children died in an attic bedroom.

Yesterday Keith Smith, 56, the heartbroken grandfather of the four children, left a poetic tribute at the scene.

Poignant: The 56-year-old expressed his feelings in a poem

Mr Smith, father of the children's  mother Michelle, addressed his note to 'Reece, Jordan, Ella, Holly.'

His poem reads: 'The time here you really shone/ A short lives you had/ Now your gone [sic].

'All my love was there to keep/ My life is broken all I do is weep.'

He signs his message, in red marker pen, 'Grandad Smith, love you forever, till we meet again'.

His
tribute is propped against a white wooden fence placed outside the 
Lancashire home, on which someone has written: 'Please leave a message.'

Others have added: 'Your [sic] in my thoughts, sleep tight' and 'RIP'.

The wall is piled with flowers and teddy bears left by friends and family in tribute to the dead children.

Sobbing uncontrollably, Miss Smith returned to the converted bungalow on Sunday accompanied by police officers, after the four children 
were pronounced dead at hospital.

Clutching a picture of her twin girls, all she could say was: ‘I have lost the lights of my life... Where can I turn?’

Investigation continues: Police confirmed there was a birthday party at the house, which remained sealed off yesterday

The full-time mother had invited 
friends round for a party on Saturday night when the fire apparently 
started in a loft conversion where the twins were sleeping.

Revellers spilled out on to the 
pavement in panic, before dialling 999 shortly before 11.30pm.

Yesterday
other relatives described teenager Reece as a ‘hero’ after it emerged he went back 
inside the house to try to rescue the three children.

Miss Smith, who has three other 
daughters and two sons who live elsewhere, had also stayed in the home 
and had to be led to safety by firemen. She was unharmed.

Miss Smith’s father
said his blood ‘turned cold’ when he heard the story on the news early yesterday.

‘I rushed down here straight away, 
all the time wishing it wasn’t going to be true, but when I got here my 
worst nightmare came true,’ he said.

Outpouring: A teddy bear sits among piles of floral tributes outside the converted bungalow, with an envelope reading 'Angels' just visible. Other neighbours left notes expressing their sadness

‘I’m still trying to take it all in. They were smashing kids. The last time I saw them was at Christmas.'

They had moved into the house about two-and-a-half years ago and seemed very happy there. 

‘I’m still in shock. It is devastating news,’ he said.

Fighting back tears, he added: ‘It was 
Michelle’s birthday – I feel so sorry for her. They are cracking kids 
and she is a great mother.’

Police have begun an 
investigation into the tragedy and said they were keeping an ‘open mind’ as
to whether there were any suspicious circumstances.

Reports suggested the house had smoke alarms, but they were not working.

Miss Smith’s former partner, Colin 
Ostler, 42, said: ‘Michelle is in shock, she’s devastated, we all are, 
but it’s not really hit her yet. She’s too upset to talk about it, the 
enormity of what’s happened just hasn’t sunk in.’

Community in mourning: Tiny Ella, Jordan and Holly are believed to have only lived in the house for three months

'All hell broke loose': Neighbours said fire crews rushed to the scene where four of the Smith family lost their lives

Shocking: The twins' grandfather said he only heard of the tragedy on the news yesterday morning

Police and fire crews were confronted
with a ‘chaotic’ scene when they arrived, with many partygoers on the 
street in a distressed state.

Six firemen wearing breathing apparatus went inside the property and brought out the four children.

They were taken to the Royal Preston Hospital but declared dead.

Mr Ostler, who was in a relationship 
with Miss Smith for nine years and had three daughters, Bethany, 11, 
Jodie, ten, and Chloe, seven, with her, said Reece had died trying to save 
his siblings.

‘Reece died a hero,’ he said. ‘My 
three girls always stay with their mum on Friday nights and they wanted 
to stay on Saturday as well.

‘Thankfully, we said no and I took them home, otherwise who knows what could have happened.’ 

Mr Ostler, a part-time chef from 
Freckleton, added: ‘It is such a sad loss, it’s just horrendous, I can’t
get my head around it. Nobody should see their children die.’

Party: Police confirmed there was a gathering at the home which was attended by at least ten people

Big brother: Vibrant bouquets were adorned with messages to 'our best buddy and brother' Reece and a note from 'PippyJana and Grandad', saying the teenager would look after his siblings in heaven

Family friend Carolyn Milburn added: ‘It’s knocked us all for six. They were all lovely, all of them.

‘Lovely kids, well behaved, well brought up, always happy. Michelle is a good mum. She loves her kids.

‘I haven’t spoken to her yet but she and her mother, Christine, are both in a state.’

Detective Superintendent Andy Murphy, of Lancashire Police’s major investigation team, said they would be talking to a number of people who were at the house when the fire broke out.

‘We are keeping an open mind at this stage as to what happened,’ he added.

Tragic: Despite all four siblings being pulled from the home in Lytham Road, Freckleton, they were pronounced dead on arrival at the Royal Preston Hospital

Mourners: Friends and family left notes and gifts for each of the children individually
