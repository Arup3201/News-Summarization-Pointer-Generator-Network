Leeds owner Massimo Cellino wants Catania centre back Giuseppe Bellusci.

The 24-year-old has experience of playing in Serie A and Cellino sees him as the man to shore up Leeds' shaky defence.

But Stephen Warnock is free to leave Leeds despite having a year to run on his current contract.

The Championship club are also in talks over a deal for former Reading goalkeeper Stuart Taylor.

Elsewhere, Luke Varney has signed a one-year contract with Blackburn after being released from the Elland Road club.
