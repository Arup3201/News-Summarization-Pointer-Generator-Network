Terror plot: Texan Everett Adam Livvix, 30, was arrested in Israel last month for allegedly plotting to bomb Muslim holy sites 

A Texas man has been arrested and indicted in Israel on weapons charges for allegedly plotting to bomb Muslim holy
sites, 

The Israeli domestic security service Shin Bet and the Justice Ministry identified the suspect Tuesday as Adam Everett Livvix, 30, of Texas, and said he was wanted in the US on unrelated drug charges.  

Livvix, who was arrested November 19, was charged Monday
with conspiring with his roommate, an Israeli soldier, to steal 3lbs of explosives from the Israel Defense Forces.

The Israeli authorities said an undercover police agent uncovered the alleged terror plot and that ammunition and weapons
material stolen from the military were found in Livvix's possession.

A gag order on details of the case, being heard in a court
in the central Israeli city of Netanya, was lifted Tuesday.

'Under questioning, Livvix admitted ... he had weighed
various ideas about committing terrorist attacks at different
venues and even gave preliminary thought to the possibility of
attacking venues (of) Islamic holy places in Israel,' the Shin
Bet said, without identifying them.

The suspect's attorney told reporters that the Shin Bet was exaggerating the security implications of the case, which coincides with high Arab-Jewish tensions in Jerusalem over access to a holy site where the al-Aqsa mosque now stands in place of biblical Jewish holy sites. 

The Justice Ministry said the court has ordered Livvix to
undergo a psychiatric examination prior to entering a plea.

Israeli authorities said Livvix is a Christian and that he
arrived in the region in 2013, living first in the Palestinian
cities of Hebron and Bethlehem in the West Bank and
then residing illegally in the State of Israel.

According to Livvix's public arrest records, the 6-foot-tall, 200lbs man was wanted in Indiana for failure to appear in court on marijuana possession charges.

He was also named most wanted criminal in Crawford County, Illinois, in connection to failure to appear and theft charges.

The indictment against Livvix, made public Tuesday and cited by The Jerusalem Post, recounted how while living in the West Bank, the Texan was allegedly approached by a Palestinian operative who tried to recruit Livvix to assassinate President Barack Obama during his visit to the region last March.

Livvix was allegedly offered sniper rifles to carry out the plot on Obama's life, but he refused.

He then illegally crossed the border into Israel and settled in Netanya, where he passed himself off as a member of an elite Navy SEAL commando unit, the court documents stated. 

In mid-November, police were tipped off about Livvix's whereabouts, resulting in his arrest.

Assassination: Livvix was allegedly approached by a Palestinian in the West Bank last year about killing President Obama during his March visit, but the Texas man refused  

When officers kicked down the door to his apartment on November 19, Livvix attempted to flee by leaping from his seventh-floor window and landing on a sixth-floor balcony, but he was quickly apprehended.

During questioning, the American fugitive admitted to committing fraud and plotting to carry out terrorist attacks on Muslim holy sites.

When officers searched his apartment in Netanya, they allegedly discovered ammunition and spare gun parts stolen from the military.

According to his indictment, Livvix had encouraged his soldier friend to steal six stun grenades, smoke grenades and tear gas canisters from an IDF base.
