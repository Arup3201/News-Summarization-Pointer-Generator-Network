Blackburn Rovers manager Gary Bowyer has dismissed suggestions that striker Jordan Rhodes could leave.

Championship promotion hopefuls Derby County and Norwich are keen to take Rhodes on loan with view to a permanent £8million transfer should they go up. Nottingham Forest and Sheffield Wednesday are interested in a similar deal.

The 25-year-old Scotland international has scored 13 goals this season but has not been a regular starter and was on the bench for Sunday's 0-0 FA Cup quarter-final draw at Liverpool.

'I don't understand why we'd want to even consider loaning one of our players to rivals,' said Bowyer. 'I think it's come out of possibly that he wasn't involved in the starting 11 on Sunday.

'We've had plenty of chats, of course we have,' added Bowyer. 'But he's starting on Wednesday against Bolton and we're looking forward to him scoring like he did last week at Sheffield Wednesday.

'It's simple. We've got 11 league games left and a Cup quarter-final with a potential visit to Wembley.

'Why we would want to be letting any of our players go at this stage is beyond me.'

Blackburn, who are 14 points off sixth place, rejected a £12m proposal from Hull City last year but posted debts of £79.8m and are under a transfer embargo for failing to comply with FFP rules.
