The Trustee Savings Bank is making a comeback almost 20 years after it disappeared from the high street.

Lloyds – which merged with TSB in 1995 – plans to launch the branches in the summer after the Co-op pulled the plug on a £750million deal to buy 632 of its banks.

The Co-op yesterday said its change of heart was based on the ‘worsened outlook for economic growth’.

Pain: Lloyds was being forced to sell the branches because it received a 2008 bailout from the UK Government and after its Co-op deal collapsed it is turning to the TSB brand

But Lloyds insisted its exit from the 
deal will not affect the 4.6million branch customers of Lloyds and 
Cheltenham & Gloucester, which is part of the same group, who will 
now switch to TSB.

Coming back: The 636 branches up for sale are to be re-branded under the TSB symbol last used in 1995

This will give the new TSB Britain’s eighth largest 
network of bank branches.

The European Commission had ordered 
Lloyds to get rid of the branches by the end of this year as a condition
of receiving a £20billion bailout from taxpayers in 2008.

Now that the Co-op deal has fallen through, Lloyds intends to float  the revamped TSB brand on the Stock Exchange.

But this is unlikely to happen until 
next year at the earliest, so bosses will have to appeal to the European
Commission to extend the deadline for offloading the branches.

In the meantime, insiders concede that
TSB will effectively be an offshoot of Lloyds, with Lloyds current 
accounts, savings, mortgages and investments and staff, although 
chequebooks and credit cards will be branded with the TSB logo.

Once TSB is floated, it will stand 
alone and compete with Lloyds and other lenders.

Lloyds, which is 39 per
cent owned by the taxpayer, has seen its reputation plummet after being
rescued by taxpayers during the financial crisis and setting aside 
£6.7billion to pay customers mis-sold payment protection insurance.

Experts welcomed the relaunch of TSB but expressed dismay at the collapse of the Co-op deal.

There were also concerns that TSB would only really be a mini-Lloyds until its flotation.

Ministers had hoped the Co-op’s 
purchase of the branches would create a big, independent competitor to 
the main high street banks.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said: 
‘It is very disappointing. I was really hoping this would happen. We 
need more competition and we need more diversity in business lending, 
and having the Co-op, a mutual, a new player in small business lending, 
would have been a big step forward.’

Barclays Bank said yesterday its first-quarter profit fell a quarter from a year ago after a rise in losses in its European business and a hefty bill for the cost of a restructuring plan by its new chief executive.

The London-based giant reported an adjusted pre-tax profit for the three months ended March of £1.79bn down from 2.4bn.

It had hoped to make slightly more - £1.85bn.

Profits were dented by a £514m charge to cover costs associated with 'Project Transform', CEO Antony Jenkins' plan to axe 3,700 jobs, prune the investment bank and reform the bank's culture after a series of scandals.

Mr Jenkins said yesterday the bank was making good early progress with its overhaul.

'In our goal to become the 'Go-To' bank we have not chosen an easy path for Barclays, but we have chosen the right one,' he said.

Consumer campaigner Richard Lloyd, 
executive director of Which?, said: ‘This is very bad news for everyone 
wanting to see more competition in retail banking.

‘This would have given more choice to 
consumers who are sick and tired of shoddy service and unfair fees and 
put more pressure on the big banks to work for customers, not bankers.’

TSB grew from humble beginnings to 
become a major player on the high street, famous for its slogan, ‘The 
bank that likes to say Yes’.

The first trustee savings bank was 
established in 1810 by Reverend Henry Duncan, of Ruthwell in 
Dumfriesshire, so his poorest parishioners could save for times of 
hardship. The model was soon copied elsewhere and by 1817 more than 80 
had been set up across the UK.

Unlike other banks, their customers 
included labourers and servants – termed the ‘industrious poor’ – as 
well as women and children. After being amalgamated into regional 
institutions, they united in 1986, floating on the stock exchange to 
form TSB.

The new TSB will be run by Paul Pester, a former competitive swimmer who joined Lloyds in 2010.
