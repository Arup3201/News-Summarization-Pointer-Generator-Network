This is the touching moment a Kentucky police officer grabbed the hand of a woman who was struggling during a 10k race and helped her cross the finish line.

Asia Ford was celebrating her 200lb weight loss by participating in the Rodes City Run in Louisville. But after hitting the fourth mile, she became dizzy and found it hard to breathe.

Ford wrote on her Facebook that she had forgotten to eat that morning and was still recovering from a bout of pneumonia. 

But when paramedics checked on the mother-of-three she said there was no way she was going to quit. Her motivation inspired Lt Aubrey Gregory, who was working the race nearby.

Asia Ford was struggling after the fourth mile of the Rodes City Run in Louisville, Kentucky but refused to stop. Lt Aubrey Gregory was inspired by her motivation and decided he had to make sure she finished

He said he had to 'meet this inspirational woman' and got out and grabbed her hand. Gregory shared stories of his late mother to keep Ford's mind off the pain as they walked the last two miles with her son to the finish line 

Gregory, who works with the Louisville Metro Police Department, decided he was going to make sure Ford crossed that finish line. 

'I said I'm not going to let her stop, we're going to do this together,' he told WAVE 3. 'So I got out and I grabbed her hand.I had to meet this inspirational woman.' 

Gregory kept Ford's mind off the pain for the final two miles and shared stories about his late mother, who had diabetes.

And although Ford was long behind the rest of the pack and last in the race, Gregory called ahead to make sure there would be a finish line  waiting for them, he told Fox News. 

Soon the pair, who were joined by Ford's son Terrance, heard the crowd cheer. Gregory said it gave him goosebumps.

'I let her go right there before the end,' he told WHAS 11. 

'To see her raise her hands, there aren't words to express the way I felt seeing her be successful.'

Ford shared photos of her incredible weight loss journey where, at her heaviest, she weighed 474 pounds. Ford decided to get healthy so that she could be there for her three children 

Ford told WAVE 3 Gregory was her 'angel', who came at the moment she 'really needed him'. She added that he was an 'inspiration' for not letting her give up when she felt she couldn't continue.

Terrance Ford said that he was glad to see there were police officers like Gregory still around. 

'With all the stuff that's going on with police, it's just nice to know there are nice people out there,' he said. 

But it's his mother who Terrance said inspires  and motivates him to 'push harder' to do what he wants in life.

At her heaviest, Ford weighed 474 pounds. 

She had struggled with her weight for years but, when her then-husband lost a limb from diabetes, Ford knew she had to make a change for her children.

'That is when I woke up,' she told WHAS 11. 'I couldn't allow them to be on this earth without my help.'

'And the only way I would be able to help them is if I helped myself first.'
