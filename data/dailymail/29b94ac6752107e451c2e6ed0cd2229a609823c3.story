Rudy Gestede pulled out of Blackburn’s game with Wigan on Saturday in a bid to push through a move to Crystal Palace.

The 26-year-old told coaching staff that he was not in the right frame of mind to play after a week of interest from Premier League clubs.

Hull City and West Brom have both declared they are out of any prospective deal as they believe the Benin international is over-priced at £6million.

However, Palace are willing to offer around £5m for a player who has scored 12 goals this season and that may be enough to clinch a deal.

Meanwhile, Eagles scouts scouts watched Watford winger Ikechi Anya and striker Troy Deeney in Saturday’s 5-0 victory over Charlton.

Hornets winger Lloyd Dyer has gone to Birmingham on loan until the end of the season.
