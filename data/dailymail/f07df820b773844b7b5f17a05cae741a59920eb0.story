Cowboy: Builder Martin Bennison, 53, smiles as he leaves Teesside Crown Court after being sentenced to 300 hours unpaid work

A cowboy builder charged a doctor £37,318  for worthless work so he could prop up his failing business.

Martin Bennison, 53, took the money from Dr Jitendra during a refurbishment planned especially for his daughter's Indian wedding.

But the builder flooded the doctor’s Wolviston home, botching a bathroom plumbing job while guests were staying in neighbouring rooms

A judge at Teeside Crown Court ordered ex-bankrupt Bennison to carry out 300 hours’ unpaid work after admitting eight unfair trading offences.

Dr Patel, 67, said outside court: 'He got away lightly.'

Bennison, 53, was a friend trusted by Dr Patel after building his home and doing work at his Seaton Carew surgery to his satisfaction.

He was asked to build an extension, refurbish a bathroom and other works by mid-April last year, in time for Dr Patel’s daughter’s wedding.

He charged tens of thousands of pounds, plus VAT, for the home improvements.

He took a 50 per cent deposit of £23,570 for materials, assuring the family his high quotes were for a 'high specification job'.

After starting work a week late, he little improvement was made and the increasingly desperate Patels struggled to contact him.

When they found him, he promised: 'Without doubt, Doctor, I will complete the job by April 15, 2012.'

He took another £13,748, which he claimed was needed to get the job moving again.

But two days earlier, unknown to the Patels, his company had been dissolved.

Dr Patel had to pay £1,600 to repair damage caused by Bennison, including the major water leak.

He had to use industrial dehumidifiers in the home for three months.

His son also had to pay more than £5,000 to a builders’ merchant for materials which Bennison didn’t deliver.

When challenged, Bennison couldn’t explain where the family’s money had gone. He downed tools in June last year, leaving barely any work done and having failed to pay a electrician, tiler, painter and decorator.

Prosecutor Richard Bennett said: 'The work undertaken was really worthless.

'In short, the family had paid £37,318 for labour and materials for little if any value at all.'

Shoddy: Work done by Bennison around pipework in the Patel's home

Unfinished: Bennison did not complete the work in one of the Patel's showers

Sloppy: Bennison took £37,318 from Dr Jitendra Patel for the work, which included this effort on the flooring

A surveyor said the work, if done properly, was worth just £8,000, but the family would have to spend that sum just to put right what had gone wrong.

Ian Mullarkey, defending, said the married dad had a good work record for more than 30 years, but was in a desperate situation at the time through 'the most dire' financial and personal circumstances.

He said Bennison showed fremorse and deep regret, now lived with his daughter but was still in the same line of work and would like to repay the money.

The judge, Recorder Tim Gittins, told
Bennison: 'One can only imagine the stress and inconvenience that you 
were causing to Dr Patel and his family in the run-up to what should 
have been an enjoyable event, namely a family wedding.

'You’ve cost them £38,000 or more in payments to you. That, I have no doubt, was swallowed up in your business.

Mess: The cowboy builder left holes in the wall and bits of tile scattered all over the floor

Wall: Most of the work, including this plumbing behind the bathroom, was left unfinished

'I accept that this wasn’t from the outset deliberate behaviour on your part. You were seeking to keep a business afloat.

He said Bennison had built up a 'creditable business' before it was hit by the economic crash and he was made bankrupt.

The judge said he 'richly deserved' a prison sentence, but suspended the six-month term for two years for his family’s sake and in the hope of compensation for the Patels under the Proceeds of Crime Act.

After sentencing, Dr Patel said: 'It’s been disheartening to go through anything like this with an ex-friend, an old friend.

'I had no choice but to go through this process. He didn’t give me any choice because of his arrogance. It’s been very, very stressful.'

His son, 32-year-old accountant Yaomi Patel, said: 'He gets that sentence, it’s not right. I don’t think it’s fair. We never wanted it to come to this.

'My dad gave him plenty of opportunities to finish the job. It was like talking to a brick wall.'
