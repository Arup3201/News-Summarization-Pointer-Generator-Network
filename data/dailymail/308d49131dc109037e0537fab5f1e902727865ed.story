More trouble: Andrew Nisbet, 32, arrested
 last December for sexually abusing at least two boys while working as a golf 
instructor in Livermore, California, is now facing solicitation for murder charges 

A popular California youth golf coach charged with molesting three of his male students has attempted to hire a hit man from behind bars to kill at least two of the victims, officials said.

According to an affidavit, Andrew Nisbet, 32, wrote letters from his cell in Santa Rita Jail in Dublin talking about having two young men 'taken care of.'

Nisbet's letters containing information about the alleged victims eventually wound up in the hands of a confidential informant, who told about them to a sheriff's deputy in February.

Alameda County district attorney's Inspector Jeff McCort wrote in the affidavit that Nisbet penned additional letters to the informant acting as an intermediary agreeing on a price for each hit.

Last month, an undercover district attorney's inspector visited Nisbet in jail posing as a gun-for-hire and secretly recorded their conversation.

The agent described himself to Nisbet as a 'mechanic and said he could fix a car for him and made a pistol-shooting motion with his hand,' the affidavit cited by San Francisco Chronicle stated.

The suspected pedophile replied by saying that there were two 'cars' that were in need of fixing in Pleasanton and Santa Barbara.

According to officials, one of Nisbet's alleged molestation victims attends college in Santa Barbara.

The bogus assassin then asked Nisbet to name the Santa Barbara resident, and the former golf coach mouthed the name, adding that the 'car' was 21 years old, McCort wrote in the court document.

Instructor: Nisbet had tutored students at Las Positas Golf Course in Livermore since 2006 and was arrested in December 2013

III as his students pass their time in an airport playing cards as seen 
on his Facebook page

The Livermore coach also allegedly suggested to the undercover officer that he should steal the victims' cell phones to make the hits look like robberies.

Nisbet then allegedly offered to pay for the hits up front to prove to the 'mechanic' that he was serious.

When officials searched Nisbet's cell a week later, they discovered driving directions to the home of the victim from Pleasanton and a heap of letters written by the suspect to the informant discussing the alleged assassination plot.

In additional to the 75 felony counts he had been charged with in connection to the child sex abuse, Nisbet now also faces three counts of solicitation of murder. He is due back in court June 10.

Nisbet, who is married, had tutored students at Las Positas Golf Course in Livermore since 2006 and was arrested in December 2013 - a day before he was due to receive a PGA award for Coach of the Year at the prestigious Contra Costa Country Club.

According to a criminal complaint, Nisbet, who also operated the GRIP Junior Golf Academy, is accused of performing oral sex on his victims - some as young as 12 - in his car from December 2009 through March 2012 and showing them pornography on his phone - including child pornorgrpay. .

The complaint also alleges that other sex acts were committed by Nisbet in the golf clubs parking lot and during out-of-town golfing excursions.

Livermore police officer Steve Goard said that authorities became aware of the allegations when one of Nisbet's golf students reported that he was abused last November.

Las Positas Golf Course has announced Nisbet has been fired since his arrest.

'He befriended them as the cool coach, gave them rides to and from practice and bought them gifts, including top-of-the-line golf equipment,' Goard said to the San Jose Mercury News.

'He created a coach-athlete bond and, as he did, was figuring out who he could get away with it with.'

Nisbet was taken into custody at 10am December 7, 2013, on the golf course while he was working. During his initial interview, police said he admitted some lewd acts with the children.

His wife of two years, Kimberly Patrick Nisbet, has not commented on the allegations and appears to have moved out of the family home in Livermore, which is next door to Jackson Elementary School.
