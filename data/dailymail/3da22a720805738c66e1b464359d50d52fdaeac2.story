Reggie Love got an eyewitness account to history working as then-Senator Barack Obama's body man during his 2008 presidential campaign.

And now, the man who Obama himself calls his 'little brother', is revealing inside stories from his days working as the right hand man to one of the most powerful, and closely-guarded, men in the world - shortly before the release of his upcoming memoir, Power Forward: My Presidential Education.

The book details everything from how he introduced his boss to the music of Jay Z and President Obama's collection of good-luck charms to the Hillary Clinton meltdown during the Democratic primary that left Obama positive he would secure the party's nomination.

One section of the book, Power Forward, My Presidential Education (right) details the moment Hillary Clinton (left) 'unraveled' following a talk with Obama

'I was his DJ, his Kindle, his travel agent, his valet, his daughters' basketball coach, his messenger, his punching bag, his alarm clock, his vending machine, his chief of stuff, his note passer, his spades partner, his party planner, his workout partner, his caterer, his small forward, his buffer, his gatekeeper, his surrogate son, and ultimately, improbably, luckily, his friend,' he writes.

'I carried snacks and the luggage, babysat for the children of world leaders, prepped the teleprompter and the operator, and handled a million other tasks that came up on the fly.'

No story is more shocking however that the one Love tells of the moment Hillary Clinton 'unraveled' during a talk with Obama on the airport tarmac at Reagan National Airport.

In December 2007, at the height of the Democratic primary, Billy Shaheen, co-chair of Clinton's New Hampshire campaign, went on the record in an interview saying that Obama could never win the presidency as his admissions to drug use in his youth would open the door to let his Republican candidate slaughter him, and possibly even label him a drug dealer.

On this day, Clinton and Obama were both on their private jets parked next to one another on the tarmac when Clinton offered Obama an apology for what had happened.

Love writes: '"I want to apologize for the whole Shaheen thing,” she said. “I want you to know I had nothing to do with it.” 

'The candidate very respectfully told her the apology was kind, but largely meaningless, given the emails it was rumored her camp had been sending out labeling him as a Muslim. 

'Before he could finish his sentence, she exploded on Obama. In a matter of seconds, she went from composed to furious.

' It had not been Obama’s intention to upset her, but he wasn’t going to play the fool either. To all of us watching the spat unfold, it was an obvious turning point in our campaign, and we knew it.'

'He knew he was going to win the nomination after that moment on the tarmac, because Clinton had unraveled,' said Love of his former boss in an interview with The Des Moines Register.

And while Clinton did not seem to be the source of much joy for Obama on the campaign trail, there is one thing the man was sure to save wherever he went - good luck charms.

'Everything from military badges to poker chips to special rocks to handmade dream catchers,' explains Love.

And while most would do little to hold on to these trinkets, Obama keeps them in the White House Treaty Room, viewing them as pieces of 'silent encouragement' from the public.

Love also claims that he introduced President Obama to the music of Jay Z (above with Bruce Springsteen)

Most importantly however, Love, the self-proclaimed only 'brother' in the White House, reveals that the relationship between Jay Z and President Obama all began when he introduced his boss to the rapper's music. 

He also details Obama's routine and needs - in particular his must-have: Nicorette, normal flavor, two milligrams.

Also on the list of things he needed through the day were Dentyne Ice, his preferred gum, MET-Rx Protein Plus, a meal replacement bar, and strict instructions on food: no salads while traveling in a vehicle, silverware, napkins, water and green tea.

Love discloses that Obama's typical breakfast on the campaign trail was eggs, wheat toast and bacon.

He was responsible for his lunch as well, usually consisting of grilled fish or grilled chicken. 

The would-be president liked a ranch dressing or vinaigrette, sandwiches and Gala apples.

'Mealtime was his only reprieve from the stress of the day,' Love writes.

The other - perhaps partial - reprieve was exercise. 

He had to workout on a treadmill for no less than an hour. He often lost sight of time so Reggie had to be nearby to watch the clock and call time to him.

He used seventy-pound dumbbells, a squat rack or adjustable benches.

They also played - and talked - basketball. On primary days, they played pickup games when it was against the rules for a candidate to show up at a precinct.

Obama didn't want anyone to be soft on him. Games slowed down after the election when the President took an elbow in the lip from another player that required a dozen stitches.

Michelle reminded him, 'You aren't twenty years old.'

The two men coached Sasha's team of nine and ten year old girlfriends on how to pick and roll. The girls giggled hysterically through the sessions.

 Love began his career with Obama's communications office in 2006, shortly after graduating from Duke University where the political science and public policy major balanced school with positions on not just one, but two college teams.

Love was a forward for the Blue Devils on the basketball court and a wide receiver on the football field, an athletic feat made even more impressive by the fact that he was part of the 2001 team that clinched the NCAA tournament.

He left his job in 2011, and is currently getting his Master's Degree at the University of Pennsylvania.
