The leader of Hizb ut-Tahrir Australia has refused to condemn the brutal attacks at the Charlie Hebdo offices this week, claiming his response should be a cause for celebration, not condemnation.

In a statement released to the media, entitled We Will Not Abandon Our Prophet, the Hizb ut- Tahrir leader, Ismail Alwahwah, said the group's refusal to 'succumb to the woeful moral ambivalence of the West' should be seen as good news for Muslims, who must resist the vile and racist views of many European powers.

He said the political response to the massacre in Paris was unprecedented and disproportionate when compared with how many lose their lives everyday. He also claimed that some political leaders have used the terrorist attacks for their own agenda.

Uthman Badar, Hizb ut-Tahrir’s spokesperson, took said Muslims should ignore publications such as Charlie Hebdo

The group believes the world's political leaders are using the barbaric event for their own political gain 

Hizb ut-Tahrir is an Islamic political party which advocates for the establishment of a global caliphate. 

'The biggest criminals of the world like Obama and Netanyahu are already seeking to exploit the events of last week for their predictable but nefarious purposes, despite the dust not settling and facts yet to be confirmed,' he said.  

While most Australian Muslims leader in Australia have criticised the massacre Hizb ut-Tahrir said Muslims 'do not need to be lectured about the sanctity of human life' and the political response shows a 'callous and calculated exploitation' to the recent attacks. 

The group previously supported Sydney siege hostage taker Man Haron Monis

In a Facebook post, Hizb ut- Tahrir's media representative br Uthman Badar claims Muslims should ignore provocative publications such as French magazine Charlie Hebdo and scholars and activists seeking to ridicule The Prophet.

'We should not fall for the provocative and bullying tactics of magazines like Charlie Hebdo and engage in vigilante style attacks. They are wrong, unwise and counterproductive. They fall into the trap of being used to further demonise Islam and justify draconian policies and an unjust foreign policy,' he said. 

The radical Islamic group had also previously supported Sydney siege hostage taker Man Haron Monis after he was convicted of sending hate letters to the families of dead soldiers.

Uthman Badar agrivated many with his appearance on Lateline and his refusal to condemn the Islamic State

The group has refused to condemn the terrorist attacks on Paris this week 

Uthman Badar, was embroiled in controversy earlier this year when he planned to give a talk at Sydney's Festival of Dangerous Ideas titled Honour Killings Are Morally Justified.

Mr Badar's speech was cancelled after a public outcry. 

The group also came under fire after appearing on Australian TV show Lateline, refusing to condemn the Islamic State's murderous campaign and lambasting US military presence in Iraq.  

Elomar, who is wanted by the Australian Federal Police for his activities in the Middle East

In early August a gruesome photo of a young boy, believed to be Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf's son, holding a severed head was posted on a Twitter account.

 His friend Mohamed Elomar, a former Australian boxer, was also pictured grinning widely as he posed with two decapitated heads. He then appeared in a video handing out advice on how to access deadly explosives in Sydney.

In July, Sharrouf posted a picture of a child brandishing an assault rifle and issued a call-to-arms for other Australian Muslims to join Islamic State's bloody war in the Middle East as well as posting a photo on Twitter of a young child brandishing a rifle. 

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Hizb ut-Tahrir for comment.
