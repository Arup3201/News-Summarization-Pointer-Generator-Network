Superbowl Champ Warren Sapp has sold his palatial home in Windermere Florida for $2.1 million to a fitness celebrity who made her fortune with workout videos.

Brenda Dykgraaf was the high bidder at the Thursday’s auction of Sapp’s estate, according to Fisher Auction.

‘[It was] strictly a real estate deal,’ Dykgraaf told reporters. ‘I live in Wesley Snipes’ old home right next to where Tiger Woods used to live so it doesn’t really matter to me.’

Busted: Sapp lost most of his money in an investment to build low-income housing before the real estate market crashed

No stranger to profiting from the poor business acumen of celebrities, Dykgraaf bought Snipe’s house just before he went to federal prison for tax evasion.

Dykgraaf said she wouldn’t live in the house but might use Sapp’s celebrity to market it.

Dygraaf, 51, is the star of several home exercise videos including Disco Workout and Whole Body Workout and has sold fitness equipment for the Home Shopping Network including the AirClimber and Ab Roller Plus.

Luxury home: Sapp's 10,000 square foot estate was built for appromixmately $7 million just seven years ago but only sold for $2.1 million this week

Built in 2005 for $7 million, the 10,000 square foot Tuscan style home is filled with luxuries.

There are four large bedrooms, a wine cellar, a private movie theater, and a custom resort-style swimming pool complete with waterside and lazy river.

Dykgraaf was one of five registered bidders who eposited $300,000 in cash each for the chance to bid for Sapp’s home with the initial asking price set at $1.6 million.

Sapp¿s home is rumored to still house a pair of Mohammed Ali¿s boxing gloves and more than 200 pairs of Nike Air Jordan¿s the former NFL star collected

The auction lasted only 15 minutes before Dykgraaf’s bid wasn’t matched.

‘You always hope for more bidders,’ said Lamar Fisher, owner of the Pompeo Beach auction company.

A deal: Dykgraaf said she wouldn¿t live in the house but had purchased it strictly as a real estate deal

Sapp, a former Tampa Bay Buccaneers stay who played in the National Football League for 13 seasons told the Tampa Tribune that he had to file for bankruptcy to avoid jail time.

Last resort: Sapp said he wouldn¿t have declared bankruptcy or sold the beautiful Tuscon home if there was another way to stay out of prison

‘Do you think I wanted to declare bankruptcy?’ he said to reporters. ‘Do you think, if there was any other way possible, I would have done it? It was either this or go to jail.’

Sapp lost much of his money in a plan to build a low-income housing project in Fort Pierce, but the market dropped out after he invested in the deal leading to his NFL wages being garnished for 11 months as his bills went unpaid.
