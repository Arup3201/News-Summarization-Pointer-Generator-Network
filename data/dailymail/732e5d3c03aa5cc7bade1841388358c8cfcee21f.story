Sleep boosts the production of brain support cells, new research has revealed.

Scientists found sleep increases the reproduction of cells that form the insulating material known as myelin, which is essential for the brain to function properly.

The findings could one day lead scientists to new insights about sleepâ€™s role in brain repair and growth and a new understanding about multiple sclerosis, a disease that damages myelin.

Sleep boosts the production of brain cells necessary for it to function properly, new study finds

Researchers have known for years that many genes are turned on during sleep and off during periods of wakefulness.

However, it was unclear how sleep affects specific cells types, such as oligodendrocytes, which make myelin in the healthy brain and in response to injury.

Much like the insulation around an electrical wire, myelin allows electrical impulses to move rapidly from one cell to the next.

Doctor Chiara Cirelli and colleagues at the University of Wisconsin in the United States measured gene activity in oligodendrocytes from mice that slept or were forced to stay awake.

They found that genes promoting myelin formation were turned on during sleep.

In contrast, the genes implicated in cell death and the cellular stress response were turned on when the animals stayed awake.

Dr Cirelli speculated the findings, 
published in the Journal of Neuroscience, suggest that extreme and/or 
chronic sleep loss could possibly aggravate some symptoms of multiple 
sclerosis (MS).

She said 
that future experiments may examine whether or not an association 
between sleep patterns and severity of MS symptoms exists.

Additional analysis revealed that the reproduction of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) - cells that become oligodendrocytes - doubles during sleep, particularly during rapid eye movement (REM), which is associated with dreaming.

Dr Cirelli said: 'For a long time, sleep researchers focused on how the activity of nerve cells differs when animals are awake versus when they are asleep.

'Now it is clear that the way other supporting cells in the nervous system operate also changes significantly depending on whether the animal is asleep or awake.'

Doctor Mehdi Tafti, who studies sleep at 
the University of Lausanne in Switzerland but was not involved in the 
study, said: 'These findings hint at how sleep or lack of sleep might 
repair or damage the brain.'
