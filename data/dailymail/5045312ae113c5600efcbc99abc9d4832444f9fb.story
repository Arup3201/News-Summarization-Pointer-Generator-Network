Gay marriage advocates waved rainbow flags outside the Supreme Court today to celebrate the striking down of DOMA - but elsewhere in Washington there was another, more subtle show of support.

The 12-year-old daughter of President Obama gave her own seal of approval to the ruling with a rainbow tote on her arm as she left the White House with her family to embark on the first leg of their African tour.

Obama has in the past credited his daughters for contributing to his about turn on gay marriage, saying they prompted a 'change in perspective'.

When announcing in May 2012 that he had had a change of heart on the issue, he said: 
'There have been times where Michelle and I have been sitting around the
dinner table and we're talking about their friends and their parents, 
and Malia and Sasha, it wouldn't dawn on them that somehow their 
friends' parents would be treated differently.

'It doesn't make sense to them and frankly, that's the kind of thing that prompts a change in perspective.'

Weighing in: President Obama is on a state visit to Africa and said he was happy about the ruling

The President made his own feelings over the landmark decision known as he tweeted the new ruling was 'a historic step forward for 
#MarriageEquality'.

In what was another historic moment, the First family today embarked upon an eight-day trip to Africa aimed at reviving U.S. engagement with the continent, although that will be overshadowed by the uncertain health of South Africa hero Nelson Mandela.

Unity: President Obama travelled with wife Michelle, daughters Malia and Sasha, Michelle's mother Marian Robinson and niece Leslie Robinson

Obama's trip, his second to the continent as president, will take him to Senegal, South Africa and Tanzania. While the president hopes to spotlight trade and economic development themes, his visit would be dwarfed if Mandela's condition takes a turn for the worse.

The 94-year old former South African president remained hospitalized in critical condition after being admitted more than two weeks ago with a lung infection, the government said on Tuesday.

Air Force One carried Obama, his wife Michelle, their daughters Sasha and Malia, as well as the first lady's mother, Marian Robinson, and an Obama niece, Leslie Robinson.

Africans feel a special bond with Obama, the first African American U.S. president, and have been impatient for him to make an extended visit to the continent. Africans are also disappointed that the Obama administration has not engaged with the continent as much as the administrations of George W. Bush and Bill Clinton.

Equality: Michelle Obama has also spoken out in favour of gay marriage, saying: 'In a country where we teach our children that everyone is equal under the law, discriminating against same-sex couples just isn't right'

Influence: Obama credits his daughters Malia, left, and Sasha with helping change his perspective on gay marriage

Administration officials say the trip is an opportunity to jump-start the relationship. Obama's first stop will be Senegal, where he will visit Goree Island, the site of a monument to Africans who were sent to slavery in the Americas.

His next stop will be in South Africa, where aides say he will be available to visit Mandela but will defer to the wishes of the Mandela family to determine whether the former South African leader is up to such an encounter.

In South Africa, Obama is due to make a speech outlining his Africa policy at the University of Cape Town, where Robert F. Kennedy gave his famous 1966 address comparing the struggle against apartheid in South Africa with the struggle for civil rights in the United States.

The president will also visit Robben Island, where Mandela and other political prisoners were held, and visit a health clinic.

Obama's last stop will be in the East African nation of Tanzania, where he will take part in events with business leaders and visit a power plant.

But while most in the continent eagerly anticipated the visit, there were some who expressed concern over the impact the Obamas' visit might have on the city's industry.

Welcome: Preparations were underway in Dakar, Senegal where flags had been hung in anticipation of the First family's arrival

The Africa Review reported that the 
people of Senegal were 'drawing lessons from the past' and 'leaving 
nothing to chance' after previous high profile visits led to a fall in 
profitability.

They recall business in Dakar taking a
severe blow during other high profile visits - including when former 
U.S. president Bill Clinton visited the Senegalese capital. 

Locals endured long traffic jams 
while distinguished guests passed through, loss of sales when prevented 
from selling their wares in the street and complained of being 'held 
prisoner' in their houses.

Bunkered in: Some locals are concerned the circus surrounding the presidential visit could have a negative impact on business in the capital. One economist predicts losses of several million dollars

They say businesses, particularly in 
downtown Dakar and surrounding areas, have already started recording low
sales due to this anticipation.

Mbaye
Ndiaye, an economist formerly employed by the Trade ministry, says the 
visit will 'cause losses of several million dollars, especially to the 
informal sector [hawkers, sex workers] who will take months to recover'.

'While the Americans are capable of 
making our country a better place, Obama is also capable of making our 
small businesses in Dakar poorer,' doughnut and coffee seller Ndeye Diop
added.

Elsewhere, some have criticised Obama for the soaring cost of the tour, which could reportedly reach $100m. Some scoffed when a safari was vetoed after it was revealed the president would have required Secret Service agents to act as snipers in case of a wild animal attack.

Further controversy surrounded Obama's decision to bring his mother-in-law Marian Robinson and her daughter and Obama's niece Leslie on the trip, which the White House Dossier says detractors have said makes it a 'de facto vacation'.

The trip could be among the most expensive journeys a president has taken in recent memory, with price forecasts ranging between $60 million and $100 million. His recent appearances in Israel cost taxpayers an estimated $10.9 million.

Trips on Air Force One cost the government about $180,000 per flight hour.

The White House scotched a plan to include a Tanzanian safari on the agenda after a reporter revealed that a team of snipers with high-powered military assault rifles would accompany him in the wild.

The Washington Post reported that the itinerary's dangers 'would have required the president’s special counterassault team to carry sniper rifles with high-caliber rounds that could neutralize cheetahs, lions or other animals if they became a threat.'

The newspaper based its report on a confidential planning document leaked from someone in the administration.
