Two associates of former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez were indicted Friday on murder charges in the shooting death last summer of Odin Lloyd.

A grand jury in Bristol County indicted both Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace in the June 2013 killing of semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd, District Attorney C. Samuel Sutter said, and their lawyers are blasting the moves.

Ortiz and Wallace, who are from Bristol, Conn., where Hernandez grew up, had previously been charged with accessory to murder after the fact and pleaded not guilty. They had been ordered held on $500,000 bail on the older charges and remained in custody.

Charged: Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz

'Ernest Wallace did not shoot or kill anyone,' lawyer David Meier told the Boston Globe in his client's defense. 'he nature and timing of this new charge against Mr. Wallace speaks for itself.

'One can only ask, is it based on the facts and the law, or something else? Ernest Wallace looks forward to confronting his accusers in a court of law.'

Ortiz's lawyer, John Connors, said he had
 not seen the indictment but called it 'totally ridiculous.' He said, as
 he had in the past, that Ortiz was 'just along for the ride' with 
Hernandez, Wallace and Lloyd on the night Lloyd was killed.

'We started out having a gun [charge], then accessory after the fact [of murder], and now we’re up to first-degree murder,' Connors told the Globe. 'This is absolutely crazy.'

Connors insisted the district attorney's office has strung his client along, charging him first with a weapons violation, then accusing him of being an accessory.

'It almost looks to me like they felt 
they couldn't use him as a witness, (so) they're going to charge him?' 
he said. 'Why wouldn't they have done this months ago? There's no new 
evidence in this matter.'

Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to 
murder in the killing of Lloyd, a 27-year-old Boston resident who was 
dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins.

Jenkins, who testified before the grand jury, has been charged with perjury in the case.

Hernandez's
 cousin Tanya Singleton, who refused to testify, has been charged with 
criminal contempt and conspiracy to commit accessory after the fact. 
Both have pleaded not guilty.

Joint venture: Experts believe that charging both Ortiz and Wallace makes it easier to win a conviction against Hernandez because prosecutors no longer have to prove the former Patriot pulled the trigger - it only has to prove he was aware of the murder and did nothing to stop it or present when it happened

The
 district attorney's office said Friday that Ortiz and Wallace would be 
arraigned in Fall River Superior Court on the new charges at a date yet 
to be scheduled. The office said it would have no further comment on the
 indictments until then.

Questions have been raised about the 
reliability of Ortiz as a witness. Prosecutors say he has told 
authorities that he didn't see who shot Lloyd but that Hernandez and 
Lloyd were alone outside the car. That's different from his initial 
story, in which, according to court records, he told police that 
Hernandez and Wallace got out with Lloyd.

The Globe reported that these indictments allow the state to charge Hernandez, Ortiz and Wallace under the 'joint venture law.'

'Defendants can be convicted of murder if they were present at the time of a slaying, knew that a killing was about to take place, or aided or encouraged it in any way,' the paper explained.

Gerard T. Leone Jr., a former district attorney now working in private practice, told the Globe that the credibility of any testimony from Ortiz or Wallace can be called into question - but also that the indictments make it easier to win a murder conviction.

'It’s a much more difficult case to have Hernandez as the sole person charged with murder,' he said. 'You have no joint venture theory against people who are charged with different charges and not the murder.'

Another lawyer agreed, telling the Globe jurors 'might be puzzled as to why he’s the one holding the bag, if all three of them were together.'

Lloyd's bullet-riddled body was found by a jogger in an industrial park in North Attleborough. Prosecutors have said Hernandez was upset with Lloyd for talking at a nightclub to some people with whom he had problems. They have not identified who they believe pulled the trigger.

A message was left for Wallace's attorney, David Meier. Wallace has been described by prosecutors as Hernandez's 'right-hand man.'
