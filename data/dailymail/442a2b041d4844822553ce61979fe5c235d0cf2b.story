Admission: Mike Sorrentino has confirmed he is in rehab for addiction to prescription medication

'I have spent the past several weeks 
getting treatment for this problem and recuperating from my work and 
appearance schedule. I appreciate my fans support and love you guys.'

Mike is said to have hit rock bottom while filming the latest season of Jersey Shore.

Sources close to Sorrentino have told TMZ.com how he started to act more and more 'paranoid' as filming for Season 5 went on.

In a recently-aired episode on MTV, Mike was seen acting jittery and sweating profusely when the gang went camping.

Insiders told TMZ the crew are 'happy'
 he is now seeking treatment and hope he will be well enough to return 
to shoot the upcoming Sixth season of the show.

Yesterday the website reported how the 29-year-old has checked in to an inpatient treatment facility.

A source told the website that Mike ‘has spent the past several weeks at an undisclosed location for much needed rest and recuperation after his extensive production and appearance schedule’.

Today the website claims Mike has 
checked into Cirque Lodge in Utah, where Demi Moore was reported to have
 stayed, to seek treatment for addiction to prescription medication.

A spokesperson for the reality TV personality was unavailable for comment when contacted by MailOnline.

However a cryptic message was posted onto Mike's website that read: 'You can't believe everything you hear about 'the situation' with The Situation.'

A few hours later a post was uploaded confirming that he was seeking treatment.

Also today a video has emerged of Mike's father Frank Sorrentino talking about his son's first trip to rehab.

In the clip which was loaded to metacafe.com today Frank explains how Mike couldn't afford treatment and his older brother Mark paid for treatment.

And speaking about how he felt at the time Frank said: 'For me, after years of dealing with his addiction, years of dealing with all the bull***t, this wasn’t a 16-year-old kid. The guy was a 27-year-old man. I was just hoping he would be able to stand up.'

Earlier this week it emerged that Jersey Shore will return for a sixth season – despite the fact Nicole Snooki Polizzi is pregnant.

Mike
 found fame on the reality show in 2009 and has since enjoyed several TV
 appearances on chat shows as well as being paid to attend nightclubs 
and events.

While he is one of the most explosive and controversial characters on the show he has not secured his own spin off shows like Snooki and JWoww or Pauly D.

But while Mike is said to be in rehab
 there have still been a series of tweets posted to his social 
networking page that reveal he is getting in shape for the upcoming 
show.

One post today read: ‘Getting in amazing shape for season 6!’

In a statement about the sixth series of the show MTV said: 'While things will definitely be a little different this time when they hit the boardwalk, their trademark hilarity and family dysfunction will remain the same.'

The series will begin filming this summer in Seaside Heights, New Jersey.
