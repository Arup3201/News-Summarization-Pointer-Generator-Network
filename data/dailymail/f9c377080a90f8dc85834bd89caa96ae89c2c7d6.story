A deadly leopard stunned tourists by catching and then 'befriending' a frightened impala.

The big cat seemed to shelve its predator instincts as it played and licked the young fawn.

The rarely seen interaction was caught on camera by game ranger Chad Cocking, 29, in Kruger National Park, South Africa.

Cuddling up: The young leopard rests its paw on an impala in Kruger National Park, in what tourists thought might be an extraordinary show of friendship between predator and prey

Friend for dinner: This leopard seems to play affectionately with an impala in Kruger National Park... but the cordial relationship didn't last long

Mr Cocking said: 'This was clearly far more of a game for the leopard than it was for the impala - but some moments could almost have been misinterpreted as bonding between the two.'

Unfortunately the friendship was not to last and the leopard eventually got bored with its own game and ate the impala.

The cat was well-known to rangers as a newly independent hunter named Nkateko - meaning lucky.

Her mother had died from a severe infection caused by a wounded ear, which had actually been inflicted by Nkateko.

Strange bedfellows: Tourists at Kruger National Park, in South Africa were amazed when predator appear to befriend prey

Where do you think you're going! The impala realises this friendship may not last and attempts to make a bid for freedom only to be firmly held in place by the hungry leopard

Mr Cocking was with safari guests when they found the young female carrying a live baby impala in her jaws.

The 22-month-old leopard dropped the exhausted impala on the ground and waited for it to try and run away before pouncing on it again.

It would then repeat the game.

At one point the impala managed to escape by running underneath the tourists' Land Rover, where the leopard was too timid to approach.

Bid for freedom: The young impala, clearly showing the injuries from its struggle with the leopard, momentarily escapes the predator's clutches

Normal service resumed: The temporary truce is brought to a violent end in front of stunned tourists as the leopard again grabbs hold of the impala

Chad, from Johannesberg, said: 'I had to make a decision. It was not my role to interfere so I decided to reverse and the leopard moved in again to reclaim her prize.

'Whenever the impala got up to run off, some of the guests would cheer it on, hoping that it would run away to safety, but the leopard was too quick and agile for this ending to ever come to fruition.'

Mr Cocking said it was the first time he had seen this behaviour in his six years at the Motswari Private Game Lodge and more than 20 years visiting the area.

He added: 'It was a touch sad, as it is never a pleasing experience to watch an animal suffer, but at the same time it was a truly remarkable experience to watch this rare behaviour first-hand.'

In for the kill: The young leopard finally decides to carry the impala in its jaws off into the undergrowth of Kruger National Park to eat

Dinner time: The helpless impala lies motionless at the big cat prepares to devour its prey - all caught on camera by a tourist in Kruger National Park, South Africa
