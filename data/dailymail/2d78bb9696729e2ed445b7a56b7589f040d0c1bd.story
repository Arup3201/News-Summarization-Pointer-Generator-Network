Protest: Maria Alyokhina, pictured last year, has gone on a hunger strike after a court blocked her from attending her parole hearing

One of the two jailed members of Pussy Riot has gone on a hunger strike after being barred from her own parole hearing.

Maria Alyokhina, 24, says the court is violating her rights by not allowing her to take part in the hearing and told her lawyers to quit proceedings in Berezniki, in Perm Krai, central Russia.

Ms Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 23, are serving 
two-years terms for their 'punk prayer' protest in a Moscow cathedral in February last year.

Pussy Riot, a feminist 'punk-rock collective', entered Cathedral of Christ the Savior clad in colourful balaclavas and staged a performance singing a song urging the Virgin Mary to 'throw Putin out'.

Ms Alyokhina and Ms Tolokonnikova were arrested with a third member, Yekaterina Samutsevich, and held without bail for five months before their August trial.

All three were convicted, with Ms Samutsevich later released on probation.

Speaking by a video link from prison during proceedings on Wednesday, Ms Alyokhina told the court considering her request for release on parole that she is going on a hunger strike.

'In protest against the court's refusal to allow me to appear in person to take part in the hearing, I'm going on a hunger strike.

'In the current circumstances I forbid all my lawyers and representatives to take part in this court hearing.'

Following her statement, Alyokhina's lawyer  Irina Khrunova left the court, acting on her client's wishes. She said Alyokhina's decision was a method of last resort.

'She decided that only in this way, with the attention (brought by) a hunger strike, could she show how the rights of defendants are violated,' Ms Khrunova said.

'She made this decision soundly, independently, and after deliberation.'

Following Ms Alyokhina’s announcement yesterday, Sir Paul McCartney has written to Russian authorities asking them to consider her parole.

The former Beatle, who has previously expressed his support for the group, has asked officials to grant Ms Alyokhina the right to be present at a future hearing in several handwritten letters.

He said: ‘My personal belief is that further incarceration for Maria will be harmful for her and the situation as a whole, which, of course, is being watched by people all over the world.

‘In the great tradition of fair-mindedness which the Russian people (many of whom are my friends) are famous for, I believe that you granting this request would send a very positive message to all the people who have followed this case.’

In a further letter, regarding Ms Tolokonnikova, Sir Paul said: ‘I have had a long relationship with the Russian people, and, with this in mind, I am making the following request in a spirit of friendship for my many Russian acquaintances who, like me, believe in treating people - all people - with compassion and kindness.’

Ms Alyokhina's mother, Natalia, said 
she had little faith in Russian justice and would not raise her hopes of
her daughter's parole.

'I don't expect anything good from the judge. It will be hard,' she said.

According to documents read in court 
Ms Alyokhina's behaviour in prison may risk her parole. She is said to 
be rude to prison staff and to not respect sleeping hours.

The three Pussy Riot members were convicted of 'hooliganism motivated by religious hatred' last August, following a trial seen by their supporters as part of a clampdown on dissent by Putin during his third term in power.

Ms Samutsevich was released on parole in October 2012, while Ms Tolokonnikova, 23, was denied parole last month.

Both Ms Tolokonnikova and Ms Alyokhina both have young children, and have requested to have their sentences deferred until they are older.

Both requests have been rejected by courts and the pair are due for release next March.

In Ms Alyokhina's case, the judge at the court in Berezniki, located 620 miles northeast of Moscow, adjourned the parole hearing until Thursday afternoon.
