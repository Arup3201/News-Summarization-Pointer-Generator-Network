Police have released names and pictures of the two people who fled the scene of a fatal stabbing on Sunday night.

Luke Berg, 28 and Alicia Schiller, 25, are wanted for questioning over the death of Tyrelle Evertsen-Mostert, 31, who died following an argument with two lodgers at her home in Norlane, north of Geelong.

Officers have warned that the duo could be armed and are advising anyone who sees them to avoid approaching them and instead call police.

Ms Evertsen-Mostert, 31, was stabbed to death following an argument with two lodgers at her home in Norlane, north of Geelong, on Sunday night

'I am appealing for Luke and Alicia to come forward to us or make contact with us so we can speak to them about what occurred on Sunday evening,' homicide squad detective inspector Mick Hughes said. 

Mr Hughes said that the stabbing occurred following an argument between a number of people in the Geelong home.

'They went into the bedroom, there was a discussion in the bedroom, that escalated and the female we believe has been stabbed,' he told the ABC.

Police would not give a description or detail Luke and Alicia's involvement in the investigation, but said the group was known to each other.

The 31-year-old's mother said she called her moments after she had been stabbed on Sunday

'They were all in the house just prior to the assault,' Det Insp Hughes said.

'They went into the bedroom and there was a discussion in the bedroom that escalated.'

Police do not know what the argument was about.

The victim, a mother-of three who was stabbed while her four-year-old son was in the other room, made a final phone call to her mum as she lay dying inside her home.

Victorian homicide squad detectives are searching for a man and woman in their 20s who left the home in Norlane shortly after the incident

'Tyrelle got on the phone and said 'mum I can't do this any more.'  Johanna said.

'I got there and the ambulance crew were working on her, but I could see she was already gone.

'She had a big heart. Sometimes I would even say to her she has a halfway house because anyone that wanted to stay, she'd let them stay.'

Tributes have flown for the mother over social media, where friends have describe her as ' a beautiful woman with the biggest heart'.

Ms Evertsen-Mostert's partner, Jason, was also injured in the attack and was taken to hospital with minor injuries

'She was outgoing caring and full of love, she was well known for helping anyone who needed anything and always put a roof over people's heads even if she didn't know them. She gave everything to everyone and never asked in return.'

Two other men who were at the house at the time were questioned by police, but have been cleared as suspects.

Ms Evertsen-Mostert's partner, Jason, was also injured in the attack and was taken to hospital with minor injuries.
