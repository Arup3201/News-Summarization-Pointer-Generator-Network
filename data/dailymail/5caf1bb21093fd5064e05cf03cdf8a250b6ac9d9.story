A two-year-old girl was shot dead and her one-year-old brother wounded after a gunman fired bullets through the door of their South Atlanta home while they were sleeping.

Ty-Teyanna Motley was killed and her brother, Isaiah, suffered a gunshot wound close to his spine when the bullets were fired into the red-brick home around 1.40am on Saturday.

The children lay sleeping on a sofa with their grandmother when they were hit.

Police say 2-year-old Ty-Teyanna Motley, pictured, was fatally shot as she slept with her grandmother early Saturday. Her brother, 1-year-old, Isaiah, was wounded

Ty-Teyanna was rushed to Grady Memorial Hospital, where she was pronounced dead, while her brother was taken to Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston in critical condition, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

The victims’ uncle, Charlie Howard, was sleeping in the basement of the home when the shots were fired.

He said the boy suffered a bullet wound near his spine.

‘We never had any problems with anybody,’ said Howard. ‘Whoever did that was a coward. My niece was only two years old. If they had a problem, they should just tell us.’

Howard told the newspaper that the gunshots woke him up and that when he ran upstairs, he found his nephew screaming and covered in blood while his niece was unresponsive. The sofa where they had been sleeping was located a couple feet from the door.

The bullets entered the bottom part of the door and traveled through the back of the couch before they struck the children. At least two shots were fired. 

Police say they have no leads on who fired the shots.

‘We’re going to make it. We’re going to get to the bottom of this,’ Howard told the AJC. ‘I’m trying to hold it in, because crying isn’t going to bring them back.’
