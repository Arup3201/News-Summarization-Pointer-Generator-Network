Shot and killed: Tamir Rice, 12, who was holding an airsoft pistol in a park in Cleveland, Ohio

St Louis County Police is mired in fresh killer cop controversy after a post on the force's official facebook page appeared to blame a 12-year-old black boy for the police shooting that killed him.

Tamir Rice was playing with a toy gun when he was shot dead by a white officer in Cleveland last week.

The tragic incident further fueled the anger and protests that have raged in the wake first of a Grand Jury's failure to indict Ferguson officer Darren Wilson for the shooting of Michael Brown and, now, a second Grand Jury's failure to indict the NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo for his fatal chokehold arrest of Eric Garner.

Today, the St Louis force has been slammed for the posting titled, 'Kids will be Kids?' which warned parents, 'Your children should have rules for a toy gun that mirror the rules for a real gun.'

Weapon: Tamir Rice was captured on CCTV with an airsoft pistol which had no orange muzzle guard 

'Gun': The airsoft replica of a Colt handgun which was taken from Tamir Rice after he was shot 

Official account: This was the message posted by Officer Dilks on St Louis County Police's official Twitter today

lengthy: The Facebook posting by the officer which has now been deleted. It said was not about 'whether it was a justified shooting' but was accused of 'victim blaming'

The Facebook posting which was tweeted on the department's official feed continued, 'Warn them that these 'toys' do look like real guns and could result in getting the police called on them. The police may get called to respond to a 'child with a gun'…If the type of gun is in question by the witness the Police will respond as though it is a real gun.'

The post read by many as victim-blaming went onto provide 'tips' for how a child should behave in such a situation. 'Do not run away. They need to no longer have the gun in their hands, throw it away from them. They need to comply with officers instructions. They may be ordered to lie down on the ground.'

Within minutes of tweeting this posting at 7.59am the St Louis County Police City of Fenton Precinct department whose officer wrote the post was facing demands to have their twitter account closed down.

Critics dammed the post as 'heartless' and 'victim blaming' and described the officers as 'psychopaths.' 

Later in the day Chief Jon Belmar used the same page to apologize for the post.

'The post conveyed the message that my officers respond to calls involving a child with a gun with indiscretion and little regard for life,' he admitted.

'The intention of the post was to inform citizens about the potential danger of airsoft or pellet guns resembling real guns. 

'However, the post was a misguided communication strategy and was offensive to many people.

'As Chief of Police, I apologize to Tamir’s family and anyone who was offended by the post. 

'While the post did not originate from the Chief’s Office and I was unaware of its presence prior to its release, I realize the message was insensitive to Tamir’s family and the sorrow they are currently experiencing.' 

But the Fenton officer who wrote the post has defended his actions.

Neighborhood cop Aaron Dilks said 'I too was a kid, and I would have done the same thing as Tamir Rice did.

Profuse apology: Chief Jon Belmar used Facebook to repudiate the earlier post and admit that it suggested his officers do not care about young lives

Mourned: 12-year-old Tamir Rice was buried yesterday after being shot by officers last weekend

Fatal moment: CCTV shows the 12-year-old reaching towards the airsoft gun in his waistband

'I was allowed to go play with guns and have BB guns - we didn't have Airsofts at the time. The point of 'kids will be kids' is that's what kids will do…

'The point of putting [the post] out was to educate and make sure something like this doesn't happen in the city of Fenton or in our area.'

As for Rice, Dilks added, 'It's a tragedy. It's a shame that a child got shot. I guess that's all I should probably say about it.'

The post has now been removed from the facebook page and the link deleted from the force's official twitter feed.

A spokesman for St Louis County Police disowned the posting and described it as unauthorized. The force was preparing to issue a statement at time of writing.
