The Australian family of MH17 victim Gabriele Lauschet have been asked by Malaysia Airlines to provide details of her tax returns, payslips and mortgage repayments before it will make a compensation payment. 

Ms Lauschet's son, Tim Lauschet, was astounded when the airline got in contact with him and claimed that he needed to support his claim for damages with a long list of paperwork, and believes his mother's life should not be means tested. 

Speaking to  Fairfax Media, Mr Lauschet said he felt like he has to 'grovel for a pittance'.

298 people, including 28 Australians, died on the flight, after Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down by a missile, over rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine on July 17 last year.

Gabriele Lauschet was identified as NSW's sixth victim.

The 47-year-old was flying back to Sydney for the new school term at the German International School in Terrey Hills. 

The Sydney kindergarten teacher who was returning from her German homeland, had taught at the school for 15 years.

Malaysia Airlines' have paid Mr Lauschet a $50,000 advance payment, however, they have now asked him to provide nine documents to support his claim that there is a 'loss of financial dependency upon his mother at the time of her death.'

However, lawyers, who are also representing a number of other families of MH17 victims, say the victims' lives should not be means tested. 

On March 4, relatives of those killed on MH17 had the chance to view the wreckage of the plane.

For almost all of them, it was the first chance to see the twisted and charred wreckage that lay for months in the battlefields of eastern Ukraine after the plane plunged to the ground July 17.

The wreckage was brought back to the Netherlands, where civil and criminal investigations are underway to establish the cause of the disaster and attempt to prosecute those responsible. 

Since the horror, Moscow has repeatedly claimed that MH17 was shot down by a Ukrainian warplane in the skies close to the Malaysian plane, while also vigorously denying the West's analysis that it was hit by a BUK missile fired by pro-Moscow rebels.

Yesterday, Dutch experts returned to the Ukraine to probe the MH17 crash site, including visiting a location previously considered unsafe because of fighting with pro-Russian separatists.

A Dutch television station on Thursday claimed it had proof that the Boeing 777 was shot down by a BUK missile based on an independent analysis of metal fragments one of its journalists removed from the crash site.

The Dutch Safety Board however issued a statement saying there was nothing to prove that the fragment came from the missile that brought the plane down, and that its own conclusions would be confirmed by 'multiple sources and not only from fragments'. 

Dutch broadcaster RTL said it had had the shrapnel tested by international forensic experts, including defence analysts IHSJane's in London, who said it matched the explosive charge of aBUK, a Russian-made anti-aircraft missile system.
