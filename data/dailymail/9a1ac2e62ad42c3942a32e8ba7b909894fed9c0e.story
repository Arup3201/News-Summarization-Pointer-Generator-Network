Horrific surveillance footage showed the moment a passenger brutally beat a driver who ordered him off the bus for swearing.

Police have identified Kiel Duggins, 24, as the man who viciously punched Intercity Transit bus driver, Robert Weigelt, more than a dozen times on Tuesday afternoon, after Weigelt told him he was fed up with his profane language.

The men were nose-to-nose when Duggins allegedly threatened the driver, 'If you hit me in the face, we will fight to the death.'

When Weigelt tried to shove him off the bus in Washington, Duggins pushed him onto a seat and repeatedly smashed his face before telling him that he wanted to taste his blood.

KTVU.com reported Weigelt was on his route on the west 
side of Olympia when he and the rider began to argue.

The video, which also has audio, showed the driver approaching Duggins and threatening to call the cops.

'I told you once. I'm not gonna tell you again,' the driver said to the man. 'Get off my bus!'

Duggins then followed the driver and the two continued yelling.

'If you hit me in the face, we will fight to the death,' the man said to the driver.

The driver responded: 'And if you hit me, I can hit you back.'

When the driver tried to push the man out of the door, the man pummeled him to the horror of the other passengers.

Good Samaritan: Another passenger on the bus tried to pull the man off the driver during the brutal attack

A Good Samaritan on the bus, 21-year-old River Nason, saw what was happening and grabbed on to Duggins, trying to pull him off the driver.

'If this guy doesn’t stop he’s going to do some serious damage to this guy. There’s no way I’m going to be a witness to a murder,' Nason told KIRO-TV after the incident.

Before Duggins got off the bus, he crouched over the abused driver and mocked him: 'You bleeding? Is that real blood? Let me taste it'.

When the man fled, passengers called 911 and the driver was rushed to hospital with a broken nose and bruising. He was released from hospital on Tuesday night.

Weigelt told KTVU.com his memory of what happened after the first couple of punches was hazy, but credited Nason with saving his life.

Meanwhile, police found Duggins about two hours after the attack at an IT transit center downtown. Transit employees recognized the man from photos of the incident and called police.

The Olympian reported that Duggins allegedly told police who found him, 'he would not have had to hit him if he had not shoved him' and that 'he was having a bad day'.

Duggins has been charged with second-degree assault and is being held in the Thurston County Jail for investigation of assault. His bail is set at $20,000 dollars.

Duggins' court-appointed attorney James Shackleton told the court his client wasn't a danger to anyone if he was taking medication.

According to court papers obtained by The Olympian, Duggins told court staff that 'he takes medication for mental health issues, but is not current with his medication routine.'

Duggins reportedly does not have a criminal history.

Intercity Transit said it is investigating the horrific incident.

'Drivers are trained to do what they 
need to do to take care of themselves and protect our passengers,' 
spokesman Kris Fransen said.
