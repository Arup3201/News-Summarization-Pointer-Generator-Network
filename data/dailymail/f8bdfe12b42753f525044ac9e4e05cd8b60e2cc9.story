Dramatic CCTV footage has shown the moment a mentally ill 17-year-old girl was shot dead by police after she lunged at officers with a butcher's knife.

Kristiana Coignard was killed in the lobby of Longview Police Station in Texas on Wednesday after a Taser failed to stop her.

The shooting has come in for criticism amid increased scrutiny in the United States surrounding law enforcement's use of deadly force.

The in the footage released by Longview Police Department, the 17-year-old can be seen lunging at officers with a butcher's knife 

It is thought the Coignard had also held up her hand, where she had wrote, 'I have a gun' on her skin 

Today Longview Police have released the CCTV footage of the incident, which shows Coignard entering the foyer of the police station and using the lobby phone.

It is thought she requested help but would not say why she needed it.

Officer Glenn Derr, who was the first to respond can then be seen approaching the teenager, who held up her hand, which had 'I have a gun' written on it.

The footage then shows Officer Derr struggling with the girl and trying to subdue her and at one point, the officer throws her to the ground.

As she lies on the floor, Officer Derr can be seen kneeling and holding her down, before he suddenly gets up and steps back.

One of the officers then uses a Taser gun on the teenager before the other two follow up with gun shots 

It is thought he broke away when he realised that Coignard was reaching for a butcher's knife she had hidden in her waistband.

Officers Gene Duffie and Grace Bagley then arrive on the scene as Coignard is seen charging at Derr.

Officer Duffie then fires his Taser before Officers Derr and Bagley quickly followed with gunshots.

Further details of the shooting emerged following statements from Longview Police Chief Don Dingler and spokeswoman Kristie Brian.

Chief Dingler said the officers were justified in shooting the girl.

He said: 'All the patrol officers carry Tasers, plus expandable batons.

Kristiana Coignard, 17, who was shot dead by the officers. Her aunt said that her niece had a history of mental health problems  

After Coignard was shot four times in the station on Thursday (pictured), three Longview police officers were placed on paid leave on Friday

'I think you'll see from the video that the time was a factor. There was no time for the officers to use other means.'

All three officers are on paid administrative leave while the Texas Rangers investigate the shooting.

The girl's family has said she had mental health problems and have questioned why police had to shoot her.

She had been living with her aunt, Heather Robertson, before her death.

Ms Robertson said her niece had been battling mental illness, including bipolar disorder and depression, and had been hospitalized twice after attempting suicide, Think Progress reported.

She said Coignard 'was only violent with herself' and has questioned the events in the police station. 

'I think it was a cry for help. I think they could have done something.'

'They are grown men. I think there is something they are not telling us.'
