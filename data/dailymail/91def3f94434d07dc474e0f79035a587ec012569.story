Ollie Proudlock and Joey Essex may have been widely mocked for their love of feminine floral shirts - but it seems that the joke is on us, because men everywhere are embracing flower power this summer.

New sales figures from fashion data analysts Editd show that sales of men's floral pieces are up 130 per cent since last year - and Asos has already sold out of its floral suit for men.

The seeds of the flower trend were sown at the SS14 men's shows, with heavy hitter Prada sending models down the runway clad in huge lotus prints, while Christopher Kane worked graphic lilies into his collection.

Setting the trends: We may have mocked Joey Essex, left, and Made In Chelsea's Ollie Proudlock, right, for their love of all things floral - but sales are up 130 per cent and if men want to be on-trend this summer, it's time to embrace flower power

Since then, fashion-forward men such as Made In Chelsea's Ollie Proudlock, Nick Grimshaw and even Kanye West have all been embracing the look.

Speaking to MailOnline, a spokesperson for Asos said: 'There's been a slow burning under-current around florals for the last couple of seasons with the Hawaiian shirt dropping in and out of trend as the seasons come and go.

'More notably for us at Asos, the trend started with floral panels, pockets and yokes on tees but has now quite dramatically transitioned into full floral suits, formal shirt, shorts and polos.

'Sales are up approximately 90 per cent and we're definitely seeing a better reaction to darker base florals.

With summer fast upon us, other high street retailers are rolling out floral themed designs.

The classic Hawaiian print shirt - that wouldn't have looked out of place on your 60-year-old uncle a few years back - is big news over at Topman, while matchesfashion.com has nearly sold out of floral paisley espadrilles. Even Nike are working pretty flowers onto its super-cool trainers.

How will you wear yours? Nick Grimshaw, left, who is known for being one step ahead of the trends, wears a subtle paisley shirt, while his friend goes for a loud and proud suit

But how on earth do you pull the look off without looking like a walking flowerbed?

Thomas Merrigan, menswear writer at Oxbloodandwolf.wordpress.com, said: 'Florals have seen a strong comeback this year but they take some guts to
 pull off.

'Avoid partnering with other prints, opt for solid colours 
from the pattern for any accompanying garments.

'If you're looking to 
experiment with floral, before going full blown floral shirt, try adding
 an accent with a pocket square or a tie first.'

Fresh off the runway: The floral trend was witnessed at Jonathan Saunders' SS14 show, left, and judging by the Burberry AW14 catwalk, right, it will be sticking around for a few more months

Speaking about the trend, fashion writer Simon Glazin said: 'I don’t know about you, but whenever I see floral prints at this time of year, one thing pops into my head: 'Florals, for spring. Groundbreaking!' as quoted by Miranda Priestly in the Devil Wears Prada.

'Givenchy's Riccardo Tisci didn't listen though. He went full on floral 
for his SS14 pre-collection for us men.'

'It's definitely a Marmite 
fashion situation. Personally, I think Tisci's bright pink flowers 
are perfect for spring.

'They are too much, of course they are - this is 
the man who printed Rottweilers on literally everything a few seasons 
back. I'm a sucker for an all-over print but when is too much enough? Ever?'

Selling out: Fashion e-tailer Asos says sales of floral designs are up 90 per cent already this season (bomber, left, £34.99, T-shirt, right, £22)

It's a sell out: Asos has already sold out of a floral suit similar to this design, £150

Embrace the trend: If all over florals are too much for you, you can experiment with the trend in a more subtle way - like on your feet (left, Nike Air Trainer, £110 right, Gourmet 35 Lite Floral Trainers, £105)
