A wave of H7N9 bird flu in
China that has spread into people may have the potential to
emerge as a pandemic strain in humans, scientists have warned. 

The H7N9 virus, one of several strains of bird flu known to
be able to infect humans, has persisted, diversified and spread
in chickens across China, the researchers said.

This has fulled a resurgence of infections in people, posing a wider threat.

In a study published in the journal Nature, they said: 'The expansion of genetic diversity and geographical spread
indicates that, unless effective control measures are in place,
H7N9 could be expected to persist and spread beyond the region.'

The H7N9 bird flu virus emerged in humans in March 2013.

It has since then infected at least 571 people in China, Taipei,
Hong Kong, Malaysia and Canada, killing 212 of them, according
to February data from the World Health Organization (WHO).

After an initial flare up of human cases at the start of
2013, the H7N9 appeared to die down - aided in large part by
Chinese authorities deciding to close live poultry markets and
issue health warnings about direct contact with chickens.

But infections in people increased again last year and in
early 2015.

This promoted researchers to try to understand more
about how the virus re-emerged, how it might develop, and how it
might threaten public health.

In this study, an international team of scientists led by Yi
Guan of Hong Kong university monitored the evolution and spread
of H7N9 over 15 cities across five provinces in China.

By collecting and sequencing a large number of samples, they
found that the H7N9 virus is mutating frequently, acquiring
genetic changes that might increase its pandemic potential.

A large number of new genetic variants of the virus have
become established in chickens and have spread across the
country, probably because of poultry trade movement, they said.

Flu experts not directly involved in the research said its
findings were interesting but did not necessarily show the H7N9
was changing in ways that made it more likely to develop into a
pandemic flu strain.

'What we don't know from this paper is the significance of
all these mutations that are accumulating as the virus persists
and spreads,' said Wendy Barclay, an expert in flu virology at
Imperial College, London.

'This is especially relevant
for human health - does any of this change the pandemic
potential of the virus?,' she told Reuters Health.  

In its latest update on the flu strain, the Geneva-based WHO
said it 'continues to closely monitor the H7N9 situation' and
conduct risk assessments.

'So far, the overall risk associated with the H7N9 virus has
not changed,' it said.

Yi Guan's team, however, said their analysis pointed to a
need for heightened vigilance of H7N9 and for curbing direct
human contact with live poultry at markets.

'Permanent closure of live poultry markets, central
slaughtering and preventing inter-regional poultry
transportation during disease outbreaks are needed to reduce the
threat of H7N9 to public health,' they wrote.
