Parents were left in a flap when they spotted this bizarre coloured chicken on the loose outside a school.

The feathered bird, which has a distinctive pink hue, was pictured running around in Nottingham earlier this month.

The picture was posted on the Bramcote Animal Rescue Facebook page, in a bid to find out more information about the brightly coloured bird.

The pink-coloured bird was spotted on the loose in Nottingham, leading to numerous theories on Facebook

More than 20 people commented, speculating where the chicken may have come from.

Lotus Shephard wrote: '[Is it a] chicken wearing make-up?'

But Susanna Zabulis thought it looked more like 'a small bald turkey'. 

Julia Street added: 'I'd guess someone did a spray job on it.'

Claire Everard suggested someone may have sprayed the bird with an anti-pecking spray.

Another added: 'It looks like it's had a tandoori marinade already but must have jumped out the pot.'

But Glenn Mills, who says he is a farmer, identified it as a 'dishevelled' Rhode Island Red hen - an American breed of chicken.

Some speculated it is a 'bald turkey' while others thought someone had sprayed the bird the unusual colour

Farmer Glenn Mills said the bird is a Rhode Island Red hen, pictured, a usually rust-coloured American breed of chicken 

An RSPCA spokesman said: 'It isn't clear what type of chicken it is, despite the markings on the feathers.

'It is difficult to say from the photograph, which is taken at some distance. If it is dyed then this is potentially a cruel and unnecessary thing to do to an animal.

'Dyeing or painting a bird could cause allergic reactions and compromise the animals’ ability to communicate with other animals of their own and other species and make them more vulnerable to predators.'
