Rory McIlroy has settled his bitter court battle with his former agent over the right to back out of the contract in a deal believed to have cost him more than £16.5 million.

The world's number one golfer was suing Conor Ridge's Horizon Sports Management over the cut the firm was taking from on-and off-course earnings.

But today the High Court in Dublin was told that the row had been resolved following ten hours of last-ditch negotiations between the star's lawyers and advisers and the company.

Rory McIlroy (pictured at court yesterday) has settled his multi-million pound legal dispute with his former agent over the right to back out of the contract he claimed he was misled into signing

McIlroy was not in court for the brief hearing and the terms of the settlement were not detailed in court.

But a source close to the case said the settlement was 'far north' of $20 million, the equivalent of £13.1 million, which McIlroy is believed to have paid to Horizon Sports Management.

'It's in the public domain that the amount of money owing under the contract and the money likely to be generated from the the contract was $20 million,' a source said. 

'The settlement was in excess of that, plus costs.'

It is understood the figure was $25 million, or £16.4 million, which includes substantial legal costs.

McIlroy, fresh from a weekend victory in Dubai, had sued Mr Ridge's agency over the cut his firm was taking from on and off-course earnings in a potentially ugly row over £4.2 million in fees.

Mr Ridge, who was flanked by supporters in the public gallery, hugged and kissed them after the announcement was made.

A brief statement agreed between the McIlroy and Ridge camps was released following the hearing.

'The legal dispute between Rory McIlroy and Horizon Sports Management has been settled to the satisfaction of both parties, who wish each other well for the future,' it said.

'The parties will be making no further comment.'

The two sides had been locked in talks for about 10 hours yesterday at the Four Courts complex in central Dublin, with McIlroy leaving last night at about 9pm without making any comment.

When the case was called this morning, Paul Gallagher, senior counsel for McIlroy, told the court: 'The entire matter has been resolved.'

Judge Brian Cregan said the dispute was undoubtedly a long and difficult issue for both sides to deal with.

He also wished Mr Ridge success as a sports agent in the future and McIlroy success on the golf course.

McIlroy is believed to have offered Ridge almost £8m to settle prior to Tuesday's adjournment at the High Court.

That offer was turned down by Ridge, who was confident his company had a watertight contract with McIlroy that entitled them to somewhere between 15 and 20 per cent of his endorsement money until 2017. 

McIlroy's deal with Nike, which he signed while with Horizon, is reportedly worth around £150 million, which gave Horizon plenty of reasons to fight for a larger settlement.

McIlroy had terminated his contract with Horizon in 2013 to form his own company, and was suing the form and leading agent Mr Ridge, claiming he was misled into signing the contract.

In court papers when the case was launched later that year, it was claimed that McIlroy signed up with Mr Ridge's agency at an informal meeting on the day of Horizon's Christmas party in 2011.

Mr Ridge had counter-sued the golfer after the lawsuit was launched in late 2013 for walking away from his contract - claiming that he owed the company millions of dollars in lost commissions. 

The case had been scheduled for eight weeks in the big business division of the Irish High Court - reserved for cases where disputes are worth more than 1 million euro (£755,000) - before the prospect of long and potentially personal arguments being teased out in full public view led to renewed attempts at a settlement.

Two days of talks between both camps last December yielded nothing.

The dispute centred on McIlroy's contract with Dublin-based Horizon and two other linked companies - Malta-based Gurteen, and Canovan Management, also based in the Irish capital.

At the heart of it was rates the golfer was being charged - pre-tax 5 per cent of prize winnings and 20 per cent of sponsorship and appearances money.

When the lawsuit was launched in late 2013, McIlroy's lawyer had contended that the fees were up to four times what one of the best golfers in the world would expect to pay to agents. 

The golf star, who took up the game as a youngster in Holywood, Co Down, and now has a home in Florida, claims the terms were inferior to those given to other top 10 players including fellow countryman and major winning friend Graeme McDowell, who was in the same stable. 

McIlroy's business interests are now overseen by Rory McIlroy Incorporated, which is headed by Donal Casey, formerly of Horizon, his father Gerry and family friend and business executive Barry Funston, who also oversees much of the golfer's charitable work under the Rory McIlroy Foundation.

Along with the golfer's personal assistant Sean O'Flaherty and family member Brian McIlroy, the golfer's team spent about 10 hours in the Four Courts yesterday thrashing out the terms of the deal. His father Gerry arrived at the courts yesterday at 5pm.

None were in court today.

Among the disputes raised when the case was launched was a row over an alleged 166,000 euro (£125,350) donation to Unicef on the eve of a trip to Haiti when McIlroy was an ambassador for the charity.

There was another fallout over Horizon using complimentary airline seats on a flight to Abu Dhabi booked by tournament organisers in McIlroy's name.

The young golfer's career soared in the year after he signed for Mr Ridge from Chubby Chandler's stable earning more than £10 million in 2012, before a slump took hold in 2013 and earnings fell back to around £1.5 million.

Last season McIlroy appeared more driven, earning more than £7 million, and he is now favourite to complete the career grand slam of golf at the US Masters in April.

McIlroy was with Horizon when he won the 2012 PGA Championship, rose to number one in the world and signed the five-year sponsorship deal with Nike.

A dip in form followed and his engagement to tennis star Caroline Wozniacki ended, but the Northern Irishman has four majors to his name.

If recent form on the course offers any insight into his demeanour with a massive and costly contract row hanging over him, McIlroy appeared focused when picking up his latest trophy.

Sunday's win at the Dubai Desert Classic is a repeat of his first as a professional back in 2009.

McIlroy is due back in competition Honda Classic at Palm Beach in Florida at the end of the month where the winner will walk away with £724,00.
