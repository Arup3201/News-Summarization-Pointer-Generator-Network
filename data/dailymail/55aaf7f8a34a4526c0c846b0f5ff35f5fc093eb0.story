Ahmed Abu Khatalla is accused of the 2011 attack on the US compound in Benghazi which claimed the life of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others

A Libyan militant accused of the 2012 terrorist attack on the US embassy in Benghazi was told that he faces the death penalty after a grand jury indicted him on 18 charges. 

Ahmed Abu Khatalla, 43, was captured by US special forces in June and brought to the court where a grand jury decided upon which charges he should face. 

Khatalla was initially held on one count of conspiracy to support terrorists resulting in the death of US officials. But additional charges were added to the indictment.

As a result of the indictment, Khatalla faces multiple death penalty charges. Among the capital charges, Khatalla is accused of the murder of an internationally protected person as well as killing a person in a federal facility. 

After his arrest, Khatalla was brought to the US on a naval vessel and remains in custody in Alexandra, Virginia. 

Khatalla has so far pleaded guilty although he is due to return to court in Washington next week. 

His public defender Michelle Peterson said: 'It is important to remember that an indictment is merely a set of allegations or charges, it is not evidence. We will vigorously defend Mr. Abu Khatallah? in court where the government will be forced to prove his guilt, based upon actual evidence.'

Khatalla is accused of being a ringleader in the September 11, 2012 attack which killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other US nationals. 

It is also claimed that the terrorists ransacked a number of classified computers inside in the compoud. 

According to prosecutors, Khattala drove to the diplomatic mission with other militants and a group of about 20 breached the main gate and later launched an attack with assault rifles, grenades and other weapons. That initial attack killed Stevens and communications specialist Sean Smith and set the mission ablaze.

Prosecutors say Khattala supervised the plunder of sensitive information from that building, then returned to a camp in Benghazi where a large group began assembling for an attack on a second building known as the annex. The attack on that facility, including a precision mortar barrage, resulted in the deaths of security officers Tyrone Snowden Woods and Glen Anthony Doherty, authorities say.

In the attack's immediate aftermath, Obama administration officials, including Susan Rice, currently White House national security adviser, stoked political controversy by initially saying the attack was a spontaneous protest against an anti-Muslim video that had surfaced in the United States.

Evidence later emerged that U.S. agencies had been warning for months about weak security and possible attacks against U.S. facilities in Libya. Evidence also emerged that soon after the attack, the United States had strong reason to believe that organized militant groups had been involved.

In media interviews before his capture by U.S. forces, Khatallah denied involvement in the attacks against a compound used by the State Department as a consular office and a nearby compound used by the CIA as its Benghazi base.

The new U.S. indictment alleges Khatallah had been the commander of an militant Islamist militia called Ubaydah bin Jarrah. That group later merged with another Libyan group called Ansar al Sharia, and Khatallah became one of its Benghazi-based leaders, U.S. authorities said.
