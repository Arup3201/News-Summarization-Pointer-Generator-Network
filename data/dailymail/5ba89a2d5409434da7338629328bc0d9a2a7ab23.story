Danger: Justin and Selena pictured riding an ATV on Friday in Canada... when TMZ claim the singer was arrested after a collision with a minivan

Ontario Provincial Police said the incident happened Friday afternoon near Bieber's hometown of Stratford and that he was released on a promise to appear in court Sept. 29.

They said the driver of the ATV and an occupant of the minivan 'engaged in a physical altercation.'

Bieber's lawyer Brian H. Greenspan released a statement today, saying: 'Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez' peaceful retreat in Stratford this weekend was unfortunately disrupted by the unwelcome presence of paparazzi.

Justin Bieber pleaded guilty earlier this month to misdemeanor charges of careless driving and resisting arrest seven months after his arrest in Miami Beach following what police initially called an illegal street drag race.He was also charged in Toronto with assaulting a limousine driver in late December. Police allege Bieber hit a limousine driver several times in the back of the head after he and five others were picked up by a limo in the early hours of Dec. 30.

Just last month, Bieber rear-ended his Ferrari after he claimed he spotted a photographer following him.

The
 incident follows another minor car accident that saw Bieber lash out on
 Twitter after a photographer allegedly crashed into the back of his red
 Ferrari while chasing him through Los Angeles last month.

Shortly
 after the incident, Bieber tweeted: 'There should be laws against what I
 just experienced. We should have learned from the death of Princess 
Diana... I don't have a problem with Paparazzi but when they act 
recklessly they put us all in danger.'

The
 Canadian star was driving his Ferrari in West Hollywood last month when
 he reportedly noticed the photographer following him in a Prius.

A source told TMZ that the singer slammed on his breaks and the paparazzo rear-ended him.No one was injured in the crash, but Justin's car was scratched.

Bieber
 has been accused of driving recklessly several times in the past, and 
was issued a stern warning by police officers in Beverly Hills last 
week, who blasted him for 'putting other people's safety in jeopardy' 
after he was captured on video illegally driving his three-wheeled 
motorcycle on the sidewalk to avoid traffic.

Earlier
 this month, Bieber pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of careless 
driving and resisting arrest seven months after his arrest in Miami 
Beach following what police initially called an illegal street drag 
race.

Bieber
 is also charged in Toronto with assaulting a limousine driver in late 
December.
