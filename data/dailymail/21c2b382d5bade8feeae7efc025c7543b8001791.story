Alex Lewis lost both legs and arms to a Strep A infection, which triggered septicaemia and toxic shock syndrome

A father-of-one is today relearning to walk after losing all four limbs to a  flesh eating bug.

This time last year Alex Lewis was fighting for his life, after a common cold triggered a strep A infection, septicaemia and toxic shock syndrome.

He lost both arms and legs, as well as his lips.

But today, for the first time since he was robbed of the ability to walk, the 34-year-old is standing for himself and has taken his first steps unaided.

He is starting his long road to recovery on shorter artificial limbs, but hopes to walk down the aisle with his partner Lucy Townsend next summer.

He aims to stand at the alter on full-size prosthetics as the couple tie the knot.

Mr Lewis shocked the mother of his son when he proposed, despite years of telling Miss Townsend he never wanted marry.

But in the face of a life-changing year Mr Lewis said he wants nothing more than to make the mother of his three-year-old son, Sam, his wife.

'It was because of everything that has happened throughout the year,' he said. 

'She has been my constant support, she has raised my son, she has been incredible. I could think of no better reason to ask her.'   

Miss Townsend said she had put thoughts of a wedding aside whilst supporting Alex on his road to recovery.

The couple joke how Mr Lewis's constant refusal to tie the knot before his illness struck - even betting his mum £100 he never would - formed the basis of a test by doctors to see whether he was brain damaged as a result of the illness.

Miss Townsend, 41, said: 'We had to ask Alex a question that we were sure he would know, so I said to ask him whether he would marry me - and his immediate answer was no! We knew straight away then that he was fine.'

She said she was stunned when he asked her and described how their relationship had not changed. 

'I am not his nurse, I don't think I would make a very good one! He has his nurse, who is fantastic, to help him and he really works a lot of things out for himself,' Miss Townsend said. 'We are here for him as his family.'

The couple plan get married in France next year.

By then Mr Lewis, 34, is aiming to be up on full-sized prosthetic limbs in order to stand side by side with his bride as they say their vows.

'She tells me that she won't marry anyone shorter than her so I have got to be up on prosthetic limbs for that reason alone,' he said.

He also described how the proposal wasn't overly romantic, adding: 'If I had tried to get down on one knee, I wouldn't have got up again.'

The father-of-one, from Hampshire, was struck by the infection last November after suffering a common cold

It is that humour which has helped the family get through some of the darkest days since Alex became a quadruple amputee.

He lost three limbs, part of his nose and his lips when the normally harmless bacterial infection Group A Streptococcus, rapidly developed into multiple organ failure, septicaemia and toxic shock syndrome.

When pioneering surgery to try and save his remaining arm failed, the father-of-one was admitted to hospital in June for an emergency amputation.

As well as learning to walk again Mr Lewis is undergoing facial reconstruction, which will continue next year with four more operations planned. 

He said: 'Even thing like opening the door has to be approached in a whole new way. When you rely on mechanics you have to approach things in a completely different way.

'It has been challenging but I don't think there is anything I can't do that I want to now.'

Now he is walking for himself Alex plans to take the family dog Holly and do some Christmas shopping.

And he hopes he will one day be able to chase Sam around in the garden of their Southampton home.

He knows he faces a long road to full recovery, but he said it is all about setting goals and reaching them.

'You have to see yourself doing it and get there,' Mr Lewis said.

As well as relearning how to walk, Mr Lewis is also facing a series of operations to rebuild his lips 

'I had thought about how it would feel when I walked for myself for the first time and when it actually happened it wasn't as emotional as I thought, and had been told it would be. It just felt normal, like this is how it is supposed to be.'

Talking about how he felt on the first anniversary of when his life was irrevocably changed a year ago this month, he said: 'It was more Lucy, mum and dad and the rest of my friends and family I felt regret for. I was pretty much out of it. For them, they were living it.'

Mr Lewis spent that day working on the Alex Lewis Trust - a charity he and Miss Townsend set up - before going out with friends in the evening where they raised a glass of champagne.

'It wasn't in celebration or commiseration, just an acknowledgment really of what happened a year ago,' he added. 'That date will always be significant to me. That is my New Year, that is where it all started again for me.'

Since setting up the Alex Lewis Trust which aims to raise money to help pay for Alex's rehabilitation and for the hospital where he was treated, around £180,000 poured in.

Mr Lewis, said: 'I am continually amazed with the public support. It has been incredible. What people are doing to raise money is just amazing, I can't thank them enough.'
