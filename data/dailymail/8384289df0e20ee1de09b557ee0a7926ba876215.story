Back in the 2007-08 season a teenage striker by the name of Bojan Krkic was breaking into the Barcelona first team allowing nothing and nobody – not even Thierry Henry and Zlatan Ibrahimovic – could stand in his way.

On the club’s pre-season tour of Scotland, with Henry the expensive new signing from Arsenal, Bojan was the star impressing so much that Barca had to turn down offers from Ajax to take him on loan.

He stayed to fight for a place in the first team and became Barcelona’s youngest-ever goalscorer when he netted against Villarreal that October aged 17 years and 54 days and he was called up to the Spain squad, only to pull out because of sickness.

The long-standing debate of whether 
Lionel Messi could hack a wet, windy Tuesday night in Stoke captures football 
fans' imaginations and we'll soon see whether Bojan can.

In the April after Bojan became Barcelona's youngest-ever scorer, the La Liga giants drew Manchester United in the Champions League semi-final.

Then-manager Frank Rijkaard was under pressure to pick the youngster instead of Henry - after all, the kid from the youth team had eight league goals to his name, one more than the Frenchman, having played fewer minutes.

His strike against Schalke in the quarter-finals had opened the scoring in the first-leg and Henry himself admitted: 'You can understand it. He is having a fantastic season. He is a Catalan kid and the supporters love nothing more than to have a local hero.'

Things got even better for the local hero in the following seasons. Pep Guardiola was promoted from the B-team to first-team coach and although at first that stunted Bojan’s development because the two had not always seen eye to eye the season before, eventually Guardiola was won over.

When the 2009-10 season started Barcelona began the campaign with Ibrahimovic, Leo Messi and Henry in attack but it was Bojan who finished up as first choice with the disgruntled Zlatan left out of key end of season matches.

The competition to stay in the team continued relentless however, and when Ibrahimovic left the following summer David Villa turned up. With Villa, Messi and the emerging Pedro, Guardiola found the front three that was to destroy Manchester United in the 2011 Champions League final at Wembley.

Bojan the boy wonder had become the forgotten man. And like so many schooled by Barca who then have to make their way beyond the confines of the Nou Camp, he found it tough.

He had been at Barcelona since signing as an eight-year-old. His Serbian-born father, then a Barca scout, had played for Red Star Belgrade before moving to Catalonia where he met Bojan’s mother.

His dad was the driving force in his son’s career as he scored more than 900 goals in various levels of the club’s youth system before becoming the third youngest first-team player in the club’s history in September 2007.

It had been too much too young, perhaps. Even the Spain call-up had been brought forward because his dual-nationality made him eligible for Serbia.

He had won the player of the tournament award two years running in the Under 17 European Championship, made his debut for the Under 21 side aged just 16, and became the second youngest player ever to represent his country when he finally made his debut in 2008 but the international career never got going and he faded from view at Barcelona.

Bojan's move to Stoke will see him team up with former Barcelona defender Marc Muniesa, who signed at the start of July.

Muniesa, who had been at the Nou Camp since starting his youth career in 2002 - three years after Bojan, was unable to tie down a regular place at Barcelona.

There was a lack of versatility in his game. As a youngster he had shone as a scampering centre-forward, always appearing at the right time with the perfect finish. But when Messi moved to a central position under Guardiola, Bojan would have to readjust to the demands of playing as a wide forward in Barça’s 4-3-3 and he never managed it.

Now, after unsuccessful spells under current Barca manager Luis Enrique at Roma, and under another former Barcelona player Frank De Boer at Ajax, he finds himself under yet another one-time Barca player in Mark Hughes.

The Premier League will be tough. He’s only 23 but this shot at the most competitive league in the world feels like a last chance to fulfil all that early promise.

Former coach Rijkaard once said of him: ‘He is a special player who always makes the right decision on the pitch.’

He has taken a big decision off it this summer. Those at Barcelona who remember how he once upstaged one of the Premier League’s greatest ever performers, Henry, will hope it turns out well for him.

Is he up to it? The Premier League will be tough on Bojan but he's got his chance to show what he's worth
