She is the girl who was shot in the head because she wanted girls to be able to go to school and he was the boy whose positive attitude to terminal cancer led people to donate millions to help other teenagers with the disease.

Malala Yousafzai, 17, who was shot by the Taliban two years ago, and Stephen Sutton of Staffordshire, have been named as the most inspirational people of 2014. 

The pair appear on a list of influential figures and moments of the last 12 months, which also includes the poppy installation at Tower Bridge. 

The installation saw millions of people flock to see dozens of ceramic poppies placed in the moat to remember those who died in the First World War 100 years ago.

The poll also asked people to name the most inspirational moment of 2014 - with the poppies installation at the Tower of London, where hundreds of ceramic poppies were placed in the moat - earning top place 

Malala achieved the top spot on the list for her work campaigning for young people to have the right to an education. 

The 17-year-old, of Birmingham, was undeterred after she was shot by the Taliban in Pakistan in 2012 as she boarded a bus. Her work saw her become the youngest person ever to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

The inspirational list was created from a survey of 2,000 people and is supported by the Discovery Channel TV station.  

Stephen Sutton, 19, of Burntwood in Staffordshire, raised £5million for charity after being diagnosed with colorectal cancer. 

His positive attitude to his cancer diagnosis saw the teenager track his battle with the disease on a blog and post a 'final thumbs up' which was shared around the world and saw people donate millions to his chosen charity, Teenage Cancer Trust. 

The pair were placed above Prince Harry who claimed third place for his role in creating the Invictus Games which was an international Paralympic-style event for wounded and injured armed services personnel.

Dozens of flags were planted near Asnelles, France, to mark the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings 

The D-Day Anniversary and the UK remaining united following the Scottish referendum in September were also cited as being 'inspirational moments'.

The research also explored the events we feel have most inspired the nation in the last twelve months.

The famous poppy installation, named 'Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red' which featured 888,246 ceramic poppies planted in the moat at the Tower of London and was created by artist Paul Cummins, topped the poll.

The D-Day 70th anniversary commemorations were the second most inspirational moment of the past 12 months.

This was followed by Scotland failing to win independence in September and remaining in the UK.

Same sex marriage and the Rosetta Probe landing on Philae Comet also featured in the list.

3. Prince Harry - creating the Invictus Games

4. Angelina Jolie - human rights activism

The 70th anniversary of the D-Day commemorations were named one of the most inspirational moments 

As well as looking back over the last year, the study also predicts events that are likely to capture the nation's interest in the next 12 months.

Celebrating the Queen surpassing Queen Victoria as the longest-serving monarch is expected to be the most important day in 2015. 

This is followed by NASA's mission to Pluto and Victory in Europe Day in May.

A Discovery Channel spokesman said: 'From the Invictus Games to the poppy installation at Tower Bridge, the last 12 months has seen incredible stories of courage and inspiration from across the world.'
