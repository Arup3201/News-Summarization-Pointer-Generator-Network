The Duchess of Cornwall yesterday declared herself 'humbled' by the courage of a group of rape survivors.

And she vowed to use her position as a member of the Royal Family to do everything she could to bring the issue of sexual violence against women 'out of the shadows and into the light'.

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline during a four-day tour of Colombia with her husband, the Prince of Wales, Camilla made clear she wanted the difficult - and often socially uncomfortable - issue of rape and sexual abuse to be a cornerstone of her work

Courage: Camilla says she was left 'humbled' by the courage of the rape victims she met in Bogota

Gift: During the meeting, Camilla was presented with a traditional mochila bag made for her by the women

The Duchess, wearing a pistachio Anna Valentine suit, was taking part in a Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative event in the capital Bogota involving campaigners and victims.

Colombia is just emerging from five decades of bloody civil war which has seen the deaths of an estimated 250,000 people, many innocent civilians.

The country has also seen during that time some of the most appalling human rights abuses and violations recorded.

Of 6.9 million victims registered by the Government, 6,743 are officially recorded as victims of sexual violence. But officials believe that is merely the tip of the iceberg due to the stigma of the crime.

One survey estimates that between 2001 and 2009, almost half a million Colombian women were victims of rape and sexual assault in conflict zones. That amounts to an attack every 15 minutes.

The Colombian government has now has set up one of the most comprehensive legal and institutional frameworks in the world to tackle he issue and declared May 25 as the National Day for the dignity of victims of sexual violence.

Admiration: Camilla told MailOnline that she admired the women's determination to bring the issue into the light

Campaign: The Duchess has long worked to highlight the plight of victims of sexual violence

After listening intently to yesterday's discussion, the Duchess told the MailOnline: 'I was humbled by the courage of the Colombian women I met today, who had been raped like so many others, in horrendous circumstances, and I salute their determination to bring rape and sexual abuse out of the shadows into the light.'

Camilla said that it was clear that the only way to banish the stigma of the crime and to encourage more women to come forward to receive the help they needed was to 'keep talking'.

She invited the Colombian delegation - which is supported by the British Embassy in Colombia -- to the UK to look processes for survivors of sexual violence there.

The Duchess is involved with a number of groups in this field in the UK and last year even created and spearheaded an initiative to offer washbags containing soap, shampoo and other toiletries for women who have reported a sexual assault and often undergone traumatic forensic examinations.

One victim who met her was Jineth Bedoya, a Colombian journalist who was kidnaped and raped by paramilitary fighters while covering the conflict.

For many years she kept silent about her ordeal but eventually decide to speak out and launch her own campaign against the issue.

Speaking out: Charles made a speech during the visit to the Centre for Memory, Peace and Reconciliation

Tribute: Camilla, who planted a rose, was joined by at the museum by Maria Clemencia Rodriguez de Santos

She shared a platform with the then Foreign Secretary William Hague during his visit to Colombia earlier this year.

She said of the Duchess: 'To have a woman who is so committed to the topic of sexual violence - to meet her, to talk to her, to listen to her and to learn about her support of this issue -is without a doubt the memory that I take away from this Royal visit and our meeting.

'The Duchess understands our work and our commitment to making visible the women who have been victims of sexual violence. 

'I believe that it is really important to highlight what the Duchess said about the need for the United Kingdom to know about our experience and work and that we get to know the efforts that are being made in the the UK to eradicate sexual violence.'

Another campaigner - and victim - Maria Eugenia Cruz added: 'The situation in Colombia is very difficult. 

Pucker up: Prince Charles, meanwhile, found himself the recipient of a friendly kiss at a village in Macarena

Striking: Charles and President Juan Manuel Santos also visited Cano Cristales in La Macarena National Park

'Sexual violence affects our bodies, our minds and our families. We need more people to speak out and more resources to tackle the issue.

'I want to empower women and help them understand that they have a right to justice. To make visible the crime of sexual violence and to make women realise it's not their fault and there is no shame in what has happened to them.

'I started working with displaced women six years ago and as we campaigned for change, threats against us increased and some of the women were raped. It didn't put me off because it is important that people of the world join together and eradicate sexual violence to stop this from happening to other people.

'Sexual violence requires important people like the Duchess of Cornwall to support victims and make these crimes visible.'
