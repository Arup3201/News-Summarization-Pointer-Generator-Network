Lionel Messi was sounding out Arsenal last season in a move which would have shocked the football world, according to Spanish reports.

The Argentina icon locked heads with Barcelona over his contract last season, but eventually penned an extension in May.

However, top Spanish website Vozpopuli claims that Messi asked Cesc Fabregas to talk to his agent Darren Dein about a move to the Gunners.

Undercover: Messi reportedly asked Cesc Fabregas's agent to discuss a potential move with Arsenal

While 
Fabregas was discussing a return to the Emirates ahead of a move to 
London rivals Chelsea, Messi reportedly discussed the same move.

Messi's buy-out clause is a massive £197million - almost as much as Arsenal's entire transfer history.

The Barca No 10 is also on a huge £16million a year in wages.

The Argentina captain eventually put pen-to-paper on a new deal in May 2014 although the full details of the deal were not disclosed.

It is believed the stand-off with Barcelona stemmed from Messi wanting to be made the highest-paid player in world football.
