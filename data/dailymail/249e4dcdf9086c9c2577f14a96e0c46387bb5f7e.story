Alan Pardew was ecstatic after seeing his Newcastle team end Chelsea's unbeaten start to the season with a 2-1 win  on Saturday - but was bemused after fourth official Robert Madley added six minutes of injury time.

Jose Mourinho's men halved Newcastle's advantage through a Didier Drogba strike on 83 minutes but as the clock reached 90, St James' Park was left  roaring in fury as another six minutes were added on.

And it reminded Toon boss Pardew of visiting Old Trafford under Sir Alex Ferguson's tenure.

Pardew said the decision to add six minutes of time on at the end of the game was like 'Fergie time'

'Talk about Fergie time, that was certainly Mourinho time,' Pardew joked. 

'I was very disappointed with the six minutes because as the home team I’ve never had that.'

But Pardew made time to credit referee Martin Atkinson for allowing Newcastle to play on after a foul on Ayoze Perez, as the move ended in Papiss Cisse's second goal of the game.

'I have to pay tribute to him as well because the foul on Ayoze, he plays on and we get the second goal. You have got to take everything into account,' Pardew said.

Despite Chelsea's first defeat of the season handing second-placed Manchester City the opportunity to narrow the gap between the two sides to three points when they take on Everton later on Saturday, Pardew still believes Chelsea will win the Premier League.

'That was about character (and) discipline against the best team probably in Europe at the moment,' Pardew added.

'They had chances, so you have to ride your luck, you need everything to go your way if you are going to beat a team as good as them. 

'They're consistently great, a consistently brilliant side and they’ll take some stopping still to win the league but today was our day.'
