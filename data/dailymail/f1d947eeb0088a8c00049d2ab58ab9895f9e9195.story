She is the ultra-glamorous Pussycat Doll who soared to glory on this year's X Factor when her act James Arthur won.

Her 'sha-mazing' performance on the show won her countless new fans - many of whom gaped at her dazzling dresses on the show week after week.

And now, the sha-mazing star herself has revealed just what she's going to be wearing this 25 December: A pair of not-so glamorous Spanx.

The suck-me-in control pants have fast become the go-to garment for celebrities and regular folk alike looking to banish the bulge and avoid the dreaded VPL - and they are now set to make up Nicole's Christmas look too.

Dazzling: Slender Nicole doesn't look to be in need of Spanx - but the star says she loves the control pants - whether she's wearing them under these X Factor gowns is as yet unconfirmed

Even slender young stars like Katy Perry, Tulisa and Kristen Stewart admit to wearing them, and everyone from Princess Beatrice to Kim Kardashian via Jennifer Lopez has inadvertently flashed a glimpse of their Spanx.

So if nothing else, Nicole, 34, is in excellent company.

The star told Closer magazine she would be pairing her control pants with a push-up bra. 'I'll be wearing Spanx and a great bra to lift up those puppies!' she said in an interview with the magazine.

'I can't wait to have Christmas with my family,' she added, saying that she would be indulging on chicken, dumplings and pecan pie. 'There's no diet then,' she says. 'I like to pig out over Christmas and work it off in January. Then I'll go running in Hyde Park and do Bikram yoga classes. I also try to cut down on salty foods and eating late at night.'

But the star, who recently admitted she suffered from bulimia while she was touring with The Pussycat Dolls in 2003, says she tries to eat healthily.

'Breakfast is boiled egg with toast, lunch is a chicken and salad wrap, dinner is wholewheat pasta or sushi.'

Nicole tells Closer that she snacks on raw nuts, bananas and sugar-free hot chocolate, and avoids alcohol apart from the occasional glass of wine with her dinner.

She keeps her weakness for crumpets, chocolate, sweets, cheese and cakes in check by enjoying them once in a while, but not over-indulging. Her rule of thumb? Don't deny yourself anything - it will only make you want it more.

And despite her fondness for a sequinned dress, Nicole plans to keep it real on Christmas Eve. Her festive outfit is a funny Christmas jumper and jeans for Christmas Eve, and comfy clothes on Christmas Day.

Her one concession to smart? She will wear a classy outfit for church on Christmas day.

'It's not a time for latex!' she jokes.

How the stars do it: Spanx are worn by everyone from Princess Beaatrice and Sienna Miller to Gwyneth Paltrow, who recently said the control pants are 'the way all the Hollywood girls do it'
