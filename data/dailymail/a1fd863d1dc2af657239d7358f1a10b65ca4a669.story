 State Hillary Rodham Clinton and former President Bill Clinton's

Supportive throughout: Dorothy Rodham, seen here with her daughter and granddaughter Chelsea on Chelsea's July 2010 wedding day, has died aged 92 after a brief illness

In a statement, the Clinton family hailed Mrs Rodham as a woman who 'overcame abandonment and hardship as a young girl to become the remarkable woman she was - a warm, generous and strong woman; an intellectual; a woman who told a great joke and always got the joke; an extraordinary friend and, most of all, a loving wife, mother and grandmother.'

Dorothy Rodham was a witness to her daughter's political victories and defeats.

She avoided the spotlight and rarely gave interviews about herself or her daughter and son-in-law, the former president, the Associated Press reports.

'A warm, generous and strong woman': The family, seen here in 2008, put out a statement remembering the beloved matriarch

A notable exception was her daughter's 2008 bid for the Democratic nomination for president.

She appeared with her daughter in primary states, particularly at events focusing on women's issues.

Mrs Clinton cited her mother in at least one ad during the campaign, saying that her mother had taught her to stand up for herself and to stand up for those who needed help.

As Mrs Clinton battled Barack Obama for the nomination in April 2008, Mrs Rodham joined her daughter and granddaughter at a campaign event at Haverford College, Pennsylvania.

Show of love: The former first lady was very protective of her mother, but Mrs Rodham 
stepped out on the campaign trail in 2007, left, and 2008, right, when her daughter ran for President

Then 88, Mrs Rodham didn't speak at 
the event, but Mrs Clinton noted that her mother lived with her and 
'always has a lot of great ideas about what we need to be doing,' 
drawing chuckles from the audience.

Bill Clinton drew similar chuckles 
when, in his 1996 Presidential acceptance speech, he said: 'Everybody 
knows there is only one person in the world who can really tell the 
truth about a man, and that's his mother-in-law.'

During one debate in 2008, Mrs Clinton
 said: 'I owe it to my mother, who never got a chance to go to college, 
who had a very difficult childhood, but who gave me a belief that I 
could do whatever I set my mind.'

Happy days: Dorothy with son Hugh, daughter Hillary and husband Hugh in the early 50s

Close knit family: Mrs Rodham held hands with son Hugh Rodham as they walked with then-President Bill Clinton in 1999 on the White House Lawn

When Mrs Clinton ended her campaign 
during a speech in June 2008 at Washington's National Building Museum, 
her mother watched from off stage and wiped a tear as Mrs Clinton 
conceded the nomination to Mr Obama.

The following February, Mrs Rodham was on hand as her daughter was sworn in as President Obama's secretary of state.

The Secretary of State was due to
 attend international conferences on cyber-security and Afghanistan but 
rushed to be at her ailing mother's side.

Sense of humor: Mrs Rodham, seen here in 2009, is also remembered as 'a woman who told a great joke and always got the joke'

Mrs Rodham rarely appeared publicly, so the 2007 presidential campaign was a big change

She was due in London today where she 
would appear alongside the UK's foreign secretary, William Hague at 
London's Conference on Cyberspace and was due to speak this afternoon.

Later this week she was expected at a 
conference will take place in Istanbul on Wednesday focusing on creating
 a regional strategy for boosting security and economic development in 
Afghanistan.

Dorothy Howell Rodham was born in Chicago in 1919, the daughter of a city firefighter.

In her autobiography, Living History, Mrs Clinton described her mother's childhood as lonely and loveless.

The Howells shuttled Dorothy and her younger sister, Isabelle, among relatives and schools.

She was eight when her parents 
divorced in 1927 and she was sent with her sister to live with their 
paternal grandparents in Alhambra, California. She made the 2,000-mile train trip alone with her younger sister.

As a schoolgirl she was banished to her bedroom for a year by her grandparents after she was caught trick-or-treating.

Her grandmother could be cruel when not ignoring young Dorothy, Mrs Clinton wrote.

Rodham left her grandparents' home at 14 when she found room and board as a mother's helper to another family.

Mrs Rodham, seen here with her daughter in 1992, has been described as Mrs Clinton 'most enduring influence'

After graduating from high school, she
 returned to Chicago on her mother's promise of helping to pay for a 
college education if she lived with her and her new husband.

After that promise was unfulfilled, Rodham supported herself with a job in an office.

'I'm still amazed at how my mother 
emerged from her lonely early life as such an affectionate and 
levelheaded woman,' Mrs Clinton wrote.

She met Hugh E. Rodham, a native of Scranton, Pennsylvania, who had found work in Chicago as a traveling salesman.

They courted for several years before marrying in 1942.

Besides their daughter, they raised two sons, Hugh and Tony.

Dorothy Rodham was a homemaker in the 
Chicago suburb of Park Ridge but for years took a variety of college 
courses even though she never completed a degree.

A Democrat, she was a counter to the conservative Republicanism of her husband, who became a successful businessman.

From the family archives: Hillary posed with her beloved mother in 1992 for a family photo in Arkansas, where Mrs Rodham had moved

The Rodhams moved to Little Rock, 
Arkansas, in 1987, to be near their daughter and her husband, then the 
state's governor, and their granddaughter, Chelsea.

Dorothy Rodham's husband died in 1993.
 A Washington Post profile in 2007 noted that she moved to Washington to
 live with her daughter's family after Hillary Clinton's election to the
 Senate in 2000.

Mrs Rodham was the last surviving parent of Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton's last living grandparent.

The nature of her illness was not released.

The Clinton family plans a private memorial service.

The family statement said any 
donations should be made to George Washington Hospital, where Mrs Rodham
 'received excellent care and made terrific friends over many years'; or
 to the Heifer Project, her Christmas gift of choice in 2010.

Or, the statement said 'to a local 
organization that helps neglected and mistreated children, a blight 
Dorothy was determined to remedy until her last day because she knew too
 well the pain too many children suffer.'

Dorothy Howell Rodham was born in Chicago on June 4, 1919 and died shortly after midnight on November 1, 2011 in Washington, D.C., surrounded by her family. Her story was a quintessentially American one, largely because she wrote it herself. She overcame abandonment and hardship as a young girl to become the remarkable woman she was — a warm, generous and strong woman; an intellectual; a woman who told a great joke and always got the joke; an extraordinary friend and, most of all, a loving wife, mother and grandmother.Dorothy is and always will be lovingly remembered by her daughter and son-in-law, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Bill Clinton; her sons and daughters-in-law, Hugh Rodham and Maria Rodham and Tony Rodham and Megan Rodham; her grandchildren, Chelsea Clinton and her husband Marc Mezvinsky, Zachary Rodham, Fiona Rodham and Simon Rodham. She leaves behind many friends from all stages and places in her life, friends from California she met in high school, friends from Little Rock and Washington with whom she explored the world, the people who were first her doctors and then became her friends at George Washington Hospital, to the people she met through her children and grandchildren who became as much her friend as theirs.To honor Dorothy, her family will hold a private celebration of her life for family and friends. In lieu of flowers and in line with what Dorothy would have wanted, the family have asked that any one who would want to do so would make a donation in Dorothy’s memory to George Washington Hospital (http://www.gwhospital.com/Donations) where she received excellent care and made terrific friends over many years; to the Heifer Project (http://www.heifer.org/), her Christmas gift of choice in 2010 and an organization dear to her heart; or to a local organization meaningful to the giver that helps neglected and mistreated children, a blight Dorothy was determined to remedy until her last day because she knew too well the pain too many children suffer. Her family is and will be forever grateful for the gift of Dorothy’s life and for the memories they will treasure forever.
