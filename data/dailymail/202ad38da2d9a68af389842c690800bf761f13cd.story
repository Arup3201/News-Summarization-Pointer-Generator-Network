More than 600,000 white British Londoners have left the capital in a decade.

Census figures show that between 2001 and 2011 the level of ‘white flight’ reached 620,000.

It is the equivalent of a city the size of Glasgow – made up entirely of white Britons – moving out of the capital.

White Britons are now a minority in the country's capital with 620,000 leaving in a decade

The figures, reported by the BBC 
yesterday, mean that for the first time, white Britons are now in a 
minority in the country’s largest city.

At the same time, the census shows, 
some rural areas have seen a rise in the proportion of people who 
describe their ethnicity as ‘white British’.

Some 3.7million Londoners classified 
themselves as white British in 2011 – down from 4.3million in 2001 – 
despite the city’s population increasing by nearly one million over the 
decade to 8.2million.

Sir Andrew Green of MigrationWatch thinks that the BBC should have addressed such a serious issue less trivially

White Britons now make up 45 per cent of the population, compared with 58 per cent in 2001.

London’s population has been boosted by immigrants. Three million foreign-born people now live in the capital.

Five London boroughs saw the 
proportion of white Britons fall by more than a quarter. The largest 
decline was in Newham, East London, where the decrease was 37.5 per 
cent.

In Barking and Dagenham, on the East 
London/Essex border, 80 per cent of residents were white British in 2001
 but by 2011 the proportion was 49 per cent.

There were also big falls in 
Redbridge, Harrow, Brent, Enfield, Ealing and Waltham Forest. The BBC 
website was criticised by readers for its depiction of the change as a 
‘story of success’ in which many white Britons had moved out to live by 
the sea or in the countryside.

Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the 
MigrationWatch think-tank, said: ‘The BBC make a very serious mistake in
 addressing an issue of such importance to the British public in such a 
trivial and superficial manner.

‘It’s surely obvious that the main 
reason for white flight is because people are not willing to live in an 
environment which has changed beyond recognition and against their own 
wishes.’

Ralph Baldwin, a Tory councillor in Barking and Dagenham, said: ‘I think people left for a variety of reasons.

‘If you look back to the early 2000s 
many people were able to retire to Clacton-on-Sea and they saw their 
friends going and followed.

‘But people also watched all this 
demographic change going on between 2000 and 2010 and they thought, “We 
don’t know where we are living any more”.

‘One day they are in a place that they think is Essex and then they are living in another place. 
‘It has never been an issue of race. It’s about the inability of people 
to affect change. The world was changing around them and they couldn’t 
do anything about it.’

Behind white Britons, the largest 
ethnic group in London is now Asians – including those born here and 
those arriving from overseas – who make up 18 per cent of the 
population.

Black Londoners – including Africans, black Britons and those from the Caribbean – make up 13 per cent.

The census shows the proportion of white Britons in South Derbyshire went up by 13.7 per cent over the decade.

Other rural boroughs that saw big 
increases included North Kesteven and West Lindsey in Lincolnshire, 
Uttlesford in Essex, East Northamptonshire, East Cambridgeshire, Mid 
Suffolk, South Norfolk, Mid Devon and Forest Heath in Suffolk.

The census shows the population of 
England and Wales was swollen by nearly four million immigrants in a 
decade of sweeping social change.

In 2011 there were 7.5million people who were born abroad living here, of whom more than half had arrived since 2001.
