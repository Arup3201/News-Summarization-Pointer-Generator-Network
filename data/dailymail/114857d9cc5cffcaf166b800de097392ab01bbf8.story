A former daycare worker in Illinois convicted of murder in the shaking death a 14-month-old girl who was in her care was ordered released from prison on Monday as the court tries to sort out her 'substantial' claims that she is innocent.

Jennifer Del Prete, 43, has been in prison for nearly a decade after she was found guilty of first-degree murder in the 2003 death of Isabella Zielinski, who was only four months old when Del Prete allegedly shook her. The girl died 10 months later.

U.S. District Judge Matthew Kennelly acknowledged in his ruling that it's rare to release someone from custody who already has been convicted - even as they wait on an appeal of their original conviction.

Doubt: New evidence casts doubt on the guilt of Jennifer Del Prete in the shaking death of a 4-month-old girl

However, in Del Prete's case, new evidence has been presented that calls into question the science in diagnosing 'shaken baby syndrome' - which is what helped prosecutors convict her in the first place.

According to the Chicago Tribune, the judge ruled that based on the new evidence, 'no reasonable juror' would convict Del Prete of first degree murder, and that the evidence is so compelling that he is taking the unusual step of releasing Del Prete on bond as her appeal in state court is pending, which could take years.

'Del Prete should not have to wait in custody for this claim to be exhausted in the state courts,' Kennelly said.

Del Prete, who has two children of her own - ages 23 and 16 - was sentenced to 20 years in prison for murdering Zielinski.

The day of the alleged shaking, Del Prete noticed the baby wasn't breathing and got 'panicky,' she told police.Del Prete called 9-1-1 and performed CPR on the girl. She admits that she may have shaken Zielinski gently to try and get her to wake up.

'I remember holding her and she doesn't wake up,' Del Prete told MyFoxChicago in a 2013 interview. 'I picked her up like this and said her name, â€˜Isabella, Isabella' because she was limp. She seemed limp.'

The baby would never again regain consciousness and died 10 months later.

Much of the prosecution's case relied on the testimony of a pediatrician who determined that the injuries the girl suffered could only have been suffered on the day she was left with Del Prete. The judge ruled that the doctor ignored evidence that showed the girl suffered an unexplained brain injury days earlier.

Additionally, Judge Kennelly referred to a
 memo written by the lead detective investigating the baby's death who 
worried that the pathologist who conducted the autopsy didn't believe 
the baby had suffered shaken baby syndrome - a fact that would hurt the 
prosecution's case against Del Prete.

New evidence shows that there is nothing to support the prosecution's theory that the only time the baby could have been injured was while she was in Del Prete's care

Some of the new evidence was discovered by students involved in the Medill Justice Project at Northwestern University.

Kennelly said in his decision that he feels the new evidence gives Del Prete a good chance at winning her appeal.

'The scientific basis for the prosecution's testimony is indeed highly suspect,' Kennelly wrote.
