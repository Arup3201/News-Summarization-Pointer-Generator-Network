The price of a box of condoms has rocketed to £500 in Venezuela after an oil price slump led to sky-high inflation.

The dire economic situation has led to shortages of basic supplies at supermarkets and protests on the streets - and now Venezuelans are struggling to get hold of contraception.

With less condoms and birth control pills on the shelves, the price of protection still available has shot up, with boxes now costing 85 per cent of the average monthly salary in the South American nation.

CNN visited eight pharmacies in Caracas, finding that half did not stock condoms at all, while the other four had limited availability.

Yuraima Bacher, a pharmacy manager, said: 'Can you believe it? It's been two weeks [since the last delivery of condoms]. Things have been slow since early January, and it's been the same thing so far this month,' Bacher said.

Venezuelans have been forced to buy their contraception online, taking to Mercado Libre - a similar website to eBay - to purchase protection.

One seller is offering boxes of 36 condoms for 4,760 bolivars - equivalent to just under £500. The average salary is around £590 a month.

President Nicolas Maduro has been unable to meet demand for condoms despite having a new factory built

President Nicolas Maduro, who has been criticised for the county's 60 per cent rate of inflation, announced in June that the government was building a condom factory.

Despite following through on his promise, consumers have complained that the contraceptives are not of good enough quality and supply is not meeting demand.

Magdymar Leon, from the Venezuelan Association for an Alternative Sexual Education, said the lack of condoms could have lead to an increase in sexually transmitted infections.

He said: 'What are the implications? One is that the individual doesn't have the means to control a decision to have children or not. That right is lost. 

'On the other hand, the ability to protect oneself from sexually transmitted diseases is also lost.'

Venezuela has one of the highest pregnancy rates in Latin America and has a 0.6 per cent HIV infection rate.

In recent weeks, protests have gripped Caracas and opposition leaders have called for snap elections to tackle the crisis.

Two top executives at Venezuela's largest drugstore were this week arrested as part of an investigation into what authorities say are illegal practices contributing to the country's chronic shortages.

The attorney general's office says it detained Farmatodo executive president Pedro Angarita and vice president Agustin Alvarez over the weekend, and formally charged them on Wednesday with working to destabilise the country.

Farmatodo said earlier this week that its actions are transparent and that its 167 stores nationwide have been inspected numerous times in recent months by the government.

President  Maduro has blasted owners of major retail chains that he accuses of conspiring with opponents to wage an 'economic war' against his socialist government.
