Killer heels, soft music, expensive hair, lots of champagne.

At first glance, this crowd of good-looking women seem to be on a rather glamorous girls' night out, swapping stories about work, kids and husbands. 

But around 10pm the first party game gets underway and it becomes apparent that this isn't your standard ladies' night.

Skirt Club is the UK's first women-only sex club for straight girls

After stripping to her knickers, one guest takes her place on the dining table. A line of salt is poured up each of her thighs, a shot glass of tequila placed on her belly and a wedge of lemon in her mouth. 

Volunteers are requested to slam the spirit, and soon a line of tipsy, frisky women has formed - wedding rings flashing - and Body Tequila is underway. 

Some neck the tequila, most spend a lot longer working their way up the stranger's body, inviting their new friends to join them before disappearing off to bedrooms to carry on the party.

Welcome to Skirt Club, the UK's first women-only sex club for straight girls.

It is cool to be a 'lipstick lesbian' right now, with model-of-the-moment Cara Delevingne, 22, becoming the poster girl for bi-curious women after her relationship with 36-year-old actress Michelle Rodriguez earlier this year.

Glamorous stars Angelina Jolie, 39, Amber Heard, 28, Lady Gaga, 28, and Azealia Banks, 23, have all admitted to relationships with women in the past and research shows that more and more straight women are keen to experiment sexually with girls.

All Skirt Club members (some pictured here) have to be vetted by founder Geneviève LeJeune

Skirt Club is the brainchild of Geneviève LeJeune*, a marketing executive and sexually adventurous thirty-something who found London's existing swinging parties a big turn off when her and a long-term boyfriend decided to give them a whirl.

Geneviève, 34, says: 'I tried the current elite sex parties but my partner and I both found they were easily dominated by men , often drunk and lecherous. It appeared women were there primarily to please their partners. I wanted something different. Something more glamorous, and where women really were calling all the shots so I decided to try it with a small group of interested friends, and remove men from the equation entirely.

'I have learned that most women are attracted to women, it doesn't mean that they are gay. It’s the fluid nature of today’s sexuality. Most of our members are married or have long-term partners, and Skirt Club is a place for them to have a wild night playing with other like-minded girls before going back to their grown-up lives.'

Most members are high-flying career women (this picture posed by models) and Geneviève claims that the club is for sexual deviants who like to play above board

The club celebrated its first birthday last month and from a small group of frisky friends the membership has grown to a community of several hundred well-heeled women who attend parties and events as well as chat through the club's website. 

Geneviève claims that the club's success is down to its commitment to exclusivity. The monthly sex soirees are held in high-end penthouse apartments in London's trendy Shoreditch neighbourhood, and, like all the best clubs, Skirt Club has strict membership criteria. 

'It's free to join, but all applicants have to be personally recommended by an existing member, and - probably more importantly - they have to be hot, very hot.

She says: 'Our members are generally very glamorous, professional city women. They expect a certain level of prestige at events - drinks, design, entertainment all has to be the very best - and they also expect a certain level of women to play with. They want to party with people like themselves so being attractive is crucial.'

Isn't that terribly shallow? 'Possibly,' she says. 'But it's no different than checking someone out in a bar or choosing a Tinder date based on a picture. Plus there's actually more to the application process, including a questionnaire and personal meeting. We are after women with brains as well as brilliant bodies.'

As head of the membership committee Geneviève will quiz potential members on their lifestyle, education and sexual leanings. She is keen to point out that a Skirt Club party is not a place to find your soul mate: 'For many people it's a once-in-a-lifetime "let’s check this one off the bucket list" experience before going back to their husbands. Gay women are welcome to apply, but they probably won't meet the love of their life.'

At the monthly events a strict dress code is enforced and sexy lingerie is a must for any party-goers. 

'Once we had a student member arrive in ugly Primark pants,' says Geneviève, 'I told her "they go or you do," the knickers came off and she stayed and had a lot of fun,'

Aside from the posh pants and no camera policy, guests claim that anything else goes as the lights dim. Body Tequila tends to break the ice and the women are quick to start making use of the venue as clothes start disappearing and the bedrooms and bubble bath gets busy.

Events take place at luxury penthouses in London's trendy Shoreditch area

'Guests can get as involved - or not - as they want,' says Geneviève, who as hostess claims not to get too involved herself. 

'Some choose to watch, some end up snogging all night in the corner, and lots end up trying all kinds of things they have never done before. The parties are supposed to finish at 2am but we're often still going as the sun comes up.'

The success of Skirt Club in London has led to interest from women (and investors) around the world, especially NYC, Toronto and Miami, where Geneviève has plans to launch new clubs in 2015.

She says: 'We're already having to think about bigger venues to cope with demand here in London, and I would love to see Skirt Club evolve into a global community.

'Women are getting more adventurous, and more confident about asking for what they want. We love men but sometimes they just aren't enough, and Skirt Club is here to fix that.'

Danielle Smith*, 38, is an executive PA in London. She is a married mother-of-one and has been to three Skirt Club parties.

She says: 'When I arrived at my first party I was greeted at the door by Geneviève and ushered into the lounge area where there were lots of beautiful women having cocktails and talking, it was all very civilised. Everyone was really friendly and there was an excitement in the air, a kind of nervous tension. People knew they were there for a good time and that it could get cheeky.

'I didn't expect people to be so approachable and interested in what I did, but I guess that's women for you. We like to talk and we like to flirt.

'You need an icebreaker at any event and after a wonderful burlesque performance there was a guest speaker talking about the difference between orgasming and climaxing (I didn't even know there was one) and this cheeky entertainment escalated the sexual tension. 'The evening had a very natural progression though. Things don't really kick off until after midnight. Women need foreplay don't we? We need to be warmed up.

'After the speaker some ladies continued with conversations, some went off to the bedrooms and some stayed in the lounge where we some fun tequila body shots. If you wanted to watch then that was fine, or if you wanted to do more then that was fine as well.

Skirt Club allows women to explore their sexuality without performing for a man, claims one member

'At one point I went to the bathroom in the bedroom and as I walked by there were two girls on the bed having a grand old time. I thought: "I could join in, or I could watch, or I could just leave them to it," I decided to stay and watch and it was very hot. Later I did get involved in some heavy petting with one girl, then left the party by myself around 2am.

'I would say most women there were straight. Some had partners who were supportive of them going, some ladies were there without their partners knowing. They wanted a safe environment that they could experiment in and know that they were not being looked upon or judged.

'I came away and told my husband all about my adventures and he reacted very well but we have a very strong relationship and are very happy with each other.

'We have been to Torture Garden and another sex club together but Skirt Club is different. When you take the male element out it seems a lot more about you and what you want. You're getting to explore your female sexuality 100 per cent without having to perform for a male watching.

'There's no photography so everyone's identity is kept anonymous and I think that's very important. It means we are more likely to take risks and explore. What happens in skirt club stays in Skirt Club and that's what keeps us coming back for more.'
