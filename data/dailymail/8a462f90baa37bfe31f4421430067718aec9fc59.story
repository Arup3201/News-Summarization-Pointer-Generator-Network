A historic 3.7-acre plot of prime property near the gateway to the Village of East Hampton is about to go on the market for the first time in 300 years.

The residential and agricultural property, known as the Gardiner Home Lot, near Town Pond was claimed in 1648 by Lion G. Gardiner, an adventurer who put down roots on the 33,000-acre Gardiners Island in 1640.

The asking price is $12.95 million, the taxes are $10,604 a year, and several small structures, including two houses, remain on the land.

Massive: The residential and agricultural property, with two houses, is being sold for $12.95 million

It is the last family-owned remnant of the original lots arranged around a mile-long common settled by private owners who made up the colony’s sole voting populace when East Hampton Village was established 365 years ago, according to the New York Times.

The seller is 71-year-old Olney Mairs Gardiner, a retired patent lawyer who inherited the land at 36 James Lane from his uncle, Winthrop Gardiner Jr., a test pilot who worked with Howard Hughes and had been married to Sonja Henie, the Olympic figure skater and movie star.

After trying to subdivide the property into three equal lots, one for each of his children, only to be dissuaded by village preservationists, Gardiner, known as Bill, decided to sell the remainder of the parcel as is, to assure their inheritance.

‘I’m 71 and the clock is ticking,’ he said. ‘I certainly had reservations about parting with it, but it’s time to put my house in order and let it go to create a fund for my children; I didn’t want to have a fire sale at my death.’

Gardiner's Mill, which sits on the property, has been renovated for $1 million. Here it is seen in 1928

Gardiner his wife, Karie, relocated to East Hampton from Florida, and from 1994 to 2007 moved into and planned the renovation of both homes — first the front house, where the kitchen and bathrooms date to the 1920s, and then the back house, which was originally a garage and servants’ quarters.

They now live nearby at 48 James Lane, in a smaller house that his grandfather had moved to from the family’s Hog Creek Farm in Three Mile Harbor.

The plot’s Gardiner Windmill, was commissioned around 1804 by James Lyon Gardiner, the seventh proprietor of Gardiners Island, and in 1996 was deeded to the village, which undertook a restoration costing nearly $1 million. 

The front house is a 2,700-square-foot five-bedroom three-bath home that dates to 1750 and can't be radically renovated or demolished

According to village lore, the property also produced a resident ghost, the daughter of a former windmill operator

According to village lore, the property also produced a resident ghost, the daughter of a former windmill operator, who haunts the adjacent South End Cemetery where Lion Gardiner and other original colonists are buried.  

The property, which lies within the Main Street Historic District, has two acres of fields deeded for agricultural/scenic use.

The 1.7-acre residential portion of the lot contains two homes: the so-called front house which is a 2,700-square-foot five-bedroom three-bath home that dates to 1750 and can’t be radically renovated or demolished.

The second is a more modern 3,500-square-foot home.

There is room for a tennis court and a pool and, on the agrarian acres, the potential for horses or artisanal farming, said Gardiner.
