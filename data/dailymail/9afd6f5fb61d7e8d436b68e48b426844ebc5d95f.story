A season of sensational firsts for jockey Paul Hanagan could end in the biggest of them all at Longchamp on Sunday afternoon.

The Warrington-born dual champion will line up for the first time in the €5million Qatar Prix de L’Arc Triomphe on 6-1 second favourite Taghrooda confident there was an explanation for her only defeat behind Tapestry in the Yorkshire Oaks in August.

The Liverpool-supporting rider will also be buoyed by a 2014 record which has seen Taghrooda provide him with wins in the Investec Oaks at Epsom and the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot on his first rides in the pair of prestigious contests.

Taghrooda would become the first filly to win the Arc and King George in the same season and a more than satisfactory gallop last week at Newmarket’s Rowley Mile racecourse has convinced Hanagan that his John Gosden-trained mount is back in prime form.

Hanagan said: ‘I never like to make excuses but she was just coming into season and that is pretty big. When I went for her she felt as if she just faltered. Newmarket did her the world of good. She rides like a colt and is built like one. It has been a wonderful season — to win the Arc would be the perfect end.’

Longchamp’s normally sparsely-populated lawns will be packed this afternoon with 60,000 spectators. About 5,000 Japanese among them will be hoping their trio — Just A Way, Gold Ship or Harp Star — can give them a first win after near-misses including second place for Orfevre for the last two years. The big worry for Hanagan, who landed the first Group One of his career at this meeting in 2010 with Richard Fahey’s Wootton Bassett in the Prix Jean-Luc Lagardere, is Taghrooda’s draw in wide stall 15. Treve won from there last year but she was the first to do so from a double-figure stall since Dalakhani (14) in 2003.

The sun shone at Longchamp yesterday and drying conditions are another negative in the argument that trainer Criquette Head-Maarek can turn around a disappointing season for 2013 winner Treve.

Whether the narrow defeat by Cirrus Des Aigles in the Prix Ganay left its mark is debatable but the filly who was 2-1 to win back-to-back Arcs immediately 12 months ago is now 11-1 after other defeats at Royal Ascot, when she was injured, and last month’s Prix Vermeille. Treve is ridden by Thierry Jarnet not Frankie Dettori, leaving the Italian to ride Prix Foy winner Ruler of the World.

But Prix Niel winner Ectot, the third of the trio of runners owned by Sheik Joaan Al Thani, looks the most likely to win under Gregory Benoist.
