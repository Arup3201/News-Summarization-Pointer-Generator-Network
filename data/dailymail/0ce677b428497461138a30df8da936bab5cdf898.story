Police officers who suffered an injury while at work have claimed as much as £85million in compensation in the last five years - including for accidents involving insect bites, potholes and falling off chairs.

The figures - which showed one individual alone received £130,000 after falling over and breaking his hip in a store room while on duty - were revealed by a Freedom of Information request made by The Sun.

The claims, which were made between 2008 and 2013, racked up at least £75million in payouts, but the total figure is thought to be anywhere up to £85m.

Payment row: Police officers claimed as much as £85m compensation for accidents while at work between 2008 and 2013 - at a time when budgets were being cut by 20%

Five forces declined to provide an answer to the FOI request.

The staggering amount paid out in compensation is revealed at a time when considerable cuts are being made to police budgets.

In recent years, the Home Office announced police funding would fall by 20 percent by 2015 and more than 10,460 officers would lose their jobs.

As a result, earlier this year it was reported that the number of police officers in England and Wales is now at the lowest level in more than a decade.

The 2.6 per cent dip in officer numbers follows a sharp reduction in funding.

There has also been a marked decline in the number of community support officers, or 
PCSOs, with current figures showing 13,552 - down six per cent in a year.

Critics have pointed out that some of the claims were more legitimate than others - and those that were frivolous should not have been accepted.

Jonathan Isaby of The Taxpayers' Alliance said: 'In some cases the reasons behind claims are frankly ridiculous and should be rejected.'

Among the compensation claims made were one for £3,300 after an officer caught his finger in a vacuum cleaner.

£130,000 for an officer who fell over and broke his hip in a store room.

£12,019 for an officer shot by a colleague in Sussex after suffering post-traumatic stress disorder.

£3,300 for an officer who caught his finger in a vacuum cleaner.

£2,000 was approved for an officer who fell off his chair.

£4,400 for an officer in Staffordshire who was given an ill-fitting protective vest.

Four-figure sums for officers who tripped in potholes.

Other claims were made for insect bites and officers who fell off their bikes.

12,700 staff and officers made claims between 2008 and 2013.

Another was given £2,000 - after falling off his chair - while four-figure sums were accepted for officers who fell in potholes.

Insect bites and falling off bikes were other injuries put forward for compensation claims, while one officer received £4,400 for an ill-fitting protective vest.

Meanwhile an officer shot accidentally by a colleague in Sussex was given £12,019 for post-traumatic stress disorder.

The majority of payouts were in Northern Ireland to officers who suffered hearing loss due to a firearms fault.

Not all claims have however been successful or been pursued.

In September 2013, PC Kelly Jones,who planned to sue the 
owner of a petrol station after tripping on a kerb while investigating a
 break-in,  dropped her claim for damages.

Ms Jones 
faced controversy after she filed a civil claim against Steve Jones, a
garage owner in Thetford, Norfolk, demanding he reimburse the income she
 lost as a result of injuries sustained at the scene.

She had filed against the owner of the Nun's 
Bridges Filling Station, claiming he failed to ensure 
she was 'reasonably safe' after responding to a reported burglary.

She allegedly fell and hurt her leg and wrist while checking the building in August 2012.

A
 month after she filed her claim Home Secretary Theresa May told the 
Police Federation’s annual conference that she wanted to see an end to 
'frivolous' legal claims.

She told delegates of the Federation, which had funded WPC Jones' legal costs: 'I know that the vast majority of you are dedicated public servants of the best kind.

'But
 when a police officer sues a member of the public because they slipped 
on private property - that is simply not the sort of attitude police 
officers should exhibit.

'I want to work with the Federation to make sure police officers don’t make frivolous claims.'

Ms Jones subsequently dropped the case, with the garage owner welcoming the move as 'a victory for common sense'.
