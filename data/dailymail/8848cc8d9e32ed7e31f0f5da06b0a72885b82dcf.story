Britain was today facing a damp and drizzly weekend - but forecasters insisted the weather will improve by the start of next week.

A beautiful sunrise was photographed today as the country woke up to the news that temperatures will not get back out of the teens until Monday.

It comes as millions of families around Britain argue about whether they should turn their central heating on even though it is only mid-September.

What a start: The sky glows orange as the sun rises on a pleasant Autumn morning in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, ahead of a warmer weekend

Good morning: The sunrise was photographed in Peterborough as the country woke up to the news that temperatures will not get back out of the teens until Monday

Tonight there will be plenty of clear spells and it will remain largely dry, with a few spots of light rain and drizzle about in parts of the North and West.

After any early fog lifts tomorrow it will be a largely dry day, although western parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland will see spots of light rain.

Saturday will be dry and bright across central and eastern parts, with cloudier skies and some patchy light rain and drizzle for western parts.

And Sunday will see variable amounts of cloud and sunny spells, with some light rain and drizzle across some western places, but staying mostly dry.

Meanwhile it was revealed yesterday that gas use last Saturday and Sunday surged by 65 per cent compared with the weekend before.

Looking ahead: After any early fog lifts tomorrow it will be a largely dry day, although western parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland will see spots of light rain

Still going for a dip: A dog shakes off water after swimming in the Autumn weather yesterday in the River Thames at Richmond, south-west London

But although it felt much colder – and some areas were hit by storms and heavy rain – temperatures were actually around the seasonal norm.

Taking the whole of September so far, readings have been only 0.25C lower than a year ago – yet gas usage has gone up by 15 per cent.

Energy chiefs described the cooler weather as a ‘faux winter’, saying the long, hot summer spoilt people and made them more susceptible to minor chills.

Today, the Environment Agency today has four flood alerts in place, for parts of the River Avon, Mersey Estuary, North Somerset coast and Swansea Bay.

Met Office forecaster Nicola Maxey told 
MailOnline: ‘Into the weekend, the west side of the country is looking 
damp and drizzly.

Going for a stroll: A man walks his dog at sunrise yesterday on Blyth beach, Northumberland. Sunday will see variable amounts of cloud and sunny spells

Faux winter: Deer are enjoying the late summer sun in Richmond Park, south-west London, but a down turn in temperatures last weekend caused energy usage to soar

'The east side is drier but still cloudier and a risk of some light rain. In temperature terms it’s getting better.

'Sunday will be improving slightly as we build into the start of Monday where it’s looking warmer again.

‘We could see the low 20s in the South next week. Monday night will see a possible frost, but we are looking at an improving picture.

‘We’ve got temperatures of around 18c on Sunday for the South and Midlands - possibly 19C as you go up into Yorkshire.’

The overnight low temperature was in the North-East at 3.3C. The highest winds today were forecast to be 15C in Northern Ireland.
