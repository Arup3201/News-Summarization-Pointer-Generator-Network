The stars were out in force at Wimbledon on Saturday afternoon to watch Petra Kvitova claim her second women's title with a 6-3, 6-0 win against Eugenie Bouchard.

Former Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard looked to have put his disappointing World Cup campaign with England behind him as he posed for pictures with his fiancee, TV presenter Christine Bleakley, before heading inside to watch the action.

Lampard wasn't the only famous sporting face down at SW19, with golf legend Jack Nicklaus spotted greeting a fellow spectator before taking his seat on Centre Court.

Double Olympic champion Dame Kelly 
Holmes was also seen making her way to Wimbledon's main court, along 
with last year's women's champion Marion Bartoli, who has been working 
as a pundit for BBC Radio 5 Live.

Hollywood actress Keira Knightley found time in her busy schedule to attend with her husband, James Righton, who is a keyboardist in the band The Klaxons.

The pair took their seats in the Royal Box, while a number of other stars of stage and screen took time out to go and watch Saturday's showpiece event.

Regular
 Wimbledon attendee Sir Cliff Richard was pictured signing 
autographs for fans before shooting off to take his seat, while newsreader Sir Trevor McDonald and popstar Peter Andre were also 
in attendance as Bouchard fell in her first Grand Slam final.

Actor Chiwetel Ejiofor, star of hit film 12 Years A Slave, and The Big Bang Theory's Jim Parsons were two more recognisable faces in the crowd as Kvitova completed her straight sets victory.

Princess Eugenie, who Bouchard was named after, took her seat in the Royal Box ahead of meeting the 20-year-old Canadian star for the first time.
