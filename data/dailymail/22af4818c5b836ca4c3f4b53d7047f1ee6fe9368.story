'Flashman': David Cameron, the Prime Minister, lost his cool with Ed Balls at Prime Minister's Questions today, calling the shadow chancellor an 'idiot'

David Cameron dismissed Ed Balls as a 'muttering idiot' after losing his temper with the shadow chancellor during a heated exchange at Prime Minister's Questions today.

The Prime Minister's unexpected outburst prompted a rebuke from Commons Speaker John Bercow, who told him to retract the slight as it was 'unparliamentary'.

And Labour benches immediately leapt on Mr Cameron's loss of composure with cries of 'Flashman' - a reference to the bully in Tom Brown’s Schooldays.

The taunt is a favourite amongst Labour MPs, who think Mr Cameron is at his weakest during PMQs when he is visibly riled and angry.

Sources close to Mr Balls claimed it was the shadow chancellor’s demands for Mr Cameron to 'tell us about the recession' that tipped the Prime Minister over the edge.

But according to MPs and political pundits on Twitter, Mr Balls sent the Prime Minister in to a spin by telling him to 'chillax, and have another glass of wine'.

The jibe is a reference to a recently published book which claims Mr Cameron unwinds from the stresses of his job by drinking three or four glasses of wine with Sunday lunch.

By the time it came to a Commons statement on the G8 and Nato summit in Chicago, Mr Cameron was in a conciliatory mood and volunteered an apology to Dennis Skinner, the veteran MP Labour, who he urged to retire during a heated Commons exchange last month.

The barbed remark prompted accusations of 'ageism' against Mr Cameron. Today he admitted his remark was 'sharp' and insisted Mr Skinner was a 'tremendous ornament' in the Commons.

To make matters worse for the PM, former chancellor Lord Lamont, to whom he was a special adviser when Britain crashed out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992, told the BBC’s World at One that Mr Cameron could be 'quite volatile'.

Mr Cameron’s initial misdemeanour in PMQs was unexpected, he had only begun to answer a seemingly innocuous question on the Government’s economic record.

Is David Cameron too 'chillaxed' to run the country?

He said: 'What we need to do both in Britain and Europe is to combine deficit reduction, which has given us the low interest rates, with an active monetary policy, with structural reforms to make us competitive, and with innovative ways of using our hard-won credibility, which we wouldn’t have if we listened to the muttering idiot sitting opposite me.'

After the Speaker's rebuke the PM replied that he would replace the word 'idiot' with the words 'the man who left us with this enormous deficit and this financial crisis'.

Speaking outside the Commons, a Labour source said: 'The Prime Minister is increasingly losing his temper and increasingly losing the House of Commons, because he is increasingly losing the economic argument.

'It is deeply un-prime ministerial and a sign of his weakness on the key economic argument.'
