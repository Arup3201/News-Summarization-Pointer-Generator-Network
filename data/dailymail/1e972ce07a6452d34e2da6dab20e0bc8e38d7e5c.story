Colonel Gaddafi’s fugitive son Saif al-Islam is trying to reach a safe haven in Zimbabwe while also negotiating to surrender, officials said yesterday.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague confirmed it was in ‘indirect’ talks with the London-educated playboy.

Saif, 39 - who was Gaddafi’s heir apparent - has been indicted for war crimes and is on the run in the Sahara desert.

He has laid down conditions for handing himself in for trial, including being found a safe country to live in if he is acquitted or after serving a prison sentence.

But double-dealing Saif is also in talks with mercenaries willing to find him a safe haven under the protection of another African despot such as Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe.

‘We are having informal conversations with Saif Gaddafi in order to see if he can be surrendered to the court,’ Luis Moreno-Ocampo, chief prosecutor of the ICC, said in The Netherlands yesterday.

But he said Saif was also trying to reach a country that did not cooperate with handing over suspects to the ICC.

‘We know he has a different option, because apparently there is a group of mercenaries willing to move him to a country, probably Zimbabwe,’ the prosecutor said. Some of the mercenaries may be from South Africa, he said.

He said the court was urging other countries to prevent Saif’s escape by denying any plane carrying him permission to fly through their air space.

Will he put his hands up? Saif al-Islam went on TV in August (above) to declare he would not surrender. He is wanted on charges of inciting crowds to murder during the early stages of the Libyan revolution

He said Saif – who would use any trial to grandstand about his relationships with Western leaders such as Tony Blair and Lord Mandelson – was making all sorts of demands.

He was pressing for clarifications about his fate should he be acquitted, said Mr Moreno-Ocampo, who said he has made it clear to the fugitive that he could ask the judges to send him to a country other than Libya.

‘He says he is innocent and he will prove his innocence,’ said the prosecutor.

Saif is deep in the desert, believed to have crossed from Libya to Niger with escorts from Toureg herdsmen. Niger has said it would hand him over to the ICC, so Saif is unlikely to stay there long.

His co-fugitive, Libya’s former intelligence chief Abdullah Senussi, made the same journey a day earlier and ended up in eastern Mali, near Timbuktoo. But Mali’s Foreign Minister Soumeylou Boubeye Maiga said yesterday: ‘Mali will respect its obligations in relation to the International Criminal Court. We are absolutely clear on that.’

In Libya, new Justice Minister Mohammed al-Lagi told the Daily Mail last night: ‘If Saif is captured in Libya, he will be tried in Libya.’
