Who is he? Poster appealing for information about nineteenth-century serial killer Jack The Ripper. He has now been identified as an Essex doctor

British serial killer Jack the Ripper has been identified as an Essex doctor called Stephen Herbert Appleford - by a Uruguayan mathematician who has never set foot in London.

Eduardo Cuitiño says two years of painstaking research has uncovered what Scotland Yard has failed to do since 1888 - in naming the man who murdered at least five prostitutes that year in the capital's East End.

The Professor of Statistics at the University ORT of Montevideo said Appleford was a surgeon working in the London Hospital of Whitechapel - the area where the victims died.

He claims he was around 36-years-old, what he deemed 'the appropriate age of a psychopath', and had an IQ well above average, another trait common in that type of criminal.

Appleford was from the Essex town of Coggeshall, where Cuitiño said residents were famed as being 'stupid', which may have turned him into a social outcast.

Despite later marrying, he was at the time of the murders 'single, without children and living crammed into a house with his sisters'. He also had 'great physical strength' because at university he competed in rowing and swimming.

According to Cuitiño, Appleford started to commit his crimes after the death of his mother, to whom he was very close, in 1881.

A year later there was an attempted murder on a woman which the Uruguayan attributes to the Ripper, and therefore Appleford.

She was found stabbed in the back, the surgeon was close by and, after being identified as a doctor, was called to help her.

He later produced a report in which he claimed that he had injured herself. Appleford was also left-handed, according to Cuitiño, 'just like the killer, who cut throats from right to left'.

This, he said, was concluded from analysis of the doctor's handwriting obtained from a digital census record signed in the early 20th century.

Cuitiño said he used Google Maps 'to develop a geometric theory' around the crimes, especially the two committed the night of September 30, 1888.

The mathematician also pointed to an article the doctor published in the British Medical Journal British Medical Journal about a small case to carry medical knives which could be concealed about the body.

ROBERT MANN: Historian
 Mei Trow points the finger at mortuary attendant Robert Mann. He was 
well educated in anatomy, lived locally and came from a poor background.
 The first two victims, Polly Nichols and Annie Chapman, are known to 
have been delivered to his mortuary.

PRINCE ALBERT VICTOR: He
 killed the women after being driven insane by syphilis, according to an
 article in The Criminologist in 1970 by Dr Thomas E A Stowell.
  
  MONTAGUE JOHN DRUITT: Druitt
 was a barrister who came under suspicion because he committed suicide 
just after the final murder. However, he lived in Kent – and most Ripper
 experts believe the suspect was local to Whitechapel.

DR THOMAS NEILL CREAM: Cream,
 a doctor specialising in abortions, was hanged in 1892 for several 
murders he committed in London and his last words were reportedly ‘I am 
Jack…’.

This, Cuitiño thinks, was a way of poking fun at the police, reports Spanish newspaper El Pais.

Appleford died on August 31, the same date as the first crime, in 1940 when he was 88-years-old the year corresponding to 1888 - the year of the murders.

Cuitiño added: 'He probably committed suicide, laughing at England and the English until his last sign of life.'

Cuitiño
 has admitted there may be a degree of speculation as to his claims, 
published in an essay called Travelling through time to trap Jack the 
Ripper, seeing as he lives 11,000 km away from London and has never set 
foot in the city.

But the 
38-year-old said: 'My interest is to link the history of mathematics, I 
try to give a mathematical approach to the riddles and mysteries'

And
 to reach his conclusion, he said he spent two years analysing the 
geographical locations of the crimes on a series of computer simulators,
 and using information garnered online.

The Ripper struck five times during a blood-soaked ten weeks in 1888.

The
 victims - Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine 
Eddowes and Mary Jane Kelly - were all East End prostitutes. Three had 
their wombs removed.
