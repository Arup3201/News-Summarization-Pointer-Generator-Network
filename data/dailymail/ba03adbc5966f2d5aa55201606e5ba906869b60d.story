She turned 40 this year and is looking better than ever. So what's Kate Moss' secret?

The supermodel, who has dominated the industry for 25 years, has revealed that she's the latest in a long line of celebrities to jump on the health bandwagon.

Speaking about her virtuous new lifestyle, she said: 'I like juicing as it gives you bright eyes with a bit of a twinkle and it keeps your hair shiny.'

What's her secret? Kate Moss, 40, who has dominated the industry for 25 years, has revealed that she's a huge fan of juicing and loves one supplement in particular 

But you won't catch her whizzing up some banana and spinach in her blender. Kate, who makes around £12 million a year, adds a £98 superfood supplement into her morning juice created by health aficionado and fellow supermodel, Elle Macpherson.

Kate explained: 'At the moment I'm using Elle Macpherson The Super Elixir supplement. I add it to my juices.'

Kate is the latest in a long line of celebrities to confess their love of the product - fellow socialites Nick Grimshaw and Daisy Lowe love it too.

So what is all the fuss about? Like fellow models Miranda Kerr and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Elle swears by the power of all things green and she is so convinced by their potency, that she unveiled her very own brand. 

Secret weapon: Kate loves Elle Macpherson's Super Elixir, which is packed with 45 key ingredients including alkalising super greens, Chinese herbs, and the miatake mushroom

Elle this year introduced The Super Elixir by WelleCo, a range of alkalising food supplements, which she describes as her drug.

The product was formulated over many years especially for Elle by Dr Simone Laubscher PhD, a Harley Street nutritional doctor specialising in disease prevention.

The powder, which can be sprinkled over salads or mixed into juices and smoothies, claims to support healthy nutrition and ensure your body is working to its optimum function. 

Speaking about the inspiration behind her new range, Elle told MailOnline: 'I'm on the run a lot and if I'm not nourished, I don't feel good.

'For years, I was taking vitamins and powders. I tried alternative medicine, acupuncture, reflexology.

'I'm a pescatarian, I don't drink, do drugs or smoke so what else can I do? I wasn't unaware of wellness but something wasn't working for me and I told my doctor "I don't feel great".

'She told me my body was acidic, it was down to stress, travel and lack of sleep.'

That's when Elle decided to create the Super Elixir. The product is designed to support healthy nutrition at a cellular level and aid the digestive, endocrine (hormonal), circulatory and nervous systems.

Work hard, play hard: The model, who makes around £12 million a year starring in campaigns for brands including Dior, Yves Saint Laurent and Burberry, is known for her love of a good time

Packed with 45 key ingredients including alkalising super greens, Chinese herbs, and the miatake mushroom, Elle claims that just 10g of the powder daily contains all the vitamins, minerals and trace elements to assist wellness and vitality.

'I've spent years tweaking it and refining it and now the recipe works so beautifully. After a few weeks, my body went into cruise mode and I felt uplifted, lost weight, didn't get sick and didn't crave sugar.

'My body hummed along and functioned properly,' said Elle.

It seems that it's helping Kate's hum along too; the model's career - and social life - is going stronger than ever. 

The model makes around £12 million a year starring in campaigns for brands including Dior, Yves Saint Laurent and Burberry.
