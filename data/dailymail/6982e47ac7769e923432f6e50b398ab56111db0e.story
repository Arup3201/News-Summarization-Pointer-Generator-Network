Shamed cyclist Lance Armstrong's 'drugs' confession to Oprah will not end in criminal charges but could cost him tens of millions of dollars in civil lawsuits, experts warned today.

Armstrong, whose fortune is estimated to be around $100milllion, was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles last year and banned for life after the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) ruled he had been at the heart of 'the most sophisticated, professionalised and successful doping programme that sport has ever seen'.

But now a string of sporting bodies are lining up to demand he pay back millions of dollars he has won in prize and bonus money over his career in the wake of his sensational 'doping' admission to be aired this week.

'At the end of the day, I would be 
surprised if the damages - total amount - aren’t in the tens of millions
of dollars,' Andrew Stoltmann, a Chicago lawyer who has represented 
professional athletes in civil cases, told NBC News.

Lawyers even warned that defamation actions by critics he viciously attacked when denying the claims are also possible.

Already the organisation that runs the Tour de 
France has demanded that Armstrong pay back almost $4million it 
awarded him for his wins, while insurance firm SCA Promotions wants back $12million in bonus payouts it covered in 2002, 2003 and 2005.

The London-based Sunday Times also is suing Armstrong to recover about $500,000 it paid him to settle a libel lawsuit.

Even the 
Australian government has asked Armstrong to return millions in 
appearance fees paid when he raced in the Tour Down Under.

Refunds: Armstrong's admission could now lead to a string of lawsuits demanding refunds of the millions he has won over his career in prize and bonus money, while potential defamation actions by critics he viciously attacked are also possible

Federal authorities have closed their 20-month probe for possible criminal charges over the doping allegations after investigators unearthed no illegal practice.

While taking performance-enhancing drugs is not a criminal offence, they may have been looking for evidence of trafficking, fraud and perjury, NBC News reported.

But experts suggest that that investigation could be re-opened in the wake of Armstrong's explosive interview on Oprah.

Wayne Lamprey, a former federal 
prosecutor now in private practice in San Francisco, told NBC: 'Mr. Armstrong is very well-advised by capable lawyers and I don’t think
he would be admitting on the Oprah Winfrey show something that would 
give rise to a criminal charge.'

The USADA deposed 11 
former teammates and accused Armstrong of masterminding a complex and 
brazen drug program that included steroids, blood boosters and a range 
of other performance-enhancers.

A Justice Department official told NBC News that some lawyers in the civil
division want the government to join a whistleblower lawsuit
filed in 2010, which is currently under seal.

Former
teammate Floyd Landis, who was stripped of the 2006 Tour de France 
title for doping, has filed a federal whistle-blower lawsuit that 
accused Armstrong of defrauding the U.S. Postal Service, which sponsored the team and paid out $30million 
in fees. 

If successful, the suit could force Armstrong, and others, to repay that money plus $60 million in damages, 30 per cent of which would go to Landis.

It comes after the World Anti-Doping Agency yesterday said that Armstrong must confess under oath to seek a reduction in his lifetime ban from sports for taking performance enhancing drugs during seven Tour de France victories.

WADA says it 'read with interest media reports suggesting a television 'confession' made by Lance Armstrong' to talk show host Oprah Winfrey on Monday.

Armstrong reportedly hopes to return to competition in recognised triathlon events.

However, WADA says 'only when Mr Armstrong makes a full confession under oath — and tells the anti-doping authorities all he knows about doping activities — can any legal and proper process for him to seek any reopening or reconsideration of his lifetime ban commence'.

Sneak preview: 'I think he answered my questions 
satisfactorily. He was thoughtful and serious and had prepared himself 
for this moment and at the end of it we were both pretty exhausted'

The agency says athletes must pass on details of performance-enhancing drug use 'to the relevant anti-doping authorities'.

The announcement came after Oprah revealed 
she was surprised and mesmerised by some of Lance Armstrong's answers 
during her grueling two-hour interview with the shamed cyclist, in which
he finally confessed.

Speaking to CBS yesterday morning about the 'intense and emotional' interview that took place in Austin yesterday, she said: 'He did not come clean in the manner I expected, I was surprised. Myself and the 
whole team were mesmerised and riveted by some of his answers. 

July 23, 2001: 'I've lived by the rules. You think someone with my health history would take something like that? There's no way.'

July 26, 2002: 'Immediately [the doping probe] knew the evidence was clean, but they kept the case open...there's nothing there.'

August 25, 2005: 'I have never doped. I can say that again but Ive said it for seven years.'

'Unfortunately, the witch hunt continues. This article is nothing short of tabloid journalism. [I have] never taken performance-enhancing drugs.'

November 30, 2005: 'Having never taken performance-enhancing drugs, when I pissed in the bottle, there was no drugs in that piss.'

June 24, 2009: 'I have no regrets at all. I've got no reason to lie.'

May 2010: 'We have nothing to hide. We have nothing to run from. I can give you one word to sum this all up. It’s credibility.'

July 2010: 'As long as I live, I will deny it. There was absolutely no way I forced people, encouraged people, told people, helped people, facilitated. Absolutely not. One hundred percent…I mean, I can’t control what other riders do.'

June 2012: 'I have never doped, and, unlike many of my accusers, I have competed as an endurance athlete for 25 years with no spike in performance, passed more than 500 drug tests and never failed one. These charges are baseless [and] motivated by spite.'

'I
think he answered my questions satisfactorily. He was thoughtful and 
serious and had prepared himself for this moment and at the end of it we
were both pretty exhausted. 

'I had a strategy and I went in prepared to have to dig and pull but he was very forthcoming with his answers.'

Winfrey
went on to say that she would leave it to others to decide if the 
former champion was contrite during the interview, but that she thought 
he was well-prepared and serious throughout.

It was also revealed yesterday that
Armstrong hinted to the fact the use of drugs within the sport is 
widespread in a meeting with the head of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency last month.

Armstrong is said to have spoken openly to Travis 
Tygart about doping, claiming it was 
rampant in all sports, especially NBA football, and that he was being singled out for punishment.

Sources said that at the end of the 
meeting, during which Tygart refused to soften Armstrong's lifetime ban 
for what the agency called the 'most sophisticated doping program on the
planet', he told him: 'You don't hold the keys to my redemption.

'There's one person who holds the keys to my redemption and that's me,' the source told the Wall Street Journal.

This week, Armstrong begins a public 
campaign to restore his shattered image, which started yesterday with 
his no-holds-barred interview with Oprah Winfrey and his tearful apology
to staff at his cancer foundation Livestrong.

Armstrong's lawyers were against the meeting but he went ahead with it anyway.

The highly charged conversation took 
place in a conference room near the Denver Airport. Tygart told the 
cyclist he had multiple chances to come clean and that it was too late 
for any redemption.

The meeting ended with Armstrong 
swearing at him and saying he would compete in unsanctioned races, 
before walking out, according to the Wall Street Journal.

In yesterday's interview, which will 
be aired on Thursday, Armstrong confessed to the chat show queen his 
involvement in the doping scandal which stripped him of all seven Tour titles last year.

The voluminous U.S. Anti-Doping 
Agency report portrayed him as a ruthless competitor, willing to go to 
any lengths to win the prestigious race and said he made threats and 
accusations against anyone on the team who told the truth about doping.

In the interview, Armstrong only talks about himself and does not get into specifics, according to sources.

A group of about ten close friends and
advisers to Armstrong left a downtown Austin hotel about three hours 
after they arrived on Monday afternoon for the taping of the interview.
