Wayne Rooney is ready to sign his new mega deal at Manchester United - so it's little wonder he was all smiles at training on Friday morning before catching the train to London for Saturday's game with Crystal Palace.

The striker will pen a five-and-a-half-year contract at Old Trafford, which should keep him at the club for the remainder of his career.

Sportsmail revealed on Thursday that the finer details of the deal had been sorted but image rights issues were holding up confirmation.

But that has been rectified and the deal 
will be announced imminently, with Rooney earning £300,000-a-week.

In
 re-signing, he presents a major coup for David Moyes.

It had looked as if the 28-year-old would be leaving for pastures new last summer, with Chelsea keen to land the England man.

But Moyes stood firm and has cajoled some of the player's best performances in a red shirt over the last few months.

He has been the only United forward to have consistently hit the net throughout a campaign that hasn't gone according to plan.

Rooney was in high spirits, and so too were his under-fire team-mates.

You'd
 be forgiven for thinking Carrington would be a place for hard graft in a
 bid to arrest a catastrophic Manchester United campaign.

But
 the training ground looked an altogether chirpier place, with players laughing and joking ahead of their trip to Crystal
 Palace.

Moyes has endured a difficult start to life as Reds boss, with United languishing seventh in the Premier League.

They've only won one of the last five league games, including an embarrassing 2-1 defeat at Stoke City.

The
 alarming slump - that had looked like picking up before New Year - 
hasn't stopped Carrington being a hive of joviality though; the news of Rooney's impending contract can only have boosted morale.

Shinji
 Kagawa, Robin van Persie and Juan Mata were all snapped sharing a joke 
as Moyes attempts to relieve the sort of mounting pressure which looks 
to have derailed their campaign.
