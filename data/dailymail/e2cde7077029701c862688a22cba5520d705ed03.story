Retired Australian Formula One driver Mark Webber has reportedly escaped injury after a high-speed crash in Brazil that saw his Porsche 919 burst into flames after he hit a wall.  

The 38-year-old was involved in a fiery accident in the last hour of a six hour World Endurance Championship race in Interlagos, São Paulo, on Monday.

A statement on Twitter from the FIA World Endurance Championship said: 'Webber is "awake and alert" in Medical centre.'

His Porsche 919 collided with Italian driver Matteo Cressoni, who was driving the number 90 Ferrari 458 of 8 Star Motorsports, and then hit the wall.

Cressoni has also been examined after the crash and is OK.

The racing branch of Porsche tweeted: 'Heavy crash for @AussieGrit in #porsche919hybrid no 20. Driver is ok.'

The former Red Bull driver, who had qualified in pole position for the race, signalled to cameras with a thumbs-up that he was fine as he was being carried away on a stretcher.

The dramatic crash happened as Webber approached the 300km/h-plus Arquibancadas curve.  

British Formula One driver Jenson Button said: 'Glad to see @AussieGrit is ok after his shunt at Interlagos @fiawec, that was a big one matey.'

Retired British racing driver Dario Franchitti wrote: 'Very glad my mate @AussieGrit is ok after that massive shunt. Glad @Porsche Build strong cars.'

The 6 Hours of Sao Paulo ended behind the safety car. 

In a post on his website five days before the crash, Webber wrote about his high hopes for the race in Sao Paulo and called the Interlagos track 'a legendary circuit'.

'It has always been one of my most favourite tracks because of the history with the drivers they’ve had; Senna, Piquet and Fittipaldi did a huge amount for the sport. 

'The Brazilian’s love motorsport and are very passionate about it, it’s got a great atmosphere and there’s always been a bit of drama as well with unpredictable weather,' he said.

He added that the track reminds him of Brands Hatch and has a 'great vibe'.

Webber finished his F1 career with a race at Interlagos in 2013 and he has 'nice memories' off the track.

'Interlagos has always been good to me, I won there twice and been on the podium a few times so would it be great to finish my first season with Porsche in the WEC with another great result,' he said.

Organisers of the World Endurance Championship said Webber gave a thumbs up

However, Webber has crashed at the last corner of Interlagos before. During the 2003 Brazilian Grand Prix he had a wipe-out in the same spot.

The accident comes just days after the world of Australian sport was rocked by the tragic death of 25-year-old cricketer Phillip Hughes. 

Webber extended his condolences when he heard the news: 'That's really tough news about Phil Hughes. Thoughts with his family and loved ones at this moment. RIP champion.'
