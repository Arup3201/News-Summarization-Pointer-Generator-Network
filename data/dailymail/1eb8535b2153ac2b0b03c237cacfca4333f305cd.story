Italy defender Andrea Ranocchia was left confused by the presence of two adjacent toilets after arriving in Brazil for the World Cup.

The Inter Milan star took to Twitter to share an image of the toilets, which were presumably located inside the Azzurri's Rio training base.

Ranocchia, who is not part of Cesare Prandelli's 23-man squad but has still travelled to South America, posted the image along with the message: 'But why??? To never feel alone?'

This isn't the first time a sports star has had to endure side-by-side toilets in a single bathroom, with athletes at the Soci Winter Olympics earlier this year stumbling across the same setup.

Russian organisers were unable to confirm whether the double toilet was built on purpose or as a result of a plumbing error, but they certainly gave a number of competitors a laugh.

Ranocchia and his Italy team-mates will fly to Manaus later this week as they prepare to face England in their Group D opener.

Not the first time: The same thing happened at the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi earlier this year
