A mother-of-four who was stabbed-to-death alongside her children on Saturday night had repeatedly called family members to warn that her husband's jealous cousin was out of control but by the time anyone came to check on her, it was too late.

Growing increasingly concerned by Mingdong Chen's behavior, Qiao Zhen Li, 37, tried desperately to get hold of her husband, who wasn't home, but couldn't reach him.

She then called her mother-in-law in China who reached out to her daughter in the same Brooklyn, New York, neighborhood of Sunset Park, asking her and her husband to drop by the house.

'They bang on the door and they bang on the door,' Chief of Department Philip Banks III said. But they arrived too late.

In custody: Mingdong Chen, center, a suspect in the murder of a five people in Brooklyn's Sunset Park neighborhood, is walked by police from the 66th precinct, Sunday, October 27, 2013

Horror: The Chinese immigrant, who neighbors said struggled to survive in America, was arrested in the stabbing death Saturday night of his cousin's wife and her four children

When
 the door finally opened, there was Chen, 25, covered in blood. The couple called 911, and 
officers investigating another matter nearby responded quickly, Banks 
said, catching the suspect as he tried to flee.

Three of the victims—1-year-old William Zhuo, 7-year-old Amy Zhuo, 9-year-old Linda Zhuo—were dead at the scene, 
discovered in a back bedroom.

A bleeding and unconscious Li 
was rushed to the hospital along with her 5-year-old son Kevin after 
they were found in the kitchen. Neither survived.

'They were cut and butchered with a kitchen knife,' said Banks. 'It's a scene you'll never forget.'

The victims had wounds in their necks and torsos. The youngest child, the 1-year-old, was decapitated, according to reports.

Chen had been staying with the family for just over a week after arriving in New York from Chicago.

He had reportedly stayed with his cousin's family before without incident but this time Li felt he was acting suspiciously, according to neighbors and family members.

So much so that she had already tried to kick him out of the house, Li's cousin told Xiaowe Yang.

'She
 told him to go home,' Yang told the New York Daily News. 'The guy is 
very poor. He had no home. He had no place to live when he came to New 
York. She told him, "You just leave my house."'

Neighbors also said that days before the brutal killings, loud, late-night arguments could be heard from the street.

Chen remained 
'bizarrely calm' as he was dragged past his family's corpses and during 
his confession to police in which he said he was jealous of his victims'
 money.

'The family had too much. Their income (and) lifestyle was better than his,' a source told the New York Post.

The family did not appear to be better-off than those who lived around them in the working-class Chinese neighborhood near Ninth Avenue in Brooklyn. They sent their three school-age children to a local public school, according to the Education Department and Li stayed at home with William.

Witnesses said he was 'bizarrely calm,' even as body bags went past him as cops led him away

On Sunday, Mingdong Chen was charged with one count of first-degree murder, and two counts of 
murder in the second degree, as well as five counts of criminal 
possession of a weapon.

He reportedly showed 'no remorse' as he told police what he'd done and then tried to attack a police 
officer as he was being questioned at the 66th precinct.

The children's father learned the horrifying news though a police interpreter of Chinese. He had been out working at a restaurant job in Long Island when the killings occurred, according to neighbors who saw him in the street following the gruesome discovery.

'The father was freaking out,' May Chan, a neighbor, told the New York Daily News. 'He just came home from work and saw the police and they told him. He was hysterical.

'I
 always see (the kids) running around here,' he added. 
'They run around by my garage playing. They run up and down screaming. 
They're little kids ... that's so heartbreaking. Innocent kids, my God.'

Chen was unfazed, according to the New York Post, as body bags carrying the corpses of his alleged victims were wheeled by.

'He's
 lazy. He doesn't work too hard,' Gao Yun, 29, told the Post through 
sobs after learning of the rampage. 'The guy is crazy.'

Senseless: The victims are a 20-year-old woman, two girls aged nine and six, and two boys aged eight and eighteen-months-old

Gao also said Chen kept getting fired from various restaurant jobs after only a few weeks. She said she thought he had been fired again from a Sunset Park area restaurant on Saturday night.

'He was completely composed and 
answering their questions - even as they brought out two black bags with
 the kids in them,' a neighbor told the Post.

'He
 was still calmly answering their questions as the stretcher with the 
bloody child was rolled right past the car,' the neighbor added.

Chen was taken barefoot, his feet caked in blood, from the home in handcuffs by police.

Earlier reports said a sixth person is 
in critical condition at a local hospital, but spokespersons for both 
the NYPD and FDNY refuted that claim.

Chen was in custody and not 
immediately available to comment on Sunday; it was not clear whether he had a 
lawyer.

Bob
 Madden, who lives nearby, was out walking his dog Saturday night when 
he saw a man being escorted from the two-family brick house by police. 
He was barefoot, wearing jeans, and 'he was staring, he was 
expressionless,' Madden said.
