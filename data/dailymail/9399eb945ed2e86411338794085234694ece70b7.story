A rogue's gallery of some of Britain's most notorious petty thieves has revealed how they targeted railway stations to steal luggage, whisky and ladies' shoes from unsuspecting passengers.

The British Transport Police's History Group has published mug shots of those frequently caught stealing at stations across the country between the late 19th Century and early 20th Century.

The majority of offenders targeted distracted passengers - swiping their luggage from rest rooms, carriages and waiting rooms.

Caught in the act: North British Railway employee Thomas Drummond stole 12 bottles of whisky from a wagon and was jailed for 20 days

Tea time: John Moir, a goods checker at Leith Walk Goods Yard, stole some tea and was fined £3 or 10 days imprisonment in April 1920

Wanted: Margaret Leck was a travelling railway thief from Kendal, Westmorland, and was wanted for stealing a trunk from Edinburgh Waverley station in 1904

John Yates, alias John Hewitt, Patrick Hines, John Miller and John Roy, was sentenced to six months imprisonment with hard labour in March 1921 for theft of a parcel of clothing

Thief: Arthur Dunn was jailed for one month with hard labour in February 1920 for stealing dead rabbits from Wellington station

Mitchell Steadman-Turner was sentenced to six months in prison after stealing a Japanese basket from the waiting rooms at Waverley Station in Edinburgh in 1920.

While James Wilton - alias Charles Wharton - was sentenced to six months imprisonment with hard labour for stealing a bag at Paddington Station in 1887.

But some of the thieves were a bit more daring - and attempted to steal more unusual items.

North British Railway employee Thomas Drummond stole 12 bottles of whisky from a wagon and was sentenced for 20 days.

Over-exposed: Jack Graham-Parker was convicted of indecent exposure at Edinburgh station on three days in March 1920. He was sentenced to 60 days imprisonment

William Slater stole a Portmanteau from Edinburgh Waverley station and was sentenced to four months in jail in April 1917

Notorious: Leslie Hines was sentenced to six months imprisonment with hard labour for theft of a bag at King's Cross station in July 1904

Fine or the time: Private Roy Crooks, of the 2nd Battalion Australian Forces, stole a suitcase from Edinburgh Waverley station in January 1918 and was fined £7 or 30 days imprisonment

Adenan Zacarianoer was sentenced to 30 days in prison before being deported for stealing three pairs of ladies' shoes in 1922. While Patrick Woods was convicted of card sharping and sentenced to 60 days in prison in 1917.

Other punishments seem a little heavy handed by today's standards, with Edward Meitchie sentenced to three months in prison with hard labour for loitering at Derby Station in 1922.

Viv Head, a retired Detective Inspector with the British Transport Police, helped carry out the research to uncover the 'Rogue's Gallery'.

He said: 'One of the major problems with policing the railway network is that it always has been, by definition, a transient population. This applies as much to the victim as it does to the offender and especially to witnesses.

Margaret McConnell, while employed at Edinburgh Waverley station, stole parcels from an office and was fined £5 or 30 days imprisonment

Private Gordon Marr, of the 16th Battalion Canadian Scottish Regiment, was sentenced to 10 days imprisonment for theft of a box of fish from Edinburgh Waverley station on 22 January 1918

Scaling justice: John Calvert was jailed for six months for stealing a parcel containing a pair of brass weighing scales from Sheffield station in 1922

Servant Mitchell Steadman-Turner stole a Japanese basket from the waiting rooms at Waverley station in November 1920 and was sentenced to six months imprisonment

'With better communication and digital images, it is a great deal easier to track and arrest offenders these days. It is one reason why thefts of luggage are significantly less prevalent than they used to be.

'Before the digital age it was still important to circulate details of when and where offences were being committed and suspects.

'When offenders were arrested and went on to repeat their crimes it was quite common to circulate their photographs by way of bulletins and printed booklets.

'Copies were also kept at headquarters of course so that photograph "identity parades" could be held. They were a real rogues gallery and often looked exactly what they were - a rum bunch.'

Crowd who had 22 previous convictions, was jailed for three months hard labour for stealing a gents watch from the SS Hittery berthed at King George Dock, Hull
