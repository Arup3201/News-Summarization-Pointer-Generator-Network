Ever wondered what your offspring actually sees while being pushed around in their buggy? 

Well, one family visiting New York got to find out after they strapped a GoPro camera to their son's pram - producing an incredible tot's-eye view of the city.

Diego Acosta López, 32, spent more than five weeks studying in the city and captured everything his one-year-old son Ignacio saw from his seat when he arrived for a holiday.

Raining at Radio City...but little Ignacio, aged one, still got a great view of one of New York's most iconic entertainment venues. Above shows the snap captured by the GoPro camera attached to his buggy

The tot's pram provided an original vantage point on one of the world's most photographed cities... and Ignacio enjoyed his sightseeing tour with a Buzz Lightyear toy by his side

When the digital photography student, visiting from Quito in Ecuador, looked back at what the 'pramera' had caught, he found a stunning array of snapshots, perfectly capturing the Big Apple's iconic sights from a fresh perspective.

Among the slideshow of sights were shots of a damp-looking Times Square - pictured through the buggy's raincover; Central Park in all its tree-lined splendour and a shot of a commuter dozing off on the Subway. Little Ignacio even got a glimpse of New York's famous billboards, with a denim-clad female model clearly caught through the lens. 

Snap-happy Dad Diego received a grant from the Ecuadorian government to help him study for a master's degree in digital photography at the School of Visual Arts in New York - moving away from his native Ecuador to study. He started the series when his family came to visit him in New York for the first time.

Diego said: 'I first visited New York in 2007 and felt a strong connection to the city. I loved the visual richness of Manhattan... along with all of the cultural places.

'During one class my teacher, James Estrin, suggested I put the camera inside the chair so I just set up it and I gave it a lot of rides.

'I found that the GoPro is a wonderful tool to document everything you want - it is easy to handle and it adapts to everywhere.

He added that the project wasn't technically difficult but finding the perfect position for the camera was trickier.

'The time was challenging - trying to choose the best images in the most iconic places and at the same time dealing with classes and the rest of other final projects was tough.

'It's hard to choose my favourite, but I feel that the image where Ignacio is looking at an empty box of chocolates and the background is this beautiful view of a forest with reflections over the lake is incredible.

'It gives life from a child's perspective - he only cares about the chocolate and not the view or even the park - he just want more chocolate.

Central Park's beautiful foliage is enticing but Ignacio seems more interested in the chocolate wrapper that he's holding. Dad Paulo said: 'He only cares about the chocolate and not the view or even the park.'

Diego said: 'The pushchair series was my final project for the editorial art class. Last semester, I was trying to tell the relationship between my son, Ignacio, and his first experience of visiting New York.

'At the beginning of this project my images were from outside the pushchair but I felt that the story was not strong enough.

'Most of the viewers have liked the images for their unique and original point of view.

'They give a truly unique perspective and I think that the images get people inside the pushchair too.

'I also believe that parents mainly love the images because now they know how their children perceive the world.'
