The chiselled features of Rupert Penry-Jones don’t just turn heads, they set hearts a-flutter and reduce hitherto dynamic, accomplished women to simpering schoolgirls.

The towering star of Whitechapel and Silk is lusted after by everyone from the woman next door to the highest paid female TV presenter in the country.

According to Maxine Peake, his co-star in legal drama Silk, she can slip into the public gallery at the Old Bailey to research her role unrecognised, but when Rupert once accompanied her, 'Women were cooing and going all gooey over him.'

Toff totty: Rupert Penry-Jones will appear in the new series of ITV's Whitechapel which begins this week

And who can forget that embarrassing interview last year on This Morning, when Holly Willoughby, who’s interviewed Hollywood stars, prime ministers and Olympic heroes, stammered, giggled and blushed before finally burying her face in a cushion to mask her discomfort?

No, there’s no denying Rupert’s a heart-throb. As his actress wife and former M&S voiceover doyenne Dervla Kirwan might have purred, 'Not just any heart-throb, but Britain’s heart-throb.'

Because, while most of his other pretty boy contemporaries have moved to Hollywood, the most handsome home-grown talent on British TV is thankfully still here, gracing our screens for up to six months of the year. 

We meet on the appropriately creepy set of the fourth series of his horror detective show Whitechapel.

The disused Hornsey Town Hall in north London is a former Art Deco masterpiece now full of mysterious dark corridors, strange noises and rumours of ghosts. Rupert, 42, has been doing 12-hour shifts all week, but he strides into the room with a big smile.

He’s as charismatic and charming as he is handsome, and he’s obviously used to calming down excitable women. 'When an attractive woman finds you attractive and says nice things about you it’s fine,' he says recalling the Willoughby incident. 'Holly’s lovely so I’m not complaining. I didn’t mind at all!'

And what does his poor wife make of all the fuss? She is, after all, no shrinking violet, as Rupert revealed recently when he told an interviewer she had a stand-up row with his mother in London’s Wolseley restaurant which became so heated neither woman ate and they left in separate taxis.

'Dervla started so many fundamental 
changes in my life, and there’s been no resistance from me. She’s just 
the right woman for me, she "gets" me. I can be myself with her'

Dervla has since said the two women have made up and now have 'a very good relationship'. 'She isn’t threatened, she’s very secure,' Rupert says of the mother of his two children, Florence, nine, and Peter, six.

He and the former Ballykissangel star have been together for 12 years, after working on the JB Priestley play Dangerous Corner, and despite all the attention Rupert gets, they appear to have one of the most stable relationships in showbiz.

Before he met Dervla, Rupert was something of a playboy – he once dated Kylie Minogue – but he says his marriage calmed him down and the pair recently swapped London for rural Hampshire.

Most weekends, he says, they’ll be cuddled up on the sofa with their two children and border collie, Blue, watching a film.

'Dervla started so many fundamental changes in my life, and there’s been no resistance from me. She’s just the right woman for me, she "gets" me. I can be myself with her.'

Rupert was born of acting stock; his mother is To The Manor Born’s Angela Thorne and his father Howards’ Way’s Peter Penry-Jones. As a dyslexic who left school without any qualifications, acting seemed a natural fit.

Rupert was thrown out of the Bristol Old Vic drama school for ‘being a bad influence’ (he argued with his teachers) but still managed to get into the RSC and had a succession of small to middling parts on TV before finding fame in Spooks as Section D’s loose cannon Adam Carter.

After leaving the show rather explosively in 2008 there was a brief hiatus when he tried his luck in America. He was picked up to star in a detective drama called The Forgotten and filmed the pilot; but when it was finally commissioned he was replaced by Christian Slater in the lead role. The show still flopped.

Making it in Hollywood still remains an ambition, but Rupert’s come to terms with the fact it might never happen.

'Of course, the grass is always greener; you always want to do something else,' he says. 'But I’d be crazy to jack in everything I have here and go. The only way I’d be available to go and work there would be to say goodbye to shows I really like and then, potentially, have nothing. And I can’t do that; I have a family I’m responsible for.'

If Spielberg were to call, he adds, he might contemplate a move. Until then he’s enjoying what he has here. Whitechapel was originally envisaged as a one-off series; an intriguing story about a modern day copycat of the Jack The Ripper killings. Rupert plays the super-uptight Detective Inspector Joseph Chandler, who was brought in to solve the case. To everyone’s surprise it was a huge hit and 2009’s highest performing new drama. 

When we meet, Rupert is filming the fourth series of the ITV show which, he believes, has taken on a life of its own. 'It’s a funny show; it seems to be turning into something we never envisaged. At first you think, "How many copycat killings can there be?" But now it’s reinvented itself.

'It’s quite a different beast to the original but we think this will be our best series yet. It’s rare to work on a show that gets better as it goes along but long may that continue.

Scary: Even Rupert has felt a shiver run down his spine after watching his crime drama, Whitechapel

'The writers have brought in elements that relate to the first and second series while it will also focus more on what’s happening in the police station. The show we’re filming today is about witches and in the story all the characters are spooked by it.

'There’s a sense of evil in the station itself. There’s not very much that is real about the show and my character is not the most convincing detective on TV but we enjoy the fact that there’s something a bit ridiculous about it.

'I think what people love about the show is its scary elements. I even get scared watching it. There was an episode last year which had a guy hiding in people’s walls. After I watched it at home – and I couldn’t believe I was doing this – but I made sure every door was locked. I think being scared gives you a thrill; it makes you feel alive.'

Rupert also enjoys getting into the idiosyncrasies of his character, who’s a bundle of repression and suffers from OCD. 'It’s fun to have something like that to play with as an actor,' he says.

'I use it to express emotion. I’m constantly trying to find new things for him to do but they can’t be for the sake of it; I wouldn’t want to be disrespectful to people who do have OCD. It can be a horribly debilitating illness.

'I’d say I have it a bit; Dervla definitely would say I have it. I enjoy cleaning and tidying. I’m not quite as bad as David Beckham but I think anyone would have OCD if they lived with my wife.

'Everything has a place in my house and if it’s not put back in the right place, I’m not happy. But I think that’s just sensible. She’s more chaotic. If she had her way, there would be deodorant next to jam – everything in the same cupboard!'

'Of course, the grass is always greener;
you always want to do something else,' he says. 'But I’d be crazy to 
jack in everything I have here and go to America'

While Whitechapel airs, Rupert will be filming Silk, his big show for rival channel BBC1, in which he and Maxine Peake play two competing but friendly barristers.

Both shows also, coincidentally, star veteran actor Phil Davis. who Rupert’s known for over a decade since appearing in North Square – another legal drama by Silk’s writer Peter Moffat. In Whitechapel Phil plays Chandler’s disgruntled No. 2 Ray Miles while in Silk he’s dodgy solicitor Mickey Joy. 

Unsurprisingly the two have become good friends, bonding over a love of red wine, snooker and Scrabble.

'We have a similar sense of humour and we agree about a lot of things to do with work,' says Rupert.

'We text and ring each other quite a lot; I don’t think we’ve ever had a cross word. It’s one of the great things about becoming an actor that you get to become friends with people from different walks of life.'

He’s still ambitious, but for now Rupert seems content to be a leading man on our two biggest TV channels.

'Things are going pretty well and I’m really enjoying this journey,' he says. And then, with a quick smile – but no kiss – the handsome, charming and, as I now know, housework-loving Rupert Penry-Jones leaves the room. Sigh.

Whitechapel returns on Wednesday at 9pm on ITV.
