Arsene Wenger has left goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny sweating on his place in the team for Sunday's clash with Stoke following his smoking shame.

Szczesny, who has apologised to Wenger, has been fined after being caught smoking in the dressing room following the defeat to Southampton on New Year's Day.

And Wenger has not guaranteed the Pole his place in the team for Sunday's clash.

Wenger revealed he grew up in a time of military service and was paid in cigarettes

 

'I've not selected the first XI yet,' said Wenger.

'I take everything into account when I pick my team. I don't want to talk about that, it doesn't need to be public.'

He added: 'We have three goalkeepers at Arsenal who are top class.' 

Wenger, who used to smoke while in the dugout during his days in charge of Monaco, has insisted that he is now firmly opposed to the habit.

'I am against smoking. I grew up in a period where I did military service and got paid in cigarettes. It excited us to smoke.'

Mesut Ozil has been back in training for Arsenal ahead of their home game against Stoke City

Wenger has denied that he didn't wish Lukas Podolski farewell following the German's switch to Inter Milan

Wenger has also denied accusations from Lukas Podolski that he didn't wish the German farewell when he left for Inter Milan this week.

'I deny that completely, I had many conversations with him about going on loan. He needed my permission and I gave him my position.'

Aaron Ramsey, Mesut Ozil and Mathieu Flamini have all been training ahead of the visit of Stoke, but Danny Welbeck is still unavailable. The Gunners will, however, be boosted by the return from suspension of Olivier Giroud.
