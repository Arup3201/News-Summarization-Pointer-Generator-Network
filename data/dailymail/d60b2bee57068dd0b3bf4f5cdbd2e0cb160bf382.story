A female climber who almost lost her legs in a horrific fall has made a miraculous recovery to be able to climb once more.

Rannveig Aamodt, 30, fell while scaling a cliff in Geyikbayiri, Turkey, on April 26 2012.

Her broken body lay twisted on the ground, bleeding from a gash on her head, while her husband - who had been taking the slack of the line for his wife while she climbed - could only look on and try to 
keep her stable.

But less than a year later, the climber was scaling cliff faces once more - and tackling her hardest challenge to date.

Rannveig Aamodt, 30, fell while scaling a cliff and suffered injuries so bad she thought she would never walk again

Her husband, Nathan Welton, 36, said the last thing he 
remembers seeing was his wife falling, her arms flailing in the hope of 
grasping anything - but she was not so lucky.

Ms Aamodt suffered dislocations and 
fractures of both ankles, three vertebral compression fractures, a 
pelvis fracture, various fractures of the small bones in her feet, an 
open fracture to her right elbow and tears and ruptures of tendons in 
her ankles and upper arm.

Ms Aamodt, who splits her time between Estes Park in Colorado, USA and Molde, Norway, underwent a series of operations which left her body mummified and wrapped in plaster.

It was then that she and her husband decided to document her road to recovery - Mr Welton agreed to take pictures every step of the way with the couple having little knowledge of just how well her wounds would heal.

Over the first few weeks she was unsure whether she was going to lose her legs, whether she would be able to walk again, let alone climb again.

Mr Welton documented the entire process - from his wife lying in a hospital bed, to a wheelchair, to eventually being able to put weight on the lower half of her body once again.

By May 8, 2012 Ms Aamodt had returned to Norway where she was cared for at the St Olavs University Hospital, Trondheim.

She was still in a wheelchair until late June. Within six weeks she was moved to Cato Rehab Center, near Oslo.

After a total of 18 weeks in Norway the couple travelled to Colorado and in October decided to take a vacation to celebrate her ever-improving health. It was while on this trip that Ms Aamodt had a suggestion- she asked to go climbing.

Mr Welton, camera in hand, continued to shoot shots of his wife's incredible return to the sport, which he said was less enjoyable after her accident.

Following the climb, Ms Aamodt said she felt invigorated - returning to Oslo for more rehab, before spending several months in the warm climate of Thailand to help the arthritis in her ankles.

Throughout 2013, though still bearing the ankle and elbow scars, she returned to some of the best shape of her life, and has since gone on to complete some of the toughest climbs she has come across.

The couple hope that his photo essay will inspire others as well as tell the remarkable tale of Ms Aamodt's road to recovery.

Mr Welton said: 'Rannveig encouraged me to pick up my camera and document the whole process, and a number of photographer colleagues encouraged me as well.

'I think it's helpful for both of us to have visual reminders of how far she's come and what bad shape she was in.

'It's astonishing that she can walk, much less climb, and the photos serve to remind me how strong she is.

'The first time we climbed together after the accident was a pretty emotional experience, but it felt great to to be back doing what we love to do together. We have both gone on to climb the hardest routes of our lives.'

Ms Aamodt added: 'I felt like there was no other way than to try to accept my situation and make the best out of it.

'The most important thing for me was to have a plan of attack, and to trust that what I was doing was the right thing. My biggest nightmare was imagining myself in the future, wondering if I would be less disabled if I did anything different or worked harder.

'I decided I was going to win back what I lost, and more, so I made small goal myself every day. I had lost the range of motion in my right arm, so my first goal was to be able to feed myself, than touch my nose, then brush my hair and so on.

'The rest of the rehab process was like this: set goal, find a strategy and put down the work that it required.

'Climbing is my passion. It almost killed me but it also helped me get back to where I am today.'
