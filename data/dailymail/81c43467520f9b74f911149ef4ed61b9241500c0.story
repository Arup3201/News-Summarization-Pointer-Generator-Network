EasyJet has apologised and dropped an advertising campaign after being accused of making ‘cheap jibes’ about a seaside town.

The budget airline faced criticism after running poster ads on the rail network with the slogan: ‘This year, end up in Malaga, not Margate.’

Locals in the Kent resort took offence at the airline publicly poking fun at their town with some taking to Twitter to rally to the town’s defence.

Local resident and councillor, Will Scobie, said EasyJet had picked the wrong target for its advertising campaign.
