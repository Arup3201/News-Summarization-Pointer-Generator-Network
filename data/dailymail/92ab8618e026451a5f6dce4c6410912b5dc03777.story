The sight of millions of stars would be enough to humble most people - never mind experienced photographer Craig Richards, who made a six-hour round trip to capture this incredible panorama of the Milky Way on a bitterly cold night.

Dressed in a thick jacket and boots, the 42-year-old drove from his home in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, to Holy Island off the Northumberland Coast just after 1am on a mission to capture something very special.

There he set up his Nikon D800e, complete with a wide-angle lens, and took eight carefully-planned shots which he digitally stitched together after he returned home at 7am - to a full day's work in his other job as a web designer.

The perfect shot: Photographer Craig Richards spent hours capturing this image from Holy Island off the Northumberland coast on a chilly winter's night. The conditions had to be just right - with clear skies, low tides, no moon and winter conditions - before he could take his eight images which he painstakingly stitched together

As the Milky Way emits so little 
light compared to factors like streetlights, the moon and the glow of 
sunset, the freelance photographer had to plan his photo carefully.

'An image such as this requires lots of variables to be 
in place including the right time of year for the Milky Way to be seen 
off the east coast,' he said.

'It was a bitterly cold night,' said Mr Richards (pictured). 'I needed a big winter jacket, winter trousers, big boots, gloves, hat and of course my flask of coffee!'

'This tends to be during February through to mid May - any later with the
 early rising sun, you get to much 'sun' pollution in the night sky at 
around the time you'd expect to see the Milky Way.

'No moon, as the moon 
sheds too much light into the night sky and of course clear skies.'

On the night of his visit in March, he figured out the moon would be setting at 3.30am - just in time for the Milky Way to rise.

Then there was the tide - with its famous Lindisfarne Castle which can be seen in the background, Holy Island is detached from the mainland and could only be reached via a narrow causeway when the water was low, at 2am.

And lastly, there was his one-year-old grandson, who Mr Richards put to bed and left with the rest of his family before creeping quietly out of the house.

'It was a bitterly cold night,' said Mr Richards. 'I needed a big winter jacket, winter trousers, big boots, gloves, hat and of course my flask of coffee!'

He set up his camera on a tripod and using a head torch, he cast light on the upturned fisherman's boats in the foreground for his 28-second exposures - something which drew some unwanted attention from the police.

An officer crossed over to the island and questioned him.

'I guess a strange man stood out by the boat sheds with a head torch is a bit suspicious!' he said. 'He was suitably impressed when I showed him a couple of the images from the back of my camera.'

He added: 'At 5.30am after packing up, I headed back home - stopping off at McDonald's for a well deserved breakfast and cappuccino, eventually arriving back home at around 7:30am - ready to start a regular day's work!

'I didn't even look at the images on the Mac until around lunchtime, at which point I was bouncing with joy over what I'd captured.'

Streetlights could not be avoided entirely - the yellow light to the left of the award-winning shot is from the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, while the right hand side shows Bamburgh.

But Mr Richards said: 'I’m utterly over the moon with the final images and people’s reactions have been extremely complimentary.

'It’s
 been my best-selling piece of work to date. The image really comes to 
life when you see it as a large, high-quality print.'
