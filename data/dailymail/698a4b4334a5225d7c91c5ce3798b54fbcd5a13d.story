These intricate creations look like a church's stained glass windows - but are actually layers and layers of carefully cut paper.

The laser-cut sculptures are the work of artist Eric Standley, 45, who stumbled across the idea by accident.

'I was working on another project that included laser cutting circle-based patterns into Cheerios boxes,' said Standley, an associate professor of art at Virginia Tech.

It's not a stained glass window, but hundreds of pieces of paper cut and layered by artist Eric Standley

The sculptures bind layers of paper together once an intricate cutting process has taken place

This piece, called Demeter, is Standley's largest work so far at 134 layers deep

Demeter took three months to complete, with each laser-cut sheet of paper stacked by hand

'When I was leaving the laser lab one day I stacked a few cut pieces together and was blown away by the layered complexity of the different works.

'I took out my sketchbook straight away and wrote down a dozen questions that took about two years to work through, to enable me to come up with the finished idea.'

Each piece takes about 80 hours of laser-cutting time, using 100 layers of coloured paper on average.

The sheets of cut paper are assembled by hand then bound to reveal the finished work.

One piece of artwork takes Standley up to four months to complete.

His largest work so far is called Demeter and made of 134 layers of paper.

The works are finished by being bound into a flipbook. The orange cover frames the details in the centre of the books

Professor Standley's foray into working with paper was accidental, he says

Each designs takes between three to four months of work to become a finished piece

'I'm like a monk with a laser,' Standley told Wired magazine.

'I give it everything - it's not just pushing a button. You've got to have faith in what you do - you can't fake faith.'

The projects are meticulously planned before the laser comes out.

He said: 'I sketch a composition first, working out an overall goal.

'Then I draw each layer in vector-based software. Each layer is cut individually with a CNC Laser.

Standley's projects are inspired by Gothic, Islamic, and Greek art motifs

This one looks like a window to the sea made of delicate loops of paper

Standley began working with lasers on his own paintings before trying the technique on card and then paper

Up to 80 hours is spent on the cutting of the paper alone

'The work is then cleaned of chads [leftover bits of paper], assembled and bound like a flip book.

'The
final stage of my process includes building a mount and frame that 
holds the work, allowing for a degree of movement that is inherent with 
paper.'

Professor Standley took inspiration by 
Gothic, Islamic, and Greek art motifs, first copying their geometry before 'riffing' his own ideas.

Different angles reveal more detail in each piece thanks to the way they are stacked

The plan for each design is sketched out by hand then drawn in vector-based software

The 3D pieces are often symmetrical to mimic ancient art motifs

The creations mimic the symmetry of his influences and reveal colours and shapes when explored from different angles.

He said: 'I've been fortunate in the 
work's reception. Someone described my work as "otherworldly". That rang
positively with me.

'Truly
this work could not be done without the use of technology, although 
whatever the reason, I'm lucky enough to have the patience to do what I 
do.'
