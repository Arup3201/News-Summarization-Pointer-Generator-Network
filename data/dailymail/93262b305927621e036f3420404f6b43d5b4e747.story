The good old days: A model poses with an older version of the electric kettle at the Ideal Home Exhibition

Fancy a cuppa? You might well be advised to put in some earplugs first.

Some electric kettles make so much noise when boiling water that they are as loud as power tools, a study has found.

Independent tests on electric models available on the High Street found others louder than a vacuum cleaner and another on par with a  lawnmower.

One kettle – the Nuo Findon – put through its paces by consumer watchdogs Which? hit 95 decibels –  the same level as a drill.

Many customers find the noise a problem, saying they could not hear the radio or other people talking above the din.

Which? found the noise of kettles tested ranged from 79 to 95 decibels (dB), which compared to 90dB for a lawnmower and 83dB for a vacuum cleaner. A normal conversation is around 60dB, meaning a loud kettle can drown out the radio.

Which? said: ‘Unbelievably, some kettles are as loud as an electric drill. No wonder noisy boiling is one of the biggest bugbears.

‘Fortunately, there are much  quieter kettles out there. A noisy kettle can be a real irritation while you’re waiting to brew a cuppa, which is why our reviews include noise ratings.

‘We measure noise levels while a kettle boils and ask a listening panel to rate how intrusive the noise is.

‘Some, such as an Nuo Findon GCRO44, can be as loud as 95dB when boiling, while a drill reaches a similar level.’

Which? said the quietest models included the Phillips HD4671, Bosch TWK86104GB and Breville VKJ366. Its laboratory tests examined the decibel levels, boiling time and overall performance of each device.

Earsplitting noise: how the loudest and the quietest kettles compare in decibels and prices

A Which? member who bought a Kenwood model said: ‘This kettle is deafeningly noisy almost from the moment it is switched on, meaning, for instance, that you cannot listen to the radio while it is running.’ 

This month, a report found that three-quarters of households waste a total of £68million a year in power and water by overfilling their kettles and boiling too much liquid.

The Energy Saving Trust found  95 per cent of people use the kettle every day and 40 per cent boil water five times a day or more. 

Homes use nine billion litres of water every day, with showers using a quarter of the total and toilets using up 22 per cent.

The familiar gentle sound of a humming refrigerator is roughly 40 decibels.

Normal office conversation levels equates to around 50 decibels.

An electric shaver or loud alarm clock can reach 80 decibels.

The roar of a lawn mower is approximately 90 decibels.

The deafening sound of a chainsaw is around 110 decibels.
