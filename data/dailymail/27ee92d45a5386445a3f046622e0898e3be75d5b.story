Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas says he has asked the United Nations to admit the state of Palestine as a full member.

The move defies U.S.-led international pressure on Mr Abbas to abandon such a bid.

In response, Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu said: 'I extend my hand to the Palestinian people,' adding that he wanted a 'just and lasting peace' with Palestine

However, Mr Netanyahu has opposed the bid for statehood at the UN general assembly in New York.

Mr Abbas is sidestepping nearly two decades of troubled negotiations in the hope this dramatic move on the world stage will re-energise Palestine's quest for an independent homeland.

He was greeted by sustained applause and appreciative whistles as he started to deliver a speech outlining his country's aspiration of becoming a full member of the United Nations.

However, some members of the Israeli delegation, including Foreign Minister Avigdor Liebermann, left the hall as Abbas approached the podium.

Negotiations with Israel 'will be meaningless' as long as it continues building on lands the Palestinians claim for their state, Mr Abbas declared, warning that his government could collapse if the construction persists.

'This policy is responsible for the continued failure of the successive international attempts to salvage the peace process,' said the president, who has refused to negotiate until the construction stops.

'This settlement policy threatens to also undermine the structure of the Palestinian National Authority and even end its existence.'

To another round of applause, he held up a copy of the formal membership application and said he had asked UN chief Ban Ki-moon to speed up consideration of his request to have the United Nations recognise a Palestinian state in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem.

He concluded his speech by saying, 'We have one goal: to be. And we shall be.'

Mr Abbas' jubilant mood was matched by the exuberant celebration of thousands of Palestinians who thronged around outdoor screens in town squares across the West Bank on Friday to see their president submit his historic request for recognition of a state of Palestine.

'I am with the president,' said Muayad Taha, a 36-year-old physician, who brought his two children, ages 7 and 10, to witness the moment. 'After the failure of all other methods we reached a stage of desperation.

'This is a good attempt to put the Palestinian cause and the Palestinian people on the map. Everyone is here to stand behind the leadership.'

Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, addressing the General Assembly shortly after Abbas, said his country was 'willing to make painful compromises.'

'I extend my hand to the Palestinian people, with whom we seek a just and lasting peace,' he said, to extended applause.

Palestinians, he added, 'should live in a free state of their own, but they should be ready for compromise' and 'start taking Israel's security concerns seriously.'

Mr Netanyahu offered to meet Mr Abbas in the Palestinian city of Ramallah, but added that he would be willing to meet for talks in New York tonight.

He said: 'Who's there to stop us? What is there to stop us? I'll tell you my needs and concerns, you'll tell me yours. And with God's help we'll find the common ground of peace.'

Even if the UN recognises Palestine, 
there will be few immediate changes on the ground: Israel will continue
to occupy the West Bank and east Jerusalem and to restrict access to 
Gaza, ruled by Hamas militants.

Security Council action on the membership request could take weeks or months.

The strategy has put the 
Palestinians in direct confrontation with the U.S., which has threatened
to veto their membership bid in the Council, saying that statehood can 
only be achieved through direct negotiations between the parties to end 
the long and bloody conflict.

'Deeply confrontational': Tony Blair has today cautioned against Palestinian statehood

By seeking approval at a world forum 
overwhelmingly sympathetic to their quest, Palestinians hope to make it 
harder for Israel to resist global pressure to negotiate the borders of a
future Palestine based on lines Israel held before capturing the West 
Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza in 1967.

The U.S. and Israel have been 
pressuring Council members to either vote against the plan or abstain 
when it comes up for a vote. The vote would require the support of nine 
of the Council's 15 members to pass, but even if the Palestinians could secure that backing, the U.S. says it will veto the move.

The resumption of talks seems an 
elusive goal, with both sides digging in to positions that have tripped 
up negotiations for years.

Israel has warned that the Palestinian appeal to the UN will have a disastrous effect on negotiations.

Talks broke down nearly three years ago after Israel went to war in the 
Gaza Strip. A last round was launched a year ago, but broke down just 
three weeks later.

The UN recognition bid has won Mr 
Abbas broad popular support at home, but it is opposed by his main 
political rival, the Islamic militant Hamas movement that wrested 
control of Gaza in 2007.

Gaza's Hamas prime minister, Ismail 
Haniyeh, said: 'The Palestinian people do not beg the world for a state,
and the state can't be created through decisions and initiatives.

'States liberate their land first and then the political body can be established.'

The
plea came as former Prime Minister Tony Blair warned that the move will
be 'deeply confrontational' without a return to peace talks with the 
Israelis.

The former 
prime minister, now Middle East representative for the international 
community, told BBC Radio 4's World at One that UN recognition would not
change conditions on the ground in the Occupied Territories.

He
stressed that he was not trying to block the application for Palestine 
to be recognised as a state and said its leaders were 'entirely entitled
to do so'.

But he went on:
'You can pass whatever resolution you like at the United Nations or the
Security Council, it doesn't actually deliver you a state on the ground
in the West Bank and Gaza, and if you don't have a negotiation, 
whatever you do at the UN is going to be deeply confrontational.'

The
issue has divided the international community, with Israel and the U.S. 
strongly opposed and France trying to seek a compromise.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has admitted to 'debates' at the top of government about how Britain should respond.

Mr Blair, special envoy for the U.S., 
UN, EU and Russia Quartet, said he was working day and night to find a 
way of relaunching negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.

He suggested Mr Abbas 
did not need the statehood recognition to hold talks with Israel.

'When you actually get down to the 
detail of territory, security, Jerusalem, refugees, water, all the 
issues, to be absolutely frank about it, it doesn't make a great deal of
difference whether you are designating someone as a state or not a 
state,' he said.

'The Palestinian Authority and President Abbas are perfectly able to negotiate with the Israelis.'

He added: 'With the changes going on 
in the region at the moment, there is a huge strategic interest on both 
sides to get a credible negotiation going again.'

U.S. President Barack Obama has also 
pleaded with Mr Abbas to drop the application in case it causes further 
violence in the region.
