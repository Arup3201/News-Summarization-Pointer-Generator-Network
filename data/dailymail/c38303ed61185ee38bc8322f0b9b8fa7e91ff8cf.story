The plants are mostly associated with isolated desert areas of the United States, largely thanks to their regular appearances in Westerns.

But North America's most common 
tumbleweed, the Russian thistle, is not native to the continent - it seems to have been imported into America from Russia in the 19th century in shipments of flaxseed.

Tumbleweed is the name given to a number of plants which detach from their roots at maturity, and are carried by the wind.

Roots: A crew removes tumbleweeds the size of compact cars from a slope in East Los Angeles. Tumbleweed is mostly associated with isolated desert areas of the United States, largely thanks to their regular appearances in Westerns

Easy game: Tumbleweeds have trouble taking root in cultivated lawns. An abandoned house near Lancaster is easy game

National Geographic reports tumbleweed is an invader from the Eurasian steppes east of the Ural Mountains.

Kali tragus or the Russian thistle grows best in dry and barren land - it has trouble taking root in areas such as cultivated lawns.

Every winter the plants die, and the stems become brittle, breaking with a gust of wind.

Deserted: A couple of tumbleweeds make their way across the top of a sand dune near Sand Springs in Monument Valley. Round and lightweight, a single tumbleweed can roll for miles, scattering thousands of seeds along the way

Festive weed: Each Christmas season a tumbleweed snowman, built by New MexicoÂ¿s Albuquerque Metropolitan Arroyo Flood Control Authority, rises along Interstate 40. At 13 feet, the 2012 snowman was the biggest yet

Building up: Skeletons of Russian thistle, better known as tumbleweed, pile up in a yard in Lancaster, California

National Geographic ran a feature on tumbleweed this month

Round and 
lightweight, a single tumbleweed can roll for miles, scattering 
thousands of seeds along the way.

The
plants curl into a ball when dry and uncurl when moist are a common
sight in steppe and desert areas, such as large parts of Texas and 
Arizona.

Getting as large as cars, they can bury a house or feed the fury of range fires.

Tumbleweed
seeds, foliage and stems are eaten by a number of desert dwellers, 
including quail, ground squirrels, pocket mice, prairie dogs, kangaroo 
rats and mule deer.

Tumbleweed was first noticed in America in October 1880 when the Department of Agriculture in Washington received information that a strange plant that had begun appearing in the farmlands of South Dakota.

Some stories claim that it was brought to America by Ukrainian farmers, but it's exactly origins are tricky to pinpoint.

In the 1890s a legislator proposed that a fence be built around the state to stem the incursion, but a decade after it had first been noticed, it was too late and the weed had already found its way to Canada.

It quickly spread across the West and by 1885 it had reached California and in 1959 it was collected for the first time in Hawaii.

Today the USDA Plants Database lists Russian thistle growing in every state except Florida and Alaska.

The tumbleweed appeared in Western films which typically have barren and sparse landscapes - it has now come to represent dry and abandoned landscapes as it used to represent a bad joke or awkward silence.

Tumbleweeds aren't considered as having any redeeming value, althoough a study did reveal that tumbling tumbleweeds soak up depleted uranium from contaminated soils at weapons testing grounds.
