A woman in the Perth suburb of Thornlie received the shock of her life while watching television with her daughter on Tuesday night.

A Hyundai sedan travelled through the back fence of a neighbour's place before knocking down a semi-enclosure and landing in Pat McCarthy's kitchen around 7.15pm.

The 72-year-old had just made a cup of tea, and was settled in the living room moments before a driver ploughed into the back of her property.

'I could have been pinned up against that fridge with the kitchen,' Mrs McCarthy told Channel Nine News in Perth.

Mrs McCarthy's daughter Lauren was also at home, and would have been asleep in the room the car destroyed had the accident occurred a few hours later.

Determined to stay: The 72-year-old great-grandmother recently renovated her house and is now concerned about the potential $100,000 cost of damages

Only just having finished renovations at her Majestic Court home, Mrs McCarthy is determined to stay in her house.

'I heard a little bang and then an almighty bang, like a bomb had gone off,' she told The West Australian.

'It's disgraceful, someone has to pay for it,' Mrs McCarthy also said. 'I shouldn't be liable, my insurance shouldn't be liable.'

According to the publication, on Wednesday morning SES personnel put temporary support beams in place to hold up the damaged structure.

A spokesperson for the Department of Fire and Emergency Services told Perth Now that the damages could cost close to $100,000, which according to the figure suggested at least a third of the building was affected.

The 63-year-old driver of the car was from the nearby suburb of Huntingdale, and gave a blood alcohol reading above the legal limit of 0.05.

According to Channel Nine News, this is the eighth time a car has collided with a house in Perth this month.
