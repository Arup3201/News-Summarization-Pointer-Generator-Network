Kevin Nolan could miss six weeks with a fractured shoulder, West Ham boss Sam Allardyce has confirmed.

Nolan damaged his shoulder in training on Thursday, missing the Hammers' 3-1 Premier League victory at Crystal Palace on Saturday.

Manager Allardyce admitted the Hammers will miss captain Nolan's influence, but backed 'the best and strongest squad I've put together at the club' to handle his absence.

Strength in depth: But Sam Allardyce has backed 'best and strongest squad' to cope in his absence

'Kevin fractured his shoulder and that's a massive blow to us, along with all the other players we've got injured,' said Allardyce.

'He will be out for probably six weeks I would think.

'It isn't a dislocated shoulder, it's a fractured shoulder, but I don't know just how long that will keep Kevin out.

'We dealt with it brilliantly at Palace and let's hope we can continue to do that.

'It didn't affect us at Palace and maybe that's a sign there's more to come.'

Poacher: And Carlton Cole grabbed a third after Stewart Downing scored to round off a 3-1 win

Mauro Zarate's volleyed debut goal set West Ham en route to victory at Selhurst Park, with Stewart Downing and Carlton Cole also on target.

West Ham were missing Matt Jarvis, Andy Carroll, Carl Jenkinson and James Collins at Palace, as well as Nolan.

Allardyce believes the comfortable victory indicates his squad's strength in depth.

'We were missing five players who play a big part in our squad, so to win the game comfortably with as many injuries as that was extremely pleasing.

'So perhaps this might be the best and strongest squad I've put together at the club - I hope it is.'
