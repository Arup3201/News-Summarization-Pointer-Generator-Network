Spice Girl Melanie Chisholm  revealed she has banned her five-year-old daughter Scarlet from looking at pictures of Rihanna

She exposed more than her fair share of flesh during her days as a Spice Girl often favouring a crop top to flaunt her toned torso.

But Melanie Chisholm yesterday revealed she has banned her five-year-old daughter Scarlet from looking at pictures of Rihanna because she thinks the pop star is too raunchy.

Explaining her decision, the 40-year-old also urged female stars to show a little 'more dignity' and stop being so overtly sexual.

Miss Chisholm, who was once better known as Sporty Spice, said: 'My five-year-old daughter loves Rihanna. 

'But she has no idea what her idol looks like, because there is little footage of Rihanna that I'm happy for her to see. 

'It's a shame that a talented, successful woman expresses herself in such an overtly sexual way. Not that we can boil the problem down to one female singer baring her flesh. 

'We need to have a bigger conversation about society's obsession with celebrity. It's vulgar and narcissistic and I worry about how it affects young girls.'

It is not the first time Rihanna, 26, has come under fire for her provocative and sexually suggestive image and her risqué outfits.

Two years ago she was dropped by Nivea as her image was considered inappropriate for a family brand.

Miss Chisholm along with former bandmates Victoria Beckham, Mel B, Emma Bunton and Geri Halliwell championed 'Girl Power' as a term of empowerment in the 1990s and turned themselves into multi-millionaires in the process.

She said the problem did not 'boil down' to one female singer exposing her flesh.

Unlike some of today's acts, the Spice Girls 'weren't interested in pleasing men' and made music that sent a positive image to girls and women, she said.

Speaking to the Radio Times, Miss Chisholm said: 'There are some great artists out there, but sometimes we could just do with a bit more dignity.

'We need female artists to be authentic. Of course, a 20-something woman has feelings and experiences that she wants to express - but you also have to be mindful of your responsibility to young fans.'

Miss Chisholm, who split from Thomas Starr in 2012, her partner of ten years and father of Scarlet,added: 'We need to have a bigger conversation about society's obsession with celebrity. It's vulgar and narcissistic and I worry about how it affects young girls.'

The singer's comments come in the wake of growing concerns about sexual content in music videos, and with the launch of a pilot scheme to give raunchy videos shown online in the UK age ratings.

Chart-topping Blurred Lines by Robin Thicke, which featured naked models dancing, was one of the most high profile videos to raise eyebrows last year.

Artists such as Annie Lennox have condemned the 'pornographic' content of some material presented to younger fans.

'I'm all for freedom of expression, but this is clearly one step beyond, and it's clearly into the realm of porn,' Lennox has said.
