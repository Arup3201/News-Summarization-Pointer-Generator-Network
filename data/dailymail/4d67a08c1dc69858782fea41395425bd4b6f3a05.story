The Ebola outbreak risks unleashing an economic catastrophe that will leave a 'lost
generation' of West Africans, Liberian President Ellen
Johnson Sirleaf has said.

The president made a desperate appeal for help from every nation with the capacity to do so, describing the initial reaction as 'inconsistent and lacking in clear direction or urgency'.

She said the international community had woken up to the
global health risk posed by the epidemic but added that her country had been brought to 'a standstill' and was desperate for funding and medical supplies.

President EllenJohnson Sirleaf said the international community had woken up to the global health risk posed by Ebola but said her country had been brought to 'a standstill' and was desperate for medical supplies

'We all have a stake in the battle against Ebola,' President Johnson Sirleaf said
in an open letter read on the BBC World Service.

'It is the duty of all of us, as global citizens, to send a
message that we will not leave millions of West Africans to fend
for themselves against an enemy that they do not know, and
against whom they have little defence.'

She noted that Liberia and two other badly hit countries - Guinea and Sierra Leone - were already weakened by years of war.

'There is no coincidence Ebola has taken hold in three fragile states - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - all battling to overcome the effects of interconnected wars,' the leader said.

She pointed out that Liberia once had 3,000 medical doctors, but by the end of its 1989-2003 civil war the country had just 36. 

The Ebola epidemic remains out of control in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, with the death toll topping 4,500

President Johnson Sirleaf, a former senior World Bank executive, said
Ebola was having a dire economic impact in the worst affected
countries, with harvests missed, markets shut and borders
closed.  

'Ebola is not just a health crisis - across West Africa, a
generation of young people risk being lost to an economic
catastrophe,' she said. 

President Johnson Sirleaf insisted that the whole world had a stake infighting the deadly virus

'The time for talking or theorizing is
over. Only concerted action will save my country, and our
neighbours, from experiencing another national tragedy.'

The total death toll of the Ebola outbreak, first detected in March deep in the forests of southern Guinea, has risen to more than 4,500, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

Although Senegal and Nigeria have been declared Ebola-free, the epidemic remains out of control in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.

WHO warns that by December there could be as many as 10,000 new infections per week. 

The deadly virus has also reached Spain and the United States but outbreaks have been contained so far. President Barack Obama has appealed for Americans not to give in
to hysteria or fear.

Winner of the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize, President Johnson Sirleaf insisted that the whole world had a stake in
fighting the virus.

She said: 'This disease respects no borders. It is the duty of all of
us, as global citizens, to send a message that we will not leave
millions of West Africans to fend for themselves against an
enemy that they do not know, and against whom they have little
defence.'

The United Nations has established a regional headquarters for the response to Ebola in Accra, Ghana. 

The director of WHO Margaret Chan was scheduled to attend a meeting in Ghana but did not make any public appearances, cancelling a scheduled press conference Saturday. 

Ms Chan and WHO have come under scrutiny following an internal document obtained by The Associated Press which said the UN health organization did not respond adequately to contain the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.

President Johnson Sirleaf appealed to the international community not to leave millions of West Africans to fight the disease alone, as Ebola knows 'no borders' and it is the duty of all people to battle the virus

Still reeling from the effects of a devastating civil war, Liberia is ill-equipped to dead with the Ebola epidemic
