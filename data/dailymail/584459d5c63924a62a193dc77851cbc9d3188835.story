Eighty-six current and former members of Yale University fraternity Sigma Phi Epsilon are being sued over a fatal crash at the 2011 Harvard-Yale football game.

Sig Ep brother Brendan Ross, then 21, was driving a U-haul van full of kegs to the frat's spot near the Yale football field on November 19 when the vehicle sped up and hit three women.

Nancy Barry, a 30-year-old student from Salem, Massachusetts, died in the crash. Yale student Sarah Short and Harvard employee Elizabeth Dernbach were also injured.

Fatal: 30-year-old Nancy Barry died after being hit by a U-Haul van driven by a Sigma Phi Epsilon brother in 2011. Her estate and one of the other women injured are filing new lawsuits against all 86 men who were members of the fraternity at the time

Crash: Sig Ep brother Brendan Ross, then 21, was behind the wheel of a U-Haul van when he sped up and hit three women at the 2011 Harvard-Yale football game

Someone to blame: Representatives for Barry's estate and Ms Short were forced to file a lawsuit against all the men who were members of the frat at the time since the national organization refused to take responsibility for the incident

Ms Short and Barry's family have filed new lawsuits against all 86 men who were Sig Ep members at the time of the crash after the fraternity's national organization denied responsibility in the incident.

'Obviously, suing 86 fraternity brothers isn’t what we wanted to do,' Paul Edwards, the attorney representing Barry’s estate, told the New Haven Register. 'But the national fraternity organization was claiming this wasn’t a Sigma Phi Epsilon-sponsored event. This clearly was a fraternity-sponsored event.'

Legally, the national organization says, it has nothing to do with the local chapter which isn't covered by their insurance.

Joel Faxon, the attorney representing Ms Short, told the Yale Daily News that he has never in his 20 years of litigation seen a national organization shirk from protecting its local chapter.

But Mr Edwards believes the national organization has stepped up partially since 84 of the brothers being sued are being represented by the same lawyer - Jeremy Platek of White Plains, New York.

Shirking responsibility: Sig Ep's national chapter says it legally has nothing to do with the local Yale chapter, which doesn't fall under their insurance either

Stepping up: But it seems the national chapter is helping the current and former brothers who are defendants in the case since most of them are being represented by one lawyer

Pay out: The new lawsuits are expected to be in court for a number of years. If awarded damages, the men will most likely pay with their parent's automobile or homeowner's insurance

Damages: Barry's estate is hoping to get several million dollars in the suit, while Ms Short is going after seven figures to cover her more than $300,000 in medical bills

'I would be surprised if all the fraternity members had collectively gotten together and decided to hire one lawyer on such short notice,' Mr Edwards said. 'The odds are very high that he was appointed to represent them by the national fraternity.'

The men started making their first court appearances between January 6 and 14 and the trial is expected to last a number of years.

Barry's estate is seeking several million dollars in the lawsuit, while Ms Short hopes to get seven figures to cover her more than $300,000 in medical bills.

Representatives of Barry and Ms Short's estate have filed a total of four lawsuits including suits against the university, City of New Haven and other parties.

There is a possibility that the four lawsuits may be joined into one in the future.

If Barry and Short are awarded damages, they will most likely be paid with money from the brothers' parent's automobile or homeowner's insurance.

Ross, the brother who actually hit the women, had criminal charges against him dropped and avoided prison time by pleading guilty to driving unreasonably fast and unsafe starting.

At the time, one witness told police Ross pressed the pedal in annoyance when the women were not moving fast enough, the New Haven Register reported.

Another witness was grilling sirloin tips when he heard the crash and saw two people lying on the ground.

'The driver looked shocked. Absolutely
 shocked. He didn't look intoxicated or anything like that. He had a 
dazed look like he had just hit someone,' said Tim Walker of Pawtucket, Rhode Island.

After the crash, Ross passed a field sobriety test and he remained cooperative with authorities throughout their investigation. In court, prosecutors said Ross was 'appropriately remorseful'.

Drinking games: The annual Harvard-Yale game is a boozy event that usually involves a lot of drinking before hand in the lots surrounding the stadium

'Brendan Ross is an 
outstanding young man who was involved in a tragic accident,' his attorney William Dow III said 
in a statement. 'He will emerge from this without a criminal record, but
 the memory of that tragedy remains. Brendan and his family have 
extended their condolences to Ms. Barry's family when the accident 
occurred. Ms. Barry remains in their prayers.

‘She was an angel - and I'm not just 
saying that - an absolute angel, and we don't know why this happened to 
her,’ Barry's grandmother Nancy St. Pierre, also of Salem, told the 
Hartford Courant

At the annual Yale-Harvard game, 
tailgating is nearly as storied as the competition itself. Elaborate 
buffets dot the car parks and fans frequently fill U-Haul trucks 
with kegs, grills and hard alcohol but the university has since calmed down festivities.

Following the fatal crash, the university has banned kegs at athletic events. Oversized vehicles like the U-haul van in the crash have been barred from athletic events unless pre-approved for use by a vendor.

Changes: Following the accident, the university has calmed down festivities at the annual game by banning kegs. Over-sized vehicles like the U-haul in the crash are only allowed to be used by vendors now
