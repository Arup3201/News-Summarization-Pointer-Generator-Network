Netflix is a waste of money because you won't be able to watch new shows, according to financial comparison website Finder.com.au.

Michelle Hutchison, the site's money expert, claims that the booming Internet TV market is littered with traps and Netflix isn't really worth it, yet.

'With the recent launch of Netflix and other providers in Australia, there is a lot of hype about the value of streaming TV shows and movies over the internet,' she said.

'But is it really worth it?

'Buying Netflix is a bad idea .. because you won't get some of the biggest shows like The Walking Dead and you might not have enough data to download the "unlimited" shows,' she said.

Finder.com.au is far from impressed by the Netflix offerings in Australia, claiming it's not value for money

Netflix announced its pricing today for film and TV fans in Australia, would include many acclaimed shows like House of Cards but Finder.com.au says fans will have to wait for a while for other new shows and it's not value for money

The entire Netflix catalogue was leaked on the internet as it revealed the streaming service costs but a financial comparison website says there's not enough new material on offer

 Michelle Hutchison, money expert for Finder.com.au, has claimed the streaming service is a waste of  money

Ms Hutchison also claims that: 'It could damage the Australian film and TV industry and you won't be able to watch it on your TV unless it's hooked up to a computer or Apple TV or Google chromecast.'

'Netflix and other internet TV providers pose a concerning threat to Australia's already struggling film and TV industry, as more Australians will make the mass migration off free-to-air and pay TV and onto this new way of viewing.

'If fewer Aussie eyeballs are on traditional TV, the stations will struggle to compete with licencing and potentially close up shop for good.

Finder says it's not all bad news, Finder said while there is no value for money for the grown-ups viewing pleasure, parents could save thousands of dollars on children’s entertainment, including DVDs and pay TV subscriptions, with the Australian launch of Netflix

'This could limit the opportunities that Australia's entertainers have, including other talented people in direction, production, writers and film makers.'

Netflix officials say their product 'is available on thousands of Internet connected devices, not just the ones mentioned'.

'We’re also available on smart TVs, Blu-ray and home theatre systems, games consoles, smart phones and tables. Devices many people already own.' 

Finder.com.au/internet-tv claims to have launched the most comprehensive guide about Internet TV in Australia and since its launch on Monday we've seen almost 50,000 visits by Australians wanting to compare deals and buy Internet enabled TVs and products.

'Netflix (like the others) is a metered video streaming service so your allowed usage will be affected,' Finder reports.

'Keep in mind that streaming in HD uses a higher bandwidth and will affect your usage at a faster rate than watching videos in standard definition will.

'They are fairly similar in price but what you get for that price can differ quite significantly. Besides the difference in TV shows, for the packages $10 and under, some have from 1 and up to 3 devices you can stream shows at the same time.

'Generally speaking, the more you pay the better picture quality and more devices you can use at the one time.'

Netflix says: 'We were the pioneers in adaptive bit rate streaming, it was created to aid markets with lesser broadband infrastructure and is one of our key features.'

The price variations amongst the providers are indicative of a number of features that you should investigate and consider before making a choice:

In most cases, the Internet TV offerings, will eat into download quotas.

'You will need to contact your Internet Service Provider in order to find out which ones,' she added.

'For example, some companies allow for unmetered viewing of catch-up TV programming like that offered by ABC’s iView.

'With other providers that are metered you should note that a 60 minute program can potentially consume up to 300MB of data.

'When making the switch to Internet television you also need to consider how well your devices and the platform are able to stream videos. If your Internet connection is too slow, TV shows and movies will not stream to your device continuously.

'Instead, you will be left waiting while the device struggles to catch up. Some content, like HD, also requires a higher speed connection then others.'

Netflix has, however, structured agreements with iinet and Optus offering unmetered access. 

But it's not all bad news, Finder said while there is no value for money for the grown-ups viewing pleasure, parents could save thousands of dollars on children’s entertainment, including DVDs and pay TV subscriptions, with the Australian launch.

It has found that the cost of buying all 213 kids TV shows available on Netflix would cost an estimated $4,221.76, which equates to 469 months or 39 years worth of the basic Netflix monthly subscription of $8.99.

Netflix launched in Australia on 24 March from AU$8.99 a month for a basic package

The launch of Netflix ushers in what is arguably the biggest change to the Australian TV landscape in decades.

But the online streaming services will still have to convince Australians - who are among the most prolific illegal downloaders in the world - to pay for content.

This could prove difficult, with a new Canstar Blue survey finding that the majority of Australians are still not willing to pay for TV content.

About one in five are willing to pay up to $20 a month for a service that provides a majority of content they would like to see.

But this could change in future, with the survey also finding that 23 per cent of young Australians are already utilising online streaming services.
