One of the world’s rarest orchids has been discovered by British botanists on a volcanic island in the Atlantic.

Professor Richard Bateman and Dr Paula Rudall, experts from the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, found the green-flowered plant on a wind-swept mountain ridge they compared to a scene from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Lost World.

There were only 250 plants of the unique species on the island of Sao Jorge in the Portuguese Azores, making the newly named Hochstetter Butterfly Orchid the rarest in Europe.

Incredibly, on their return to Britain the scientists realised that another botanist had first seen the orchid 175 years ago - but had never realised what he had discovered.

Browsing the library at Kew Gardens, they realised that a German explorer, 20-year-old Karl Hochstetter, found the plant when he visited the Azores, 850 miles off the Portuguese coast, in 1838.

Professor Bateman said: ‘Hochstetter collected just one specimen and dried it.

‘He gave it to his father, the world-renowned botanist Christian Ferdinand Hochstetter, who totally misunderstood both the specimen and what its significance was.’

Hochstetter Snr confused the orchid with a closely related species, accurately drawing the plant in his 1844 book on the islands but mislabelling it.

Professor Bateman added: ‘He confused specimens. The real problem was that the father, a very experienced botanist, never visited the island.

‘He never saw these plants living - he just saw a squashed specimen.

‘He messed up completely in describing this orchid and it disappeared from everyone’s view for the last 170-odd years.’

The botanist added: ‘This remarkable species languished unrecognised for all that time.’

The British botanists and their Azores-based colleague Monica Moura , who have published their work in the journal PeerJ, debated whether to publicise the discovery at all.

‘One concern was that plant collectors would seek this orchid out and even dig it out,’ said Professor Bateman.

‘But we decided there was a real need to make people aware of this so conservation work can be carried out.’

Each plant - although not as colourful or vivid as tropical orchids - could be worth a substantial sum to collectors.

But Prof Bateman warned that the plant would be unlikely to survive outside its natural habitat.The plant - which has been given the formal Latin name of Platanthera azorica - only lives in two volcanic craters a mile apart on a windy ridge.

The team found it only grows in a narrow band between the altitudes of 950m and 1,000m.‘It likes wet, acid soil and a very humid climate,’ Prof Bateman said.

‘It is very exposed up there on that ridge and the wind really whistles through. You would have to really know what you were doing to recreate those conditions.’
