Alan Pardew has called for more consistent punishments after Crystal Palace captain Mile Jedinak was retrospectively banned for four matches.

Video footage showed the 30-year-old to have elbowed West Ham striker Diafra Sakho towards the end of the Eagles' 3-1 win at Upton Park on Saturday.

Jedinak was charged with violent conduct by the Football Association - a decision which irked manager Pardew, although the Australia international accepted it.

The midfielder missed the Eagles' late 1-0 defeat at Southampton as a result and will also sit out the upcoming Premier League matches against QPR, Stoke and Manchester City.

'Well, you kind of know as a manager that (given) the way it was sort of damned on TV that something was going to happen and that's where we are,' Pardew said.

'We haven't appealed so we will take the decision, but we want some consistency in it.

Although the officials didn't see the incident, the TV cameras did and Jedinak was condemned by the pundits

'I could name three or four incidents this year where Crystal Palace should have had a player sent off against them retrospectively.

'But it wasn't highlighted by the media and therefore it went under the radar, so to speak. This one didn't.'

Asked another question on the subject, Pardew retorted: 'I don't want to go any further. I've said my point on that.'
