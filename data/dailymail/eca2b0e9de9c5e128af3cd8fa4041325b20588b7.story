Last night the website for the Carter Thor acting school returned a 'page not found' message.

Active as recently as two weeks ago, it featured a biography of Thor which said he had been an acting coach for almost 20 years.

Testimonials on the website, viewed by MailOnline as of May 17 through an internet archive, came from famous acting names including Sean Penn and Wentworth Miller.

The site had a designated section for teen classes, adding: 'We work on every level of material with our young people while being careful to stay within the boundaries that are a natural extension of our student’s age range.

Thor is accused of consulting with the 13-year-old for acting classes in 2008 before driving to a secluded LA suburb and assaulting her. The abuse is alleged to have continued for 11 months

'The Teen Class uses scenes from film
 and television and includes scenes from popular shows on typical young 
people’s networks but to be completely focused on material from these 
popular networks would limit the young actor.

'The Carter Thor Studio Teen Class keeps its class sizes tight and personal.

'Each young actor is attended to as an individual, but each member of the Teen Class is welcome to attend all the Studio events and special guests.'

Thor, who was born in Los Angeles, began his acting career in the late 1980's by appearing as minor characters in a few films.

He starred in romantic comedy Curly Sue in 1991 as well as Steven Spielberg's Peter Pan adaptation Hook, with Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman.

His most notable role was that of Jurassic Park antagonist Dr Lewis Dodgson, who bribes the character Dennis Nedry - played by Seinfeld actor Wayne Knight -  to steal dinosaur embryos from the Jurassic Park laboratory.

Thor also appeared as a soldier in a A Few Good Men and  in two episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation.

He also has some directing credits, such as the 2000 comedy-drama After Sex starring Brooke Shields.

A request for comment to the acting studio was not immediately returned.
