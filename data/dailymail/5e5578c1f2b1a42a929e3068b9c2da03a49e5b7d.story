EU funding intended to help disaster victims has been diverted to the Mafia, according to a report by the European Parliament.

Money for relief and reconstruction efforts following a devastating earthquake in the Italian city of L’Aquila were ‘misused’ and relayed to companies with links to organised crime, it warns.

More than £450million from the EU’s Solidarity Fund went to L’Aquila after the 2009 earthquake, which destroyed thousands of homes and left more than 300 people dead.

The central Italian city of L'Aquila was devastated by a 5.9 magnitude 
earthquake in 2009. Now it has been revealed that EU cash for disaster 
relief and reconstruction may have fallen into the hands of the Mafia

Subcontractors were required to have mafia-free certification.

But in a draft report on the effectiveness of this aid, Danish MEP Soren Bo Sondergaard reported serious allegations that part of the money was paid to companies with 'direct or indirect ties' to organised crime.

Wanted criminals were even discovered at one premises rebuilt with EU funds, it found.

The report also highlighted allegations by Anti-mafia prosecutor Olga Capasso that the funding had made L'Aquila the country's greatest challenge in combatting the mafia.

centre of L'Aquila, which remains uninhabitable, is expected to take 25 
years to rebuild

She said: ‘Among the problems related to combating organised crime, Aquila is one of the biggest problems at national level'.

The document also criticised work carried out as faulty, dangerous and unhealthy with poor quality or flammable building materials used.

The highly critical report accuses the European Commission of negligence and of allowing fraud to take place on its watch.

But the Commission rejected the allegation of misuse and insisted their distribution had been 'monitored carefully'.

The huge quake killed more than 300 people and left thousands homeless.
