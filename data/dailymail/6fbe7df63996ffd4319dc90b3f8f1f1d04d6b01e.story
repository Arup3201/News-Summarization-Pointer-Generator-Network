A small airplane has crashed in the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant in northeast Louisiana.

Ron Phillips, the director of Monroe Regional Airport, told The News-Star that the pilot was injured in the crash on Tuesday and was believed to be the only person aboard.

The plane was upside down in the parking lot of a McDonald's but there were no reports of injuries on the ground.

The News-Star reported that it left Carmi Municipal Airport in southeastern Illinois and crashed at 10:55am today.

The pilot suffered 'serious' injuries and was airlifted to a nearby hospital by helicopter.

The plane was registered to Illinois resident Donald R. Jones and part of the fleet owned by WFO Flying Service, but it is unclear if he was the pilot at the time of the crash.

Ron Phillips said: 'Part of the plane is up against the McDonald's sign post and it looks like maybe one car was damaged.

'The plane broke apart but it doesn't seem like any other major damage to any facilities around.'

The cause of the crash is unknown at this time.
