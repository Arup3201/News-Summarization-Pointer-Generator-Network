He is a national treasure beloved by millions of women - and a fair few men - worldwide.

He opened the British Olympics in a James Bond inspired boat scene along the Thames last year and was a guest at the Royal Wedding.

More recently the country's most famous pants wearer was beamed on to the White Cliffs of Dover as part of a H&M marketing stunt to promote his new intimates range.

And now the company behind David Beckham's er, gigantic behind, is giving mere mortals the opportunity to be shone onto the national landmark (tight white briefs optional).

All white: The football star was projected onto the famous landmark as part of a H&M campaign

Projection Advertising, whose  impressive illumination was part of PR 
activity to promote Beckham's body wear line in February, are offering a 100m space of cliff to the public as a prize for a limited time.

For anyone looking for an original way to propose, this could be your chance. Budding artists will be pleased to know that it isn't just photographs that can be projected, but artwork too.

The company is accepting email or Twitter entries before June 2nd and will choose 100 winners to receive 15 minutes of fame up on one of Britain's most beloved landmarks.

'This is the perfect opportunity to show off your best photos, share a special message or surprise your mum,' claims the company.

The White Cliffs of Dover are cliffs which form part of the English coastline

They face the Strait of Dover and France

The face reaches 350 feet (110 m) and they spread both east and west from Dover in Kent

They are extremely symbolic because, historically, they have served as a symbolic guard against invasions

They are also the first or last sight for those travelling to and from the UK because crossing at Dover was the primary route to the continent before air travel was developed
