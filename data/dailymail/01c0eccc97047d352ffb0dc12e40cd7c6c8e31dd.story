Threat: PC Hatef Nezami, 48, rang colleagues at the police Special Branch office with a coded message that a device was placed in a busy port

A police officer caused a major terrorism alert after ringing a busy port with a hoax bomb threat.

PC Hatef Nezami, 48, rang colleagues at the police Special Branch office with a coded message that a device was placed in a busy port.

Specialist terrorism staff were so concerned by the call's authentic nature that they started preparing for a full terrorist attack.

The constable, who has completed a regional Special Branch terrorism course, said that a bomb was on a Condor ferry based in Poole, Dorset.

However at the time of his call, the ferry was actually sailing across the English Channel packed full of people travelling to the Channel Islands.

Mr Nezami is believed to have tried to call back to reveal his 'joke' call but was unable to do so for half an hour as staff were engaged on all the available phone lines alerting authorities.

Remarkably, the Daily Mail understands that Mr Nezami, who has worked as a detective, has not faced criminal or disciplinary proceedings and was simply placed on uniform patrol at another station.

The maximum penalty for making a hoax bomb threat is a prison sentence of seven years.

Mr Nezami was seen leaving his 
three-bedroom townhouse in Bournemouth in police uniform before 
travelling to a local police station on two days last week.

It
is a major embarrassment for Dorset Police which is currently in a 
major security operation patrolling the upcoming Olympic sailing events 
in nearby Weymouth.

All officers have had leave cancelled and specialist firearms teams from forces across the country have been drafted in to patrol the stretch of water near where the bomb hoax was said to be.

Senior officers in the force are 
frustrated that the matter has not been taken further and believe a 
criminal investigation should be launched.

One
said: 'It's an absolute disgrace that something like this can happen 
from one of our own officers and it's swept under the carpet.

'A lot of senior brass don't want anything to happen to embarrass the force so close to the Olympics.

'Odd': Patrick Mercer, chairman of the Terrorism sub-committee, said if the allegations proved to be true it was 'very odd' that Mr Nezami had not already been prosecuted

'One
officer even joked that he was "testing out the systems" and that has 
been given as the official line if anyone questions the incident.

'It
would have been a totally different story if this was a member of the 
public doing this just weeks away from the biggest security operation in
Dorset's history.'

Patrick
Mercer, chairman of the Terrorism sub-committee, said: 'If these 
allegations prove to be true then it seems to me very odd that this 
officer has not been prosecuted.

'I feel that the Home Secretary should step in and look at this.'

Mr
Nezami refused to deny the allegations when asked three times. He said:
'I'm not willing to speak to you on this or any other matter.'

Both the Independent Police Complaints Commission and Dorset Police Authority were unaware of the incident when contacted.

A Dorset Police spokesman said: 'We're going to say no comment to anything to do with this enquiry.'

Chief
Inspector Steve White declined to give details on whether there was a 
criminal investigation into the bomb hoax or if disciplinary proceedings
had taken place.

He said: 'Dorset Police does not comment on internal staff matters.'

This
week the force referred itself to the police watchdog for failing to 
find a couple who had died after a landslip crushed their car in 
Beamister tunnel, Dorset, for nine days.
