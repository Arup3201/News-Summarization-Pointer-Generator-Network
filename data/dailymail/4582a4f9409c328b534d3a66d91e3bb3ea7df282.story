A waitress has been fired for ranting about a bad tipper on her Facebook page - not realizing that she was Facebook friends with the customer in question.

Mother-of-one Kirsten Kelly, 22, said she was stunned when she learned the 'friend' printed off her Facebook message and took it to her bosses at the Texas Roadhouse in Findlay, Ohio.

The message said, 'If you come into a 
restaurant and spend $50 or more, you should be able to tip 
appropriately for that,' Kelly told WTOL11, adding that she didn't identify the person or the place.

Still, her managers weren't happy about it.

Fired: Kirsten Kelly lost her restaurant job on Monday after she complained on Facebook about bad tippers - not realizing that she had been at school with one of them and they were Facebook friends

'They told me that I knew what I was doing when I posted that, and they would have to let me go,' Kelly said. 'They were really upset.'

She explained that she had made the angry post after she left with only $60 following a busy Friday night at the restaurant.

'I was mad,' she said. 'I had several people that night who 
weren't tipping appropriately. More than one time, people spent $50 or 
more and they tipped five or six (dollars). That's not OK.'

After posting the message, one of her customers - a former schoolmate and Facebook friend - saw it and went to the restaurant.

Kicked out: The Facebook friend printed off the Facebook post and took it to Kelly's bosses at the Texas Roadhouse in Ohio where she worked. They say she used derogatory terms in the message

Kelly said she was shocked when they fired her.

'I knew that they could have yelled at me for that, but I didn't think they could fire me for posting that,' she said.

As she worries about how she will provide for her young son, she says she hopes she will get a job in customer service soon - and vows to be more careful with what she posts online.

The Facebook post has since been deleted.

The 
Texas Roadhouse explained that Kelly was fired for using a 
derogatory name to refer to the customer. Their policy states that workers can not mention the restaurant on social media.
