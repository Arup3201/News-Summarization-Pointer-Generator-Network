President of Argentina Cristina Kirchner, who has strongly denied covering up an Iranian bombing of a Jewish centre in 1994 

Argentina has called on its Congress to dissolve its intelligence services following the death of a prosecutor who was due to accuse President Cristina Kirchner of covering up an Iranian bombing.

In a nationally televised address, Kirchner strongly denied that she had sought to shield former Iranian officials suspected of the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community centre.

Her appearance was the first since the death of prosecutor Alberto Nisman, who mysteriously died hours before he was due to give potentially explosive testimony on the alleged cover-up.

During the address, she said her proposal to create a new spy agency would be presented to lawmakers by the end of the week.

She did not say who might have killed Mr Nisman, but in recent letters posted on social media, she had suggested that rogue intelligence agents may have orchestrated the death in a plot against the government.

In the speech, she provided no new details of the alleged plot and Kirchner herself oversees the intelligence agencies in question.

Speaking while sitting in a wheelchair due to a fractured ankle, she said: 'It's unreasonable to think our government could even be suspected of such a maneuver.

'I will not be extorted, I am not afraid' of being cited by judges or denounced by investigators, she added.

'They will not make me move even a centimeter from what I have always thought..

She also added that reforming the clandestine services was a 'national debt' the South American country has had since the return of democracy in 1983.

Argentina had several years of a brutal dictatorship, and Kirchner suggested that the problems of today had their roots in the years of that military government.

While government officials had previously labeled Mr Nisman's allegations as absurd, Monday's speech was the first time Fernandez had taken them on directly.

Mr Nisman, 51, was found dead earlier this month in the bathroom of his apartment with a bullet in his right temple and a .22 caliber gun next to him.

His death came days after he gave a judge a report alleging Kirchner secretly reached a deal to prevent prosecution of former Iranian officials accused of involvement in the 1994 bombing of Argentina's largest Jewish centre.

The attack killed 85 people and injured more than 200. She allegedly reached the deal in exchange for economic and trade benefits with Iran.

Iran has denied the accusation.

Mr Nisman's death has produced anti-government protests and a myriad of conspiracy theories, ranging from suicide to the involvement of Iranian intelligence agents.

Kirchner, 61, said the new 'Federal Intelligence Agency' would have a director and deputy, and only a few in government would have access to the agency heads, apparently a critique of a system where many in Congress have contact with intelligence officials. 

But Argentina's political opposition have criticised the president's latest comments.

Margarita Stolbizer, an opposition member of Congress told Todo Noticias: 'The government should explain the 11 years it has managed the security services.

'The speech was filled with imprecise (statements) and lies.

'She did not give answers to the doubts about this government nor about the content of Nisman's denouncement.'
