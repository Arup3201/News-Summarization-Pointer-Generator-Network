Almost a century on, footage has surfaced of a freak boating disaster that killed 844 people traveling to a company picnic  in Chicago.

On the morning of July 24, 1915 the SS Eastland capsized while it was still docked in around 20ft of water. Many of the victims were children and teenagers, who drowned while wearing their Sunday best.

Two newly-discovered grainy black and white clips of the incident show workers trying to right the luxury vessel, with survivors huddled together shivering in blankets.

All hands on deck: On July 24, 1915 the SS Eastland capsized while it was still docked in an estimated 20 feet of water. Many of the victims were children and teenagers, who were dressed in their Sunday best

There were a total of 2,500 passengers on board that fateful day. 

Western Electric had chartered the Eastland and other ships to take employees from its Hawthorne factory in Cicero, Illinois, to a summer party in Michigan City, Indiana. At the time the company had around 10,000 staff.

The Eastland - which launched in 1903 - had a reputation for being unstable  and its licensed capacity had been reduced several times in a bid to balance it out.

Many blamed its eventual sinking on a case of overcrowding. After being salvaged, the shipwrecked Eastland was sold to the U.S. Navy.

It was renovated and renamed the USS Wilmette as a designated gunboat.

She was primarily used for training purposes on the Great Lakes and scrapped after World War II

Jeff Nichols, a doctoral student at the University of Illinois at Chicago, told CBS News that he found the videos of the Eastland while he was looking through seemingly unrelated material on World War I.

He was using the website http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en, which gathers digitized memorabilia and personal stories from individuals.

The Eastland Disaster Historical Society says the film Nichols discovered on Europeana humanizes the tragedy in a new way.

Ted Wachholz, the organisation's executive director said: 'The film footage . . . is the single most important discovery from research over the past 100 years for those who are interested in the history of the Eastland Disaster.

'Over the past 16 years, EDHS has pursued numerous leads, driven hundreds of miles, sent emails, and made phone calls all while responding to reports of possible film footage of the Eastland Disaster. 

'All of these previous leads have ended without any results. Late Friday, however, Mr. Nichols was gracious enough to share his discovery on our Facebook page.

'All of us at EDHS and many more who follow us have gotten chills upon viewing this incredible footage, and we know that thousands more will experience the same.'

Caroline Homolka, 17, was among the victims of the Eastland sinking. She and her brother Joe both worked for Western Electric and were getting ready to attend the picnic and decided to go separately with their own friends.

New pastures: After being salvaged, the boat was sold to the U.S. Navy

Victims: Agnes Latowski  was an employee of the Western Electric company and was aboard the Eastland along with her older brother Walter and older sister Nellie who both perished

Joe was rescued but Caroline was killed. Her sister Blanche recalled the heartbreaking chain of events: 'I'll never forget that evening. Joe was home by then exhausted as were poor Mother and Daddy.

'We kids couldn't imagine such a tragedy. I even remember there was a shortage of coffins and so when my dear sister Carrie was brought home, they had placed her on a sort of wicker sofa. She lay there as beautiful as ever. 

'Oh poor Carrie, we were told that she must have fallen when the boat tipped over because she had a dark bruise, and that it killed her instantly

'There she lay, and she had a death pall over her face. It was brought home to rest every time we sat at the table and there was one missing, at every meal, one missing.' 

Marion Eichholz, the last known survivor of the Eastland ship disaster, died last November aged 102.

This year marks the 100th anniversary of the accident.
