Another shocking photo has emerged on social media that have been encouraged by a Melbourne jihadist, who has clearly shown his support of Islamic State's recruitment of young children.

Mounir Raad re-tweeted a disturbing picture of two young boys, covered head to toe with only their eyes showing, dressed for combat, holding automatic rifles. 

The caption of the tweet, which appeared on the twitter account of another extremist says 'There is no life without jihad' (Daulatul islam Baqiyyah!)

Mounir Raad who has associated himself with the Islamic State has claimed he is in Aleppo, Syria.

He is believed to have travelled to the country alongside teenager Adam Daham who killed five people in a suicide bombing.

Monash University Global Terrorism Research Centre director Professor Greg Barton told the Herald Sun the tweet, was almost seen as a 'badge of honour'.

'In jihadi culture, in a wide range of groups, there is a strong sense of encouraging kids to identify with a military culture as a way forward,' he said. 

Raad's twitter account has also been filled with a variety of comments giving insight into life under the IS group, which strangely include eating a pot of noodles.

'Mmmmmmm noodles! I feel like a chef,' Raad tweeted.

'We say alhamdulilah for the blessings of Allah s.w.t in some other parts of shaam (Syria) they're eating cats n dogs,' he said.

Raad also tweeted a picture of the noodles, indicating what he was eating was obviously a luxury compared with what other fighters had to eat.

He also tweeted another pro Islamic State comment which appears to show his allegiance to the extremist group.

'May Allah shower patience upon the mujahideen and keep there feet firm against there enemies and give them victory over the kuffar,' it read. 

'The whole game plan for the Islamic State is finding foreign fighters but so many of them are idiots, it is a double-edged sword,' Professor Barton told the Herald Sun.

Calling them soft and immature he said most 'turn up with a head full of ideas and not much to offer in terms of fighting.' 

The photo of the two young boys comes just a day after another sickening photo emerged on social media showing a toddler kicking the severed head of a dead soldier in Syria.

It's believed the toddler's father is an avid Islamic State supporter and is seen wearing a camouflage military style baseball cap on his head.

The father can be seen smiling with delight in the photo as he watches his innocent child kick the severed head.

Leaning over, the bearded man, appears to be helping his young child to raise their small leg and kick the rotting head of the dead body, which appears to be the head of a dead prisoner.

Both photos are a long line of disturbing images which have recently emerged.

It's believed he fled to Syria via Malaysia using his brother's passport last year and is wanted for terrorism offences.

Even his sister has labelled his actions to fight under Islamic state as 'abhorrent' and  'repugnant'. 

It has also been revealed that as many as 250 Australians could be backing or be in combat with the jihadist group, despite previous claims that the number fighting with Islamic State was only 70.
