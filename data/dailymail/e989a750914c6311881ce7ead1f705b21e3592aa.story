A couple with a record-breaking family were buried together today - with many of their 130-plus grandchildren looking on. 

Hans and Josie Schaffer, who died three days apart, had so many grandchildren and great-grandchildren they had difficulty keeping track of them. 

Son Jonathan - one of their 11 children - said at the last count he thought there were 'between 130 and 140' - living in the UK, Australia and America.

Scores of them flew to Britain to say their farewells to the couple - and had to arrive in shifts to pay their last respects. 

Relatives said that Hans, 92, passed away with a broken heart just 72 hours after his wife Josie, who was 83 and suffering from dementia and a chest infection. 

Jonathan, 55, said his father lay next to her as he said his goodbyes and at that point gave up his three-year battle with stomach cancer.

The couple made headlines in 2008 when their family numbered 56 grandchildren and 43 great-grandchildren. 

At the time Josie said: 'We worked hard at our family, we were told, in the days of feather mattresses, when you have a row with your spouse you shake the bed and get back in it.' 

In the six years since, it has grown even bigger although none of their children seem to have an exact figure on its size.

Hans and Josie, who lived in a bungalow in Bedford, had been together since WW2 when Hans was a German prisoner of war in a camp in Worcestershire and Josie was 14. 

They met when her bike got a puncture outside the camp and he helped her out and they got talking.

Hans was released in 1947 and they got married and had their first child in 1948, before moving to Swindon, Wilts. 

Jonathan, a car mechanic, said: 'I think they had it planned, they were soul-mates who were utterly devoted to one another. 

'They were inseparable. 

'The longest they were ever apart was in the three weeks before they died, and they were just in separate bedrooms in their house. 

'They made us promise they would stay together, so we made sure they were treated at home. 

'I know they could feel each others' presence through the walls and that kept them going. 

'When mum passed, dad was very ill but he understood and we put him in the bed with her so they could lay together.

'He said his goodbyes, you could see the sadness in his eyes, he was heartbroken. 

'It was then that he gave up. 

'He was given six months to live in 2011 and he survived for three years, he was a fighter. 

'That's how I know he really died of a broken heart.' 

After his release from the camp, Hans spent years working as a farmer, before working for Vauxhall as a welder and assembler. 

Josie looked after their children full-time and each year, the family took a trip to eastern Germany to visit Hans' relatives. 

Altogether they had 13 children, but two - Shirleen, born in 1948, and Carleen, born in 1961, died at birth. 

The other children are Shannette, 65, Roberta, 63, Veronica, 62, Bernadette, 61, Paul 60, Katrina, 58, Adrian, 56, Jonathan, 55, Carl, 54, Donna, 50 and Stephen, 48.

In the 1980's, the couple moved to Perth, Australia but returned to the UK 13 years ago and settled in Bedford to retire. 

The family has grown so large that Jonathan says it has become incredibly hard for them all to keep in touch. 

Jonathan, who lives in Bedford, said: 'We are spread all over the world. 

'There are three in Australia, two in America, but we love having a large family. 

'It was hectic and always a mad rush in our house, but there were so many funny times and my parents loved to have a laugh. 

'My dad used to play cards for money, he really enjoyed playing cards, I don't think there would have been food on the table if he hadn't've. 

'They will be dearly missed by all of us.'
