The more than 3,000 passengers on the stricken cruise ship stuck off the coast of Mexico have turned into 'savages' and are fighting over food, relatives have claimed.

Those on board have no power and have been forced to sleep on deck in tents as there is no air conditioning in their sweltering cabins.

The toilets are also not working meaning that passengers have had to make do with bags or buckets.

Not smiling anymore: Brent Nutt, husband of Carnival cruise passenger Bethany Nutt, both pictured here, said that fights were breaking out over food onboard the nightmare holiday ship.

Brent Nutt, whose wife Bethany is on board, claimed that brawling had started because some passengers have got so hungry and food is so scarce.

At least one person has also been transferred off the ship because they are in need of dialysis and can't wait for the power to come back on.

The Carnival Triumph was left stranded 150 miles off the coast of Mexico after a fire broke out in the engine room.

By Monday afternoon, some of the ship's power had been restored, but not enough to get the disabled ship moving again.

Although none of the 3,150 passengers and 1,100 crew were injured, the ship was adrift off southern Yucatan peninsula for an entire day before a tugboat arrived.

The Carnival Triumph, owned by Carnival Cruise Lines, is now being taken to Mobile, Alabama, where it is expected to arrive on Thursday, the company's President and CEO, Gerry Cahill, said in a statement.

Mr Cahill added: 'All guests on the current Carnival Triumph voyage will receive a full refund for the cruise, along with transportation expenses.

'In addition, they will receive a 
future cruise credit equal to the amount paid for this voyage, as well 
as reimbursement of all shipboard purchases during the voyage, with the 
exception of gift shop and casino charges.'

'We're terribly sorry for the 
inconvenience, discomfort, and frustration our guests are feeling.  We 
know they expected a fantastic vacation, and clearly that is not what 
they received. Our shipboard and shoreside teams are working around the clock to care for our guests and get them home safely.'

Mr Nutt, of Angleton, Texas, said his
wife called him to say the plumbing wasn't working - but he was 
horrified by what he heard next.

He told CNN: 'She said that that would be the last phone call I was going to get. They have no power, there's no way to charge cell phones or anything.

'To hear your loved one crying saying she just wants off of the ship and it all to end.

'All of the girls in their group were calling their family members as well and they were crying. Everybody wants off of this.

'It's a big mess, there's no power, there's no toilets, there's no food - it's like a bunch of savages on there.

'People are fighting over food and stuff - that's a bunch of savages. It's ridiculous.

'Carnival has nothing at all in plan in case something like this happens.'

Asked if his wife had been given any help, Mr Nutt said: 'The only help they've got is that they told them they needed to stay on the decks or in common areas'

Writing on Cruise Critic, a cruise blog, user Clinty76, whose wife and mother-in-law are on the ship, painted a similar picture.

Stagnant: Carnival says that none of the passengers are in danger and that many of the toilets are being brought back online

No shock: Previous passengers of the Carnival Triumph said the were not surprised, citing engine trouble on past journeys. The ship's troubles on this trip has left passengers fighting over food and toilets and sleeping in tents on the decks to get out of their sweltering, air conditioner-less cabins

All safe: No person was injured in the incident but relatives of passengers described tearful phone calls with sobbing loved ones stuck onboard

He wrote that they told him: 'We are about to get supplies from another cruise ship and apparently the tug boats should be here tomorrow around noon.

'We have no power AT ALL, which means we can't use the toilets, wash our hands, or take a shower.'

On USA Today, Gary Keyes of Baton Rouge, La, wrote: 'My wife (is) on this cruise and has said the conditions were horrible. No power, no water, having to use the bathroom in bags'.

Carnival said that none of the passengers are in danger and that many of the toilets are being brought back online.

It also said that some power has been restored to the buffet, meaning that limited food and hot coffee service is being offered.

The engine room fire, which took place on Sunday morning, was quickly contained thanks to the automatic fire extinguishing system and but the ship was left to operate on emergency generator power, Carnival Cruise Lines said in a statement.

This is the latest commercial catastrophe to hit Carnival Cruise Lines, which reported it's 'most challenging year' in the history of the company in 2012.

In January last year, the Costa Concordia, a 114,500 ton luxury cruise ship operated by the Carnival-owned Costa Cruises, ran aground and sank off the Tuscan island of Giglio in Italy, killing 32 people.

Last month, Costa Cruises said Italian investigators were looking into Carnival Cruise Lines' potential responsibility for the shipwreck.

The company lost more than $310 million in full-year revenues compared to 2011 and although bookings for 2013 were at the same capacity as previous years, the company has been forced to lower their prices.

The Carnival Triumph set sail from Galveston, Texas, on Thursday, and was due back on today.

However, recent travelers with the Carnival Triumph were not surprised, San Fransisco Gate reported.

Cruise fans took to Twitter and online forums saying recent trips with the vessel had been plagued by engine problems with some experiencing delays and others prevented from reaching their destination.

A Carnival official told the paper that he was uncertain of problems on previous cruises.

Carnival said all passengers would receive a refund and ‘cruise credit equal to the amount paid for this voyage’ and the next two voyages for the ship has been cancelled.
