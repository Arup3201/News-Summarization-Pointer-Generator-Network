If it was not clear at the time, this video proves why your mother told you not to play with guns.

A Saudi man was caught on camera shooting himself in the behind with a rifle during a ceremonial dance.

The video was allegedly shot at a wedding in Saudi Arabia and emerged earlier this month.

Pain in the: A man appears to have shot himself in the buttocks with a rifle during a wedding celebration

The video shows two men sitting on a rug, apparently both holding loaded musket-type rifles, surrounded buy a ring of other men.

As the men jump into the air, one or both rifles go off and one of the men fall backwards, a large black hole in his white robe.

As other party-goers rush to his aid, he can be seen clutching his bottom in pain.

According to one YouTube comment, the muskets are ceremonial and not loaded with live ammunition, so the man was shocked but not badly injured.
