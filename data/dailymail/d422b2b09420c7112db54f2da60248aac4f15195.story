Pressure continues to grow on Jean-Claude Juncker to quit as the new president of the European Commission after it emerged he has previously boasted of striking tax deals with large corporations.

A review of his speeches while prime minister of Luxembourg revealed reportedly announced to parliament that AOL and Amazon were planning to move their European headquarters to the country thanks to favourable corporate tax conditions his government had created.

It was reported last week that Luxembourg had granted secret deals to 340 companies allowing them to avoid paying billions of pounds in tax.

Yesterday Mr Juncker launched a bizarre defence of the Luxembourg tax-dodging scandal, insisting he was not to blame despite having been its prime minister for 18 years - 15 of which were also spent acting as the country's finance minister.

Details of Mr Juncker's alleged tax deal boasts were revealed by the Wall Street Journal, who reviewed speeches he had made during his 18 year stint as prime minister of Luxembourg.

During one speech in May 2003, Mr Juncker reportedly told parliament that both AOL and Amazon had agreed to move the European wings of their businesses to the grand duchy thanks to his work selling the country internationally as having an extremely favourable tax system.

'That AOL and Amazon come to Luxembourg, that with and through them we get a new perspective to the future, is the result of a correct tax policy, of a correct infrastructure policy, but also the result of tough negotiations with the top management of the groups,' he was quoted as saying. 

'They took place in America, they took place here at home, and I did not lead them alone,' he reportedly went on to say.

The revelations come as the European Commission - which Mr Juncker has only been president of since November 1 - continues to investigate tax agreements Luxembourg made with Amazon and a subsidiary of Fiat.

In investigation centres on the accusation that Luxembourg may have helped both of these companies - as well as others - cut their taxes by shifting their profits to Luxembourg.

Despite being Luxembourg's prime minister for 18 years - 15 of which were also spent as finance minister - Mr Juncker yesterday denied being involved in shaping the tax rulings that critics say enable corporations to slash their tax bills by shifting their European operations to the country.

‘There is nothing in my past indicating that my ambition was to organise tax evasion in Europe,’ he said during a press conference, adding that he was ‘not the architect of what you could call the Luxembourgish problem’.

Instead he said it was up to the current Luxembourg government to explain the situation..

Bizarrely, he also appeared to blame the problems in Luxembourg on Britain and other countries in Europe blocking tax harmonisation across the continent.

He suggested that tax rates that ‘can sometimes lack fairness’, a problem caused by countries such as the UK not wanting to give up sovereignty over taxation. 

‘If there is insufficient tax harmonisation in Europe then this can be the result,’ he said.

Some of the world's largest firms including top British companies like Dyson are using a Luxembourg tax avoidance scheme to get out of paying billions of pounds

At the press conference yesterday, Mr Juncker admitted that as prime minister he was ‘politically responsible’ for what happened in each and every corner of the country’, but indicated he did not know the tax deals were being negotiated.

Companies such as Burberry and Dyson had their divisions in Luxembourg lend money to their operations in other countries. 

The interest payments made on these loans reduced the profits in these countries. In some cases it was claimed companies enjoyed tax rates of less than 1 per cent on profits moved into the country.

Reports about the tax breaks surfaced last week, putting Juncker immediately under immediate pressure given the European Union's headline commitment to fighting tax fraud.

Since the scandal broke, a number of European political figures have called on Mr Juncker to resign his European Commission presidency, including Tory MP Stewart Jackson
