Boris Johnson has attacked Islamists who want to impose ‘mumbo-jumbo’ sharia law on Britain.

The Mayor of London condemned as ‘bunk’ the idea that there was a clash of civilisations and warned against exaggerating the ‘plague’ of militants.

Britain should not give the killers the prize they craved most – dividing us through perpetuating the myth of a 'war', he said.

Boris Johnson, pictured during a media conference in Woolwich, said Britain should not let the killers divide the country through perpetuating a myth of a 'war'

'This is a sinister political agenda that promotes a sense of grievance and victimhood among a minority of Muslims,’ he wrote in his regular column for the Telegraph.

‘The Islamists want universal sharia law and other mumbo-jumbo.

'Above all, they want power over others and so they prey on young men who feel in some way rejected by society and they fill those young men with a horrible and deluded sense of self-importance.’

He said universities should also stop pandering to extremists by allowing segregated meetings on campus.

'The universities need to be much, much 
tougher in monitoring Islamic societies. It is utterly wrong to have 
segregated meetings in a state-funded centre of learning,' he said.

'If visiting speakers start some 
Islamist schtick - and seek to call for or justify violence - then the 
authorities need to summon the police.'

The Mayor of London said there must be a distinction between the religion of Islam and 'virus of Islamism'

Islamist preachers like Abu Qatada should be deported, according to Johnson

He added that inciters like Abu Qatada 'should be put on a plane' and those that preach hate and violence must be arrested.

Mr Johnson said there needed to be a  distinction between Islam – which gave enrichment to millions of peaceful people – and the ‘virus of Islamism’.

Islamist evangelists had no allegiance to Western society 'whose benefits systems they abuse'.

'Their avowed intent is to create a sexist and homophobic caliphate.'

And in a challenge to political apologists - including former mayor Ken Livingstone - he warned against playing the extremists' game by examining British foreign policy to look for reasons for terrorism.

'You cannot hope to solve the problem 
of Islamism by accepting their invitation to enter into some debate or 
discussion about British or American foreign policy, even if that were 
desirable. People who suggest as much are, alas, playing the game of the
 Islamists.'

He warned 
against 'exaggerating' the 'plague' of Islamists, saying they probably 
numbered in the low thousands yet there were one million Muslims in 
London alone.

'You can see how the reputation of a whole community is at risk of suffering from the actions of a tiny, tiny fraction.'

It
 was a 'fitting rebuttal of the ghastly sexism of Islamist ideology' 
that one of the firearms squad who immobilised one of the alleged 
killers had been a woman.
