A gang of 11 boys beat to death their eight-year-old classmate because they were bored, Chinese police said today.

The boys, aged between nine and 13, allegedly attacked Zhang Tai in the street just near the city of Zhangjiakou in north-west China's Hebei province.

They reportedly beat him up, before leaving his battered and bruised body lying beside the road.

Killed: Zhang Tai, eight, was beaten to death by a gang of boys near Zhangjiakou in China, police said today

Tai was taken to hospital with bruises and severe head injuries, but was later declared dead.

Today, police said the gang had confessed to killing their classmate after deciding they were bored and looking for something interesting to do.

Police spokesman, Cong Lu, said the idea had been apparently suggested by a ringleader, who had been seen with Tai and the other boys in the minutes leading up to the attack.

'We are interviewing all of the boys now to try to find out the extent to which each was involved,' she said.

Tai's grandfather, Zhang Kuo, 67, said he had left the young boy playing in the yard, but when he went out later to see him there was no sign of the child.

He said another boy had told him that Tai had gone off with a group of boys because 'they promised not to beat him any more if he agreed to go with them.'

'I was instantly worried 
because I know that one of them is a bully,' said Kuo.

'My grandson told me that he 
had to call the boy "Big Brother" and that whenever he wanted someone to
 follow him he would either threaten them, or if he couldn't threaten 
them would provide them with food from his father's shop.

'He didn't like
 my grandson because he had refused to hand over his pocket money and 
later complained to his mother.'

Tai's father Zhang Han, who works as a bricklayer, said his son had often been the victim of local bullies.

'I
 have to go to the local town to work so my son is being raised here by 
my grandfather, and without parents he was often the victim of local 
bullies,' said the 42-year-old.

'He
 told me that the pocket money I gave him was often stolen by local boys
 and he didn't like going to school because he was picked on. But I 
never realised things had got this bad.'

He added that he and Kuo are are suing both the local school for failing to stop the bullying and the parents of those involved in the alleged murder.

'When my wife left me and our son two years ago it was hard to find the strength to go on, but knowing that Tai was healthy and well helped me keep going,' he said.

'He was everything to me, and now he's gone I don't know what I'm going to do. I feel like my life has come to an end, I miss him so much.'
