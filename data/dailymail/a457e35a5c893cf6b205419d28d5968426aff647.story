Video shown in court today in connection with the Aaron Hernandez murder trial shows the former football star acting calm and collected as police execute a search warrant on his house.

Hernandez, 24, is seen lounging on a couch in his North Attleboro, Massachusetts, home, and playing with his baby daughter, as multiple authorities search his property back in June of 2013.

The search was to recover evidence as it pertained to the murder of Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional football player who had been dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancée at the time of his death.

Hernandez has been accused of his murder, for which he has entered a plea of not guilty.

Now, Hernandez's attorneys are asking that some of that evidence obtained by officers be tossed out in court.

A cell phone turned over by Hernandez that shows he had been in contact with Lloyd, and made plans to hang out with him close to the time he died, was obtained by the prosecution under a 'false claim of legal authority' the defense is arguing.

 Prosecutors have alleged that Hernandez and Lloyd exchanged text messages arranging a meeting on the night that Hernandez and two accomplices picked up Lloyd in Boston before driving him to North Attleboro and killing him. 

According to CBS Boston, the defense claims they did not have the proper warrant to obtain the phone. 

Judge Susan Garsh said earlier today she would not yet rule on the motion to suppress the cell phone evidence.

The defense is also asking the judge for a change of venue, hoping to move the trial from Fall River, Massachusetts, to somewhere outside the Boston area.

Their reasoning includes a poll finding that most people in Bristol County already think their client is guilty of first-degree murder. 

Hernandez was again in court today and, just like yesterday, seen smiling and laughing. 

He is also facing murder charges in Suffolk County for the July 2012 drive-by shootings of two men outside a Boston club.
