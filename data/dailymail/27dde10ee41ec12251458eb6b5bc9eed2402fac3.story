Schools are struggling to cope with an influx of Roma children from Eastern Europe who arrive unable to speak English, Ofsted warned yesterday.

Inspectors said schools were hampered by a lack of resources to meet the ‘wide-ranging needs’ of new arrivals who may never have experienced formal education.

They said some pupils were unfamiliar with school routines and behaviour expectations. Many also needed intensive help to learn English but schools were struggling to find enough bilingual staff to teach them.

In some cases, Roma parents were unaware of what they were expected to do for their children and had to be taken food shopping by teachers to help them fill lunchboxes.

Ofsted warned that school budgets were being put under strain by the cost of extra provision.

At one school in Derby, the number of Roma pupils rose from four to 99 – almost a third of its roll – in three years.

The watchdog urged the Government to ensure that funding for schools was more responsive to fluctuations in the pupil population. However, inspectors found no negative effect on the achievement of other pupils.

The report follows visits to 11 schools in Manchester, Sheffield and Derby – where there have been large increases in the number of Roma pupils from Eastern Europe after border controls were relaxed.

Ofsted, led by chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw, called for more support for schools in areas with a large Roma population

In Sheffield, numbers rose from 100 to 2,100 in five years. Derby’s Roma pupil population tripled to 600 between 2009 and 2013. Manchester has an estimated 800 Roma pupils. Nationally, the number of gipsy and Roma pupils in schools has risen 14 per cent in a year to 19,000.

In a report entitled Overcoming Barriers, Ofsted said: ‘In the local authorities and schools visited, almost all Roma pupils arriving from Eastern Europe were new to speaking English.

‘Where newly-arrived Roma pupils have had little prior experience of formal education, schools and local authorities reported that initially they had difficulty in engaging the pupils to adhere to school routines and meet expectations for good behaviour.’

Inspectors said police were asked to address pupils and parents at one Derby primary after ‘a number of playground fights involving Roma pupils’.

‘They introduced a game to teach all children the rights and wrongs of behaviour,’ it added.

Even when Roma pupils were well integrated in schools and made good progress, their achievement in exams was still low due to their ‘exceptionally low starting points’.

The report went on to note that some schools felt obliged to meet the costs of lunches, uniforms and trips for Roma pupils despite not receiving funding to do so.

It told of one family who failed to send their children to school with money or food for lunch when they started. ‘Staff took the parent shopping to advise them on finding cheap and healthy options for packed lunches,’ said inspectors.

The report concluded that the schools and local authorities visited ‘were struggling to find the necessary resources to fully meet Roma pupils’ needs’.

A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘The difficult decisions we have taken elsewhere in Government have allowed us to protect the schools budget and ensure that local authorities and head teachers have the resources and flexibility to provide the support needed by their communities.’
