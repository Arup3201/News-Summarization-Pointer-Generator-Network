A three-year-old girl plunged 15 feet into an old septic tank full of freezing water - but was rescued by a carer who saw her fall in.

Alyson Machigua was playing with friends in a neighbour's back garden in Hackettstown, New Jersey, when she dropped into a hole leading to the disused tank.

Thankfully she was noticed by Luz Jimenez, who cares for the elderly owner of the house where the accident took place.

Rescued: Alyson Machigua, three, fell into the hole while playing with friends in a garden

Rescuer: Luz Jimenez, pictured, lowered herself into the hole with a cable to save Alyson

Danger: Pictured is the septic tank into which Alyson fell. She was pulled out shivering and crying but unharmed

Ms Jimenez heard Alyson screaming in the hole, and used a cable cord to lower herself into the tank and rescue the girl, who was shivering and crying but unharmed.

Police tried to stop Ms Jimenez from making the rescue, but she pressed on regardless. The pair were later helped out of the tank by emergency services using a ladder.

Rejoicing: Pictured is Alyson's mother, Marlen. Her family are hailing her rescue as a 'miracle from God'

After the rescue, Ms Jimenez only said: 'I didn't even think how far down it 
was... I just thought to try
 and help her. All I saw was water down there. I thought she was going 
to die in the water.'

Alyson's family are now celebrating the girl's 'miracle' survival. Her elder sister, Rosaura Murillo, told NBC New York: 'I was so happy and just having her in my arms, even though she was crying, that was the happiest thing for me.

'It's a miracle from God and we're very thankful for everybody who came out to help.'
