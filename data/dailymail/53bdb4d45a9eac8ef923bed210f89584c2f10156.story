In fact, supermarket giant ASDA have revealed that not only have they already sold their millionth Christmas jumper, sales are up a huge 160 per cent on this time last year.

Indeed, so popular are the jumpers, the supermarket revealed that some customers began their hunt for the perfect knit back in September.
