Charged: Paul Keene has been accused of the murder of Carmen Miron-Buchacra who was found dead in Bath on Sunday with their baby crying nearby

A father of one has been charged with the murder of his PhD student girlfriend at their Georgian home while their baby cried nearby.

Investment administrator Paul Keene, 31, is accused of killing 28-year-old Carmen Miron-Buchacra, known as Gaby, at their Georgian home in Bath, Somerset.

Keene appeared before Bath Magistrates Court today charged with the murder of the 'gifted' student in what is believed to be a domestic incident.

Emergency services found Ms Miron-Buchacra dead at the flat with the couple’s young baby crying nearby.

Keene
- who lives just yards from a row of renowned multimillion-pound 
apartments - was remanded in custody to appear before Bristol Crown 
Court on July 10.

Police were called to a disturbance at the couple's home just after midnight on Sunday.

They discovered Ms Miron-Buchacra's body at the attractive terraced property, which is split into five flats worth around £250,000 each.

The cause of death has not yet been released and post mortem investigations are continuing.

Ms Miron-Buchacra was
a fifth-year research student at the University of Bath, where she was 
studying for an Integrated PhD in Postgenomic Biosciences.

Dr Richard Hooley, Head of the Department of Biology and Biochemistry, where she studied, paid tribute to the 'outstanding' 28-year-old.

He said: 'All of us who had the privilege of working and studying with Gaby are going to miss her very much indeed.

'She was an outstanding and gifted research student and a lively, engaging and caring young woman.'

He added that her death had affected many colleagues and friends on campus.

A neighbour, who did not want to be named, said yesterday: 'The police told us that they had an 11-week-old baby.

'It’s so sad. So sad - especially with a baby involved. It’s just awful what can happen, just like that.'

The address is two doors down from the former home of Admiral Phillip, the first governor of Australia, who lived there between 1806 and 1814.

It lies opposite The Assembly Rooms, a magnificent 18th century building, which is now used as a museum and exclusive wedding venue.

The Circus, a world famous John Wood development and one of the UK’s most prestigious addresses, also lies just 150 yards away.

Revellers on their way home from a night out saw emergency services swarming around the five-storey terraced property.

One person, who did not wish to be named, said: 'We walked past the entrance at around 1am and there were a number of police cars and an ambulance but we didn’t think anything of it.

'When we went past the next day there were still a number of police officers around so we thought this must be serious.

'It is terribly tragic to hear that a woman has died and a man has been arrested.

'Bath is such a nice place and you rarely hear about this sort of thing.'

Local business owner David Price was shocked such a terrible incident could happen in one of the most affluent parts of the picturesque city.

He said: 'It’s a shame that something like that has happened.'

Mr Keene is listed as working as an administrator for Advance Investments Limited, in Bath, since 2007.

On its website, the company claims: 'Paul has become an integral part of the Advance support team.

'With over ten years' experience in different sectors of the Financial Services industry, Paul prides himself on delivering consistently excellent customer service, case management and adviser support with a clear focus on the customer experience.'

His company lists former London Irish, England and British Lions rugby star Mike Catt as a client.

In a testimonial on the website, he says: 'Advance take a professional and integrated view of my investment, pension and taxation affairs.

'I have complete faith in their integrity and ability to deliver a quality and value added service.'

Advance Investments Limited refused to comment on the arrest today.
