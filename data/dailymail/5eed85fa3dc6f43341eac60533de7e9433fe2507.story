Former first lady Barbara Bush announced on national television Thursday that she doesn't want her son, Jeb Bush, to run for president in 2016 because the country has 'had enough Bushes.'

'He’s by far the best qualified man, but no,' a blunt Mrs. Bush said when asked whether Jeb, the former governor of Florida, should run.

'I really don’t,' she continued. 'I think it’s a great country. There are a lot of great families, and it’s not just four families or whatever. There are other people out there that are very qualified. We’ve had enough Bushes.'

Mrs. Bush, 87, made the remarks in an interview on NBC's TODAY Show alongside her daughter-in-law, Laura Bush, 66, and twin granddaughters Jenna Bush Hager and Barbara Pierce Bush, both 31. 

The other Bush women reacted with nervous laughter as the eldest of the four went on, saying, 'I don't think he'll run. He'll get all our enemies and half our friends.'

Pausing, she turned to former first lady Laura Bush and added, 'And some of yours, too.'

Moments before, Laura Bush had offered a whole-hearted endorsement of her brother-in-law.

'He'd be terrific -  he would be a wonderful president,' she said of Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida. 

On Wednesday, George W. Bush had also weighed in and offered his support.

'He’d be a marvelous candidate if he chooses to do so,' he said in an interview with ABC News’ Diane Sawyer. 'He doesn’t need my counsel ’cause he knows what it is, which is "run." But whether he does or not, it’s a very personal decision.'

The Bush women and other members of the family are making the rounds in media interviews this week to prepare for the unveiling Thursday of a museum and library dedicated to the George W. Bush's presidency.

Asked how she feels about the memorials to her son's leadership, Barbara Bush said, 'this is maybe one of our happiest moments.'

Jenna Bush Hager said she feels proud of her dad and that she is reminded when she walks through the museum of what it was like growing up in the White House.

None of the women seemed to miss life in the White House, however.

'I don't miss one darn thing,' Barbara Bush said. 'Well, maybe the breakfast in bed, I guess.'

Laura Bush appeared to agree, saying only that she missed 'the chef.'

'It's dumb to miss something you cant have,' Barbara Bush added.

Asked about her husband's health, Barbara Bush assured that former President George H.W. Bush is 'great.'

'It's just the darn legs won't work, but other than that, he's perfect,' she said, smiling.
