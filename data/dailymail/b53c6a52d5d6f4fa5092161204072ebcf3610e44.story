This in the cruel Taiwanese college student who stuffed her cat into a jar as a 'punishment for misbehaving'.

Kiki Lin has now been charged with animal abuse after she posted a picture on to Facebook of her pet, also called Kiki, inside the glass container.

The cat is seen with its face pushed against the sides of the jar and is clearly upset by the experience.

And seeing the shocking image prompted Facebook users to criticise the English major's actions.

Many called Miss Lin an animal abuser, but she took to her account to say that the posters had 'too much time on their hands'.

Following the backlash the student, who attends Taichung's Providence University, told The China Post that she has put her pet in the jar to experiment with different ways of transporting it.

She claimed that she had only tried it once, but it didn't work because the trapped feline would not fit into a bag.

But when asked by the paper what she would say to those who had criticised her on Facebook she remained defiant.

She said: ' I only have three words for them, ha ha ha.'

However, it looks as though animal lovers will have the last laugh.

After conducting an investigation, the Taichung City Animal Protection and Health Inspection Office charged Miss Lin with animal protection law violations.

If found guilty she could face an expensive fine, and up to one year in prison.
