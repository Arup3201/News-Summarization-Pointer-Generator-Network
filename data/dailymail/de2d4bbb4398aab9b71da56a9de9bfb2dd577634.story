Chinese military forces have been mobilised in Chinese occupied Tibet 
after the fifth self-immolation in less than 48 hours was reported 
today.

Rumours of a sixth incident have yet to be confirmed as security has been tightened in Rebkong County in central China to prevent local people from joining a protest following incident number five.

The latest tragedies came after the first documented case of a triple self-immolation yesterday, where three teenage Tibetan monks set themselves alight as they called for the freedom of Tibet.

The monks set fire to themselves in Tibet as they begged for freedom from China

Several thousand people gathered in a
 peaceful protest after an 18-year-old man named Jinpa set fire to 
himself at around 5pm local time.

Jinpa hailed from the same area as Tamdin Tso, a 23-year-old woman who self-immolated yesterday.

The earlier triple self-immolation took place at approximately 3pm local time yesterday outside the gates of the local Public Security Bureau office in Gomang Township, Ngaba County, Eastern Tibet, which the Chinese refer to as Sichuan province.

Tamdin Tso died in the name of freedom

The boys called out for freedom in 
Tibet and for the return of the Dalai Lama as they set themselves on 
fire. Security forces arrived at the scene almost immediately.

The youngest monk, 15-year-old Dorjee, died at the scene.

His companions, 16-year-olds Samdup and Dorjee Kyab, were taken to hospital by security forces.

Their current whereabouts and wellbeing are unknown.

Tamdin Tso, who had a five year-old son, died at the scene after setting herself alight, near Rongwo in Rebkong County, Eastern Tibet.

Tamdin Tso took petrol from a motorbike and set fire to herself in the family's winter pasture.

Her body was taken back to her family’s home and local people gathered there to pray.   

Free Tibet Director Stephanie Brigden said: 'These are the youngest Tibetans to set fire to themselves in protest at China’ s occupation.

'This is also the largest single incident, yet another indication of the escalation of protests in Tibet.'

The five self-immolations follows reports from Rebkong, 
known as Tongren in Chinese, that people have been threatened with two 
years’ imprisonment for receiving or making international calls.

Chinese authorities are tightening their grip on the area in conjunction with the Communist 
party’s congress in Beijing.

International campaign organisation 
Free Tibet reported that in the days before the congress began, footage 
of security forces on training exercises has been broadcast across the 
Tibetan region.

It warned local people that Chinese security forces will be 
'ready to do whatever it takes to crush those who are destroying 
stability in the region to ensure that the 18th Party Congress is not 
disrupted’

Free Tibet Director Stephanie Brigden
 said there are grave concerns for the safety of the people of Rebkong 
County following the footage.

‘As Congress opens, China must be held accountable for its actions in Tibet,’ she said.

'These protests are aimed at sending the next generation of China’s unelected regime a clear signal that Tibetans will continue to fight for their freedom despite China’s efforts to suppress and intimidate them.
