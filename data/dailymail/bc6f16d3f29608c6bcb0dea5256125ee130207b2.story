Boxer Vido Loncar has been banned for life for viciously attacking a referee after losing his fight at the European Youth Boxing Championships in Croatia.

The referee, having given Loncar a standing count, stopped the fight but, as he was preparing to announce the result, was attacked by the 18 year old.

Incredibly, the Croatian boxing director defended his fighter's conduct.

'I believe that he is not a butcher or as bad as this act makes him look,' said Zeljko Mavrovic. 'This was part of his excessive ambition in that moment.'

Lithuanian Baniulis, who was awarded the victory, quickly fled the scene as spectators seemed stunned by the despicable attack.

Loncar’s coach failed to intervene as the attack ensued, before the Croatian was dragged from the ring by his feet by security guards.

Fortunately the Polish referee was then helped to his feet and received medical attention in hospital as Loncar was led away in shame. 

Lithuanian contender Algirdas Baniulis was winning the fight with consummate ease before it was stopped 

Loncar was evidently furious with the decision to stop the bout at the European Youth Championships 

The light-heavweight then proceeded to land a barrage of punches on the referee until security intervened
