The Philippines financial capital has banned disposable plastic shopping bags and Styrofoam food containers from today.

The move comes as part of escalating efforts across the nation's capital to curb rubbish blamed for deadly flooding.

Just hours after the ban was introduced, members of Makati City's Plastic Monitoring Task Force were out on the streets looking for vendors that were ignoring the new rules. 

A 25ft-high tidal wave of rubbish:   The Philippines financial capital banned disposable plastic shopping bags and styrofoam food containers as part of escalating efforts across the nation's capital to curb rubbish that exacerbates deadly flooding

Cause: Men play basketball near the dump site - the project officer of Makati's environmental services department, said cutting down on plastic was vital to stop the clogging of the city's waterways, which is widely blamed for contributing to floods

Food wrapped in plastic is still 
available, but Makati, one of 17 cities or districts that make up Metro 
Manila, has gone ahead with banning plastic bags.

Prexy Macana, project officer of Makati's environmental services department, told AFP that scaling back the use of plastic bags was essential to halt the clogging of the city's waterways, which is widely blamed for contributing to floods.

'During our bi-monthly wastewater clean-ups, we found most of the garbage is plastics,' she said.

Flooding is common in Manlia - last August the Philippine capital was brought to a near standstill by flooding after almost 24 hours of continuous rain - it left nine dead and scores homeless.

The previous year flash floods in the Philippines left a death toll of 1000.

Nature ruined: Fishermen sit on a rubbish-filled riverbank at a dump site in Manila. Consumers are now being given the option of paper alternatives or not using a bag at all

Making a living: A man arranges used plastic bottles on a truck to be sold at a shop in Manila

All change: A man uses a cloth bag while buying meat at a wet market in Manila's financial district, Makati City

Binned: Employees of a fast food store put the prohibited plastic cups into a trash bag at Manila's financial district

Watchful eye: Members of Makati City's Plastic Monitoring Task Force (PMTF), look for prohibited plastic used used by vendors at a wet market

The ban in 
Makati - the ninth out of the 17 areas to issue the plastics ban - means
 6.7 million of Metro Manila's population of 13 million people are 
covered by the restrictions, reported AFP.

The campaign to ban plastic bags is 
gathering momentum - in May 2003, South Africa set the pace by banning 
thinner plastic bags as well as imposing levies on thicker ones - Rwanda and Somalia have now banned bags completely.

China, South Africa, Kenya, Uganda and Bangladesh have all banned very thin plastic bags - the latter for the same reason as Manila.

All plastic bags except 
oxo-biodegradables are banned in the The
 United Arab Emirates after concerns about the risk to camels.

Last 
year Los Angeles became the biggest city in the United States to ban 
plastic bags from supermarket check-outs following bans in San Jose, San
 Francisco and Long Beach.

In
 2009, the United States International Trade Commission reported that 
102 billion plastic bags are used annually in the United States alone

Last month Britain's decision not to back a European law banning plastic bags caused friction with Italy and stunned environmental campaigners.

Italy's Environment Minister has criticised Britain's lack of support for the law, describing it as 'astounding' particularly for a seafaring nation.

Environmental campaigners have also been left flabbergasted by Britain's move earlier this month, especially given the Coalition government's support for reducing the environmental impact of bags on the landscape and wildlife.

Manila is prone to flooding, as seen in this 
photo taken last year so authorities are doing everything possible to 
clear drainage system - including banning plastic bags

The
 average EU citizen gets through about 500 plastic carrier bags a year –
 with most of them used once, according to Brussels. The total volume 
produced in Europe in 2008 was 3.4million tons, but only 6 per cent were
 recycled.

Despite 
their widespread use, research suggests most Europeans want to see a 
clampdown on carrier bags, with two thirds of people surveyed by the 
Commission saying they favoured an outright ban.

Last year, Italy became the first 
European country to ban non-biodegradable single-use plastic bags. 
Across the globe, Somalia, Rwanda and Tanzania have done the same.

In Britain, the first big high street chain to make customers pay for carrier bags was Marks & Spencer, in 2008.

The 5p charge led to a fall of 80 per cent in bag usage in the first few months.

The Republic of Ireland introduced a 12p levy on each bag in 2002, which led to a 95 per cent reduction in plastic bag litter.

Last October, Wales imposed a 5p charge. Shops that continue to provide free carrier bags face a fine of up to £5,000.

But
 some retailers, including Sainsbury’s and Boots, have resisted a bag 
charge, with Sainsbury’s saying that free plastic bags were ‘critical’ 
to its customers.
