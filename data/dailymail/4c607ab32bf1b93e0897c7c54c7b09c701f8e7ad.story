Female twin soccer players at the University of Mexico have dropped out of the school after one of the teens was hospitalized from drinking alcohol during a hazing incident.

Sisters Danielle and Devin Scelsi, from Trabuco Canyon, California, pulled out of the school following Sunday night's incident.

The University of New Mexico has canceled the first match of the women's soccer team's season this week after a hazing incident that left a teenager in hospital.

University officials said heavy drinking was involved but they rejected local media reports that Sunday night's incident involved players being made to strip, or even being sprayed with urine.

The OC Weekly reported that Danielle Scelsi called campus police to report her 18-year-old sister Devin was struggling to breathe and appeared to be vomiting after drinking. 

Officers found two other teens in the apartment with the teen sisters who also seemed drunk. Devin Scelsi was taken to a hospital and another 18-year-old was taken to a separate center. 

Two days after the incident, the sisters had left the school, the OC Weekly reported. 

Their mother Dawn Scelsi told KTLA her freshman daughters were brutally hazed by older members of the team. 

She said that they had been playing soccer since the age of four and that was all they wanted to do. They were now focused on their future education, the mom added. 

Two students have left UNM as a result of the initiations, the team's coach confirmed on Wednesday. The school said the UNM athletics department had let down its players. 

'We failed the young women of our soccer program who did not understand the seriousness of hazing,' UNM athletic director Paul Krebs told a news conference in Albuquerque.

'These are good women, but they damaged the reputation of the university, the women's soccer program, and themselves.' 

Krebs said an ongoing probe has revealed that the majority of the team's players were consuming alcohol at more than one off-campus location, but that none of them were forced to drink.

A report by UNM campus police said officers responding to a 911 call took one 18-year-old player to hospital who was extremely intoxicated and had trouble breathing.

A second intoxicated 18-year-old, who was having trouble standing, was not transported, police said. 

Krebs said that while the investigation continues, Friday's season opener against Texas Tech in the Mountain West Conference has been canceled, resulting in a $5,000 fine for UNM.

'We are also assessing what our coaches did and didn't know (about the incident),' Krebs told reporters.

Kit Vela, the soccer team's coach, sat alongside him and appeared visibly distressed.

'As a mother, I am upset and angered over what happened,' she said, adding that the teenager who went to hospital was released on Monday. 

Vela said the player and her sister, who was also on the team, have since left the university.

A soccer match scheduled between UNM and Texas Tech this Friday has been canceled resulting in a $5,000 fine for the New Mexico school. The team is pictured in a huddle in 2013 (there is no indication that any player pictured was involved in the hazing incident)
