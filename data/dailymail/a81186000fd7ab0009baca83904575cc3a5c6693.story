Kim Jong II's son was today reportedly in control of one of North Korea's highest decision-making bodies as he prepared to take power.

Nine days after the death of his father,  Kim Jong Un was named head of the key ruling Workers' Party Central Committee by the state newspaper Rodong Sinmun.

Over the weekend he was hailed as the 'Supreme Leader' of the 1.2-million strong military and will be the third-generation Kim to rule the nation of 24 million.

Leader in waiting: Kim Jong Il's heir Kim Jong Un visits Kumsusan Memorial Palace in Pyongyang, to pay respects to his father

As the country continued official mourning until the funeral on Wednesday, two leading South Koreans have crossed the border to pay their respects to the dead dictator.

Former South Korean First Lady Lee Hee-ho and Hyundai firm head Mrs Hyun Jung-Eun will spend two days in the country.

South Korea has only allowed the two delegations to visit and pay condolences angering Pyongyang, which 
has since warned of 'catastrophic consequences' for relations between the warring neighbours.

But the two women have been given special 
permission to pay their respects in person, because both families have 
received personal condolences from the North in the past, according to 
the BBC.

She said: 'I hope that our visit will help improve South-North relations.'

Dictator: North Korean leader Kim Jong II who died on December 17

Kim Jong Il's youngest son is in his late 20s and was unveiled 15 months ago as his father's choice as successor.

Even as North Koreans braved icy weather to visit 'mourning stations' set up around the country, the state media were providing details about Kim Jong Un's rise to power.

Koreans should become 'eternal revolutionary comrades' with him, 'the sun of the 21st century,' Rodong Sinmun said yesterday.

State television also showedÂ  footage showing his uncle and key patron, Jang Song Thaek, wearing a military uniform with a general's insignia.

He is normally dressed in a business suit and this is seen as the strongest indication he will play a crucial role in helping the young man hold a grip on power and inherit his father's trademark 'military-first' policy.

Jang, a vice chairman of the powerful
National Defense Commission, is the husband of Kim Kyong Hui, younger 
sister of Kim Jong Il and a key Workers' Party official.

South Korean lawmakers say 
intelligence officials have predicted that Jang and his wife will play 
larger roles supporting Kim Jong Un.

The North's state TV repeatedly showed footage yesterday of wailing uniformed soldiers, many with shaved heads, and other citizens professing their tear-choked longing for Kim Jong II.
