With Manchester United wallpaper on the walls and an Alvin and the Chipmunks DVD on the chest of drawers, it looks like a typical 10 year-old boy's bedroom.

But these images show the moment police in riot helmets carried out a dawn raid, sweeping into his room and arresting him on suspicion of burglary.

He is believed to be one of the youngest targets of a dawn raid and was held along with his 37-year-old father as part of a crackdown on gangs in Coventry.

Child: Police in Coventry have arrested a burglary suspect aged just ten in a dawn raid. Footage shows officers searching his drawers next to a pack of biscuits, a games console and an Alvin and the Chipmunks DVD

Dawn raid: Police swept into the house belonging to an alleged crime family just after 6am yesterday

Arrest: A heavily tattooed man was shown being arrested. The boy and his father, 37, were both held as burglary suspects. One alleged raid took £400,000 of Apple gadgets from a warehouse in Leicester

Computer equipment, phones, clothing and a substance were seized by police from the property in Wood End, Coventry. 

The pair were questioned in connection with a house burglary on September 9 in Lapworth Road, which is in their neighbourhood, and bailed yesterday pending further enquiries.

Detective Inspector Nick Dale, speaking outside the house, said: 'We believe this family are responsible
for considerable crime and disorder within this community, and members 
of the community are intimidated by their activities.

'We're
here to send a message that this is not acceptable. It's not acceptable
that people are intimidated within their own neighbourhoods and we will
take action.

'It 
must be incredibly frustrating for hard-working, law-abiding members of 
the community to see people who have no legitimate income living 
apparently beyond their means.

'They
might be able to afford a nice car or expensive clothes and there will 
be question marks over how they have afforded that lifestyle.'

The father and son were arrested as part of an 'intensive assault' on gangs who allegedly raided 'numerous' shops and pubs in Coventry.

Detective Inspector Nick Dale said: 'It must be incredibly frustrating for hard-working, law-abiding members of the community to see people who have no legitimate income living apparently beyond their means'

DVDs found in the house included the violent comic book-style film Sin City. Several items were seized by police

A gang also stole £400,000 worth of Apple iPads, iPods and iPhones from an electronics warehouse in Leicester.

West Midlands Police seized computer equipment, phones, clothing and 'a substance' from the home during yesterday's joint raid just after 6am, a spokesman said.

The video released by the force shows officers in blue riot helmets using a battering ram to smash through the front door, which had been reinforced.

A heavily-tattooed man with his tracksuit top half-open, believed to be the boy's father, is seen being put in handcuffs.

And officers are pictured searching through clothes in the boy's bedroom drawers next to a half-eaten packet of biscuits, a games console and several DVDs.

Officers questioned the youngster on suspicion of being involved in a burglary of a nearby house on September 9.

His father was quizzed on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary.

Officers in blue riot helmets burst through the door within seconds and arrested the 10-year-old just after 6am

The boy was only just old enough to be arrested, as in England and Wales children only reach the age of criminal responsibility when they turn ten.

Before that they cannot be arrested or charged with a crime, even for violent or sexual offences.

Yesterday's operation came two weeks after a number of other dawn raids on nearby homes.

Detective Inspector Dale said: 'We want the community to sit up and take notice of our efforts to tackle organised crime. Law-abiding citizens can rest assured we’re taking strong action against suspects, whilst criminals should be asking themselves: "am I next?"

'We’ve embarked on an intensive 
assault on Coventry’s crime gangs. These are individuals who seem to 
think they’re above the law, are involved in anti-social behaviour and 
who often "rule" their communities through intimidation. No-one should 
feel threatened or worried in their own community.

'We’re
determined to cut the criminal cancer from our communities and would 
urge members of the public to back our efforts by reporting any concerns
or suspicions they have to us.

'We would like to encourage people to 
come forward with information about activities whether it be crime or 
disorder and that information will be taken seriously and will be 
investigated.

'One of our 
jobs in an investigation like this is to establish whether the lifestyle
of the person has been funded through crime and if it has, then we will
be seizing the property that has been obtained as a result.

Anyone with information which could help should call police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
