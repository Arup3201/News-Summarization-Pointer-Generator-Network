When Amber Carter went for an eye test, her biggest fear was that she’d have to wear glasses.

Instead, the 23-year-old was told she might have a brain tumour.

She was rushed to hospital where scans confirmed the diagnosis, and the next day had a nine-hour operation to remove a growth that was so big it ‘freaked her out’.

Miss Carter, an assistant manager at a
perfume shop, said: ‘I was having really bad headaches and sickness 
last summer and my right arm started to get weak.

‘I was in so much pain and feeling really tired all the time and some days I couldn’t get out of bed.

‘I’d been to the doctor several times 
but nothing was getting  done so I changed my GP and  the new one 
suggested I went for an eye test.

‘At that time my biggest concern was 
that I might have to wear glasses but in the end it saved my life. The 
optometrist noticed that both my optic nerves were swollen and rang the 
hospital in Bath for an appointment within two hours and everything 
happened so fast from then.’

Miss Carter, from Chippenham, 
Wiltshire, was given CAT and MRI scans which revealed she had a tumour 
on the right side of her brain. Afterwards she was taken by ambulance to
the specialist centre at Bristol’s Frenchay Hospital.

She said: ‘I didn’t really know what was going on at that stage, but everyone was fussing over me.

‘I had a second MRI scan in  Bristol and that confirmed the tumour and I was admitted for  surgery the next day.

‘When the surgeon brought my scan 
picture up it was under his arm but I could see how big it  was and it 
freaked me out. They compared it to the size of a small orange, about 
5cm [2in] across.

‘I really thought that was it  for me then.’

She added: ‘They actually shaved part of my brain away because the tumour had grown so big.’

Miss Carter woke from the operation, 
last October, with no feeling on her right side. But, mercifully, she 
was told the tumour was benign and that all traces of it had been 
removed. She needs physiotherapy three times a week and has yet to 
regain the full use of the right side of her body.

But she can now walk unaided  for short distances and hopes to return to work in a couple of months’ time.

Miss Carter said: ‘They don’t know if 
I’ll get all the sensation back, but I’d rather have this weakness and 
know they got it all out.

‘I’m so grateful to the optician. If I hadn’t made that appointment I probably wouldn’t be here today.’

Optometrist Anna Lewin, 33, of Haine 
& Smith in Chippenham, said: ‘I could see that her optic nerves were
swollen in both eyes and that can indicate the presence of a tumour.

‘She needed to be checked immediately at hospital and I rang them myself and got her in.

‘She was completely shocked to find 
she’d got a brain tumour –  her biggest fear when she arrived was that 
she might have to  wear glasses.

‘I would always urge anyone suffering similar symptoms to have an eye test as a precaution.’
