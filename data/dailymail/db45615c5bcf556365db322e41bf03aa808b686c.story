'Under the couch': Neighbors told how they thought the boy, three, had found the weapon he used to kill his mother

Her body was found by her mother-in-law, who lives with the family. Police said that the three-year-old tried to leave the home after the killing.

Neighbors told the local KRJH TV station that the child had found the handgun under the couch in the home. They also said they thought Engles was in the Army.

Her husband, Brian, a truck driver, was out of the state when the shooting took place but returned that evening.

In a social media post after her death was confirmed he said: 'I lost my wife to an accident yesterday. 

'Don't forget to tell your loved ones they are loved. You really never know when the last "I love you" really is the last.'

In a previous post on Facebook, he seemed to indicate support for gun ownership and arming people more widely.

Three days after the Sandy Hook school massacre in December 2012, he linked to a news story about an Oklahoma congressman proposing that teachers carry weapons in class, saying: 'A glimmer of hope peeks through the shroud.'

Members of the family, including the grandmother and the children, were seen outside the home last night comforting one another. 

Dave Walker, a sergeant in Tulsa Police's homicide division, said: 'There's several guns in the house, it's going to be a large-caliber handgun.'

A Tulsa police spokesman said: 'The investigation revealed that the three year old accidentally shot his mother. The victim was transported to St. John and was pronounced dead at 5:38pm.

'The husband/father was notified of the tragedy and returned home. The three-year-old was interviewed by child specialists and confirmed what the evidence led investigators to assume.

'The neighbors, family, coworkers, and church family quickly gathered around this family in support of them during this terrible time.'
