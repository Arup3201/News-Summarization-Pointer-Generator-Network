London is now ‘a country of its own’ with property prices in a different league to the rest of the nation after home values in the capital rose by nearly 30 per cent last year.

Property prices surged by 29.5 per cent to an average of £473,500 in the 12 months to the end of March, according to estate agency chain Haart.

It means that a typical house or flat in the capital has risen by nearly £108,000 in just one year, compared with an average London salary of £36,000.

West London, including upmarket areas such as Notting Hill and Kensington, is the biggest hotspot, with prices surging by nearly 63 per cent annually and by nearly 6 per cent alone in February.

Prices in the capital are rising at a much higher rate than in the provinces due to an influx of wealthy overseas buyers, who see prime London property as a safe haven for their money.

The number of new buyers in London was up by a third and the number of first time purchasers rose by just under 44 per cent annually, despite the financial difficulties for many young people of getting a foot on the ladder.

‘London is now a country of its own in property market terms,’ said Paul Smith, the chief executive of Haart.

‘Foreign investment continues to flood in – people know there is no more lucrative place in the world to invest your money and see outstanding returns.’

‘Growth is spreading like glue across the country, too,’ he added.

Home values nationwide rose by 7.4 per cent to £195,511, but by 9.8 per cent for first time buyers to £159,749, according the Haart figures, drawn from reports from more than 100 agencies across the country.

The heady increases are being driven by an imbalance of supply and demand.

The number of new properties for sale went up by just 1.8 per cent over the year, but that was heavily outstripped by a 24.5 per cent increase in the number of new buyers.

‘Open house weekends are now commonplace,‘ said Smith. ‘We hold around 240 every weekend.’

The latest housing market statistics from Haart, the UK’s largest independent network of estate agents, come hard on the heels of data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) last week showing house price inflation of 17.7 per cent in London and 9.7 per cent across England as a whole.

In parts of the country, however, growth is still much slower.

The ONS found Scotland clocked up an increase of just 2.4 per cent, Northern Ireland registered 2.8 per cent and there was a rise of just 2.9 per cent in the Northeast.

Government measures to assist first-time buyers, such as the Help to Buy scheme, which offers subsidies on property purchases up to £600,000, have been blamed for creating the risk of a new housing bubble.

Dr Howard Archer, the chief European and UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said that talk of a bubble in London is ‘already fully justified’ and added that concerns are being stoked about a general bubble across the country as price rises become more widespread.

The International Monetary Fund earlier this month urged the Bank of England to be vigilant over rapidly rising house prices.

Jose Vinals, the fund’s head of financial stability, said that the Bank’s Financial Policy Committee needs to make a judgment ‘at some stage’ to intervene to cool down the housing market.
