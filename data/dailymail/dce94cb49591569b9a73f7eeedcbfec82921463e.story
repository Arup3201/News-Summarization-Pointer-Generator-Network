Serial killer Joseph Paul Franklin was granted a stay of execution Tuesday only hours before he was set to die of lethal injection in a Missouri jail.

Mr Franklin, 63, and his legal team were able to successfully argue the state was at risk of violating the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment by using pentobarbital as an execution drug.

The drug is slowly starting to replace previously used lethal injection cocktails because drug manufacturers will no longer provide them to US prisons.

The Neo-Nazi who claims he tried to start a race war in the late 1970s was scheduled to die at 12.01am Wednesday morning will instead likely be sleeping inside his cell only days after confessing to killing 17 more people than previously confirmed.

The state had originally planned to use propofol, the same drug that killed Michael Jackson from an overdose, but recent shortages forced officials to find an alternative.

A judge ruled Tuesday afternoon that a lawsuit filed on behalf of Mr Franklin and 20 other Missouri inmates on death row contending arguing the dangers of propofol must be resolved before anyone can be executed.

Lawyers for the serial killer have argued the drug can cause contamination and pain above and beyond thresholds allowed by the Eight Amendment - which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.

The judge agreed, writing that the state 'has not provided any information about the certification, inspection history, infraction history, or other aspects of the compounding pharmacy or of the person compounding the drug.'

A separate ruling from another judge called Mr Franklin's mental capacity into question, and said his mental illness should be reviewed before he is put to death.

His mental state is such that he wasn't even aware he was on death row.

'He was happy,' his attorney told the St Louis Tribune. 'I’m not really convinced that he totally understands that he was going to die.'

The state appealed the appeals court ruling as it relates to the use of pentobarbital, reported the Tribune. It is not clear if the ruling regarding Mr Franklin's mental state will also be appealed.

Mentally detached: Mr Franklin's lawyer says he was likely unaware he was on death row

Mr Franklin earlier this week confirmed to CNN he was responsible for 
the cold-blooded execution-style deaths of 'approximately' 22 people.

He was devoid of emotion as he attempted to justify his killings -
which famously included an attempt on the life of Hustler porn supremo 
Larry Flynt - who incredibly tried to stop his shooters execution.

Following his 1980 arrest, Mr Franklin told detectives that he selected the St Louis synagogue from the Yellow Pages of the telephone directory because he wanted to 'find a Jew and kill him,' according to reports.

The white supremacist was also convicted in the 1977 killing of an interracial couple in Madison, Wisconsin, as well as in the 1980 shooting deaths of two black joggers in Salt Lake City.

Mr Franklin's other convictions include the murders of a two teenage black boys and the bombing a synagogue in Chattanooga, Tennessee in 1977.

'I felt like I was at war. The survival of the white race was at stake,' he told Kyung Lah of CNN in an interview that was to be his last before being executed.

'I consider it my mission, my three-year mission. Same length of time Jesus was on his mission, from the time he was 30 to 33.'

Death row: Joseph Paul Franklin is scheduled to 
die by lethal injection at 12.01am on Wednesday for the sniper killing 
of 42-year-old Gerald Gordon outside a suburban St. Louis synagogue in 
1977

Investigators believe his cross-country crime spree was fueled by a hatred of blacks and Jews.

Mr Franklin confessed collared in 1980 after the Salt Lake City killings.

Among his alleged crimes were two high-profile shootings — of civil rights leader Vernon Jordan in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 1980, and the man he calls his 'old pal' - porn mogul Larry Flynt, in Lawrenceville, Georgia, in 1978.

Both men survived.

Mr Franklin told CNN he believed he was going to start a race war and that his preferred method to kill his victims was to stalk them and set up a sniper's nest from which he pick them off using a high-powered rifle.

Seemingly still in denial, Mr Franklin tried to blame his rough childhood on his three-year orgy of violence.

'My momma didn't care about us,' he said, as he complained he wasn't fed properly and not allowed to play with other children.

Finding another family in the white supremacist groups in the American South in the 1960s, Mr Franklin felt he found his calling after reading Adolf Hitler's political manifesto 'Mein Kampf'.

'I've never felt that way about any other book that I read,' he said, 'it was something weird about that book.'

At 26, he changed his name to Joseph Paul Franklin to honor Nazi propaganda minister Paul Joseph Goebbels and founding father Benjamin Franklin.

He even attempted to link himself to infamous serial killer Charles Manson by having the words 'Helter Skelter' tattooed on his arm in reference to |Mr Manson's inspiration provided by The Beatles 'White Album'.

The tattoo artist rebuffed the attempt, the tattoo never came.

Mr Franklin explained that he hoped his early murders would set an example to other would-be soldiers in his one-man war on minorities.

in Madison, Wisconsin in 1977, two black joggers in Salt Lake City in 
1980 and bombing a synagogue in Chattanooga, Tennessee in 1977

'I figured once I started doing it and showed them how, other white supremacists would do the same thing.'

Mr Franklin then shockingly claimed minorities he once targeted now have a kinship with him.

'When you commit a crime against a certain group of people, a bonding takes place. It seems like you belong to them,' he said.

In addition to the murder of Mr Gordon outside a bar mitzvah, Mr Franklin was convicted of killing Alphonse Manning and Toni Schwean in Madison, Wisconsin, because they were an interracial couple.

He also confessed to shooting dead college student Rebecca Bergstrom, after she told him in passing that she dated a Jamaican man.

His most shocking murder was that of 13-year-old Dante Evans and his cousin 14-year-old Darrell Lane in Cincinnati -  two African Americans jogging with white female friends.

Joseph Deters, who prosecuted that Cincinnati case said, 'He's just a creep. There's no other way to describe him. And what he did to those two kids because of the color of their skin is incomprehensible.'

Victim: Larry Flynt says he doesn't to see the man who shot him put to death

Hustler chief Flynt was standing trial on an obscenity charge in Georgia in 1978 when he was wounded by a sniper's bullet. No one was arrested at the time, but the shooting has since been linked to Mr Franklin.

Gwinnett County, Ga., District Attorney Danny Porter said he is convinced Franklin shot Flynt because Franklin provided information only the shooter would know — details about the shooting location, the type of weapon used, even the maker of the gun.

The details were divulged while the killer served time in the 1990s in a Georgia prison.

Mr Franklin said he shot the pornographer because of a magazine front cover showing an interracial couple.

'I saw that interracial couple he had, photographed there, having sex,' he told CNN, referring to the December 1975 issue of Hustler

'It just made me sick. I think whites marry with whites, blacks with blacks, Indians with Indians. Orientals with orientals. I threw the magazine down and thought, I'm gonna kill that guy.'

However, Mr Porter said he opted against filing charges because Franklin had already been convicted of multiple killings and said it didn't make sense to bring him back to Georgia to face trial for shooting Mr Flynt.

Incredibly, the Hustler founder has become an unlikely supporter of Franklin's - in so much as he doesn't want him to face the death penalty.

Mr Flynt would rather his shooter rot away in a prison cell.

'The government has no business at all being in the business of killing people,' said Flynt.

'(It's) much more punishment to put somebody in prison for the rest of their lives than it is to snip their life out in a few seconds with a lethal injection.'

Mr Flynt's sadistic hopes have been kept alive for the time being.
