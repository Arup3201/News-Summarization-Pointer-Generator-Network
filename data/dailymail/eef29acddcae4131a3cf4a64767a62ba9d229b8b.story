Manchester United youngster Tom Lawrence is the subject of a bid from Premier League new-boys Leicester City.

The 20-year-old was given his full league debut at the end of last season by Ryan Giggs when he started alongside James Wilson against Hull City.

However he has not featured for United this season under Loius van Gaal and is looking at a move to the King Power Stadium.

The Welsh forward has previously had loan spells at Carlisle and Yeovil - but a move to Leicester would give him the chance to play in the Premier League.

The Foxes are also eyeing up a move for Lawrence’s fellow United young gun Nick Powell - although any deal for him would be a temporary switch.

Powell, 20, has made just two league appearances and scored one goal since switching to Old Trafford and doesn't appear to feature in Louis van Gaal's plans for Manchester United's recovery this season.
