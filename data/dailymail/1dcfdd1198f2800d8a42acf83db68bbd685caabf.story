Shadow childcare minister Lucy Powell said part-time staff are treated as lower status employees, despite often working harder

Working mothers on part-time hours can be better employees because they do not waste time in the office browsing Facebook or nursing a hangover, a Labour frontbencher has claimed.

Shadow childcare minister Lucy Powell called for a change in office culture which means part-timers are viewed as lower 'status' employees.

Far from being less productive, those working three or four days a week are often squeezing the work of a full-time employee into fewer hours, she added.

It comes as a new survey shows fewer than one in seven employees in top jobs work part-time.

Unions claim most of the country's best-paid jobs are 'no-go' areas for people not willing to work full-time hours.

Official figures show that women working part-time or taking time off to have children means their pay stops rising a decade earlier than men.

A recent government survey found small firms in particular did not recognise the wider benefits of flexible working to the business.

But Miss Powell, who gave birth to son Tom in May last year, said she wanted 'champion working mums’.

She told MailOnline: ‘Part-timers and people who are on flexible working contracts often aren’t given the same status in the workplace.

‘We need to put these issues centre stage because they are incredibly important.

'They are issues of fundamental inequality. We need to show companies and champion more women who successfully are able to manage a career whilst either working part-time or doing that while having children.

‘So we can debunk the myths that we are less productive and less successful because we might work three or four days a week as opposed to working full-time.

‘Some savvy businesses very often find that people working flexibly are more productive because they tend to use their time more effectively.’

Working mothers are used to juggling multiple demands at home and bring those skills to the office, she added.

‘We are not sitting on Facebook or coming in with a hangover. When we are working we are on it – and making the most of every minute of every day because when you are at home with family you have got to be on it every minute as well.’

Working mothers are better at juggling the demands of life in the office, because they also have to be 'on it' at home, Miss Powell said

She said employers had to recognise that supporting working mothers was ’good for business’.

‘It is about retaining a talented and loyal workforce,’ she said.

Research by the TUC showed that two-thirds of the 900,000 employees in the highest paid occupations, such as financial managers and medical practitioners, are male.

Just 6 per cent of chief executives and senior company officials - who earn more than £43-an-hour - work part-time and only one in four is female.

However the lowest-paid jobs, like cleaners and working in shops, are dominated by women and part-time work.

TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'Young women are more than able to match their male colleagues as they start out in their careers.

'But too much of their talent and experience goes to waste as soon as they have children and seek greater flexibility in their working hours.

'Employers' blinkered refusal to allow senior staff to work part-time and flexibly means that many top-paying occupations are complete "no-go" areas for staff wanting to work shorter hours. Instead, millions of women are forced into low-paying sectors.'

Women earn most before they turn 40, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Their pay peaks in the 30-39 age group at £533-a-week or £27,726-a-year.

However, men continue to see another 10 years of wage rises, peaking in the 40-49 age group at £638-a-week or £33,176.

Men see their average weekly earnings rise until they turn 50 but women's pay peaks before they turn 40, according to the ONS

The ONS said: ‘This is likely to be 
connected with the fact that many women have children and the time taken
 out of the labour market, combined with career choices they make 
subsequent to this, may impact on their earnings thereafter.’

Labour has promised to extend free childcare for three and four year olds with working parents from 15 to 25 hours.

It would also guarantee childcare before and after school for primary school age children.

Meanwhile the coalition is offering free childcare for two-year-olds from the poorest households, and will give a tax break worth £1,200 off the cost of childcare.
