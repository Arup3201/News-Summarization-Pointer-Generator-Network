The UK’s largest supermarkets are charging customers up to 40 per cent more to purchase shopping in their convenience stores.

An analysis of prices revealed that Sainsbury’s, Waitrose and Tesco are putting significant premiums on the products sold in their smaller outlets.

A sample basket at a Sainsbury’s Local cost 10.2 per cent more than at a larger store several hundred yards away.

Shoppers said they were reluctant to buy lunch on-the-go or ingredients for dinner that day because at convenience stores because of their prices

A survey of 20,000 UK shoppers showed that although people buy from convenience stores and like that they are handy, they don't think their prices are fair

And the same goods at Waitrose were 7.8 per cent more expensive at one of their downsized branches.

However Tesco had the biggest 
differences in pricing between its ‘Express’ convenience stores and 
larger supermarkets – with a difference of 11.2 per cent.

A single orange at a Tesco Express shop cost 40 per cent more than at a superstore.

A British Retail Consortium spokesman 
said: ‘Where prices vary, it is due to the different overheads involved 
in running different types of store.’

Retail consultancy Him! surveyed consumers about their grocery shops and convenience culture.

Results revealed that UK shoppers are
 increasingly doing 'top up' shops in supermarkets rather than 
convenience shops, so that they can buy cheaper products.

Of the 20,000 shoppers surveyed, 40 per cent said they don't think that the prices in convenience stores are fair.

Katie Littler, insights director of 
Him! told trade magazine The Grocer that the industry has to address how
 shoppers feel about the disparity in prices between their branches.

'There are no excuses because shoppers don’t care about a store owner’s increased costs,' she said.

'Shoppers
 are increasingly expecting prices in convenience to match supermarkets,
 meaning they will be tougher judges of convenience stores.

'A
 poor price perception continues to be the main barrier to UK adults 
using convenience stores -limiting footfall, visit frequency and spend.'

Shoppers said the price disparity was the main reason they are put-off buying lunch on-the-go or getting ingredients for meals-for-tonight.

Him!’s Convenience Tracking Programme 2013 shows that although the amount spent per trip increased from 
£5.63 in 2012 to £6.04 in 2013, basket size remained at 2.8 items and 
visit frequency fell from 3.7 to 3.6 times a week.

Special offers and bulk reductions that are available in large stores, are not always offered in the chain's smaller shope

Supermarket owners argue that the increased cost of rent and overheads in high street convenience stores is behind some of their price differences

An increase in top-up shopping 
fuelled a surge of almost ten per cent in the number of convenience 
stores owned by supermarkets last year.

According to the survey, shoppers who use convenience stores know they charge more but do not think it is 
fair.

Although 71 per cent of those surveyed said they were happy to pay a
 little bit more for convenience, 40 per cent said they did not think 
convenience stores charged fair and reasonable prices.

Trade magazine The Grocer said that supermarkets 
make no secret of the fact that they charge more for products in their 
convenience stores.

The Grocer said Tesco and Sainsbury’s typically charge a few pence more but claim 
it is difficult to give a like-for-like percentage comparison because 
product sizes and promotions are different.

Morrisons ‘M’ local also 
charges more but claims it is less than rivals because of its unique 
supply chain.

The premium at Waitrose is around 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent.

In addition the percentage of people who expected a £1 product in a convenience store to also cost £1 in a supermarket rose from 21 per cent in 2012 to 30 per cent in 2013.

Research showed that shoppers find the most 
‘over-priced’ categories were household, fresh meat and fish, health and
 beauty, fruit and veg, and tinned and packet grocery.
