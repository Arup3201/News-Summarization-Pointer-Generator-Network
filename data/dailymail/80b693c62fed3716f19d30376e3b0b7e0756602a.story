In addition to providing light, some curiously designed lamp posts on a bridge in China may actually prompt some people to light up - because the poles look just like massive cigarettes.

Painted white at the top and yellow at their base, the posts form part of 'cigarette bridge' on the Qili River in Zhengzhou, Henan Province.

After pictures of the bridge began to circulate on the Chinese micro-blogging site Sina Weibo, some users started to speculate that the designer was a heavy smoker.

It's possible that the designer of the poles was attempting to honour local industry. 

As well as producing cement, tractors, refrigerators and chemical fibre, Henan Province also manufactured more than a billion cigarettes in 2005, according to China.org.  

The cigarette-shaped street lights are just one example of Chinese architecture gone wrong, or at the very least, gone weird. 

There are so many strange buildings in China that President Xi Jinping called for an end to 'weird architecture' during a  speech at a literary symposium in Beijing in October.

He added that new construction should 'be like sunshine from the blue sky and the breeze in spring that will inspire minds, warm hearts, cultivate taste and clean up undesirable work styles'.

A survey by an architectural firm found that many people ranked the Pangu Plaza Hotel in Beijing as one of the ugliest buildings in China. The building was used during the 2008 Beijing Olympics.  

Beijing's vice mayor Chen Gang announced in December that the historical city will begin to start regulating building aesthetics. 

New construction in the city will have to match urban design standards specifying size, style, colour and materials.  

A museum in the Kangbashi district of the city of Ordos in Inner Mongolia doesn't look like a cigarette, but it could pass for an ash tray
