Ahead of kick-off at Old Trafford, Liverpool tweeted a picture of Steven Gerrard’s shirt hanging up in the visitors’ dressing room.

After another defeat in the Barclays Premier League - their seventh of the season - the Liverpool captain could not get out of this place quick enough.

Last March, when the club were challenging for the title, he scored twice in a 3-0 victory here at Old Trafford to maintain the momentum.

On Sunday he looked up to the heavens at the final whistle and appeared to be pleading for help. Is this really happening? Afraid so, Stevie.

Brendan Rodgers will tell you that his team dominated possession and should have got something out of Liverpool’s biggest game of the season. The body language of the players will tell you differently.

This is a dysfunctional mob, a group of players slung together over the summer and asked to repeat last season’s extraordinary feats.

There is no chance of that now, not after the manner and the conviction of this defeat by their oldest rivals in English football.

Who knows what Liverpool are aiming for now and it will only be magnified when the draw for the last 32 of the Europa League takes places again. They have the feel of a category B club again. 

This Liverpool dressing room is split, divided in their approach after failing to finish second behind Real Madrid in their Champions League group. ‘I wouldn’t tell if there have been issues, we keep that sort of thing internal,’ claimed Rodgers. It feels like it is out in the open anyhow.

Liverpool’s defence was all over the place at times here, cowed into a corner by the brilliance of Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and the extremely fortunate Juan Mata.

Here at Old Trafford we perhaps witnessed a Liverpool team look disaffected and done in for the first time in living memory.

The decision to play Brad Jones ahead of Simon Mignolet - admittedly no great shakes this season - clearly disrupted the Liverpool defence. So did the switch to 3-4-3, without a main striker and a load of work on the training ground in the days leading up to the game. It was a mistake.

Liverpool’s confidence is shot, summed up by the decision-making and their failure to show any sign of cohesion or spirit out there.

At 20, Raheem Sterling believes he has earned a contract on a par with the big boys after a decent finish to last season that ended with a place in the England squad.

Talented boy he is, but he was denied three times here by Manchester United’s brilliant keeper David de Gea. On each occasion, you backed de Gea.

Brad Jones, brought in to replace Simon Mignolet in goal, was wrong-footed when Rooney put United in to an early lead. He never recovered.

Neither did Gerrard, the man caught out of position when he was dragged to the ball by the sight of Antonio Valencia bounding down the right wing.

Rooney, his opposite number for the day in the boiler room, swept in United’s first. After that there was no way back for Liverpool.

What has happened to Gerrard? He is a tormented soul again, wishing away the season after Rodgers confirmed again that his team is in transition.

Even at the start of the second half, when you normally expect Gerrard to be showing some emotion and stirring his team-mates before kick-off, he was quiet and subdued.

Then there was Mario Balotelli, brought on at the start of the second half to replace Adam Lallana. He could have had a hat-trick.

He was denied, just like Sterling, by the brilliance of de Gea in United’s goal. Beating the Spaniard from close range is a formidable task these days.

After this it is all about saving Liverpool’s season and Rodgers must come up with some more answers this week.

The trip to Dean Court on Wednesday for a Capital One Cup tie against Championship leaders Bournemouth is full of pitfalls. Eddie Howe’s team scored five against Cardiff and will fancy their chances of another scalp against Liverpool.

After that it is on to Arsenal, the team they beat 5-1 at Anfield last season. This time, it feels like they are hanging on.
