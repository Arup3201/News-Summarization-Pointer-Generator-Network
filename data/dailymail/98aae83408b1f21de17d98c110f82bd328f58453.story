Britain's cities risk being 'cast aside' and the poor left behind by politicians obsessed with trying to woo Middle England, the Church of England warned today.

The Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu warned 'rampant consumerism and individualism' have acted to eradicate the glue that holds communities together. 

And the Archbishop of Canterbury claimed that whole towns and regions are trapped in a spiral of economic decline.

The Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu warned 'rampant consumerism and individualism' have acted to eradicate the glue that holds communities together

The criticism comes in a book edited by Dr Sentamu, who acknowledged yesterday that the work promotes left-wing thinking.

In a strongly-worded attack on the Coalition timed for the start of the election build-up, the Most Rev Justin Welby blamed spending cuts and the failure of government to do enough to support recovery in the regions.

In his contribution to the book, titled On Rock or Sand, the Dr Welby said: ‘Our economy appears to be, in one sense, a tale of two cities – one being a growing and constantly improving London and the South East generally, and the other being most, but not all, other cities, alike in that they are each trapped in apparently inevitable decline.’

He said spending cuts have widened the gap and added: ‘The hard truth is that many of these cities are in what appear to be lose-lose situations.

‘Already in decline, the road towards recovery and growth is made even more difficult. 

'There are now fewer readily available Government resources able to support economic development in these regions; and also, since the 1980s, the banking system has become more and more London concentrated and consequently out of touch with local needs.' 

Dr Sentamu's book claims the poor have been ‘left behind’, entire cities have been ‘cast aside’, and that inequality between rich and poor is ‘evil’.

The book amounts to a direct challenge to the Prime Minister and the Conservative Party.

It compares itself to the notorious 1985 Faith in the City report, which condemned Margaret Thatcher’s government and was in turn dismissed by one of her ministers as ‘Marxist’.

In an interview to launch the book, Dr Sentamu told The Daily Telegraph: ‘That sounds extremely left-wing doesn’t it? The truth is it is the theology of where I am coming from. 

'This marrying of justice and self-interest is deeply unfashionable in a political scene where parties rush to outdo each other in enticing and beguiling the swing vote of middle England not with a vision of justice but with appeals to individual preference, interest and consumer choice.”

He added: While many have benefited from the economic progress of past decades, the consequences of this rampant consumerism and individualism – both economic and social – have been to eradicate the glue that holds communities together.

“Astonishingly, this disintegrative process is then expressed in what it means to live a good life.”

The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, said some towns are trapped in a spiral of economic decline due to government spending cuts. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith dismissed the comments as ‘unbalanced and unfair’

Dr Welby’s contribution to the book said: ‘There is a general social assumption that the economy has the power to dictate what is and is not possible for human beings. 

'We believe that if we can fix the economy, the fixing of human beings will automatically follow. That is a lie.

‘It is a lie because it is a narrative that casts money, rather than humanity, as the protagonist of God’s story.’

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith dismissed the Archbishop's comments as ‘unbalanced and unfair’.
