One of the bikers arrested for a vicious attack on a SUV driver has claimed the row began after the motorist threw a bottle of water at the motorcycle gang.

Clint Caldwell, 32, alleges that Alexian Lien, 33, ignited the violence by throwing a water bottle at the cyclists during the incident on the West Side Highway last month.

'You're going to hear that a water bottle was tossed out of the car and that might have provoked some of the anger from the motorcyclists, but he had nothing to do that,' Caldwell's lawyer, Raymond Colon, told reporters.

Claims: Clint Caldwell, 32, alleges that Alexian Lien, 33, ignited the violence by throwing a water bottle at the cyclists during the incident on the West Side Highway last month

'No one can stand here or stand in court and say, "I saw Clint Caldwell punch or attack the driver." They're just not going to be able to do that,' she said reported gothamist.com.

On Friday Mr Lien was seen for the first time since he was brutally assaulted.

The married
father left his Wall Street apartment in a hoodie, baseball cap and 
sunglasses. He was accompanied by a woman believed to be his mother or 
mother-in-law.

He shielded himself from cameras as he hurried down the street in downtown Manhattan and entered a high-rise building.

The emergence of the victim came as four more bikers accused of taking part in the September 29 assault appeared in court.

Hidden: Alexian Lien emerged on Friday from his New York home, the first time he has been seen since he was attacked by a gang of bikers

Terror: Mr Lien was gragged from his car and beaten by bikers on September 29 in front of his wife and two-year-old daughter on a New York highway

Bikers Reginald Chance, Clint Caldwell and Craig Wright, as well as Officer Woljciech Braszczok made court appearances on Friday.

Chance was in court on Friday morning and was the second indicted following Robert Sims.

On Thursday, Sims who can allegedly be seen on video dragging the driver from the SUV and beating him , was indicted.

Investigators continue to work to find out what roles other members of the gang may have played in the attack on a New York highway.

Admission: Matthew Rodriguez, 28, is assigned to the Internal Affairs Bureau and only admitted being part of the ride a few days ago, according to a report

Braszczok also appeared on Friday but 
covered his face with a hoodie on his way in and out of court. He is 
next scheduled to appear in February after he testifies before a grand 
jury.

Caldwell was similarly not indicted and will appear before a grand jury next week.

Suspect
James Kuehne appeared in court on Thursday, as the one who allegedly 
hit Mr Lien repeatedly with his helmet. He has pleaded not guilty.

During
the chaotic incident, Alexian Lien ran over biker Edwin Mieses in his 
SUV. The biker was left with spinal injuries and may be paralyzed.

Lien
said he feared for the safety of his wife and two-year-old daughter who
were in the Range Rover. He has not been charged with any crime.

The developments came as another NYPD officer reportedly came forward and admitted to being part of the biker gang, it was revealed on Thursday. 

Matthew Rodriguez, 28, who is
assigned to the Internal Affairs Bureau (IAB), only admitted being part
of the ride a few days ago, according to a DNAinfo report.

It is unclear whether the five-year veteran played any part in the violence against SUV driver Alexian Lien.

Rodriguez is part of the division which is currently investigating those involved in the attack.

Detective Braszczok, 32, is charged with gang 
assault in the first-degree, assault in the first degree and criminal 
mischief in the third degree over his alleged role in the incident.

Pictured: A bike rider matching Braszczok's description has been identified on YouTube video of the brutal biker gang attack that led to his arrest and charging... and his cover being blown

Hiding: Braszczok, pictured leaving court yesterday, has been undercover for five years, two years with Occupy, and the police and his lawyer say his life is in jeopardy if his face is revealed

His lawyer insisted he would be exonerated by the very video prosecutors claim incriminates him during the September 29 attack.

'The
allegation is that he struck the rear portion hatchback window, which 
has a gaping hole already in it; it's already destroyed,' attorney John 
Arlia said. 'Under the law, it's a fatal flaw. You can't break what's 
already broken.'

Mr 
Arlia said the video clearly shows Braszczok did not participate in the 
eventual attack on the SUV driver and was nowhere near him.

Braszczok
hasn't been charged with assaulting the driver, Alexian Lien, who 
authorities say was pulled from his Range Rover and beaten on the street
by other motorcyclists.
