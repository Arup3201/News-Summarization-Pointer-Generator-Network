FIFA's opposition to all things British includes having no representative from the Home Nations on the technical study group that analyses all 64 matches of the World Cup.

Instead the 13-strong group, whose report after the tournament always has much importance attached to it, includes representatives from football outposts such as Sudan and Hong Kong who have never been near a World Cup finals.

Other countries whose delegates will be running the rule over England’s methods in training as well as games include El Salvador, New  Zealand, Romania, Japan, Nigeria and Jamaica.

Thinker: Roy Hodgson was due to take part in UEFA's TSG for Euro 2012

Former Scotland manager Andy Roxburgh had been a long-time member of FIFA’s TSG at six previous World Cups while England boss manager Roy Hodgson helped compile the technical report for the 2006 World Cup and was due to be part of UEFA’s TSG for Euro 2012 until taking over the national team beforehand.

However, the only member of the 2014 report team with any allegiance to English football is France’s Gerard Houllier, the former Liverpool manager.

Asked about the conspicuous absence of a
 British representative, a FIFA spokeswoman said: ‘The TSG members are 
alternating from World Cup to World Cup. This time there is no British 
as other countries are represented.’

Running the rule: Former Liverpool boss Gerard Houllier is among the 13-man group

lt has taken only one day for the police-escorted England commute from Rio hotel to training base to take longer than the time considered acceptable.

That was 30 to 40 minutes and after a 39-minute trip on Monday, the route took 45 minutes on Tuesday.

The FA blamed the police outriders turning up late and a spokesman said: ‘The manager is happy with the journey, which is the most important thing.’

Pele, interviewed by Gary Lineker for Tuesday night’s BBC documentary The Beautiful Game, said it would be no surprise to see England in the World Cup final because of their experience.

However, this is the same Pele who had Nicky Butt as player of the tournament in 2002 before England’s quarter-final exit.

Looking tidy: The FA are looking to extend their kit deal with Nike

The FA are planning to start talks about a new kit deal with Nike well in advance of the Euro 2016 finals despite the contract running until 2018.

And the FA will want far more control in future following concern inside Wembley at how they copped the blame for the £90 replica kit, including the wrath of Prime Minister David Cameron, rather than the kit suppliers.

All signs are pointing to the 2014 World Cup being the most shambolic tournament in FIFA history.

FA delegates, including chairman Greg Dyke, took up to four hours to travel from Sao Paulo airport to the FIFA congress location outside the gridlocked city with others taking even longer.

The gift of a Longines watch and a  Brazuca football will not compensate.

And a mass demonstration by more than 100,000 locals — disgruntled at the cost of the World Cup — is due to take place in Rio on Thursday to coincide with the opening game.

Delayed: Greg Dyke was among those held up in Sao Paulo

No wonder FIFA officials are keeping their passes out of sight, VIP transport has no FIFA branding and president Sepp Blatter has a huge security detail around him.

The chaos is summed up by Helio Gurovitz, the editor of local weekly magazine Epoca: ‘We are the country of winging it. We plan poorly, monitor even worse, leave everything to the last hour and believe it will work out in the end. Until, one day, it doesn’t.’

The odious Ricardo Teixeira, English-hating former overlord of Brazilian football who severed all connections from the game in 2012 under the weight of corruption scandals, is understood to have used what remains of his influence to shore up his daughter Joana’s executive director position on the World Cup’s local organising committee. 

Her place was under threat following her rash Twitter comment — especially given her father’s situation — about World Cup money being ‘stolen’.
