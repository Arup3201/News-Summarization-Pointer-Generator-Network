A mother and daughter who swindled nearly £50,000 in identical disability benefit scams  have escaped jail.

Wendy Perry, 66, pocketed £28,500 of taxpayers' cash over a five-year period while employed as a medical secretary for the NHS, Wolverhampton Crown Court was told.

At the same time her daughter Nicola Manson-Perry collected £20,404 while working as a hospital accounts clerk in a carbon copy fraud, which lasted nine years.

The pair had denied charges of benefit fraud but were found guilty by juries in two separate trials in February.

Both Perry and Manson-Perry received the Disability Living Allowance (DLA) payouts after claiming they could hardly walk unaided, the court was told. 

Perry, who worked for Sandwell General Hospital in West Bromwich, claimed she had to hold on to a wall for balance to ensure she didn't fall.

She also claimed she had difficulty communicating and filling in forms, and even increased the pay out by stating she needed constant care both day and night.

But she was rumbled when Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) investigators spent four days secretly filming her walking to her car at a hospital in April 2013.

The clear footage shows Perry, who even parked in a disabled bay, strolling to her vehicle quickly without any aids and with no sign of a limp.

Investigators then widened their probe to include her daughter and it was discovered Manson-Perry, who is married without children, was also picking up DLA payouts.

The 48-year-old, who has worked for the NHS since 2004 as a £22,000-a-year accounts clerk, was claiming it took her ten minutes to walk two metres.

Both women were arrested by police at the home they share in Wednesbury, West Midlands, on August 21, 2013.

Joseph Millington, defending Perry, said Manson-Perry had now been sacked from Birmingham's City Hospital and her mother expected the same fate.

Perry was handed a nine-month jail sentence, suspended for 12 months,  on Friday.

Her daughter was given a 34-week sentence, suspended for two years, last month.

Recorder Julian Taylor showed sympathy with the mother, who has worked for the NHS since 1995, because 'life had dealt her a bad hand' and she had a long history of health problems.

He said: 'This offending does cross the custody threshold but she is sitting here staring at me and I want her to know she will not be going to prison today.' 

Judge Robin Onions, sentencing Manson-Perry, told her: 'At some stage your mobility significantly increased and I am satisfied you knew that.

'Two work colleagues said they did not notice any restriction to your mobility.

'At no stage did you need mobility aids as you walked from your car to the office and walked along corridors to meetings.

'You convinced yourself that because you had other medical problems this, in some sense, justified you in continuing in this unjustified claim.

'You should now discuss with your mother how you are jointly going to pay back the debt you owe to the state.' 

A spokesperson for the DWP said: 'Benefit payments should go to those who really need them.

'We know it's a small minority of people who commit benefit fraud, but deliberately not informing us of a change in your condition that may affect your claim is a crime.

'Don't wait for our fraud investigators to find you - tell us of a change now. If you suspect someone of fraudulently claiming benefits, then call our National Benefit Fraud Hotline on 0800 854 440.'
