Lee Wallace is determined not to let 14 minutes of meltdown define an entire season at Rangers. As far as he is concerned, the fightback starts now.

Wallace has listened to the flood of criticism that engulfed Ibrox in the wake of Monday night’s 3-1 home defeat from Hibs, which contained that extraordinary sequence of first-half concessions.

Manager Ally McCoist bore the brunt of the uproar, with his position being openly questioned in some quarters, but Wallace would prefer to look in the mirror and to those who sit beside him in the dressing-room. He doesn’t hide from that fact that, bar maybe one game, the players simply haven’t met the standards they should have reached in the Championship.

Yet the 27-year-old left-back also has a sense that obituaries of their campaign are being written far too early.

A six-point deficit has seen Rangers replaced by Hearts as favourites for the second-tier title by some bookmakers. The Ibrox club, according to that strand of opinion, are in danger of seeing their off-field woes being replicated on the pitch as their hopes drift away.

Wallace logs such predictions away for future use. Expecting to see an instant response in Saturday’s trip to Livingston, he remains steadfast in his belief that Rangers will find real form and ultimately achieve their goals.

‘I definitely think it will come,’ he said. ‘I have a belief that we can do it.

‘I’ve got a feeling that we are being written off and the manager is being questioned. That goes with the territory but I believe that, with the boys we have here, we will be fine come the end of the season.

‘We have to use the criticism positively. We know it happens and you are never going to get away from that. We are a bit more scrutinised here but we are ready for it and it’s up to us to go out there and make it better.’

Wallace wasn’t a chief culprit against Hibs but was still one component of a back four that simply disintegrated once the first goal was leaked.

Rangers have defeated Premiership opposition this term and dismantled a decent Raith Rovers outfit on their own patch.

Wallace is well aware, however, that league success is founded upon steady runs of results. And be believes that is primarily the responsibility of those who actually cross the white line.

‘We have got to do a lot more as players. I look at the 11 or 12 games we’ve played so far and, Raith aside and the Inverness result, there has been no consistency in our performances. We have to find that quickly or we are going to fall behind. We have to get started soon.

‘The buck stops with us first and foremost. It’s a collective thing between the players and management. Only a couple of times this season have we found that consistency we need and that’s been the disappointing thing for me.

‘We wanted to make a mark as early as we could. We wanted to be sitting top of the league and to be the team everybody is talking about.

‘It’s early in the season and that’s the only positive thing. We have certainly got time and we, as players, have to start doing better on the pitch.’

McCoist led the internal inquest this week but has also tried to rally spirits and galvanise the squad ahead of their return to action. Having also lost at home to Hearts, the margin of error available to Rangers has been significantly reduced.

‘We’ve looked at the stuff from the Hibs game on the video and the manager has gone into it in detail,’ said Wallace.

‘He wasn’t happy and he was getting his message across. Now it’s up to us to respond on the park.

‘It was an open forum as we were watching the video. The players had things to say, as did the management. That’s the best way - we can both reflect, look at how we can get better and move on. Anybody can speak up.

‘At half time on Monday night a couple of the lads spoke up and at the end the dressing room was not a good place to be.

‘The manager has got us focused on the next game now. We can’t get too downbeat about it. It was disappointing in the aftermath. It’s not a great feeling when you get beat at home but you need to quickly forget about that and don’t go into the next game mumping and moaning with heads down.

‘It’s a big one for us at Livingston and the players are looking forward to it. We need to start building a bit of momentum.’

The confidence currently coursing through Hearts was underlined when Kevin McHattie this week spoke about the possibility of an unbeaten league campaign.

Wallace is admiring of the start made by his former club, under the command of Robbie Neilson, but cautions them against thinking too far ahead.

‘Hearts are obviously going in the right direction,’ he admitted. ‘We wanted to hit the ground running because there were a lot of questions asked about playing against full-time opposition this season.

‘We wanted to answer that quickly but I think in time we will grow into it, build a bit of momentum and we will get back to playing football in the Premiership.’
