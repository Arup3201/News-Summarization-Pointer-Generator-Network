Drug mules Michaella McCollum and Melissa Reid are in brilliant health in a modern well-equipped prison, an Irish priest said last night.

Father Maurice Foley visited the pair in Peru last Saturday where he found them sitting under a parasol in a yard in the jail drinking coffee and making phone calls.

'They are brilliant. Very, very well,' he said. 'They weren't in a cell. They were out in a wide open space sitting at a table with a parasol, they were talking and drinking coffee.

In 'good form': Michaella McCollum and Melissa Reid, pictured from left to right arriving in handcuffs for a court hearing in Callao, Peru, yesterday evening, are said to be 'very, very well' after being moved to a new prison

'As well as that they had telephone communication and they could use it for calling home. I thought they were in great form actually.'

Father Foley, who had to wait a month to be allowed in to visit the young women because of a flu outbreak in the prison, said the pair can sit out all day every day and make as many calls as they wish, so long as they have money to cover it.

His remarks come as the two appeared for a private hearing with a judge at Sarita Colonia del Callao jail, in Callao, near Lima, yesterday looking healthy and apparently with new items of clothing, including new shoes.

McCollum even had a new hairdo - getting rid of her trademark bun in exchange for long, straight locks.

Last week McCollum, 20, from Dungannon, Co Tyrone, and co-accused Reid, 20, from Glasgow, pleaded guilty to drug smuggling when they appeared before a judge.

They had hoped the behind-closed-doors admission would be enough to secure a shorter sentence.Â

However, the prosecutor in charge of their case said that the pair could face a six-month investigation if their guilty pleas are rejected.

Speaking after yesterday's hearing, Juan Mendoza said that the women's confessions had not satisfied prosecutors.

If their pleas are turned down by the court, prosecutors could force them to return to the interrogation room and give more details about the smuggling gang which allegedly gave them the drugs.

Mr Mendoza refused to say whether or not the women had told him anything more about the gang.

They were moved to the modern jail after spending time in the harsh Virgen de Fatima prison in Lima.

Story: Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum initially claimed they had been kidnapped and forced to board a flight with cocaine hidden inside their luggage

Father Foley said he did not speak to the pair about their legal case.

But
he said that he took McCollum to one side during the visit and advised 
her that she should not expect to secure a sentence as low as one year. 
The priest said he expected a seven year sentence, which could be 
reduced at a later stage.

McCollum
was very emotional when the priest warned her about the jail sentence. 
He said the women were sadder and wiser for the experience.

Father
Foley also suggested they might get moved to a new prison in the north 
of Lima after sentencing which has an area dedicated for foreigners.

The priest said local media reports had not done the women any favours, with stories saying that they had "behaved badly" in Ibiza and were then sent to Peru to act as mules.

Hearing: The pair will be asked to expand on their statements before their guilty pleas are accepted

Father Foley said the prosecutors 
want the girls to hand over names and addresses of the gang who coerced 
them into the trafficking.

'They
don't have that. All they have is the name of a cockney Englishman by 
the name of Jake or Joe and that's no good,' he said.

'I
think they just don't have that information themselves. My firm belief 
is that they were conned, they were backed into a compromising situation
and their handlers worked on that and got them to go to customs with 
drugs.

'What very 
likely happened was that people coming behind them in the queue in the 
airport were the ones who walked through with the drugs.'

McCollum
and Reid initially claimed they were kidnapped, held at gunpoint and 
forced to board a flight from Lima to Spain with 24lbs of cocaine in 
food packets hidden inside their luggage when they were arrested.
