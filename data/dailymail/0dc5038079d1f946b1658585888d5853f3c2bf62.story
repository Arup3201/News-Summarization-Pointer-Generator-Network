Louis van Gaal has opened up about his management style with Manchester United, insisting he says one sentence to his players in the dressing room before a match.

The Old Trafford boss also revealed that most players in his star studded squad ‘don’t dare’ question his methods and formation.

Van Gaal’s side take on Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday as they look to consolidate a place in the Premier League top four.

‘I always try to be positive to the players as it’s always better to give them a compliment and be positive, rather than negative,’ Van Gaal told Geoff Shreeves of Sky Sports.

‘I ask the players what they find, but I have a lot of corrections, but they have to agree with me otherwise they cannot perform at the next time.'

Shreeves asks whether van Gaal accepts players challenging his tactics or methods and the Dutchman chuckles before revealing: ‘Most of the players don’t dare to do that but when they have good arguments I listen.

‘When their argument is better than mine than I’d look at changing my ideas. Which system I play is not interesting, it is the philosophy that is important.

Van Gaal has a reputation across European football as meticulously preparing for matches, with constant analysis, discussion, many meetings and videos of training.

However the 63-year-old only gives one sentence to his players on match day: ‘The team is as a whole, they all sit in front of me and then I say one sentence…"Show yourself today” or “No red card because it will be a very sharp duel”.’

He feels this is important as it forces the players to prepare for themselves : ‘Because I have prepared for the match together with the players already for three or four days. What do I need to say then?

‘I want to transfer to the players that they need to think for themselves in the match, they have to decide by themselves. Otherwise they have to wait until half-time so that I can say something.

‘I believe that players can read the game, that they have to coach their fellow players
