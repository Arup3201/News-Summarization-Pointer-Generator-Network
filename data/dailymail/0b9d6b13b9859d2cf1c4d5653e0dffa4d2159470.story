Emergency cash could be found to avoid a chronic shortage of lorry drivers leading to crisis in food supplies.

George Osborne is examining plans to offer funding to help with training of new drivers, amid warnings of shortage of 45,000 hauliers.

Tests which have been blamed for the problems in the industry could also be accelerated to address the shortage of qualified drivers.

The haulage industry warns that shortage of 45,000 drivers has been caused in part by new rules forcing hauliers to be tested on their driving skills

Britain needs between 45,000 and 60,000 extra lorry drivers, according to estimates.

There is a long-running shortage caused by drivers retiring and too few young people choosing haulage as a career.

And since September, all drivers must obtain the Driver Certificate of Professional Competence, completing an extra 35 hours training, costing some £500.

Under the new rules, drivers who do not hold the new certificate face a fine of £1,000.

As many as 20,000 drivers are thought to have quit or retired as a result.

The Road Haulage Association wants Chancellor George Osborne to offer funding to train a new generation of drivers - especially women - in next month's Autumn Statement.

New training rules mean the logistics industry is thousands of drivers short, according to the UK Commission for Employment and Skills.The Freight Transport Association claims more than 20,000 drivers have quit since September.

It comes after a new Driver Certificate of Professional Competence was introduced across the EU, which meant drivers had to complete an extra 35 hours training, costing some £500.

Hauliers say the rules mean there are not enough people to drive lorries across the country, raising the prospect of 'empty shelves'.

Concerns have also been raised about safety, including the decision to allow 18-year-olds to drive HGVs.

Ahead of the Budget the industry called for £150million to increase training for thousands of drivers before the shortages hit vital supplies.

In his statement to MPs, Mr Osborne stopped short of announcing the money would be found.

But the official Budget red book reveals the government could be ready to step in to provide support for road hauliers.

It states: 'The government will review the speed with which Heavy Goods Vehicle (HVG) driving tests and driver medical assessments currently take place and consider options to accelerate both in order to help address the shortage of qualified HGV drivers.

'The government will also work with road haulage firms on an industry led solution to the driver shortage, including looking at the right level of access to, and funding support for, training.'

Chancellor George Osborne used his Budget to announce a review of the HGV driving tests but stopped short of offering immediate financial support

Fuel duty has been frozen for a fifth year in succession, allowing the Chancellor to boast that motorists have had '£10 off a tank with the Tories'.

Yesterday's move means a 0.54p-per-litre duty rise planned for September 1 will not go ahead.

And the freezing of duty over the five years of the Coalition means the average driver spends £10 less per fill-up than if the controversial 'fuel-price escalator' had been implemented in full. 

Between 2011 and 2016, a typical motorist will have saved £675, the Treasury calculated. It means a saving of £1,400 for a small business with a van, and £21,000 for a haulier.

Road Haulage Association chief executive Richard Burnett said: 'We have put forward a strong, clear argument for why funding is necessary and appropriate. Our lobby for funding support will be even stronger in the coming weeks.'

A Department for Transport spokesman said: 'Increasing the number of qualified lorry drivers is good for British business and good for growth. The government will do all it can to find ways to support this sector and we are working to find industry-led solutions to ensure sufficient drivers to meet the demand.'

Six weeks before Chrismtmas, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin urged people to 'get their shopping done' in case the driver shortage hit the supply of food and presents.

He defended the new EU rules, arguing that drivers need to know how to drive their lorries properly.

But he urged people not to leave their shopping until the last minute, in case supply lines are affected.

'If you're driving a motor vehicle, with the investment you've got in that motor vehicle, it's no bad thing to know what you're doing,' he told the ConservativeHome website.

Asked if there were going to problems with deliveries before Christmas, he replied: 'I hope not. I hope not. I think we'll be all right. But I'd advise everybody to get their shopping done.'
