Executive: City boss Matt Pullen has quit CBRE after being arrested on suspicion of rape after a work event

A City high-flyer with the world's biggest property agent has stepped down after being arrested on suspicion of rape - just two months before he was due to take over as managing director.

Millionaire Matt Pullen has resigned from his senior executive role at CBRE London after an alleged sex attack at the five-star Grange Hotel in the capital.

The 44-year-old is married and lives with his wife in a £1million converted barn in Westerham, Kent, and had been with the company for 20 years until his sudden departure last week.

It is understood that Mr Pullen had attended an afternoon work event with a woman, and later that evening the City of London Police were called to the hotel close to St Paul's Cathedral, and he was arrested on suspicion of rape.

'A man, aged 44, was arrested by
City of London Police on Wednesday, October 31, on suspicion of rape. 
He has subsequently been bailed pending further inquiries,' a City of London Police spokesman said.

Mr Pullen has not been formally charged and is bailed until February next year.

CBRE, which is based in Los Angeles, employs 34,000 around the world and has a turnover of £4.4billion, confirmed that he has left the company.

'Mr Pullen is no longer an employee of CBRE. We can confirm that 
the matter is now the subject of a police investigation with which CBRE 
will fully co-operate. It is now a private matter for the individual 
involved,' a spokesman said.

He was due to start running the UK operation on January 1, but now Ciaran Bird, head of CBRE’s UK retail division, has been promoted in his place.

Claim: Pullen had been at The Grange St Paul's Hotel following an afternoon work event, it is understood

Mr Pullen joined the company as a graduate in 1990 before taking over a role vacated by rugby stars Rob Andrew and Gavin Hastings.

He also gave an interview to the company's website where he said he had no intention on leaving because it offered such wonderful career progression.

He also praised the social part of the job and the business since he joined in his twenties.

'It was really social. The balance of work and play was fantastic. I think it's still like that now.'

He went on: 'The beauty of the company is it leaves you to determine how to handle work and life.'

Mr Pullen rose up the ranks at at CBRE, making a name for himself in its global corporate services division, where he acted for giants like Nokia, Barclays and HSBC.

There was no response at his Kent home last night.
