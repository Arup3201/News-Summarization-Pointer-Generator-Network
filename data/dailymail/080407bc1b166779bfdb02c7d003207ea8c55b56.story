More than 100 Coldstream Guardsmen protecting the Queen at Windsor Castle have contracted scabies – a disease that has not affected the British Army on such a scale since the Korean War.

The outbreak of the highly contagious condition, in which tiny mites lay eggs under the skin causing severe itching, was reported after the guardsmen returned from a military exercise in Germany.

Last night Royal sources insisted that none of the infected troops had come into direct contact with the Royal Family or the public.

The Queen is the regiment’s Colonel-in-Chief and the guardsmen live a few hundred yards from Windsor Castle. Every day, immaculately dressed in red tunics and bearskins, they march to the castle from Victoria Barracks to perform the Changing of the Guard – a spectacle watched by crowds of tourists.

A Ministry of Defence investigation is focusing on the guardsmen’s movements in the weeks leading up to the outbreak. Meanwhile, their bedding and clothing have been removed and they have been issued with special ‘anti-scabicide’ cream.

Scabies is an irritable skin infection caused by tiny parasitic mites that burrow into the skin and lay eggs.

Easily passed from one person to another through close body contact, the mites – known as sarciotes scabiei – normally affect the hands, genitals, abdomen, feet and ankles.

They can also be passed on through clothing, bedding and towels. The mites are too small to be seen with the naked eye and signs of infection include intense itching and a red rash.

Treatment is simple and essential. Permethrin cream or malathion lotion must be applied to the affected areas. Everyone in a household – as well as any sexual partners – must also be treated.

Scabies is usually contracted in highly unhygienic environments. Once the minuscule mites have laid their dozens of eggs, there is a two- to six-week incubation period, after which lesions appear on the victim’s arms, hands, torso and genitalia.

A guardsman said: ‘The Coldstreamers were on an exercise in Germany and must have been lying in a polluted ditch or something. Now the boys are rubbing in scabicide cream like there’s no tomorrow. Everyone is using it – not just the 120 confirmed cases. More than 500 guardsmen are affected.

‘All this is pretty embarrassing for us, and the other Guards regiments are having a great laugh. Beds have been stripped, clothes lockers emptied and offices fumigated. In all my years in the Guards Division I haven’t heard of anything like this.’

Precautions are also being taken in London, where the regiment’s junior soldiers, belonging to Number 7 Company, are based at Wellington Barracks.

Scabies was rife during the First World War but has been less common since then because of improved personal hygiene and healthcare.

Though the disease has affected prisons in Afghanistan, there have been no major outbreaks involving British soldiers there.

The last time the disease affected a large number of British troops is believed to have been during the conflict in Korea from 1950 to 1953. Coldstream sources told The Mail on Sunday that when the outbreak was identified, the regiment’s medical staff advised that all military training involving bodily contact should cease until the scabies was eradicated. Despite that, many guardsmen then took part in exercises at a training centre at Lydd in Kent, after which the outbreak continued.

Last night, the Ministry of Defence said that accommodation used by the guardsmen at Lydd was now being deep-cleaned. A spokesman insisted, however, that the regiment’s Commanding Officer had followed medical advice. The soldiers who caught scabies later had received written advice based on national guidance and practices suggested by the Thames Valley Health Protection Agency.

A week ago the MoD confirmed that 120 guardsmen had contracted scabies. Yesterday 65 were still affected.

The Coldstream Guards is the British Army’s oldest regiment in continuous service, having been raised by General George Monck in 1650. The regiment’s motto is ‘nulli secundus’, meaning ‘second to none’, and the guardsmen have seen service in all major conflicts, most recently in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The regiment’s most famous former officers include ex-SAS commander General Sir Michael Rose. Its current crop includes Captain John Scarlett – son of former MI6 chief Sir John Scarlett – who was recently awarded a Military Cross for outstanding gallantry in Helmand, Afghanistan.

Last night, Buckingham Palace declined to comment but an MoD spokesman said: ‘A small number of cases of scabies have been identified at Victoria Barracks.

‘The unit has arranged for specialist cleaning of bedding and clothing, and a deep-clean of living and work areas. Personnel will be fit to return to duties 24 hours after their first treatment. There is an ongoing investigation. However, it may not be possible to find out how or where the initial cases were infected.’
