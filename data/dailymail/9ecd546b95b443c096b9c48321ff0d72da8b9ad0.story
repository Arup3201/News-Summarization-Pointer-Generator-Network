Hurricane Fly attempts to make more history at Leopardstown  with trainer Willie Mullins admitting a slight drying in conditions will be in the favour of big rival Jezki.

Victory for the 11-year-old in the BHP Insurances Irish Champion Hurdle would be his fifth in the race, surpassing the record of the great Istabraq.

Ruby Walsh’s mount, who boasts an unbeaten nine-race record at Leopardstown and is also chasing a 22nd Grade One win, holds a 4-2 advantage in his clashes with Jezki, winner of Britain’s Champion Hurdle last March.

That record includes a half-length verdict for Hurricane Fly in the Ryanair Hurdle at the track’s Christmas meeting, the narrowest margin between the pair in their clashes at Leopardstown.

Mullins said: ‘Our fellow really excels on soft ground, so it's probably not ideal, but at this stage we have to take what we get. Hurricane Fly is a small but very strong horse with a big heart and he doesn't like to lose, winning is part of his make-up and he's very determined.

‘You wouldn't think he was an 11-year-old on a morning. Early in his career he missed races through injuries and needed time out every so often as he was so strong and wilful.’

The six-horse line-up also includes Arctic Fire, stablemate of Hurricane Fly and third in the Ryanair Hurdle.

Mullins also saddles exciting Un De Sceaux in the Arkle Novices’ Chase on the same card. The seven-year-old is already hot favourite for the equivalent race at the Cheltenham Festival.
