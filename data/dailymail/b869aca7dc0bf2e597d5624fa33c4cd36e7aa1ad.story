A Washington state high school has been playing Justin Bieber's hit song 'Baby' on repeat between classes to torture the students into donating money to charity.

On Monday morning, student government president Connor Stakelin announced he was going to blast the pop song through the halls of Tenino High School until pupils raised $500.

But it didn't take long for it to work: they had raised $915.64 by first period on Tuesday.

Cruel: Tenino student government president, Connor Stakelin, preps the school's intercom system to play Justin Bieber's 'Baby' on loop on Monday as a way to raise $500 for an orphanage in Ghana

Success: Stakelin (in green) watches as sophomore Lucas Edwards collects change for the unique fundraiser on Monday - but by Tuesday they had surpassed their goal, raising more than $900

'For some of them it's incentive to donate because they don't want to hear it anymore,' Stakelin told King5 after he pressed 'play' on Monday.

'Oh my God my head is about to explode 
right now,' student Zack Chamberlain said as the song played. 'I'm pretty sure I've had 
five Ibuprofen already.'

Another student, Jasmine Moore, said: 'It's getting very bad. I just want to go home.'

By Monday afternoon, they had raised $332 and the final total was reached by Tuesday morning.

The
 unique fundraiser, which played the song on repeat during passing 
periods and at lunch, will help improve the lives of 254 orphans at a 
school in Ghana.

Plea: Edwards encourages fellow students to drop change in his bucket to stop the music

The community has been supporting the African school on the suggestion of Tenino Elementary School Principal Dave Ford and now the high school hopes to raise at least $1,200 in total.

They say this will be enough to provide food and school supplies for the orphans at Crossover International Academy through April.

'They don't even have a bed to lie on at night and in their school they don't even have more than one piece of paper per day,' Stakelin told King 5.

Ford added: 'We kind of have this forest fire of 
passion, compassion and empathy. They understand the 
connection between needs, wants and other peopleâ€™s reality.'

The song of choice, 'Baby', was released in January 2010 and became the most viewed video on YouTube in July 2010 - before it was overtaken by PSY's Gangnam Style in November 2012.
