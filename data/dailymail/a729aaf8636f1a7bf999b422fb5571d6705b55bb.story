Mother-of-three Sarah Burge justifies giving her daughters Botox injections

A mother-of-three, dubbed the 'Human Barbie' because of her obsession with plastic surgery, has been slammed by a U.S. chat show host.

Anderson Cooper was forced to cut a TV interview with Sarah Burge short  as she justified giving her teenage daughter Botox injections.

'I would prefer to oversee my daughter's Botox than have her going underground finding a voodoo witchdoctor or getting it off the internet and administrating it herself,' she said defiantly.

But appalled by her behaviour, Anderson shook his head in disbelief stating: 'I try and to be really polite to all my guests.

'I just think you're dreadful and I honestly don’t want to talk to you anymore, so I’m just going to stop.'

The 51-year-old, self-confessed plastic surgery addict recently relocated to the U.S. to launch her eight-year-old Poppy as a child beauty pageant star, believing she could give the stars of the controversial show Toddlers & Tiaras a run for their money.

However her insistence on teaching her young daughters to pole dance, giving them vouchers to spend on plastic surgery and throwing them Botox parties is proving unpopular on both sides of the Atlantic.

Following the show Anderson added: 'I regret having here on in the first place.

'I think encouraging her little daughter to pole dance and giving her plastic surgery vouchers and then telling the media about it...

'I wish her the best, I certainly don’t want to be rude to anybody.'

Miss Burge, who has spent more than £500,000 on her own surgical enhancements, first made headlines in 2010 when she confessed to teaching her then six-year-old daughter to pole dance.

And she has since been in the spotlight numerous times - for all the wrong reasons.

Last year Miss Burge, who then resided in a £500,000 four-bedroom home in St Neots, Cambridgeshire, boasted that she gave a £6,000 breast enlargement voucher to her daughter.

She said in an interview with Closer magazine at the time: 'Poppy begged me for a boob job, so I gave her the voucher so she can have it after she's 16, when it's legal. If she develops naturally big boobs, she can have something else done with it.'

The voucher was part of a £12,000 'exotic pamper party' that she organised to mark her daughter's birthday. Poppy and seven friends had manicures, pedicures and makeovers. They dressed up with fake tattoos, drank pretend champagne in the back of a pink pamper bus and ate a designer cake costing £250.

'I honestly don't want to talk to you anymore so I'm just going to stop,' Anderson told Miss Burge

Poppy wore a £300 dress for the party, adding nail varnish, eyeshadow and hair extensions. Miss Burge said: 'Poppy isn't interested in bouncy castles or pass the parcel, so I splashed out on something a little more grown-up.

'The girls got lots of attention from our neighbours. They love having all eyes on them and were posing and pouting for photos,' she said.

As well as the breast enlargement voucher, Miss Burge bought her daughter thousands of pounds worth of gifts, including a £250 computer, a £450 pink Swarovski crystal ring and necklace set and the promise of a £4,000 spa break. The main event though, was the breast enlargement voucher.

Poppy said: 'I wanted a new computer, a holiday and a voucher for surgery. When I got it all, it was a dream come true. All my friends were jealous.

'I can't wait to be like Mummy with big boobs. They're pretty.'

Anderson also asked Burge to explain the photos of her eight-year-old daughter (who was seven at the time) on a stripper pole, and points out, 'It doesn't just happen to wind up in the paper, you contact the British tabloids, you contact the papers and let them know about this stuff.'

Burge responded: 'I let people know that it's good, it's good exercise and in fact, more people should actually try it than stuffing their faces with burgers.'
