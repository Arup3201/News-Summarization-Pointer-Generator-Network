Cristiano Ronaldo has been passed fit for Saturday's Madrid derby and the Portuguese superstar is hoping to be crowned king of the capital as Real Madrid take on Atletico Madrid in their La Liga clash.

Real are trailing their local rivals after the opening two rounds, but they are hoping to win back the bragging rights after seeing Atletico lift last season's trophy.

While Real vs Barcelona, otherwise known as 'El Clasico', has traditionally been regarded as the most important match in Spanish football, Marca have now begun to label the Madrid derby as the biggest fixture.
