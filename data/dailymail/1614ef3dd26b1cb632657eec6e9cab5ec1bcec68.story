Manchester United striker Robin van Persie could have been in severe trouble after appearing to elbow West Ham defender James Tomkins.

The Dutchman clashed with Tomkins during the first-half of the 1-1 draw at Upton Park on Sunday but did not receive a booking despite being in full view of referee Mark Clattenburg.

Sportsmail's Graham Poll has praised Calttenburg's decision making, having officiated another high profile encounter.

Mark Clattenburg once again had an excellent game - confirming his position as the top referee in the Premier League. When Robin van Persie caught James Tomkins with a flailing arm he did not overreact but correctly awarded a free-kick and spoke to the Dutchman.

However, when he needed to show cards he did and was correct when showing Luke Shaw his second yellow card and then a red for his reckless tackle shortly after Manchester United had equalised. 

Clattenburg has returned to the Premier League with two very good high-profile performances - Chelsea v Manchester City last weekend and now this match. More top games must follow.
