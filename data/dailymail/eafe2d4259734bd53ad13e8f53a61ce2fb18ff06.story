Forget printing your own photos, now you can print and make your own pinhole camera from a cereal box.

An art graduate from Brighton has designed a retro-looking pinhole camera made from cardboard, a paperclip and a soft drinks can.

The camera, called Videre, which is Latin for 'to see', takes photos using medium-format film and is put together using folds and glue.

A Brighton art graduate has designed a pinhole camera out of a cereal box and soft drinks can. Photos are projected onto a strip of medium-format film when a cardboard flap is moved over the pinhole. Inventor Kelly Angood is now selling the design kit so other people can make it too

The design for Angood's cardboard pinhole camera was inspired by some of her favourite retro cameras. The camera doesn't have a lens; instead it has a hole which is covered by a cardboard insert. When the insert is removed, light travels through the hole and projects the photo on a strip of medium-format film

A pinhole camera is a camera without a lens.

It has a small hole in one side that acts as an aperture to let in light.

When
you point the camera at an object, light from the object travels through the hole and projects an inverted 
image on the film along the opposite side of the box.

This technique is similar to how eyes see and process images.

The smaller the hole, the sharper the image, yet the dimmer it will appear.

A pinhole camera's shutter is manually operated by a flap of card, for example.

Designer Kelly Angood is now selling the design so others can print and make their own DIY cameras at home. 

Angood, 24 from Dalston in east London, came up with idea for the camera when she was a student in Brighton three years ago.

She said she knew she'd never be able to afford a medium-format camera so designed a model that she could make herself.

It was designed from different elements of Angood's favourite cameras.

She said: 'It goes back to the basics of photography and teaches you the fundamentals.'

'It's easy to use and the results are lovely'.

She also designed a 35mm version of the camera.

She offered the design for this smaller camera for free as a PDF download from her website.

But Angood has now set up a Kickstarter campaign so she can ship the cardboard designs, and all the materials needed to make the camera, to customers.

The Kickstarter project ends on 18 May 2013.

It has already received over £28,000 worth of funding, from more than 670 backers.

Once the funding for the project closes, Angood will print the die-cut kit onto thick recycled card.

The kit wlll also come with instructions and a spare medium-format spool.

Angood will also be producing an instructional video.

Photos taken using the camera will then be added to an online gallery, and can be submitted by Videre owners.

However, Angood states on her Kickstarter page that the kits won't be delivered until November.

In the meantime, Angood has also designed a 35mm version of the camera and anyone who pledges to the fund will get a downloadable PDF of this kit.

The film used in both camera designs will need to be processed either in a DIY dark room, or at a photography shop.
