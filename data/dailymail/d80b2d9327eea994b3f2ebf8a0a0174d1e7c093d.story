Theo Walcott could make his long-awaited return to action in time for the North London derby later this month.

The Arsenal forward has been on the sidelines since suffering a serious knee injury playing against Tottenham in the FA Cup third round in January.

And it is hoped the England international will be available for the clash against the Gunners' arch rivals on September 27.

Walcott is making pleasing progress from the injury that ruled him out of the final five months of last season and the World Cup.

The 25-year-old's return to full training is imminent and it is hoped he will be available to make his first-team return by the end of September.

His pending return will come as a huge boost to Arsene Wenger, who is short of viable centre-forward options following the four month injury to Olivier Giroud.

The £16million capture of Danny Welbeck will help ease the blow of Giroud's loss, as will the return of Walcott, who has played through the middle on several occasions for the Gunners.
