The cat has been Ms Bennelle's only companion since her husband passed away.

Ms Bennelle, of Heathcote which is north of Melbourne, had been praying for Olly's return ever since it went missing in August last year.

'I think someone is looking after me up there,' Ms Bennelle told Nine News. 

The feline was given to Ms Bennelle as a Christmas gift six years ago but was originally named Holly.

'When I took her to the vets they said "she's not a Holly, she's an Olly",' Ms Bennelle said.  

Olly was found by council rangers two days ago in Watsonia, north-east of Melbourne, which is 108km away from his home.
