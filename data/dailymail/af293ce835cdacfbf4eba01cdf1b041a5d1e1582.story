Russian scientists are celebrating successfully bringing up a sample from an Antarctic lake that has been buried beneath ice for at least 100,000 years.

The announcement was made just weeks after a British expedition to extract water from an Antarctic lake gave up and headed for home.

The Russian team initially drilled more than two miles into ice to reach the surface of Lake Vostock last year.

They managed to bring up a sample, some of which was served to President Vladimir Putin, but it was uncertain if the water can from the lake or the glacier above it.

Having returned to Antarctica the scientific team extracted a further sample which, according to the Russian state-owned news agency Ria Novosti, was from the lake itself.

The project team relied on the huge pressure the lake is under to force water up into last year’s borehole where it froze and could be extracted in cores, it was reported.

‘The first core of transparent lake ice, 2 meters long, was obtained on January 10 [2013] at a depth of 3,406 meters,’ the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute, part of the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring, was quoted as saying.

‘Inside it was a vertical channel filled with white bubble-rich ice.’

The core is now to be tested to see if any microbial life has persisted Lake Vostock, which at 1,300 cubic miles in volume is the largest lake in Antarctica and one of the biggest in the world.

There are more than 400 sub-glacial lakes in Antarctica and they are attracting scientific attention in part because they represent environments similar to those that might harbour life elsewhere in the solar system, such as Jupiter's frozen moon Europa.

Analysis of samples from last year’s Lake Vostock expedition yielded nothing alive except for a few microbes which are feared to have been through contamination.

The British Antarctic Survey gave up its attempt to break through to Lake Ellsworth in December.

However, a US-led Antarctic expedition announced in November that they had detected microbes thriving in the slushy centre of the otherwise frozen Lake Vida.

The microbes had been sealed off by ice for at least 2,800 years and were living without oxygen in salty, acidic water which would be toxic to many lifeforms.

In Lake Vostock any microbes would have to have survived frozen beneath ice for at least 100,000 years and perhaps for millions of years.

In December the British Antacrtic Survey had to abandon an attempt to reach Lake Ellsworth through almost 1.8 miles of ice by drilling with water at close to boiling point.

It was defeated by technical problems at it tried to link the main borehole with a secondary hole that was to be used to syphon off water.
