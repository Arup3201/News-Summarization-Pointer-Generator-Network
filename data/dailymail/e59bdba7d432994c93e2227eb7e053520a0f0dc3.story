Eric Dier became an instant hero when he scored the winner deep in added time at Upton Park, but who is the Tottenham new boy?

Dier, 20, signed for Spurs from Sporting Lisbon for £4 million this summer and might have expected to be a squad man in his first season.

Born in Cheltenham, Dier and his family moved to Portugal when he was seven and he was spotted by Sporting Lisbon.

The Portuguese wanted him to gain dual nationality but he has since represented England at Under-18, Under-19, Under-20 and Under-21 level. Umbro also picked him as a face of England’s future.
