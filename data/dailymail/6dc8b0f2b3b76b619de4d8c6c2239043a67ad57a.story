'Honeytrap': British professor Paul Frampton has landed up in jail after he was allegedly caught with drugs trying to board a plane in South America

A distinguished British scientist languishing in an Argentine jail on suspicion of drug smuggling has spoken for the first time about his ordeal.

Oxford University graduate Paul Frampton has been held in prison since January after being stopped at an airport in Buenos Aires as he tried to board a plane to Peru with two kilos of cocaine in his suitcase.

He claimed afterwards he was the victim of a honey-trap sting involving an internet model.

Last night he named the beauty - a 32-year-old Czech-born glamour model now based in the U.S - for the first time as he spoke about his fears he may die in jail if convicted.

Mr Frampton said he thought he was swapping messages on a dating site with stunning Denise Milani - but now believes members of a South American mafia tricked him into carrying a suitcase carrying drugs by posing as the underwear model.

There is no suggestion the model had any
involvement in the drugs smuggling plot - or knew a mafia was allegedly
using her identity for honey-trap stings.

Last night influential friends in the scientific community continued to fight for his release on bail as he faced the prospect of a 16-year-jail sentence, if convicted.

Extraordinary details of the events leading up to his arrest emerged - including a 10 day stay in Bolivia waiting for Miss Milani to join him for the start of a new life together before his fateful trip to Argentina.

Worcestershire-born Mr Frampton, 68, awarded a BA degree with Double First Class Honours at Oxford, said: 'Perhaps I should have realised earlier but the fraudster was very good and very intelligent.

'I never thought these sorts of people existed. For 11 weeks I thought I was chatting with an attractive woman.'

Divorced Mr Frampton was arrested on January 23 at Ezieza International Airport, moments before he boarded a plane to Peru for a second flight to the U.S where he is now teaches.

The drugs were found wrapped in gift paper inside the lining of the suitcase.

Mr Frampton claims he was given the 
suitcase at a hotel in Buenos Aires by a Hispanic-looking middle-aged 
man who told him it belonged to the model.

The
scientist flew to Argentina after a 10-day stay in Bolivia where he 
thought he was going to meet Miss Milani, born Denise Trlica and best 
known for her natural 32DD chest which helped her become 2007 'Miss 
Bikini World' and a favourite with readers of mens' magazines Maxim and 
FHM.

Czech-born Denise Milani has somehow been involved in the case of Paul Frampton. There is nothing to suggest the lingerie model knew that her identity was being used

Mr Frampton said he believed he was in contact with Miss Milani and said he believed they were internet lovers

He told an Argentine newspaper he planned to take the suitcase to Brussels in Belgium for a new meeting with his internet girlfriend.

However, he was persuaded by a friend to book a flight back to his home in America and forget Miss Milani.

Investigators are said to have carried out psychological tests on Mr Frampton to rule out mental illness.

Mr Frampton, who is suffering from lung problems following his enforced stay in prison, admitted last night he may be suffering from a mental disorder brought on by his obsession with psychics.

The scientist's ex-wife has described him as being very 'naive' emotionally.

He told respected Argentine newspaper Clarin from his prison cell: 'The person I thought was this woman told me she liked older men and was tired of doing photo sessions.

'I fell for the story. Before my arrest on January 23 I was convinced I was chatting with a "her" and after a couple of weeks in prison, I realised it was a man, a criminal posing as this model.

'"She" asked me if I could be proud of someone like "her". It was quite convincing.

'I found out I wasn't going to meet her in Bolivia as planned the day I got there.

'I should have returned to the States right then. But I always complete my plans, the same way I complete my physics papers. She was my project.'

He added: 'It didn't seem strange to me at the time that this person invited me to meet up with her in Bolivia.

'The idea was to go there and return with her a couple of days later to the place where I live.'

Mr Frampton, who studied at Brasenose College, one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford, is being held at Villa Devoto Prison in Buenos Aires.

The jail was the scene of some of the worst prison riots in Argentine history in 1978 which left 62 people dead.

Leading academics including 1979 Physics Nobel Prize winner Sheldon Glashow - who Mr Frampton has written more than a dozen scientific articles with - have written to the investigating judge in charge of his case to plead his innocence.

Several have also written a letter to Argentine president Cristina Kirchner asking her to intervene.

Mr Frampton, from Kidderminster in Worcestershire, was teaching at the University of North Carolina when he was arrested and his pay was suspended.

His case mirrors that of New Zealander Sharon Mae Armstrong, who was arrested at Ezeiza International Airport in April last year after five kilos of cocaine were found in her suitcase shortly before she boarded a flight to Spain.

She was convicted and sentenced to four years and ten months in prison in February this year.

Judges convicted her despite accepting her claim she had been set up by a man she met on the internet.

The civil servant arranged to fly to London to meet him after months of online exchanges - but at the last minute flights he had bought her were changed to go via Argentina so she could pick up paperwork he had requested.

She ended up agreeing to take a suitcase to Britain for him with the cocaine hidden inside - and was arrested in April last year before she boarded a British Airways flight.

Her mystery lover and alleged accomplices have never been found.

Miss Armstrong's defence lawyer produced evidence at her trial of south American mafias specialising in honey-trap stings like the one she got caught up in.
