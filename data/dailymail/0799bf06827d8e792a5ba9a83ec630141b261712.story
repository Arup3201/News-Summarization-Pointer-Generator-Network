The family of a girl who was strangled by a teenage neighbor planning to steal her bike parts has launched a lawsuit, saying authorities could have done more to save her.

Autumn Pasquale failed to return to her home in Clayton, New Jersey in October 2012, just days before her 13th birthday. Her disappearance prompted a massive search by officials and locals, but two days later, her body was found dumped in a recycling bin near to the home of Justin Robinson.

Robinson, then 15, has since admitted to luring the young girl to his home to trade bicycle parts before strangling her by 'mistake'.

Now Autumn's father and two siblings have launched a lawsuit against State Police, Gloucester County's Prosecutor Office and several townships, saying that they didn't search for her properly.

Victim: Autumn Paquale was strangled by a teenager who had lured her to his home on the promise of trading bike parts. Her body was found in a recycling bin near to his home two days later

Devastated: Autumn's estranged parents, Jennifer Cornwell and Anthony Pasquale, are pictured in 2012. Autumn's estate - her father and two siblings - has sued authorities, saying that they didn't do enough

'They didn't do the appropriate perimeter search,' family lawyer Gregg Zeff told the Inquirer. 

'They were told specifically by someone who came in where he believed the child was, and they did not want to hear it. And, in fact, that's where she was.'

The lawsuit claims law enforcement 'did not follow appropriate procedures,' including a canvass of the immediate area where the girl vanished, the Courier Post reported.

'If proper and adequate law enforcement techniques would have been employed in this matter, Autumn may have been discovered sooner and a reasonable chance exists that she would have survived,' the lawsuit says. 

Locked up: Justin Robinson is pictured leaving court last year after he pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter and was sentenced to 17 years in prison. He was 15 when he killed the young girl

Accused: Robinson, left, and his brother Dante, right, were both arrested after their mother contacted police about a suspicious message she found. Dante later pleaded guilty to lesser charges and is out of jail

The family is seeking monetary damages - although specific amounts were not laid out - for each of seven counts: two counts of due process violations, a state-created danger, failure to train personnel, wrongful death, willful disregard and negligence, the Courier Post reported.

The lawsuit adds that as well as losing their daughter, 'the parents have also lost any direct financial contributions, which would have been made by the child to her survivors after she became a wage earner'.

It continues: 'They also lost the value of the child's anticipated services to survivors such as household chores and care of siblings.'

It is not the first time the family has expressed their disdain at the police investigation. 

Last year, Autumn's father Anthony threatened to sue, claiming that prosecutor Sean Dalton's office botched the search. But Dalton handed the case over to the prosecutor in Camden County to avoid a legal conflict, the Inquirer reported.

Dalton's office has previously said that Autumn was killed hours before she was reported missing. 

Found: An investigator takes away a bike from the boys' home that matches the description of the white BMX Autumn was seen riding. It emerged she had gone to the  house on the promise of trading bike parts

Autumn Pasquale vanished on October 20 after receiving a Facebook offer to trade bike parts and going to Justin Robinson's house several blocks from her family's home.

Autumn was promised parts for her bike by Justin Robinson and his brother Dante, but the teenagers were really plotting to steal parts from her model, authorities said.

When she didn't return home that night, her family - including her parents, who were estranged - and the community launched a frantic search. Two days later, her body was found in a recycling bin behind the home next to Robinson's.

A break in the case came when the boy's mother, Anita Saunders, called police after seeing a Facebook post from one of her sons containing the word 'Autumn'.

An autopsy concluded Autumn had died from 'blunt force trauma, consistent with strangulation'. She was also beaten. There was no evidence of sexual assault.

Loss: Autumn, pictured left with her mother and right, was remembered as a smiling tomboy and soccer fan

Justin Robinson pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter in August 2013 and admittted strangling the Clayton Middle School student.

As he was sentenced to 17 years behind bars last year, he apologized to the family and said: 'This was not supposed to happen'.

Prosecutors faced difficulties during the trial, including a lack of physical evidence to determine whether Justin or Dante killed Autumn. They also struggled to find a motive for the killing.

But when he pleaded guilty, Justin Robinson said he acted alone. His brother Dante, later pleaded to lesser charges of fourth-degree obstruction.

The older teen was sent to Camden County Youth Correction Facility but was released in September 2013 after he was sentenced to six months in jail and released with time served.
