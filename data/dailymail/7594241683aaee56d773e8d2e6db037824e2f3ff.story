Before: Leanne Johnson pictured as a schoolgirl in a photograph released by her family

For Pamela Johnson, these pictures tell a story of almost unbearable tragedy.

One shows her daughter Leanne as an angelic schoolgirl, smiling and full of hope for the future.

The other shows the college student at 26, near-comatose on her bed after taking crack cocaine and heroin – the drugs that would take her life shortly after.

Despite the harrowing impact of the images, Mrs Johnson, 67, wants them to be published in the hope that charting her daughter’s decline from happy child to hopeless addict will act as a warning to others of the dangers of drugs.

An inquest this week heard how Miss Johnson, a trainee hairdresser, had desperately tried to end her habit and appeared on TV’s Jeremy Kyle Show to talk about her demons.

But despite successfully ‘going clean’ after four months in rehab, she went on a secret drug binge when she returned home to Bolton. It would be her last.

Her sister Melanie Gatis said: ‘She succeeded in kicking her habit and then embarked on a moment of madness which cost her life.

‘If her story saves one person’s life then Leanne has achieved some form of legacy.’

The Bolton inquest was told Miss Johnson came from a respectable family and had held down a number of jobs after studying at college.

But her life began to fall apart when she turned 18 and began a relationship with a man who introduced her to drugs. 

She became addicted to heroin and crack cocaine – at one stage going through six bags of heroin every day and going missing for several weeks at a time.

Another sister Lisa Stevenson told the inquest: ‘She used to just disappear and go and self-destruct but she would eventually come home.’ 

In May last year Miss Johnson contacted ITV’s Jeremy Kyle talk show in a ‘cry for help’ and was later offered a place on a rehab programme in Luton.

At first it was a success and Mrs Johnson said she felt as if ‘I had got my daughter back’.

‘She said she never felt better and had never been happier,’ she added.  

After: Leanne is pictured under the influence of drugs; her family took these photographs to show her in a bid to shock her into changing her behaviour

Tragic: Leanne's family have released a series of old photographs of her  to warn against the dangers of drugs

Horror: These shocking images, also taken by Leanne's family, show how low she sank due to the addiction which eventually killed her

Help: Leanne went on the Jeremy Kyle Show in a bid to get her addiction under control

Weeping: But she vowed to kick drugs after going on the show and was subsequently sent to rehab

Rehab: Leanne's family praised the show's producers for helping her recover from addiction before she relapsed

But Miss Johnson lost her place on a second stint of the rehab when she broke the rules by drinking alcohol. 

Just eight days after returning home in September last year she was dead.

To the bafflement of her family, Miss Johnson had a ‘blip’ and took a fatal overdose.

Sadly, at the time she had been using her mobile phone to download an application form for a hairdressing course.  

Battle: Leanne, pictured left on a night out, struggled with addiction for eight years

Adorable: Leanne grew from a happy-go-lucky little girl into a young woman ravaged by drugs

Verdict: A coroner ruled that Leanne's died from misadventure and issued a warning about drug abuse

Her mother found her body in her bedroom along with drug paraphernalia by her side, including a syringe in an ashtray and a crack pipe in her handbag.

Mrs Gatis, 43, said: ‘Leanne had a last-minute blip and we still don’t know why. We honestly thought we’d got our sister back.’ 

Coroner Alan Walsh recorded a verdict of death by misadventure.
