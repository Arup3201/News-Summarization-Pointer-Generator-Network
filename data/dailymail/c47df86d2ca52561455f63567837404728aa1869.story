The world's longest commercial flight completed its final 9,534mile journey from New Jersey to Singapore this weekend.

Singapore Airlines had been running the grueling near-19 hour flight since 2004, but finally decided to pull the journey from its schedules reportedly because it was becoming too expensive to run.

The route, best known as SQ21, has been taken out of service weeks after a route linking Los Angeles, California, and Singapore was ceased by the airline in October.

No more: Singapore Airlines has decommissioned the world's longest scheduled commercial flight which linked Newark Airport in New Jersey with Changi Airport in Singapore
 

Singapore Airlines, which announced the decision to stop the routes in 2012, says that the decision was made because it is selling its gas-guzzling A340 jets back to Airbus in exchange for new A380s which aren't designed for such long flights.

But reports suggest that the increasing 
cost of fuel has meant that the route, between Newark Airport and Changi
International Airport, is no longer profitable.

Now that the Singapore to New Jersey route has been taken off schedules, what are the top ten longest commercial flights?

According to NJ.com, the price of a barrel of fuel stood at around $28.88 (£17.82) when the route first took off.

But the price of the same amount of fuel has shot up to around $107 (£66) today.

The route, which flew over the Arctic Circle, set travellers back between $6,000 and $8,000 (£3,700 - £4,936) return and was popular with bankers flying between New York and Singapore.

But passengers got business class luxury travel for the price of their ticket.

The planes only seated up to 100 passengers, all in business class, with seats measuring 36 inches wide - twice the width of a standard plane seat.

Each seat had its own 15 inch television screen and a vast film library of 243 titles to choose from, 358 television shows, an 800 CD library, 22 radio stations and 80 video games to keep them occupied on the long journey.

Other airlines operate the same plane with about 250 seats in first, business and economy classes.

The non-stop route saved travellers around three hours when compared to a journey including a stop-off elsewhere.

Instead travellers wishing to go between New Jersey and Singapore will now have to stop at Frankfurt, Germany.

The longest commercial flight available to passengers now is between Sydney, Australia, and Dallas, Texas - a route which is 8,578 miles long and takes around 15 hours and 25 minutes.

Costly trip: The airline found the only way to make the routes profitable was by configuring the plane with 98 business class seats that sell for about $8,000 for a return (file picture)
