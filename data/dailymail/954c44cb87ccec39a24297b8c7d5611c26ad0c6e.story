Harry Potter has cast a spell over young readers after topping a poll to find the nation's favourite children's book.

The boy wizard's first adventure, Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone, received the most votes in the survey by reading charity Booktrust.

Some 24,000 book fans were asked to pick their favourite children's tale from a list of 100 titles, with JK Rowling's worldwide best-seller gaining more than 2,280 votes.

Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone topped a poll of the nation's favourite children's books, seeing off competition from sci-fi series The Hunger Games

Sci-fi adventure The Hunger Games finished second - with 1,193 votes - followed by Roald Dahl's The BFG and The Very Hungry Caterpillar, which topped a poll for readers aged five and under.

Claire Shanahan, Booktrust's head of arts, said: 'As the biggest ever grossing literary franchise, kids and adults alike clearly can't get enough of Harry Potter.

'It's a worldwide phenomena - it has captured the imaginations of a generation of readers who have grown up in love with Harry or Hermione, want to be friends with Ron, and are truly terrified by Voldemort.

'Even when up against heavyweights such as Dahl and Tolkien, Rowling 's creation remains the nation's firm favourite.'

The Very Hungry Caterpillar, which was first published in 1969, featured in the under-five category

Roald Dahl's The BFG was in the top 10, as was the first part of Tolkien's fantasy epic The Lord Of The Rings

Readers of all ages were asked to vote on Booktrust's website for their favourite tale to read before the age of 14.

Other titles making the top 10 included AA Milne's classic Winnie The Pooh, Dr Seuss' The Cat In The Hat, JRR Tolkien's first instalment in the Lord Of The Rings series - The Fellowship Of The Ring, Charlotte's Web, Philip Pullman's novel Northern Lights, and CS Lewis's The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe.

The Harry Potter books have gone to sell more than 450 million copies worldwide after the Philosopher's Stone was first published in 1997.

The series also launched the careers of Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint as the stars of the Hollywood adaptations, which along with video games, memorabilia, and theme park attractions have valued the Harry Potter franchise at 15 billion dollars (Â£9.26 billion), Booktrust said.
