'Despicable': Kizzy Fawcett, 35, stole money from the vulnerable people she was 
supposed to be caring for

A home help stole thousands of pounds from elderly people with memory problems because they would not remember her taking them to the bank to withdraw cash.

Kizzy Fawcett, 35, has been described as 'despicable' for stealing money from the vulnerable people she was supposed to be caring for.

Her victims, who are all in their 70s, say she has just been given a slap on the wrist after she was spared jail.

Detective Constable Rebecca Handley says steps have been taken to ensure Fawcett is no longer allowed access to the elderly through her work.

DC Handley said: 'She targeted elderly victims who had placed their trust in her and she betrayed that trust.

'The victims feel she has just been given a slap on the wrists for what she did.

'For a carer, it was despicable conduct.

'We have contacted the Safeguarding Adults Board to prevent her from working as a carer again to protect the elderly.'

Hull Crown Court heard mother- of-three Fawcett worked for Independent Home Living in Beverley and was sent to the homes of dementia sufferers as a home help.

Despite leaving her job at the firm, she continued to care for her victims and was employed privately.

Over two years, she stole expensive jewellery and more than £12,000 in cash.

Thefts included Rolex watches, a Cameo brooch and an antique watch fob amounting to £6,000.

Fawcett, from Hull, stole cash from one woman’s purse and took some of her victims to the bank to withdraw cash, knowing they would not remember.

The money was spent on phone top-up cards and takeaways.

Prosecutor Nigel Clive said: 'All the victims were elderly and some were suffering from dementia. She admitted targeting such people because of their poor memory.'

Fawcett was caught when Lockings Solicitors was given power of attorney over one woman’s affairs.

They discovered large sums had been withdrawn from her account.

When they investigated further and contacted the bank, Fawcett was seen on CCTV taking the victim to the bank to withdraw funds amounting to more than £6,000 from her account.

Mr Clive said: 'Fawcett told the police she went with the complainant because she knew the woman would never remember going to the bank.

'The money was used to pay for the defendant’s credit card, council tax, takeaways and mobile phone.

'She said she used the money to live on.'

Fawcett stole £150 from the purse of another woman and £375 which had been given to her to purchase a trophy for a junior football team.

When she was arrested, detectives also found cannabis and amphetamines at her home.

She pleaded guilty to 11 thefts and asked the judge to take a further 18 offences of theft into consideration.

Recorder Tony Hawks has sentenced her to a 12-month sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered her to carry out 280 hours of unpaid work in the community.

He said: 'As a carer, either employed by a company or on your own briefly, you abused the trust of vulnerable people and you stole money and other valuable items from them.

'These were despicable offences because these were people who were vulnerable and reaching the end of their lives.

'They were people who were obliged to trust people like you and rely upon them not to defraud or steal from them and you betrayed that trust.'

Recorder Hawks said Fawcett had started abusing drugs.

He said: 'What you were doing that for when you have three young children to care for, I don’t know.

'It is the debt you got into that made you behave in this way.

'You have brought disgrace on yourself and your family.'

Recorder Hawks said many people would say Fawcett deserved to go to prison for her crimes.

He said: 'What saves you from immediate prison is the fact you had the good sense to plead guilty and you didn’t seek to put the blame on others.

'If I send you to prison, your three children will be deprived of their mother and they haven’t done anything wrong and a prison sentence will visit a punishment on them which they do not deserve.

'If you commit any further offences in the next two years you will be brought back to court and the court will consider locking you up.'

Fawcett, who has no previous convictions, was not ordered to pay any compensation to her victims.
