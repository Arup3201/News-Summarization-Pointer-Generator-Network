For almost a century, the pile of dusty old bones lay untouched and unappreciated in a darkened recess of a museum store.

But now, it has emerged from the shadows after scientists realised it belonged to an undiscovered species of deadly prehistoric super-predator – the Blood-biting Tyrant Swimmer.

The creature, which revels in the Latin name of Tyrannoneustes lythrodectikos, would have terrorised the warm Jurassic seas around the British coastline around 165million years ago.

The new research makes it one of the world’s oldest known ‘super-predators’ – carnivores that can feed on prey as large, or larger, than themselves.

The toothy beast, described in the latest issue of the Journal of Systematic Paleontology, was a marine crocodile measuring up to 30ft long that looked part shark and part sinister dolphin.

Its partial skeleton, including a jawbone and teeth, has been stored by the Hunterian Museum at the University of Glasgow ever since it was discovered by an amateur palaeontologist in a clay pit near Peterborough in the early twentieth century.

Its significance was overlooked for years until a team of experts led by the University of Edinburgh examined the creature and identified it as a possible ‘missing link’ between a group of ancient marine crocodiles and modern-day killer whales.

Dr Mark Young, of the University of Edinburgh’s school of geosciences, who led the study, said: ‘It is satisfying to be able to classify a specimen that has been unexamined for more than 100 years, and doubly so to find that this discovery improves our understanding of the evolution of marine reptiles.’

He said that, at the time the creature lived, much of Europe was covered by a shallow sea, creating a chain of differently sized islands. Tyrannoneustes lived in this shallow sea, along with numerous other marine reptiles, including pliosaurs, plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs.

Dr Young added: ‘Giant pliosaurs were even larger than the Tyrant Swimmer, so they might have feasted on the formidable species.

‘As its name suggests, however, Tyrant Swimmer would have been swift in the water, so it likely could have out-swam possible predators and used the swimming prowess to capture its own prey.’

He indicated that Tyrant Swimmer most likely evolved into an even more stealthy marine predator with very large and numerous teeth and a mouth that could open extremely wide.

Dr Neil Clark, palaeontology curator at The Hunterian, said: ‘Little research has been done on this specimen since it was first listed in 1919. It is comforting to know that new species can still be found in museums as new research is carried out on old collections.

‘It is not just the new species that are important, but an increase in our understanding of how life evolved and the variety of life forms that existed 163million years ago in the warm Jurassic seas around what is now Britain.’
