Jason Lucas Revis, 33, of Oveido, Florida, was found guilty of molesting a 10-year-old girl

A US Army staff sergeant has been found guilty of molesting a 10-year-old girl, whose mother stabbed him when she witnessed the abuse.

Jason Lucas Revis, 33, of Oveido, Florida, was convicted of of lewd and lascivious molestation, after he made the girl touch him inappropriately in September 2011. 

Jurors deliberated for less than four hours before finding Revis guilty last night.

He is set to be sentenced on Monday.

The court heard Revis was stabbed three times in the arm by the victim's mother after she walked in on him molesting her daughter.

But Assistant State Attorney Dave Whateley said the defendant never sought any treatment for his injuries.

He also convinced the victim and her mother to keep the incident quiet for more than two years.

But Revis was arrested in February after the child confided in a friend and the child's mother notified authorities.

The victim's mother told jurors in Spanish that she stabbed Revis 'once or twice', reported the Orlando Sentinel.

She said: 'I thought since I was defending my daughter, I would not get in trouble.'

She explained did not report the abuse when it occurred because her daughter refused to talk about it.

The girl, now 13, told the court that the defendant had called her into his bedroom in September 2011 - but she was not sure on what day.

She said he had told her to touch him in an inappropriate manner - and she did what he asked.

But defense attorney Tony Dodds suggested that she had made up the story and asked if she had reported the incident to anyone in the two years after she said it happened.

He asked: 'It never happened, did it?' Dodds asked.

She replied: 'It did happen.'

The girl added that her mother had then walked in on them and witnessed what was going on.
