A cheeky goose with a thirst for cider has become a popular regular at his local pub.

Jack, from Market Drayton, Shropshire, regularly waddles into the Crown Pub and has become a firm favourite with the other drinkers.

The sight of geese being driven through a village street was once a familiar sight in the British countryside, but now the landlord gives the friendly fowl free range of the pub.

Neck it: Pub landlord Rob Andrews serves Jack the goose a pint of his favourite cider. The friendly fowl is owned by Sally Barnett

Sally Barnett and Keith Burgess are Jack's owners and even serve him a drink on his very own beer towel. His visits have made him a local celebrity and he now boasts more than 1,300 friends on Facebook.

Ms Barnett, 41, said: 'We take Jack almost everywhere with us, so we didn't even think twice about taking him to the pub with us too.

'The first time we went to the pub, we asked if we could leave him in the beer garden, but as it started to get a bit colder, the landlady suggested we bring him inside - and it's stayed that way ever since.

Gulping goose: Jack is well-loved by the other bar patrons and wanders around 'chatting to them'

'He's really sociable and loves "chatting away" to everyone, he's become part of the furniture down there now.'

It's not just at the pub where his fans can spot him - Jack's also been known to show up at the town's weekly markets and even goes on camping trips with his owners.

Ms Barnett said: 'Jack is as much a part of our family as a dog would be. As a baby he used to sleep on our bed and he eats in the kitchen with us.

'He has a lead and we take him everywhere we can. He'll nip to the supermarket and wait outside while we do the shop - he always attracts a lot of attention.

'We feel like his parents, so we like to have him with us as much as possible.'

The couple decided to adopt a goose after looking after a gosling for their friend.

Ms Barnett said: 'We'd been looking after a baby goose for one of our friends, and really suddenly it died.'

She added: ''We were both absolutely devastated and realised that it might be nice to get a gosling of our own.

'I researched on the internet and a farm not far from us had some geese to sell so I went down to have a look.

'I was initially given a white goose but a grey one, which turned out to be Jack, caught my eye so I asked for him instead.

'We connected straight away and he didn't stop chatting to me for the whole car journey home. He's been a huge part of our lives ever since.'

Since Jack was first brought home, he has been treated to a life of luxury by his owners.

'When we first got him we left him outside but he'd just honk and honk so we brought him into the house,' Ms Barnett said.

'As soon as he was in the house, he was much calmer - and quieter.

'He used to have a wash in our bath, but now that he's bigger he has his own paddling pool that he uses.

'He eats out of a china bowl in the kitchen - although he's forever stealing food that we leave out. I caught him with a bread roll the other day.'

And Jack has even found love in fellow goose, Jill, also owned by Sally and Keith.
