Guilty: Robert Cordingley, 57, who was his father's sole carer, had previously been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome

An Asperger's syndrome sufferer who smothered his 91-year-old father to death before calmly feeding his cat then taking a shower has been jailed for life.

Robert Cordingley, 57, from Bradford, admitted to murdering his father, George, in January by covering his face with a pillow wrapped in a bin liner.

He then wandered to a police station to confess his crime but found it closed and went to a supermarket car park to find a uniformed officer.

Cordingly's father, a widower who had been a well-known motorbike competitor, was found dead in a bedroom of the house he had shared with his son for 57 years.

Cordingley, who was his father’s sole carer, had previously been diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome, a form of autism.

Newcastle Crown Court heard that after killing his father he fed his cat and had a shower.

The court also heard that there was evidence that suggested his father had begun to suffer from dementia.

Mr Justice McCombe said: 'This is a very tragic and unusual case.

'The deceased was 91-years-old when he died and he had lived with the defendant for his whole life.

'There is evidence that he began to suffer from dementia but no help was sought.

'The defendant cared for his father by writing him notes to tell him where his food was and helped him prepare for the day.

'But a growing frustration was present with the defendant which led him to taking the decision to end his father’s life.'

Carpark confession: Newcastle Crown Court heard that Cordingley then went to a police station to confess, but it was closed, so he approached police officers in a supermarket car park and told them he had murdered his father

The court heard that Cordingley’s condition led to poor judgment in finding a solution to his situation.

Detective Inspector Steve Snow, of West Yorkshire Police, said: 'It is hard to imagine what must have been going through Robert Cordingley’s mind when he ultimately decided to end his own father’s life.

'The evidence suggested that this was not a sophisticated plan, but one seemingly prompted out of desperation.

'A thorough and professional investigation was undertaken which clearly presented the facts and culminated in a guilty plea.

'Cordingley will now have to reflect on his decision, not only to take another life, but to subsequently ruin his own.'
