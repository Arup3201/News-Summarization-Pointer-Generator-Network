The enclosed checks also included the notation, 'Dinner out.'

Smith coached an estimated 184 players from 1961 to 1997, reports SI.com.

A host of sporting legends - led by Michael Jordan - paid tribute to Smith after he passed away on February 7. 

Jordan  described Smith, who was the former basketball coach for the University of North Carolina as 'a second father.' 

He said: 'Other than my parents, no one had a bigger influence on my life than Coach Smith.'

Smith, who died peacefully at his home, left behind his wife and five children.

Jordan, played under Smith from 1982 to 1984 before embarking on his legendary NBA career.

In a moving statement Jordan added: 'He was more than a coach - he was my mentor, my teacher, my second father.'

He said: 'He was the greatest there ever was on the court, but far, far, better off the court with people.'

'I'd like to say on behalf of all our players and coaches, past and present, that Dean Smith was the perfect picture of what a college basketball coach should have been. We love him and we will miss him,' Williams added.
