It's the house where Gerard Baden-Clay murdered his wife and dragged her body through autumn leaves to the carport.

Then he drove Allison Baden-Clay away from her family home and her sleeping daughters for the last time.

It is a house which has become eerily familiar to millions of Australians, who followed weeks of evidence in the Baden-Clay murder trial, the site from which screams and thuds were heard on the night Allison Baden-Clay disappeared.

Scene of the crime: Is this the spot where Gerard Baden-Clay murdered wife Allison? The outdoor patio of 593 Brookfield Road, Brookfield (photographed four months after the murder) has been suggested as the actual murder scene, after evidence was given the couple's three sleeping daughters inside the house heard no noises, neighbours did hear screams, thuds and an argument, and Allison's body was found with six plant specimens common to the back yard of the home

Spooked: Harcourts real estate agency in the western Brisbane suburb of Kenmore advertised the Baden-Clay residence as a 'must inspect' property in the months after the murder took place, but prospective residents were either unimpressed by the home's dejected air, or spooked by the fact a woman had been murdered by her husband inside it

The house where Allison Baden-Clay was killed had four bedrooms and two bathrooms, but failed to rent when this picture was advertised in 2012 a few months after it was vacated when Gerard Baden-Clay was jailed to await trial. The property's owners installed a caretaker and now plan to build another dwelling on the one hectare site to extend their adjacent child care business

It's the place where Ms Baden-Clay inflicted the telltale scratches on her husband as he probably smothered her, with the back yard where leaves unique to the property became entangled in her hair and clothing.

It was as if the house itself was giving evidence during the five week murder trial, with its plant specimens, its neatness after the murderer tidied up, the position of parked family cars and the placement of the killer's mobile phone charger all telling points in the prosecution case.

But 593 Brookfield Road, Brookfield in Brisbane's west is also the house where no-one wants to live, barring a caretaker and administration staff for the child care centre which occupies the same address.

Owners Mosman Services Pty Ltd first put the house back on the market in August 2012, four months after Allison had disappeared and 10 weeks after Gerard Baden-Clay was charged with her murder.

The four-bedroom, two bathroom home with its dated pink and peach decor was available for a weekly rent of $460.

But as photographs of the house show, its bare, stained rooms either failed to excite or its bloody past spooked potential renters.

Grisly history: It was the home where the marriage of Allison and Gerard Baden-Clay (pictured, left, on their wedding day in 1997) finally unravelled in a bloody struggle which resulted in her death, but not before she had clawed his face (right) as she fought him to her death. Now the home has failed to attract renters and is occupied by the caretaker of an adjacent child care centre

If the walls could speak: As if the house itself was giving testimony during the Baden-Clay murder trial, certain aspects spoke volumes to investigating detectives who fund the kitchen (pictured) had been wiped clean and the bathroom had no trace of the killer's purported shaving accident. Growing in the backyard were plant specimens a botanist would link to leaf litter found on Allison Baden-Clay's body

Screams, plants and blood: evidence given during the Baden-Clay trial which compelled the jury into convicting Gerard of the murder of his wife Allison were that screams came from the house (pictured), leaf specimens came from the back yard and Allison's blood was found in her Holden Captiva which was parked in the car port

Scuffle on the patio: Recreated by Channel Nine's 60 Minutes programme, the scuffle which ended Allison's life was depicted as happening in the back yard of the Baden-Clay home, after which she was taken to a creek bed 14km away. the house has failed to rent since 

After the house failed to rent, owners of the large one hectare block, on which there is the Brookfield Early Childhood Centre, made a development application (DA) to extend the childcare facilities.

The DA approved by Brisbane City Council notes the house where Allison was murdered as merely 'existing caretaker's dwelling'. The car port where police photographs showed Allison's Holden Captiva - the vehicle Gerard Baden-Clay used to transport his wife's body to Kholo Creek - is slated as 'proposed car parks'.

When Daily Mail Australia visited the site, the car par was full of cars and desks with computers were set up inside the former Baden-Clay family home with administration staff for the child care centre busy and working.

The approved DA shows plans for a new building to boost the capacity of the facility from 75 to 123 children.

In 2012, four months after Allison's murder, the Kenmore branch of Harcourts real estate had listed the home as a 'must inspect' property, with open-plan living and an entertainment patio.

It was across the home's back patio that viewers of Nine Network's 60 Minutes programme on Sunday about the Baden-Clay case watched the recreation by the of Gerard Baden-Clay dragging his wife's body.

Photographs of the house taken just months after the murder show leaves scattered on the pavers.

Compelling testimony during trial which gripped the public and helped convince a Brisbane Supreme Court jury of the accused's guilt involved six botanic specimens.

Real estate ethics expert Neil Jenman says the Baden-Clay house (pictured, in property photos fur months after the murder) may have failed to rent because nobody knows in what room the murder actually took place

It's not the faded 1980s pink and peach decor of the Baden-Clay home (pictured) which put people off, but what went on there. Not only did Gerard Baden-Clay kill his wife while his children were sleeping in the house, he subjected her to years of emotional abuse within its walls

A police photograph taken just four days after Allison Baden-Clay's murder shows the same house with the family's belongings strewn about. Four months on, with the house emptied of all trace of the tragic family, real estate agency Harcourts could attract no renters and now tow years later, the property owners are extending a child care centre on the site

Cat's claw, eucalyptus, crepe myrtle, chinese elm, lilli pilli and fishbone fern were found both on Allison's body and growing in the back yard of 593 Brookfield Road, Brookfield. Samples of the specimens (pictured) were used as compelling evidence to convict Gerard Baden-Clay

Cat's claw, eucalyptus, crepe myrtle, chinese elm, lilli pilli and fishbone fern were found both on Allison's body and growing in the back yard.

Another factor in the trial was lack of blood in the bathroom to support Gerard Baden-Clay's claims he had cut himself shaving, and an overly tidy house - police suspected he had cleaned up.

Evidence included the fact police could detect Baden-Clay had plugged his mobile phone into its charger at 1.38am, when he claimed to be in a heavy sleep.

The placement of the power point on his side of the bed, when he claimed he had relinquished his phone to Allison, as well as the layout of the house were factors in the trial.

The Sydney houses where Sef Gonzales murdered his parents and sister in 2001 and where five members of the Lin family were slain in 2009 have both sold, albeit at reduced prices, but the Baden-Clay 'murder house' (pictured) has failed to attract anyone interested in renting despite it being advertised two years ago for $460 a week.

Haunted house: the property 593 Brookfield Road, Brookfield is in a prestige area of western Brisbane but when it was offered for rental, no family was interested. It is now being developed and a caretake lives in the house

'Murder houses" or homes where significant crimes have taken place are required to be advertised with full disclosure of the grisly event, which brings the price down but does not preclude a sale.

The Sydney house in which Sef Gonzales murdered his parents and sister in 2001, sold in 2005 for $720,000 after the owners tried to offload it for $800,000 without disclosing its past

The house in the north-western Sydney suburb of North Epping, in which five members of the Lin family were slain in 2009, was sold after remaining empty for three years following the murders.

Real estate ethics expert, Neil Jenman, was the property agent who blew the whistle on the attempted sale without disclosure of the Gonzales family house.

Mr Jenman said the Baden-Clay family house may not have rented because an agent could not specifically point out the room where the crime took place.

Mr Jenman told Daily Mail Australia families seeking to rent the Baden-Clay house would be 'spooked' by not knowing exactly what went on in the house.

'Only Gerard Baden-Clay knows what he did in that house,' Mr Jenman said.

'Anyone going into the house would have to think "where did he do it?".

'It is such a creepy thing.

'A lot of people are quite religious or superstitious and one of the things they do when they buy a house is get a priest in to bless it.

'Generally speaking if a gruesome murder has gone on it takes about ten per cent off the price.

'But if there's a bit of a mystery,  well it spooks people.'

Mr Jenman said after his intervention in the Sef Gonzales house sale, potential buyers knew all the gory details about where Gonzales had committed his murders in the house, and that the family home had sold.
