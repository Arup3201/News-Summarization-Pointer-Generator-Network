Daughter Ramela, 14, pictured with Richard, 15, was also killed in the accident as the family travelled to Albania

It is believed the family, from Barking, east London, were travelling to see family in Albania when the accident happened on a coastal road. 

Witnesses said the  car struck a verge at the side of the road and bounced into the path of a truck coming in the opposite direction.

The truck was apparently a vehicle used by the country's road maintenance organisation. The driver of the Croatian truck was not harmed in the crash.

Neighbours of the Isufis told London's Evening Standard they are a 'lovely family' who always went on holiday together in the car.

The crash happened on the Adriatic coast road on the way to Dubrovnik and the family were travelling in a BMW 3 series.

Mrs Isufi and son Clive were in an intensive care ward at City Hospital in Dubrovnik this morning. It is believe she is in a coma while the youngster is suffering from chest injuries.

The director of the hospital, Jerko Ferri Certic, said yesterday that the situation was 'very difficult' and doctors were still fighting to save their lives.

He said: 'The mother had internal bleeding and a liver injury and we needed to do an urgent operation. The boy had serious injuries to his chest.'

Toys belonging to the children could be seen spilling out of the BMW's boot at the crash scene yesterday.

A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: 'We are aware of an incident in Dubrovnik, Croatia and we are in contact with the local authorities.

'We stand ready to provide consulate assistance.'

The accident involving the family's BMW happened on a coastal road in Croatia yesterday afternoon

It is thought the car hit a verge before swerving in front of a truck, whose driver was not injured in the crash

The road is a key route for tourists heading to their holidays on the Croatian coastline
