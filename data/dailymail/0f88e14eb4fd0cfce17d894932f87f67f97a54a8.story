A Colorado mother accused in the heat stroke deaths of her two young children has been offered a plea deal, even though the victims’ relatives want to see the woman executed.

Heather Jensen appeared in court Wednesday with a fresh perm and a smile on her face, waiving her right to a preliminary hearing so that she could consider a plea agreement offer put to her by the prosecution.

The 25-year-old Palisade woman is charged with child abuse resulting in death, criminally negligent homicide and false reporting to authorities.

Weigh in her options: Heather Jensen, 25, waived her right to a preliminary hearing, signaling to the prosecution that she may be interested in a plea deal

Serious charges: Jensen was arrested in January for allegedly causing the deaths of her toddler sons in November by leaving them in an overheated SUV for 90 minutes while she had sex in a truck

Tragedy: Two-year-old William (left) died on November 27 in Colorado while his four-year-old brother Tyler (right) died a week later in hospital. The two had been left by their mother in an SUV with the engine running for 90 minutes

The charges stem for a tragic November
incident in which Jensen allegedly left her two sons, 2-year-old 
William and 4-year-old Tyler, locked in a car with the heat running for 
more than an hour while she took drugs and had sex with a man in a truck
nearby

The younger of the two boys died of hyperthermia at the scene, while his older brother passed away at a hospital a week later.

Call for justice: The victims' grandfather, Robert Mathena, said the family would have liked to see Jensen executed

Under a possible plea deal, the 
details of which were not made public during the Wednesday hearing, 
Jensen's charges could be reduced to two counts of criminally negligent 
homicide carrying a sentence of 12 to 24 years in prison, according to 
the boys' grandparents.

'They [the prosecutor and an 
investigator] asked us what we would like to see done. Of course, we 
said, "The electric chair,"' the victims' step-grandfather, Robert 
Mathena, told The Denver Post. 'But we would like to see this come to an end.'

The death penalty is not an option for the 25-year-old Jensen based on her current charges.  

Mathena and his wife, Diane, have spent more than two months fighting the mother in court over the fate of her sons' remains.

Tyler and Willem died just six week after the Mathenas' son and Jensen's husband, Eric, was killed in a car crash.

The woman was planning to have her 
boys cremated, but their grandparents won the right to lay them to rest 
next to their father in Palisade. The toddlers were finally buried in 
February, nearly four months after their deaths.

Robert Mathena told CBS Denver he was outraged to
find a letter penned by Jensen in prison that was attached to the 
heart-shaped headstone erected on the grave for the two boys and their 
dad.

Letter from prison: The dead boys' grandparents were shocked to discover a note from Jensen attached to their headstone stating that she was sorry, and that she was a 'good mommy' to them

The 25-year-old woman has been in 
jail on a $150,000 bond since her arrest last winter, but the Mathenas 
believe she had sent her letter to a friend who then brought it to the 
cemetery.

In her missive, Jensen wrote that she 
was sorry, called her sons' deaths an accident and described herself as a
'good mommy' who always tried to keep her kids from harm.

The letter was supplemented by a birthday card for William, who would have turned three years old last Friday.

Jensen is scheduled to be arraigned 
May 30, at which time the details of the plea deal could be revealed, 
should she choose to accept it. 

Speaking to CBS Denver, Robert Denver 
said that he is tired of Jensen 'playing her little games' and wants her
out of their lives forever.

But in an interview with The Daily 
Sentinel, the grandfather pointed out that seeing the 25-year-old woman 
walk away with three or four years of probation would not be acceptable 
to the family.

Widowed: Heather Jensen, 24, lost her 26-year-old husband Eric in a car accident last year

Devastating loss: The young mother lost both her sons in the tragic accident last year

Deadly: Heather Jensen dialed 911 on November 27 when she realized that her youngest son was not breathing in the back seat

'I'd like to see her do some serious time,' he concluded.

Law enforcement officials say the Palisade woman left her sons on November 27, 2012, in a parked SUV for 90 minutes 
while she met up with a male friend in a car sitting next to her own.

Mrs Jensen called 911 that night to say 
two-year-old William was not breathing and had no pulse from the car 
park close to Powderhorn Mountain ski resort in Grand Junction, 
Colorado.  

She also told dispatchers at around 7pm that four-year-old Tyler was barely breathing.

William died at the scene while Tyler was airlifted to Aurora's children's hospital but passed away a week later.

Both children died from hyperthermia, according to the autopsy by Mesa County coroner. Hyperthermia is a condition which causes extreme overheating in the body.

Mrs Jensen told investigators that 
she had gone to meet a male friend on November 27 when the tragedy took 
place.

Deaths: Mr Jensen was killed in October when his car was hit head-on by an SUV. His sons William and Tyler also died in a vehicle-related death

She initially told deputies that she 
left her sons in the car for 10 minutes to talk to a friend but later 
admitted that it had been much longer.

Heather
Jensen was widowed after her 26-year-old husband, Eric, was killed when
his car was hit head-on by an SUV on October 10. The other driver 
suffered minor injuries.

According to the Daily Sentinel, she let the boys play in the snow on November 27 before putting them back in her Toyota 4Runner and turning the engine on.

She then sat in the man's truck for around an hour and a half, police investigators said.

The
25-year-old, who has a history of taking anti-depressants, was on 
probation for a domestic violence assault against her late husband 
earlier this year.
