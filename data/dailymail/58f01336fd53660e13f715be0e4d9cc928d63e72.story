A woman who was told she could never have children finally had a baby after her big sister gave birth to her son.

Susan Hughes, who was born without a uterus, was devastated when she discovered aged just 16 that she would never be able to carry her own children.

But big sister Sarah Wheeler promised she would do 'everything in her power' to make Susan a mother.

And just 15 months ago, Sarah, now 38, gave birth to her nephew Dougie with Susan the first person to hold her newborn son. 

Susan, 33, and her husband Mike, 36, said they were ecstatic to finally be able to complete their family and would be forever grateful for her sister's precious gift. 

'Big sisters are supposed to look after their younger siblings, but mine went above and beyond,' said the new mother, from Swadlincote, Derbyshire.

'She made all my dreams come true and is the best aunty in the world to Dougie.'

Susan was diagnosed with Mayer Rokitansky Kuster Hauser (MRKH) syndrome as a teenager - a condition that affects the reproduction system and meant she didn't have a uterus

Mother-of-three Sarah added: 'I said I would carry Susan's baby straight away, without even speaking to my husband, it was always at the back of my mind and I knew eventually the time would come.

'I always keep my promises, I had no intention of ever breaking it. It wasn't hard handing him over after the birth, I never thought of Dougie as mine, I was just the oven. We have a special aunty nephew bond though.' 

Susan was diagnosed with Mayer Rokitansky Kuster Hauser (MRKH) syndrome as a teenager - a condition that affects the reproduction system and meant she didn't have a uterus.

'It was devastating,' she said. 'I'd always dreamed of being a mother and carrying my own child. To be told that I'd never be able to have children naturally was shattering.'

Later that day she went home and cried to her sister, Sarah, who made her the ultimate promise.

Susan, from Swadlincote, Derbyshire, said her sister had gone 'above and beyond' to make her wish of motherhood become true

'She took my hand and made a pact with me,' explained Susan, an office manager.

'She told me that when they day came and, I wanted children, she would carry them for me.'

Eight years ago Susan started dating friend Mike, a mechanic, who knew she couldn't have children.

After three years, the couple started to discuss their options and Susan told Mike about her pact with her sister Sarah, a catering assistant.

And despite being a proud mother to Megan, 15, Ethan, 11, and Finlay, six, she vowed to stick to her promise without even asking husband Mark, 40, a maintenance man.

With no NHS support available, Susan and Mike ploughed £10,000 of savings into fertility treatment.

All the money and effort was worthwhile after Sarah finally gave birth to her nephew Dougie in November 2013, weighing 9lb 2

After two failed attempts at a private clinic  in Nottingham, the family finally struck it lucky with attempt number three and in February 2013- 17 years after her original promise- Sarah called to give her sister the good news.

Susan said: 'Sarah called me and told me I was going to be a mum.

'I burst into tears. It was the best moment of my life.'

Throughout Sarah's pregnancy, Susan attended every hospital appointment and antenatal class with her and little Dougie was born in November 2013, weighing 9lb 2.

'I was the first one to hold him,' said Susan. 'Words can't describe the overwhelming love I felt for him when I cradled him in my arms.

'He had no idea how much we'd been through to have him. 'Taking Dougie home from the hospital was amazing. 'He was everything we had ever dreamed of, and I love being a mum.

'I'm so happy to have a perfect family, and it's all thanks to my big sis.'
