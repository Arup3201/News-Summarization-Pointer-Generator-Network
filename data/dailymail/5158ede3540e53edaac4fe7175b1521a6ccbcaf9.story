She was left blind in one eye and severely disabled after crashing her car while texting at the wheel.

Now, Liz Marks has revealed the loneliness she feels in the wake of the incident in April 2012.

The 20-year-old was driving her Mazda 3 along a road in St Michaels, Maryland, when she received a text from her mother, Betty. Without thinking, she looked down at her phone to read the message.

Seconds later, she crashed into a tow truck driven by 25-year-old Roy Dixon that was stopped on St Michaels Road waiting to turn left on to Wales Lane. The truck had its left signal turned on.

Feeling alone: Miss Marks (pictured, center, with two friends in 2012) revealed one of the worst consequences of the crash was the loss of her friends. 'I just remember  thinking to myself, "I have no-one",' she said

Miss Marks, then aged 17, was airlifted to the University of Baltimore Shock Trauma Center with serious brain and facial injuries, where she remained in intensive care for nearly a month.

In subsequent weeks, she was forced to undergo a number of surgeries, including an 11-hour procedure on her brain, according to The Star Democrat in Maryland. 

Two-and-a-half years on, she remains blind in one eye, has lost her sense of smell, cannot hear properly, is unable to create tears due to damaged tear ducts and cannot fall asleep naturally.

But despite her shocking injuries, Miss Marks revealed one of the most devastating consequences of the crash was the loss of her friends, many of whom couldn't deal with her situation.

'The hardest part about my life after the car accident was the fact that I was alone,' Miss Marks said in a video pleading with drivers not to text and drive.

'Everyone was away at college, I wasn't. My friends were there for me at first, but after a while they weren't. I just remember sitting at home, thinking to myself, "I have no-one".'

Before the crash, the former student at St. Michaels High School was a 'popular' teenager who went to high school parties, sports games, bowling with friends and even did some modelling.

But after the incident, she felt so lonely that she was driven to begging for friends on Facebook.

Wiping away tears, her mother, Betty, said: 'I looked up on her Facebook page and she said, "can anybody please hang out with me today? I don't have any friends".'

She added: 'My main worry for Liz as a parent before she started driving was the typical teenage things, the drugs, the alcohol, being safe and hanging around the right sort of kids.
