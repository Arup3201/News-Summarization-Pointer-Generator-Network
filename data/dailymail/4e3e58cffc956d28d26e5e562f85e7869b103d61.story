Authorities in Florida are on the hunt for a 33-year-old man who they say went on a rampage killing his wife and two other people, including a pastor. 

Police on Thursday were searching for Andres 'Andy' Avalos. The Manatee County sheriff's office said he killed Pastor James 'Tripp' Battle, 31, at the Bayshore Baptist Church.

A witness to the shooting told deputies at the scene about the other two victims, said sheriff's spokesman Dave Bristow.

Slain: Pastor James 'Tripp' Battle, 31, was found dead inside his Bradenton, Florida, church. Pictured here is the clergyman's family: wife Joy and their two young children 

'We don't know exactly what transpired,' Bristow said.

Investigators went to the couple's house at 1200 67th Street Northwest in Bradenton and found the bodies of 33-year-old Amber Avalos, the suspect's wife of 14 years, and a neighbor, 46-year-old Denise Potter.

Investigators believe Andy Avalos first killed the two women at home and then drove across town to the church at around 1pm to kill the pastor.

Manatee County deputies responded to the church on 14th Street West around 1:20pm, where they discovered James Battle's body. 

At the church, deputies 'learned of the possibility of other victim(s),' the Manatee County Sheriff's Office said.

Amber Avalos worked at the church as its nursery and children's director. The Avaloses have six children and Bristow said they are in the custody of a relative.

Detectives say Mr Avalos was last seen near the church driving a gold-colored 2003 Chevrolet Suburban with 484VTZ plates in Bradenton. He is considered armed and dangerous. 

'We don't know if whether or not he is still alive,' Bristow said. 'We presume he is.'

The Bayshore Baptist website said that Andy Avalos' father also is a minister. It says Battle and his wife of seven years, Joy, who is the church's secretary, have a 5-year-old daughter, Sophie, and a 2-year-old son, Joshua.

'We have to be strong for Joy,' church member Linda Stewart was quoted by the Bradenton Herald as saying. 'I don't know how she will get through this.'

E.W 'Karp' Carpenter, a member of the church since the 1950s, told the newspaper that Battle 'was a great pastor,' and that the church's congregation grew from 30 to more than 100 under his stewardship.

'He was 31 years old and would give you shirt off his back,' Carpenter said. 'It will take me days to get over this. He was in the prime of his life.'

The newspaper quoted Sheriff Brad Steube as saying that Battle and Avalos met face-to-face in the church courtyard shortly before the shooting.

'The pastor saw this coming,' he said.

Shooting: A body was found at Bayshore Baptist Church in Bradenton on Thursday afternoon 

Jane Riley, a neighbor of the Avalos family, told The Associated Press that the neighborhood near the Manatee River is 'like the sweetest little community,' although she did point out that in 2008, a previous tenant of the Avaloses' home was slain during a home invasion.

'Now I'm scared,' said Riley. 'I have an alarm system, but is that enough? I hope the cops hang around for a while.' 

Five local schools - Manatee High School, King Middle Schoo, Miller Elementary School and Palma Sola Elementary School - were placed on lockdown in response to the shooting, but the lockdowns were lifted at 3.45pm, WFLA reported.
