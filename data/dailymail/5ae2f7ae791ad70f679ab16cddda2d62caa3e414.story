High streets were given a helping hand yesterday as George Osborne (pictured) announced a ‘wide-ranging review’ into crippling business rates

High streets were given a helping hand yesterday as George Osborne announced a ‘wide-ranging review’ into crippling business rates.

Introduced in Elizabethan times, the tax is accused of pushing independent shops out of business by charging punishingly high rates.

High street retailers claim it places them at a disadvantage to online rivals because it is only charged on ‘bricks and mortar’.

Business rates are forecast to raise £22.4billion in England in 2014-15, from 1.8million non-domestic properties.

But the Chancellor announced a review into the controversial levy, saying ‘you cannot create jobs without successful businesses’.

‘In my opinion, the current system of business rates has not kept pace with the needs of a modern economy and changes to our town centres,’ he said. ‘It needs far-reaching reform.’

Business rates are currently calculated according to the rental value of the property a company uses. But this is based on prices from 2008, the height of the property boom, which do not take into account the effect of the recession.

The system also means some small shops on busy high streets pay very high rates, while online giants such as Amazon, with large warehouses in cheaper locations, pay less.

Tax expert Richard Rose, of BDO accountants, said the review launch was ‘welcome but long overdue’, adding that ‘any benefits of change are unlikely to filter through until well into the next Parliament’.

‘It will, therefore, be a watching brief for some time yet, which will offer little respite for mid-market retailers who continue to feel the pain of rates set in 2008.’

'Now the Budget's out of the way we can focus on serious issues like who's going to host top gear'

Jules Winstanley, 51, who will pay £15,000 in business rates for her two clothing boutiques, in Bath and Teddington, south-west London, urged the review to radically reduce rates for small businesses.

‘We need a resurgence of help for independent shops so that we can compete fairly with the big boys,’ she added. 

‘It is so expensive to have bricks and mortar and, if we don’t protect them … we will lose that service and face-to-face contact that you will never get online.’

Rain Newton-Smith, of the Confederation of British Industry, said the smallest businesses should be removed from the rates. The review began on Monday and retailers and organisations will be invited to give their opinions.

But shops hoping for a large tax cut could be disappointed, as ministers have already warned any changes are likely to be ‘fiscally neutral’, meaning the Treasury would still generate the same amount of tax. Joanna Elson, of the Money Advice Trust said it was ‘crucial’ that the review considers how the rates system can ‘better support small business owners who are struggling’.

Last year, MPs on the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee suggested the business rates system should be ‘based on sales rather than the rateable value of a property’.

A raft of measures were unveiled to appeal to young workers.

The national minimum wage will increase by 20p an hour to £6.70 from October. This represents the largest increase, when adjusted for inflation, in almost ten years.

The hourly rate for apprentices will also go up by a record 57p to £3.30 an hour. This will result in an annual salary rise of over £1,000 for a full-time apprentice and benefit 67,000 young people.

The Government said this would ensure that ‘those undertaking this important type of training are rewarded’.

Employers’ National Insurance contributions will also be abolished for under-21s from next month, and for young apprentices from April 2016. This will encourage more businesses to hire young workers. Budget documents revealed that more than two million people have started apprenticeships under the current Government.

In the last year, the highest ever number of students from disadvantaged backgrounds also applied to, and were accepted into, university. George Osborne promised income-contingent loans of up to £25,000 for UK students studying for PhDs and research-based master’s degrees.

Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of The Sutton Trust, said: ‘The plans should improve the chances of low and middle income graduates taking on research master’s and doctoral courses which have become the preserve of better off students.’

Helen Dickinson, of the British Retail Consortium welcomed the boost for young workers. She said: ‘Over one million of the three million people who work in retail are under 24.

‘The abolition of national insurance contributions for under-21s will allow retailers of all sizes to create new job opportunities.

‘The industry also employs almost 20 per cent of the UK’s apprentices and abolishing national insurance contributions will make it easier and more cost-effective to employ and train them.’

Charlotte Balbier, 34, (pictured above) is a wedding dress designer who pays £28,000 in business rates per year.

She welcomed the Government’s review of the rates, which she said should be lowered to keep small businesses thriving.

The designer, of Heald Green, near Stockport, started her business in 2003 and stocks 40 shops across Europe. 

She has seen business rates rise steadily.

The rates affect her own showroom, which occupies two floors of an office block, but also the shops on the high street which she relies upon to stock her dresses.

‘I would like to see lower business rates and less red tape,’ she said.

 ‘We supply 350 stores … and they are the shops on the high street who could really stand to benefit from a reduction in rates.’

 £143-a-year tax break for 4.6million who work for themselves

The self-employed were given a £143-a-year tax break yesterday.

The Chancellor announced the Government would axe a £2.75-a-week national insurance contribution (NIC) ‘in the next Parliament’, for the 4.6million who work for themselves.

But it emerged the tax break could be a sweetener before a huge shake-up of NI, which funds benefits such as the State pension and maternity leave.

The small print of the Budget revealed ministers were planning a ‘contributory benefit test’ – suggesting the self-employed may soon have to pay more for benefits such as the State pension.

They usually pay two types of NIC – class 2, a weekly charge if profits are more than £5,885 a year, and class 4, an annual charge if profits are over £7,956.

Mr Osborne made no mention of the new ‘test’ in his speech, saying only that he would be scrapping the unpopular class 2 NIC.

The self-employed will continue to pay class 4, which is charged at either 2 or 9 per cent of profits depending on earnings.

The class 2 tax, while not enormous, was seen as an administrative burden to pay weekly.

Joanna Elson, of the Money Advice Trust, said: ‘The scrapping of class 2 NICs will provide welcome relief for the self-employed, at least in the short term.

‘What this means for their level of pension and welfare entitlement in the long-term, however, needs to be examined.’

The self-employed traditionally pay less national insurance because they receive less in benefits, including the second State pension, sick pay and holiday pay.

But, from April 2015, everyone will receive a flat-rate State pension irrelevant of contributions – which could put the self-employed at an unfair advantage.

Ros Altmann, the Government’s older workers adviser, said yesterday: ‘It is possible the Government could off-set the tax break by asking [the self-employed] to contribute more towards the flat-rate State pension.’
