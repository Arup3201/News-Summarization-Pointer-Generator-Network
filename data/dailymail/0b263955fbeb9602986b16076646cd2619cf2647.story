A baby bottle that heats milk as it is being drunk has sparked a huge amount of interest on parenting forums – but not everyone is convinced.

The British-designed Yoomi features a warmer in the top of the bottle, containing the same gel found in hand-warmers.

Milk flows through a network of grooves on the outside of the warmer.

New invention: Yoomi only warms milk as it is being consumed - meaning the rest stays fresh

When it reaches the teat, it has been heated to 32C  – the same temperature as breast milk. Only milk being consumed is warmed, meaning the rest stays fresh.

Designer Jim Shaihk came up with the idea after his wife became exasperated that milk she had previously expressed into a bottle had to be thrown away if had been warmed up but was then left unused.

The warmer stays at the optimum temperature for up to an hour, after which it must be ‘recharged’, usually by  being placed in a steam steriliser for 25 minutes.

However, one blogger, The Booby Whisperer, points out that convenience doesn’t come cheap. The warmer can be recharged only 150 times, and the blogger estimates that parents would need to spend £32 a month on the product.

Other parents say their children don’t seem to care whether milk is warm or not.

Still, with UK sales of Yoomi in excess of 15,000 a year and rising, the product has legions of fans: ‘Perfect temperature straight from the fridge – what more could a busy mum want?’ wrote one online reviewer.
