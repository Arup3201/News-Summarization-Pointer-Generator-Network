It is a gripe that frustrates subway riders daily: men with their legs splayed.

So one woman decided to confront male commuters about the amount of space they consume.

The investigation comes a month before New York City's MTA launches a campaign targeting 'manspreaders'.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Confronted: A woman confronted men who take up space on New York City's subway by splaying their legs

Questions: She asked each male commuter whether they thought it appropriate to sit in such a way

Campaign: It comes ahead of the MTA's official campaign targeting 'manspreaders' about consideration

Just a male problem? The reporter asked men why they thought male passengers specifically did this

Despite adverts urging consideration of others, Gothamist's reporter did not have trouble finding interviewees.

Each man is asked if they think their own 'leg splay' is appropriate given the people around them.

Many insist this is not normal behavior.

One's splay is to accommodate a bag, another is exhausted.

A defiant passenger insists all men biologically require ample space.

They are then asked to measure - with a measuring tape - the appropriate amount of space allotted for a considerate 'manspread'.

That is where the results differ - from six inches to 18.

Measure it up: Handed a measuring tape, each man was asked to determine how wide is appropriate

Different opinions: Each man came up with a different measurement for inner leg to inner leg distance

Explanation: They each had ideas about when it was and wasn't appropriate to 'manspread'

Biology: One man insisted it is biologically mandatory that men sit with their legs splayed

Is it a problem? Some insisted nobody around them appeared 'squished'

They give very different answers about how many inches one can spread
