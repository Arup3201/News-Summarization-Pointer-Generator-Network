Telecoms giant BT today confirmed it will pay £152million to screen Premiership rugby on its forthcoming sports channel - as more than 10million of its customers face higher bills for phone calls, internet and TV packages.

The company has signed a four-year deal to show Aviva Premiership games from the 2013-14 season, one of the biggest broadcast agreements in the history of club rugby.

But the announcement came as the company confirmed it will introduce a raft of inflation-busting price hikes next year.

The rugby deal, which current rights-holders BSkyB and ESPN are thought to have considered overpriced, comes three months after BT forked out £738million to show 38 Premier League football matches per season.

BT is expected to sign further agreements for the right to broadcast additional sports later this year in an attempt to attract subscribers from rivals BSkyB and Virgin Media.

Marc Watson, chief executive of television service BT Vision, said: 'BT is serious about sport and this deal means we will be offering the very best rugby action alongside some of the mostthrilling football matches from the Premier League.

'That is a winning combination and one that will appeal to fans of both sports.'

The agreement covers exclusive live broadcast rights to up to 69 rugby matches per season.

Mark McCafferty, chief executive of Premiership Rugby, said: 'This is a game-changing agreement and will deliver a service that I know our club supporters will enjoy.'

BT shares on the FTSE 100 Index rose by 2 per cent following the announcement, as BSkyB shares dipped by just under 1 per cent.

But while investors in BT may have reason for optimism, customers face having to pay more for phone calls, broadband and TV packages.

BT's new pricing structure will come into force next January, with most charges due to rise by about 5.8 per cent.

Steep: The charge for BT's cheapest TV package, Vision Essentials, is to rise by 25 per cent from January

Some services will see prices rise by 25 per cent - almost 10 times the rate of inflation, which currently stands at 2.6 per cent.

BT's most popular phone calls plan - the Unlimited Anytime Plan - will cost £5.15 a month from January, a 5.1 per cent increase on the current monthly charge of £4.90.

This package includes all landline calls, including those to 0845 and 0870 numbers, but does not include calls to mobiles.

Customers without an inclusive package for calls will also be hit, as both daytime and evening rates will be raised.

Daytime local and national calls will rise from 7.95p to 8.41p per minute and the cost of evening calls will go up from 1.05p to 1.11p per minute.

Line rental will cost more from January, with prices increasing by 5.82 per cent.

Most households have no choice but to pay this charge in order to receive broadband, even when their internet access is provided by another company.

Customers who pay line rental charges by direct debit will see the price rise by 85p a month, from £14.60 to £15.45.

Users who pay by cash or cheque face monthly line rental bills of £17.45.

Price hikes: Daytime and evening rates for calls will rise for BT customers, and line rental for broadband will also become more expensive

The steepest price rises come for BT’s 728,000 Vision customers, who pay for TV channels.

The monthly charge for the Vision Essentials plan - BT's cheapest TV deal - will rise by 25 per cent from £4 to £5.

Sports channels will also be more expensive with some Vision packages seeing an increase of £2.70 a month.

Total Broadband and Broadband Anywhere packages are to become about 5.8 per cent more expensive, although other 'bundled' packages are unaffected.

BT has pledged to freeze 'key costs' after January until 2014.

But this does not include all charges, and the company is to increase some of its early termination fees.

John Petter, managing director of BT’s consumer division, said: 'We’ll be changing some prices in January, but we’ll then be freezing many key prices until 2014.

'We’re also telling customers how they can save money with BT.'

Under its Premier League football deal, BT has the rights to matches that kick off at 12.45pm on a Saturday and for bank holiday and midweek games.

The agreement will run for three years from August 2012.

Long-term Premier League partner Sky paid £2.28 billion to secure the rights to show 116 games a season.
