A Halloween horror cruise 'turned into a real nightmare' after the ship  ran aground and started severely tilting – forcing almost 1,000 costume-clad passengers to evacuate.

The Bahamas Celebration cruise was heading back to Palm Beach, Florida, when passengers said they heard a loud 'bang' and felt the 600ft tall ship shake before the vessel lost power.

More than 960 passengers were planning to attend the costume contest and zombie ball on Friday, but instead they were left waiting for hours to evacuate in the pitch black with no food or water.

'It was like an actual Halloween horror cruise turned into real life,' said passenger Daniel Fana.

Passengers initially thought it was a Halloween joke, but once they were told to put life jackets on and wait to be evacuated, many started to panic. 

'At first you kind of thought, maybe this is a Halloween joke and this is supposed to be funny,' said Wally Yoost.

'As we were walking out of the room, the whole boat just went black. Then passengers started to panic.'

Those aboard the ship were described as 'terrified' and many feared a repeat of the Costa Concordia disaster which killed 32 people. 

'Everybody was screaming at each other,' passenger Joan Fischer said. 'It turned into a nightmare.'

'The panic was just too much for my comfort,' said passenger Amanda Jones.

Fellow passenger LaShawn Farrar added, 'We could feel the boat tipping over.'

Hours after the alarm first sounded passengers made it safely off the boat and they were transferred to temporary accommodation. 

The cruise ship ran aground 200 yards outside Freeport Harbour and salvage crews assessed the damage caused by 'a small hole in the side of the vessel'. 

James Verillo, owner of the Bahamas Celebration cruise line, said on Saturday afternoon that a small hole on the side of the vessel has been repaired and the ship is in no danger of sinking.

The cruise line said that no passengers were ever in any danger, and everything was handled efficiently

'The ship is listing at about 10 per cent and there is a whole host of professionals on board dealing with the issue. There was a small hole on the side of the ship that has already been patched,' he said.

On Sunday morning, the luxury liner, which is almost the size of two football fields, was safely docked. 

Celebration Cruise Line said passengers were told to put on life vests and the ship returned to port after the boat hit something while leaving Grand Bahamas Island around 9pm on Friday,

'No passengers were ever in any danger, and everything was handled in an organised and efficient way by ship, corporate and Bahamian personnel,' the cruise line said.

Passengers paid up to $400 for the two-day horror cruise, which included assess to a number of Halloween-themed events, such as the 'Deck of Death'.

On the company's website, it says: 'The Deck of Death is inhabited by former passengers and crew members, some dead, some alive and some we don't know what they are.

'Warning, this tour is not recommended for anyone with a heart condition.'  

Two Celebration cruises scheduled for Saturday and today were canceled while damage to the boat was assessed.

'Our focus at this time (is) taking care of our passengers who were on the ship or had planned to be on the ship over the next few days,' Celebration said.
