This man, known only as X, had his sentence for carrying a knife delayed so he could go on holiday, where he was involved in a fatal stabbing

A convicted thug’s sentence for carrying a knife was delayed so that he could go on holiday abroad – where he was then involved in the fatal stabbing of a British teenager.

The 19-year-old was given a ten-week curfew and ordered to wear a tag at all times by District Judge Dennis Lynch. But The Mail on Sunday can now reveal he then permitted an 11-day suspension, so the youth could go on holiday.

Four days later, the youth – referred to only as ‘X’ for legal reasons – was involved in a brawl outside a bar in Malia, Crete, during which Tyrell Matthews-Burton, from Leyton, East London, was fatally stabbed through the heart. 

Tyrell’s mother, Sharon Matthews, says she is ‘shocked’ by the revelation and one family source says, had the curfew not been suspended, her son may have still been alive, as X played a ‘crucial role’ in the brawl.

X, who has been charged with affray by Greek police, was one of 17 British youths arrested in connection with the brawl.

Police in Malia are still unclear as to what triggered the brawl outside the Safari club in the early hours of July 22 last year.

John Kostadoudakis, a lawyer in Athens acting for Ms Matthews, said Tyrell and his friends and members of X’s group were all inside the bar when an argument broke out, possibly over a girl.

It appears that when Tyrell – who was in Crete to celebrate his 19th birthday – was leaving the bar, he was set upon by the group and stabbed. Despite paramedics’ attempts to save him, he died at the scene.

Within hours, Greek police had arrested 17 British youths in the resort, some with blood still smeared on their clothes.

Had the incident taken place in Britain, the entire group could have been charged with murder under the law of joint enterprise, in which all gang members are responsible for a murder even if one person struck the fatal blow. This concept does not exist in Greek law.

One of Tyrell’s alleged attackers, Myles Litchmore-Dunbar, 19, from Catford, South-East London, has been charged with murder, which he denies. 

Two others – Dejon Anaughe, 19, and Jordan Williams, 19 – have been charged with being accomplices to murder.

Five more – including ‘X’ – have been charged with affray. They have been allowed to return to the UK until a trial date is set.

The Mail on Sunday has seen a confidential letter from the Ministry of Justice to Labour MP Stella Creasy, in which Justice Minister Sailesh Vara reveals Judge Lynch’s extraordinary decision.

‘I am extremely concerned,’ said Miss Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow. ‘This man was sentenced for the possession of a knife, and then allowed to go on holiday where he became involved in an incident where someone was stabbed to death. Questions need to be asked.’

X appeared before Judge Lynch at Bromley Magistrates’ Court in Kent on July 17 last year. 

According to Mr Vara’s letter and a separate summary of the proceedings obtained by this newspaper from the court, X was arrested twice on the same day a week earlier in separate incidents in the Forest Hill area of South-East London. 

He was charged with cannabis possession and for carrying a folding pocket knife with a 3in blade. X pleaded guilty to both charges in court.

Judge Lynch did not sentence him for the cannabis possession but imposed a ten-week-long curfew, requiring he wear a tag and remain inside his house between 8pm and 6am each night. 

He ordered that the sentence start immediately, but X’s lawyer asked if it could be suspended between July 19-30 so X could go on a pre-booked holiday. The judge gave permission.

Four days later, X was in Malia with at least eight friends.

Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, added: ‘This is an extraordinary case. The judge’s decision to suspend a curfew to enable a defendant to go on holiday has been most unwise. 

The Lord Chief Justice should revisit sentencing guidelines to ensure these circumstances are never repeated.’

Writing in this newspaper today, Tyrell’s mother, a 43-year-old housing officer, said: ‘This is a complete shock. How can a judge allow a person convicted of such a serious offence to go on holiday before serving their sentence?’

Since his return to the UK, X has been arrested in South London for possession of cannabis as well as a fraud-related offence.

In May, police in Scotland charged him with possession of heroin and crack cocaine. He is on bail while he awaits trial.

This weekend Judge Lynch – who was appointed in 2004 and sits in courts in South-East London – could not be contacted for comment.

A spokesman for the Judicial Communications Office, which acts of behalf of judges, said: ‘Judges are obliged to follow sentencing guidelines. 

'Court documents show that the defendant had immediately pleaded guilty to possession of cannabis and a knife. He had no previous convictions. He had been on bail since his arrest and had committed no further offences.’

My son was killed on his 19th birthday... I need to know why, by Sharon Matthews

What does it mean to lose a child to a senseless murder? How do I feel? 

Imagine your child, cold and unresponsive to your touch. Imagine wanting to celebrate their birthday, only for it to be the date of their death.

I sent my son on holiday, not to war. Tyrell was in Malia, Crete, celebrating his 19th birthday with friends and due home two days later. 

On July 21, the day before his birthday, we spoke on the phone. He said he was having a good time. I told him I loved him and to take care.

Next day I tried to call to wish him happy birthday but kept getting his voicemail. I was not worried, I assumed he’d been out the night before and was sleeping. I headed off to work and, at lunchtime, went shopping.

I was at the chemists when my world was destroyed. My nephew called with the news: ‘Tyrell was injured in a fight.’

‘Is he OK?’ I murmured.

Silence, then: ‘No, I don’t think so.’

In the middle of Boots, in Stratford, East London, I started to scream and fell to my knees.

A security guard came to my aid and soon my colleagues and two police officers were by my side. 

Two more officers arrived and said Tyrell had been stabbed to death outside a club in Malia on his 19th birthday.

In the immediate aftermath, the press described it as a gang-fight. But this was contrary to Tyrell’s values and beliefs. He was charming and handsome – he could light up a room. 

He seemed confident, but was actually slightly shy and very humble.

Two days later, I went to Greece to identify his body. In the hospital mortuary, I held him, willing him to wake up, praying he would open his eyes when he realised Mum was there.

I touched his wounds, kissed his face and held his hands. The nightmare was finally real.

I returned to the UK, and went to collect my daughter Savannah, then five, from her grandmother. ‘Where’s TyTy?’ she asked, looking behind me. I could not find the words to tell her, so just said he wasn’t here. The disappointment in her face broke me.

It is a year since Tyrell’s precious life was cut short. His death was senseless, brutal and unnecessary. Why would anyone want to hurt him? How can people go on holiday armed with knives? How could they leave him in the street to die? 

Last week, my local MP Stella Creasy told me one of the men involved in the brawl leading to my son’s death was convicted of carrying a knife four days earlier. Yet a judge suspended his ten-week-long curfew for almost two weeks so he could go on holiday.

This is a complete shock. How can a judge allow a person convicted of such a serious offence to go on holiday before serving their sentence?

I am hurt and disappointed. Hurt, because there is no deterrent for such offences. Disappointed because it is a slap in the face for all the families of other young stabbing victims.

It does not bode well for the future. Judges must be tough on all knife crime, for the sake of society.
