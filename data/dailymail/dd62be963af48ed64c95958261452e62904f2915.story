A woman whose ex-boyfriend forced her to watch as he stabbed her sister and best friend to death says she will never forgive herself for bringing him into their lives.

Kim Frank, 17, and Samantha Sykes, 18, were murdered by 21-year-old Ahmad Otak at Kim's flat in Wakefield in March last year.

He plunged his knife into Kim as he pretended to be leaving the flat she shared with her older sister, his former girlfriend Elisa Frank.

Otak stood over Kim's body laughing, then licked blood from the knife and spat on her.

He then tied Elisa up, held her at 
knifepoint, and forced her to summon Miss Sykes to the flat, where he 
stabbed and slashed her 34 times.

Now Miss Frank, 20, has spoken about the double killing for the first time, and says she wishes Otak had killed her instead.

‘Every day I wish he had taken my 
life instead of theirs and I’ll never forgive myself for bringing him 
into their lives,' she told the Sunday Mirror.

'The only thing that stops me from killing myself now is that I can’t allow him to get three out of three.’

Miss Frank said she will never forget
the bloody scene of the deaths. She is haunted by flashbacks and 
nightmares and last year was sectioned under the mental health act after
a drug overdose.

The asylum seeker from Afghanistan 
was sentenced to life in prison after pleading guilty to the murders. He
must serve at least 34 years before he can be considered for release.

Otak abducted Miss Frank after the killings, using Miss Sykes' car to drive to Dover in a failed bid to flee to France.  

His plan was foiled when an Iranian refugee who was trying to leave Britain managed to grab his knife, told Miss Frank to run, and helped her to raise the alarm.

Sadistic Otak then claimed his ex had
helped him kill the two women and she was arrested. It took three days 
for her to be released.

Their relationship began when Miss Frank met Otak in a children's 
home in Wakefield. He had arrived in Britain in 2007 and claimed he was younger
than he was.

He told Miss Frank that his parents were dead and spoke 
about the murders he had seen back home.

Elisa and Kim had been taken into care when they were 14 and 13 respectively because their mother couldn't cope.

Their father walked out on the family when she was a baby, but has been reunited with his daughter since her horrific ordeal.

Kim was sent to live with a foster family in Wales, and Miss Frank turned to Otak to help her cope with depression following the separation.

Once she left the care system, the couple moved in together. They planned to marry in 2011, but Miss Frank called off the wedding once Otak's violent and controlling nature showed itself.

He controlled what she wore and made her walk behind him at all times.

'He started making up weird rules,' she told the paper. 'One day he told me I wasn’t allowed to talk to men any more. I wasn’t allowed to drink either because it wasn’t allowed in his culture. Then he stopped me from seeing certain girls he said were a bad influence.'

These 'bad influences' included her younger sister and Miss Sykes.

When Miss Frank protested against Otak's attitude towards the women, he hit her.

He thought the girls were 'dirty', despising Miss Sykes for 'flaunting' her body in her fledging modelling career and decrying Kim because she had had more than one boyfriend.

In September 2011 Miss Frank decided their relationship was over but relented when he threatened to throw acid in her face and petrol bomb her mother's house.

By February last year, Miss Frank had fled to Kim's flat after her sister's return to Wakefield.

Otak
had held a kitchen knife to her throat while forcing her to have sex 
with him. He then told her he would sew her mouth up if she screamed.

He bombarded his ex with calls and text messages, pleading for the couple to reunite.

Miss
Sykes reported Otak to the UK Border Agency and contacted police, but 
no action was taken because Miss Frank did not want to make a statement 
against him.

Ahmad Otak must serve 34 years in prison for the double murders before he can be considered for parole

A month after their split, Otak agreed to return the belongings Miss Frank had left behind when she fled their shared home for the safety of her sister's flat.

Once he had slaughtered Kim, he made Miss Frank speak to her best friend Miss Sykes on the phone.

'I was shaking with fear and praying she’d tell from my voice that something was wrong and raise the alarm, but 10 minutes later there was a knock at the door,' she told the paper.

'Ahmad went to meet her. I’ll never forget the sound of her screams as he plunged the knife into her. She called my name but I couldn’t get to her. Then he dragged her bleeding body into the living room and dumped her at my feet next to Kim.'

Miss Frank, who recently spent two months receiving psychiatric care in hospital, recalled the gurgling noises her sister and best friend made as they strugged for their last breaths. But she has vowed to keep going for Kim and Miss Sykes.
