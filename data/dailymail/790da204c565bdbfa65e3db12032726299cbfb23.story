They had gathered at Sandringham to celebrate Christmas, surrounded by 30 members of the Royal Family.

But it seems the festive spirit was put on hold on December 24 when Prince Harry took on Prince William on the football pitch.

Harry, still sporting his ginger beard from his recent expedition to the South Pole, lunged in for a tackle on The Duke of Cambridge during the annual charity match on the Norfolk estate.

Steady on: Prince Harry slides in for a tackle on his brother The Duke of Cambridge during the match at Sandringham estate

Tired: The 29-year-old who, was playing on the opposing side to his brother William, looked worn out after recently returning from his 200-mile trek to the South Pole

But the pair set 
aside their differences after the game between Sandringham estate workers and villagers from 
neighbouring Castle Rising, and gave each other a hug.

The
Duke of Cambridge, who was wearing a red and white striped shirt and 
light blue Aston Villa socks in honour of his favourite team, was also seen 
throwing himself into the game, which ended in a 2-2- draw.

With his thinning hair, onlookers said the 31-year-old looked like former England footballer Bobby Charlton.

But the Prince, who was sporting the bushy beard he grew on the trek, still managed to score the second goal for his team. Although at one point he got a telling-off from the referee for a wild tackle.

The brothers were also cheered on by their cousin Peter Phillips, his wife Autumn and their children.
