Manchester United's £60million star Angel di Maria will not be fit to take on Liverpool on Sunday, manager Louis van Gaal has confirmed.

Di Maria has not played since pulling up with a hamstring injury against Hull City in November, sitting out 2-1 victories over Stoke and Southampton.

And the Argentine will continue to be absent for the visit of rivals Liverpool, along with Chris Smalling, who has failed to recover from a groin injury.

But van Gaal insisted that United's injury crisis is coming to an end, with just four players - Di Maria, Smalling, Daley Blind and Luke Shaw - unavailable.

The Old Trafford outfit have sustained a remarkable 47 injuries since the Dutchman took over from David Moyes at the start of this season.

Despite the constant crisis, United sit third in the Premier League table, having won each of their last five matches. 

The Argentine has scored three goals since joining United in August, but has not found the net since October
