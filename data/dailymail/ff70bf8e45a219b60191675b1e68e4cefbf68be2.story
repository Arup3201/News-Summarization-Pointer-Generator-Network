Scottish Nationalist leader Nicola Sturgeon vowed yesterday to ‘frighten the life out of Westminster’ if her party storms to victory north of the border on May 7.

She demanded the abolition of the ‘undemocratic’ House of Lords and pledged to put the ‘backbone and guts’ into a Labour government led by Ed Miliband.

And Miss Sturgeon repeated her party’s promise to overthrow a Tory minority administration even if the Conservatives have more seats than any other party after the Election.

Nicola Sturgeon, whose critics have compared her to President Putin in attempting to divide the UK like Russia did Ukraine, has vowed to shake up the Westminster system 

The SNP is on course for huge gains on May 7, with Miss Sturgeon boasting it can win all 58 of Scotland’s Commons seats.

In a speech to SNP activists, she said a party that ‘frightens the life out of the Westminster establishment’ was ‘good news for ordinary people in Scotland and right across these islands’.

Miss Sturgeon, who is also the Scottish First Minister, said: ‘The House of Lords has no place in a democratic society.

‘Its members are paid £300 a day for just showing up, and it’s totally tax-free. That’s got to stop. It is now time to abolish the House of Lords.

‘So, yes, David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg, if you are worried that a strong SNP is a threat to all that is deeply undemocratic and unfair about the Westminster notion of democracy, then all I can say to you is this: you had better believe we are.’

Miss Sturgeon’s uncompromising message came after Tory whip Ben Wallace accused her of aping the tactics of Russian president Vladimir Putin in her bid to break up the UK.

Ms Sturgeon (far right) also repeated the pledge of Alex Salmond (near left) to vote with Labour to lock the Tories out of government, even if neither of their parties hold the biggest number of seats

He said: ‘Nicola Sturgeon is intent on stoking division in England in the same way Putin used it to break apart Ukraine.’ 

The SNP leader also faces accusations of trying to exert ‘Stalinist’ discipline over proposed new rules banning her MPs from speaking out against party policy.

Yesterday, Miss Sturgeon also echoed former party leader Alex Salmond, now bidding to return to Westminster as an MP, by insisting that the SNP would vote down a minority Conservative Government, despite the long-standing tradition that the party with the most MPs should have an opportunity to form a Government.

‘The SNP will never put the Tories into government – not now, not ever,’ she said. ‘As long as there are more anti-Tory MPs – Labour or SNP – than there are Tory MPs in the House of Commons, we can keep them out of government.’

Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said last night: ‘It is clearer than ever that the prospect of Ed Miliband, in Downing Street and dancing to Alex Salmond’s tune, would mean chaos for Britain.’
