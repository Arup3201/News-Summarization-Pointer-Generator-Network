This is the man police believe gunned down a wealthy Russian banker outside his executive flat.

Police investigating the attempted murder have released these CCTV images of the suspect moments after German Gorbuntsov was shot a number of times as he entered his block of flats near Canary Wharf, east London, on March 20.

Scotland Yard is liaising with Russian police for the first time on a major criminal inquiry since the diplomatic fallout over the death of dissident Alexander Litvinenko.

Suspect: A man is caught on CCTV moments after Russian banker German Gorbuntsov was shot as he entered his block of flats near Canary Wharf

The suspect, described as white, 6ft and slim, was wearing a dark hooded top and was seen running from Byng Street away from Westferry Road, towards Marsh Wall.

Detectives discovered a gun, hooded top and bag near the scene.

Detective Chief Inspector Russell 
Taylor, leading the investigation for the Metropolitan Police, said: 'We
are continuing to examine CCTV footage from the area and are keen to 
speak with anyone who may have information about the shooting.

'Were you in Byng Street or nearby, shortly before or after 7.20pm on Tuesday 20 March? Did you see anyone acting suspiciously in the area?

'Did you see the man in the CCTV stills taking off a dark hooded top or leaving a bag?'

Mr Gorbuntsov, 45, who was once jailed for robbery, amassed his fortune through stakes in six major banks in Russia and Moldova, a sports complex in Moscow and factories. He was also a property developer.

He remains in a stable condition in hospital. No arrests have been made.

Shortly before the attack Gorbuntsov had given evidence implicating his own associates in an earlier mafia-style assassination bid against Alexander Antonov, father of former Portsmouth FC owner Vladimir Antonov.

The banker, who had been at a business meeting in Bishopsgate in the City earlier that evening, hailed the hackney carriage at 7pm.

He had just stepped out of the car at 7.30pm when he fell in a hail of bullets. The hooded gunman, described as white, 6ft tall and slim, fled on foot.

A young blonde woman, reported to be Mr Gorbuntsov’s mistress and the mother of his second child, was at his side as emergency services arrived.

Mr Gorbuntsov's lawyer said the banker had been planning to submit a political asylum request to stay within days.

A successful asylum claim would have helped him fight off attempts by Moldova to extradite him on allegations of embezzlement.

There was also an apparent financial wrangle with state-controlled Russian Railways, whose president is an ally of Vladimir Putin.

An estimated £415million was allegedly not repaid after being deposited by the business into a Moscow bank whose ownership later passed to Mr Gorbuntsov and his associates.
