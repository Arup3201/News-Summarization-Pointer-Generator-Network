Rolf Harris admitted in court yesterday that he sexually admired his daughter’s friend when she was just 13.

The 84-year-old made the extraordinary statement as he conceded he is ‘pretty good at disguising the dark side’ of his character.

In a series of sensational exchanges, Southwark Crown Court heard how he thought his daughter Bindi’s young friend had a ‘great body’ when he saw her in a bikini on holiday in Hawaii in 1978.

Damaging: Sasha Wass QC (left) asked Rolf Harris (left) if the affair with his victim was 'no-frills sex' to which he said 'it was' before he admitted he found her attractive at 13

The married father of one, who was then 46, recalled how he had complimented the schoolgirl – who was ‘like a daughter’ to him.

Prosecutor
 Sasha Wass, QC, asked him: ‘What you were saying is, “You have got a 
great body”, weren’t you?’ He replied: ‘I suppose so.’

The prosecutor continued: ‘When she was 13?’ Quietly, he answered: ‘Yes’

The
 prosecutor added: ‘You made it plain you did admire her body and you 
admired it sexually, that’s what that is.’ Harris answered: ‘It did not 
compute to that in my mind.’

Prosecution QC Sasha Wass (SW) today put it to Rolf Harris (RH) compliments he made to a girl about her bikini was actually a comment on her body, and suggested he was admiring her sexually.

Here is the exchange in full:

SW: 'Do you accept that when a man tells a woman or a girl that they look lovely in a bikini, they are not actually admiring the clothing, but they are admiring the person's body?'

RH: 'Possibly.'

SW: 'What you were saying to (the alleged victim) is "You have got a great body".'

RH: 'I suppose so.'

SW: 'When she was 13?'

RH: 'Yes.'

SW: 'And you made it plain to (the alleged victim) on that holiday that you did admire her, admire her body?'

RH: 'On one occasion, possibly.'

SW: 'And you admired her sexually, that's what that is.'

RH: 'It did not compute to that in my mind ... in hindsight, I suppose it is.'

SW: 'It seems from where we are going from your answers to the questions that you admired (the alleged victim's) body sexually during that holiday.'

RH: 'It's possible, yes.'

SW: 'And, of course, once we work out that you did see (the alleged victim) in a sexual light during that holiday, everything that (she) says becomes realistic, doesn't it?'

RH: 'Not as far as I'm concerned, because it never happened.'

Miss Wass said: ‘It was a sexual remark.’ Harris said: ‘In hindsight, I  suppose it was.’

Miss
 Wass continued to press him, adding: ‘In hindsight, you must have 
admired her body sexually during that holiday?’ Harris muttered: ‘It’s 
possible, yes.’                             

The
 prosecutor claimed the holiday marked the start of a 16-year grooming 
campaign by the children’s TV presenter, which would turn the shy 
13-year-old girl into an alcoholic, compliant ‘toy’ whom Harris could 
‘play with’ whenever he wanted.

During
 cross-examination, she told him: ‘You are pretty good, aren’t you, at 
disguising that dark side of your character?’ Harris replied: ‘Yes.’

Miss
 Wass told jurors: ‘The issue is how dark that dark side actually is. 
This was not a consensual relationship, this was child abuse, grooming, 
and you effectively psychologically dominated that girl into womanhood.’

She continued: ‘You have 
had to admit that the private Rolf Harris had a sexual involvement with 
 your daughter’s friend?’ Harris replied: ‘Yes.’

Miss
 Wass added: ‘So close to Bindi that she was almost like Bindi’s sister –
 this would have made her your daughter.’ Harris said: ‘Yes.’

Yesterday
 the court heard how the entertainer’s daughter flew into a rage when 
her friend told her of her father’s betrayal, and smashed up paintings 
he had given her in around 1997.

Harris
 said a ‘huge row’ had erupted, adding: ‘I believe she told Bindi – I 
was away in Australia – and I believe she had smashed a couple of 
paintings that I had given her, she was furious.’ But the star insisted 
that he was ‘targeted’ by her flirtatious friend who seduced him when 
she was 18 and ‘instigated all the moves’.

He said the pair had a relationship based on ‘a mutual feeling of warmth and affection’.

Asking
 him to explain a letter of apology he later wrote to the alleged 
victim’s father after she had told her family of the alleged abuse, Miss
 Wass accused Harris of thinking he was ‘untouchable’.

Speaking in a low voice, Harris told jurors: ‘That’s not what I intended at all.’

He
 denied getting ‘a thrill’ out of sexually assaulting the victim in 
Bindi’s presence, including one occasion when he allegedly performed a 
sex act on the girl when she was 15 as Bindi, then 16, slept a few feet 
away.

He insisted that it would be ‘physically not possible’ to look at his daughter and perform the act.

The
 Australian told jurors that he ‘laughed in disbelief’ when the alleged 
victim confronted him in 1997 at the age of 31. He claimed the only 
reason the woman was ‘emotionally dead’ and ‘damaged’ was because she 
‘felt scorned’ when their relationship fizzled out and he later began an
 affair with his 35-year-old housekeeper.

The entertainer, who faced his second day in the witness box today, revealed his daughter was 'furious'

Harris is accused of attacking three other girls aged seven to 19 between 1968 and 1986.

Yesterday
 Miss Wass accused him of adopting a ‘technique’ of ‘a friendly hug, 
disguised as sexual molestation’ in all the assaults.

She
 added: ‘There are a series of events in this case where you have taken 
advantage of the fact that you are a well-loved children’s entertainer.’

She
 also accused him of being aware of child abuse tactics having taken 
part in an NSPCC campaign to raise awareness of the dangers. But Harris 
told the court his accusers had invented the same lie, saying: ‘They are
 all making it up’. 

Yesterday his friend pantomime producer Paul 
Elliott, dubbed the ‘king of pantomime’, said Harris was ‘warm, cuddly 
and jolly’ and he had never been concerned about his behaviour around 
children.

Family: Veteran entertainer Rolf Harris arrives at Southwark Crown court with daughter Bindi (left), wife Alwen and niece Jenny (right), where he admitted it was 'possible' he sexually admired a 13-year-old in a bikini

Dressed in a dark blue suit, Harris had shuffled into court slowly  yesterday and spoke in mostlty hushed tones.

It was in marked contrast to his ‘polished performance’ a day  earlier, which saw the entertainer bursting into song.

Miss
 Wass said he had ‘delighted’ jurors, but warned: ‘This case as you know
 is not a talent show, is it? This case is taking place to decide 
whether underneath your friendly and loveable exterior there is a darker
 side lurking.

‘Even on your own account, the private Rolf Harris was very different from the public Rolf Harris.’

Harris replied: ‘I suppose so.’

He denies 12 counts of indecent assault.

The trial continues.

Evidence:  Rolf Harris as he was shown a photo of one of the complainants in a bikini during her holiday in the 1970s. The star admitted he had 'sexually admired' her but denied he abused her

Rolf Harris admitted he goes home alone every night - despite walking into court arm-in-arm with his wife and daughter.

It came after the 84-year-old entertainer told Southwark Crown Court his daughter Bindi 'furiously' smashed up paintings he had given her on learning about the affair with her friend.

Sasha Wass QC said: 'You have been coming to court everyday, walking 
slowly into court with Bindi on one arm and your wife on the other', and
 asked if they travelled home together.

Harris said 'no'.

Show of support: Rolf Harris (pictured last Wednesday walking hand-in-hand with daughter Bindi, left, and wife Alwen, right) admitted he goes home alone every night from Southwark Crown Court

Prosecutor Sasha Wass QC accused Harris of coming in with his faimly (pictured yesterday) 'for the cameras'

Ms Wass asked: 'So it's just for the cameras is it? Coming in with them?'

'It's to show support,' he said.

Ms Wass asked Harris if he had paid legal fees for his daughter Bindi and wife Alwen, who were accompanied by solicitors when they attended police interviews.

'It may have been arranged through my accountant, I didn't know about it,' he said.

His revelation came after Harris told the court Bindi (left, today) was 'furious' when she learned of the affair

The entertainer told the court that his alleged victim had told Bindi about their affair while he was away in Australia.

'When I came back she had smashed a couple of paintings that I had given her, she was furious.'

Asking Harris if he had discussed the case with his daughter, Ms Wass asked if he had 'put her up' to giving certain evidence, to which he replied: 'No, no discussions at all.'

Harris was released from the witness box while friend and pantomime producer Paul Elliott gave evidence.

The case was adjourned to 10am tomorrow, when Harris will continue to be cross-examined.
