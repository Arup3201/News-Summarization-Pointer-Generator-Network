Hollywood is split down the middle over whether Andy Serkis should get an Oscar for his 'motion captured' role in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

Hollywood is split down the middle over whether British actor Andy Serkis should get an Oscar for his 'motion captured' role in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.

The cinematic star is being tipped as a contender for a golden statuette for his role as Caesar in the summer blockbuster.

But Tinsel Town has yet to decide whether Serkis's performance playing a computer-generated ape is acting or a character solely brought to life through computer programmers in an animation studio.

The movie proved a smash hit in cinemas internationally and brought in box office profits of $707.4m. The stars of the Apes are currently in Hollywood promoting the DVD release of the movie.

Studio 20th Century Fox is promoting its cast for the supporting acting categories in the Academy Awards, and Serkis would be the first actor to win an Oscar for a 'motion capture' role, it emerged.

But the potential win for Serkis's performance, which was filmed using 'motion-capture' technology, has sparked a fresh debate in Hollywood over whether it counts as acting or animation.

A managing director of UK film and television post-production house Molinare, said the star should be considered for an Oscar because whether he's played an ape or a man, it's all performance.

Julie Parmenter said: 'In this case the animal he's portraying comes from his expertise and understanding of the role and that is truly acting.

Makers of motion capture systems say the performance by Andy Serkis (at front) 'deserves consideration'

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, a summer blockbuster hit, brought in box office profits totalling up to $707.4m

'It is a powerful role in the film; a costume may have been superimposed on him but it's still him acting.'

Phil Elderfield, entertainment product manager at Vicon, which makes motion-capture systems, said Serkis's acting should be counted in as the award season in Hollywood gets into gear.

'We are teetering on the edge of recognition for some performances motion capture has delivered. This is a remarkable piece of work and Andy's performance is deserving of consideration.'

But actors themselves are divided over whether the 'motion capture' performance is actually acting.

Serkis's co-star Gary Oldman has cast doubt over whether his performance was 'the sort of thing' the Academy will accept because of the heavy use of computer generated imagery.

And Jeff Bridges worries that his profession will end up redundant if Hollywood does consider the British man's performance to be acting and therefore entitled to be nominated for awards.

'Actors will kind of be a thing of the past,' he told the LA Times.

'We'll be turned into combinations. A director will be able to say: 'I want 60 per cent Clooney; give me 10 per cent Bridges and throw some Charles Bronson in there'.'

Actors' unions have no objection though, and see the possible shift to accepting a performance made part-animation lab, part-acting is a good thing for actors.

Martin Brown, assistant general secretary of actors union Equity, said: 'It simply hasn't been a matter for debate in Equity. No one is asking if Andy Serkis is acting or not.

'No concerns have been raised to us. It's new work and actors are moving with it.'

Serkis, 50, describes himself as 'evangelical' about the technology and has even set up his own motion-capture company The Imaginarium Studios.
