A furious Labour frontbencher has dismissed David Cameron as a ‘low rent PR man’ after being personally singled out by the Prime Minister for abuse at the Tory conference last week.

Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt accused the Prime Minister of demeaning his office with the ‘boorish’ attack on his background.

In his set-piece conference speech on Wednesday, the PM ridiculed Mr Hunt for going to an exclusive private school but wanting to ‘restrict’ other children from having the same advantages.

The Labour shadow minster said it was a ‘highly personalised attack on me, my family and upbringing’ and claimed it was reminiscent of the ‘boorishness’ of Jeremy Clarkson.

Mr Hunt, elected in 2010 but already tipped as a future party leader, was educated at the private University College School in north London before studying history at Trinity College, Cambridge.

In his conference address on Wednesday, Mr Cameron said: ‘Tristram Hunt, their shadow education secretary, like me, had one of the best educations money can buy.

‘But guess what? He won't allow it for your children. He went to an independent school that wasn't set up by a local authority … but no, he doesn't want charities and parents to set up schools for your children.'

Mr Cameron added: ‘He had the benefit of world-class teachers who happened not to have a government certificate … but no, he wants to stop people like that from teaching your children.

‘I tell you – Tristram Hunt and I might both have been educated at some of the best schools in our country. But here's the difference: you, Tristram – like the rest of the Labour party – want to restrict those advantages. I want to spread them to every child in Britain.’

Mr Hunt said the Prime Minister’s ‘assault’ was triggered in a refusal among the Tories ‘to believe that anybody called Tristram could or should be a member of the Labour party’.

He said: 'To be accused by David Cameron in his party conference speech of “hypocrisy” was rich indeed. 

'But his highly personalised attack on me, my family and upbringing spoke volumes about the man himself – and his inability, following those revelations about the Queen “purring” down the phone to invest the office of prime minister with the dignity it deserves.' 

He added: 'Cameron has moved on little since his time as a low-rent PR man.' 

The Prime Minister said Mr Hunt had enjoyed 'one of the best educations money can buy' but did not want other children to enjoy such privilege

Mr Hunt saidBut Labour politicians regularly taunt Mr Cameron over his ‘out of touch’ background – with remarks about his education at Eton and membership of the Bullingdon Club at Oxford. 

Mr Cameron’s attack is reminiscent of the Tory leader Michael Howard's Commons put down of Tony Blair in 2004 when he said: ‘This grammar school boy is not going to take any lessons from that public schoolboy.’
