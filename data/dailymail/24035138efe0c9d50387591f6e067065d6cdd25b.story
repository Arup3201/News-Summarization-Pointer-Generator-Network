A nine-year-old boy is fighting for life in hospital after falling from the door of a moving coach this afternoon.

The incident happened shortly before 3.45pm when the boy fell from a door towards the back of a double-decker coach as it travelled on the A47 at Tilney All Saints.

The boy suffered serious injuries as a result and was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King’s Lynn where his condition is described as critical.

The boy was taken here to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, King's Lynn after falling from a coach as it travelled back from a rugby tournament at Cromer

Thirty passengers, 20 children and 10 
adults, were on board the 71-seater coach at the time of the incident 
although no one else was injured.

The
 youngsters are from Stamford Rugby Club in Lincolnshire and were 
travelling home after playing in a tournament at Holt, north Norfolk 
when the accident happened.

Superintendent Dave Marshall said: ‘This is a serious incident which has left a nine-year-old boy fighting for his life.

Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Kings Lynn is treating the nine-year-old boy

‘The
 circumstances of how the boy came to fall from the coach will form part
 of our investigation and it would be inappropriate to speculate further
 at this stage.

‘The boy’s parents, who were travelling with the teams, are being supported by specially trained officers.’

The road remains closed while police carry out investigations and the coach is recovered and local diversions are in place
