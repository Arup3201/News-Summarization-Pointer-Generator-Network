Cleaning can be a thankless task, but for one theatre worker it has proved nothing of the sort.

Pat Pearce has taken full advantage of her unrivalled access backstage by having her picture taken with every celebrity she has ever dusted around.

The 77-year-old became known as Mrs Mop to the Stars during her two decades cleaning the dressing rooms of the Bristol Hippodrome.

And now she has 15 albums crammed with celebrity snaps, which show her meeting some of her idols including Aussie legend Rolf Harris and Lionel Blair.

Other shots show her with drag queen Dame Edna Everage and Moon River crooner Andy Williams.

Pat, from Bristol, said: 'We had so much fun. I loved Su Pollard. She was so friendly, it was like we'd known each other for years.

'But my all-time favourite was Albert Finney. He was so sincere. After we'd been photographed I thanked him for posing with me, and he said: "You must not thank me, it is for me to thank you". I thought that was so lovely.

'I've had a drink with Tommy Steele, enjoyed a chat with Gary Wilmot and on one evening I even went for a Chinese meal with Frank Bruno and Little and Large. It's the kind of evening you don't forget in a hurry.'

There's no doubt in Pat's mind which of the celebrities was the best tipper.

'Victor Spinetti,' she says. 'He actually had a tip left for the cleaner getting his dressing room ready for him, before he'd even arrived.

'I'd get chatting to them all, most of them were lovely people, and it became a bit of a thing to try to get photographed with each of them.

'The only one who was really miserable about being photographed was Harry Seacombe, which surprised me, but perhaps it was his illness kicking in by that point.'

She said: 'I went to the city council for a job interview. It was only as I was walking away from the Council House, past the Hippodrome, I thought - I should call in there and ask if they have any cleaning jobs going.

'I thought it would be unlikely, but I'd always loved the theatre. My aunt and uncle used to take me to the variety shows there when I was young. It was a magical place for me. I was amazed when they said there was a position, and agreed to take me on.

'It sounds glamorous, but it was hard work - cleaning that theatre is the hardest work I've ever done. On my first day I heard one of the other girls saying that she'd 'give me until the weekend', so I was determined to stick it out.'

But for the next 20 years she was up every weekday at 5am and 4am on a Sunday in order to get the threatre ship-shape from the night before.

'I would have to clean beneath 508 chairs in the circle every shift, she added. 'Sometimes I had to clean the boxes and the stalls, and I'd often even have to clean the stars' dressing rooms.

'I used to spend so much time on my knees cleaning the chairs, I took to wrapping bandages around them before each shift.

'I can't get out of the house much these days, after having operations on my spine. I certainly can't get to the Hippodrome anymore to see the shows, so for me it means so much to be able to look through these books and relive all the happy memories.'
