Ted Terry has been cleared of racist abuse at the Old Bailey

The father of Chelsea captain John Terry has been cleared of racist abuse at the Old Bailey.

Ted Terry, 59, had been accused of headbutting Amarjit Talafair and calling him a ‘f****** P***’ after a drunken row over a cigarette.

Speaking outside court Terry said he felt 'relieved' at the verdict.

The court heard that Terry and two friends got into a confrontation over a cigarette with Mr Talafair and his friends outside The Windsor pub near Fenchurch Street station on March 22 last year.

Both groups had been drinking in the pub to celebrate birthdays, the court heard.

Giving evidence, Terry admitted putting his face against Mr Talafair's and calling him a 'f***** tight p****', but denied headbutting him or saying 'f****** Paki, let's have it right here and now'.

The father of two and grandfather of six told the jury: 'I just said 'F*** off, go back downstairs', things like that. It wasn't no racist stuff.'

Mr Talafair told the jury that he had suffered no injury from Terry's headbutt because he was able to get out of the way in time.

He admitted calling Terry a 'fat bald p****' during the stand-off.

The alleged victim reported the incident to police the following day after researching Terry online.

He asked officers about taking his story to the press, but was told it would hamper the investigation, the court heard.

The jury of seven men and five women has heard that the Chelsea captain's father received a 24-month conditional discharge for common assault in 2005 and a suspended prison sentence for an offence of supplying class A drugs in 2010.

Two months after being arrested for racially aggravated assault in March last year, Terry admitted racially abusing another man.

He was fined £200 for saying 'f****** Irish p****' during a bust-up at Barking railway station, the court heard.

Terry, from Grays in Essex, denies one count of racially-aggravated common assault and one count of racially-aggravated fear or provocation of violence.

Niland, of Quarles Park Road in Romford, Essex, and Musteata, of Tarves Way in Greenwich, south east London, deny one count each of racially-aggravated fear or provocation of violence.
