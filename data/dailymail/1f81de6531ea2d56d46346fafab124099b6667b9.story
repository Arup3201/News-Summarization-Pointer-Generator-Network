David Cameron faces acute embarrassment over his friendship with former newspaper boss Rebekah Brooks after she claimed he signed off his text messages to her with ‘LOL’, wrongly believing it stood for ‘lots of love’.

Mrs Brooks told the Leveson inquiry into media standards that the Prime Minister stopped using the acronym after she told him it actually meant ‘laugh out loud’ in the text-speak more commonly used by teenagers.

But she dismissed as ‘preposterous’ claims he had texted her as much as 12 times a day, saying they both had ‘better things to do’ and it was typically once a week.

Revelations: Rebekah Brooks gives evidence to the Leveson Inquiry as she discusses emails and texts between politicians

In an extraordinary five-hour evidence session, the former News International chief executive lifted the veil on her close relationships with the PM and his predecessors Gordon Brown and Tony Blair.

She said Mr Cameron, Mr Blair and Chancellor George Osborne all sent her ‘indirect’ messages of support last year as her career was engulfed by the phone hacking scandal at the News of the World.

Mrs Brooks detailed 19 private meetings with Mr Cameron over five years, and said Tony Blair and his allies were a ‘constant presence’ in her life during the New Labour years. She described how Mr Blair and Mr Brown competed jealously for her attention as their feud threatened to destroy the Labour government.

But to Downing Street’s relief, she went out of her way to dismiss the more damaging conspiracy theories swirling around Mr Cameron, insisting he had never given any private assurances the Government would approve a controversial Murdoch takeover bid for BSkyB.

The 43-year-old former editor of the Sun and the News of the World confirmed that Mr Cameron sent her a message ‘along the lines’ of ‘keep your head up’ as the hacking scandal escalated, telling her he regretted not being able to be more loyal to her in public.

She received similar messages from 11 Downing Street, the Home Office, the Foreign Office and some senior Labour politicians, including Mr Blair.

Mr Brown and wife Sarah had at one stage organised a birthday party for her, she said, but their relationship soured after the Sun abandoned support for Labour during his premiership and he did not contact her after she resigned.

‘He was probably getting the bunting out,’ Mrs Brooks suggested.

For those unacquainted with text language, terms such as LOL (Laugh Out Loud) and OMG (Oh My God) were first used by teenagers to speed up the sending of messages.

David Cameron - modern man?

Examples of text-speak include plz for please, 2moro for tomorrow and WUU2 for what are you up to?

Not to mention BRB: Be right back; LOLZ: Lots of laughs; ROFL: Rolling on the floor laughing; BTW: By the way; TMI: Too much information; SMH: Shake my head; KMT: Kiss my teeth.

She insisted she had never abused her friendships with politicians, or allowed them to skew the editorial coverage of them in her newspapers.

Of her texts from the Prime Minister, she said: ‘He would sign them off “DC” in the main. Occasionally he would sign them off “LOL”, lots of love, actually until I told him it meant “laugh out loud”. Then he didn’t sign them like that any more.’

The Prime Minister is known to have used the ‘LOL’ sign-off in text messages to other people.

Publisher and radio presenter Iain Dale, a former Tory candidate, said: ‘David Cameron has also signed off a couple of texts to me “LOL, DC x”. He does it to lots of people.’

Mrs Brooks said she met or dined with Mr Blair at least 30 times between 1998 and 2007, including three tete-a-tete.

She had at least five encounters with his successor Mr Brown before their relationship deteriorated.She said her husband, racehorse trainer Charlie Brooks, and his family were long-standing friends of the Camerons and described regular meetings with the PM and his wife Samantha.

She entertained them at her home in the Cotswolds and Mr Cameron invited her to his family home and also to Chequers, three times.

On two occasions Mr and Mrs Brooks entertained Mr Cameron at their home, including a now notorious Christmas lunch in 2010 when it has emerged that the Murdochs’ bid for BSkyB was briefly discussed.

Mrs Brooks said the issue had come up because days earlier Business Secretary Vince Cable had been stripped of responsibility to approve the bid after being covertly recorded saying he had ‘declared war on Murdoch’. Culture Secretary Mr Hunt had been handed responsibility for the issue.

Robert Jay QC, counsel to the inquiry, asked if she had been ‘party to any conversations along the lines that Dr Cable had acted in breach of duty, let’s hope the next one, Mr Hunt, does not’.

‘Not necessarily, but clearly that was our view,’ she said. ‘We hoped that it would be a very fair process and that it would be fair and democratic.’

Mrs Brooks suggested she might have told Mr Cameron of her disappointment that Dr Cable’s ‘personal prejudice’ had been influencing the Government, adding that ‘at least now the decision would be fair’.

‘Mr Cameron always made it very clear that it was a quasi-judicial decision, it wasn’t [for] him, it was off his remit,’ she added.

Rebekah Brooks she would be hypocritical to complain about intrusion into her personal relationships, but a lot of the criticism and gossip she experienced was 'gender-based'.

She complained during her appearance today that a lot of trivial questions had been put to her - in her evidence she quashed a rumour that the pair used to swim together when Mr Murdoch was in London.

She also denied that, after she was arrested in 2005 over an alleged assault on her then-husband, Mr Murdoch sent an outfit to the police station where she was being held. Mrs Brooks was released without charge and the police took no further action.

'I think that my relationship with Mr Murdoch - if I was a grumpy old man of Fleet Street, no one would write the first thing about it,' she said.

She said it would be the 'height of hypocrisy' for her to complain about intrusions into her personal life, but said: 'However, I have had these complaints from people in my career as a journalist and I have always tried to understand and always tried to use my judgment to where the line fell.

'As to my own situation, well, it's been a difficult year, but a lot of the questions that I have had from Mr Jay (Robert Jay QC, counsel to the inquiry), I felt concentrated on quite a trivial side.

'I am happy to discuss them but I'm not sure it helps this inquiry, whether Mr Murdoch bought me a suit or not, or I went swimming with him."She told the inquiry the Murdochs were "just like any normal family, they have dynamics and they change'.

Asked by Mr Jay if a claim made in Vanity Fair that she became a 'go-between' in an increasingly fraught relationship between Rupert and James Murdoch was true, she said: 'No, they could speak to each other. I reported both to James and Rupert Murdoch and I would talk to them both about the issues unfolding at News International.

'James and I had offices next door to each other. I would be talking to Mr Murdoch every day. And if Vanity Fair wants to couch that as a go-between, then fine, but I don't accept the premise of what they are insinuating.'
