It was the most devastating pandemic in human history.

But 25 skeletons discovered by railway engineers beneath London suggest the Black Death was even more lethal than previously thought.

After analysing the teeth of the corpses, scientists believe the bubonic plague – spread by the bites of infected fleas living on black rats – mutated into a more virulent strain that passed easily from human to human.

New theory: Analysis of skeletons discovered in London believed to be victims of the Black Death suggests the disease was not spread by rat fleas, but was in fact airborne

DNA of plague bacteria taken from the 25 skeletons discovered in Clerkenwell was compared to samples from a recent outbreak in Madagascar which killed 60 people

The remains were discovered during excavations of Charterhouse Square in Farringdon, London, an area of the capital left largely undisturbed for years

This 'pneumonic' form of plague 
infected the lungs of sufferers, meaning they could spread the disease 
simply by coughing – fatal in medieval Europe's crowded cities. It also 
had a much lower survival rate and could kill within 24 hours.

The
 outbreak claimed the lives of around 75million people in the 14th 
century. The researchers say only the more contagious strain can explain
 why so many died.

Among the
 victims was Edward III's daughter, Joan, who sailed to Europe to marry 
the heir to the Spanish throne of Castile. She died of the plague within
 ten days of arriving.

The 
new findings, revealed in Channel 4 documentary Secret History: Return 
of the Black Death, which will air on Sunday, emerged after engineers 
working on the Crossrail project discovered 25 skeletons while digging 
26 miles of tunnels beneath the capital.

They
 were found close to Smithfield Market last year, in neat rows on two 
levels sealed under a layer of clay. Thousands of bodies are thought to 
have been interred at an emergency burial site there.

Teeth
 from 12 of the skeletons were sent for analysis and four tested 
positive for Yersinia pestis. The deadly bacterium is responsible for 
both bubonic and pneumonic plague. But the researchers concluded that 
the bubonic strain could not have had the devastating impact seen during
 the Black Death.

Dr Tim 
Brooks, an expert in infectious diseases at Public Health England, said:
 'As an explanation for the Black Death in its own right, [bubonic 
plague is] simply not good enough.

The researchers were shocked to discover that the two samples were an almost perfect match, meaning the 14th century plague was no more virulent than it is today

The DNA samples, which were extracted from the molar teeth of the skeletons, have also revealed intriguing details of the victims' lives

Don Walker, an osteologist with the Museum of London with one of the 25 skeletons found by construction workers under central London's Charterhouse Square last year

'It
 cannot spread fast enough from one household to the next to cause the 
huge number of cases that we saw during the Black Death epidemics.'

He
 added: 'In a small number of people … the organism will spread to their
 lungs and they will then develop a pneumonia. It is that critical 
switch, that if there were enough people in contact with them, that 
allows it to spread as a pneumonic plague.'

Fellow
 researcher Don Walker, of the Museum of London Archaeology, said the 
pneumonic form was 'more lethal', adding: 'There was no chance of 
recovery.'

Bring out your dead: The Black Death decimated the population of Britain in the mid 14th century killing an estimated six of 10 Londoners

The new finding have come from comparing DNA from teeth of the skeletons to samples from a recent plague outbreak in Madagascar

The excavation work was being carried out in order to make way for the new Crossrail train line

Six out of 10 bodies analysed were born and bred in London. But four had come from further afield - presumably seeking work - from the South East of England, central England or the East of England and one from northern England or Scotland

The remains also revealed that one of the bodies could have been that of a monk - after showing signs of vegetarianism in later life, which is something a Carthusian monk would have done during the 14th century

Archaeologist Jay Carver said: 'Analysis of the Crossrail find has revealed an extraordinary amount of information allowing us to solve a 660-year mystery'

Scientists have been examining skeletons of plague victims unearthed in Clerkenwell, London

@highlight

They compared DNA taken from bones with samples from a recent outbreak in Madagascar which killed 60 people

The two samples were an almost perfect match, meaning the plague was no more virulent than it is today

They now believe that the disease was airborne and had to have been spread by coughs and sneezes
