A four-year-old has been diagnosed with a fatal brain tumour after falling over and bumping his head.

After the accident, a precautionary hospital scan revealed that Jayden Wilson had not injured himself, but that he had a grade four tumour.

His parents have been told that he has just a year to live.

Jayden (pictured with his parents, Lou and Mike, and his sister, Ella) was diagnosed with a brain tumour after banging his head. He had a precautionary scan that showed a mass in his brain

Jayden was given the CT scan hours after a fall two weeks ago, and following the discovery of a mass on his brain, he was transferred to a hospital specialising in brain surgery.

After an MRI scan and biopsy, doctors told his mother, Lou, and father, Mike, that he has cancer.

After what they described as the ‘worst weeks of our lives’ the couple are now fundraising to make the rest of Jayden’s life full of special days.

Not much has changed for the lively four-year-old since the fall on August 28.

He has started at a new school, has played with his favourite Lego, and spent precious moments with his parents and older sister Ella, at their home in Basingstoke.

Mr Wilson, a professional freerunner who has featured in films including Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and Pirates of the Caribbean, said: ‘We are staying very positive and are meeting doctors to decide the way forward.’

After his scan, Jayden was referred to Southampton Children's Hospital where he had an MRI scan and a biopsy. These tests showed that he has a grade four tumour

Jayden’s parents have also put out a ‘global appeal’ on Facebook for ‘energy and positive thoughts’.

In just two weeks, it has been shared more than 12,000 times and messages of support have flooded in from around the world.

The couple wrote: ‘On August 28 2013, our little boy fell resulting in a bump to his head, due to becoming unsteady on his feet. He taken to was North Hampshire Hospital.

‘They performed a CT scan where unfortunately they found something.

‘Jayden was immediately rushed to Southampton Children’s Hospital where the top neuro brain specialist did an MRI scan.

‘Now I must state at this point that up until his fall, he had NO symptoms whatsoever, which is why this has been such a devastating and total shock to our family.

Jayden (pictured with his sister, Ella, on his first day of school) currently seems well but he has been given just a year to live. His parents are currently considering whether he should have radiotherapy

‘The results came back and unfortunately the neuro specialist confirmed they were 80 to 90 per cent certain it is a tumour.

‘If Jayden does have a tumour he has an average of one year to live. He is just four.

‘We are reaching out to the world for hope and energy believing our beautiful little boy will survive this and have a normal life.’

They received the news Jayden definitely had a tumour during an appointment with a consultant on Wednesday.

They wrote: ‘The news we had back today was our worst nightmare.

‘They grade tumours one to four with four being the worst and, yes, Jayden’s is four. It’s the worst news ever to get told anyone’s child is going to die.

Jayden's parents wrote on Facebook: 'The news we had back today was our worst nightmare. They grade tumours one to four with four being the worst and, yes, Jayden's is four. It's the worst news ever'

‘I wouldn’t wish this on anyone’s child, let alone mine.’

Fundraising events have been planned around Basingstoke and donations of Jayden’s favourite toy Lego have been dropped in.

His parents now have to meet again with doctors and decide if they should consider radiotherapy.

They said: ‘It’s pros and cons, it would make him very sick and ill, and maybe give him a few extra months to live.

‘If we don’t do it, he will go downhill when his little body is ready. It’s a very hard choice we have to make, a choice that no parent wants to make.’
