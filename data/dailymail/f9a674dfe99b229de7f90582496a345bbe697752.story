A towering high school basketball star dominating the court in the nation's capital has much more than a height advantage, a startling new report has revealed.

Junior Etou, who is originally from the Congo, is the talk of the town in Washington, DC, where he plays power forward for the Bishop O'Connell High School Knights.

But the 6'7" high school senior, who has drawn interest from several colleges with storied basketball programs, is almost legally allowed to drink.

Dominant: At 6'7", Junior Etou towers over his competitors, who may be as many as six years younger than him

School: Etou, who was born in the Congo, attends Bishop O'Connell High School in Washington, DC, where he's a senior

An investigation by Deadspin.com found several different birthdays listed for Etou, both in 1992, which means he is just months away from his 21st birthday.

The site reported that Etou, whose full name is Luc Tselan Tsiene Etou, has appeared on rosters for three Congo-based teams, which list his birthday as being either June 4, 1992 or April 6, 1992.

The International Basketball Federation (FIBA), the sport's governing body outside of the U.S., told Deadspin that they have Etou's birthday as June 4, 1992.

At 20, Etou is not eligible to play high school basketball - and is as much as six years older than some of his current competitors.

Big man: High school league rules state that a player cannot be older than 18 when going into his or her senior year

It would also make Etou older than nine first round NBA draftees, who each have at least one year of college under their belts.

But as far as Bishop O'Connell is concerned, Etou has every right to be on their court.

Katy Prebble, the school's president, told Deadspin: 'The school has the documentation, including his passport, verifying the age of Junior Etou to be 18.'

Etou's coach, Joe Wootten, did not return a call by Deadspin for comment.

The Deadspin report came just a week after the site broke another huge story in the sports world, the revelation that the story of Notre Dame superstar Manti Te’o’s tragic girlfriend – was a hoax.

The exhaustive investigation found that Te'o had falled to a victim to an elaborate online hoax, allegedly orchestrated by aspiring musician Ronaiah Tuiasosopo.
