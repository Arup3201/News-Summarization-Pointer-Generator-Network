This is the terrifying moment a dedicated community doctor was brutally attacked and run over outside his surgery by a gang of thugs.

Dr Srinivas Rao Dharmana was closing up his practice in Liverpool when a masked gang of five set upon him demanding his Rolex watch and keys to his Audi.

The GP struggled with the robbers and was stabbed twice - which included him being slashed across the face.

Vicious: These CCTV images show the terrifying moment a gang of thugs brutally attacked a dedicated GP just as he left his surgery in Liverpool

Horrifying: Dr Srinivas Rao Dharmana was closing up his practice when the masked gang of five set upon him. He was stabbed twice, saved only by his thick coat

After attacking Dr Dharmana on the ground, the gang then drove the doctor's black Audi TT at him.

He was thrown onto the bonnet as he attempted to stop them just after 7pm on Wednesday outside his surgery on Queens Drive in Walton.

The brave medic has said he refuses to let the 'nightmare' stop him doing his job, and returned to work the day after the brutal attack.

Dr Dharmana, 42, said: 'It's been a nightmare. I just came out of the surgery after the last patients had left and they were waiting.

'They grabbed me and asked for my watch. I tried to battle them off but they tried to stab me twice.'Luckily they didn't manage to because my thick coat stopped it going through.

'One of them slashed my face and another kicked me in the knee to get me to the ground.

'When they drove at me it was terrifying and I was completely shocked by the whole thing. I thought they were going to kill me.

'I normally have a carefree attitude when shutting up the surgery so it's been a real shock to the system.'

The doctor, who has worked at the surgery for seven years, returned to work on Thursday after having hospital treatment on his face.

After the attack, he also had to have an X-ray on his knee after one of the thugs tore ligaments in it after kicking him to the ground.

Nasty: The gang were first pictured on CCTV entering into the grounds of the practice

Planned: The gang waited until Dr Dharmana, 42, walked out of the surgery

He added: 'I'm very cautious now when I'm in the dark alone, but I am not letting them scare me or stop me doing my job. I don't want them to think I was scared.

'They can't drive me away from my job and from helping the community here.'

The father-of-two from Hightown, Merseyside, now hopes CCTV will help police track down the gang.

He said: 'They were clever because they had covered their faces with balaclavas so I don't know how much help the footage will be.

Unprovoked: The robbers demanded his watch and also kicked him in his knee to get him to the ground

Evil: After attacking him on the ground, the gang drove the doctor's black Audi TT at him

'It must have been someone who knew I 
had an expensive watch for them to have asked for that straight away, so
it's possible it is someone I have treated as a patient.'

After the attack the doctor's car was found dumped a mile away from his surgery.

Detective Inspector Martin Earl said:
'Queens Drive is a major route used by pedestrians and motorists alike 
and I would appeal to anyone who may have seen something, or who has 
information which could help us with our inquiries, to contact us.'
