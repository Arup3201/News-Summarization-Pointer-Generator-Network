A Roma gypsy says he is using the £14,000 he has received in benefits to create a lavish house in his homeland.

Ion Lazar boasts that British handouts are funding the refurbishment of the property in the village of Argetoaia in southern Romania.

He said: 'I know the benefit I can make very easily in England. It's coming in benefits. It's like free money, thank you England.'

Proud: Mr Lazar surveys his family home in the village of Argetoaia in southern Romania

Mr Lazar, 36, a part-time self-employed scrap metal collector in London, pays no tax as he earns so little and claims £1,700 a month in welfare. The father-of-three's comments will feature in a Channel 5 documentary to be shown this week.

Ukip MEP Steven Woolfe is furious about the revelation.

He told the Daily Express: 'This is further proof of the national scandal of the abuse of our benefits system caused by our open-door migration policy with the EU.

'We should ban all benefits to immigrants until they have contributed through taxation for at least five years.'

Mr Lazar came to the Britain with five other immigrants when the work restrictions on Romanians were lifted in January.

In April he appeared in another Channel 5 documentary which followed the lives of Roma gipsies in Britain.

In it he admits he is just planning to stash his benefits to take home to his family in Romania.

He added: 'I know it's very, very easy to take benefits in England… She's give me home free, she's give me money free, she's give me everything.'

David Cameron announced last week that he would ban migrants from claiming benefits for four years after moving to Britain.

But he failed to include a controversial 'emergency break' on migration if the benefit cuts did not lead to a fall in the number of EU workers moving to the UK. 

This weekend Labour MP Frank Field warned the debate about immigration in the UK will become 'very nasty' if politicians ignore concerns about the pressures being placed on public services in a time of austerity.

Former minister Mr Field, who co-chairs the cross-party Balanced Migration group, said politicians should be 'tough on the causes of migration' - echoing former prime minister Tony Blair's vow on tackling crime.

 An earlier version of this article said that Mr Lazar had claimed £60,000 in benefits. In fact, Mr Lazar stated that he hoped to collect £60,000 in benefits during his first two to three years in the UK, and claimed to have collected approximately £14,000 during his first 11 months in the UK. We are happy to clarify this.
