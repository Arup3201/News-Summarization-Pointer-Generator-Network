A woman whose unborn child and husband were killed in a car accident last year is now set to face the man behind the wheel.

Graye Coody was high on bath salts when his SUV went flying and rammed into Monchelle Garley and her family.

Her husband Charles was putting air in the tires of their car inside a Houston garage when Coody's car rammed into their vehicle last April.

Heartbroken: Monchelle Garley (pictured) is due to face her husband and unborn child's killer today when he pleads guilty to intoxicated manslaughter and is sentenced to an expected 10 years behind bars

A different path: Mrs Garley, seen with her husband Charles before the April 2013 crash, said that her life has been forever changed by the accident

'My life has been completely altered. I will never be the same,' Mrs Garley told local station KHOU.

Coody, who is now 19-years-old, is due in court today to plead guilty to intoxicated manslaughter and accept a 10 year prison sentence.

Mrs Garley will have a chance to address him in the courtroom.

'I can’t tell you how it will feel,' she said on Monday.

'This is a road I haven’t travelled before.'

The entire accident was caught on surveillance footage which shows Coody's car fly through the air and slamming directly into the Garley's car.

Facing his crimes: Graye Coody, who is now 19-years-old, is expected to be sentenced to 10 years in prison when he enters his guilty plea in a Houston court on Tuesday

There reportedly were two of Coody's friends in the car who tried to restrain him and stop him from taking the wheel but they were unsuccessful.

'It’s not worth it in the end. Really, is a 10 or 15 minute high worth taking someone’s life? Is it worth the possibility of going to jail?'
