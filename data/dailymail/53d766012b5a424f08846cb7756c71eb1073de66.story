Here’s something you will never hear: West Ham manager Sam Allardyce saying anything which might be misconstrued as negative about his captain Kevin Nolan.

These two are inseparable, - they’ve served each other very well in their careers. But on Saturday they ganged up together like the school bullies.

I don’t think these two realise the damage they’ve potentially done.

I was at Old Trafford on Saturday and I could see how frustrated Nolan was when his late goal was ruled out for offside.

This is a Liverpool fan scoring an equaliser at Manchester United remember – that flag must have sliced right through Nolan’s heart.

But that doesn’t give him or Sam the right to then behave like social media trolls, encouraging at best ridicule and at worst venom from the West Ham fans towards officials.

Allardyce said the official 'dropped a massive bo**ock'. For a start, that is no way for the manager of a great club like West Ham to be speaking in a post-match press conference. Secondly, the linesman’s decision was correct, so if a bo**ock was dropped, it was Sam who dropped it.

Nolan said the linesman 'gambled'. That’s a hell of an accusation – and I would dare to suggest Nolan will be a lucky man if the official decides not to seek an apology for such a slur on his professionalism.

Nolan then dropped his own 'bo**ock' by saying that the official 'can’t have seen it, because if he had seen it he wouldn’t have given offside'.

It’s a worry that a Premier League manager and a Premier League captain do not know the laws of the game of football. And it’s a disgrace when the pair of them team up like a pair of sneaky ill-informed grasses to ridicule an official, and accuse him of guessing at decisions.

Allardyce scoffed at the decision, saying if Nolan’s head was offside then the linesman must be 'superhuman' with 'x-ray vision'.

No Sam, it was just someone doing his job brilliantly. You should watch and learn.
