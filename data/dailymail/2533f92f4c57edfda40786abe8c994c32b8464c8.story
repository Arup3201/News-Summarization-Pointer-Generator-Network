The Football Association have confirmed they are considering taking the Community Shield abroad.

The revelation comes  after Arsenal beat Manchester City 3-0 in the Community Shield final in front of  71,523 people at Wembley - almost 20,000 shy of capacity and nearly 40,000 less than the attendance for Manchester United vs Real Madrid in the United States in pre-season.

Alex Horne, the FA's general secretary, said: 'It's an interesting idea and, obviously, we've seen the NFL do something similar with their games coming to Wembley.

'The NBA are doing it and we know that Spanish football and Italian football are looking at doing that with their own Supercup-type games.'

Any move overseas, though, would have to wait until 2018 as Horne acknowledged the Community Shield has a deal with Wembley until that year. 

'It's an interesting opportunity,' continued Horne, as reported by The Times. 'But, as I say, right now we've got a contract with Wembley and the fans and the players enjoy playing at Wembley.'

It comes a week after Paris Saint-Germain beat fellow Ligue 1 side Guingamp 2-0 in the Trophee des Champions - also known as the French Super Cup - at the Workers Stadium in Beijing.

Pre-season has seen Premier League teams circle the globe, with Man United, Liverpool and Arsenal's tours of the US among the most lucrative.

United and Real's pre-season game saw Louis van Gaal emerge a 3-1 winner in front of 109,318 fans at the so-called Big House in Michigan. Comparatively, Sunday's Community Shield final saw City sell just 18,000 of their 25,000 allocation.

The game saw just three Englishmen - all Arsenal players - feature in either starting XI at the home of English football. The trio included Kieran Gibbs, Calum Chambers and Jack Wilshere.
