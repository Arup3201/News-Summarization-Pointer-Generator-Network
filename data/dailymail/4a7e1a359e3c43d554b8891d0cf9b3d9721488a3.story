A police officer was killed and four others seriously injured when two helicopters crashed into each other during a riot training exercise above Berlin's Olympic Stadium.

Both vehicles were reduced to fiery hulks when they smashed into a field adjoining the stadium during a snowstorm.  Reports suggest that the vehicles flew too close to one another while one was descending and their rotors clashed.

The helicopters, thought to be carrying up to 25 police officers each, were taking part in a training exercise dealing with football violence and crowd control.

Devastation: Two crashed helicopters on the field of the Olympic Stadium in Berlin

Response: Police officers rush to the scene after the crash in which one police officer died and another four were seriously injured

Football ground: The Olympic Stadium in Berlin is also home to the Hertha Berlin Bundesliga football club

Exercise: The two helicopters can be seen lying beside each other. The officers are believed to have been taking part in a football violence and crowd control exercise

The Olympic Stadium, which is now home to the Hertha Berlin Bundesliga football club, was the focal point of the Olympic Games in 1936, dubbed Hitler's Games. It also hosted the World Cup final in 2006.

Fireworks were reportedly being let off to create riot conditions when the collision occurred.  One pilot was pictured walking away from the wreckage of his craft with blood streaming down his face from a head wound.

As well as the serious injuries and fatality, media reports spoke of 'many others' being hurt.

The crash between the Puma helicopters happened at 10.40am this morning. Some 400 police officers were on the ground and dashed to the nearby fields to help their stricken comrades when they saw the aircraft go down in flames.

Reports suggest that the crash happened when one helicopter was preparing to land and 
did not notice the other beneath it.

The machines were no more than 
100 feet off the ground when they collided, while it is understood that the dead pilot 
was at the controls of the lower aircraft.

Alex Lier, a reporter for the Bild newspaper who was at the scene, said: 'Everyone is in shock. Three helicopters were airborne in a real snowstorm. 

'Then one heard a loud bang and someone shouted: 'Everyone get down!' There was blood and wreckage everywhere.'

The helicopters are part of a fleet operated by the Federal Police - the national force - as opposed to the local Berlin police.  An immediate inquiry is underway into the cause of the crash as local hospitals deal with the casualties.

One of the helicopter pilots died at 
the scene, fire service spokesman Stephan Fleischer said, who confirmed 
that five people were injured, four of them seriously.

A female police officer is among the four severely wounded in the crash.

Disaster: There were 25 police officers in each of the Puma helicopters, with reports suggesting they flew too close to each other

Injuries: One of the injured officers is helped away from the scene. Reports suggested that 'many more' had been injured

Federal Police spokesman Frank 
Brochert confirmed there 'was an incident during an exercise' and that 
emergency crews were on the scene. He had no details about the accident.

Fire
service spokesman Sven Gerling said his initial information was that 
two helicopters crashed, but he had no further details on the accident.

It was not immediately clear whether the injured people were in the helicopters, Mr Fleischer said.

Pictures from the scene showed one of
the helicopters lying on its side in the snow in a field behind the 
stadium and the other next to it, still upright.

Eyewitness Johannes Malinowski said 
on n-tv television that he saw three helicopters approaching and that 
the snow on the field was being kicked up by the aircraft, so 'you 
couldn't see a whole lot anymore'.

There was then 'a big bang' he said, 'and then we looked up and there was blood on the ground'.

The training exercise being conducted was thought to have related to football violence.

Germany's main police union is calling for clarification why the training exercise was green-lighted when the weather was so bad in Berlin.

The president of the GdP union said: 'We need answers.  But immediately our sympathies and concern lie with the survivors and for the family of the dead officer.  We wish a speedy and full recovery to our injured colleagues.'

The Olympic Stadium in West Berlin was constructed in 1936

Training: There are thought to have been a further 400 officers from the Federal Police on the ground during the exercise

Confusion: Fireworks had been let off inside the stadium to recreate the atmosphere of a riot, according to some reports

Wreckage: Eyewitness Johannes Malinowski said on n-tv television that he saw three helicopters approaching and that the snow on the field was being kicked up by the aircraft, so 'you couldn't see a whole lot anymore'

The design and construction of the Olympic Stadium in Berlin was overseen by Nazi ruler Adolf Hitler, which was the focal point of the Olympic Games in 1936.

German athletes won more gold medals than any other nation at the tournament, prompting Hitler to say that when the war was won, every Olympic Games would take place in Germany.

After the Games Hitler told Albert Speer, an architect and later his Armaments Minister who worked on the original stadium, 
to produce blueprints for a new stadium seating 400,000 people.

Despite its modern remodelling, including a roof and moveable 
seating, the stadium is recognisably the same as that which hosted the 1936 Games.

The Games represented the one arena in which Hitler's ambition to 
rule victorious over the rest of the civilised world would actually be 
accomplished, albeit only in the world of athletics.

The stadium is the biggest and best-preserved example of Nazi 
architecture in Berlin, and was built as an expression of German might.

Hitler opened the Games on August 1, 1936, between two tall, imposing
stone towers which look like fortified turrets, with the five rings of 
the Olympic symbol strung between them.

That summer's day, conscious that he cut a rather sorry figure in 
civilian dress, Hitler wore his usual brown uniform with a peaked cap, 
baggy trousers, knee-length leather boots and swastika armband.

He walked beneath a 220ft-high stone belltower, its 
nine-and-a-half-ton bell inscribed, in Gothic letters, 'I call to the 
Youth of the World'.

A special truck had pulled it slowly across Germany to Berlin, 
greeted throughout its journey with military parades, bands and 
speeches.

As Hitler marched slowly between the Olympic teams gathered just 
outside on the vast open space of the May Field, he was filmed by the 
camera teams of his favourite director, Leni Riefenstahl.

From three miles away, loudspeakers positioned along his route had been intoning: 'He is coming. He is coming.'

When he entered the stadium and ascended to the Ehrentribune, or seat
of honour, Hitler was greeted by a sea of swastikas and a thunderous 
roar of adulation from the capacity crowd of  110,000 people.

As the national teams marched past, the French were greeted with a 
huge ovation for giving the Nazi salute, while the British, who refused 
to give the salute, performing instead a military-style 'eyes right', 
were received almost in silence.

Despite the existence of concentration camps and brutal treatement of
Jews in Germany, with the exception of Stalin's Russia, who were not 
invited, none of the Olympic teams chose to boycott Hitler's Games.

A few individual athletes pulled out, but the prevailing sentiment 
was summed up by the British gold medallist sprinter Harold Abrahams, 
himself Jewish, who said: 'If the British team goes to Berlin, it will 
be an influence for the good.'

his was despite the fact that, since 1933, Jewish sportsmen and women
had been largely excluded from competing, except among themselves.

Under pressure from the International Olympic Committee, the Germans 
unwillingly allowed a couple of Jews, both women, to train for the 
Olympics, though only one was permitted to participate.
