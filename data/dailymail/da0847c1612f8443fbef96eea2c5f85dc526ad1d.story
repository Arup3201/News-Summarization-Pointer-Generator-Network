It's a tiresome insult that Welsh people have endured for years.

Now an Englishman on holiday in Wales has been convicted of racism for using the phrase.

Anthony Taaffe was fined £150 after calling security staff at a holiday park ‘a bunch of sheep s******s’.

'Racism': Anthony Taaffe, 47, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, was fined £150 after calling a group of people at a holiday park in Wales 'sheep s******s'

The 47-year-old claims he was using the term to describe ‘people living in the countryside’.

At a special weekend court in Llandudno, North Wales, he admitted to racially aggravated disorderly behaviour.

The court was told that on Thursday 
last week Taaffe appeared drunk and had been shouting and swearing at 
staff at Presthaven Sands holiday park at Gronant, near Prestatyn.

Defence: Taaffe argued 'sheep s*****r' is a term for people in the countryside

Prosecutor Gareth Parry said he was annoyed about having property stolen from his  holiday home.

A Welsh off-duty police officer told Taaffe to calm down but the defendant responded by saying ‘f*** off’.

Security staff intervened but Taaffe became more aggravated and called them a ‘bunch of sheep s******s’.

Police were informed and arrested 
him. Court chairman Rod Bowden told him that his language, in front of 
children, had been ‘unacceptable’.

Taaffe, from Bolton, also pleaded 
guilty to a second similar offence when he called an officer at the 
police custody unit a ‘Welsh sheep s******’. Phillip Lloyd Jones, 
defending, said Taaffe – who has epilepsy and receives benefits – was 
holidaying, and that he was being 
restrained on the ground when he made the remark.

In November last year, a woman who 
described her neighbour as ‘a stupid fat  Australian’, was fined £110 
for racially aggravated public disorder.

Czech-born Petra Mills, 31, of 
Monmouth, South Wales, flung the insult at New Zealander Chelsea 
O’Reilly during a drunken tirade.

In 2011 Coventry postman Darren Swain
was convicted of racially aggravated criminal damage after scrawling 
graffiti at a sorting office in which he called Scottish tennis player 
Andy Murray a ‘useless Jock’.

Coventry Magistrates’ Court ordered Swain to carry out 200 hours of community work and pay £3,000 in costs.
