A mother’s heart-warming letter in support of her son coming out as gay has gone viral.

Michelle Conway McClain penned the note after finding out that her son Zach had come via a post on Facebook.

The healthcare counselor from Union, Missouri wrote how proud she was of his decision – and told him to clean up his room.

Full support: Michelle Conway McClain did not have a chance to speak to her son before she left for work, so penned him a note to tell him how proud she was that he had the courage to come out as bisexual

A mother's love: After Zach came out on Facebook, Michelle Conway McClain penned this response and put it on his bedroom door

The note reads: ‘Zach,

'I
was surprised by your Facebook post where you came out. I want you to 
know that I love you unconditionally.

'I love you with my actions, not 
just my words. I’m so proud of you. You are the bravest person I know. I’ll fight for you always. Your sexual orientation does not define you.

'You
are still the boy who forever won my heart. The only thing that 
concerns me is the number of empty soda cups and tea bottles in your 
room. Throw them away before ants come inside.

'I love you always - Mom’

Going viral: Ms Conway McClain's note has been shared all around the world and she thanked her supporters on her Facebook page

She posted a photograph of the letter on her Facebook page with the explanatory comment: ‘I didn't get to talk to him before I left for work today, so I left this on his bedroom door,’ after which it was spread across all corners of the internet.

Commenting on a re-post of the letter on Have a Gay Day’s Facebook page, Ms Conway McClain confirmed the authenticity of her loving words.

‘This note is not fake,’ she writes. ‘I wrote it to my son on the morning of 8/30/13 when I read on Facebook before work that he came out as bisexual.

'And I meant every word. I'm so proud of him!’
