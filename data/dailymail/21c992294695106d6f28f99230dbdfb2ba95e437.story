From clear blue skies to a total whiteout, this is the nerve-racking moment a snowboarder gets caught up in an avalanche and lives to tell the tale.

Sorin Radu, a winter sports instructor from Bucharest, Romania, was on an off-piste area of the Parâng Mountains when the potentially fatal incident occurred.

Footage captured by a GoPro helmet camera shows the snow suddenly cracking up below Radu's feet before an whole section of icy ground dramatically gives way.

Radu is forced to the ground and rolls over with the force.

The film turns from pitch black to brilliant white as the snow rapidly washes over the lens.

A jet of icy smoke is left in the avalanche's trail.

Radu barely utters a word as he's swept away by the snowy wave.

Calm before the storm: From clear blue skies to total whiteout, this is the nerve-racking moment a snowboarder gets caught up in an avalanche and lives to tell the tale

Caught on camera: Sorin Radu, a winter sports instructor from Bucharest, Romania, was on an off-piste area of the Parâng Mountains when the potentially fatal incident occurred

Shattered: Footage captured by a GoPro helmet camera he was wearing shows the snow suddenly cracking up below his feet before an entire section of icy ground dramatically gives way

Swept away: Radu is forced to the ground and rolls over with the force

After 20 seconds or so, he gradually reaches a standstill. 

Shots taken after the avalanche show that he let go of his snowboard and backpack, maybe to reduce his weight.

Radu was snowboarding at an elevation of 2135 meters before he took a tumble.

It is not known if he sustained any long-lasting injuries. 

However, a shot he took of himself after the accident shows him smiling at the camera, signaling 'I'm OK.'

Camera angle: The film turns from pitch black to brilliant white as the snow rapidly washes over the lens

Misty views: A jet of icy smoke is left in the avalanche's trail

Shock and awe: Radu barely uttered a word when the snowy wave swept him away

Putting the brakes on: It 20 seconds or so before the snowboarder reached a standstill

All smiles: It's not known if Radu sustained any cuts or bruises
