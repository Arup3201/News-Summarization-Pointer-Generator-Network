New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's crusade to rid the City of all things unhealthy has taken aim at various fattening foods and harmful products like cigarettes and trans fats. He even once tried - and failed - to ban large containers of soda within New York's five boroughs.

But Bloomberg's now gone a step further - not only does hizzonor not want you to smoke cigarettes, he doesn't want you smoke fake cigarettes, either.  

Recently leaked drafts of three tobacco-related bills that are expected to be introduced into the City Council indicate that Bloomberg's planning to regulate e-cigs into extinction.

The bills are written to include stricter regulations on all tobacco products by doing things like raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco products from 18 to 21. The plan also would prohibit the display of cigarette advertising in stores and create a $10.50 price floor for cigarette 
packs. It also would prohibit the use of tobacco coupons and increase fines against those selling illegal cigarettes.

So e-cigs - which contain absolutely no tobacco - wouldn't be included, right?

Wrong - according to the 
Consumer Advocates for Smoke-Free Alternatives Association, the bills 
would also classify e-cigs as 'tobacco products' so they would be 
included with regular tobacco for the sake of the stricter regulations.

It's yet to be determined whether e-cigs are safer than cigarettes. They don't contain tar or tobacco, but they aren't simply water vapor and nicotine, as e-cig manufacturers would want you to believe.

The
Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about e-cigs 
in 2009, noting that some samples contained ingredients found in anti-freeze.
The agency determined that they could not approved by the FDA, and would not be deemed safe without further testing.

Additionally, critics of e-cigs argue that they have no no purpose other than to perpetuate nicotine addiction.

However, a study released this month by Drexel University concluded that the chemicals in e-cigs are not harmful to users or those in their proximity.

Regardless, for the purposes of the new tobacco bills, they contain precisely zero tobacco.

Safe? It's yet to be determined whether e-cigs are safe. They are not FDA approved but studies show they aren't harmful

Dr. Michael Siegel, a professor of Community Health Sciences at the Boston University School of Public Health, is a supporter of e-cigs and believes Bloomberg's proposals 'would be a public health disaster.'

'I have no problems with this ordinance as a whole—raising the age, 
banning advertising. But [electronic-cigarettes] are a product that's 
literally saving people's lives, people who are literally at risk of 
disease and death, and giving them an alternative,' Siegel told Gothamist.

'What are these people gonna do?'

Under the new legislation, e-cigs would be considered tobacco products and subject to the same level of regulation
