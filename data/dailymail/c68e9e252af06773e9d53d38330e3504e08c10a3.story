A 5-year-old boy who swallowed a battery when he was just a toddler is finally able to speak and breathe on his own again.

Emmett Rauch of Peoria, Arizona had to undergo 65 surgeries over the course of four years, but after all that he is finally living the life of every other kid his age.

This after Emmett ingested the lithium battery from a DVD remote which shut off his airway and burned his esophagus.

NBC 4 reports that Emmett had his tracheotomy tube removed in December, after a long battle that at times seemed impossible.

'I mean he can go and be a little boy and not have this thing sticking out of his neck,' said his mother Karla.

'He is relearning how to swallow and can almost eat a whole piece of pizza.'

And now, after all they have gone through, Emmett's parents have teamed with Safe Kids and National Poison Control to raise awareness about the dangers presented by batteries.

Emmett had four inches of his esophagus removed after the acid from the battery burned two holes through it. 

He has also suffered multiple cases of collapsed lung and had close to 200 X-rays before he was even 2-years-old.

The batteries are so dangerous because they don't have as much casing as an AA battery.

A nurse who cared for Emmett, Michelle Chacon, said she has seen several cases of children swallowing batteries and that more should be done to make families aware of the household danger.

The nurse has helped the Rauch family set up a charity to raise awareness about the tiny batteries which are used in everyday objects like clocks, cameras and calculators.

Ms Chacon said: 'You talk about childproofing your home and covering your outlets, and this needs to be a part of that.'

According to the National Capital Poison Center, each year in the U.S. more than 3,500 people swallow miniature disc or button batteries.
