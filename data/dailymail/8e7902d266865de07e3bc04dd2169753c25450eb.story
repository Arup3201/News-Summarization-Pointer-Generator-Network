As a species they are notorious for their scavenging nature, so it's no surprise that this fox attempted a smash and grab raid on a Golden Eagle's lunch.

But the less than wily creature is outfoxed by the giant bird of prey as it digs its claws in and defends its meal.

The plucky fox was clearly willing to put up a fight to make sure he had his share of the eagle's spoils - but was eventually overpowered by the enormous bird.

Attack: Yves Adams stunning photo captured the moment a Golden Eagle dug its claws in to the not so wily fox that tried to steal his lunch

Scrap: The fox fights back baring its teeth at the angry eagle

Fight: The plucky fox is knocked to the ground as the tussle between the two animals continues

The dramatic face-off was captured on camera by Belgian photographer Yves Adams, as the animals fought in the snow and freezing temperatures - which plummeted to -20C - in Bulgaria.

He had been laying patiently in wait to capture shots of vultures which the Bulgarian Government has recently reintroduced into the wild but instead came away with these magnificent stills.

Yves said: 'I had been photographing the vultures and an eagle eating from the carrion for about an hour.

'The eagle was getting stuffed and the Ravens started to give up their harassing, when suddenly something reddish came over the ridge, behind the eagle, too blurred for me to see through my low depth of field 600mm lens.

'But what happened then was incredible - a red fox came down to the feeding station, to grab some meat, but the Golden eagle wasn't really pleased with that and chased the poor fox away!

'I could hardly hold my joy when I saw most of the shots were pin-sharp and both animals had great expressions! I was really lucky to had my complete set-up in the perfect settings.

'I had never been to Bulgaria before, but after this experience, I know I had been waiting too long to discover the beautiful country.'

It is hardly a surprise the one of the world's most famous birds of prey came out on top at the end of the scrap - it is one of the most powerful predators in the avian world and has an impressive wingspan of up to 7.7ft.
