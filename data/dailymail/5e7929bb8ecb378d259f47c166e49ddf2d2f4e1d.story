The father of former EastEnders actress Gemma McCluskie walked out of court today as details were given about how her body was hacked up by her brother.

Tony McCluskie senior had sat through most of the evidence but decided to leave as further details were given about how she was cut into six pieces.

Son Tony McCluskie, 35, admits killing the 29-year-old in March last year but claims he has no memory of it.

Miss McCluskie’s torso was found in a suitcase in the Regent’s Canal in east London, followed by her limbs in plastic bags.

Her head turned up six months later and she was officially identified by dental records.

The prosecution said pot-smoking 
McCluskie bludgeoned his sister to death in the flat they shared after a
 row about an overflowing sink.

Miss McCluskie played Kerry Skinner, the niece of Ethel Skinner, in the BBC soap in 2001.

Professor Sue Black, an expert on 
dismemberment from the University of Dundee, said her bones had 95 marks
 where they had been cut or hacked.

She said the killer had used a knife but switched to a meat cleaver when he was not successful.

She said it would have taken an experienced person an hour but anyone else could have taken up to three hours or more.

In total there were 56 knife cuts and 39 hacking injuries to the body.

Pathologist Dr Simon Poole told the court Miss McCluskie died from being hit over the head with an object such as a bat.

She also had a number of bruises on her body from before she died. Some looked like finger marks from someone grabbing her.

McCluskie, of Shoreditch, east London, denies murder at the Old Bailey. The trial was adjourned to tomorrow.
