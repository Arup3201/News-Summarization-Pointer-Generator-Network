Police are searching for the former tenants of an abandoned Brisbane home after explosives were found on Wednesday night.

A police spokesman told Daily Mail Australia that a real estate agent attended the property for inspection and had stumbled across suspicious items before raising the alarm.

An emergency situation was declared at 8.22pm when a large amount of explosives, chemicals and drug paraphernalia were found at a property on Red Cedar Road in Pullenvale.

Bomb disposal experts carried out two controlled explosives overnight and will examine the scene to determine the explosives are stable enough to be moved.

The street has been blocked off for more than 11 hours to detonate explosives and will continue  searching the property through to 4.30pm Thursday.

Nearby residents were warned to remain inside their homes and take precautions.

Acting Inspector Mark Bradford told 612 ABC Radio that police then arrived at the scene and found the explosives in a detached shed.

'Sometimes in situations like this the safest method of disposal...is for a controlled detonation to occur,' Acting Inspector Bradford said.

'Throughout the course of today, the scene will be further examined by specialist police and we’ll go from there in terms of what we’ll actually find.

'This is one of those situations where until we are able to properly search the shed and surrounding areas, I can’t give you a timeframe other than to say any affected residents will be continually updated.'

Neighbours told 9NEWS that it was unusual for the suburban street.

'It’s a bit surprising, considering we have little kids on the street,' one man said.

Only residents in Red Cedar Road between the Lilly Pilly Road intersection up to the roundabout with White Cedar Road are affected.
