Twitter is often used as a barometer for the popularity of celebrities and has even been used to predict flu outbreaks.

Now the social network has revealed when people were late for work and horribly hungover - which could perhaps be used to spot patterns in the future.

The study revealed when people were the most late for work and when they were happiest in 2013.

Running late: The statistics showed that the most common day that people were late for work was mid-week in July and on Fridays in January

Twitter analysed the use of different English words and phrases in 2013 on a daily basis to find that people were particularly hungover on Fridays in November and at their saddest on a Sunday in December.

Experts at the San Francisco-based company turned the data into a ratio of tweets containing certain words in English per million tweets posted to create colourful charts showing that many of us tweet the same words on the same day.

Arguably proving that plenty of people dread the working week ahead, Twitter’s research found that people are more likely to tweet ‘feeling sad’ on a Sunday in December and that Mondays really are tough, particularly on a chilly day in October.

Sunday in March and Thursdays and Fridays in November are the days that most people were hungover, according to the study and data visualisations

Conversely, people were happiest on a Tuesday in December and January, which happened to be New Year’s Eve, according to the blog post by Simon Rogers, Data Editor at the social network.

The statistics showed that the most common days that people were late for work fell in the middle of the week in July and on Fridays in January.

Meanwhile, Sunday in March and Thursdays and Fridays in November are the days that most people were hungover, according to the study and data visualisations.

Twitter might be best known as the place to go for day-to-day updates about people’s lives and celebrity selfies, but it could also be used as a health tool, researchers claim.

Geography experts discovered in December that posts on the social network predicted flu outbreaks in different parts of the U.S.

They believe Twitter could help medical professionals learn where and when severe flu outbreaks are occurring in real time so they can prepare for busy periods, which typically occur during the winter months.

The researchers, led by San Diego State University geography professor Ming-Hsiang Tsou, examined tweets that originated from a 17 mile radius of 11 different U.S. cities between June and December 2012.

Whenever people tweeted the keywords ‘flu’ or ‘influenza,’ a computer programme recorded characteristics about the tweets, including the username and location of the people who sent them as well as whether they were original tweets or retweets and whether they linked to a website.

From June 2012 to the beginning of December, the algorithm recorded 161,821 tweets containing the word ‘flu’ and 6,174 containing ‘influenza’.

The researchers compared the location data of those tweets to data on the flu virus rates recorded in the relevant cities and counties.

They discovered that of the 11 cities where tweets were examined, there was a ‘significant’ correlation between tweets about flu and the rates of flu-like illnesses in nine of the cities.

Twitter also seemed to be able to predict outbreaks in five of the cities: San Diego, Denver, Jacksonville, Fort Worth and Seattle, as the tweets recorded instances of illness before they were officially documented and reported by cities and counties.
