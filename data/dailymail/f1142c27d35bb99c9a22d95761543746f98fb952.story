The flawless looks unveiled on the Oscars red carpet last night weren't just the result of a few brushes of bronzer; they have been months in the making and require an army of well-trained experts.

With perhaps the highest concentration of cameras anywhere in the world and millions of viewers keenly critiquing every single attendee's look, getting it right on the red carpet is essential.

Stars such as Rita Ora, Lupita Nyong'o and Reese Witherspoon looked picture perfect as they faced a gauntlet of flashbulbs. But, however genetically blessed they may be, you can be sure they didn't wake up looking that flawless.

Rita Ora proved you can do red carpet beauty on a budget by using a £4.49 eyeshadow stick by drugstore brand, Rimmel, as seen in her behind the scenes snaps

From make-up artists to nail technicians - and a few budget beauty secrets along the way - the A-listers called in their loyal team of experts who worked like a well-oiled machine to ensure that they were ready for their close ups. Here, FEMAIL reveals their Oscars beauty secrets...

Lupita Nyong'o's beauty look came courtesy of Lancome's Nick Barose (she is the face of the brand, after all).

The inspiration behind her look? 'A modern take on 20s glamour,' said Nick.

He gave Lupita a metallic, smokey eye paired with a romantic aubergine lip. The French beauty giant put their new Miracle Cushion to the test ob Lupita's skin and used Hypnose Kohl Waterproof on her eyes (a product the Duchess of Cambridge is said to be a huge fan of).

As for her hair, stylist Larry Sims used all natural products to achieve that glossy finish. He washed her hair with Smooth ‘N Shine Smooth Olive & Tea Tree RevivOil Wrap and Set Mousse to create the pretty ringlets.

Burberry custom designed a gown for model and actress, Suki Waterhouse, who is a friend of the brand

Suki Waterhouse also gave some new beauty products a spin on the red carpet. The Burberry Beauty ambassadress wore Burberry Make-up, of course, and previewed Burberry Kisses, a new lipstick collection launching next month.

Her entire look came courtesy of the British fashion house's beauty range. Want to glow like Suki? Apply Fresh Glow Fluid Foundation and Fresh Glow Luminous Fluid Base to emulate her dewy skin. Burberry, who will showcase their AW15 designs at London Fashion Week today, also custom designed a gown for the model and actress.

Rita Ora took a leaf out of Puff Daddy's book by de-puffing her eyes with cooling patches ahead of the event (a trick the rapper debuted on Instagram at last year's event).

The young starlet may be worth millions but she proved you can do red carpet beauty on a budget by using a £4.49 eyeshadow stick by drugstore brand, Rimmel.

Lady Gaga also treated herself to a spot of pampering by having an in-room massage - and her dog, Asia, even got in on the action by having a pooch pampering session.

Chloë Grace Moretz, a presenter at the 87th Annual Academy Awards, was treated to a makeover by celebrity makeup artist Mai Quynh, who created a 'fresh and youthful' look.

Quynh was inspired by the colours of Moretz's dress and handbag, and selected a colour palette to complement them.

Quynh first prepped the skin with RéVive Sensitif Renewal Cream Daily Cellular Protection Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen to ensure it was properly moisturised before using exclusively Laura Mercier products to give her that red carpet glow.

Reese Witherspoon was given a similar look using Laura Mercier products. Celebrity makeup artist Molly R. Stern created a 'radiant, sexy and effortless' look for Best Actress in a Leading Role nominee, Reese.

Keira Knightley's hair was coiffed to perfection by stylist Ben Skervin, who used Fekkai Soleil Beach Waves Tousling Spray to add extra texture to her locks. She accessorised with a Chanel hair piece

Stern, who described the experience of working with Witherspoon for the Oscars as 'an honour akin to winning a trophy,' combined a sun-kissed glow with a fresh and neutral colour palette. 

Stern began by spreadingSt.Tropez Instant Tan Lotion Light/Medium on Witherspoon’s décolletage and arms to create a 'rich golden base for her skin.'

To prep the face, she first massaged RéVive Intensité Moisture Serum Extrême Complete Hydration, to recharge Witherspoon’s face and give it a boost of extra hydration. She lightly applied RéVive Intensité Crème Lustre Day Firming Moisture Cream Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen to give the skin a dewy luminosity.

Stern then applied Laura Mercier Silk Crème Moisturising Photo Edition Foundation to ensure her complexion was 'natural and fresh-looking.' She used a shade darker than usual to give the actress’ skin a 'warmed up sun-smooched feeling.'

Using Tom Ford Shade & Illuminate Highlighter & Shader Duet in Intensity One, Stern defined Witherspoon’s bone structure by darkening the hollows of her cheeks. Then, she applied blusher on the apples of her cheeks to create a 'soft, subtle flush.' 

For Witherspoon’s eyes, Stern shaded and softly smoked them out with nude tones all over the lids, blending into the crease to create depth without darkness. 

For the final touch of glamour on the eyes, Stern curled the actress’ eyelashes and coated her lashes twice. To give the lashes a softer intensity, she painted highlights into the lashes using a brown mascara.

Keira Knightley, meanwhile, had a radiant pregnancy glow. Her ethereal hair was coiffed to perfection by stylist Ben Skervin, who used Fekkai Soleil Beach Waves Tousling Spray to add extra texture to her locks.

American Sniper star and Oscar presenter Sienna Miller stunned on the red carpet tonight with an 'Old Hollywood,' 1960s Audrey Hepburn-inspired makeup look created by Charlotte Tilbury

Choosing the perfect dress is only half of the equation when it comes to impressing on the red carpet; a flawless face is key, too. And that's where beauty guru Charlotte Tilbury comes in.

The British make-up artist is Hollywood's go-to guru when it comes to getting awards season-ready.

Charlotte, who is Kate Moss, Kim Kardashian and Amal Clooney's make-up artist of choice, was on hand to beautify Sienna Miller, Rachel Roy, Jessica Hart, Laura Bailey and Poppy Delevingne. 

American Sniper star and Oscar presenter Sienna Miller stunned on the red carpet tonight with an 'Old Hollywood,' 1960s Audrey Hepburn-inspired makeup look. Together, Sienna worked collaboratively with her long-time friend that she has proclaimed as being the 'queen of the cat eye' to kick her glamorous look, driven by her Oscar de la Renta gown, into high gear. 

Charlotte Tilbury applied her Goddess Skin Clay Mask, a product that Charlotte says 'is the key to shrinking pores and tightening the skin, leaving you with a perfectly dewy, plumped and revived red carpet glow.'

Charlotte also beautified Poppy Delevingne for the after party 

Charlotte’s Magic Cream - Charlotte’s 'secret to red carpet skin' - and Wonderglow were applied to hydrate the skin and create a soft-focus which is 'amazing for HDTV

Charlotte then applied Light Wonder Foundation in 6 Medium and 7 Medium, then the Retoucher Concealer in 2 Fair under the eyes and 3 Medium for the rest of Sienna’s face

Charlotte used her new Goddess Skin Clay Mask on the likes of Jessica Hart, a product that Charlotte says 'is the key to shrinking pores and tightening the skin, leaving you with a perfectly dewy, plumped and revived red carpet glow'

Next, Airbrush Powder Flawless Finish Powder in 1 Fair and 2 Medium was applied only to the T-Zone to control shine while keeping from taking away from the dewiness on the rest of the skin

To enhance Sienna’s eyebrows, Charlotte used Brow Lift in Grace K and Cara D. Rock ‘N’ Kohl Eye Pencil in Bedroom Black and The Feline Flick Quick Fine Line Shodo Pen were used over the lash line to dramatically define the eyes.

Using her Eye Smudger Brush and The Eyeshadow Luxury Palette in The Sophisticate, and Full Fat Lashes, Charlotte accentuated Sienna’s 'winged' eyes, focusing on the crease and lash line areas

To enhance the cheekbones, Charlotte applied Filmstar Bronze & Glow with the Powder & Sculpt Brush, following the hollows of the cheeks and along the jaw line with the bronzer and applying the highlighter shade to the top of the cheekbones

To further accentuate Sienna’s features, Beach Sticks in Moonbeach and Ibiza were used to illuminate and sculpt.

To prep the lips, Charlotte used Lip Love Lip Scrub and Lip Magic. Charlotte Tilbury Lip Cheat Lip Liner in Pillow Talk was applied to mimic the pigment of Sienna’s lips and filled in with K.I.S.S.I.N.G Lipstick in Bitch Perfect

For an all over glow, Charlotte applied Supermodel Body all over Sienna’s limbs

Most stars go on a health kick ahead of awards season to keep their skin glowing and spots at bay - but not Lily Allen.

The British songstress shared a somewhat refreshing snap of her pre-Oscars meal of fried chicken and potatoes on social media ahead of the event. 

The atmosphere at the 87th Annual Academy Awards at Hollywood & Highland Center was electric on Sunday

The 87th Annual Academy Awards were a stellar success as they were announced in Los Angeles on Sunday evening. Continuing his clean sweep of awards season, emotional Eddie Redmayne was almost too choked to speak as he picked up Best Actor for his portrayal of physicist Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything.

Birdman was the big winner of the night, scooping the prestigious Best Picture Oscar. The comedy drama swooped off with a total of four prizes - a number that tied with The Grand Budapest Hotel - including Best Director and Best Original Screenplay. 

Elsewhere, Julianne Moore was equally overwhelmed as Redmayne when she was named Best Actress for her role in Still Alice.
