GIFs have taken over the internet, entertaining millions with their short and often amusing animations.

But the viral picture format has, up until now, been trapped in digital form.

Now a project is planning to liberate the GIF from the internet using a technology invented in the 1940s.

Brooklyn-based designers Sha Hwang and Rachel Binx have created a company called Gifpop! that aims to print animated GIFs onto lenticular film.

Lenticular film, which shows pitted, prismatic plastic pictures, used to be popular in childhood stickers and notebooks.

The image in lenticular film appears to move as the viewer moves, with its animation looping through a short number of frames.

The technology dates back to World War II and, like a GIF, has its format constraints.

For instance, a lenticular image can only store about 10 frames, while a GIF has to be small enough to download easily.

This got the designers thinking that the two formats may be able to share common works of art.

Hwang and Binx launched their Kickstarter campaign for Gifpop! with the aim of making this a reality. The project was almost immediately funded.

As well as the custom GIFs, the designers hope to be running off limited batches of works by three GIF artists, including Mr Div, 89-A, and Davidope.

The Atlantic reports that the two designers were inspired to develop the company after seeing Cards Against Humanity, another card-based Kickstarter campaign.

They envision a Cards Against Humanity-style game played with GIF cards.

'One card would say, ‘”My face when I see my ex with her new boyfriend,” and then players would put reaction GIF cards down,’ said Hwang.

Gifpop! still has 25 days of its Kickstarter campaign to go and plans to ship its first custom cards in November.

A pledge of $12 (£7.40) will get one business or postcard size GIF of your choice.

The company also plans to use Instagram and Vine, in addition to GIFs, to create the lenticular cards.
