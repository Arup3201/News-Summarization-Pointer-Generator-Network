Thieves have made an audacious attempt to steal a Banksy artwork valued at £1million by removing the bricks it was painted on from the inside of the building.

The 'Spybooth', which features three 1950s-style spies eavesdropping on a phone-box, appeared on the outer wall of an end-of-terrace house in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, in April.

After several pieces of the wall were recently removed from the building without any sign of forced entry - the current owner of Spybooth, Hekmat Kaveh, is calling the attempted theft an inside job.

Scaffolding has been erected around the Banksy piece in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, while restorative work is done to replace bricks removed by thieves in a failed attempt to steal the artwork 

Several bricks have been removed from inside the terraced house in an audacious attempt to steal the artwork

The local businessman agreed to buy the terraced house from the council for an undisclosed six-figure sum and has been looking to make a profit by selling it for £1 million.

He said: 'It was a real surprise. When we realised the damage had been done we arranged to go in with the owner.

'There was a lot of damage. Brick work has been taken out all over the place. There is nothing wrong with the overall structure though.

'The council are involved to see if a crime has been committed because it's a Grade II listed building.

'I have written to the council for their view and someone from health and safety has also got in. Structurally, they don't see it as a big issue.'

Despite the extensive damage to the inside of the building - there was no sign of forced entry suggesting that whoever did the damage had a key

When the artwork first appeared on the £300,000 terraced house a bidding war ensued - with the council boarding up the wall to prevent vandalism.

After Mr Kaveh agreed on a price for the house, the boarding was taken down so that people could enjoy the art -  but the image was soon vandalised and drilled into.

The new internal damage is somewhat of a mystery though as no-one is currently living in the property.

Mr Kaveh added: 'It's difficult to say how they got in. There was no burglary, let's put it like that. Someone had a key I'm guessing. There was no broken windows or forced entry.

'I think there is something going on in the background but I'm not really sure. There are too many people involved.' 

A protective board was erected in front of the Banksy piece when it was first discovered - the board has since been taken down

Although happy to continue with the deal, he says he will need several assurances from the council and may offer substantially less money if he has to complete restoration work on the inside.

He added: 'Part of my condition was that the council agree a form of protection on it - some form of bullet proof glass to be put up.

'Obviously, the only point is for people to be able to enjoy it.

'I'm really hopeful that we can come up with a glass structure that can protect it. It's about something that looks good and brings tourism to the town.

'There have been a lot of ups and downs but I'm determined to keep at it, as long as it is not permanently damaged - I'm not looking to throw money away.'

The artwork drew lots of attention from local residents when it first appeared on the end of the terraced house

Cheltenham Borough Council has been addressing the situation themselves as the building is listed.

A council spokesperson said: 'Officers from Cheltenham Borough Council's enforcement team entered the property under a warrant of entry recently.

'Mr Wilson, the owner's business partner, was interviewed under caution in relation to a potential criminal offence under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. Evidence is being gathered and investigations continue.'

A spokesperson for Gloucestershire Police said: 'A report of a burglary was received but the investigation has been completed.

'We keep an open mind as to the circumstances of the incident. As regards to any possible damage to a listed building, that is a matter for the council.'
