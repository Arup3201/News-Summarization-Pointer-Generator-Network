MailOnline's Android app has been named one of the best apps of 2014 by Google.

The firm today revealed its top picks for the year, with MailOnline being among just a handful of news apps chosen in the UK.

It is the second year in a row MailOnline has been awarded the accolade.

MailOnline was chosen by Google's editors as one of the best apps of 2014, the second year in a row it has been chosen.

The Award-winning Android app can be downloaded here, and there are also a range of apps for other devices including iOS tablets and phones, as well as Blackberry and Kindle apps here.

Many of the most popular apps from the last 11 months made the list, with  ride-sharing app Uber, the OK Cupid dating app and music recognition app Shazam all named.

Other apps that have shot to popularity include IFTTT, a San Francisco firm which built an app to create 'recipes' that allow users to flash a light in their home when they receive a new email, for example.

Controversial social network Secret also made the list due to its success during the year as an anonymous gossip tool, alongside brain training app Lumosity and selfie editing software Facetune.

Others include Swiftkey, the London-based alternative keyboard for Android which allows users to type by running their finger around the keyboard,and also learns their preferences over time.

A recent report by analystics firm App Annie revealed that app downloads through Google Play exceeded iOS app downloads through Apple's App Store by around 60% in the third quarter of 2014. 

However, the App Store still generated more revenue than Google Play by around the same margin of 60%.
