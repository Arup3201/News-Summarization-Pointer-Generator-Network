Fatal injuries: The official cause of death of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, seen in a 2009 arrest photo, is gunshot wounds and blunt trauma to his head and torso it was revealed on Friday

Boston Marathon bomber suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev died from gunshot wounds and blunt trauma to his head and torso, a funeral home revealed today.

Worcester funeral home owner Peter Stefan who was holding the body of 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev read the details from his death certificate on Friday.

The certificate cites Tsarnaev's 'gunshot wounds of torso and extremities' and lists the time of his death as 1:35 a.m. on April 19, four days after the deadly bombing, Stefan said.

It comes as authorities reportedly found explosive residue in the sink, bath tub and kitchen table in the home Tamerlan shared with his wife Katherine Russell.

The discovery will fuel speculation over how much she knew about the attacks.

Tsarnaev died after a gunfight with authorities who had launched a massive manhunt for him and his brother, ethnic Chechens from Russia who came to the United States about a decade ago.

Police have said he ran out of ammunition before his younger brother dragged his body under a vehicle while fleeing.

Tsarnaev's family on Friday was making arrangements for his funeral as investigators searched the woods near a college attended by 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was captured less than a day after his brother's death.

However they are apprently having trouble finding a place for the body.

'My problem here is trying to find a gravesite. A lot of people don't want to do it. They don't want to be involved with this,' said Stefan, who said dozens of protesters gathered outside his funeral home, upset with his decision to handle the service. 'I keep bringing up the point of Lee Harvey Oswald, Timothy McVeigh or Ted Bundy. Somebody had to do those, too.'

The funeral parlor in Worcester is familiar with Muslim services and said it will handle arrangements for Tamerlan Tsarnaev, whose body was released by the state medical examiner on Thursday night.

The body was taken initially to a North Attleborough funeral home, where it was greeted by about 20 protesters.

On Friday a woman answering a phone at the funeral parlor said it has since been removed and taken elsewhere, the Los Angeles Times reports.

'He was briefly here and he is no 
longer here. That is all the information we can provide,' said the woman
 who only identified herself by her first name of Nina.

Stefan, owner of Graham Putnam and Mahoney Funeral Parlors in 
Worcester, an hour's drive west of Boston, said everybody deserves a 
dignified burial service no matter the circumstances of his or her death
 and he is prepared for protests.

'My problem here is trying to find a gravesite. A lot of 
people don't want to do it. They don't want to be involved with this,' said 
Stefan, who said dozens of protesters gathered outside his funeral home, upset 
with his decision to handle the funeral. 'I keep bringing up the point of Lee 
Harvey Oswald, Timothy McVeigh or Ted Bundy. Somebody had to do those, too.'

Meanwhile, two U.S. officials said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told interrogators that he and his brother initially considered setting off their bombs on July Fourth.

Boston police said they planned to review security procedures for the Independence Day Boston Pops concert and fireworks display, which draws a crowd of more than 500,000 annually and is broadcast to a national TV audience.

Authorities plan to look at security 
procedures for large events held in other cities, notably the massive 
New Year's Eve celebration held each year in New York City's Times 
Square, Massachusetts state police spokesman David Procopio said.

Gov. Deval Patrick said everything possible will be done to assure a safe event.

'I think the most important thing is that we got them, and there's investigation continuing about where the other leads may lead,' he said. 'I can tell you, having been thoroughly briefed, that the law enforcement at every level is pursuing everything.'

As part of the bombing investigation, federal, state and local authorities were searching the woods near the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth campus, where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was a student.

Christina DiIorio-Sterling, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, could not say what investigators were looking for but said residents should know there is no threat to public safety.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was found hiding in a tarp-covered boat in a suburban Boston backyard, faces a charge of using a weapon of mass destruction to kill. Three of his college classmates were arrested Wednesday and accused of helping after the bombing to remove a laptop and backpack from his dormitory room before the FBI searched it.

The April 15 bombing, using pressure 
cookers packed with explosives, nails, ball bearings and metal shards, 
killed three people and injured more than 260 others near the marathon's
 finish line.

The brothers considered setting off their bombs on July Fourth but decided to carry out the attack sooner when they finished assembling the bombs, the surviving suspect told interrogators after he was arrested, according to two U.S. officials briefed on the investigation. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation.

Investigators believe some of the explosives used in the attack were assembled in Tamerlan Tsarnaev's home, though there may have been some assembly elsewhere, one of the officials said. It does not appear that the brothers ever had big, definitive plans, the official said.

The brothers' mother insists the allegations against them are lies.

Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security ordered border agents to immediately begin verifying that every international student who arrives in the U.S. has a valid student visa, according to an internal memorandum obtained Friday by The Associated Press. The new procedure is the government's first security change directly related to the Boston bombings.

The order from a senior official at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, David J. Murphy, was circulated Thursday and came one day after President Barack Obama's administration acknowledged that one of the students accused of hiding evidence, Azamat Tazhayakov, of Kazakhstan, was allowed to return to the U.S. in January without a valid student visa.

Tazhayakov's lawyer has said he had nothing to do with the bombing and was shocked by it.

A benefit concert featuring Aerosmith, James Taylor and Jimmy Buffett is scheduled for May 30 at the TD Garden in Boston. The proceeds will go to The One Fund, which has taken in more than $28 million for those injured and the families of those who were killed.

The fund's administrator, Kenneth Feinberg, said Friday he plans to hold meetings with victims next week and begin cutting checks by the end of June.
