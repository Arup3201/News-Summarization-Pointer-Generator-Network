Paul Crowther, 53, was jailed alongside his neighbours Jamie Hooper and Sarah Ellis for the attack on Claus Reinauer's flat in January

A gang who broke into a German nurse's flat, trashed it and scrawled Nazi slurs on the walls has been jailed.

Claus Reinauer returned from an aid mission to find his bedding covered in faeces and urine, his clothes cut up and covered in bleach, broken furniture, food thrown around, the heating left on, and important documents destroyed.

The words: 'Nazi c***, f*** off back to Germany' and 'Kraut Nazi b******' had been daubed on the walls in pencil.

An 'irreplaceable' penknife that was his only memento of his grandfather was stolen and all of his electrical appliances were left on, using up the remaining money on Mr Reinauer's meter.

Paul Crowther, a neighbour with a longstanding grudge against the nurse, broke in to the flat in January with Jamie Hooper and Sarah Ellis, a couple who lived in the same block in Exeter, Devon.

The trio went 'berserk', Exeter Crown Court heard.

Other neighbours called police and Mr Reinauer was summoned home, arriving at 5am to find his home trashed and without power. The full extent of the damage only became known once it was light.

Mr David Bowen, prosecuting, said: 'Mr
Reinauer is a German national. He left his home in good order. While he
was away these three broke in and ransacked the flat.

'They broke furniture, threw food 
around the flat and bleach over his clothes, cut up some clothing and 
cut the buttons off shirts and cut up documents including his birth 
certificate, exam certificates and a nursing certificate.

'They also took an irreplaceable 
penknife which had great sentimental value because it was his only 
memento of his grandfather and cut up an English Language certificate 
which cost Â£100 to replace.

'We say this was deliberate targeting based on hostility to the victim's race.'

Mr Reinauer suspected the attack had been carried out by his neighbours and officers found finger and shoe prints linking the defendants to the scene.

Crowther, 53, Hooper, 23, and Ellis, 24, all of Exeter, admitted burglary with intent to commit criminal damage.

Judge John Neligan ruled that the offence was racially aggravated and the trio cried as they were jailed for a year.

Jamie Hooper, left, and Sarah Ellis lived in the same block as Mr Reinauer and Crowther. They joined their neighbour Paul Crowther in what a judge called a racially aggravated attack on Mr Reinauer's home

Judge Neligan said: 'They knew he was away
and they went berserk and scrawled hate graffiti on the wall. It is a 
very serious offence. All three effectively trashed the flat.

'An aggravating feature was what they 
wrote on the wall.

'There was damage to his personal and sentimental property and he 
suffered financial loss.

'There was vandalism and soiling of 
his home, which should be a place of safety and peace.'

Lawyers for all three defendants said their clients were not racist.

Kelly Scrivener, defending Crowther, said he was on bad terms with his neighbour and they had previously exchanged insults.

She told the court that Crowther had tried to apologise but Mr Reinauer had slapped him.

Miss Scrivener said: 'There had been disagreements and they called each other names. This was the wrong type of name calling but not racism at all.'

Rupert Taylor, for the defence, said Ellis had a difficult life and got involved in the burglary after all three had been drinking.

He said: 'She does not harbour any racist tendencies. That is not what this case is about.'

Hooper's representative Jeremy Harris said: 'He never had any hostility to Mr Reinauer. He has no racist feelings and is deeply ashamed of what he did.'
