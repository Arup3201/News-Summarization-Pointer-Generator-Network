The mother of a teen snatched from her Georgia home Tuesday was once arrested on charges she was helping a man pegged to her daughter's abduction to traffic in 500 pounds of marijuana.

Police first believed that Ayvani Perez, 14, was snatched in a random home invasion, but new revelations about her mother Maria Magdalena Corral’s 2012 arrest on charges of trafficking $300,000 worth of pot cast serious doubt on the theory.

Locked up with Corral on the massive drug charge was Juan Alberto Contreras-Ramirez, 40, who was arrested Wednesday in connection to Perez’s harrowing abduction that came to a merciful end Wednesday when Perez was returned to her family.

Connected: Abducted teen Ayvani Hope Perez's mother Maria Corral was once arrested on drug trafficking charges along with Juan Alberto Contreras-Ramirez, 40, one of the men arrested Wednesday in connection to Perez's kidnapping

Along with 29-year-old Wildrego 
Jackson, Contreras-Ramirez was nabbed during a massive manhunt that 
began in the early morning hours Tuesday after two men broke into 
Corral’s Ellenwood, Georgia home and took the teen girl when they left.

The
Georgia Bureau of Investigation released sketches of the two African 
American men and an alert was raised asking people to keep an out for 
them and the grey sedan in which they drove away after shooting the 
family dog and taking the girl hostage.

At
the time, police believed the crime was random. They had only lived in 
the house for a month, Corral said. And even after Wednesday’s arrest, 
the two kidnappers remained suspects in the crime and at large.

Snatched: Armed invaders stole Ayvani Hope Perez, 14, away from her family Tuesday and shot her dog. She was safely returned Wednesday

Busted: Wildrego Jackson (in mugshots from 2011, left,  and 2013, right) has a long criminal history that includes cruelty to children and has added a conspiracy to kidnap charge to the list after Wednesday's arrest in connection with Ayvani Perez's abduction

The terrifying incident, which saw the
shooting of the innocent family dog, seemed like a quintessential 
shattering of suburban tranquillity.

But
a new twist came Thursday when WSB-TV learned that the kidnapped girl’s
mother was arrested in February 2012 with Contreras-Ramirez and three 
other men.

The group was 
found in Stockbridge, Georgia home where 500 pounds of marijuana and 
$3,000 cash were uncovered during a drug raid, according to the Henry Daily Herald.

Terrified: The 4-foot-9, teen was wrenched from her mother around 2am Tuesday while she was still wearing her Star Wars pajamas

Corral is not believed to have been living in the home.

Contreras-Ramirez
and Corral were later released when the charges were dropped, but the 
new information makes the kidnapping that had a nation fearing the worst
for nearly 36 hours appear far from random.

Contreras-Ramirez, a Mexican national, remained behind bars Thursday, though only on immigration-related charges.

Along
with him was Wildrego Jackson, a man with an extensive criminal history
that includes child cruelty as well as various drug and assault 
charges. Jackson, whose upwards of 14 aliases have included Wildrego 
Johnson and Travis Gray, was held on a conspiracy to kidnap charge.

Now Perez is home with her family and two men are locked up in connection to her abduction, but the saga is far from over.

‘We believe those two suspects in the drawings are still at large,’ said FBI Special Agent Rick Maxwell.

Clayton County Police Chief Greg Porter also remained confident that an arrest would be made soon.

‘We have more than 100 officers involved,’ he said Wednesday.

In the hours following the kidnapping, friends, family, and even concerned strangers quickly posted Amber Alerts and other announcements on social media.

We got her: Clayton County Police Chief Gregory Porter made the announcement at a press event Wednesday afternoon but remained tight-lipped about how Perez was recovered

Pictured: Police sketches show the two African American men who authorities say took Ayvani after their demands for money and jewelry went unmet. Even after two men were apprehended Wednesday in connection to the crime, authorities said these men remained on the loose

Ongoing: FBI assistant apecial agent Ricky Maxwell announced that two men were in custody but that the men in the police sketches remained at large. He declined to give further details due to the 'ongoing' case

Suspicious: Ayvani was reunited with her family Wednesday, but speculation has now arisen over her mother's connection to men pinned to the kidnapping

A prayer vigil was also held at a local high school and 150 people attended.

‘She's so nice,’ one attendee told 11alive.com. ‘I don't know why people would do this to her. I'm praying just to get her home safely.’

Another classmate was struggling to come to grips with the situation.

‘I don't get it,’ said Sydney Chaquir. ‘It's not clicking in my mind why somebody would do this to her. It's like a dream.’

Clayton County Georgia police spokesman Phong Nguyen said Tuesday the invasion appears to be completely random.

‘It didn’t appear that they knew each other,’ he said. ‘They just moved in about a month ago.’

Nguyen said the two African American males smashed through a back door of the home and Maria Perez quickly tried to hide her children, but the men found Ayvani.

The men wanted money and jewelry, but Maria had none to give, so they took the girl instead.

The abductors escaped with Perez in a grey Dodge or Chevrolet sedan and were described as wearing dark clothing.

Perez was believed to be in extreme danger and a Levi's Call—Georgia's version of the Amber alert—was activated.

Senseless: Two black males in dark clothing broke into Perez's Ellenwood, Georgia home at 2am Tuesday. When her mother had no valuables, they shot the dog and took Ayvani

Spreading the word: Many friends and even concerned strangers quickly took to social media to spread word of Ayvani's kidnapping and to gather information

Authorities said Wednesday that Perez was healthy at the time of her reunion with her family.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation released sketches of the two men who kidnapped Perez from the 3800 block of Brookgate Drive.

Those men are still on the loose and Clayton County police urge anyone who may have information to call (678) 610-4781 immediately.

Relief: Around 150 of Ayvani's classmates and former classmates gathered at a Hampton, Georgia high school for a Tuesday night prayer vigil. Their prayers were answered Wednesday

Alert: Clayton County police monitor Brookgate Drive, a suburban street full of families where Ayvani had lived for just one month before she was snatched

Man hunt: A Clayton County Police officer questions a driver in the Brookgate subdivision. State, federal, and local officials have all joined the frantic search for Ayvani, which ended Wednesday with her joyous reunion with family

Worries: Toni Hill walks her granddaughter home from the bus stop Tuesday afternoon. Ayvani's unthinkable kidnapping now has nearby residents in Ellenwood, Georgia wondering if the once quiet area is still safe

Freightening: Kybria Jackson, 13, and Mykevius Hodges, 12, talk while Clayton County police officer, T. Lucas, right, checks outgoing and incoming traffic in the Brookgate subdivision

Vigilant: Clayton County police Sergeant K.T. Hughes, officer P. Nguyen and officer T. Lucas converse as night fell over Brookgate subdivision Tuesday

The search: Investigators quickly fanned out across Georgia with police checkpoints and helicopters searching for Ayvani on Tuesday
