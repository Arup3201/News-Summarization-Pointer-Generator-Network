Andrew Flintoff is preparing to be granted a licence to fight by boxing authorities as he reinvents himself as a professional heavyweight boxer.

The former English cricket captain showed off a new muscly physique with his transformation almost complete as the British Boxing Board of Control considered Flintoff's case after a rigorous testing process.

The 34-year-old,  who had not fought at 
any level before an impromptu sparring session with Barry McGuigan last 
year, has given up alcohol and lost more than 
two stone in weight after 10 weeks of full-time training under boxing 
legend McGuigan and his son Shane.

The Board are just waiting on elements of the medical before they sanction his professional debut.

A November 30 date at Manchester Arena has been mooted, although an opponent has not yet been decided.

Once one of English cricket's most 
popular and charismatic characters, it was Flintoff's various brushes 
with the sport's authorities and a raffish persona that always endeared 
him to the England fans.

Training: Flintoff has given up drinking and has shed more than two stone

Retiring: Plagued by injury, when Flintoff quit cricket he said: 'I love playing Test cricket, but the decision has been made for me - I don't think I've been left with any other choices'

He famously lost the England vice-captaincy after getting into difficulties in a pedalo after heavy drinking - instantly immortalised in the tabloids as 'Fredalo' -  following a defeat to New Zealand in the Caribbean in 2007.

He was also forced to apologise to team-mates after missing part of a squad-bonding trip to Flanders.

Training: Flintoff has given up drinking

He failed to board the bus taking captain Andrew Strauss and the other players on a tour of First World War trenches - sparking speculation he had drunk too much at the previous evening's private dinner.

When he retired from cricket, he said: 'I love playing Test cricket, but the decision has been made for me - I don't think I've been left with any other choices.

'I've not been playing Test cricket very often over the last few years so it's bitterly disappointing but it's something I've not been doing very often anyway.

'It's also important for the team that I make this announcement because they need to move on.'

Flintoff
has stayed active since quitting cricket in 2010 because of injury, 
mainly to an ankle and both shoulders. He has cycled from Athens to 
London and rowed the channel among a host of 
charity challenges

His current weight is understood to be
under 16 stone, with a desired fighting weight in the region of 
15-and-a-half stone, which would leave him on the lean side for a 6ft 
4in heavyweight.

His 
decision to enter the ring has drawn a mixed response in the boxing 
community, with promoter Frank Warren suggesting Flintoff is too old to 
start life as a pro fighter.

David Price, the British and Commonwealth heavyweight champion, insists Flintoff is only justified in fighting if his motives are genuine.

He said in September: 'Freddie’s as entitled as anyone to try it out and some people come to professional boxing later in life but if it’s just some type of PR stunt then it’s disrespectful to boxing.

'The reality is he could get hurt if there’s someone in front of him who’ll stand up and throw punches back.

'It’s car crash TV but will probably get people watching.'

Flintoff said: ‘It’s an opportunity I couldn’t pass up.

'I played my last game of cricket at the age of 31 and I’m only 34 now.

'I’ve always loved boxing and I’m going to have a go at it and see where it takes us.

'When you put yourself out there you put yourself up for a bit of criticism, but I’m not bothered.

'The people who criticise, what are they are doing? Criticising is easy to do.’

Flintoff retired from Test cricket in July 2009 following an 11-year England career.
