Rebecca Jones, 30, was arrested over the falsification of medical records at Labour-run healthcare trust

A nurse yesterday admitted neglecting nine vulnerable patients in a scandal-hit Labour-run healthcare trust.

Rebecca Jones, 30, was arrested over the falsification of medical records as part of what is thought to be the biggest criminal investigation into alleged harm and neglect of patients at an NHS hospital.

Fourteen staff have been suspended from the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, South Wales as part of the ongoing probe into neglect.

Families of patients have alleged that failings are even worse than the Mid Staffordshire Hospital Trust scandal because of the attempts to ‘supress’ wrongdoing.

Jones admitted wilfully neglecting nine patients ‘lacking capacity’ between February 2012 and February 2013.

One of the mistreated patients was mother-of-five Lilian Williams, 82, who died in 2012 after a string of failings.

An inquiry found she was denied life-saving medication, allowed to starve for days and left in agony because her prosthetic leg was not taken off at night.

Under devolution, the NHS in Wales is controlled by Labour rather than the Coalition based in Westminster, and at the time of the failings, the trust’s board was chaired by a former Labour MP, Win Griffiths.

When Labour’s first minister in Wales, Carwyn Jones, was alerted to the scandal of poor nursing standards at the trust, his government waited over a year to order an investigation.

Jones sat in the dock at Cardiff Crown Court alongside fellow nurses Lauro Bertulano, 45, and Clare Cahill, 41, who are also charged with wilfully neglecting patients but have yet to enter pleas.

Prosecutor Catherine Richards told the court: ‘The allegations against nurse Bertulano relate to some of the same patients as Jones.

‘It is an unusual case but we are not alleging any joint enterprise or collusion.’

All three nurses allegedly failed to check patient’s blood glucose levels and then falsified official hospital notes to cover up the mistake.

The nurses, who were working on a specialist ward that dealt mostly with stroke patients, are currently suspended from their jobs.

The three, from Bridgend, South Wales, worked at the 548-bed Princess of Wales Hospital which has also been heavily criticised over patient waiting times and quality of care.

An independent report found a ‘lack of suitably qualified, educated and motivated staff.’

Peter Walsh, chief executive of the charity Action Against Medical Accidents, said: ‘We have heard from a number of people with serious concerns about care at the hospital.’

All three nurse were released on bail on the condition they do not contact any nursing staff or visiting the hospital unless for specific medical treatment.

Judge Eleri Rees said she would sentence Jones at a later date depending on whether other nurses plead guilty or are charged with similar offences coming from the police investigation.

Judge Rees said: ‘At least one defendant has faced up to their responsibility to the matters and I make no comment about any of the others.’

Earlier this year it emerged that Welsh cancer patients are flooding into English hospitals for treatment they are being denied at home.

The number crossing the border has quadrupled from just 3,471 a decade ago to 15,450 last year, fuelled by a lack of access to the National Cancer Drugs Fund and longer waits for vital scans.
