A grieving mother yesterday condemned Nick Clegg for opposing tough new measures to tackle knife crime.

Caroline Shearer said the Liberal Democrats appeared to have no understanding of the dangers posed to young people by knives as the furious public backlash against their opposition to mandatory jail terms grew.

And she questioned whether Mr Clegg would take the same view if his own children were threatened.

Miss Shearer, whose son Jay Whiston was stabbed to death aged 17 at a house party in Essex in 2012, said people want ‘protection, not politics’.

Referring to Tory plans to introduce automatic six-month jail sentences for anyone caught with a knife a second time, she said: ‘My son drowned in his own blood – in his lungs – and they want to give these people a second chance?

‘Once is enough to kill, you do not need to give them a second chance.

‘Everybody out there has children, grandchildren, nephews, nieces – it’s about protecting them. If someone went up to Nick Clegg’s child and waved a knife at them would Nick Clegg really be happy?’

Miss Shearer, who has set up a group to campaign against knife crime, said MPs were too cocooned from reality by their security to understand the real damage caused by the weapons.

The Deputy Prime Minister has confirmed that he would veto the introduction of what he called ‘headline-grabbing solutions’ in the wake of the murder of Leeds teacher Ann Maguire last week.

He claimed he was ‘not soft on knife crime at all’ but said he would block mandatory jail terms for repeat offenders. Mr Clegg’s comments prompted a furious backlash.

One caller to his regular phone-in show on LBC Radio demanded to know how many times people needed to be caught carrying a blade before they were punished.

Referring to the Lib Dem leader, he added: ‘How are elderly people meant to sleep in their beds when you’ve got lunatics in suits like him who are looking after this country?’

The Coalition row erupted last week after the Mail revealed that Mr Clegg was blocking plans to crack down on knife crime.

He confirmed yesterday that he would not allow the plans to go ahead, claiming the measure could ‘turn the young offenders of today into the hardened criminals of tomorrow’.

But he was facing the prospect of a humiliating  Commons defeat over the issue after Ed Miliband said he would side with the Conservatives if they brought forward the proposals.

‘I don’t agree with Nick Clegg,’ said the Labour leader. ‘I think we do need tougher penalties for knife crime. We are definitely sympathetic to the issue of mandatory sentences after conviction for a second offence.

London Mayor Boris Johnson has said measures to tackle knife crime need 'unequivocal' party support

'The public want to know that we are going to send a strong message to people who carry knives repeatedly that it is not acceptable.’

Mr Clegg has dismissed police concerns over the issue but Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said mandatory jail sentences would have a clear deterrent effect.

‘There are too many people carrying knives so I support the idea of a minimum sentence,’ he said.

‘It sends a very clear message to people who carry knives. It’s the casual carrying of knives that eventually may lead to a murder.’

Tory MP Nick de Bois, who tabled the amendment that would introduce the necessary legislation, said Mr Clegg had ‘misjudged the public mood on this issue’.

Mayor of London Boris Johnson echoed those comments, saying the measure needed ‘unequivocal’ cross-party support.

‘This amendment is a clear signal to those who act with such impunity that carrying a knife will not be tolerated,’ he said.

Tory sources said Mr Cameron was sympathetic to the amendment, which has been signed by 40 Tory backbenchers.

The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘How we do more in this area around knife crime and how we make our streets safer is something he is giving very active consideration to.’

Earlier this week Britain’s top judge also backed heavier  sentences for knife criminals, saying they would act as a deterrent.

Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas called for an urgent review of  sentencing for youths carrying knives, saying it was a ‘major problem’ among 12 to 14-year-olds.

Nick Clegg will lose the next election if he acts as a ‘destructive brake’ on the Coalition, a senior Liberal Democrat warned yesterday.

Jeremy Browne, who served as a Foreign Office and Home Office Minister, said the Lib Dems would pay a high electoral price if they continued to ‘adopt the mindset of an opposition party in government’.
