Student nurse Barbara Allatt was kicked off her university course when she highlighted problems in hospitals

A student nurse who blew the whistle on the appalling care of  elderly patients at Stafford Hospital was disciplined and is still blocked from completing her course – while staff she complained about continue to work in the NHS.

Barbara Allatt, 43, reported her concerns over poor care and patient neglect to her university tutors, hospital mentors and senior nurses.

But she found herself facing a fitness-to-practise panel at the University of Stafford’s school of nursing, which threw her off her course.

She has since lost two appeals against the decision and, three years later, her place remains permanently withdrawn.

Despite her role in raising concerns, she remains the only health professional to be disciplined at Mid Staffs NHS Trust, where there were between 400 and 1,200 unnecessary deaths from 2005 to 2008.

Ms Allatt, from Cannock, Staffordshire, now plans to take her case to the European Court of Human Rights in an attempt to change whistleblowing legislation to ensure student nurses are also protected. She is being supported by the Royal College of Nursing.

Her case comes amid the growing furore over the silencing of NHS whistleblowers that has broken out  in response to the Mid Staffordshire scandal.

Gary Walker, who was sacked as chief executive of United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust, claimed this month he was handed a £500,000 pay-off but was prevented from airing his concerns about patient safety.

Nearly 600 more doctors, nurses and managers have been paid a total of £15 million in ‘special severance payments’ during the past three years, the latest figures reveal.

Mother-of-one Ms Allatt said: ‘Because I wasn’t employed by the NHS and was still a student, I have no right of appeal within the Health Service and I can’t go to an industrial tribunal.

‘If they want to keep me out of the job I love, it seems there is nothing I can do about it.

‘What sickens me is that the nurses who neglected and abused patients appear to have got away with what they did. There doesn’t seem to be any justice in a situation where I did the right thing and have been punished all these years.’

Ms Allatt was working as an occupational therapy technician when she began her nursing diploma at the  University of Stafford in 2009. The course included placements on the wards at Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust, which includes Cannock Chase and Stafford Hospitals. 

The scandal over poor care at Stafford had already emerged but what Ms Allatt experienced on the wards suggested it was still going on.

While at Cannock Hospital she reported seeing a nurse putting tablets in a patient’s tea and patient hygiene being neglected. During a placement at Stafford Hospital she reported patients left in soiled sheets and nurses mocking patients.

Julie Bailey, of Cure the NHS, which campaigns for better NHS care, said: ‘We desperately need people like her in the NHS. Somebody should be doing something to make sure she can resume her training.’

A spokesman for Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘An investigation was carried out into Ms Allatt’s complaints and came to a natural conclusion that there was no case to answer.’

A Staffordshire University spokesman said: ‘We remain committed to whistle-blowing and to supporting our students through the process.’
