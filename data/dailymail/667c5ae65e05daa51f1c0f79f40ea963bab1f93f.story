Police say Australian bikie gangs are expanding into South East Asia to bolster their underworld operations.

The gangs are establishing in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Cambodia, where local chapters of the clubs are recruiting new members and working with their Australian counterparts.

The overseas expansion of local gangs is one of the key factors addressed by the National Anti-Gang Squad, based on the Gold Coast.

The group leads investigations into the activities of Australian-based gangs overseas and their links to crime in Australia.

In June, the Gang Squad hosted a South East Asia conference in Bangkok to tackle the mounting threat of outlaw motorcycle gangs.

It was attended by 75 State and territory police officers from Australia, as well as officers from Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia Vietnam Singapore and America.

The Commander of the Gangs Squad in NSW Detective Superintendant Deb Wallace told Daily Mail: 'We keep a very close eye on outlaw motorcycle gangs and, in recent years, have observed a number of gang members moving overseas.'

'In particular, the Rebels have made a concerted effort to expand their international footprint', he said. 

'The rationale behind this expansion is driven largely by organised crime objectives. Chapters have been established to tap into underworld business opportunities in overseas markets, particularly in locations where law enforcement agencies don't have the same level of anti-gang resources or expertise as we do here in NSW.'  

The Rebels MC have made the largest expansion into south-east Asia. They club has 2000 members in Australia alone, making them the largest motorcycle club in the country

The Minister for Justice Michael Keenan said the National Anti Gang Squad Australia is 'leading the fight against Outlaw Motorcycle Gang criminal highways through South East Asia.'

'The activities of organised crime groups and outlaw motorcycle gangs are an ongoing threat to Australia.

'They are violent predators who profit from the misery of drug trafficking, drug manufacturing, extortion, prostitution and firearms trafficking.'

The Rebels MC have 2000 members in Australia alone, making them the largest motorcycle club in the country.

The Rebels, who were founded in Brisbane in the late 1960's, have successfully expanded into Malta and New Zealand.

They have now established chapters in Thailand, Indonesia Malaysia and Cambodia.

In July, the head of the rebels Alex Vella had his Visa cancelled while on holiday in his home country of Malta, where he has since been stranded.

The news of overseas expansion comes amid harsh national crackdowns on the clubs, particularly in Queensland, where the Campbell Newman Government introduced the Vicious Lawless Association Disestablishment Act  to combat the gangs in 2013.
