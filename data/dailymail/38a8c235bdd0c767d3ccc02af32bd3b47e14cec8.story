Funnyman Adam Sandler has certainly got reason to be laughing all the way to the bank.

The 48-year-old, who commands north of $15million per film, has topped a list of Hollywood’s most overpaid stars.

Following a string of box-office flops, Forbes says the actor provides the least value for his huge fees.

Film flop: Adam Sandler has topped a list of Hollywood’s most overpaid stars

The magazine looked at his last three movies up until June 1 2014 and compared what he was paid against what the movies made to provide a 'return on investment number'.

Animated and limited release films and cameo roles were not included in the calculations.

Although Sandler's latest film Grown Ups 2 was a hit, pulling in $246 million at the box office, it didn't go far enough to make up for his previous flops, Jack and Jill and That's My Boy.

Overall the star’s last three films cost an estimated $229million to make, including his salary costs, but brought in just over $149million.

In contrast, the world’s highest-grossing film over the past year has been Transformers: Age of Extinction Paramount Pictures, which cost $210 million to make and made more than a billion at the box office. 

It starred Mark Wahlberg and Stanley Tucci. 

The magazine said Sandler had the lowest return on investment of any actor analyzed.

Here is the list of the most overpaid actors in Hollywood according to Forbes magazine and the returns they make on every $1 paid.

For every $1 he was paid, it was estimated he returned
an average of $3.20 in 2014. 

It is the second year Sandler has snagged the dubious honor.

Johnny Depp, the star of the hugely successful Pirates of the
Caribbean films, came in second on Forbes' list, returning an average of $4.10
for each dollar paid.

This was put down to recent misses like The Lone
Ranger and Dark Shadows.

Comedian Ben Stiller, whose film Night at the Museum:
Secrets of the Tomb opened in U.S. theaters earlier this month,
was number three with a $4.80 return.

This was due to the 2011 action-comedy Tower Heist and 2012 sci-fi comedy The
Watch, under-performing at the box office.

Green Lantern star Ryan Reynolds, whose action comedy
film R.I.P.D. was one of the biggest misses of 2013, was
fourth with $4.90 for each dollar paid, followed by dual Oscar
winner Tom Hanks, who pulled in a $5.20 return, rounding out the
top five.

'Cloud Atlas was a very expensive flop and Hanks played
six different roles in the movie,' according to Forbes.

Will Ferrell, Channing Tatum, Denzel Washington, Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck were others pulled out on their earnings.
