The life sentence handed down to the schoolboy who murdered a teacher was today condemned as too harsh by youth justice campaigners.

William Cornick, 16, will serve at least 20 years for killing Ann Maguire, 61, who was stabbed seven times from behind as she taught a Spanish class at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds in April.

Mr Justice Coulson warned Cornick, who was 15 at the time, that he might never be released from prison - and her widower, Don, described the killing as a ‘monumental act of cowardice and evil’.

Too harsh: Penelope Gibbs (left), the chairman of the Standing Committee for Youth Justice umbrella group of charities and campaign groups, said the sentence given to murderer William Cornick (right) was too long

But former magistrate Penelope Gibbs, the chairman of  the Standing Committee for Youth Justice (SCYJ) umbrella group of charities and campaign groups, said the sentence was too long.

She told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: ‘We are out of line with the whole of western Europe.

‘There are no other countries within Western Europe which give children - and this boy is seen as a child under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and is in the youth justice system - who would give children a life sentence.’

Her comments were criticised as ‘stupid’ on Twitter today. Mrs Gibbs accepted that the sentence had to serve as a punishment, but said there was ‘no evidence’ for the 20-year minimum tariff.

‘Punishment is also incredibly important, particularly for the victims and families, but the fact is, how many years do we need for punishment? We have given him a sentence which is more than his own lifetime,’ she said.

‘He was 15 when he did this crime and we would say that you don't need that long to punish.

‘What is crucial is that when he is released he is assessed as no longer being of danger to himself and others and thus we would all be safer. 

'But there is no evidence that that takes 20 years and we've looked and we think that this is the longest sentence given to a child in at least 10 years.

‘I'm not going to tell you exactly what the right sentence would have been, but 20 years and a life sentence is too long.’

She continued: ‘There are very good prisons, there is a prison called Grendon [in Buckinghamshire] which is a therapeutic community, and prisoners go there for a few years and it has great results.

‘The question is - safer society, yes; punishment, yes - but does it need to be more than his lifetime?’

Rose Dixon, chief executive of Birmingham-based charity Support After Murder and Manslaughter, said that members of her organisation would ‘not be impressed' with Mrs Gibbs's comments.

She told MailOnline: ‘People need to be aware that for many families the trauma of being bereaved in this horrific and traumatic way will never leave them and their lives can never be the same again.

‘With specialist support they can rebuild a life - but not the life they had before the brutal killing of their loved one.

‘Every birthday, anniversary and Christmas for the rest of their lives their loved one will be missed and the pain goes on for many, many years.

‘According to reports I believe this young man has said he “couldn't give a s***” about the impact on her family. Please will organisations or people who want to comment on cases like this think of the bereaved family involved.’

Mrs Dixon added that if and when Cornick is released, he will probably have to be given a new identity - something which currently costs ‘in the region of £250,000 per person’.

And Adam Pemberton, assistant chief executive of the charity Victim Support said: ‘Sentencing is a matter for the court judge who has heard all the facts of the case, and is carried out in accordance with Sentencing Council guidelines.

‘We believe it is essential when passing sentence that judges and magistrates also consider the impact on the victim or the victim’s family, not just the nature of the offence.

‘Victims, the bereaved and the public need to understand the reasons why a particular sentence has been handed down, and therefore good communication is key.

‘To maintain public confidence in the criminal justice system it is vital that offenders are appropriately punished, that serious and violent crimes are dealt with robustly and that offenders are properly rehabilitated so they don’t go on to commit more crime.’ 

Stephen Pollard, editor of the Jewish Chronicle, said on Twitter: 'Someone bleating on BBC Radio 4 Today that Ann Maguire's killer 20 year “minimum” sentence too long. How about having someone say it's too short?'

Author Wilhemina Bothwell added: 'Who was that woman making stupid, stupid comments about 20-year sentence being too long for school room killer? Tell her about psychopaths.'

And company director Russell Turner said: 'I'm sure she would be saying the sentence was too long if it was her mother that had been murdered.'

But University of Southampton academic Mark Telford told Mrs Gibbs on Twitter: 'Good to hear you make those important points about capacity for change on BBC Radio 4 Today this morning.'

Oxford-educated Mrs Gibbs, 50, who lives in a £1.7million four-bedroom semi-detached house in Kentish Town, north-west London, has been working in prison and justice reform since 2007.

Prior to her work for the likes of the Prison Reform Trust, SCYJ and another charity called Transform Justice, Mrs Gibbs, who is married to David, 51, was an account manager for a marketing firm and a radio producer.

Part of Cornick's rehabilitation could see him return to a classroom during his sentence.

Brian Hamilton, chair of the Manchester College: University and College Union prison branch, said Cornick could be taught in a class of around eight people with a focus on basic literacy and numeracy skills and vocational training to ensure prisoners are employable on their release.

Cornick, who took and passed five GCSEs a year early, would be unlikely to be able to study for higher level qualifications.

Mr Hamilton, who teaches in prisons, said: ‘I believe this young man is quite intelligent. He would probably be above the level they are trying to take them to in that establishment.’

He added: ‘It used to be that there was funding for them to do higher level courses but because of the cuts it's more difficult for people of a higher ability to continue their education.’

Mr Hamilton said Cornick would be treated the same as any other offender.

He said: ‘They will do a risk assessment on anybody but, unless they're an immediate risk and deemed too dangerous to be in the class, he would be treated in exactly the same way as everybody else.’

Cornick attacked Mrs Maguire after boasting to friends that he was going to kill her. He also said he was going to murder other teachers, including a pregnant woman ‘so as to kill her unborn child’.

The court heard that he later told doctors: ‘I said I was going to do other stuff but I never got the chance, other murders. It was a triple homicide.’

After the murder the teenager told psychiatrists that he ‘couldn't give a s***’ and added: ‘Everything I've done is fine and dandy.’
