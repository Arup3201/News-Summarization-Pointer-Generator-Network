Manchester City threw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 away to CSKA Moscow in their Champions League Group E match on Tuesday. 

Sergio Aguero and James Milner gave the Premier League champions a commanding first half start before Seydou Doumbia and a Bebras Natcho penalty completed CSKA's comeback late on.

Here, Sportsmail's Dan Ripley gives you his verdict on how the players performed.

MANCHESTER CITY (4-4-2)

Joe Hart - 6

A pedestrian throughout the match who had little to do. Couldn't get near either goal scored past him.

Pablo Zabaleta - 6

Combined well with James Milner in the first half but faded after the interval.

Vincent Kompany - 6.5

Caught napping for the first goal but was otherwise City's best defender.

Eliaquim Mangala - 6

Made some crucial interceptions but still hasn't reached the level to justify his £32million price tag.

Aleksandar Kolorov - 6.5

Lively first half in attack as the Serbian whipped in numerous good crosses. Similar to Zabaleta though in that he faded in the first half. Gave away the soft penalty for CSKA's equaliser - but it shouldn't have been awarded in truth.  

James Milner - 7

Reacted superbly to score City's second goal and looked dangerous in attack.

Fernando - 6.5

Booked for reckless tackle in the second half which left City exposed as the hosts chased the game. Rash challenge left him treading on egg shells as City failed to see the game out.

Yaya Toure - 7 - Star man

Controlled the first half from midfield but never reached the same standards after the break.

David Silva - 6.5 

Beautiful chipped through-ball helped create the first goal but sacrificed as City tried to hold on in the latter stages of the match.

Edin Dzeko - 7

Unselfishly squared to Sergio Aguero for City's opener and was unlucky not win a first half penalty.

Sergio Aguero - 7

Continues to score for fun but not even he could get City ticking after half-time.

Substitutes

Jesus Navas - 6

Brought on when City tried to contain CSKA, and hit them on the counter-attack, but failed to influence the game with his pace.

Fernandino and Stevan Jovetic - N/A

Both had little time to make an impact in the game.
