Russian police are investigating whether a video posted on YouTube shows a genuine kidnapping or a hoax.

The video was taken on May 18 and purports to show a young man crossing a street in Moscow and narrowly miss being hit by a car.

In a fury, he throws a drink at the vehicle and swears at its driver.

Scroll down for video.

The young man on the zebra crossing remonstrates as the car is obviously not going to stop

And indeed it illegally runs the zebra crossing. The unamused young man throws his drink at the vehicle, which stops abruptly

The occupants of the car get out and the young man makes his point rather than running away

The car screeches to a halt before three men get out, rush up to the pedestrian, grab him and hurl him into the boot and drive off.

The whole scene was captured on video by the dashboard camera of Artem Mailov, 22.

He said: ‘The police have quizzed me time and time again about this, asking whether I thought it was genuine or a stunt. They asked why I uploaded it to the internet.

‘All I can say is that it looked like it was the real deal and, no, I was not in on the kidnapping. I had no time to react. It was all over very quickly. I pity the poor guy who was bundled into the boot because the guys who took him looked big and menacing.’   

The man in the vest and rather too tight shorts grabs the young man and forces him to the floor. The man in the white T-shirt and the one in the Adidas top look on

The other two men look initially bemused as their friend grabs the young man but then decide to join in

Then getting in on the 'action', one opens the boot while the others bundle the young man inside

After mistakenly putting the car into reverse, the driver shoots off up the road with Artem Mailov, 22, continuing to film the 'incident'

A police spokesman said: ‘We have to take it seriously as a potential crime and are now appealing to social media users to ask if they can identify either the men or the car or the victim.

‘The only reservation we have is that the video seems too perfect and that it might have been a set up. We won't know that until all our enquiries have been exhausted.’ 

Mr Mailov added: ‘I think it's real, I hope the police find him – and in one piece.'
