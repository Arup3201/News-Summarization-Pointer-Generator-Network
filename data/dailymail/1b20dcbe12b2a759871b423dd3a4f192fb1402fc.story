Appearing relaxed and enjoying the warmer weather the Danish summer had to offer, Australian-born Crown Princess Mary was at ease playing the doting mother to her four children, princes Vincent and Christian and princesses Isabella and Josephine, at the royals' summer residence.

In their annual visit to Graasten Palace, in southern Denmark, the royals were less formally dressed to pose in a family portrait for domestic and international media.

Crown Princess Mary, who hails from Tasmania, wore a sheer printed dress over a shorter mint-green slip as she held hands with her daughters, Princess Isabella, 7, and Josephine, 3.

The whole Danish family were at the summer residence, including Australian-born Crown Princess Mary, her husband Crown Prince Frederik and their children, Prince Christian, Princess Isabella, Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine

Her husband, Crown Prince Frederik, walked alongside his wife on the lawns of the palace - located in Denmark's southern region of Jutland - carrying his son, Prince Vincent, 3, while their fourth child, Prince Christian, 8, walked ahead with his cousins.

The brood were also flanked by other members of the Danish royal family - including Queen Margrethe, Prince Henrik, Prince Joachim, Princess Marie, Prince Nikolai, Prince Felix, Prince Henrik and Princess Athena.

The gracious royals posed for the media on a wooden footbridge with white-painted railings which went over a small creek.

One of the younger royals was put on the shoulders of Prince Joachim and raised both hands up in the air as photographers snapped away.

All the Danish royals were less formally dressed than they usually were for official duties, with Queen Margrethe - Prince Frederik's mother - donning a white button up shirt and white skirt accessorising the ensemble with a pink belt with a gold clasp.

While her son, Prince Frederik styled a salt-and-pepper beard with a white shirt, beige shorts and a pair of grey suede loafers.

The royals were at Graasten Palace for their annual visit during the summer months.

The first version of the palace was used as a hunting lodge and was constructed in the middle of the 1500s.

Unfortunately, it burned down in 1603 but a new palace was built near where the south wing of the current palace is located.

According to The Danish Monarchy website, the state acquired the palace in 1920 and it was then used as a court house used as living quarters for judges and police chiefs as well as a library.

But after extensive renovations in the year 1935, Graasten Palace became the summer residence for the then-Crown Prince couple who would later be known as King Frederik IX and Queen Ingrid.

After Queen Ingrid’s death, the palace was inherited by Queen Margrethe who has continued the tradition of using it as a summer house for her family.

It was a family affair on Thursday at the royal's summer residence in Graasten in Denmark
