A heroic rescuer who 
risked his life by leaping on to an out of control speedboat that killed
a father and daughter was yesterday back on the water working as a watersports instructor.

Charlie Toogood, 32, jumped from his own rib into the £60,000 vessel which had thrown the six members of the Milligan 
family into the Camel estuary on Sunday - leaving two of them dead and two 
severely injured.

Officials praised his actions, saying there would certainly have been more fatalities without Mr Toogood's help.

The former RNLI volunteer yesterday returned to his day job, back on the waters where the tragedy happened.

Back at work: Charlie Toogood, 32, was yesterday back working as a watersports instructor on the waters where he jumped on to an out of control speedboat and cut the engine - preventing further fatalities

Tragedy: The Milligan family, with father Nick holding eight-year-old Emily, left, both of whom lost their lives in the speedboat crash in Padstow on Sunday. Victoria, 41, Kit, four, Olivia, 10, and Amber 12, are in hospital

An onlooker at the Camel Estuary off Padstow, Cornwall, told the Daily Mirror: 'He looked deep in thought and just went about his business.

'Charlie was wearing a life-jacket and 
jeans and his route across the estuary took him near the area where he 
boarded the empty speedboat as it went round in circles causing such 
terrible mayhem.

'But I don’t think he was looking at the scenery – he just seemed to be concentrating on steering the boat across the estuary.'

BSkyB boss Nick Milligan, 51, and his daughter Emily, eight, died after being thrown in the water with the rest of their family on Sunday.

Hero: Watersports instructor Charlie Toogood brought a runaway speedboat under control in Padstow and saved the lives of four members of a family

The out-of-control speedboat was circling the family, slicing them with its lethal propeller blades. 

Mr Milligan's yoga teacher wife Victoria, 39, and their son Kit, four, were left with 'life-changing' leg injuries and are still being treated in hospital. The couple's other daughters Olivia, 10, and Amber, 12, were also injured in the water.

But Mr Toogood's quick thinking when he first spotted the speedboat was out of control prevented further fatalities.

The watersports instructor and a friend sped to the rescue of the boat after seeing them in the sea off Padstow in Cornwall.

They drew level with the stricken vessel as it raced round in circles, allowing Mr Toogood to jump into it.

He then managed to stop the engine and halt the boat.

Mr Toogood was an RNLI crew volunteer at Rock lifeboat station for eight 
years - and only finished two years ago because of business commitments.

He is a married father of a five-month-old daughter and runs the Camel Ski School, 
which rents out equipment for Cornish holidaymakers.

He yesterday spoke about the incident for the first time, and said that it was important to remember the those who died or were hurt in the tragedy.

'There were many "heroes" in this tragic incident, all of whom did a remarkable job in difficult circumstances,' he said in a statement through the RNLI.

'However, now is a time to solely reflect on the bereaved and injured family members and their wider family and friends.

'My thoughts are with them all and will be for a long time to come.

'I have nothing more to add and would hope that our community can now be
left to deal with this tragedy in own own way and in peace and quiet.'

Danger: The boat was completely out of control following the incident in Padstow, Cornwall, on Bank Holiday Sunday

Mr Milligan's brother Nick yesterday said the family was 'as well as can be hoped' in a brief statement outside their London home.

'The investigation is on going. The family is doing as well as they can,' the 53-year-old said.

Asked about the condition of Mr Milligan’s wife Victoria and son Kit, Mr Milligan said: 'They are still being treated.

'I’ve seen the children, they’re all doing as well as you can hope for'.

He added that 'lots of people have been very understanding' when asked about the support offered to the family.

He said he was at his brother’s detached house situated next to Wandsworth Common, 'to handle (his brother’s) affairs'.

Instructor: Mr Toogood, 32, intervened to prevent further disaster after the speedboat killed two people

Experienced: Mr Toogood runs his own business hiring out boats to holidaymakers in Cornwall

Mr Toogood's actions are credited with saving the lives of Nick Milligan’s remaining family, with police and coastguards having
praised Mr Toogood’s ‘incredible seamanship and bravery’ which prevented
further tragedy during the horrifying accident.

Matt Pavitt, from the North Cornwall Coastguard, said: ‘He managed to manoeuvre his boat alongside the vessel which was going round and round in circles, picked his moment and jumped.’

Detective Superintendent Jim Colwell added: ‘Without the brave and heroic efforts of local people and holidaymakers in the minutes immediately after this incident in assisting the family while they were in the water, I’m confident that this would have been far worse in terms of the overall death toll.’ 

Mr Toogood, a married father in his early 30s, had previously declined to talk about his heroics but his mother Sarah said he was ‘in a bit of a state’.

Another friend added: ‘He is devastated. Everyone is rightly calling  him a hero, but he felt he was helpless that he couldn’t do more to save the others.’

Teenager Will Jones was named as the 
helmsman of Mr Toogood’s boat. His sister Amy said: ‘My brother is still
very shaken up from it all.’

Hundreds
of holidaymakers watched in horror as the speedboat then raced round in
circles, its propeller slashing the helpless victims and turning the 
water 'red with blood'.

Mr Jones, 19, later wrote on Facebook: 'After today the next few days are going to be very difficult to process. Thoughts are with those who are involved in the accident.'

Maria Chase wrote on Facebook: 'We 
were down in Padstow today and saw the tragedy and saw a hero who saved 
more lives by jumping on to an out-of-control speedboat from another 
boat.

'He deserves a medal, whoever he was.'

Another, Charlotte Jacobs, wrote to 
the RNLI on Twitter: 'We witnessed incredible bravery in Padstow today 
during the tragic accident that unfolded. The men involved deserve 
medals.'
