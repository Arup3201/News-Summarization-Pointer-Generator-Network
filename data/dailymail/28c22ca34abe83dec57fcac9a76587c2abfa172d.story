The sun and warm weather will make a welcome return across the country over the next couple of days as areas devastated by yesterday's flash floods continue the clear-up.

Forecasters said expected heavy showers overnight had subsided and much of the country today would enjoy warm, sunny spells, although temperatures are unlikely to soar to the same highs as last week.

Flash floods devastated large areas of Britain yesterday as torrential rain damaged houses, overwhelmed rail stations and stranded residents in their homes.

The deluge, which saw more than half a month’s rain fall in an hour in parts of East Anglia, the South East and London, caused chaos for commuters and emergency services.

The mercury in London hit 27C today while the rest of the country was expected to bask in temperatures reaching the mid-twenties 

The hail and thunderstorms were described
 as a 'zombie apocalypse' by one rail company and meant commuters faced 
major disruption after tracks were damaged.

The Environment Agency removed flood warnings today and said flooding was not expected during the next three days.

But
 while temperatures will remain warm, a second spell of wet weather is 
expected to arrive on Friday night, forecasters warned.

Helen Roberts, a forecaster for Met Office, said today would be 'much quieter' than yesterday.

'Generally there's quite a lot of dry and fine weather across the UK but we do have a weak
 frontal system pushing its way through bringing with it cloud and a few
 spots of rain, mainly affecting the north of England.

'It's not a bad day at all for most parts.'

John
 Lee, a forecaster for MeteoGroup, said: 'That rain we had in the South East will clear this morning and many areas will have a dry and 
fine day with sunny spells. It will not be as warm as it has been but we
 could see highs of 27C.

Mr Lee said: 'There will be bits and pieces of rain in the North West and Scotland, but it is not going to come to much.

'In the next couple of days in the South it’s staying dry with sunshine but it is not going to be hot like a week ago.

'There will
 be a mix of temperatures, mainly around 26C (78.8F) which is four to 
five degrees down but it will still be pleasantly warm.

'There will be rain in places, particularly in the North but even the rain is not heavy.

'Heading towards Friday and the weekend it will start to get more unsettled.'

The Met 
Office said tomorrow is expected to remain fine and dry with sunny 
spells, although Thursday will see showers in the north and west.

The 
weather is then forecast to turn on Friday and Saturday with all areas 
receiving sunny spells and scattered heavy showers.

Meanwhile,
 the Met Office said 43mm of rain - more than half the average monthly 
total for England in July - fell in an hour in Great Dunmow, Essex, 
between 4am and 5am yesterday.

As warm weather draws crowds to local swimming spots across the country, the dangerous 'tombstoning' trend has left a boy in hospital fighting for his life.

The 8-year-old today remains in a critical condition with severe head injuries after jumping from a waterfall in Keighley, West Yorkshire.

The activity tombstoning - named so because the jumper attempts to enter the water upright like a tombstone - is a deadly sport popular with teenagers.

Since 2005 there have been 20 deaths and 76 serious injuries caused by tombstoning in the UK, according to coastguard figures.

The boy was playing with older children at Tinker Bridge in Braithwaite around noon on Sunday when he fell into the water, striking his head as he fell, and did not resurface.

Emergency services staff rescued the boy and took him to Leeds General Infirmary, where he remains in a critical condition.

A lightning strike at a sub-station in Hove, Sussex, sparked disruption for rail passengers travelling between Worthing and Hove and Brighton during the morning rush hour, while firefighters rescued people from homes and cars hit by floods.

Brighton station tweeted: 'At a stand west coastway Worthing Brighton. Both ways due to zombie apocalypse.'

London Fire Brigade rescued two drivers and their passengers from their cars in separate incidents after they became stuck in flood water in north-west London, while 20 houses were flooded in Bedford Road, Ruislip.

Essex Fire and Rescue Service said it dealt with 20 incidents in Thaxted, following flash flooding, including the rescue of five people from three neighbouring houses which were flooded.

The AA said it attended 34 flood-related call outs, mostly around west London and West Sussex, as East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service received 300 calls within just a few hours.

A further 60 calls had to be passed to colleagues in Cambridgeshire as the storms swept in, causing a surge in 999 calls.

Meanwhile, a series of remarkable photographs taken on Friday show a group dolphins jumping and performing for swimmers at a Cornwall beach.

Tourist Mary-Anne Drabble took out her mobile phone to snap pictures of the 'breathtaking experience' and said she was in tears as she watched the dolphins play

Eventually a helicopter was used by lifeguards to shoo the dolphins away after their impromptu performance

Tourist Mary-Anne Drabble, 41, quickly took out her mobile phone to snap pictures of the dolphins ducking and diving beneath the waves.

She said: 'It was a breathtaking experience - I was actually crying at what I saw.

'Everyone on the beach was cheering as they jumped out of the water. I think the dolphins were showing off for everyone.'

Dolphins have been seen closer to the British coastline as sea temperatures soared to as much as 21C (70F) over the weekend.

Mrs Drabble, of Ashby-de-la-Zouch in Leicestershire, said lifeguards eventually shooed the dolphins away from swimmers.

'The lifeguards urged people to stay away from them and started trying to encourage the dolphins to swim back out to open water. A helicopter flew above the water to force the dolphins to go away.'
