Former Manchester United defender Gerard Pique has hailed Manchester City as one of the best teams in the world, but insists he is confident his Barcelona side will get a 'decent result' when the teams meat on Tuesday.

Barcelona arrived in Manchester on Monday off the back of a disappointing defeat to Malaga, but Pique claims they have no fear ahead of the Champions League last-16 clash.

The defender admitted that City have been unlucky in Europe's premier competition, but said that they had proved their quality domestically.

'They had really bad luck in the draw,' said Pique. 'They had a really difficult group stage. In the Premier League they are showing they are one of the best teams in the world.

'We know this team can play to a great standard. The fans will be right behind City. We will have to take the game to them. I’m sure we will get a decent result here.' 

Pique picked out his international team-mate David Silva as City's danger man, but admitted he is looking forward to playing in Manchester again.

'Silva is the one that makes them tick,' he said. 'He is a fantastic player. Even when he was at Valencia, he had brutal technical quality.

'It’s always exciting to come back to this city. The fans here are magnificent. I have got positive memories that is all. It was always great playing in derby matches at both grounds.'

City boss Manuel Pellegrini however seemed to disagree with Pique, labelling Sergio Aguero as the man to watch.

The Argentina striker sat out the first leg when the two sides met last February and could only manage 45 minutes at the Nou Camp. 

'I think that Sergio is one of the five top players in the world. When he is 100 per cent fit, it is very difficult to stop him. Last year he couldn’t play the way he wanted to do it. 

'Sergio is coming back from a long injury but between Everton he is adding minutes and seeing him against Stoke and Newcastle, I think he is in his best performance.'
