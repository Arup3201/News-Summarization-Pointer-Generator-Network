Shocking details continued to emerge yesterday of the behaviour of Libyan soldiers training in Britain as David Cameron insisted none of the cadets should be granted asylum here.

Tight security and armed military patrols were on duty last night at the Bassingbourn Barracks in Cambridgeshire with an astonishing total of around 300 UK soldiers in place.

They massively outnumber the 236 remaining Libyans, who are all due to go home tomorrow.

General Sir Nicholas Carter told MPs the behaviour of the Libyan cadets was 'beyond the pale'

David Cameron today hit out at the 'completely unacceptable' breakdown of discipline among Libyan soldiers in Cambridgeshire

Around 200 UK soldiers were involved in the training but a further 100 had to be drafted in last week to provide reinforcements while police patrols have been stepped up following allegations of a male rape and sexual attacks on three women in Cambridge.

Five cadets are in police custody facing sex charges after a series of violations described by Mr Cameron as ‘totally unacceptable’.

The head of the army today admitted the behaviour of Libyan soldiers who went on the rampage outside their barracks  was 'beyond the pale'.

General Sir Nicholas Carter's remarks came after an angry David Cameron demanded military top brass explain the 'unacceptable' breakdown of discipline  which saw hundreds of Libyan cadets sent home in disgrace amid allegations of rape, drunkenness, fighting and theft.

The Prime Minister said the the Government programme to train up Libya's army would be scrapped and all the trainees based in Britain deported.

Two thousand Libyan cadets – hand-picked by the British Army – were supposed to be given leadership skills in the UK to help their war-torn country. 

Toppling Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi has allowed an ‘even worse’ regime to take over, Ukip’s Mark Reckless has claimed.

Mr Reckless, the party’s candidate in Rochester and Strood in the upcoming by-election, said Gaddafi had been good at controlling immigration.

The former MP, who defected from the Conservative party in September, said African migrants were being ‘waved through Italy’ and then headed for Calais to cross the Channel for Britain.

Mr Reckless was speaking at a public meeting in Rochester, where UKIP is hoping to win its second seat in the House of Commons. The issue of immigration is becoming a key battleground for the General Election.

He said: ‘Whatever people say about Gaddafi, one thing is he didn't allow those boats to come across.

‘He had an agreement with Italy that stopped it. Since he's gone we've no idea what's going on in Libya, it's too dangerous for anyone to go there.’

He said that since Gaddafi’s regime had fallen the ‘bad guys’ were being replaced by ‘even worse guys’.

He added: ‘We bombed them, that's what we did. That's how this government helped Libya. It got rid of somebody, albeit an Arab nationalist dictator, who actually gave a level of stability to the area.’

But the scheme has been beset by difficulties from the start - with trainees allowed to run amok outside their barracks in Cambridgeshire.

At Prime Minister’s Questions today, Mr Cameron told MPs what had happened at Bassingbourn, Cambridgeshire, was ‘completely unacceptable’.

He said: ‘These are criminal actions and I’ve asked fort the chief of the defence staff to look into this.’

Mr Cameron said the training had been scrapped altogether, adding: ‘The trainees will be returning to Libya in the coming days. In the meantime all unescorted visits from the camp have been stopped altogether.’  

Since the training course began in June, Libyan cadets hunted down and sexually assaulted three women in one night - while another two  trainees have been charged with raping a man in a park.

General discipline collapsed, with one in ten refusing to obey orders - with one UK trainer reportedly headbutted and another apparently threatened by a Libyan mob. 

General Carter told MPs the alleged attacks were ‘completely beyond the pale’ and ‘absolutely regrettable’ as he appeared before the Commons defence select committee.

But the Chief of the General Staff said: ‘The Bassingbourn site is not a prison camp. It is extraordinarily difficult to control it, in that sense.’

He added that he knew some of the Libyans had sought political asylum. Asked if thought that was appropriate, he replied: ‘No, probably not.’

To add further insult it has emerged that the Libyan government still owe millions of pounds for the training of their soldiers.

In April, Mr Cameron wrote to Mr Zidan’s successor, Abdullah al-Thinni, urging him to make the payments.

The Prime Minister pledged the UK’s continuing support but added: ‘I understand that you have been working personally to take forward the General Purpose Force Programme and that plans are now advanced for some 360 recruits to come to the UK in May.

‘I hope that it will be possible to resolve quickly the remaining issues relating to contract and payment, given the overall importance of this programme to our shared goal of improving stability and security.’

The call for extra troops to restore order came from police last week. Units of the 2 Scots, the Royal Highland Fusiliers, were sent in to Bassingbourn Barracks, near Royston, after their leave was cancelled.

 

Last night, the Ministry of Defence announced the 24-week course was ending early and the 325 cadets would be sent home.

The future of the entire programme – scheduled to cover 2,000 trainees – is in doubt amid protests from furious locals.

One of the Libyan cadets due to be sent home blamed Britain yesterday for the difficulties at the Bassingbourn Barracks, claiming ‘they didn’t tell us the difference between what’s right and wrong here’.

Omar Al-Mukhtar, who is not one of the men accused of the assaults, added: ‘They didn’t tell us about British law.’ He alleged that when trainees had been allowed out on accompanied visits of three hours a week they had been offered drugs, alcohol and sex for money. He did not say who by.

Asked if the recruits had a message for the British government he said: ‘Not to take things too seriously.’

Speaking to the BBC, Mr Al-Mukhtar said he and other Libyans were proud to have graduated from the course at Bassingbourn, and were very happy with the training they received.

But some cadets were unhappy with life on the base and how they had been treated, claiming ‘people’ were out to ruin the reputation of the Libyan army.

Mr Al-Mukhtar alleged that when the cadets were arrested and their comrades went to ask authorities at the base what was happening, they were given no information.

He said the cadets believed the arrested men were ‘unlawfully treated’, adding: ‘We blame the British authorities.’ He admitted there had been a ‘small fight’ between cadets but far more between Libyan and British soldiers.

Andrew Lansley, a former Tory health secretary who had initially supported the scheme, said: ‘As this stands, no further groups of trainees could be brought here from Libya.’

He said the MoD must be held accountable for ‘a serious failure’. Mr Lansley said about 10 per cent of the cadets ‘were not accepting the discipline and weren’t accepting what they were asked to do and were not becoming part of a military force’.

‘They were looking to take whatever advantage they could,’ he added. ‘It has meant recently that there has been a lot of additional resources by the MoD to try and shore it up and give protection. It is all very disappointing. We wanted it to work and for it to make a contribution in Libya. I am unhappy.’

The demand for answers came after Cambridge magistrates were told how three of the cadets had behaved ‘like a pack’ as they hunted down and sexually assaulted three women in one night.

Ibrahim Naji El Maarfi, 20, and Mohammed Abdalsalam, 27, left their barracks on stolen bicycles and cycled to Cambridge where they stalked their victims under the cover of darkness. The city’s magistrates were told how they touched them sexually and attempted to put their hands up their skirts.

El Maarfi pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual assault, one count of exposure and one count of theft.

They will be sentenced at Cambridge Crown Court at a later date. 

A third man, Khaled El Azibi, 18, who was charged with three counts of sexual assault and one count of theft,is yet to enter a plea. 

In another incident, Moktar Ali Saad Mahmoud, 33, and Ibrahim Abogutila, 22, have been charged with the rape of a man in a Cambridge park.

An estimated £2.5million was spent refurbishing Bassingbourn to host the series of courses conducted by members of 3 Scots, the Black Watch.

Peter Robinson, who chairs the parish council, said: ‘I thought Muslims didn’t drink but there has been a run on vodka in the local shop. That’s their favourite trip – going to the Spar and then stealing bicycles.’

Downing Street confirmed that the Libyan soldiers are eligible to seek asylum in the UK before they are kicked out.

The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘Asylum rules apply to everyone. It will be the existing asylum rules that apply.’
