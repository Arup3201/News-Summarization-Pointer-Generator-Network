Manchester United keeper David de Gea is a well-known admirer of heavy metal.

And the Spaniard re-emphasised that on Tuesday evening when he tweeted a picture from Manchester Arena of American band Slipknot in action.

De Gea posted a picture of the rockband with the comment attached: 'Amazing concert!!!'

Many on the social networking site were shocked at the 24-year-old's taste of music, with well over a thousand people retweeting the image.

Last season in an interview with Manchester United's website he revealed his love for heavy metal saying: 'When I put it on in the dressing room, everyone moans. Most of the other players are into hip-hop.'

Ironically, De Gea's girlfriend, Edurne Garcia, is a popstar too.
