Disheveled: Andrew Nisbet, 31, has been arrested for sexually abusing at least two boys while working as a golf instructor in Livermore, California

A well known youth golf coach in San Francisco has been arrested on his own course and charged with 65 counts of pedophila after allegedly assaulting two male students - one as young as 12 - over a three-year period.

Andrew Nisbet, 31, who is married, tutored students at Las Positas Golf Course in Livermore and was arrested on Saturday - the day before he was due to receive a PGA award for coach of the year at the prestigious Contra Costa Country Club.

Police have said they expect many more victims to come forward during their investigation and he is currently being held in Santa Rita Jail without bail - while officers collect evidence from his home, which is next-door to an elementary school.

The 49-page complaint filed on Tuesday by the Alameda County District Attorney's Office said Nisbet, who also operates the GRIP Junior Golf Academy which has 175 students, is accused of performing oral sex on his victims in his car from December 2009 through March 2012 and showing them pornography on his phone.

The complaint also alleges that other sex acts were committed by Nisbet in the golf clubs parking lot and during out-of-town golfing excursions.

Livermore Police officer Steve Goard said that authorities became aware of the allegations when one of Nisbet's golf students reported that he was abused in November.

Worrying: Nisbet was arrested at Las Positas Golf Course in Livermore - the day before he was due to receive the prestigious PGA's 2013 Junior Golf Leader Award

Las Positas Golf Course have announced he has been fired since his arrest.

'He befriended them as the cool coach, gave them rides to and from practice and bought them gifts, including top-of-the-line golf equipment,' Goard said to the San Jose Mercury News.

'He created a coach-athlete bond and, as he did, was figuring out who he could get away with it with.'

Nisbet was taken into custody at 10 am on the golf course while he was working and during his initial interview police said that he admitted some lewd acts with the children.

His wife of two years, Kimberly Patrick Nisbet, has not commented on the allegations and appears to have moved out of the family home in Livermore, which is next door to Jackson Elementary School.

On Tuesday, Livermore police said that they were continuing their investigation and said it was probable that more charges will be brought against Nisbet - who has been teaching at Las Positas since 2006.

'We're in the process of interviewing two other local victims, and we've been led to believe there are possible victims in Michigan and other states,' Goard said to the San Jose Mercury News.

'He traveled all over -- to North Carolina and Southern California for a lot of PGA-sponsored events.'

Nisbet appeared in ourt on Tuesday in front of one of the alleged victim's parents who they said he been coaching their son for eight years.

Nisbet's own parents were in court as well on Tuesday to watch their son being charged with 65 counts of pedophilia.

According to his biography online, Nisbet majored in professional golf management at Mississippi State University and had worked as a golf pro at The Country Club of Birmingham in Alabama and Beech Woods Golf Course in Southfield, Michigan.

It also claims he is 'one of the only Top 50 US Kids Golf Master Teachers in Northern California.'

Neighbor Jeremy West said he saw detectives at Nesbit's Jackson Avenue home on Saturday.

'There's going to be some people freaking out in the neighborhood,' West said to NBC News. 'I don't want to see him again. He doesn't need to be around here.'

Livermore police said that as a nationally acclaimed golf coach, Nisbet would have had access to hundreds of kids and used his position to sexually assault at least three of them - and that number is likely to grow.

'We have been giving information that he potentially victimized children in Michigan, Alabama, Mississippi and North Carolina,' Goard said.

'And some of the kids were victimized at these golf events.'

Calls to Nisbet's attorney seeking comment were not returned.
