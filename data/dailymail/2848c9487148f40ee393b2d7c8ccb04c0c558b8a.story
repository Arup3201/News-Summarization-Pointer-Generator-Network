A furious Los Angeles Clippers star has begged his 262,000 followers for help tracking down the man who is accused of  murdered his aunt.

Matt Barnes, a 34-year-old small forward, told his fans: 'This dude stabbed my auntie in the neck last week & left her for dead on the sidewalk, she ended up dying on the way to the hospital in the ambulance.'

The family of his aunt, Tanganyika Williams, 38, meanwhile, has created a GoFundMe page to raise $5,000 to pay for her funeral.

Before the start of last season, Barnes signed a three-year, $10.2million contract with the Clippers.

On Twitter and Instragram on Tuesday, Barnes posted a picture of the suspect, 51-year-old Michael Williams.

Williams is accused of murdering his estranged wife, Tanganyika Williams, 38, after a fight at their Sacramento, California, home on July 8.

Police identified Michael Williams as the suspect in the murder, but he fled the scene and police have not been able to find him, the Sacramento Bee reports.

He is believed to be hiding out on the streets of Sacramento. 

It's not clear whether Michael Williams is also related to Barnes.

Barnes grew up in a suburb of Sacramento before finding basketball stardom.

He is married to Gloria Govan, who appeared in VH1 reality shows Basketball Wives and Basketball Wives: LA. They have twin sons.
