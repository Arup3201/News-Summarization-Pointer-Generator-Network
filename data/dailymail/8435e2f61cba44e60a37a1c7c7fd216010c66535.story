Cristiano Ronaldo made his commute to work look easy when he set off for Real Madrid training in his £330,000 white Rolls-Royce Ghost on Wednesday morning.

The three-time Ballon d'Or winner left for the club's training ground in style as Carlo Ancelotti prepares his men for their La Liga match against Athletic Bilbao on Saturday evening. 

Ronaldo scored his 30th league goal in Real's last game against Villarreal but could not prevent them from dropping two points in the title race with a 1-1 draw at the Bernabeu.

With 12 games left Ronaldo is now just one goal from his tally for last season, and the former Manchester United star has become the first player in history from the big five leagues to score 30 goals per season for a fifth consecutive year.

Yet Real remain just two points clear of  Barcelona at the top of La Liga with a trip to the  Nou Camp on March 22 approaching.

Real must see off 10th-placed Bilbao on Saturday before turning their attention to the Champions League just three days later.

They face Schalke in the second leg of their last-16 tie at home but carry a 2-0 advantage. It was at the Veltins Arena in Germany on February 18 that Ronaldo opened the scoring to put Real in a strong position to qualify for the quarter-finals.
