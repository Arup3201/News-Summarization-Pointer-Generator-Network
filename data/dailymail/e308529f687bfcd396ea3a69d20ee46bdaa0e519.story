John Crosse Brooks collected autographs of 19th century figureheads

For John Crosse Brooks, autograph collecting was in the blood.

His uncle had started what was to become the family hobby - with a pardon document signed by Queen 
Elizabeth I and forms signed by Charles I and II, James II and 
George I.

Now, 19th century shipowner Brooks's collection, which features a Who's Who of historic figures - such as Byron, William Wordsworth and Florence Nightingale - has gone on display.

Over his lifetime, Brooks amassed 26 vellum-bound volumes containing the signatures of the rich and famous from across the centuries.

The shipowner wrote to leading lights
of the time or bought historic documents with signatures of notable 
figures to bolster his collection.

He brought in signatures of US Presidents Abraham Lincoln and George Washington, along with Prime Ministers, Gladstone and Disraeli.

He organised his signatures and photographs into categories such as eminent men, churchmen, peers, commoners, bishops, kings, queens and US presidents.

When he died in 1897, he left the volumes to the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne, of which he was vice-president.

Now a selection of his collection has been digitised and can be read by visitors to an exhibition which opens tomorrow at the Great North Museum in Newcastle to mark the 200th anniversary of the society.

His collection, which had been started 
by his uncle, includes a pardon document signed by Queen Elizabeth I and
documents signed by Charles I and II, James II and George I.

Other scoops are Captain Bligh from HMS Bounty and an expenses claim with signatures of the ship's officers, and a document signed by explorer Captain James Cook.

There is a letter signed by Florence Nightingale asking for supplies of soap, and others with signatures ranging from Charles Darwin to Alfred Lord Tennyson and William Wordsworth.

North East figures include Lord Armstrong, George Stephenson, Admiral Lord Collingwood and miners' leader Thomas Burt.

Society president Lindsay Allason-Jones said: 'It was the autographs of famous people he was after and if he could find a portrait he included that, such as Lord Byron who had signed an etching of himself in the same way as celebrities today sign a photograph.

'As well as the signatures, the documents he acquired add up to being a very historically important collection.'

Mr Crosse Brooks' first job was as a draughtsman in the timber-ship building yard of William Rea at Walker on the Tyne.

He subsequently became a part-owner and manager of ships and for many years he lived in Wallsend, but moved to Lovaine Place in Newcastle in 1882.

He was a also a collector of coins, medals, tradesmen's tokens, pictures and engravings.
