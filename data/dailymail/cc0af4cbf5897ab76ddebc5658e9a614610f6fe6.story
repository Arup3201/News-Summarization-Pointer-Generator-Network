A German nurse today admitted to killing 30 patients in his care because he was 'bored' and wanted to show off his 'excellent' resuscitation skills.

Nils. H., 38, is being tried for three specimen murders by injecting patients with a dangerous medicine.

The ex-nurse went on trial in Oldenburg in northern Germany in September and today claimed responsibility for dozens of deaths at the clinic he worked at.

After he was arrested, the nurse explained to police 'I was bored' - and prosecutors say he was keen to show off his CPR skills.

According to the prosecution, if the first attempt at resuscitation was a success, he would sometimes make a second attempt.

The nurse, whose full name is withheld under German privacy laws, used Gilurytmal, a medication which should only be used by doctors under strict supervision, it was said. 

Side effects include an irregular heartbeat, a drop in blood pressure and uncoordinated functioning of the heart muscle.

Prosecutors in the district court of Oldenburg said Nils. H. (pictured) could be involved in more than 150 deaths

Though the nurse is facing charges over three murders and two attempted murders, the state prosecutor said he could be involved in more than 150 deaths.

In cooperation with the police, the state prosecutor is currently investigating the deaths of 174 patients who died during Nils. H.'s shifts  at a clinic in Delmenhorst, near Bremen, between 2003 and 2005.

The investigators will also look into deaths at Nils. H.'s previous jobs in Oldenburg and Wilhelmshaven and dozens of bodies will be exhumed.

In 2008, Nils. H. was  sentenced to seven-and-a-half years for the attempted murder of another patient.

He gave his patient an overdose of heart medication, with the man narrowly escaping death.

The death rate in the Delmenhorst clinic nearly doubled in the time Nils. H. worked there, and use of the heart medication also increased dramatically. 

But it took nearly a decade before an investigation was launched, angering relatives of the dead who are demanding information.

A senior doctor who gave evidence in September said Nils. H. was a 'passionate medic' who made a good impression on staff at the clinic.

But the doctor added: 'I found it strange that he was always on hand when patients were being resuscitated, often helping younger doctors with intubation - inserting a breathing tube into a patient's airways.'

'No one wants to believe that a colleague would rather kill patients, instead of helping them,' said Erich Joester, a lawyer for the clinic.

He said that the increased death rate had been attributed to a number of causes rather than a rogue individual.
