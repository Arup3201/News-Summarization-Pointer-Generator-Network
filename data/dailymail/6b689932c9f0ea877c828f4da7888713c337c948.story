Defeat has seldom tasted so sweet. The king might not necessarily still be the king but he is definitely back and ready to fight to reclaim his crown.

That was the reaction from the Sprinter Sacre team as the horse still rated the best steeplechaser in Britain finished three-lengths second to Dodging Bullets in the Grade One Clarence House Chase at Ascot.

Jockey Barry Geraghty and trainer Nicky Henderson could be accused of peering through rose-tinted spectacles but, equally, they also had a heap of reasons to view the run with a healthy dose of optimism.

This was, after all, Sprinter Sacre’s first run for 386 days and his first voyage into competitive action since being pulled up at Kempton 13 months ago with a heart problem that threatened to end the career of the seven-time grade one winning chaser.

There were also concerns that the frightening experience may have left a mental scare on 2013 Queen Mother Champion Chase winner, whose jumping got noticeably more exuberant as the race progressed.

It was hardly surprising a noticeable nervous hush shrouded the parade ring before the two-mile contest which was replaced after it by a rush of relief, most notably from the trainer and not diluted by the subsequent news that the nine-year-old had suffered a ‘low level’ bleed from the nose after veterinary examination.

Henderson, who had agonised all week about running Sprinter Sacre on ground he feared would be worse than the eventual Soft going, said: ’We are not trying to sweep that under the carpet but do not think (the bleed) is significant.

Nicky Henderson, trainer of Sprinter Sacre, said his horse ' travelled well but got a little bit tired' at Ascot

‘He proved it is still there. I have seen lots of positive. He just got a bit tired.

‘You would not send your player out and play 90 minutes first time out. You would probably take him off after 60.

‘This morning I would have taken that (result) and, turning for home, I thought I was going to take a bit better

‘It was still a great performance because it has been hard work. In October and November, we weren’t exactly blooming but things are coming together at the right time. We are on the right road and I am fairly optimistic about that.’

Dodging Bullets leads from the front early on with Sprinter Sacre and Barry Geraghty giving chase

Hopes of an immediate return to winning ways have been elevated when Sprinter Sacre loomed up seeming to be travelling best on the home turn.

But eventual fourth Somersby and AP McCoy had set out make this two-mile contest as big a test of stamina as possible and it worked. 

Geraghty had Sprinter Sacre in front before the second last fence but Paul Nicholls-trained, Noel Fehily-ridden Tingle Creek Chase winner Dodging Bullet had overtaken him strides after it and Geraghty was never going to ask his mount too serious a question in the in finals hard yards.

Geraghty said: ‘All of a sudden I felt him tread water a bit. But he is bound to get tired, he has been off a year and we went a really good gallop.

Geraghty admits he was beaten fair and square but is confident today's run will help Sprinter Sacre improve

‘We were beaten fair and square on the day but you’d imagine with a run under his belt he will improve. Bar winning, I could not be any happier.’

Sponsors Betway now make Sprinter Sacre 3-1 joint favourite with 2014 winner Sire De Grugy for this season’s renewal at the Cheltenham Festival in March.

The latter must himself prove he has recovered from an injury in the Game Spirit Chase at Newbury on February 7. 

Geraghty was more than happy with the way Sprinter Sacre performed on the Ascot track after a lay-off
