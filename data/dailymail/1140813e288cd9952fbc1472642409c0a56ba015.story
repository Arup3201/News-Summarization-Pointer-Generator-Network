A stablehand 'who lost all control' was jailed for life yesterday for murdering his friend after he caught him having sex with his girlfriend.

Bryan Harris, 45, claimed he had been 'defending his dignity' as he punched and kicked victim Paul Drury over his betrayal.

Harris denied using a dented frying pan to carry out the violent attack on his 32-year-old victim before he also left lover Dawn Lewis with severe facial wounds in the house in Newton Abbot, Devon.

Mr Justice Evans jailed Harris for life with a minimum term of 18 years to serve behind bars.

He said: 'You beat him to death. You assaulted him with such ferocity it caused devastating and fatal injuries.

'Both were naked when the ambulancemen arrived. I therefore have to sentence you on that basis that your account of finding them together is true.

'However I am sure you never lost your self control.

'You decided to administer punishment beatings to seek revenge and to teach him a lesson.'

Miss Lewis, 46, said Harris has a strong sex drive but had not had sex with her for more than a month after she had had surgery.

She
told the jury at Exeter Crown Court that Harris - whom she had only 
been seeing for a few months - 'seemed to want it every day'.

Hours before the murder on November 13 last year, Harris had pestered her for sex but she refused despite his repeated attempts.

She
told the jury she cannot recall how she got her injuries and was 
confused as to whether she had had sex with Harris on that November 
night.

Initially in police interviews Harris insisted 
that two men and two women had burst into the house and launched the attack which he single handedly repelled.

But he now admitted that he was responsible for the assaults on his friend and his lover.

Harris told the jury in his evidence that he woke to find their room empty and Miss Lewis moaning.

He said: 'She was moaning in pleasure downstairs and Paul was naked on top of her and they were having sex on the floor of the living room.

'I said to Paul: "What are you doing?"

'I was shouting and swearing at him. He got off her and we exchanged words.

'I was very annoyed and hurt and being betrayed by him and Dawn. He told me he loved her too and said I'd used her for money. I told him I loved the girl.'

He admitted fighting Mr Drury and said: 'I was giving him a hiding to say 'keep off my missus'. I had lost all control. I did not realise how badly I had injured him.'

Harris denied using the bloodied frying pan as a weapon and said he punched and kicked Mr Drury for up to 15 minutes in a brutal beating.

Miss Lewis, who had taken a sleeping tablet, told the court that she could not recall having sex with Mr Drury.

She said: 'I am almost 100 per cent sure I didn't sleep with Drury, he was not a sexual person.'

Harris had denied murdering Mr Drury and attempting to cause grievous bodily harm to Miss Lewis with intent to do her grievous bodily harm.

Prosecutor Michael Fitton QC said Mr Drury died in a 'prolonged and brutal attack' which left him with multiple head and other injuries to his neck, jaw, ribs and ear. He suffered fatal brain wounds.

Mr Drury's family said he was a 'sensitive and generous individual' and they were content that Harris was locked up to prevent him unleashing other 'relentless and lethal attacks on other undeserving victims'.
