A serviceman who has been in Afghanistan for more than six months has finally met his newborn triplets for the first time.

Senior airman Harley Wicks was greeted by his relieved new family at the airport after a long and almost unbearable wait.

The military father has been on operations in the Middle East for six-and-a-half months and his three tiny children were born shortly after he departed for his tour of duty.

United: This is the moment serviceman Harley Wicks met his newborn triplets for he first time after more than six months in Afghanistan

Relieved mother Amber Wicks, paced up and down the airport terminal with her children to welcome home her husband after an agonising wait.

The three babies each wore special home-coming baby-grows, one of them read: 'Waited my whole life to meet my daddy.'

The final minutes waiting at the the airport terminal for wife Amber Wicks were almost unbearable

Long-awaited moment: Finally a smiling Mr Wicks came into view, about to meet his new family for the first time

Speaking
to U.S. news serviceÂ Krem.com, Mrs Wicks said her husband had missed all of 
the special moments of her pregnancy, including finding out that she was
going to have triplets, as well as the births.

Teary Mrs Wicks could hardly bare the excruciating last few minutes of the wait before her husband eventually walked out from arrivals.

After a long hug, he was introduced to
his new family for the first time as shocked and delighted onlookers 
also enjoyed the moment.

Relief: The couple embraced before the father's first introduction to his new children

Getting to know each other: The new father seemed to be a source of fascination for the newborn babies

Shocked: Onlookers at the airport also enjoyed the special moment

'I knew they were going to be little, but this is extra little,' he told Krem.com.

It's going to take some adjusting for the Air Force serviceman, and hardest bit, he told the news service, will be 'trying to take care of three at once, but it's a challenge I'm looking forward to,' he said.

Finally united, the family will spend two weeks in the Spokane area, Washington, with Mrs Wicks' family before returning back to their military-base home, in Little Rock, Arkansas.

She said: 'I feel so much better now that he's here,' said Mrs Wicks, 'we've been waiting for this for a long time.'

Fascinated: The children were on their best behaviour when their father finally arrived and seemed mesmerised by him

The happy family will spend the next two weeks with Mrs Wicks' relatives before returning to their military base home to settle in

Challenging: Mr Wicks said looking after all three at once will be challenging, but he was looking forward to it
