Usain Bolt came under fire from Scots today after he reportedly claimed the Commonwealth Games are 'a bit s***' and the Olympics 'were better'.

The world's fastest man arrived in Scotland on Saturday and was expected to compete in the 4x100m relay for Jamaica this weekend.

But Scottish fans are predicting the 100m sprint champion will get a frosty reception if he appears before the crowd in Glasgow after a report of his off-hand comments emerged.

Bolt and his manager today denied he had criticised the Games, with the sprinter branding the report 'nonsense'.

The sprinter has since denied making the comments, calling the reports 'nonsense' on Twitter

The Times claimed this morning that Bolt was waiting for his car when he said the Games were 'a bit s***' and the Olympics 'were better'.

The paper said that the world-famous runner was outside the athletes' village in Glasgow last night when he uttered the judgment.

Bolt had spent the afternoon with Prince William, Prince Harry and the Duchess of Cambridge, chatting and posing for photographs.

There
 was a backlash against the star on Twitter this morning, with some 
predicting a tough reception for the sprinter when he competes on Saturday.

Others said the comments would be a blow to those who 
had worked hard to organise the event.

Shona
 Robison, the Scottish National Party's cabinet member for the Games, 
told the BBC: 'We need to establish if Usain Bolt has said this and what
 he has said.

'The feedback from the athletes - I was in the village the other day - they are having a great time. They have really praised the facilities.'

Scots turned on the star this morning, with GP Gregor Smith (above) and Glaswegian Bella Flowers (below) saying the comments would be a slap in the face for those who hope the Games will get children into sport

Others made light of the comments, predicting Bolt may experience a backlash from the home crowd when he comes out to compete in the 4x100m relay on Saturday night

Ms Robison added: 'The spectators, they are just having a 
ball, cheering everybody on. It's a great atmosphere. Glasgow is 
fantastic and the Games have been amazing on so many fronts - so 
well-organised and a great experience for everyone involved.'

Bolt later denied he made the comments, tweeting this morning: 'I'm waking up to this nonsense... journalist please don't create lies to make headlines.'

The denial was retweeted 1,600 times within two hours of posting it.

His manager, Ricky Simms, has also claimed the reports are 'utter rubbish', adding: 'The atmosphere in and around the stadiums has been absolutely fantastic.'

Bolt then brushed off questions about whether he made the comments as he watched Jamaica's netball team play New Zealand this afternoon.

The six-time Olympic champion arrived at the netball during the second quarter of the match.

He was quickly spotted by the fans in the crowd, who clamoured to take photographs of him on their mobile phones.

Bolt was handed a Jamaican flag, which he dutifully waved, clapping enthusiastically whenever his team scored.

Bolt refused to answer questions from the media about his alleged comments as he watched netball today

The sprinter had vowed to watch 'the Reggae girls' Jamaica netball team if he had time while in Glasgow

Bolt took to Twitter to deny he made the comments this morning, branding the reports 'nonsense'

During the match, he tweeted: 'Team Jamaica all day everyday day #Netball #JamvsNZL #Glasgow2014 #CWG2014', along with photographs of the game.

During half-time Bolt, who wore khaki trousers, a black hooded top and sunglasses, which were backwards and upside down on his head, signed autographs and posed for photographs with officials and athletes in the VIP area.

It seemed his alleged comments about the Games had not diminished his star status among the fans.

Jamaican Molly Rhone, president of the International Netball Federation, also gave Bolt a hug and stroked his head and face during half-time, seemingly grateful for the star appearance.

When journalists tried to approach Bolt for comment, his manager shouted for security, who escorted them from the VIP area.

It was muted this afternoon that Bolt may not compete in the Games at all because the Scottish weather is too cold.

Former champion sprinter Darren Campbell told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'We've watched the Jamaican athletes win medals and not do a lap of honour because it's so cold. I'm not saying he's not going to run but it wouldn't surprise me if he didn't.'

This
 is the first Commonwealth Games for Bolt, who said a hamstring injury 
prevented him from attending the Melbourne Games in 2006 and bad timing 
prevented him going to Delhi in 2010.

'I've always wanted to compete in a Commonwealth Games,' he said over the weekend.

Bolt, who 
won the men's 100m sprint at the London Olympics in 2012, is due to run 
in the 4x100m relay in Scotland's famous Hampden Park stadium starting 
on Saturday evening.

Bolt did not compete in the 100m sprint, because an injury earlier in the season prevented him from attending trials. The event was won by Jamaican Kemar Bailey-Cole with a time of 10 seconds flat.

If Bailey-Cole had run the same time at the final of the event at the 2012 Olympics he would have finished eighth.

A
 spokesman for the Commonwealth Games Federation initially said the
 Jamaican 100m champion 'must just be having an off day', but this morning said organisers were 'pleased' with Bolt's response.

Chief executive Mike Hooper told this morning's Games briefing: 'We take Mr Bolt at his word. We're very pleased with how he's responded and that's our position.'

Do you think Usain Bolt is right about the Commonwealth Games?

Bolt's first press conference in Britain went off the rails at the weekend, with reporters asking him his opinion on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the upcoming Scottish referendum.

The Jamaican six-time Olympic champion threw his hands in the air in confusion as he was inundated with questions.

Rumours of wider disquiet among Jamaican athletes grew this morning when fellow sprinter Jason Livermore appeared to suggest he was not enjoying the games.

Livermore was asked if he thought teammate Bolt was having a good time and replied: 'I hope so, better than me.'

Asked what he meant, Livermore back-tracked, saying: 'It's been lovely so far, the people in Scotland are very welcoming, I can't complain. Nice atmosphere, nice crowd, I'm enjoying myself.'

Asked how he was coping with the food in the village, Livermore said: 'Ooof, sometimes.' Pressed for more details, he said: 'I can say, I won't say.'

Bolt won gold for the 100m sprint at the London Olympics, but did not compete in the event at the Commonwealth Games because an injury stopped him from attending trials

Bolt's teammate Jason Livermore also appeared to suggest he wasn't enjoying himself in an interview today

Livermore 
looked to be feeling the cold ahead of his 200m heat on Wednesday 
morning and said: 'It's very cold here, I need to put on some clothes, 
I'm freezing.'

Bookies have now slashed the odds on Bolt pulling out of the games completely in protest at the row.

Ladbrokes
 now have him at 5/1 to withdraw, with the firm's Alex Donohue saying: 
'Bolt moved quickly to quash the rumours on Twitter but we think there's
 no smoke without fire and we can't rule out a late withdrawal.'

Another
 busy day is planned at the games today, with former Strictly Come 
Dancing contestant Louis Smith competing in the artistic gymnastics 
individual all-round final this afternoon.

Fans
 will then pack into Hampden Park tonight to watch a track and field 
line-up that includes Olympic long-jump champion Greg Rutherford.

Kenya's
 David Rudisha, who is the Olympic champion and world-record holder, 
will feature in the 800m semi-finals and Grenada's Olympic star Kirani 
James will compete in the 400m final.

England's
 women's hockey team recorded a 2-1 win over Scotland this morning in a 
tough match which will see them through to the semi-finals.
