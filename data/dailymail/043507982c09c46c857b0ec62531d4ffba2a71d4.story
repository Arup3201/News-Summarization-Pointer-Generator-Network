West Bromwich Albion have made contact with Tim Sherwood and Tony Pulis about the prospect of replacing sacked Alan Irvine.

The pair are the leading candidates to take over, with chairman Jeremy Peace eager to make a new appointment by the weekend.

It is believed initial discussions have taken place with each manager’s representatives with further talks to come.

There are hurdles to overcome with both men. Pulis, 56, would provide an experienced hand in West Brom’s battle against the drop – having performed a similar role remarkably with Crystal Palace last season – but would insist on control of transfers.

That would represent a significant departure for Peace from his current continental model, where technical director Terry Burton, only appointed last summer, identifies recruits.

Pulis, who is understood to have been contacted late on Monday night, is also likely want trusted assistants David Kemp and Gerry Francis to join the Hawthorns staff.

Sherwood came close to landing the job last summer before talks broke down over wages and his desire to bring in assistants Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey. 

However, an agreement could be reached this time round with stances potentially softening on both sides. Sherwood, 45, has been out of work for nearly eight months since leaving Tottenham and West Brom have yet to offer a public assurance to current assistant Keith Downing over his future.

Peace’s determination to remain in the Barclays Premier League is the overriding factor in this situation.
