Grimsby: 25 per cent of people living in the town are not in employment ot training

Young people face wildly different prospects depending on their home town, with up to one in four out of school, work or training in some UK cities.

A new report reveals the nation's Neet (not in education, employment or training) 'blackspots', and suggests youngsters living in the north are more likely to suffer from fewer opportunities.

Time spent as a Neet can damage youngsters' work skills, make them more likely to turn to crime, leave them facing lower wages in the future, and reduce life expectancy, according to a paper by the Work Foundation for the Private Equity Foundation.

Just under an estimated one million 16 to 24-year-olds (979,000 in total) are considered Neet, according to official figures published in August.

Of these, around 186,000 are aged 16-18.

But less is known about where these young people live, the study said.

Using existing figures on the labour market, it analysed Neet levels among 16 to 24-year-olds in 53 of the largest towns and cities in Great Britain.

The findings showed that cities and towns in the area from Liverpool across to Hull were more likely to have high or very high Neet levels.

Mapping the divide: The Work Foundation report illustrates how the country is split in terms of offering opportunities to young people

In comparison, those with low or very low Neet levels were more likely to be further south.

Grimsby, Doncaster, Warrington and Wigan were all found to have very high Neet levels of almost 25 per cent.

Others, such as Blackpool, and Rochdale and Oldham, were likely to have more than one in five youngsters that were Neet.

At
the other end of the scale, Oxford, Aberdeen, York, Plymouth and 
Cambridge all had very low Neet levels of less than 10 per cent.

Separate
figures for London, which were not broken down by borough, showed that 
the north east of London had very high Neet levels of more than 20per 
cent, while in east London, between 18 per cent to 20per cent of 
youngsters were Neet.

The south west of London was found to have the lowest levels in the capital with less than 14 per cent considered Neet.

The
report warned that a failure to address the problems facing young people would not just
damage individuals, but lead to growing costs for 'the government, our 
economy and society'.

Cities
with high Neet levels tended to have 'wider problems, with weak 
economies, low skills profiles and often dependent on the public sector 
for employment', the study said.

And the recession had widened the gap between cities with high Neet rates and those that were lower.

'The government urgently needs to consider the problems faced by young people in many of our towns and cities,' it said.

'Neets
in these cities face a double hit: reduced employment opportunities and
a weak economy and reduced services resulting from public sector cuts.'

Consequences: The report warned failure to address the problem of those unemployed and without educational opportunities would lead to growing problems for society

Shaks
Ghosh, chief executive of the Private Equity Foundation, said: 'This 
report has highlighted the great disparity in opportunities for young 
people across Great Britain.

'The
fact that nearly a quarter of 16 to 24-year-olds are disengaged from 
education or employment in certain cities is not only shocking but very 
sad.

'Children from deprived areas urgently need the right support to continue in school, go to college or to get a job.

'To neglect these Neets, risks a crisis in too many of our communities.'
