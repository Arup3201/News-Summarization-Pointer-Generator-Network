Thousands of cats rescued from the dinner table in Vietnam have been crushed to death beneath the wheels of a dumper truck in a grisly mass execution that has horrified animal lovers.

The cargo of around three tons of cats crammed into bamboo cages stacked one on top of another were seized in the capital Hanoi last Tuesday on their way to be sold to restaurants.

The terrified animals, many of them stolen pets, were smuggled from China to the Vietnamese capital where cat meat is called 'little tiger' and eaten as a delicacy. Some died in their cages in transit.

Now, in a shocking twist, Mail Online has learnt that all of the cats dead and alive have been crushed while still in their bamboo cages soon after their rescue because of fears they might spread disease.

Cruelty: Thousands of cats were crammed into bamboo cages as they were smuggled from China to  Vietnam

'Delicacy': Three tonnes of cats, many stolen pets, would have been sold to restaurants in Hanoi

The cats initially appeared to have had a lucky escape when a police officer in Hanoi's Dong Da district stopped the truck which had come to the capital from a town near the Chinese border in north-east Vietnam.

Pictures of the cats crammed into the pitifully small cages triggered a wave of offers from regional and international animal welfare groups to treat and find homes for the surviving cats.

Brigitte Bardot offered financial help for the cats via the US embassy but it now appears that all the surviving cats were killed inside their cages shortly after the interception of the truck.

Le Duc Chinh, who investigated the seizure of cats for animal welfare group the Asia Canine Protection Alliance (ACPA), said environmental officials told him all the cats had to be destroyed and buried in case they spread disease.

A waste treatment company was hired and used a dumper truck to crush the cats in their bamboo cages before burying them in a the Kieu Ky waste treatment area near the centre of Hanoi, watched by police, Mr Chinh said.

'The cats were buried and covered with lime because of concerns that they might spread disease in the capital,' he said. 'Many of the cats had died during the long trip from China.

'I was appalled and asked them why they did this to the surviving cats, but the officials insisted they were following the law which says they should destroy animals immediately if they do not have health check certificates.' 

He denied claims that some of the cats were buried alive, adding: 'I checked with waste company Binh Minh who buried the cats. They said they killed all the cats and then they buried them.'

Tragedy: After all the cats were killed, Le Duc Chinh from the Asia Canine Protection Alliance said: 'I was appalled and asked them [the authorities] why they did this to the surviving cats'

John Dalley, of Thailand-based Soi Dog Foundation which led attempts by the coalition to save the lives of the cats, said: 'This is a particularly distressing case, not least because a number of organisations including ourselves offered to help.

'We had vets on standby from Thursday throughout the weekend ready to fly from Thailand. The Vietnamese authorities quite simply refused to give any information, or respond to calls.

'The fact that police intercepted the cats which were bound for restaurants and slaughter houses is commendable, but what followed is not acceptable in any civilised country.'

Mr Dalley added: 'We can only hope that they did not die in vain, and the authorities will take steps to implement existing laws to end the inhumane trade in dogs, cats and wildlife that are not recognised as livestock in Vietnam.

'Appalling': The cats were crushed to death and buried by the Binh Minh waste company to stop them 'spreading disease'

Illegal: Local activist hopes Vietnam will follow Thailand's lead and ban the killing of animals which are not livestock

'The vast majority of these animals are stolen pets or illegally imported from other countries as with these cats. The dangers of spreading diseases such as rabies and cholera cannot be overstressed, even if one accepts the cruelty involved in the trade.

'The government of Thailand has recently introduced laws banning the killing of animals for food that are not considered livestock and we hope other nations in Asia will follow their example.'

Cat meat is an illegal dish in Vietnam but restaurants serving it have boomed in popularity in Hanoi recently in part because of a crackdown on the dog meat trade.

They are particularly popular at festival times and last week's seizure came ahead of the Tet, or New Year, festival in Vietnam later this month - the country's biggest annual national holiday.

The lorry driver arrested over the illicit delivery of cats told police the cats originally came from China and were loaded on his vehicle in Vietnam's north eastern Quang Ninh province after being traded.
