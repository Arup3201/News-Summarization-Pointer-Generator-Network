Fashion designer Jodhi Meares may be in hiding after her drunken car crash on Saturday night but her sportswear business certainly hasn't slowed down.

The 43-year-old's clothes label, The Upside, began a 50 per cent sale on the day of the crash that saw Jodhi smash into three parked cars while driving her bronze Range Rover in Bondi, eastern Sydney.

The firesale on her range of hardcore exercise garments - inspired by Jodhi's own love of working out - was promoted heavily on Twitter on Wednesday.

The Noiseworks lead singer, who proposed to the former Mrs Packer in 2013, has been seen nipping out to buy groceries for the former swimwear model as she avoids attention inside her luxury $2 million pad.

The huge collision at 9.30pm on Saturday left the beautiful brunette trapped in her car until onlookers and police came to her rescue.

Jodhi's current situation sees her facing potential jail time over the smash.

Police arrived at Jodhi's home on Wednesday. They spent about 20 minutes at the luxury address in Sydney's east

On Wednesday afternoon, two female police officers turned up at Jodhi's home.

They spent about 20 minutes inside the property talking to the model.

They previously visited her home at about 5.20pm on Monday. Rose Bay police arrived to make 'further enquiries' regarding Saturday night's crash.

She has been charged with high-range drink driving and driving with a suspended licence after crashing her Range Rover into three cars and rolling it.

Jodhi was allegedly driving without a valid license and with nearly four times the legal blood alcohol limit.

Police said a roadside breath test returned a reading of 0.181.

She will face Waverley Local Court on August 5.

The maximum penalty for high-range drink driving is a $3,300 fine and an 18-month jail sentence.

An aide for Jon Stevens, Ms Meare's fiance, told Channel Nine on Monday: 'She made a mistake, she made an error of judgment. There's no more comment.'

Style Runner marketing director Kelly Barriball, who manages The Upside brand amongst other fashion clients would not be drawn when asked whether she believed recent events may impact on Jodhi's brand's image or sales. She said: 'We don't have anything to say on this matter at this stage.'

Jodhi's reinvention of herself after her modelling career saw her first create her swimwear label Tigerlily in 2001, during her marriage to billionaire James Packer.

The range of skimpy swimmers were a success but by 2007 she was ready to move on, selling the label to surfwear giant Billabong for an amount reported to be between $3 and $5 million, staying on as a consultant before eventually cutting ties.

The Upside has enjoyed success since its launch in 2013, including signing Victoria's Secret Angel Candice Swanepoel as the face.
