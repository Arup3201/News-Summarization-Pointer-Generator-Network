A Montreal man who believed for months that he was going to be the father of quintuplets has spoken out about the moment he discovered his girlfriend's entire pregnancy was a lie.

Paul Servat, 35, had his dream dashed by doctors in hospital on Wednesday after his girlfriend, Barbara Bienvenue, 37, had been admitted to give birth.

A nurse produced a file of Bienvenue's blood work to show Servat that not only wasn't it his girlfriend's delivery day, she was never actually carrying children, according to The Toronto Sun.

Bienvenue is now undergoing a psychological evaluation and is believed to be suffering from pseudocyesis, or a phantom pregnancy, in which sufferers can exhibit all of the symptoms of a pregnancy but with no baby.

A friend of Servat's has alleged Bienvenue pulled the same stunt with another man in 2010.

Torn apart: Paul Servat said the concept of becoming a father to five children had consumed his entire life, only to be told his girlfriend, Barbara Bienvenue, was never actually pregnant. His is pictured here in what was meant to be the nursery, inside his home in Montreal

Just a few weeks earlier, Savat was all-smiles as he and girlfriend Barbara Bienvenue planned for the arrival of their children, even setting up a Facebook to document the experience

'She let me choose the names,' Servat told QMI Agency from the baby room in his home, which was filled with five adorned cribs.

'I lost everything, it was my whole life.'

Servat said Bienvenue's baby story lasted 34 weeks, after she had surprised her new beau in September with news that she was expecting.

They had only been dating for two months at the time.

'We were so happy,' Servat said.

'Even my parents, they were so looking forward to having grandchildren.'

As weeks passed Bienvenue told Servat she was expecting twins, then triplets, then quadruplets and finally the stunning news that there were five babies in her belly.

A Facebook page was made to document the pregnancy and, eventually, display the gifts that the couple received from their neighbors and local businesses.

'I used my personal and professional contacts to get her sponsorships. Others gave her all sorts of clothes or furniture,' a friend of 35-year-old Barbara told The Toronto Sun.

The first person to become suspicious of the situation was Genevieve Laflamme who recently gave birth to triplets. 

'I gave her tips on how to handle it, where to get financial support, where to get sponsors for diapers,' Ms Laflamme told CTV.

Barbara Bienvenue is now undergoing a physic evaluation. A friend of her boyfriend has alleged she has faked a pregnancy before with another man

She reportedly started to question Barbara's version of events when she found unspecified holes in her story.

One of the clearest examples that something was awry came just a week before Barbara's alleged due date when she told Ms Laflamme that a new ultrasound showed that she was having quintuplets.

The fact that she was up and moving so close to her alleged due date should have also come as a sign of trouble.

A full term single pregnancy is 37 weeks, but women carrying multiple children regularly go into labor or doctor-mandated bed rest months before that. 

Then on Wednesday, the supposed scheduled delivery date, Servat found out the truth.

'The doctors told me it was a phantom pregnancy,' he said.

Back to the original owners: Paul has kept the Facebook group active in order to try to return the gifts he and his now-ex girlfriend received for the 'babies'

What remains: Paul only learned that his girlfriend was never pregnant when he went to the hospital for what he believed was going to be the birth of his four- or five- children

Bienvenue is now under psychiatric observation.

Servat said she was so convinced she was pregnant that her belly swelled, she began lactating and even had morning sickness.

Servat said he plans to give back all the presents they had received or donate them.

'I'll return all these things to people who sent them or give them (away),' Servat said.

'I'm a good person and I have nothing to do with these lies.'
