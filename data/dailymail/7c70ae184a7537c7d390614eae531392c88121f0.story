Richard Overton, the oldest living United States veteran at 108 years old, credits his longevity to two things.

First there's his 'medicine' - the tablespoon of whiskey he adds to his morning coffee, which he claims keeps his muscles tender.

Then there's the dozen or so cigars he smokes - but doesn't inhale - everyday.

Overton was at the center of last year's Veterans Day parade in Arlington - accepting a celebratory box of beloved cigars during a standing ovation - and appeared again this year at the parade near his home in Austin, Texas.

Overton, was born in Bastrop County, served in the Army during World War II.

He served in the South Pacific from 1942 to 45. 

He sold furniture in Austin after the war and later worked for the state Treasurer's Office.

He still drives and walks without a cane.

During a television interview last March, he told a reporter that he doesn't take medicine other than aspirin.

And of course his morning whiskey.

The key to living to his age, he said, is simply 'staying out of trouble'.

More than 100 people packed a conference room at the Stephen F. Austin building in downtown Austin last November for a ceremony honoring Overton and Ken Wallingford, who spent 10 months in a tiger cage as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. 

The event was overseen by the General Land Office and the Veterans Land Board.

'I've gotten so many letters and so many thank-yous and I enjoy every bit of it, but I'm still going to enjoy some more,' said Overton.

Though widowed 22 years ago he still lives in the house he built in Texas after the end of the war.

Overton was in his 30s when he volunteered in 1942 and saw action in the Pacific with the Army's 188th Aviation Engineer Battalion.

Obama elaborated on Overton's proud record to the crowd last year. 

'He was there at Pearl Harbor when the battleships were still smoldering,' Obama said.

'He was there at Okinawa. He was there at Iwo Jima.'

The president added that Overton still rakes his own lawn and drives ladies in his neighborhood to church every Sunday in his old Ford pickup. 

Overton also believes in staying active as much as possible. 

He said that if there's leaves to rake or a driveway to clean, he's going to go out and do it.

But while he is a proud returned serviceman, Overton said we should be careful about being proud of war. 

'War's nothing to be into,' he told USA Today last year. 

'You don't want to go into the war if you don't have to. But I had to go.

'I enjoyed it after I'd went and come back, but I didn't enjoy it when was over there. 

'I had to do things I didn't want to do.'
