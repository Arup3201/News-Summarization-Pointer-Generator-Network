Criminals are being locked up for longer as the government keeps its promise to be tough on those who break the law, new figures show.

Convictions of celebrity sex abusers are believed to be partly responsible for a larger number of sex offenders being prosecuted, as victims feel more confident about coming forward to expose their abusers.

The average jail term now stands at 15 1/2 months, three months longer than the average in 2004, and prisoners are getting longer sentences now than they have done for 20 years, Ministry Of Justice MOJ) figures reveal.

A source close to Justice Minister Chris Grayling told MailOnline: 'Criminals who break the law and ruin the lives of decent hardworking people have to realise they will go to prison.

'A slap on the wrist isn't acceptable for those who make others' lives a misery.' 

The average custodial sentence length (ACSL), or length of time people are sentenced to, has increased year on year over the last decade, according to the MOJ's new criminal justice statistics update.

The new figures, which don't include life or indeterminate sentences, show that while fines are the most commonly given punishment by all courts, offenders who are sent to jail are facing a longer period inside, particularly sex offenders.

Criminals jailed for sex offences are jailed for longer than any others, with an average sentence of 58.7 months.  The custody rate for these offenders is also up, with 60 per cent of those convicted of sex offenders being sent to prison, second only to robbers, of whom 64 per cent are jailed.

This is thought to be due in part to an increase in the number of celebrity sex offenders being convicted for abuse giving victims confidence to come forward.

In the last year alone, celebrity publicist Max Clifford, broadcaster Stuart Hall and former children's television presenter Rolf Harris have all been jailed for sex offences.

In July, Rolf Harris was jailed for five years and nine months after being found guilty of 12 indecent assaults against four girls.

The 84-year-old artist and children's presenter was jailed by Mr Justice Sweeney, who told him he had taken advantage of his celebrity and had shown 'no remorse'.

Former It's A Knockout presenter Stuart Hall was sentenced to 30 months in jail after he admitted indecently assaulting 13 girls aged between nine and 17 over a period of 20 years.

Earlier this year, the 84-year-old was jailed for a further 30 months after admitting indecently assaulting an under-age girl.

But the judge told him he would have received a 'considerably greater' sentence had he been prosecuted under current laws.

Under his first sentence, Hall would have been due for early release this month at the earliest, but now he will not be eligible for parole until December 2015.

Celebrity publicist Max Clifford, 71, was jailed for eight years in May after a jury found him guilty of eight counts of indecent assault against teenage girls and young women between 1966 and 1984.

The sentence imposed by Judge Anthony Leonard was far longer than expected, partly, the judge said, because of his 'quite extraordinary' attitude during the trial, in which he was seen laughing and shaking his head as evidence was given.

Clifford was told that had some of offences been tried under today's law, they would have been considered as rape or assault by penetration with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.

The tide of celebrity sex abuse cases is thanks to Operation Yewtree, a national police investigation into decades-old sex crimes perpetrated by television icons such as the late Jimmy Savile and Gary Glitter. 

The government has introduced automatic life sentences for anyone who commits a second violent or sexual offence, ensuring the most serious criminals are dealt with severely.

The justice minister has said he wants criminals to know that a serious offence will earn them a jail sentence rather than a caution.

Mr Grayling is currently pushing a bill through parliament to ensure that criminals will no longer receive cautions for serious offences, and for less serious offences they will no longer receive a second caution for the same or similar offence committed in a two-year period.
