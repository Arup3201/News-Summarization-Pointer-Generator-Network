Manuel Neuer enjoyed his first training session since being named on the final three-man Ballon d'Or shortlist as Bayern Munich's players were put through their paces on Tuesday.

The Germany international will fight it out with Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi for the prestigious award next month but it was business as usual for Pep Guardiola's men as they trained ahead of Saturday's game with Bayer Leverkusen.

Roger Schmidt's side are third in the Bundesliga and a win at the Allianz Arena would take them to within seven points of league leaders Bayern.

Neuer looked keen to ensure his side continue their unbeaten start to the season as he threw himself around during a high intensity session in Munich.

Speaking about making the final three for Ballon d'or, Neuer told fcbayern.de: 'That's wonderful news and a huge honour for me. There's no guarantee a goalkeeper will ever be nominated.

'But to a very large extent, the credit has to go to my teams. We had a magnificent 2014 with FC Bayern and Germany and won trophies.'

Guardiola was typically animated as he led his players in training, three days after their narrow 1-0 win away at Hertha Berlin.

Midfielders Bastian Schweinsteiger and Xabi Alonso were both pictured in action, while flying wingers Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben enjoyed a good-natured tussle for the ball during one drill.

After Saturday's game with Leverkusen, Bayern complete their Champions League group with a home game against CSKA Moscow on December 10.
