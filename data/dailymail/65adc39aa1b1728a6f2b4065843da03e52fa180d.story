The mysterious strands of dark matter that hide beneath the visible universe may have been seen for the first time.

Dark matter is considered crucial to theories explaining how the universe is expanding and how galaxies interact, but has so far eluded scientists.

Now, astronomers have produced the first direct images of a part of its network using a quasar as a ‘flashlight’.

Computer simulations suggest that matter in the universe is distributed in a 'cosmic web' of filaments, as seen in the image above from a large-scale dark-matter simulation. The inset is a zoomed-in, high-resolution image of a smaller part of the cosmic web, 10 million light-years across

A quasar is a type of active galactic nucleus that emits intense radiation powered by a supermassive black hole at the centre of the galaxy.

This particular quasar, located 10 billion light-years away, illuminated a vast nebula of diffuse gas to reveal the network of filaments that connect galaxies in a cosmic web.

For years, cosmologists have been running computer simulations of the structure of the universe to develop what they refer to as the ‘standard model of cosmology’.

Their calculations suggest that as the universe grows, matter becomes clustered like a huge cosmic web, weaving its way into in filaments and nodes under the force of gravity.

This deep image shows the nebula (cyan) extending across 2 million light-years that was discovered around the bright quasar UM287 (at the center of the image). The energetic radiation of the quasar makes the surrounding intergalactic gas glow, revealing the morphology and physical properties of a cosmic web filament

Dark matter surrounds galaxies across the universe, and is invisible because it does not reflect light.

It
 cannot be seen directly with telescopes, but astronomers know it to be 
out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we 
can see.

Galaxies,
 for example, could not rotate the way they do and hold their shape 
without the presence of dark matter, researchers say.

The European Space Agency said: 'Shine a torch in a completely dark room, and you will see only what the torch illuminates.

'That does not mean that the room around you does not exist.

'Similarly we know dark matter exists but have never observed it directly.'

Scientists are fairly sure it exists and 
is crucial to the universe, but they do not know what it looks like or 
where to find it.

The latest results from the 10-metre Keck telescope in Hawaii, are reported by scientists from the University of California, Santa Cruz and the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg.

‘This is a very exceptional object: it's huge, at least twice as large as any nebula detected before, and it extends well beyond the galactic environment of the quasar,’ said first author Sebastiano Cantalupo, a postdoctoral fellow at UC Santa Cruz.  

The distance to the quasar is so great that the emitted light is ‘stretched’ by the expansion of the universe from an invisible ultraviolet wavelength to a visible shade of violet by the time it reaches the Keck Telescope.

‘We have studied other quasars this way without detecting such extended gas,’ Professor Cantalupo said.

‘The light from the quasar is like a flashlight beam, and in this case we were lucky that the flashlight is pointing toward the nebula and making the gas glow.’

In an earlier survey of distant quasars using the same technique to look for glowing gas, researchers detected so-called ‘dark galaxies,’ the densest knots of gas in the cosmic web.

These dark galaxies are thought to be either too small or too young to have formed stars.

‘The dark galaxies are much denser and smaller parts of the cosmic web,’ said Professor Cantalupo.

‘In this new image, we also see dark galaxies, in addition to the much more diffuse and extended nebula.

‘Some of this gas will fall into galaxies, but most of it will remain diffuse and never form stars.’

While the observations support the computer simulations' picture of a cosmic web, the researchers' results suggest there is around 10 times more gas in the nebula than predicted.

They believe the discrepancy may be due to limitations in the spatial resolution of the current models.

It could be because the current grid-based models are missing some aspect of the underlying physics of how galaxies form and interact with quasars, they suggest.

‘These observations are challenging our understanding of intergalactic gas and giving us a new laboratory to test and refine our models,’ Professor Cantalupo said.
