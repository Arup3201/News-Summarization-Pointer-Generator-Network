At the height of his 70s fame she was yet to arrive in the world.

And her R'n'B songs are a world away from his glam rock tracks.

Yet Beyonce appears to have sought inspiration from Slade's Dave Hill as she unveiled her kooky new fringe and straight locks.

The star usually opts for long, glossy and with a wave but has switched for a style that resembles a helmet.

Hill, now 68, was known for his penchant for wearing jumpsuits that appeared to be made out of the foil used to baste turkeys but it was his distinctive hair that made headlines and once led a music journalist to describe it as a 'sort of demented tonsure with a great scooping fringe.'

Beyonce was enjoying a holiday in Paris and revealed her dramatic change as she arrived at Gare du Nord station with rapper husband Jay Z, 44, and two-year-old daughter Blue Ivy to take the Eurostar to London's St Pancras station.

It is not the first time Beyonce has courted attention for transforming her hair.

In August last year she opted for a bleached, pixie crop that also set tongues wagging.

Beyonce and Jay-Z spent yesterday in east London visiting a community arts project and sculpture galleries.

Earlier this year it was reported the couple have bought themselves a sprawling £5.5million London townhouse.

After looking both in Mayfair and out in the sticks – the Cotswolds – the pair are believed to have chosen a detached property in West London.

A source is reported to have said: 'Both Jay and Beyonce are Anglophiles and have been toying with the idea of getting a pad for a couple of years now. 

Making it work! The defiant singer has taken to her Tumblr account to show off her new 'do 

'On previous trips, they have stayed in five star hotels and, on one occasion, a rented mansion. While money isn't an issue, it makes sense for them to have a more permanent base and get to know one particular area.

'They are coming to England this year and touring before the year is out.'

As well as a host of trendy restaurants and Portobello market, their new home is near a number of top primary schools – should the couple want to make the move more permanent and school Blue Ivy in England.

The couple spent yesterday visiting a community arts project and sculpture galleries in London, where they are believed to have bought a £5.5million townhouse earlier this year.
