After our glorious, golden summer, the long days and warm nights are giving way to autumn. The mornings are crisper, the evenings cool.

But the melancholy of the fading year is mixed with excitement, for late summer is the most beautiful — and generous — of all seasons.

A mild, wet winter and hot summer have made for a bountiful August. There are bumper crops of blackberries, currants, pears and apples across the countryside.

Sloe berries are not usually ready for picking until later in the year, but the fine summer and ample rainfall of the past few weeks has encouraged the berries to ripen early. They are often used in gin, jelly and puddings

In my home patch of the Ashford valley in East Kent, partridge and pigeon feast on fallen grains in the fields. On the shady edges of the fields where horses and cattle graze, mushrooms gleam like fat pearls.

Hedges are swagged with blackberries, and poisonous woody nightshade winds around the hazel bushes where the nuts are starting to drop from their husks.

But most spectacular of all the wild harvest this summer are the black marbles of the sloe. They are not usually ready for picking until later in the year, but the fine summer and ample rainfall of the past few weeks has encouraged the berries to ripen early.

Sloes are a capricious fruit. Some years the yield is so sparse as to be scarcely worth picking. Even in a good season I wouldn’t expect to gather them until September. But last weekend the hedges were already heavy with cloudy, deep-blue berries.

The smaller, sourer sisters of damson plums, sloes are the most feral of hedgerow fruit. They are mouth-puckeringly bitter. Foraging cooks suggest apple-and-sloe jelly, steamed sloe pudding, or even preserving them in brine like the Japanese do with plums.

But really the best way to treat a sloe is to pierce it with a needle and drown it in gin.

After weeks of steeping in the cellar, the black sloe will give you a dark, autumnal cordial with an almondy, faintly medicinal essence. There is nothing better for keeping out the midwinter chill.

The Latin name for the sloe is Prunus spinosa, or spiny plum. Anyone who has had their hands and arms shredded while trying to gather sloes will know that it is spikily apt.

The thorny black branches give the sloe its alternative name of blackthorn. Its trees are beautiful in March when their starry white flowers are among nature’s earliest harbingers of spring.

While the sloe’s more palatable cousin, the cherry plum, was probably brought to Britain by the Romans, and gradually hybridised to produce Prunus domestica, the sweet European plum, the sloe has remained stubbornly undomesticated. It is still valued by some farmers as an ideal animal-proof hedge.

Our frugal ancestors could find uses for most kinds of wild harvest, but Mrs Beeton’s compendious 19th-century Book of Household Management has nothing to say about sloes. By 1932, however, Florence White, founder of the English Folk Cookery Association, had included a recipe for ‘Aunt Lucy’s Home-made Sloe Wine’ in her cookbook, Good Things In England.

I’m not sure that I’d like the wine — an acid-sounding fermented confection of sloes, lemon, sugar and water. But the sloe gin in The Constance Spry Cookery Book (1958) is another matter.

The dark sloe berries are often used in certain types of gin and in sloe gin sling cocktails (pictured)

Mrs Spry was a society florist who did the flowers for the wedding of the Duke of Windsor and Wallis Simpson and ran a select cordon bleu cookery and flower-arranging school. If a recipe appeared in her compendious tome it was a sure sign of social acceptance.

Spry’s recipe for sloe gin isn’t complicated: the only variation to the basic method of combining one-and-a-half pints of pricked sloes with ¾lb sugar-candy and a quart of gin is the addition of a few bitter almonds.

Tantalisingly, she suggests that ‘the sloes may afterwards be used for flavouring purposes’, but doesn’t say how.

Here the indefatigable Clarissa Dixon Wright (of Two Fat Ladies fame) comes to the rescue. Clarissa, who died earlier this year, assumed that you’d always have a few gin-soaked sloes handy.

In her excellent Game Cookbook (2004) she wrote: ‘In all my years of drinking I sadly threw away the sloes from yet another finished bottle of sloe gin.’

Having sobered up, she discovered you can use the gin-soaked berries to flavour a casserole of wild duck and vegetables. I’ve tried her method with domestic duck and it is very good. It is hard not to love a recipe that ends with the advice to ‘add more gin if the sauce is too thick’. In Devon, they add the ginny sloes to cider, making a beverage aptly known as ‘slider’. And some people dip the sloes in chocolate to make little alcoholic sweeties.

I first made sloe gin ten years ago. My son still recalls the shaming occasion when the chap behind us in the supermarket queue peered into my trolley, which had four litres of Sainsbury’s own-brand gin, a lemon and a packet of cat food, and remarked: ‘Planning a big weekend, are we?’

I usually follow the Constance Spry recipe, substituting preserving sugar (without extra pectin) for loaf sugar, and instead of bitter almonds I use strips of lemon peel, a few cloves, a stick of cinnamon and some star anise.

Now, traditionally, you shouldn’t gather the sloes before the first frost, but if you can’t resist picking them now, a short spell in the freezer seems to work just as well.

The real secret of good sloe gin is to keep the stuff for as long as you can. I keep each batch in a dark cupboard for a year, shaking the jar whenever I remember, before I drink it.

The resulting brew has an aromatic sweetness nothing like the sticky purple substance commercially marketed as sloe gin.

Some like to use it in cocktails, with such confections as the Moll Flanders (gin, sloe gin, dry vermouth, Angostura bitters), the Sloe Comfortable Screw (sloe gin, Southern Comfort, vodka, orange juice) and the dire- sounding Hopeless Case (sloe gin, peppermint schnapps, cola).

But I think it is best drunk neat, out of doors and near its roots, perhaps in the lee of a muddy Land Rover while sheltering from the howling wind and driving sleet of a freezing point-to-point meet.

Or later in the season when the pale sunshine hints at the coming of spring, and the white flowers of the blackthorn herald the next crop of bitter fruit.
