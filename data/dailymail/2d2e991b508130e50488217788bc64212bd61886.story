Two
American service members have been shot and killed by a man in an Afghan police uniform, the U.S. military confirmed Thursday.

The killings are the latest in a rash of  ‘green-on-blue’ attacks, in which Afghan security
forces turn their weapons on US-led foreign troopers.

Before Thursday’s assault, 53 international troops had been
killed in insider attacks from Afghan soldiers or police so far this year,
according to the NATO military coalition.

It was not immediately clear if the attacker was an Afghan
police officer or an insurgent who had donned the disguise to get close to the
American troops, said Major Lori Hodge, a spokeswoman for U.S. forces in
Afghanistan.

The assailant killed the service members in the southern
Uruzgan province in the late morning, she added. A statement from the U.S.
force in Afghanistan says the attack is being investigated.

Provincial government spokesman Abdullah Himmat said the
assault happened near an Afghan police compound in Khas Uruzgan district.

Earlier in the day, an Australian soldier was also killed in an insider attack by Afghan forces in the same province.

These are the first such attacks on NATO
forces since September, and the first since the Afghan government 
launched a large-scale push to re-screen thousands of security forces, 
trying to identify infiltrators or those who might not be considered 
secure.

The Taliban have said they are using the attacks as a
specific strategy to drive a wedge between the international coalition and the
Afghans.

On Wednesday, the leader of the Afghan Taliban, Mullah
Mohammad Omar, released a statement saying insurgents would increase 
the number of insider attacks against coalition and Afghan forces.

In an emailed statement congratulating Muslims as they prepare to 
celebrate the Eid al-Adha holiday, Mullah Mohammad Omar urged 'every 
brave Afghan in the ranks of the foreign forces and their Afghan 
hirelings ... to strike them.'

'Jihadist activities inside the circle of the state militias are the 
most effective stratagem. Its dimension will see further expansion, 
organization and efficiency,' he said.

'Increase your efforts to expand 
the area of infiltration in the ranks of the enemy.

The killings have stretched to the breaking point a
partnership that U.S. and NATO officials consider a key part their exit plan -
preparing the Afghans to take over responsibility for their country’s security
in just over two years’ time.

The program, where Afghans and international troops
are supposed to work 'shoulder to shoulder,' is now being re-evaluated.

The majority of international combat troops are scheduled to
leave Afghanistan by the end of 2014, although trainers and advisers are expected to
remain longer.
