If Lee Cattermole gets through this weekend’s trip to Burnley without seeing red, it will mark 30 matches since his last dismissal.

Now that is hardly a cause for celebration for the majority of players, but when you consider the Sunderland midfielder was previously averaging a sending-off every 26.5 Premier League games, his satisfaction at such a run is perhaps justified.

At 26, England hopeful Cattermole believes he has settled down, on and off the pitch. One influence is Black Cats manager Gus Poyet, himself a hothead prone to red cards during his playing days. The other is a girlfriend as well as the passage of time.

‘You just grow up a bit don't you?’ said the player once nicknamed “Lee Clattermole” and who was cautioned by police after damaging five vehicles during a night out in Newcastle in 2012.

‘What is important is that you go through ups and downs and eventually you work out what helps you bring about a consistent level of performance. That's what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to find that consistent level for 30 to 35 games.

‘I don't want to be the best player one week and the worst the next. I'm trying to be a good solid performer every week. I feel I'm at that level now.

‘I think that is all down to being a bit older. I am 26 now, no longer a 20-year-old. I've been around a long time now as I was in the first team at Middlesbrough at 17. I just think sometimes you are just not old enough to be in the position you are in. It takes time to figure out things yourself.

‘The experiences I had as a 17-year-old will stand me in good stead and now I feel I'm coming to a good time in my career because of what happened in the past. I wouldn't change things.

‘I have got a girlfriend now and I have settled down a bit, but I have always prepared right for games. I have always taken my football very seriously, but when I was younger I wasn't as calm on the pitch as I could have been.

‘Things also happened off the pitch which got blown out of proportion. I am more focussed now and feel I am at a good time in my career.’

The faith of Poyet has also been a key factor. Cattermole was dropped after a horror show at Hull last season but returned to help the club escape relegation.

And he went on: ‘I played at Hull last season and had the best half of football in my career in the first and ended up giving away two goals in the second then didn't play for 10 games.

‘I was really disappointed because I thought I was playing brilliantly at the time and had played in the Capital One Cup final the week before. I then found myself out the team despite thinking I had been our best player for the previous couple of weeks.

‘But these are problems you are going to face as a footballer and you have got to come back in the right way. Now, I think he (Poyet) has given me a role in the team.

‘It is a big role which you have seen in Gus Poyet sides in the past. It is that defensive midfielder position.

‘I've listened to everything he has spoken about in training. There has been ups and downs but lately it has been going a lot more in the right direction.’
