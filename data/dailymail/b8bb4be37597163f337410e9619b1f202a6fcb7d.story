Detective Constable Gary Quigley, 46, is accused of spiking a bottle of energy drink with screenwash and leaving it in a communal fridge at work

A child protection detective tried to
poison his colleague by switching his Powerade drink with screenwash after 
becoming ‘fed up’ when his drink kept getting stolen, a court 
heard today.

DC Gary Quigley, 46, filled the 500ml
bottle of sports drink with the potentially deadly blue liquid in a bid
to catch the thief and ‘teach him a lesson’, jurors heard.

Detective Constable Steve Halfhide
experienced a ‘burning sensation’ in his mouth and throat and repeatedly
vomited after swallowing the noxious substance, Southwark Crown Court 
heard.

Describing the moment he drank the screenwash, DC Halfhide said:

'I swallowed two mouthfuls.I instantly felt burning in my throat and then I was physically sick into the sink.'

'I then went into one of the toilets and I was sick.I still had the burning in my throat.

'I obviously wasn't aware at the time of what it was I had. I was quite anxious and a little bit panicky.'

He drank milk and brushed his teeth to get rid of the taste and counteract the effects before pouring the rest of the liquid down the sink.

'I then decanted most of the bottle down the sink,' he added. 'It didn't look any different (to Powerade). It smelled to me like undiluted screenwash that was quite concentrated.'

DC Halfhide insisted he was unaware of any food or drink going missing or any issues between him and other staff. 'It was a good office', he told the jury.

Quigley later told an officer 
investigating the incident that it was his bottle and that he had 
emptied one of his energy drinks and replaced it with screenwash.

He told how he was ‘fed up’ with his bottles of drink being stolen and that he had ‘caught the thief’, jurors heard.

The detective said he was ‘dismayed’ when two drinks were earlier stolen from a communal fridge and insisted his ‘sole intention 
was to catch the thief', rather than to cause him or her any harm.

He claimed he forgot the bottle was in the fridge as he had been busy at work, jurors heard.

In interview, Quigley said in a prepared statement: ‘I admit fully and accept all culpability for my actions.

Quigley is said to have tipped screenwash into a Powerade bottle later drunk by Det Con Steve Halfhide, right

‘I am extremely sorry and deeply remorseful for what has happened. It was never my intention to cause any injury to anyone.'

Mr Halfhide was advised to go to 
hospital after drinking the screenwash on 29 January last year but escaped serious injury, jurors heard.

The pair were based at police offices
in Stratford, east London, but did not know each other, said 
prosecutor Jocelyn Ledward.

She said: ‘The allegation in this case is the 
defendant replaced the blue Powerade drink in a sports-style drinking 
bottle with screenwash and put it back in the communal fridge in the 
office he worked.

‘He says his motive in doing so was 
the belief the drink was his, and that the person who had been stealing 
his drinks would be taught a lesson.

‘In fact, his colleague Steve 
Halfhide had the misfortune also to be a drinker of Powerade, and to 
have stored his own Powerade drinks in the fridge.

‘When he drank from the Powerade in 
question, he swallowed a mouthful or two of screenwash before 
experienced the very unpleasant consequences.’

As Mr Halfhide poured the liquid away into the sink, he smelt it and recognised it as screenwash.

Ms Ledward added: 'Subsequent analysis
of the blue liquid that was left in the Powerade bottle from which Mr 
Halfhide drank shows that it contains a number of volatile substances, 
also detected in a control sample of screenwash from the (Child Abuse 
Investigation) office, including ethanol and various types of industrial
solvents.

'Although no analysis could be 
carried out for it, most screen washes contain ethylene glycol, also 
commonly found in antifreeze.

'Ethylene glycol is toxic if ingested in sufficient quantities.'

Ms Ledward added: ‘The prosecution 
say that whether this drink was in fact DC Halfhide’s, or whether he 
thought it was, or even if he was stealing DC Quigley’s drink is 
irrelevant.

‘This was a dangerous and completely disproportionate thing to do in the circumstances.

  'The defendant clearly intended that someone should drink from it or at least must have foreseen that someone might - that was precisely his purpose'

  - Prosecutor Jocelyn Ledward

‘By deliberately disguising the blue 
screen wash in a Powerade bottle and placing it, unlabelled, in the 
communal fridge, the defendant clearly intended that someone should 
drink from it or at least must have foreseen that someone might -that was
precisely his purpose.'

She added: ‘At the very least, he must have intended that the person should be annoyed by suffering an unpleasant experience.

‘Even if he honestly believed that 
anyone who took his drink was stealing it, to replace that drink with at
best an unpleasant substance, at worst, one that had the potential to 
be dangerous, was not a reasonable thing to do in the circumstances.’

While Quigley was awaiting trial, he 
contacted the drinks manufacturer, Coca Cola Enterprises, to check where the bottle could be traced to, the prosecutor added.

Quigley, from Colchester, Essex, denies a single count of administering a poison or noxious substance with intent.

The trial, which is expected to last three to four days, continues.
