The upcoming Google tablet will be a seven-inch wi-fi machine that could cost as little as £125.

The tablet was originally meant to appear in May, but the search giant has insisted that supplier Asus trim the price from its current $250 (£157) to $199 (£125.)

The tablet will have a quad-core processor, a seven-inch screen, and will be wi-fi only, according to reports in The Verge.

Google is to launch an online store for Android tablets this year to bolster flagging sales of the touchscreen machines

The tablet will be manufactured by Asus, but branded as a Google machine.

Google already offers similar Google-branded smartphones, made in collaboration with Samsung. 

The highly aggressive pricing will seriously undercut Apple's prices for its iPad - but will also put it in competition with Amazon's entertainment-oriented Kindle Fire.

Google recently rebranded its Android
Marketplace as Google Play, streamlining services such as its video 
store, ebook store and app marketplace, so the timing would make sense.

Google is also to manufacture its own tablets, due to its pending purchase of Motorola, which is awaiting approval in China.

Leaks
from hi-tech suppliers in the Far East had already hinted that a small,
cheap Android 'entertainment tablet' might be released in the first 
half of this year.

The tablet could sell for as little as £130, and will have a seven-inch screen, according to a leak reported in Digitimes.

Asus's hit EEEPad - the tablet maker is said to be developing a seven-inch tablet in collaboration with Google which would carry both Asus and Google branding

The
device would be a competitor to Amazon's Kindle Fire - and like Fire, 
would be built to sell content such as video and music via Google's own 
online store.

In
an interview with Italian newspaper Corriere della Serra, Google 
executive chairman Eric Schmidt reportedly said last year, 'In the next six 
months, we plan to market a tablet of the highest quality.'
