Tragic: Courtney Gwynn, who wanted to become an actress, was an 'anxious' but bright girl who was terrified she would get poor grades

A tormented 14-year-old schoolgirl, who 'hated being a teenager' killed herself because she was scared of failing at school, an inquest heard today.

Tragic Courtney Gwynn, who wanted to become an actress, was an 'anxious' but 'very bright' girl who was terrified she would get poor grades.

The teen, of Carharrack, near Redruth, Cornwall, had become so concerned that, in the days before her death, she had Googled the phrase 'failing at school'.

Police also found evidence that she had later also searched the internet for way of ending her life.

She left a note telling friends not to be sad if they saw her on television or in the newspapers, adding: 'I just want to end my life.'

Cornwall coroner Dr Emma Carlyon ruled out that it was a cry for help, telling Courtney's tearful family that she had made ‘dark writings about how hard growing up was at this time’ and the ‘social pressures on her’.

The coroner said poems and writings in books were found in her bedroom as well as internet research into suicide in the hours before she died.

Dr Carlyon told the family: 'No one could have seen this coming'.

Courtney, who was found dead by her mother on January 6 this year, did not suffer any mental illness but there was evidence she worried about failing at school, the coroner ruled.

She added: 'The police found evidence that Courtney was contemplating suicide and looked up about failing school.

'Bright but anxious': The coroner said poems and writings in books were found in Courtney's bedroom as well as internet research into suicide in the hours before she died

Troubled: The inquest heard Courtney was 
concerned 'about the state of the world' and the prospect of spending 
the 'rest of her life in debt' if she followed her to University

'She had spoken to others about this. She was concerned at how hard it was to be growing up at this time as a teenager.

'There was a suicide note found in her room and there was no evidence of any third party being involved.'

The inquest was told Courtney was also upset by her family’s recent move from Truro to Redruth which left her missing friends.

She was spending more and more time alone and told friends at Penair School near Truro that she ‘did not care about dying’.

Her half sister Donna, 22, to whom she was close, revealed that Courtney was concerned 'about the state of the world' and the prospect 
of spending the 'rest of her life in debt' if she followed her to 
University.

Tormented: She had become so concerned that, in the days before her death, she had Googled the phrase 'failing at school'

Playful: Her mum Agnes said her youngest child was 'very bright, intellectual and creative' but always compared herself to other people

She added: 'Courtney asked me what I did at her age because there was nothing to do. She said she hated being a teenager in this decade.'

The inquest heard how Courtney also complained that live bands were stopped from playing because of the noise they made and 'regulations were getting in the way of fun and stopping expressing themselves’.

And while she did not have a boyfriend, some of her girlfriends did which made her feel a 'gooseberry'.

Her mother, Agnes, said her youngest child was ‘very bright, intellectual and creative’ but always compared herself to other people, adding: 'She got bogged down with 
worry about what to do with her life. I really did not see this coming. 
It is so terribly tragic and out of the blue.'

Popular: Courtney's family described her as a 'regular teenager, with a good circle of friends, that was doing well at school'

Lonely: She was spending more and more time alone and told friends at Penair school near Truro that she 'did not care about dying'

'She switched off, this was someone else completely, not the actions of my daughter.'

Her father, a company director, told the hearing: 'A lot of factors all built up. The New Year party had been cancelled, her mother had a car accident the day before, different things all built up and it was too much for her.'

Speaking after the inquest, Courtney’s mother Agnes said: 'Today, our family is coming to terms with the loss of its youngest member - our daughter, sister and granddaughter.

'She was a regular teenager, with a good circle of friends, and was doing well at school.

'She gave absolutely no reason for anyone to believe that such a devastating tragedy was about to unfold.

'This is the dark nature of mental health issues and suicidal thoughts - they’re often invisible. Only by talking will these issues come to light.'

Verdict: Suicide by hanging.
