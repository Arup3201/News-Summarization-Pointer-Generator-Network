The Citizens Advice Bureau is charging callers to its helpline up to 41p a minute. The service gives advice on numerous debt-related issues as well as employment, legal problems and housing

People ringing a government-backed helpline for advice on debt and benefits are being charged up to 41p a minute for the service, reports today suggest.

The Citizens Advice Bureau helpline - which gives impartial advice on numerous debt-related issues as well as employment, legal issues and housing - uses 0844 and 0845 numbers.

According to Ofcom, calls from mobile phones to 0844 numbers are charged up to 41p a minute. Landline users are charged up to 13p.

Calls from mobiles to 0845 numbers also cost up to 41p a minute, with landlines up to 11p - the regulator says.

The Citizens Advice website says charges from 0845 numbers are around 3p per minute from a BT landline.

However, it concedes that: 'Charges from other networks may vary and mobiles may cost considerably more.'

Furthermore, those wishing to report other organisations to Citizens' Advice for using high-rate numbers must call their 084 helpline.

Citizens Advice is a government-backed service. Last year, government departments were ordered to stop using higher-rate phone lines.

Cabinet Office guidance stated it was 'inappropriate for callers to pay 
substantial charges for accessing core public services, particularly for
 vulnerable and low income groups.'

Figures according to Ofcom

Is suggested a move to 01 02 or 03 
numbers - the latter of which was created specifically for non-profit 
organisations and government departments.

A spokesman from the organisation said today the bureau are moving to 03 numbers in September.

Calls to 03 numbers cost no more than a national rate call to a home or business 01 or 02 number.

Depending on your provider these cost between 10p and 40p a minute.

Today, Citizens Advice Head of 
Telephones Michele Shambrook said: 'It has always been our ambition to 
minimise calling costs and by September almost all of our phonelines 
will run from 03 numbers.

'This means calling our helplines will cost no more than calls to a geographic number.

'Citizens Advice has been working hard to secure funding to provide the lowest cost advice calls available for some time – that’s simply common knowledge.

'Anyone who runs a phoneline taking 2 million calls every year knows about the high costs of infrastructure. The advice we give is free and we make no money from the phonelines. 

'At Citizens Advice we’re proud to say that not only can people get advice over the phone, we also deliver advice face to face to over 2 million people and online to 15 million people every year which is always completely cost-free.'

A National Audit Office report found numbers starting 0845 or 0870 cost callers £56m in 2012.
