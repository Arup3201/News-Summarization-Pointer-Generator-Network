Chelsea Clinton has added another title to her resume as she received her doctorate degree from Oxford University on Saturday.

The former first daughter was joined by her husband and famous parents as she collected her diploma from the prestigious university.

She began her doctorate degree program in 2011 and completed most of the coursework from New York, where she and her husband Marc Mezvinsky live.

All smiles: The former President and Secretary of State joined their daughter Chelsea and her husband Marc Mezvinsky at her doctorate graduation ceremony in Oxford on Saturday

The doctorate: Chelsea, 34, has been working on her PhD for the past three years

Runs in the family: Her father Bill studied at Oxford for two years as a Rhodes Scholar

The graduation ceremony was the first big accomplishment in a year that is expected to be full of milestones for the political family.

Chelsea, 34, announced that she is pregnant with her first child and is due in the fall.

Her mother, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, is largely seen as the front runner in the Democratic field for the 2016 presidential race and though she has not officially declared her bid, that is expected after the midterm elections this fall.

Like her father, she first went to Oxford to get her master's degree immediately after her undergraduate studies at Stanford University.

Faces in the crowd: University spokesmen said that the former President and his wife were at the campus in a 'private capacity'

The shades are back: Hillary Clinton whipped out her sunglasses- which were the subject of an internet meme- after the ceremony

Walking through history: Chelsea announced that she and Marc are expecting their first child this fall

Following their footsteps: A crew of security guards trailed the Clintons throughout

She returned to the U.S. after finishing her master's in 2003, but then started a second degree at the school in 2011.

She has been working on the dissertation focusing on international global governance structures with a focus on global health.

Chelsea has also taken a much more active role in the family's charitable foundation this year and was named vice chairwoman of the organization.

Bill Clinton got his undergraduate degree at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. but won a Rhodes Scholarship when he graduated and headed back to school.

Specialized expertise: Chelsea's dissertation was about international global governance structures with a focus on global health

Getting together: The Clintons gathered and checked in on their cell phones before going to celebrate

Proud parents: 2014 is going to be a big year for the Clintons as they will become grandparents for the first time and Hillary is expected to announce her second presidential run

Sharing the moment: The social media-savy family didn't post anything about their trip to Oxford until after the graduation ceremony was over

Latest achievement: Chelsea Clinton now has four degrees

He studied philosophy, politics and economics at University College at Oxford from 1968 until 1970.

He never ended up earning a degree from the school because he left early and returned to the United States to study law at Yale, where he would meet his soon-to-be wife.

The former President recently joked about how academically ambitious his daughter was during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live.

'She'll have as many (degrees) as her parents do - combined,' he joked.

'When she was younger, the way all kids 
are, she thought she knew more than I did about everything. But alas, in
 my dotage, it turned out to be true!'

Old stomping grounds: Mr Clinton spent a year studying at the school as part of a Rhodes Scholarship program after he received his undergraduate degree at Georgetown

Taking in the country: The former President stopped to snap a picture of a bull with his camera phone

Though the couple apparently hoped to stay under the radar on this weekend's trip, they were pictured taking a leisurely stroll in the picturesque town on Friday afternoon before Chelsea arrived.

At one point, the former President 
stopped to take a picture of a bull who was behind a fence on the side 
of the road using the camera on his phone.

It doesn't look like that was intended to be shared, however.Â 

Both Clintons are active Twitter users but have kept their posts to a minimum and gave no hints about the intention of the trip on their social media accounts.

Bill Clinton must be feeling slightly nostalgic of late because he gave a speech at Georgetown nearly two weeks ago and turned to Twitter to thank the students for coming out to listen to his speech in spite of bad weather.
