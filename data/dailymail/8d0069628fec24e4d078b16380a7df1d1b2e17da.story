Some councils have shaved the rates that they pay companies to care for the elderly and frail

Firms which care for the elderly are being forced to break minimum wage laws due to a lack of council funding, the head of a government body has warned.

Some councils have shaved the rates that they pay companies to care for the elderly and frail, David Norgrave of the Low Pay Commission revealed.

Mr Norgrove told the Guardian that the scaling back of funding was so quick that firms have managed to avoid paying the £6.31-an-hour minimum pay rate.

He claimed that the commission has been told that Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has identified 120 care providers for investigation.

To cut costs, care companies are allegedly using tactics such as not paying for travel time between care visits, so that they don't have to pay the minimum wage.

United Kingdom Homecare Association estimates that a homecare company needs to be paid a minimum of £14.95 an hour by a council to fulfill wage law and training responsibilities.

But it believes that one in five councils were now paying £11 or less, the lowest being £8.98 an hour.

The association said that 90 per cent of councils had slashed its members payments in the past year, leaving them struggling to comply with the minimum wage law - the alternative being they stop trading or go out of business.

Norman Lamb, the care minister, told the newspaper that he had asked the Care Quality Commission to see whether staff who work more hours than they should for less than the minimum wage could guarantee that they received care to a high standard.

The minister accepted that there are far too many employers paying people less than the minimum wage by not taking account of travel time, which was unacceptable.

It comes after a poll in September revealed that more than a quarter of care home residents are treated no better than children at meal times.

And nearly as many families say their relative does not get enough help with eating and drinking.

The YouGov poll, of 1,588 people, found that 28 per cent of those with a relative or a friend in care said that they had sometimes been treated like children at meal times.

Research chief James McCoy said: ‘With so many residents needing help with their meals, staff in homes need to make sure they are treated in a professional and sympathetic manner.’

The findings come seven years after Tony Blair’s government launched guidelines for care home and hospital staff demanding patients and residents be treated with dignity.

It also follows the Mail’s Dignity for the Elderly campaign which has highlighted the mistreatment of care home residents.

More than half of the families questioned said their loved ones needed help to eat and nearly half said relatives needed help to drink.

But 15 per cent of families with relatives currently in care said they were not getting enough help to eat. Of those with  relatives in care over the past five years the figure was 26 per cent.

The numbers were similar in respect to liquids. Despite this, 53 per cent said care home food was better than that at NHS hospitals.

The findings come after it was revealed four out of five councils have restricted home help to those who are 'critically' in need of it.
