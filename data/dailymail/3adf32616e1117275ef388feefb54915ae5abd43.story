BBC Sport will receive a hammer blow on Monday, the morning after their flagship Sports Personality of the Year show, with news they have lost Football League highlights rights to Channel 5.

The Football League are due to announce a three-year deal with C5 for all their divisions plus the Capital One Cup, starting next season.

C5 won the contract with an estimated offer of £2million a year, which was marginally better than the BBC’s, and a pledge to screen their show at 9pm on Saturday.

Match of the Day may be limited to FA Cup highlights

This was seen by the Football League as a far better way to promote their product than being put in the graveyard slot after Match of the Day, even if there is more cache in having the Beeb as rights-holders.

And certainly Saturday prime-time for the Football League will not bring the derogatory chants of ‘Thursday nights, Channel 5’ that greeted teams dropping out of the Champions League into the C5-screened Europa League.

Meanwhile, the nightmare scenario facing the BBC is that the loss of their Football League contract will be followed next February with ITV outbidding them for their prized Premier League highlights.

That is the likely outcome, with ITV having money to spend on football after losing the Champions League and the FA Cup, but not enough for live Premier League packages.

Gary Lineker and Co would then be left with only the FA Cup and the major tournaments they share with ITV.

BBC Sports Personality showed its great pulling power on Sunday night when Olympic skeleton champion Lizzy Yarnold, one of the 10 athletes short-listed for the top prize, made a three-flight journey from Lake Placid in the USA to be in Glasgow, despite her slim chance of winning. 

Other awards ceremonies struggle to attract sports stars across London unless they have been guaranteed a gong.

Gary Neville leading the Manchester United counter to City’s £200m state-of-the art training centre, saying academies are about people rather than buildings, isn’t necessarily supported by his brother and Class of 92 team-mate Phil. 

He sent his son to the City academy before the grand opening, as did Robin van Persie, Darren Fletcher and United ambassador Andy Cole.

Bearing in mind how paranoid Sky Sports are about the challenge from BT, and Isleworth staff going off message on social media, Sky Sports News reporter James Cole might find himself in trouble even for tweeting: ‘Happy to hear Dover v Crystal Palace will be televised. Great news for the non-League club.’ BT are broadcasting the match.

The IAAF blame game

International athletics chiefs have only themselves to blame for the list of 150 competitors with suspicious blood readings from 2006-08 — which includes a famous Briton — continuing to be a major talking point.

The document, seen by Sports Agenda, is simply a list of names and was being shown to media attending the IOC Congress by German TV station ARD. So IAAF communications chief Nick Davies, rather than moan about the reporting three days later, should have been briefing journalists in Monaco as to why the list in isolation is a long way from doping evidence.

The saga has also deflected attention from the more serious allegations on German TV about a systematic doping regime in Russia.

World Cup dates for Qatar 2022 will be discussed at the FIFA ExCo meeting in Morocco this week. 

November and December, despite Premier League opposition, now looks the only viable option. January-February — suggested by FIFA’s task force — will not happen. 

IOC president Thomas Bach was adamant at the IOC Congress that FIFA president Sepp Blatter had promised the World Cup would not interfere with the 2022 Winter Olympics.

With all the scrutiny on top referees, it seemed odd that Professional Game Match Officials technical director Howard Webb was sent to referee an Under 12 tournament in Ypres as part of the First World War anniversary events rather than keep a close eye on the weekend’s Premier League performances. 

A PL spokesman said Webb was their ambassador at the event.
