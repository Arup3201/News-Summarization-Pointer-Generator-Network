Mitt Romney has made yet another gaffe by confusing ‘Sikh’ and ‘Sheikh’ whilst talking about the massacre at a Wisconsin Sikh temple.

The Republican Presidential candidate twice confused the two terms and referred to the victims as the ‘Shiekh people’ who had been worshipping in a ‘Sheikh temple’.

Sheikh is a Muslim term for the leader of a tribe or village.

Confused: Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, seen in Iowa on Wednesday, twice confused the 'Sikh' and 'Sheikh' whilst talking about the recent shooting at a Wisconsin Sikh temple

Sikhs are not Muslims, although they have complained repeatedly about being confused for them since the 9/11 attacks, which were carried out by Islamists.

The blunder is the latest in a string of gaffes after Romney caused deep offence in Britain and Palestine on a recent foreign tour.

It came during a tribute to the six people who were killed and the three who were critically injured during the rampage at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in Oak Creek.

Gunman Michael Page was shot dead at the scene.

Different faiths: Two victims of the shooting are pictured at a memorial for the Indian Sikhs, who are not Muslims but widely confused as being so since 9/11

At a fundraising event in Iowa Romney said: ‘We had a moment of silence in honour of the people who lost their lives at that sheikh temple. I noted that it was a tragedy for many, many reasons.

1.  'It's hard to know just how well it will turn out ... There are a few things that were disconcerting'

- on London hosting the Summer Olympics last July

2.  ‘I’m also unemployed'

- speaking to job hunters in Florida  in June, 2011

3.  'I like being able to fire people who provide services to me'

- speaking last January in New Hampshire

4.  'I’m not concerned about the very poor. We have a safety net there'

- in an interview in Florida last February

5. 'We're going to hang [Obama] with that. So to speak. Metaphorically. You have to be careful these days'

- in April 2011 in New Hampshire

‘Among them are the fact that people, the sheikh people, are among the most peaceable and loving individuals you can imagine, as is their faith.’

Romney's spokesman Rick Gorka said the error was simply because the candidate ‘mis-spoke’.

He said: ‘He mispronounced similar sounding words. He was clearly referring to the tragedy in Wisconsin’.

On his recent foreign tour, his first foreign trip as a presidential candidate, Romney was branded ‘Mitt the Twit’ and ‘Party Pooper’ by the British for suggesting the London Games would be a failure.

Romney, who has been credited with rescuing the 2002 Salt Lake City Games, was also attacked by British Prime Minister David Cameron who said it was unfair to compare having The Games in London with hosting the event in a city which is ‘in the middle of nowhere’.

Romney also had to play down comments 
by one of his advisors that he understood the relationship between the 
US and the UK better than President Obama because he appreciated its 
shared ‘Anglo Saxon heritage’.

During
a subsequent stop in Israel Romney was condemned as ‘racist’ by 
Palestinians for suggesting that Israel was succeeding in comparison to 
its Arab neighbours

He 
said: ‘And as I come here and I look out over this city and consider the
accomplishments of the people of this nation, I recognise the power of 
at least culture and a few other things’.

Romney caused further outrage by saying 
that Jerusalem was the capital of Israel - Palestinians consider the 
East half of the city to be theirs but it has been occupied by Israel 
since 1967.

Campaigning: Romney's latest gaffe came during a fundraising event in Iowa, where he also looked at corn with Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Bill Northey (center) and farmer Lemar Koethe (left)

Misspoke: A Romney spokesperson said the error was simply because the candidate misspoke and was clearly referring to the tragedy in Wisconsin

If Romney continues making such blunders he is in danger of overtaking Joe Biden as the most gaffe-prone politician in American politics.

The vice president caused blushing all round in March when made a crass gag about lubrication whilst at a White House reception for Irish prime minister Enda Kenny.

At his first campaign rally with President Obama after being selected as his running mate for the 2008 US election, Biden told a crowd: ‘A man I'm proud to call my friend. A man who will be the next President of the United States - Barack America!’

During another town hall meeting in Nashua, New Hampshire, Biden also said that Hillary Clinton, who ran for the Democratic nomination in 2008 but lost out to Mr Obama, ‘might have been a better pick than me’ as vice president.
