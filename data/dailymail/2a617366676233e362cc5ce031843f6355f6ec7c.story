She wasn’t exactly famed for her small-talk, but Lady Thatcher nonetheless came up with a splendidly disarming icebreaker when she was first introduced to Mandy Rice-Davies.

It was the late-Eighties, and our then Prime Minister had agreed to accompany her husband Denis to an intimate dinner with a business acquaintance of his, called Ken Foreman, and his new wife.

Worryingly, for all concerned, that new wife just happened to be Rice-Davies — the former model and nightclub dancer who, as a key player in the Profumo scandal, had come within a whisker of bringing down a Conservative government.

Rice-Davies was a figure of notoriety: a brash and outspoken former good-time girl who rubbed shoulders with gangsters, seduced Tory grandees, and had, for a quarter of a century, given raucous newspaper interviews about her colourful love life.

Thrice-married, she had, just a few years earlier, at the age of 38, starred in an X-rated erotic film called Nana, based on Emile Zola’s book of the same name.

Yet if Margaret Thatcher was in any way put off by this femme fatale’s track record, she didn’t show it. Instead, shortly after shaking hands, the Prime Minister turned to Rice-Davies and asked a question.

‘Tell me,’ she asked, ‘how do you manage to keep your lipstick on?’

This was, Rice-Davis later told friends, a serious question.

‘Mandy always used to wear very full lipstick, and it would never rub off,’ says the journalist Tom Mangold, a longstanding acquaintance. ‘I think Mrs Thatcher genuinely wanted to know how she managed that.’

It would also prove a superbly-effective way of the PM setting her nervous guest at ease. For the ensuing chat marked the start of a fond personal friendship between these outwardly very different women.

Following Rice-Davies’s death from cancer last week at the age of 70, it has emerged that this unlikely duo would eventually become so well-acquainted as to spend time on holiday together in the Nineties.

Though she never spoke publicly about their relationship, and succeeded in keeping it from being reported by the Press during Thatcher’s lifetime, it appears that Rice-Davies counted photographs of those trips among her most valued possessions.

She kept two of them — one in a tartan frame — at the flat in Lowdnes Square, Knightsbridge, where she and Foreman stayed when they weren’t at their home in Virginia Water, Surrey, or their holiday homes in the Bahamas and Florida.

‘There was one picture of Mandy and Margaret together, and one of them and their two husbands, I think standing on some sort of balcony,’ says the author Peter Stanford, who visited the flat in 1996. ‘I think she kept one on her desk, and one on the sitting room wall.

What I found interesting was that Mandy would always be very forthcoming when you asked her a question — very open and honest. But when I asked, she would hardly talk about the pictures at all. It was almost as if the friendship was one of the few things in her life she wanted to keep secret.’

Stanford, who visited the flat while researching a biography of Bronwen Astor, matriarch of Cliveden, the stately home where the Profumo scandal played out, wasn’t the only writer to get a tantalising insight into the two couples’ secret relationship.

The historian Richard Davenport-Hines, who recently published a book on Profumo, told in an obituary of Rice-Davies published at the weekend, how Denis Thatcher, who sat alongside Ken Foreman on the board of a U.S. waste disposal firm called Attwoods, also became a regular visitor to their home.

‘During the Downing Street years, Denis would pop over for cheery drinking sessions in the Foremans’ Knightsbridge home when he felt bored or neglected,’ he wrote.

During that first dinner at which the two women met, Thatcher was less talkative than usual, Davenport-Hines believes. ‘She fixed her eyes on Mandy, gazed intently at her, trying to pierce the secrets of her very different brand of femininity, both intrigued and guarded in the company of a Sixties icon.’

Yet for all their outward differences, Rice-Davies and Thatcher were in many important ways cut from the same cloth.

‘Mandy loved human comedy — and appreciated it more saucily than Margaret Thatcher,’ added Davenport-Hines. ‘But the two women had many splendid similarities.

‘They faced the hostility that is often meted out to game-changing innovators. They refused to take the world on men’s terms — and in their very different spheres they left it a very different place.’ 

Both women came from humble backgrounds and were raised by small businessmen in provincial England. Lady Thatcher is pictured with her husband, Denis

Both came from humble backgrounds, and were raised by small businessmen in provincial England. Rice-Davies grew up in suburban Solihull, the daughter of a former policeman who set up a tyre-sales business. Thatcher’s father was a shopkeeper in Grantham, Lincolnshire.

Both also demonstrated an uncanny knack of (and perhaps passion for) upsetting the Establishment.

Rice-Davies was 16 years old when she decided, in 1960, to move to London in search of adventure. After getting a job as a nightclub hostess, she met the notorious slum landlord Peter Rachman, who was 41, overweight and very rich, and installed her as his mistress.

Following Rachman’s death two years later, she and a striking 19-year-old friend, Christine Keeler, moved into a London flat owned by Stephen Ward, a society osteopath. 

Within weeks, they were at the centre of a scandal that threatened to bring down the government after it emerged that Keeler had slept with both John Profumo, the Secretary of State for War, and Yevgeny Ivanov, a Soviet naval attache.

Though never directly implicated in the Profumo affair, Rice-Davies was called to give evidence at a court case in which Ward was accused of living off the ‘immoral earnings’ of his two tenants — a charge that implied, wrongly, that they were prostitutes.

In the witness box at the Old Bailey, she then made the sensational claim that one of her lovers had been Viscount ‘Bill’ Astor, Bronwen’s husband and the owner of Cliveden. When it was put to her that Astor denied this, she retorted: ‘Well he would, wouldn’t he?’

The response was remarkable for its impertinence in an era when working-class girls were not supposed to traduce the reputations of wealthy men. It has since entered the Oxford Dictionary Of Quotations, and is said to have hastened the upending of traditional class hierarchies in the Swinging Sixties.

In a different sphere and era, Mrs Thatcher was similarly unsettling to the old order. The first woman prime minister, her decision to contest the Tory leadership in 1975 upset a raft of Establishment figures on her own front bench.

Both women were, of course, known for their free-thinking.

In office, Thatcher spent much of her reign challenging political orthodoxies. Rice-Davies devoted much of her life to challenging social ones. In numerous interviews, for example, she would highlight the inherent unfairness in the fact that men were admired for having sexual experiences, while women were scorned for it.

Were it not for their independent spirits, they would perhaps never have met. For a less free-thinking Prime Minister than Thatcher might have shied away from any association with Rice-Davies, for fear of the negative publicity it might attract. That, however, is not how the Iron Lady operated.

‘Mrs T was very open-minded,’ is how her former Private Secretary Robin Harris puts it. ‘She wouldn’t have refused to go along somewhere or to meet someone because of their reputation. She took people as she found them.’

So it proved with Mandy Rice-Davies.

And while few Conservative grandees would like the two ladies to be mentioned in the same breath (‘I’m not sure if opening your legs is the same thing as reforming the economy,’ comments one long-time Thatcher confidant), there was plenty that these two splendidly unlikely friends had in common.
