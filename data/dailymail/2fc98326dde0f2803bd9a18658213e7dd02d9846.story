When Adriano Galliani, the chief executive of AC Milan, sold Mario Balotelli to Liverpool for £16m, he told friends it had ‘felt like winning the lottery’.

Balotelli’s agent Mino Raiola had done a number on Liverpool, telling them that he could get the Italian forward out of Milan on the cheap. In their desperation to replace Luis Suarez, they fell for it.

In return, Raiola’s pockets were lined and Liverpool are even understood to have added the five per cent (£800,000) solidarity fee, which is paid to his former clubs, as part of the package.

It will cost Liverpool a lot of money to get shot of him this month, but fronting up and accepting that they have made a mistake with him is the best thing they can do.

Chelsea persisted and persisted with Fernando Torres after they bought him from Liverpool for £50m in 2011, picking up his wages for nearly four years in the hope that it would all come right eventually. It rarely does.

Robbie Keane lasted just six months at Liverpool before he returned to his selling club Tottenham. It happens and players can be moved on.

Finding a buyer for Balotelli in this transfer window, or any other for that matter, will not be easy for Liverpool’s chief executive Ian Ayre.

The days when he was man of the moment, winning the prestigious Golden Boy award in 2010 after being voted the best young player in Europe, are long gone.

Balotelli has scored twice for Liverpool, once in the Champions League against Ludogorets and another in the Capital One Cup against Swansea City since his arrival from the San Siro.

Clearly Liverpool expected more.

On Monday evening, in an FA Cup third-round tie at AFC Wimbledon, who are 12th in League Two, Balotelli could not get a game ahead of Rickie Lambert.

Even after his appearance as a substitute there was a report that he flounced off when he was told to warm down on the pitch at the Kingsmeadow with one of Liverpool’s fitness coaches.

Everybody has tried and failed with Balotelli: Roberto Mancini (twice), Jose Mourinho, Massimiliano Allegri, Clarence Seedorf, Cesare Prandelli and Antonio Conte.

When a manager with Mourinho’s stature cannot get through to him, you do have to wonder what Brendan Rodgers was thinking when he agreed to sign the forward. Balotelli is not about to come good.

Everybody has their own favourite Balotelli story, but the trouble is that none of them reflect well on him.

Mourinho has refined his story about Balotelli’s dismissal against Rubin Kazan in the Champions League over the years, but remove the poetic licence and the sentiment is clear.

‘Mario got a yellow card in the 42nd minute (it was actually the 20th), so when I got to the dressing room at half-time I spend about 14 minutes of the 15 available speaking only to Mario.

'I said to him: “Mario, I cannot change you, I have no strikers (he had named two keepers) on the bench, so don't touch anybody and play only with the ball. If we lose the ball no reaction. If someone provokes you, no reaction, if the referee makes a mistake, no reaction.”

'The 46th minute – red card!' (He was actually sent off in the 60th).

When he was a player at Manchester City, club officials were not even certain that he would turn up at Villa Park to play Chelsea in the Community Shield in 2012 because it coincided with his birthday.

Balotelli had been out with friends the night before and when he eventually arrived, Mancini did not even name him on the bench.

Most recently Conte, who replaced Prandelli as Italy coach after the 2014 World Cup, sent him home early from international duty. He told Balotelli he will not be selected again.

Since his return from the suspension imposed on him by the FA following his offensive re-tweet, his status within the dressing room has shifted markedly.

Rodgers had always maintained that Balotelli has never caused him a moment’s trouble since his arrival from Milan and consistently claims that the forward is working hard to improve.

In recent weeks, though, the Liverpool manager has admitted that Balotelli has struggled to adapt to the team’s ethos of a high-pressing game.

Instead he has played Raheem Sterling in a central role, with some success after a false start in the 3-0 defeat against Manchester United at Old Trafford just before the turn of the year.

At the front of house, Rodgers continues to believe in Balotelli and yet the task behind the scenes is to convince the forward that Anfield is not quite for him.

If they can make the numbers work, now is the time to let him go.
