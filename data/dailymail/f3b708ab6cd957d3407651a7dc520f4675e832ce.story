Fighting for life: Preston Flores suffered 8% burns after being set on fire in Aberdeen

A seven-year-old boy was last night fighting for his life in hospital after being turned into a human fireball.

Preston Flores ran into the street ‘on fire’ near his home in Aberdeen after his clothes became doused in petrol and ignited.

The youngster, who is thought to have suffered 80 per cent burns, may have been deliberately set on fire – or been the victim of a prank gone wrong.

Last night, he remained in a ‘serious’ condition in hospital, with his mother Luisza at his bedside.

When asked if police were conducting a criminal inquiry, Detective Inspector Lorna Ferguson said: ‘It’s too early to say at the moment.’

However, Police Scotland later confirmed that officers at the scene in Bedford Avenue were following ‘a positive line of inquiry’.

Eyewitnesses told how they watched in horror as the boy, screaming in agony, suddenly appeared with flames licking all around one side of his body.

One described the shocking scene as Preston was on fire from the neck downwards, his clothes sticking to him  as he lay terrified on the ground.

Another said someone handed the youngster a bucket of water, which he immediately poured over himself in a  desperate attempt to put out the fire.

Victoria Pirie, 17, last night told how she heard screams as the boy ran into the back garden of his block of flats, yelling and crying. She said: ‘It was just horrid. He was on fire from the neck downwards, his clothes were sticking to him. They weren’t really big but they were enough to do a lot of damage to him.’

Earlier, the schoolboy had been outside enjoying the fine weather, playing with two friends, a boy and a girl, in the street near his home.

The tragedy happened shortly before 2pm yesterday afternoon.

Local resident Paulina Pilska said she had been watching the children from her window as they jumped on top of a council pick-up van.

The 25-year-old cleaner said: ‘They were searching for something. I saw one of them with a container, like a watering can.’

Minutes later, Preston was running around  outside the block of flats with flames shooting from his clothes.

Miss
 Pilska said the other children were trying to put him on the ground but
 he was shouting, although not very loudly at that stage.

She added: ‘I was shocked.’

Emergency
 services were called to the scene and although firefighters arrived 
within three minutes, Preston is understood to have suffered serious 
injuries, with 80 per cent burns to his body.

Shortly
 afterwards, his mother, who had just returned to their flat from the 
shops, learned of the accident after neighbours began banging on her 
door. Residents said the mother-of-five collapsed on the ground when she
 saw her son.

Paramedics gave her oxygen and she was taken away in the ambulance with young Preston.

Police
 cordoned off two streets as they carried out detailed investigations to
 establish the exact circumstances surrounding the tragedy.

As
 stunned neighbours huddled together, some in tears, they watched police
 officers scour a grassy lane between two blocks of flats.

Resident Shona Henderson, 16, said: ‘I saw clothes lying all over the ground and his shoes and the fire still there.

Emergency crews were called to the scene shortly before 2pm and he was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for treatment

Shocked local resident Paulina Pilska said she watched the boy running from the side of a building with flames all over one side of his body

‘By the time we got there, his clothes were sticking to his skin, it looked like they had melted into his skin. It was horrible.

‘There
 were lots of people around him. Someone handed him a bucket of water 
and he poured it all over himself. He was screaming.’

Preston
 was taken by an ambulance under police escort to the Royal Aberdeen 
Children’s Hospital, where medical staff carried out emergency surgery.

Last night, it was believed he had been flown to a specialist burns unit at an Edinburgh hospital for further care.

Police last night confirmed that their investigations were continuing.

Residents said the boy is believed to have had fuel on his clothes which somehow ignited

DI
 Ferguson said: ‘We are appealing for witnesses in relation to the 
incident and inquiries are at an early stage at the minute until we 
establish exactly what happened. We’re speaking to witnesses to 
establish the circumstances.’

Local councillor Nathan Morrison expressed his sympathy to the family.

He
 said: ‘My heart goes out to this young boy who was in this terrible 
incident. I will be rooting for him to make a full recovery, as I’m sure
 everyone else will.

‘There needs to be a police investigation into this matter.’

Councillor
 Jean Morrison said the whole of Aberdeen would be shocked, adding: ‘I 
would imagine the police will investigate to see if there is anything 
behind it.

‘I would hope that this young boy is OK and that he can recover. It’s truly awful. My thoughts are with the parents.’
