The Massachusetts woman who was found murdered alongside her infant twin sons and her estranged husband Monday posted a plea for help on a parenting site weeks before her grisly demise.

Mei Kum Jones, 43, wrote on Massachusetts Mothers of Twins Association website on September 30: 'I will soon be a single mom to my twin boys.'

Her troubled husband Scott Jones, also 43, hasn't been named as the killer who slashed the throats of Colt and Cameron-who would have turned one this month-- and strangled his wife, but police say they aren't searching for suspects.

'I need to find a way to cope': Mei Kum Jones and her twin sons Colt and Cameron (pictured) were found dead at home along with her husband. Jones sought divorce advice on a parenting site in September

What's still unknown is what sort of discord led to such a tragedy.

The 
discovery of Mei's post asking for advice including where to find a 
'good divorce attorney' is further evidence of their marital strife.

Relatives have said that they were in the middle of a 'nasty divorce' and the comments appear to confirm as much.

'It
breaks my heart for the boys to grow up in a divorce family,' she 
wrote. 'Their dad will probably not be in their lives either. I need to 
find a way to cope.'

Unfortunately, any advice she may have gotten did her no good.

The
couple, who lived on a quiet street in Arlington were discovered on 
Monday afternoon. The cause of Mr. Jones' death wasn't immediately 
apparent.

The Arlington
Chief of Police added that there is no risk to the public safety and 
that police aren't looking for a suspect. They were called to the scene 
by another tenant in the building who requested a well-being check.

Investigation: Police dress in booties to enter the crime scene where the bodies of two adults and two young children were found this afternoon in Arlington, Massachusetts

Unidentified: The district attorney still hasn't identified the bodies, as they wait to contact the deceased's next of kin

Police had previously been called to the 
home on two different occasions before the twins were born last year.

In the summer of 2010, they were called to the Arlington home after Scott Jones threatened to kill himself.

The Boston Herald reports that the reason for the second call has not been revealed.

The Middlesex District Attorney told The Boston Globe
that the deaths were 'very troubling, very tragic situation,' but they 
would not reveal any further details about the crime scene except to say
that the family died violently. 

Neighbors
described Mrs Jones as attentive to her children while Mr Jones has 
been portrayed as obsessed with home improvement projects, as some 
people saw him pull up flowers that he had just planted before replacing
them all over again.

No suspect: In a press conference this afternoon, the chief of police said that they are currently not looking for a suspect in the case and that neighbors need not worry about public safety

'There were signs of trouble,' said Clare MacFarlane, whose mother is the Jones' next door neighbor.

'He’s just busy — busy, busy, busy, busy. Always fixing something, doing something, digging. He was always working on the house.

'I’m horrified. I’m horrified. Those poor babies.'

Scott Jones, a longtime Boston-area paramedic, 
had filed a lawsuit accusing his former employer of inflicting severe 
emotional distress by firing him when he complained about faulty medical
equipment, the attorney said.

Attorney
Timothy Burke, who represents Scott Jones in the lawsuit, filed three 
weeks ago against LifeLine Ambulance Services, said Jones appeared happy
with his marriage and family.

'There was no indication that there is a problem internally whatsoever, just the opposite,' Burke said.

Court
documents, however, indicate that Jones was distressed that LifeLine 
Ambulance had fired him, saying in the lawsuit that he lost his job 
after complaining about a faulty medication pump that had endangered the
life of a disabled woman.

Jones
noted in the lawsuit that he was a decorated paramedic, having received
the highest award given to emergency medical technicians, the Star of 
Life Award, and a letter of recognition from then-U.S. Rep. Ed Markey 
for his efforts to save lives when an employee opened fire at an 
Internet consulting company in Wakefield, the Boston Globe reported 
Tuesday.

Seven people were 
killed when the assailant, wielding a shotgun and a rifle, shot 
colleagues before being subdued by police in December 2000.

Tragedy in the suburbs: The bodies were found in Arlington, Massachusetts, a suburb about twenty minutes northwest of Boston

She also told The Herald that Mr Jones had a son and daughter, ages 10 and 12 respectively, from an earlier marriage.

That marriage ended badly, it appears.

In addition to accusing Jones of having an affair with the neighbor's 18-year-old au pair, his ex-wife sought and won an abuse protection order covering herself and their two children.

She cited Jones' 'mental instability' and 'verbal and mental abuse.'

Mrs Jones' own brother old local station WBZ-TV that the couple was in the process of splitting up.

'I think he just moved out a couple of days ago, and I think she's going through the motion of the divorce,' Ben Li said.

'Arlington victim's brother tells me his sister was great person, loving mom. He is horrified at what's happened,' Kate Merrill tweeted.

She
had been previously married for four years from 2000 to 2004 and her ex
husband, who has not been named, spoke to The Globe about how he was 
shocked at the news.

'She was a very sweet, wonderful person. I can't imagine anyone wanting to do her any harm,' the man told the paper.

Mrs
Jones worked at a travel and education not-for-profit organization 
called Road Scholar and graduated from Bentley University which is near 
Arlington.

'Mei was a valued member of our team, and her loss is deeply felt by all of us,' Road Scholar said in a statement.

'As we grieve together, we can only imagine the impossible loss Mei’s family must bear, and our deepest sympathies are with them.'

The bodies were found at 45 Newland Road in Arlington, off Summer Street near Peirce Elementary School. Neighbors said that they didn't hear any gunshots last night.

A neighbor told WHDH that a couple lived in the bottom apartment where the bodies were found, and that they had twin boys under a year old. The neighbor said that the woman had purchased the condo about five years ago before getting married to her husband three years ago.

The tenants of the upper apartments were seen speaking with police outside the house before putting their own small child in their Subaru and driving off. The woman was clearly upset and being consoled by her husband.

In the same building: Tenants of the other condo in the building where four bodies were found leave their home this afternoon

So close: According to other neighbors on the street, the couple pictured lived on the upper floor of the building while another couple lived on the bottom floor where the four bodies were found

Out of there: The couple were seen packing up their belongings and speaking with police before leaving the crime scene

Neighbor John Belli was out raking leaves when his daughter came running home, afraid something had happened to him.

The police had blocked off traffic on the street four or five houses up from his.

He told Boston.com that there was a marked car at the end of one street and an unmarked car at the other and that helicopters were flying above.

Mr Belli has lived on the street for 47 years and describes the neighborhood as nice, quiet and kid-friendly. 

'I used to leave the doors open, but not anymore,' Mr Belli said.

Amy
Iannelli, a 74-year-old retired cleaning lady lives just a few houses 
away from the crime scene and doesn't remember police being called to 
the house before.

'I am heartsick to think that kids...' she started. 'It's heartbreaking.'

'It's a great neighborhood,' she added.
