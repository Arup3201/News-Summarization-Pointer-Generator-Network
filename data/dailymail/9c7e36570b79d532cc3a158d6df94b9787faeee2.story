A Melbourne tenant has been awarded nearly $1000 in compensation over a cracked toilet seat dispute.

Riley Nottingham, 23, took legal action after waiting four months to replace the broken seat at the one-bedroom Kensington rental apartment, north-west of Melbourne.

He told the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal the cracked toilet seat caused him injuries such as cuts to his skin, Nine Network's Today show reports.

The faulty toilet also prevented the budding actor from inviting guests to his home and particularly had concerns for women.

'There's sharp crack on the porcelain which means that if you sit on it, it cuts the skin,' he told Today.

'If a girl was to come over, they couldn't sit down without touching the porcelain.'

Mr Nottingham says he made numerous phone calls to his agent and was frustrated at how long it took for his matter to be resolved before he took it to court.

'If they take four months to fix it, it's just crap,' he told Today.

'It was a weird European model so I couldn't replace it myself.'

VCAT member Jessica Klingender said the cracked seat 'made the daily requirement of sitting on the toilet inconvenient, uncomfortable, potentially painful and unhygienic', the Herald Sun reports.

But Mr Nottingham has little hope of receiving his $933.57 payout as he is unable to contact his landlords Kim Wah Yong and Heng Lai Li.

'They were ordered to pay me compensation but now the issue is they're doing all kinds of things to not just pay that,' he said.

'The agent isn't giving me the address of the landlord and the magistrates court needs the address to get the money. So probably not going to get the money.'

The toilet has since been fixed however Mr Nottingham has moved out of the property.

'The issue has really bowled me over,' he said.
