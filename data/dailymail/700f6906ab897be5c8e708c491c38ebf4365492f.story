Four young children, including a baby and twin girls, died after a fire broke out in their Philadelphia home in the early hours of Saturday - and now officials are looking into the possibly that the deadly blaze was caused by a firecracker.

The fire, which started just before 3am, destroyed eight rowhouses and spread to a further 10, effectively wiping out an entire city block and leaving an estimated 42 people homeless.

The mother of two of the victims had tried desperately to save the children - her four-year-old twin daughters, a one-month-old boy, and a boy, also aged four - but was beaten back by the flames.

The children were named Saturday afternoon as twins Maria and Marialla Bowah, Patrick Sanyeah, four, and Taj Jacque, who was born in May.

The children were part of a group of 10 people staying at the home of the twins' mother, Dewen Bowah.

Bowah, a mother of seven, had managed to get her other three daughters out of the house, but the intense blaze stopped her reaching the four victims.

The 41-year-old had to jump from a second-story window to escape the blaze along with the tree girls identified as Naomi, Julie and Julisa Bowah.

Five of those who escaped from the house had to be treated for smoke inhalation, including two under the age of 13. Dewen Bowah was taken to a hospital in critical condition.

The victims were found in a front bedroom on the second floor of the house. The boys' mother, 23-year-old Eleanor Jacque, was not home at the time of the fire, Philly.com reported.

Sawyer told CNN: 'This is a tragic, tragic day for the city of Philadelphia. Tragic.'

Neighbor
 Jaka Kaba, whose house was damaged by the fire, said the young victims,
 whose names have not been released, were loved on the street.

'I

 knew them. Everyone knew them. They were good children. They didn't 
deserve this. No one expects this. It's hurting everyone,' she told Philly.com.

Abu Marrah told NBC Philadelphia the Bowah twins were sweet girls who loved wearing everything pink, earning them the nickname 'Pink Ladies' from him.

The neighbor said Maria and Marialla were inseparable and were usually seen playing outdoors.

‘When you see one of them, you see the other,’ Marrah added.

Just hours before the tragedy, Lorine Kamara saw the little girls and 4-year-old Patrick Sanyeah together on the sidewalk outside the row houses.

‘They were just playing and that's the last memory I have of them,’ said the neighbor.

When it 
was first reported, the fire was centered on three of the row houses, 
but it quickly moved to the surrounding properties which were linked by 
wooden porches.

Early investigations suggest that the fire may have started on a couch that was on one of the porches.

Saturday afternoon, witnesses came forward claiming they heard firecrackers explode just moments before the flames ignited at 2.45am.

It took about 100 firefighters to put out the 3-alarm blaze, which was said to be under control at 4.17am. When fire crews first arrived, they said the fire was burning intensely in four homes.

The heat from the blaze melted parts of cars parked along the street and damaged properties on the other side of the road.

Jeff Boone told Philly.com he had been playing video games when he stepped outside his house and saw a couch on fire on the neighbor's porch.

'It looked like someone had a flamethrower and just shot it all across,' he said, as he described watching the fire spread to other properties.

After getting his niece outside, Boone said he ran up and down the street trying to wake the neighbors.

'I was running, screaming, telling everybody, "Get up! Yo, get yo! Go!". The flames was just so intense, I couldn't see nothing from the smoke.'

He added: 'I hear the little kids upstairs screaming.'

Another neighbor, Milton Musa, said that as they ran to safety they saw two young children trying to escape from a window.

'I was afraid they'd fall to the cement. So I went underneath them, let them fall on my back and carried them away,' he said.

Musa, whose house was destroyed in the blaze, said: 'Everyone was running for their live. I've lost everything. My paperwork, my documents, my house. Everything.'

On Saturday afternoon, friends and neighbors gathered outside the row of damaged houses and held hands as they remembered the victims.

'We lost four precious lives. Four little, innocent children, in a horrific tragedy,' Mayor Anthony Nutter said at a press conference about the fire.

A shelter for the 42 residents displaced by the fire has been set up at a nearby high school.

It is not yet clear what started the blaze, but an investigation has been started. Some neighbors have suggested that a firecracker could be to blame.
