Some games from childhood last a lifetime and the 1990 FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Crystal Palace is one that has stayed with me.

I remember coming in from playing Sunday League football and being completely stunned that Liverpool could lose 4-3 to opponents like Palace. It was a defeat that stripped Liverpool’s aura of invincibility and, I felt, started the club’s demise.

There is no doubt Palace have been a bogey team for Liverpool. They shattered Brendan Rodgers’ hopes of bringing the title back to Anfield and the effects of that 3-3 draw were still being felt all the way through to last November, when Liverpool folded at Selhurst Park and were beaten 3-1.

Only after that defeat were Liverpool able to start recovering and while they head into Saturday night's FA Cup fifth-round tie with an opportunity to really build some momentum, the squad will be conscious of the threat Alan Pardew’s men pose.

It is the tie of the weekend, as Palace will be aiming to inflict further misery on Liverpool and dreaming of the chance to repeat their achievements of 1990 and get back to Wembley. They can be difficult opposition when the home crowd get behind them. This match, however, is huge for Liverpool.

With their hopes of getting into the top four still delicately balanced and a tough Europa League fixture against Besiktas looming, they cannot afford to let the FA Cup slip away.

They cannot suffer at the hands of their bogeymen again.
