It's the smile that says 'I walked out of that alive'.

These remarkable pictures capture the moment a woman is freed from the wreckage of her overturned car, and beams at her rescuers.

Her orange hatchback flipped over near The Bricklayers Arms pub in Hawks Road, Kingston, Surrey, on Sunday afternoon.

The moment a woman is freed from the wreckage of her overturned car - she had been sitting upside down in her car while waiting to be rescued

The driver was helped from the car by paramedics and fire crews and taken to Kingston Hospital. 

Pub landlady Zoe Day, whose pub is just yards from the scene, called the emergency services after hearing the crash.

She said: 'It was a perfectly quiet day and I was working behind the bar when I heard a massive bag.

'I went outside and saw the car lying on its roof. The woman was in the car and sitting upside down, bless her.

Locals heard a massive bang last Sunday afternoon on the quite Hawks Road in Kingston - the driver was taken to hospital

The road was almost empty when the accident happened in Surrey - the driver was 'very lucky' to escape virtually unhurt

'I called the emergency services who were there very quickly and helped her out. She didn't say anything and was absolutely fine. I think she was just passing through town, because I'd never seen her before.

'I have no idea how it happened, but there was a car parked in the road with a bump in it, so maybe that's how her car overturned. She is very, very lucky.'

Tim Woolf, 53, of Somerset Avenue, who took the pictures, said: 'I was on my way home and when I got there the police blocked off the road. 

'No one seemed to know how it happened.'

Police, ambulance and firefighters were at the scene quickly, but luckily nobody appeard to be seriously injured in Sunday's mystery accident
