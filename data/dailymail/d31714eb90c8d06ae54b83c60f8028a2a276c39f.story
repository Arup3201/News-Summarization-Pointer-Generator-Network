A rare letter penned by firebrand civil rights protester Malcolm X shortly after he converted to Islam and changed his name is expected to fetch $20,000 when it goes under the hammer.

The six-page note, written in 1950, is one of the earliest known examples of the black power campaigner using the Malcolm X moniker for which he would later become famous.  

In the letter, written from inside jail, he discusses his love for the Boston music scene, and jazz in particular, while grappling with the demons of his 'sinful past'. 

Historic: This letter, written in 1950 by Malcolm X as he was  in jail, discusses his love for jazz music, his 'fear' about returning to that sinful life, and is one of the first times he signed using 'X' instead of his last name

The activist, who was born Malcolm Little, was sent to prison in 1946 for larceny and breaking and entering after a life of petty crime and trouble with the law.

But once in prison he discovered Islam and joined the Lost-Found Nation of Islam, dropping his 'slave' last name and adopting the letter 'X', symbolic of a stolen identity, in its place.

Malcolm X worked in jazz clubs as a youth, but after being jailed he converted to Islam, renounced his former life, and became a civil rights campaigner

The letter, which will be auctioned later this month by RR Auction in Boston, is addressed from prison to an unknown member of the Islamic Nation movement.

In it, Malcolm discusses his love of jazz music, calling the musicians 'wielders of souls', and praising its 'comforting effects'.

However, he also admits that he fears 'the temptations of that life and its memories', adding: 'I steer as far clear from the subject as possible unless I know the fellows are brothers [Muslims].'

In the note he asks his fellow believer to send him a list of all the jazz musicians he knows that follow Islam so he can also write to them from his cell.

At the end of the note, he signs 'As Salaam Alaikum, your Brother, Malcolm X', one of the first known instances where he used his new name.

As Salaam Alaikum is a standard greeting or farewell in Islam, and literally translates as 'peace be upon you', but is usually interpreted as 'hello' or 'goodbye' when used in this context.

After he was paroled from prison in 1952 Malcolm X went on to challenge the mainstream non-violent civil rights movement of Martin Luther King Jr.

Instead he called on his followers to defend themselves from white aggression 'by any means necessary', and advocated black rifle clubs.

His fundamental belief, taken from the teachings of Elijah Muhammad, was that the white man was the devil, and that blacks could never live in harmony with whites.

His autobiography, and numerous public speeches, formed the basis for the black power movement which gained popularity in the 1960s and 1970s.
