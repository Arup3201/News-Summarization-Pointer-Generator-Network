The boss of energy giant E.ON will keep his £500,000 annual bonus despite the firm receiving a record fine for mis-selling to hundreds of thousands of customers.

The German-owned company faces a bill of up to £21million after industry regulator Ofgem discovered ‘large scale mis-selling’ over three years.

Some 465,000 customers lost out after they switched to the supplier based on false promises by aggressive salesmen about how much they could save.

Penalty: E.ON has been made to pay a record £12million to elderly and disabled customers after it mis-sold energy deals for more than three years. The fine was a nominal £1 so that funds did not go to the Treasury

Yesterday, the firm was fined a record
 £12million and told to pay compensation. But in what one MP has called 
an ‘extraordinary’ twist, British chief executive Dr Tony Cocker refused
 to resign – and will only see his annual bonus cut by a quarter.

Despite
 the scandal, the company said last night he will still receive a bonus 
of £510,232, giving him a total pay package worth almost £950,000 for 
last year. He has been chief executive since 2011.

Critics branded the decision ‘unjustifiable and indefensible’.

Those who could be in line for a payout will be contacted in two groups.

The
 first group, 333,000 people receiving the Warm Home Discount, will 
automatically be given £35 each. These are mostly pensioners and the 
disabled.

The second group 
is 465,000 people to whom deals may have been mis-sold, and will also 
include some people on the Warm Home Discount.

They will be sent a letter by E.ON in the near future outlining how to work out whether they are affected and how to claim.

Anyone with concerns, even if they were not in these two groups, should ring the dedicated hotline on 0800 0568497.

 

The
 revelation that Dr Cocker will keep his bonus is particularly 
surprising because Ofgem singled out management for criticism. In its 
report, it said bosses ‘did not do enough to identify issues or act when
 problems were discovered’.

Despite
 this, none of E.ON’s British board directors have lost their jobs, the 
company confirmed. It has also emerged that E.ON’s mis-selling took 
place during a period when it was telling customers it had overhauled 
its sales practices.

In 
January 2012, the company embarked on a six month ‘Reset’ programme to 
improve its relationship with customers. But the process failed to stop 
widespread mis-selling across the group.

Now
 E.ON will have to pay up to £8million to 333,000 elderly and vulnerable
 customers. This is the equivalent of around £35 each.

The
 overall bill includes the cost of administering the compensation 
scheme.

The energy giant will also write to all of the customers who 
could have been mis-sold to, which totals 465,000.

The first letters are
 expected to arrive on Monday and these eligible customers are set to 
receive around £67 per household.

Anyone who signed up to E.ON between 
June 2010 and December 2013 could be entitled to compensation. E.ON said
 bonuses for directors involved in overseeing the sales were cut by up 
to 50 per cent.

E.ON chief executive Tony Cocker: 'It is unacceptable that we may have been unclear with customers'

It added 
that Dr Cocker’s bonus has been reduced by 26 per cent, from £687,200 in
 2012. It is understood some of the staff involved in mis-selling have 
left the firm since but none are at board level.

Yesterday,
 Dr Cocker said that the mis-selling was ‘completely unacceptable’ and 
insisted there was ‘no organised attempt to mislead’. But he refused to 
resign. He added: ‘We are really sorry and want to make it absolutely 
clear that we are putting this right.’

Five
 of Britain’s largest power suppliers – E.ON, EDF, Npower, ScottishPower
 and SSE – have been fined for mis-selling. Only British Gas has not 
been caught up in the scandal. E.ON’s fine is the largest of any of the 
suppliers.

Graham Stringer, a
 Labour MP who sits on the energy select committee, said: ‘It is 
extraordinary that they are still going to give him an enormous bonus.

This is a reward for failure, but it is also more than that. It is 
symptomatic of a culture where people do not accept any responsibility 
for their actions. The people at the top of our energy companies are 
scratching each other’s backs and the consumers pay the price for that.’

His
 Labour colleague on the committee, John Robertson, said: ‘It just 
beggars belief that a company that has ripped people off and been found 
out doing it would give anyone a bonus.’

Shadow
 energy minister Tom Greatrex said: ‘E.ON’s chief executive claims to 
have taken responsibility… but he will still be receiving 75 per cent of
 his bonus.

‘That will strike many as unjustifiable and indefensible.’
