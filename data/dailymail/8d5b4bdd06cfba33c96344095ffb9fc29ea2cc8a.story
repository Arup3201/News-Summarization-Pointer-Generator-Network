Rene Meulensteen has questioned Sir Alex Ferguson over United's failure to win the Premier League in 2012 and their 2009 Champions League Final defeat.

The former first-team coach queried Ferguson's decision to drop Paul Scholes for their defeat at Wigan in a match they lost 1-0 which he believes handed the title to cross-town rivals City three years ago.

And he also queried the Scotsman's starting XI for their clash with Barcelona in Rome in which they were beaten 2-0.

Meulensteen, who enjoyed two spells at Old Trafford before leaving when David Moyes was appointed in 2013, made the comments in an interview with fanzine United We Stand.

Referring to the 2012 title race, which saw City pip their rivals to the post, the Dutchman highlighted the April night match at the DW Stadium as the one in which United blew it.

'That's where we lost the league,' he said. 'The manager thought that Paul Scholes, our key player and the one who could change the rhythm of the game, wasn't right to play two games in a week (United had beaten QPR on the Saturday, a match Scholes scored in) and for that reason he wasn't in the squad and we missed him.'

Meulensteen, who was sacked after a short stint in charge at Fulham following his departure from United, added: 'We couldn't score and we should have had a penalty at the end but Phil Dowd didn't give it.'

The 50-year-old, now with MLS club Philadelphia Union, also revealed what happened on the last day of the 2011-12 season at Sunderland where, following their victory, United were top of the table and set to become champions before Sergio Aguero's late winner for City against QPR snatched the title away from them.

'The manager tapped me on the shoulder and said "well done... we're champions for now".'

'I went into the tunnel to meet Simon Wells, our video man. He said "They (City) have just scored'.

As for the defeat to a Xavi and Andres Iniesta-inspired Barcelona in Italy, Meulensteen again suggested that Ferguson did not get his selection right.

'I thought we had enough quality to deal with them,' he said.

'In hindsight, I think we didn't pick the right team with (Carlos) Tevez, (Dimitar) Berbatov and (Paul) Scholes on the bench.

'Three massive players who could have put more authority in the game, especially as a few players underperformed.'
