A terminally ill woman who was granted 
the right to die after a court battle with her own parents before having a 
last-minute change of heart, has died.

Grace Sung Eun Lee, a former Manhattan bank 
manager, was stricken with a brain tumor and fought her extremely religious family for the right to die back in October.

After winning the legal battle, she apparently had a change of heart and signed a 
document allowing her father to make decisions about 
her healthcare, and was kept alive.

But on Sunday, Grace was pronounced dead shortly after her ventilator reportedly malfunctioned.

A statement on the 'Save Grace SungEun Lee' Facebook page on Monday read simply: 'Grace is now with the Lord. Thank you for all your prayers and sticking with us until now.'

Her brother Danny Lee told the New York Daily News: 'We believe that God took her. We don’t blame anyone.'

Miss Lee was paralyzed from the neck down due to the tumor on her brain stem.

She could not talk because of the tumor, but communicated by spelling out words by blinking.

Danny Lee told the paper that his sister's last words included 'God,' 'heaven' and 'love mom and dad.'

Her parents, who belong to a Korean 
Christian church in Queens, believed that allowing her daughter to 
choose death over life was a sin, after she told  them: 'I want to die.'

A judge at the state appeals court sided with Miss Lee after the rift with her parents led to an agonizing legal battle for the family.

But 24 hours later, she signed over her decision-making abilities to her father, Rev Manho Lee, of the Antioch Missionary Church in Flushing.

He believed that if she removes her 
breathing tube she will have committed suicide, which he regarded as a 
sin.

His congregation flocked behind him to pray for Ms Lee and tell her of God's plans for her life.

The sin of suicide, they said, would condemn their daughter's soul to hell.

The
difference in beliefs led to an emergency end-of-life hearing at the 
hospital, with the two sides bitterly reaffirming their respective 
stances.

Speaking on behalf of Ms Lee, Dr Dana
Lustbader testified that the patient ‘consistently asks that her 
breathing tube be removed.’

However,
Rev Lee and his wife argued that their daughter is heavily medicated, 
and is not lucid enough to make the life-or-death decision.

Doctors said that her medications, 
including morphine and an anti-anxiety medication, are not strong enough
to cloud her judgment.

Ms
Lee’s troubles began last year. Before her illness, she worked as a 
manager for Bank of America, living and working in Manhattan.

She was also training for the famous New York City marathon.

She
had emigrated with her parents from Seoul, South Korea, the Daily News 
reported. But Ms Lee was devastated when she was diagnosed with a tumour
in her brain stem.

Though 
she received chemotherapy and radiation, the treatments did not 
successfully target the tumour, and last month, she had a seizure that 
eventually left her paralysed. 

Miss Lee had apparently talked to nurses at North Shore about removing the tubes, but her parents interceded.
