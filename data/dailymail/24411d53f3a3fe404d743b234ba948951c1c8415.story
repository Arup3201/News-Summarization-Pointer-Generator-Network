With period four-poster beds, stone wash basins, antique potion bottles and vintage cauldrons in its rooms, London hotel The Georgian House's Wizard Chambers have everything a die-hard Harry Potter could want. 

The 163-year-old property, near Victoria Station, has unveiled its Hogwarts-themed bedrooms, designed to resemble the fictional wizard's living quarters.

The rooms come complete with battered trunks, spell books and even study tables. 

Something wicked this way comes: The Georgian House has two Wizard Chamber rooms for guests 

Hotel guests can take advantage of the Harry Potter Tour Package which includes a visit to the Warner Bros studio, where all of the movies were filmed

Prices start at £249 a night in the smaller Wizard Chambers, which sleeps three people. The larger room, which sleeps five, costs £363 a night.

The hotel offers guests a Harry Potter Tour Package, which includes accommodation, a Muggle walking tour of central London landmarks from the film and a trip to the Warner Bros Studio for The Making of Harry Potter Tour. 

Room rates without the extras cost £209 a night for two. 

'The rooms are initially inspired by the Harry Potter films; the draped four-poster beds, and the battered trunks for instance,' Serena von der Heyde, partner at The Georgian House, told MailOnline. 

'But we really wanted to create a magical experience, so there are lots of original and creative touches, like a wand painted into the hand of a portrait of the Mona Lisa for example.  

Wizard details: The Chambers are decorated with a study table and chair as well as a spell book

The Georgian House was built in 1851 and is still run by the descendants of the original owners

Double, double, toil and trouble: Magical room decor to get guests in the mood for a spellbinding stay

'The initial idea was to find something to really appeal to children.'

An independent bed and breakfast, The Georgian House is located in Victoria and was built in 1851. The hotel is still run by the descendants of the original owners.

As well as the Hogwarts themed rooms, the four-star property also offers Victoria Classic and Belgravia Boutique rooms.
