It took four officers and two gunshot wounds to restrain a 28-year-old U.S. soldier on a drunken rampage through a German hospital Thursday.

The soldier, who has not been identified, was brought into the Clinic of Grosshadern emergency room with a head wound at an Oktoberfest party.

Upon waking up, he proceeded to tear a red fire extinguisher off the wall, wave it around, and threaten the patients along with the nurses and doctors trying to treat him.

The New York Daily News reports the soldier even gave one 89-year-old patient a fat lip as he swung the fire extinguisher.

The incident was originally reported by German newspaper Abendzeitung.

The soldier, who had been stationed at the U.S. Army Garrison Grafenwoehr, was finally pacified when four Bavarian police officers were called to the scene.

Far from going quietly, he ignored commands to lower the extinguisher in both German and English and began attacking the officers.

Before he was able to hit them with his make-shift weapon, one officer was able to shoot him in the leg.

He had to be shot twice before he dropped the extinguisher and gave in to the authorities.

It is considered extremely rare for German police to use their guns, and the Bavarian State Office of Criminal Investigation is reportedly looking into the incident.

The injuries should not be life-threatening, NBC News reports.

The soldier faces a potential assault charge.

He had recently returned from a tour of duty in Afghanistan.
