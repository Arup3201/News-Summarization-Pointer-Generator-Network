A man hailed a hero after saving his wife’s life after her heart stopped for nearly an hour was secretly betraying her by looting the homes of her parents and grandmother.

Michael Corke, 32, was given a 'super dad' award by ITV’s Daybreak after performing CPR on his wife Lisa when she collapsed at home.

Lisa's heart stopped for 55 minutes but she was kept alive by Corke who was talked through the live-saving first aid treatment by an emergency call handler.

Fake: Michael Corke was painted out to be a perfect husband after juggling self-employment, raising two children and caring for his wife after he saved her life - but he was secretly stealing from his in-laws

Grateful Lisa wrote to Daybreak praising her husband for juggling life as a self-employed carpenter and caring for daughters Ellie, four, and baby Amelie, one, during her recovery.

But at the same time hard-up Corke was stealing cash and jewellery from his parents-in-law and Lisa’s grandmother Joan Gillham, 79.

A month after his wife’s collapse he raided Mrs Gillham’s bungalow in Minster, Kent, while she was on holiday in Spain.

She returned to find £150 in cash, jewellery and china from 1907 ocean liner RMS Mauretania missing.

The loot was found in a shed when Lisa’s father, mortgage consultant Alex Mitchell, 55, became suspicious.

Jailed: Corke gladly accepted the 'Super dad' ITV award after his wife Lisa wrote in to praise him

Betrayed: The judge at Maidstone Crown Court said Corke had betrayed his wife and family

He also found stolen and pawned jewellery, including a 9ct gold ring, taken from his family two months after the burglary on Mrs Gillham.

Maidstone Crown Court heard that an insurance claim for the missing property totalled £13,000.

Corke admitted theft and was jailed for four years by Judge Charles Byers who told him he had 'betrayed' his family.

He said: 'These were mean offences.

'You were trusted in homes of those people who treated you as a third grandson. You betrayed that trust.'

Jailed: Corke now faces four years in jail for betraying his family and stealing from his in-laws. His wife Lisa has divorced him

The court heard that Lisa has since divorced Corke, of Minster, Kent.

Outside court her mother Tracy Mitchell, 55, said: 'Right to the bitter end he has shown no remorse whatsoever to my family. It was absolutely devastating.'

Medics later discovered Lisa had a hereditary heart condition called Long QT where her heart can stop if she becomes over-excited.

The same condition was responsible for claiming the life of her grandfather who died laughing at an episode of The Goodies in 1975.
