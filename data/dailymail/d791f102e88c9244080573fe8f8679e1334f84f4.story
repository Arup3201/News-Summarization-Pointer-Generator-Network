An Elmo character looking for tourists to pose for pictures with in Times Square instead had an unpleasant run-in with police that ended in handcuffs.

Rosa Sanchez, 36, from Clifton, New Jersey, was taken into custody Tuesday for allegedly demanding tips in an aggressive manner from passersby while dressed as Elmo.

Arresting officers who were part of an undercover sting operation restrained the woman's hands behind her back and took a picture of her fuzzy red costume with the caption: 'just another day in Midtown south. Elmo arrested in Times Square.'

Ms Sanchez was then taken to Midtown South Police Precinct to be charged for aggressive solicitation.

The New York Post reported that the 36-year-old was arrested at around 3.30pm after 10 police officers posing as tourists took pictures with her.

Sanchez allegedly became irate when one of the plainclothes cops gave her a small tip.

Tuesday’s arrest comes amid an ongoing crackdown dubbed Operation Sesame Street targeting costumed panhandlers.

Shady characters: The NYPD has been cracking down on costumed characters prowling the streets of Manhattan looking for tips

Most famously, a man named Daniel Sandler was arrested in 2012 for spewing anti-Semitic slurs while dressed as Elmo in Midtown Manhattan.

As recently as July, a man dressed as Spider-Man was charged with punching a police officer who intervened in a tipping dispute with a tourist.

Three more men dressed as Spider-Man, Iron Man and Elmo were arrested that same weekend and charged with disorderly conduct for obstructing pedestrian traffic.

Last month, police spent hours handing out bright red fliers in Times Square warning tourists that photos with costumed characters are free, and tipping is optional.

Some of the mostly Spanish-speaking immigrants who wear the giant costumes lamented that the police crackdown has left them with far less to feed their families.

The City Council is currently working on a bill to require licensing for characters in the hopes of putting ‘bad players’ out of business.
