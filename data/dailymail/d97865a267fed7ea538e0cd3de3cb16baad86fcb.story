A Palestinian man was arrested today in connection with the murders of three Israeli teenagers as warplanes hammered 10 targets in Gaza.

Soldiers swooped on a home just after midnight in the West Bank city of Hebron, where Israeli forces have concentrated their search for the killers.

The arrest came after protests over the apparent revenge killing of a Palestinian teenager spread yesterday from Jerusalem to Arab towns in northern Israel.

An American teenager - the cousin of the murdered Palestinian boy - who was beaten and detained by police during the protests in east Jerusalem was today brought before an Israeli court.

Overnight, Israeli airstrikes targeted what the Israelis claimed were rocket launchers and a weapons workshop in the Gaza Strip, after 29 rockets and mortars were fired into Israeli territory.

Relations between Israel and Palestine have been tense since Eyal Yifrach, 19, and 16-year-olds Gilad Shaar and Naftali Frenkel were abducted on June 12, leading to a massive Israeli military operation in Palestinian areas.

They were later found dead in a shallow grave, a discovery quickly followed by the the apparent revenge killing of a Palestinian boy, Mohammed Abu Khdeir, who was snatched from his home in East Jerusalem.

His burned body was found in a forest. Palestinian officials said a post-mortem indicated the 16-year old had been burned alive.

Israeli police say they are still investigating the killing of Mohammed Abu Khdeir, but Palestinians say Israeli extremists murdered him to avenge the deaths of the three Israelis.

The man arrested in connection with the murder of the Jewish teenagers was identified by his family as Hossam Dufesh, the Associated Press reports.

His arrest came as violence spread from Jerusalem to Arab communities across northern Israel, with with hundreds of people throwing rocks and fire bombs at police who responded with tear gas and stun grenades.

Police spokeswoman Luba Samri said police had arrested 22 Israeli Arabs. Unlike Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israeli Arabs hold citizenship rights, but still face discrimination from the 'Jewish State'.

Even so, violent riots like those that occurred yesterday are rare. Clashes had mostly subsided by early this morning, but the situation remained tense.Â

Police today asked a Jerusalem court to extend the detention of 15-year-old U.S. citizen Tariq Abu Khdeir, who was badly beaten by police during the clashes. He is the cousin of murdered Palestinian teenager Mohammed Abu Khdeir.

His parents say their son, who goes to school in Florida, was the last person with Mohammed shortly before he was snatched. They said Tariq left Mohammed to eat before the Ramadan fast began at dawn Wednesday, and Mohammed was seized shortly afterward.

Police said Tariq Abu Khdeir resisted arrest, attacked officers, and was captured with a slingshot for lobbing stones.

Abu Khdeir's face was masked in a keffiyeh, an Arab headscarf that some Palestinian protesters wore during the clashes to conceal their identity, police added.

He was detained along with six other protesters, police said, including some armed with knives, adding that several officers were hurt in that specific protest, one of many that day.

Amateur video of what Tariq's father Salah said was the beating aired on a local television station, and he said he could recognize his son from his clothing.

Pictures of the boy taken after his arrest showed his face badly swollen.

The U.S. State Department said it was 'profoundly troubled' by reports of his beating and demanded an investigation. Israel's Justice Ministry quickly launched a formal investigation.
