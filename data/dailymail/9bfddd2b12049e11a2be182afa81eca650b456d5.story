An insurance worker has been docked 15 days' salary after spending more than 40 hours looking at Facebook over the summer.

The unnamed woman spent a staggering 47 hours 'wasting time' on the internet when she was supposed to be working for Försäkringskassan in Gävle, central Sweden.

She used the majority of the time to look at Facebook - with the remaining hours spent on hundreds of blogs, shopping sites and weight-loss pages.

She has now lost half of her month's pay after her bosses discovered her web activities, according to The Local.

The insurance agency ruled she had been 'disloyal to the employer' by being 'inactive' instead of helping customers during both paid overtime and scheduled work over the summer

The woman is just one of several Försäkringskassan employees to have faced disciplinary action for browsing the internet while at work. 

In another case, an employee spent around 50 hours during just one month visiting 350 websites when she was supposed to be working.

And one worker was 'inactive' in the work
 system 
for 69 of her 474 clocked hours, as well as visiting 112 websites not 
related to work and leaving the office during working hours.

It is not the first time an employee has been fired after being caught using Facebook in the workplace.

Last year, a DVLA worker was sacked after accessing the social networking site while working - even though there was no suggestion he had criticised his employers on there.

The agency was labelled 'draconian' by online critics following the dismissal, which was disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act.
