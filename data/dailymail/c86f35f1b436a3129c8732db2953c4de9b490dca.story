The Argentinian papers were full of praise for their national team and goal scorer Lionel Messi on Monday morning despite just scraping past Bosnia-Herzegovina.  

Messi scored only his second goal in nine World Cup games as El Dia celebrate Argentina's three points 'without playing at their level'.

The La Plata newspaper leads with an image of the Barcelona star as they hail Alejandro Sabella's side for being 'on the right path' to World Cup glory.

Elsewhere, Diario Uno report that Argentina can 'breathe' again as star man Messi's World Cup goal drought is over.

The 26-year-old scored a stunning effort in the 65th minute after a neat one-two with Argentina substitute Gonzalo Higuain allowed Messi to curl in his shot from the edge of Bosnia's penalty area.

Rio Negro believe the World Cup has truly 'started with Leo' and praise Sabella for his half-time change of system which allowed Argentina to get the better of their Group F opponents.
