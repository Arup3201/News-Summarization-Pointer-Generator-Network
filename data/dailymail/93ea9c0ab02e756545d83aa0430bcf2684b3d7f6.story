An ex-Playboy model says her mother-of-two friend lost a custody battle over her children because female judges 'are the girls in high school who never got that guy' and want 'vicious payback' over good-looking women.

Bridget Marks, 48, believes there is a lot of 'bias' in the courts against 'pretty women who marry or are involved with wealthy men'. 

She spoke out after her friend Lisa Mehos, 39, lost her two children, aged four and six, in a bitter custody battle with her financier husband Manuel Mehos last year. 

'Payback': Former Playboy model Bridget Marks, 48, (left) says there is a lot of 'bias' in the courts against 'pretty women who marry or are involved with wealthy men'. She spoke out after her friend Lisa Mehos (right) lost custody of her two children following a bitter custody battle with her financier husband 

The judge said she 'deliberately' lied about her pill and alcohol use during the hearings which was a key factor in coming to her decision.

Mrs Mehos is now appealing the decision, with her attorney's claiming she has been sober for more than three years and has admitted making mistakes in the past. 

The appeals court will issue a ruling in the coming months. 

Mrs Marks similarly lost a custody battle over her twin five-year-old daughters in 2004 when a female judge determined that she coached her children to say their father sexually abused them.

Speaking to the New York Post outside a Manhattan court of appeals last week, she said: 'You walk in and you've got the blown-out hair, the nice clothes, the pretty children and the fairy book, and that makes them angry. 

'In a way, it becomes a vicious payback for the guy they didn't get in high school. I pray the justices read the record carefully and see this is a good mother.'

According to The Post, Mrs Meho's lawyer Tom Shanahan told the appeals panel that Mrs Mehos' two children are effectively being raise by nannies while their father runs Green Bank in Houston. 

Eleanor Alter, the lawyer for Mr Mehos, reportledy said her client is a 'loving and capable and honest person' compared to his ex-wife, whose life is 'chaos on every level.'

Battle: Her ex-husband Manuel, pictured, had argued that her abortion after their divorce showed her up as a hypocrite when she said she wanted to be with her children on Easter Sunday. Justice Lori Sattler (right) ruled in March 2014 that the drugs use endangered her children, citing one example from 2012 where she passed out and her son, then two, ran around without pants or a diaper

Response: Mrs Marks, who lost her children in a custody battle 10 years ago, claimed that if you walk into a court looking pretty with your 'hair blown out', it makes a female judge 'angry'

Mrs Mehos divorced her banker Manuel, or 'Manny' in 2011, and claimed she started taking antidepressants after the split.

But subpoenaed records showed she had actually been reliant on them since she married her husband in 2006, according to the court ruling seen by the New York Daily News.

It revealed that she has been prescribed drugs, including Xanax and Valium, by 28 different doctors since 2008 

She would allegedly even pick up prescriptions from two different doctors on the same day.

Justice Lori Sattler ruled in March 2014 that the drugs use endangered her children, citing one example from 2012 where she passed out and her son, then two, ran around without pants or a diaper.

She also admitted to having sex with a friend a year after her marriage to Mehos, then 59, came to an end. The fling resulted in her being pregnant and having an abortion.

Fabrication: The judge said Mrs Mehos lied about her problems with pills during the hearings which was a key factor in coming to her decision

Speaking to the New York Post in 2014, a devastated Mrs Mehos said:  'I’m divorced. I’m not Mother Teresa! I feel like I’ve been beaten up and raped. I had sex with someone I knew for 20 years, and I’m somehow this terrible, bad parent!'

She now only sees her children on Mondays and alternate weekends.

'It just breaks my heart. They're so confused,' she said.

In 2013 Mr Mehos was arrested and accused of battering his wife but charges were later dropped due to insufficient evidence after he claimed her black eye was from a Botox injection.
