Manchester United midfielder Marouane Fellaini is set for an extended spell on the sidelines.

The £27.5million man is believed to have suffered an injury in training and was photographed hobbling on crutches and wearing a protective boot.

Sportsmail understands that the early prognosis is that the Belgium star has not broken his ankle but there are fears in his native land that he has suffered ankle ligament damage. Fellaini is awaiting the result of further scans.

Off colour: The Belgian endured a miserable first season at Old Trafford under David Moyes

Fellaini has endured a traumatic 12 months at Old Trafford since signing from Everton on deadline day last summer.

He is still to score a competitive goal and made only 16 starts amid poor form and injury problems in his first campaign at the club.

It is understood that new manager Louis van Gaal signalled his intention to sell Fellaini at the beginning of the summer but United's attempts to move the player may be doomed following this latest set-back.

Replacement: Fellaini came on for Ander Herrera during United's 2-1 defeat by Swansea

Napoli are interested in Fellaini but they are looking to take him on loan, rather than the permanent deal that United are hoping for. 

With Michael Carrick ruled out until the beginning of October, Van Gaal has only Ander Herrera, Darren Fletcher and Tom Cleverley to choose from in central midfield, so he is keen to find a high-quality recruit before the transfer window closes.

United continue to deny they have any interest in Arturo Vidal of Juventus, but Ajax’s Daley Blind — who can operate at left back or in holding midfield — remains a target and Roma’s Kevin Strootman could be on the agenda in January.

He joins a host of United players on the injury list — Carrick, Jonny Evans, Danny Welbeck, Tom Cleverley, Luke Shaw and Antonio Valencia all missed the opening day defeat by Swansea.

Robin van Persie, however, is edging closer to a return and could yet be involved at Sunderland on Sunday.

Cold: The 26-year-old has also become the latest United star to take part of the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge

Manchester United declined to comment on the midfielder's injury. 

The 26-year-old has also become the latest United star to take part of the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge after being nominated by Belgian team-mate Christian Benteke.

Interestingly, the former Everton man decided to dare his former boss David Moyes to take the on the chilly challenge.

The out-of-work manager now has 24 hours to take on the challenge himself.

Fellaini tweeted: 'Thanks for the icebucketchallenge @landry.mulemo @andowlovee @christianbenteke25 ...Now i nominate @sylv.15 #moyes'.
