Cheryl Fernandez-Versini is widely considered to be one of the world's most beautiful women. 

The singer and X Factor judge is the only Brit to win FHM's Sexiest Women twice and has appeared in the magazine's rankings 12 times since shooting to fame in 2003. 

The 31-year-old has now revealed some from the beauty regime that maintains her famous face and it is refreshingly down-to-earth.

Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has listed the details of her beauty regime - they include never allowing others to pluck her eyebrows and doing her own make-up for events 

Her daily habits, which include applying her own make-up for events and never allowing beauticians to touch her eyebrows, make her X-Factor colleague Simon Cowell look as high-maintenance as Mariah Carey.

Speaking to the new edition of HELLO! Fashion Monthly, Cheryl said: 'I prefer to apply my own makeup. 

'I've lived with this face for 31 years, so I know it better than anybody! 

'I've picked up so many great tips over the years working with some of the world's best makeup artists.'

'I know they say not to wear red lipstick and heavily made-up eyes, but I love statement eyes, so I say just go with it. 

Despite being advised against a heavy and and red lip, Cheryl maintains it is one of her favourite make-up styles 

'I love lots of lashes, liner and red lipstick, it feels very grown up and glamorous.'

And the star reveals that after a string of disasters, she refuses to let anyone else try and tame her bushy brows.  

She said: 'I don't let anyone touch my eyebrows. 

I've had threading and waxing disasters – I don't trust anyone with my brows, so I do my own. 

I do it as soon as I get out of the shower so it's less painful as I have such thick ones.'

Cheryl is from the Kim Kardashian school of contouring - using dark eye shadow to create cheekbones 

Cheryl also revealed that she is a fan of the Kim Kardashian school of heavy contouring to make her bone structure look more impressive. 

She said: 'I use eye shadow to contour my cheekbones. A matte taupe eye shadow is the best product to create cheekbones. 

'My makeup artist Lisa Laudat taught me that tip years ago when I was in Girls Aloud.'
