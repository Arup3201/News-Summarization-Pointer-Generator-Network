Manchester City have publicly wished Sergio Aguero a happy birthday following the furore caused by Yaya Toure about his importance to the club.

Toure's agent claimed that the Premier League champions' failure to celebrate his birthday showed that a lack of respect and claimed the midfielder was very upset.

Now, City have sent Aguero a message from their official Twitter account which reads: 'Feliz cumpleaños Sergio! Happy birthday, Sergio! Join us in wishing @aguerosergiokun a very happy 26th today!'

Toure's future at City was thrown into doubt when he backed claims from his agent Dimitri Seluk that he was upset by City's treatment of him.

Seluk said: 'There is a big possibility Yaya will leave this summer. He is very upset. What happened at his birthday means the club don't care about him. It was proof.

'They can say whatever they want, "Oh we like him but we forgot". Forgot? About Yaya? The player who helped you to be two-time Premier League champions? The guy who helped you win the FA Cup and League Cup?

'In a normal team, his team-mates and club would at least give him good wishes. But when you win the title and two days later you have a big party to celebrate the title and nobody comes to Yaya to say happy birthday, what more do you want?

'If a player like Yaya went to Liverpool and they won the league for the first time in 24 years, Yaya would be a god in Liverpool.'

It later emerged that City had celebrated Toure's birthday by presenting him with a cake on a flight to Abu Dhabi at the end of the season.

Toure, who scored 20 Premier League goals last season, was later linked to Paris Saint-Germain but has played down speculation about a transfer.

Aguero is currently preparing for the World Cup with his Argentina international team-mates including Lionel Messi and Gonzalo Higuain.

The former Atletico Madrid man has been linked with a transfer to Barcelona this summer after his father reportedly told Spanish newspaper AS: 'He would love to go to Barcelona but Manchester City will make it impossible (for Aguero to go).'
