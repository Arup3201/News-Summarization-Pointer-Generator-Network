Winner: Jo Wheatley, who won the Great British Bake Off, told producers of the show that her husband was in jail

Jo Wheatley may have deserved her victory in this year’s Great British Bake Off but she was, in many ways, a most unlikely winner.

Her cupcakes were deemed ‘sublime’ and her limoncello and white chocolate croquembouche ‘outstandingly delicious’, but such was Jo’s timid, unassuming nature that no one thought she would battle through to the final of the TV cooking show, let alone win it.

Perhaps least of all  the executives at the BBC. While four-and-a- half million viewers cheered on the 42-year-old mother of three who ‘just wanted to do something for myself’, The Mail on Sunday can reveal that the show’s producers were presented with a small problem.

For the winner of The Great British Bake Off – a celebration of all things homely and innocent – is married to a man who is in prison for his part in a £60 million money-laundering operation.

On April 20, 2010, at Southwark Crown Court, Richard Wheatley, 44, was sentenced to seven years after earlier pleading guilty to conspiracy with others to conceal, convert and transfer proceeds of crime.

The money, alleged to have come from drug trafficking, was laundered through a money exchange.

So Jo’s victory left the BBC with something of a dilemma. The Great British Bake Off was the surprise hit of the summer and ordinarily the  winner would be wheeled out for any number of interviews to promote it.

One Corporation insider told The Mail on Sunday: ‘This was the second series and it has really taken off. The BBC is delighted.

‘The big thing now is branded television – programmes such as Top Gear and Strictly Come Dancing which have a clear identity and lots of associated merchandise.

‘The Great British Bake Off is perfect for the BBC. They’re already planning series three. The ratings have been great and the cookery book that goes with the show went to number one in the non-fiction chart.’

But nearly three weeks after the final on October 4, Jo has been conspicuous by her absence. So was her husband throughout the series. In pre-recorded segments filmed at the family’s home in Essex, there  was no mention of Mr Wheatley.

The couple’s three sons – Billy, 24, Jesse, 21, and Dylan, 16 – were filmed playing cricket in the garden and were interviewed around the scrubbed pine kitchen table.

They also attended the garden party, celebrating the final, held in the grounds of Valentines Mansion and Gardens in Ilford, Essex, where the Bake Off was filmed. 

For Jo – a sweet, shy woman – it must have been enormously difficult knowing that her husband was in prison while she was on TV in front of millions, baking Battenberg cakes.

And nor has it become any easier now the series is over. She hasn’t given any interviews, just one cookery demonstration in which she showed  a writer how to make her favourite cookies.

Jo made a fleeting reference to her husband – the childhood sweetheart she married when she was 17 – admitting that he had been jailed for ‘fraud’ 18 months ago but she refused to go into any details.

She said the TV show’s judges, Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood, did not know about Wheatley’s conviction until after the final, but that she had been ‘honest with the producers from the start’.

The show is made for the BBC by Love Productions, an independent company which also makes Famous, Rich And Homeless for BBC1. 

Jo said: ‘I didn’t want it to define  me. I didn’t want to use it as some  X Factor-style sob story.’ She then went on to reveal the secrets of her ‘cupcake cupboard’, an Aladdin’s cave of edible glitter and hundreds and thousands.

This is the side of Jo that made her such a popular contestant. Engagingly girly, she didn’t show the same ruthlessness as other contestants. Like her cakes, she was pretty and delicate and often wreathed in pink. 

While waiting for the results of each task, she would suck her index finger like a little girl and dissolve into tears at the merest hint she had fallen short of Berry’s exacting standards. 

Which is what makes her husband’s story all the more surprising. A professional gambler, Wheatley is known as The Bear on the international poker circuit.

It’s not hard to  see why, with his barrel chest and grizzled beard. Wheatley has enjoyed modest success, earning approximately £42,000 since 2006.

His biggest win was £26,250 for  coming first in the £500 No Limit Hold’em tournament held at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London in 2008.

Although it’s a substantial amount, it is certainly not enough to fund his glamorous lifestyle.

On his Twitter account, last updated on May 3, 2010, Wheatley mentioned he had once played poker in the French resort of Deauville and spent a week gambling in Monaco, which he combined with a short stay at the exclusive Carlton Hotel in Cannes. 

On December 30, 2009, he said he would be staying at The Dorchester in London for the next few days.

During his stay, he enjoyed a dinner at the hotel’s expensive Chinese restaurant, China Tang, a favourite haunt of celebrities and bankers. 

On New Year’s Eve he was at The Ivy, but did very little on New Year’s Day. ‘I have been in bed all day,’ he tweeted. ‘Thinking about getting up for dinner, maybe?’

It’s a far cry from the way Bake Off presents the Wheatleys’ home life: a chaotic but cosy domestic scene of muddy trainers and the endless piles of washing that come with three boys, all of whom like to give their mother marks out of ten for the family dinner, purposely teasing her with unfairly low scores.

Jo clearly devoted her life to being a mother and a home-maker, but it would appear that Wheatley had other ambitions. Little is known about his trial, which began on February 28, 2010, and was not reported. Even his fellow poker players were unaware of his crime.

On April 5 that year, Wheatley tweeted a player about a tournament, writing: ‘Wish I could have been there but mislaid my passport!’ In fact, he was on remand waiting to be sentenced.

In another tweet, on April 28,  he messaged writer and poker player  Victoria Coren, congratulating her on her performance during the European Poker Tour’s Grand Final in Monte Carlo. Eight days earlier he had been jailed by Judge Gregory Stone QC.

There were four co-defendants in the case, all at least ten years younger than Wheatley. Charith Abeysinghe, 28, a Sri Lankan film director, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal, was jailed for seven years.

Kasun Maddumage, 26, who pleaded guilty to the same offence, was jailed for 18 months. Madhawa Arachchi, 34, and 30-year-old Thurkka Nanisagran denied conspiracy to steal. It is not known what happened to them.

They seem strange company for Wheatley to keep, a man who lists golf and urban art as his hobbies  on his professional poker player profile. He also says his favourite movie is McVicar. 

The 1980 British drama, starring Roger Daltrey, dramatised the life of John McVicar, the Sixties armed robber-turned-writer who Scotland Yard named as Public Enemy No  1. The film told the story of his  criminal exploits and his eventual rehabilitation.

Whether Wheatley will follow a similar path remains to be seen but of one thing he can be sure. In her only interview, when asked if she would stand by him, Jo was unequivocal. ‘Of course,’ she said. ‘I’ve known him since I was 15 and I  love him.’

Nevertheless, Wheatley will be returning to a very different wife when he finishes his sentence which, Jo says, could be in two years.

Having devoted her life to her sons, whom she calls her proudest achievements, Jo went on The Great British Bake Off to do something for herself.

And as the winner she can now carve out a fulfilling career.Last year’s victor, Edd Kimber, went on to work with Raymond Blanc and has just released a bestselling book, The Boy Who Bakes. 

Jo already has a popular blog – Jo’s Blue Aga – and has set up a series of cookery workshops. Last Friday she appeared on the BBC’s One Show showing a food critic how to bake scones.

A book deal is in the offing.

It is a richly deserved success, particularly after the trials of the past 18 months which she admits have been ‘devastating’. 

And it must be an enormous relief to know Jo can provide the means to support her family. Her husband must be very proud of her. Last night Jo’s representative declined to comment on Wheatley’s conviction. 

Wheatley’s 69-year-old father,  Robert, lives in a Twenties semi-detached cottage in south-west Essex.

Last night he was away on business. Wheatley’s stepmother, Karen, a pretty 44-year-old blonde, said: ‘I’m sorry, I don’t think I can say anything.’

A BBC spokesman said: ‘Joanne’s husband’s background bears no relevance to the programme. She does not have a criminal conviction and was selected in the same way as the other contributors who appeared. She is a talented baker and those talents have been recognised.’
