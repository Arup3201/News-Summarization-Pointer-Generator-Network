The Belgian Deputy Prime Minister has been accused of racism after blacking up his face during a charity event in Brussels.

Foreign Minister Didier Reynders painted his face and dressed up as an '19th century African nobleman' as he joined charity organisation Les Noirauds (The Blacks) for a fundraising rally.

The 56-year-old liberal politician later posted pictures of himself during the event on social media, captioned: 'The singing blacks'.

Reynders has since faced criticism from minority organisations and prominent Belgians of African descent, who have said the minister's behaviour was 'unacceptable'. 

Wouter Van Bellingen, the director of Minority Forum, called the Deputy PM's actions 'deplorable', adding that Belgium still lacks a national anti-racism plan, despite making a commitment to devise one 14 years ago.

Peter Bouckaert, from Human Rights Watch, tweeted: 'Belgium FM @Dreynders I have question: will u wear #blackface outfit 2 next meeting with African leaders? Shame on you!'. 

Twitter user Olivier Wah added: 'Considering what Belgium did in The Congo, this sucks to the max, right? No shame?' 

'In other civilised countries his political career wouldn't
survive this, but in Belgium he just continues,' said
Nigerian-born author Chika Unigwe.

Under fire: Reynders has been criticised by minority organisations and prominent Belgians of African descent, who have called his actions 'unacceptable'

Other users of the microblogging site called the Foreign Minister's actions 'racist' and 'disgusting'.  

Les Noirauds is an organisation under royal patronage founded in 1876, which collects money for children's charities. 

Members of Les Noirauds blacken their faces and dress in white top hats, ruffled collars, bright green trousers and stockings, emulating what they call #19th century African noblemen'.

The group, accompanied by Reynders, appeared during a charity rally in Brussels last Saturday accompanied by a band dubbed the 'Conservatoire Africain' (African conservatory). 

Despite the criticism on Twitter, very little response has come from withing the Belgian political sphere, with even the left-leaning Green Party saying Les Noirauds were innocuous folklore.

Reynders, who on his website stresses the importance of
Central Africa in Belgium's foreign policy, posted pictures of
himself with blackened face on his blog and Twitter, describing
how he collected funds for children's charities. 

The Democratic Republic
of Congo, is the largest country in central Africa and was a Belgian colony until 1960.

Millions of Congolese
are estimated to have died and the country was decimated in the
late 19th and early 20th centuries when Belgian King Leopold II
ran Congo as his personal fiefdom.
