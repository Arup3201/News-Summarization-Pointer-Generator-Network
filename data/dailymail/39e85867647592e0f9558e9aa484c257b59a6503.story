Older people have been warned about the dangers of excessive drinking after figures showed the number suffering alcohol-related mental-health problems has rocketed by 150 per cent in a decade.

The latest research on the  over-60s, published today, raises  concerns that the baby-boomer generation is failing to acknowledge the damaging effects of long-term drinking.

A new study found alcohol is causing a rise in the numbers diagnosed with dementia. Experts say the figures confirm an epidemic of late-onset drinking during retirement and following bereavement.

And it appears the wealthiest are drinking the most. In London,  the greatest number of hospital admissions are in some of the most affluent areas, including Kensington and Islington.

Eric Appleby, chief executive  of Alcohol Concern, said those born between 1947 and 1964 had grown up with a more liberal approach to alcohol.

He added: ‘This is a wake-up call – we’re drinking too much, too often and we’re paying the price for this with our mental and physical well-being.’

The new study was carried out by Dr Tony Rao, a consultant psychiatrist at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, and examined trends in hospital admissions in England for those aged between 60 and 74.

He found the number of admissions for people with behavioural and mental disorders linked to alcohol use had gone from 3,247 in 2002 to 8,120 in 2012 – a 150 per cent rise.

The cost of admissions linked to heavy drinking among 55 to 74-year-olds last year was more than £825 million, according to Alcohol Concern. That figure is ten times the cost of treating younger people.
