The annals of fishing folklore full of tales of the big catch that got away.

But for one hapless fisherman a minor technicality meant his genuine claim to catching a record-breaking rainbow trout slipped from his clutches.

Mark Clemishire was casting his line across Lake Taneycomo, in Missouri, when he hooked a monster fish christened 'Troutzilla'.

'It was just a submarine of a fish. I 
was running after him through the water, stumbling over rocks trying to 
keep him close. I started screaming ‘big fish! big fish!’ to the other 
guys fishing, hoping they’d move when we came through,' he told News-Leader.com.

It took more than 20 minutes to tire the giant fish enough to land it.

Out of the water, Mr Clemishire, of Skiatook, Oklahoma, measured his catch as 31 inches long, 23 inches around with a back three inches thick.

Bait: This tiny lure manages to hook the biggest fish ever caught in Missouri

They estimated the fish's weight to be
20lbs, 8oz - trouncing the previous Missouri record rainbow of 18lbs 
1oz caught in 2004 at Roaring River State Park.

But because Clemishire’s Troutzilla was not weighed on a certified scale, he can only claim bragging rights about having caught a potential record.

A phlegmatic Mr Clemishire does not mind not being able to officially claim his place in the record books.

He is more than happy to know he let the prime specimen go back into the wild unharmed and free to be caught again by another lucky angler.
