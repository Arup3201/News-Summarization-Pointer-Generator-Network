A man who was released from prison after spending 26 years on death row is rebuilding his life with the help of an Amazon wishlist - donated to him by the kindness of strangers.

Glenn Ford, 64, had been on death row 
since August 1988 in connection with the death of 56-year-old Isadore 
Rozeman, a Shreveport jeweler and watchmaker for whom Mr Ford had done 
occasional yard work.

But his conviction was quashed and he walked free from Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola, on the 12 March, wearing a simple jean jacket, jumper and beanie hat, carrying all of his worldly possessions in two tiny boxes.

nearly 26 years on death row

Prison officials gave the 64-year-old a debit card worth just $20.

The debit card, along with the money that he had in his bank account left Mr Ford with a paltry $20.04 to his name.

As he walked out of the prison gates, a TV crew from WAFB-TV asked him how he felt about his release. He said: 'It feels good; my mind is going in all kind of directions. It feels good.'

But as he began to put the pieces of his life back together, the newly exonerated man had absolutely no way to support himself financially after spending nearly three decades behind bars. 

In light of this, Capital Post Conviction Project's Louisiana director, Gary Clements - who acted as Mr Ford's lawyers when he was exonerated- decided to step in and help him by setting up an Amazon wishlist (which can be found here.)

Wishlist: This is the Amazon wishlist set up for Mr Ford to help him get his life back on track

It would enable him to receive donations for  things that would help him put his life back together.

The simple list of around 49 items include an ironing board and a pair of men's silk pyjamas.

And Mr Clements said that after Mr Ford's release he began getting calls from strangers asking how they could help, donate and  contribute.

Ford, an African-American, was tried and 
convicted of first-degree murder by an all-white jury panel in 1984 and 
sentenced to death.

Nearly three decades on, much had changed in the world and technology had advanced in ways that Mr Ford simply could not have imagined.

There were now smart phones, iPods, iPads and the internet.

Lawyers in the Capital Post Conviction Project's office were keen to give Mr Ford a taste of modern technology and put a second generation iPad on the wishlist. But the freed inmate is struggling to get to grips with using a mobile phone.

Lost years: Upon leaving death row, Ford told reporters that he does harbor some resentment at being wrongly jailed and denied the chance to help raise his sons, who are now grown men

The groundwork for Ford's release was 
based off a confession by confidential informant Jake Robinson who 
revealed that he was the one who pulled the trigger, killing Rozeman.

Robinson
 was one of four people initially charged in the killing. The other 
three were Ford, George Starks and the informant's brother, Henry 
Robinson.

State
 District Judge Ramona Emanuel voided Mr Ford's conviction and sentence 
based on the new information that corroborated his claim that he was not 
present or involved in Rozeman's death.

His lawyers Gary Clements and Aaron Novod said Ford's trial had been 
'profoundly compromised by inexperienced counsel and by the 
unconstitutional suppression of evidence, including information from an 
informant.'

They also 
cited what they said was a suppressed police report related to the time 
of the crime and evidence involving the murder weapon.

The victim's family were also notified of Ford's release from death row earlier this month.

'We
 understand that and actually believe the DA is acting honorably,' the slain jeweler's nephew, Dr Phillip Rozeman, told Shreveport Times. 'This is positive 
reflection on the criminal justice system that does the right thing for 
people.

On his release, Ford told WAFB-TV he does harbour some resentment at being wrongly jailed.

'Yeah,
 cause, I've been locked up almost 30 years for something I didn't do,' 
the freed inmate said. 'I can't go back and do anything I should have 
been doing when I was 35, 38, 40 stuff like that.'

The newly liberated man added he was sad that he had not been there to raise his sons, who are now grown men.

Under state law, Louisiana is required to pay Mr Ford $25,000 in compensation for 
wrongful imprisonment.

Mr Ford is also eligible for $80,000 for loss of life opportunity, but getting the money isn’t guaranteed, especially if state officials contest it, according to Mr Clements.

However, Mr Clements hopes that Mr Ford can begin to change his life with the things donated on the Amazon wishlist.
