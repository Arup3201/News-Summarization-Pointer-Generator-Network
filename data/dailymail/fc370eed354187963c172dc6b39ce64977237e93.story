He's paid off his dad's mortgage, splashed out on a flash car for his step-brother and cleared the debts of another sibling.

Yet EuroMillions jackpot winner Matt Topham hasn't even given his mother a birthday card.

The 22-year-old decorator - who shared the £45million top prize with fiancee Cassey Carrington last month - refuses to acknowledge Julie Gamble's 50th.

The pair haven't spoken since she walked out on his father, Brian, seven years ago and he still hasn't forgiven her.

After his win, Julie stressed that she didn't want any of his cash and wished him luck, but he wrote back saying she was banned from his life.

He also told her she would never see her grandchildren.

In his 12-line note, Mr Topham accused her of mistreating other members of the family and claimed she had forced him out of her life.

Julie told The Sun last night: 'I always buy him a card in case he turns up, but I didn't expect one from him.'

Meanwhile, Matt has paid off Brian's £80,000 mortgage and pledged to buy him a new car.

He
has bought his step-brother Paul, 41, a £28,000 Audi Quattro, promised 
to pay for his £30,000 house extension and paid off his £9,000 loan on 
an Astra Estate.

He has also cleared the £80,000 home loan of his other step-brother Mark, 44, according to The Sun.

Matt and Cassey have also vowed to give their 'bestest mate' Eddie Smith £1.3million.

Brian said: 'They will do what they want with their money to make their friends and everyone else happy.

'That's all I'm saying - it's no-one else's business.'

The couple recently moved into a 
£249,000 home wedged between a housing estate and a busy main road in 
Nottinghamshire - a decision which came as a surprise to their friends 
and family.

After scooping their huge windfall, they had spoken of building a ‘luxurious’ dream home from scratch.

Mr Topham, a painter and decorator, said he longed to live in the kind of home he had spent years decorating for other people.

Miss Carrington, a supermarket 
supervisor, added that they were avid watchers of the TV house-building 
programme Grand Designs and would love to do something similar 
themselves.

But they have since changed their mind about moving into a fancy property.

‘It may seem strange, but they just wanted to move into something close to family and friends which was a bit of an upgrade on what they had,' a friend said previously.

The couple had been burgled at their old house after their win was announced and decided they shouldn't move in anywhere too ostentatious.

The pair – who plan to marry this autumn – still hope to buy ‘a huge plot of land’ one day and build their dream home, but were in no hurry, the friend added.

But they have clearly been less than shy about splashing their cash in other ways, judging by the brand new Jaguar XK 2-Door Coupe worth around £70,000, and a £28,000 Range Rover Evoque parked on their new driveway.
