They are widely regarded as a safe means of making a phone call while behind the wheel.

But researchers have today suggested that drivers using hands-free kits could pose almost as much of a safety risk as those illegally holding their mobile to their ear.

A Canadian study found that drivers using hands-free devices were significantly more likely to make a host of potentially hazardous errors - from speeding to switching lanes without indicating - than drivers not talking on the phone.

Not as safe as you think? Researchers in Canada say hands-free devices that allow people to talk at the wheel can still increase the risk of driver error

Sales of hands-free phone devices have 
soared in the UK in recent years since it became against the law to use a
mobile phone normally while driving.

The law banning drivers and motorcyclists from using hand-held phones or similar devices came into force ten years ago.

The possible punishments for drivers or riders caught using their mobile range from a £60 fixed penalty and three penalty points, to being disqualified from driving and issued with a maximum fine of £1,000.

The only instances in which drivers are allowed to use their phone are if they need to call 999 in an emergency and it is unsafe or impractical to stop, or if they are safely parked.

Drivers are permitted to use hands-free kits, sat navs and two-way radios while driving or riding, but could still face a penalty should they be stopped by police who deem them to be distracted and not in control of their vehicle.

It was thought that using a hands-free device significantly cut the risk of driver error, when compared to holding a phone to the ear.

But the new study found that drivers using a hands-free phone made significantly more errors - such as crossing a centre line, speeding, or changing lanes without indicating first - compared to those not using a phone.

A study led by Professor Yagesh Bhambhani, of the University of Alberta in Canada, showed the jump in errors also corresponded with a spike in heart rate and brain activity.

Researchers looked at the brain activity of 26 participants who completed a driving course using a driving simulator.

Participants were first tested in a 
'control' condition - using the simulator to drive through virtual city streets while using no telecommunications device.

They
were then tested again while talking on a hands-free device.

The drivers were engaged in two-minute conversations that avoided emotionally charged topics.

Danger: Sales of hands-free kits soared after it became illegal to use a mobile phone in the usual way while behind the wheel

Researchers found there was a significant increase in brain activity while talking on a hands-free device compared with the control condition.

Prof Bhambhani said: 'The findings also indicated that blood flow to the brain is significantly increased during hands-free telecommunication in order to meet the oxygen demands of the neurons under the "distracted" condition.'
