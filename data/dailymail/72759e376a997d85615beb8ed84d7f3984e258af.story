Great Britain’s dressage team are the first to have qualified for the Rio Olympics in 2016 after an impressive showing from Charlotte Dujardin at the World Equestrian Games.

The 29-year-old, with Valegro, scored the highest mark of the day – 85.271 – to catapult the British team into second place overall.

That meant the side qualified for Brazil alongside Germany and Holland.

‘It’s been a great team effort,’ said Dujardin. ‘We had a good chance of getting a bronze so to come away with a silver is beyond everyone’s expectations.’

Dujardin won two gold medals in London two years ago in the team and individual dressage on the same horse.

She was awarded an OBE in 2013.
