Real Madrid superstar Gareth Bale has been ruled out of the season's first Clasico against Barcelona.

Manager Carlo Ancelotti broke the news ahead of Wednesday night's Champions League clash with Liverpool which the Welshman misses with a buttock muscle injury.

'We are working hard to get him (Bale) fit but he is not available at Anfield and not available for Saturday,' said Ancelotti. 'We are working hard on his recuperation.'

The absence of Bale will be a blow to Madrid who scored a spectacular winning goal against Barcelona in last season's Copa del Rey.

Ancelotti had been criticised for naming Bale as an unused sub against Levante in La Liga at the weekend but the Italian hit back: 'He travelled to Valencia (Levante's city) because we didn't think it was anything too much to worry about, just a slight strain. 

'It was only when he got to Valencia and had a scan that we realised the situation.'

Ancelotti was irritated however by further questions about El Clasico at his pre-match Champions League press conference at Anfield.

'It is very strange when you have this big match,' he grimaced.

The Italian said he was excited about the game, and in particular the stunning form of Cristiano Ronaldo, who has scored 19 times in 12 matches in all competitions for the reigning European champions. 

'You are going to see a spectacular encounter, everything that is good in football,' he said. 'It will be dynamic.

'Our player Cristiano (Ronaldo) is in a fantastic moment. It is impossible for him to do better. He is really focused on doing his best to continue.' 

Ancelotti said it was impossible for Cristiano Ronaldo to play any better than he has so far this season

Even without Bale, Ancelotti says Real Madrid will stay true to their traditions with Ronaldo, Luka Modric, Isco and James Rodriguez in the team.

'I would think our tactics and philosophy are pretty much the same if we are at home or away. We try to control the ball and possession of the ball with the qualiy of the players we have,' he said. 

Ancelotti said he was honoured to play at the ground where Bob Paisley, the only other man to win three Champions Leagues, was manager.

'It is always an honour to be compared to this fantastic manager. Every time I'm at Anfield it is a bit special because of the atmosphere.'
