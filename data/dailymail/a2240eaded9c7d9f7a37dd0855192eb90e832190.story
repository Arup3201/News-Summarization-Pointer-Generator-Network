When it comes to the World Cup, Thomas Muller is Germany's main man.

His record of nine goals in nine matches coming from just 10 shots on target coming into the game with Algeria is astounding.

And put simply: if Muller is on form, Germany win. His five goals in South Africa in 2010 made him the tournament's top goalscorer - and Die Mannschaft might have had a shot at winning that tournament if it wasn't for his suspension in the semi final against Spain.

VIDEO Scroll down to watch Muller's spectacular free kick slip up

Out of luck: Muller had a difficult game but never allowed the ball to completely escape him - as seen here

One: Muller begins his run-up for the free kick

Two: But after Schweinsteiger steps over the ball, Muller falls to the floor

Three: Muller crawls a couple of steps and then launches himself back up, over the ball

Floor: He runs away from the ball, into the box, but the free kick taker cannot find him

Five: Muller speeds off, much to the bemusement of those watching at home

1 minute: Germany look to play Muller in almost straight from kick off but the Algerians sweep up the attack.

23 minutes: Muller turns creator, slipping a ball out to Mesut Ozil but the Arsenal man's indecisiveness leads to him losing the ball.

35 minutes: Muller drifts a glancing header wide of the goal.

37 minutes: Germany's top goalscorer has a bit of a nightmare: He gets on the end of Ozil's parried shot but in an entirely out of character moment he hesitates, takes a bad touch and the ball runs out of play.

48 minutes: The Golden Boot winner tees up substitute Andre Schurrle with a cute layoff but Germany still fail to score.

50 minutes: Muller makes a claim for a penalty after some grappling in the Algeria box but the referee waves away his appeal.

80 minutes: Muller forces a great save from Rais M'Bohli with a diving header that the 'keeper beats away for a German corner.

81 minutes: After sidestepping a defender he toe-pokes wide to waste the best chance of the half.

87 minutes: Muller slips just before running up to a free kick - potentially deliberately - as part of a bizarre German set piece that ends in nothing.

92 minutes: He turns provider, playing a low ball across the box and a couple of deflections allow Andre Schurrle to get on the end of it and score.

117 minutes: Muller rounds the 'keeper but can't find the net in the closing minutes.

And while Algeria were taking advantage of Joachim Low's side's shaky defence - the Germans' real problem was Muller.

He has been in fine form for Germany at this World Cup but on Monday night his performance was not that of the clinical international goalscorer we have seen so often at this level.

Instead, Muller looked laboured, easy to mark and amazingly for him: hesitant.

A poor performance was summed up by his bizarre 'pretend-slip' free kick routine which ended with him alone in the penalty area but without the ball.

Muller ran towards the ball but fell just before the ball, jumped up, hopped over it and ran into the box. Schweinsteiger looked to find him but Muller was in a terrible position.

Earlier, in the first half when he found himself on the end of Rais M'Bolhi's parry from Mesut Ozil's shot.

Where you would usually except this Golden Boot winner to pull the trigger and smash home the rebound, he instead stopped to think for a second.

In that moment, the chance was gone - Muller waited too long and ended up foolishly kicking the ball out of play.

It was an embarrassing error, and the Germans gave him few better chances to make an impact.

Later, he missed the game's two best chances so far in the space of nine minutes, firing a powerful header at M'Bohli and then poking a shot wide from close range after rounding a defender.

It has been an obvious trend at this World Cup. Germany looked great in their opener against Portugal with Muller on song, poor against Ghana when Miroslav Klose's cameo saved them, and alright against the USA when Muller scored again.

Reflecting 
on his successful tournament in 2010, Muller said: 'I basically got 
lucky, I hit form at just the right time,' and in Brazil he has again 
mainly showed that good form.

Unfortunately
 for him, and Germany, that did not show against the plucky Algerians. 
Luckily though, Andre Schurrle was there to pick up the pieces - 
although Muller did put in the heavily deflected cross.
