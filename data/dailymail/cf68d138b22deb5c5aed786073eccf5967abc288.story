Britain's last remaining train factory has been thrown a lifeline after winning a £188million contract to build 130 carriages.

It is hoped the deal struck by Bombardier with rail operator Southern will save some of the 1,400 engineering and ancilliary jobs that are under threat.

Bombardier, which is based in Derby, has been in trouble since June when it lost out to a German rival for a £1.4billion contract to make trains to run on the Thameslink line. The 172-year-old former British Rail factory employs 3,000.

The Department of Transport was heavily criticised for preferring Siemens over Bombardier and the row prompted the Government to look at the issue of rail procurement.

The new contract with Southern – to build carriages for the rail operator to run commuter trains between Victoria and stations in Surrey, Kent and Sussex – will be part-funded by the Government with an £80million subsidy.

Funding for the deal came from money made available following last month’s Autumn Statement by Chancellor George Osborne.

A
source close to the company said: ‘Every contract we win is a 
significant step to us retaining our commitment to continue to make 
trains in the UK.’

Bombardier said it will begin production in the second half of next year, with the carriages expected to start coming into service from December 2013.

Transport Secretary Justine Greening said: ‘This deal lands Bombardier with a crucial order and I look forward to Bombardier workers in Derby being among the winners.’

But Bombardier has made clear it needs to win two additional contracts, each worth as much as £1billion, in order to safeguard the jobs that are at risk in Derby.

÷Clothing firm D2 Jeans has collapsed into administration with the loss of 200 jobs and closure of 19 stores. It is the first retailer to go under since Christmas.
