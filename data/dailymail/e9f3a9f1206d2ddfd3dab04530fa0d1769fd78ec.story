From student riots to anti-social behaviour, youths are often singled out for their lack of respect for authority.

But it appears that humans are not the only species with a discipline problem, as this lion cub's insouciant reaction to his father's bellowing shows.

The grumpy lion gave the playful youngster the hairdryer treatment for blocking his path as they wandered a trail in Botswana.

No respect: Despite the fierce roars of this pride's alpha male, this young cub seems to be completely unruffled

The cub remained unruffled, however, giving him a look as if to say, in the words of spoof terror-teen Vikki Pollard: 'Am I bovvered?'

The pride had been enjoying a stroll following an afternoon nap in the the Linyanti area, which straddles the border between Botswana and Namibia.

It appeared as though the pride's leader, nicknamed Romeo, had got out of the wrong side of the bed when, as his cubs frolicked in the warm sun around him, one ran on stood directly in his path.

Romeo roared and, according to witnesses, sent the terrified cub scampering away. On the evidence of these photos, however, it seems like the youngster remained defiant right up to the last second.

Anti-social behaviour: The cubs had been frolicking in the warm African sun when one provoked their father's wrath by standing directly in his path, prompting the fierce response

Photographer Dmytro Cherkasov, from Kiev in Ukraine, captured the scene while on a safari holiday.

'It was afternoon and the pride was slowly waking up after the midday rest. The last member of the pride to wake was the alpha-male named Romeo, who was sleeping apart from the rest of the pride,' he said.

'As soon as he woke up the pride went to the river area, for hunting. The zebras and impalas were occupying that area, mainly. We were interested and carefully started to follow them.

'Before entering the high-grass Romeo had a little fun with two lion cubs. Afterwards the glad cubs were running in front of Romeo and behind the two lionesses.

'Straight before the high-grass area with narrow path, one of the cubs ran after the lionesses while another one stopped as he was waiting for his father.'

Not a morning person: Following the parental castigation, the pride went on to do some hunting

Mr Cherkasov went on: 'Romeo didn't really appreciate that. He thought that the cub was blocking the way and he decided to castigate the small lion.

'Romeo bent closer to the cub and roared at him angrily.

'The cub was so scared that he jumped a bit in panic and run away to the open space.

'Romeo grumbled a bit on the way to the rest of the pride, but calmed down quite quickly. Later the pride continued the hunting.

'The two lionesses didn't react at all. I think they preferred not to interfere in the educational process.'
