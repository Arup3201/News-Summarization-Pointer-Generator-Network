A former boyfriend of socialite and model Tamara Ecclestone was today jailed for four years after attempting to blackmail the heiress for £200,000.

Derek Rose, 33, who dated the daughter of Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone in 2002, was involved in a plot in which it was claimed that he was approached to sell his story to a tabloid newspaper.

Rose was included in an email mentioning the possibility of discussing 'a non-release fee' and signing a confidentiality contract.

An email was sent by media studies student Jakir Uddi, 20, to Ms Ecclestone’s
agent saying ‘one of the biggest tabloids’ had made a ‘life-changing 
offer’ for a kiss-and-tell story when in reality, no newspaper had 
approached him.

The email said: ‘As you can imagine, since Miss Ecclestone’s show has 
been aired, my client [Rose] has been inundated with offers from a lot of 
today’s major tabloids, plus many television companies and radio.

‘Now they all seem to want to talk to my client about Tamara, and Tamara only.

‘I’ve asked my client not to talk to the press about Tamara for ten years, and have let her live her life.

‘On Monday this week we was approached (sic) by one of the biggest 
tabloids with a life-changing offer of £200,000 to disclose all.

‘My client is a quiet family man, and doesn’t need the headache of this story coming out.’

Judge Andrew Goymer at Southwark Crown Court told Rose: 'This was an audacious attempt to obtain a large sum of money.'

The court heard that he dated Ecclestone when she was 17, before changing his name by deed poll from Jonathan Ketterman.

The email was sent on November 16, 2011, the day that Ms Ecclestone had starred in Billion Dollar Girl, a reality television programme exploring her life as a rich youngster.

It said the newspaper had set a deadline of 1pm on November 18 for Rose to respond by.

The trial heard that the email had “pernicious” implications and was sent to elicit money from Ms Ecclestone, 28.

The judge said that 10 years ago, Rose, who sold his story to the Mail on Sunday in 2002, was in a relationship with Ms Ecclestone, which ended acrimoniously.

'You felt extremely hurt, and within a few days of writing a bitter message, you were selling your story to a tabloid newspaper, and that speaks volumes about your true character.'

'She came to your attention again in November 2011 when she was the subject of a television series. The email that you sent on 16th November in which you threatened to reveal personal details was not the product of a broken heart.

'All that was long in the past.'

The judge added: 'It was nothing more than a cynical and greedy attempt to extract a large sum of money.

'No doubt you thought that £200,000, which is a large sum to most people, would be small change to somebody with the amount of money that she and her family are reputed to have.

'You also thought that for this reason they would readily part with it to buy your silence. She did not do this.'

The judge said that the well-known, well-connected and well-off did not deserve special protection, but the reality was that they were more likely to fall victim to this type of offence.

He said: 'Blackmail is always an unpleasant and vicious offence. It can properly be said to be one of the worst offences that does not involve physical injury because of the fear and insecurity that it produces.'

Judge Goymer added that although Rose has ‘caring responsibilities’ for his 13-year-old son - a promising footballer- he still deserved a custodial sentence,

The jury failed to reach a verdict about media studies student Jakir Uddin who sent the email

Ms Ecclestone is famous for being the daughter of Bernie, the Formula 1 supremo

He said: ‘Although his mother is his 
primary carer you have taken an active and positive part in his 
upbringing and helping him to realise his ambitions.

‘He is of course entirely innocent of any involvement in this offence but your greed blinded you to the humiliation and misery that it would bring upon him.

‘There is a need to deter this type of offence which can be relatively easy to commit.

‘The least sentence I can pass on you is four years imprisonment.’

Representatives of Ms Ecclestone said that she  welcomed the sentence.

Her family lawyer Charlotte Harris of the firm Mishcon de Reya said in a statement: 'Tamara Ecclestone is relieved that Judge Goymer has acknowledged, in his sentencing of Derek Rose, the serious nature of blackmail and the need to deter others from attempting to commit similar offences.

'Ms Ecclestone was content to waive her anonymity in giving evidence because she strongly believes that all people have a right to be protected from such cynical and vicious behaviour. The sentence of four years is welcomed.'

Jakir Uddi stood trial alongside Rose but the jury failed to reach a verdict in his case and was discharged yesterday.

He denied blackmail, claiming he was acting under orders from Rose, and is facing retrial.
