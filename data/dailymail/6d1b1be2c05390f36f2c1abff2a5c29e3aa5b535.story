The mammoth effort to transport four Asian elephants almost 400km has already kicked off ahead of their trip from Sydney to Dubbo later this year.

Mothers Porntip and Thong Dee along with their calves Pathi Harn and Luk Chai will be packed into special crates and transported by road from Taronga Zoo to Western Plains Zoo.

Months ahead of their trip, staff at Taronga have started the process of familiarising them with their temporary homes for a few hours en route to their destination.

Four Asian elephants - including two mothers and two calves - will be transferred to Western Plains Zoo later this year

The herd of elephants will enable Western Plains Zoo to actively take part in the conservation of the Asian elephant species for the first time.

At the moment the zoo has two Asian elephants, Burma and Gigi, are over the age for breeding. Burma is 60 years old and Gigi is 57 years old.

A 750sq m extension at Western Plains Zoo will include a new elephant barn and two extra paddocks in the purpose-built breeding habitat on top two other elephant barns, pools, mud wallows and shade structures.

It has been designed so the two young male calves can move away when they are weened off their mothers, which reflects what would happen in the wild. Female elephants, known as cows, usually stay with their young in herds, but male elephants - called bulls - usually live alone.

They will take part in the zoo's first ever breeding program and join two other Asian elephants

They will be transported almost 400km by road in special crates

When the kids fly the coop, Taronga elephant manager Gary Miller said the mothers would get 'a new lease on life'.

'They’re going to relax tremendously because right now they’re looking over their shoulders all the time about what the young bulls are going to do,' he said.

'Are they going to sneak up on them or are they going to play fight or whatever?

'A lot of the time it’s good fun but they always have to be on their guard because when a young bull decides he wants to have fun who knows when that could be because it could be in the middle of the night, so they’re always a little bit on guard about that.'

Preparations for the Asian elephants' transfer have already started with them being introduced to special crates.

One of the mothers, Porntip, took quite a liking to the the box.

The elephants' names are Porntip, Thong Dee, Pathi Harn and Luk Chai

The purpose-built breeding grounds will have a 750sq m extension built on it

'Porntip we call her our go-go girl because she likes to go places,' Mr Miller said.

'When we brought the new crate into the barn she was itching to get over to it and to see what it was all about and get into it so again she likes to go see new things. She’s a traveller.'

The redevelopment of the elephant facility is due for completion late 2014. The plan is for the Elephants from Taronga Zoo to arrive late 2014 or earlier 2015.

The improved facility in Dubbo is expected to be finished by late 2014
