Part of the way through a group interview with newspaper reporters in America this week, Louis van Gaal paused when presented with a theory about Manchester City’s current eminence in the  Barclays Premier League.

‘I have learned the word “entice”. You are enticing me,’ said Van Gaal. ‘I said “provoke” yesterday but Ryan Giggs said it’s “entice”. That is what you are trying to do.’

Welcome to the world of the new Manchester United manager.

Complex and occasionally contradictory, but rarely anything other than fascinating. It is fair to suggest that life inside the  Manchester United dressing room is currently not dull.

Take another example. This time when Van Gaal was asked whether the stereotype of a typical English footballer — fit, fuelled by adrenaline and emotion, but  lacking sophistication — was true.

‘That is your opinion,’ said Van Gaal. ‘You say it, then you say I have to say it. I don’t know because I have to know the players first then I can judge. You can judge because you have been a journalist for many years and have seen the culture.

‘I have said the players under the direction of David Moyes were a lot different from the players under the direction of Alex Ferguson, but also under me.

‘But we shall have to wait and see. From the outside it is fair to say what you have said. But I don’t want to be judging as an outsider.

‘I want to hear that and feel that but at the moment they are doing great.’

Van Gaal has few complaints about his United players so far. Certainly not in terms of their attitude.

He knows the squad he inherited from Moyes is not good enough — calling it ‘broken’ — and is trying to fix it both in the transfer market and on the training field.

He says he will not buy players for the short term and is more concerned with nurturing players’ minds on the training field. It will, he says, be a long process but he believes he has evidence it will work.

‘The way you see Barcelona still playing with six players from my time is because I gave a lot of chances to the youth players,’ said Van Gaal.

‘The structure and the culture of the club is Xavi, Andres Iniesta, Carles Puyol, Victor Valdes and Thiago Motta (his players, though Puyol, Valdes and Motta have left).

‘At Bayern Munich it was the same. My players. Every club where I have been, I have struggled for the first three months. After that, they know what I want. How I am as a human being and a manager.

‘I say things as they are, so you have to adapt to that way of coaching. It’s not so easy. I train the brains and not the legs. I’m direct. I am not for running. I am for running with the ball, but they like that of course.

‘A lot of these players are playing intuitively and I want them to think and know why they do something.

‘That’s a process that is difficult and it takes time.’

Some coaches obsess about the bigger picture, others scrutinise in astonishing detail.

It seems Van Gaal will attempt to do both. Stories of life on tour with the Dutch veteran already include minute changes to seating arrangements in restaurants and an almost frightening obsession with time-keeping. Interestingly, he is an hour late for this interview, but, just as during the World Cup, he is worth it.

Over the course of a 25-minute chat he reveals more than it is  possible to chronicle in detail here. He says he was approached about the United job in the 1990s, for example. ‘I was already asked to join United in the 90s because  Ferguson wanted to quit at that time,’ he said. ‘That would have been easier.

‘I don’t think it’s easy now because when you have a club that normally plays from first position, and now you are seventh, then you know the team is not in balance or is broken, or that the confidence or something like that is wrong.

‘I had to follow Bobby Robson at Barcelona. He had won three titles. That was easier. I don’t think  “broken” is a hard word because when you are seventh the team is not happy, and without confidence, and when you are like that you are broken.

‘So now they have me. A new manager, new chances for the players and they want to show themselves unbelievably. That is nice that they want to do that.

‘But we have to make a way of playing football that is not the same as before, and that is difficult for them. They have to perform under pressure. They have to decide  what to do with the ball within one second and that is not easy.’

There has been much talk about Van Gaal’s new playing formation at United and it remains valid. It is radically different from what has gone before and the coach is perhaps right to warn of teething problems.

What strikes you most about him, however, is his sheer self-belief, a confidence that stretches almost to the point of utter conviction.

Certainly we didn’t see that from Moyes, who, in fairness, didn’t have a c.v. like his successor’s to bolster him.

‘I already had a lot of opportunities to work in England,’ said Van Gaal. ‘But at the time the priority was not like it is now. I am already 62, so my career is reaching the end. I was in Spain, Germany and Netherlands so there’s only one football country I wanted to see inside and that was England. I had more offers than just Manchester United.

‘I don’t say it’s a dream, because I am 62 and I know what I can do and I think United know what I can do and I think that is why they have come for me. I am not a child any more, but it’s fantastic because not any coach can work with the  biggest clubs.

'I have experience because I worked in Spain and  Germany with the No 1 clubs. I speak the language and, for me, communication is very important.’

Van Gaal has a reputation for a rather hard-line attitude with the media. So far, it has not been  apparent. He was skilful enough to duck questions about Chelsea and saw the Manchester City one coming like a train hurtling down a mile of straight track. One-nil to him,  perhaps. He knows the threat from across town to be real, though.

‘It does not bother me whether they are 10 metres away or 30 kilometres,’ he said. ‘It is amazing because they were not a big club before but now they are knocking at the door. But that is good, because where there is competition you can be proud when you are the champion. At the end maybe we will be the champions!’
