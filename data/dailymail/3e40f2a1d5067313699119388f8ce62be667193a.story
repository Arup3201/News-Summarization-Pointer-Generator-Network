Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone has heaped praise on Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez, raising the prospect of the Mexico star heading to join the Spanish champions.

Hernandez has been linked with a move away from Manchester United this summer following a disappointing campaign at Old Trafford.

The 26-year-old started just six Premier League games last season as he remained behind fellow strikers Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney and Danny Welbeck in the pecking order.

Simeone said: ‘He’s a vertical player, he’s great in one-on-one situations and he’s someone who could be useful to any team.

‘We are speaking to the sporting directors about the type of player we want and then it’s up to them to bring the player in.

‘With Javier Hernandez and lots of other great players, anything is possible. We can’t close any door until the transfer window shuts.’
