Nick Clegg has revealed his sympathy for Prince Charles, saying he was living through a 'nightmare' waiting to become king 

Nick Clegg has blundered into the debate over whether the Queen should step down in favour of Prince Charles by saying the heir to the Throne was living through a ‘nightmare’.

The Deputy Prime Minister sparked a Royal row by revealing his sympathy for Charles, who, he said, had been waiting so long in the ‘ante-room’ before becoming King.

In unguarded comments on the highly sensitive subject, Mr Clegg was overheard saying: ‘I’ve always quite liked him [Charles] actually. It must be a nightmare just being in this ante-room for decades.’

The remarks come just a few weeks after the unexpected abdication of Spanish King Juan Carlos in favour of his son, but there have been no signs that the Queen has any intention of following suit.

And last night, Tory MPs rounded on Mr Clegg for breaking the taboo that Ministers do not comment on the thorny issue of the succession to the Throne.

Stuart Andrew, MP for Pudsey in West Yorkshire, said: ‘Given that next year the Queen will become our longest-serving monarch, Nick Clegg’s remarks are as untimely as they are disrespectful.

‘Prince Charles gives as much dedication to his role as the Queen gives to hers.

‘Surely, the Deputy Prime Minister is not going to suggest next that she should abdicate! That’s not how we do things in this country.’

The Queen, 88, is due to become Britain’s longest- serving Monarch next year when she overtakes Queen Victoria’s reign of 63 years and seven months.

In contrast, Prince Charles has been heir to the Throne for all but three of his 65 years.

Mr Clegg’s surprise intervention, which came at a reception at Westminster, follows his staunch defence of Charles after the Prince claimed Russian President Vladimir Putin was behaving like Adolf Hitler over the Ukraine.

When the Kremlin angrily claimed the comments ‘don’t befit a future British Monarch’, the Deputy Prime Minister insisted Charles was ‘free to express himself’.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, shaking hands with Prince Charles, has been rounded on by Tory MPs for breaking the taboo on talking about succession to the Throne 

A spokesman for Mr Clegg last night said: ‘The Deputy Prime Minister was asked a question at a reception by somebody writing a book about Prince Charles.

‘He cannot remember the exact way he responded, but all he was saying was expressing that it must be a difficult situation to be in on a personal level.’

There were claims that King Juan Carlos had said he was abdicating because he did not want his son to ‘grow old waiting for the throne like Prince Charles’.

According to a report in Spain’s El Mundo newspaper, he had privately told aides: ‘I do not want my son to wither waiting like Prince Charles.’ Last night, a spokesman for Prince Charles declined to comment on Mr Clegg’s remarks.
