Davide Santon is ready to commit his future to Newcastle despite persistent advances from AC Milan. 

Santon's manager Renzo Contratto says a new deal's been tabled for the 23-year-old Italian defender to stay on at St James's Park. 

'Santon is happy at Newcastle and has just been offered a new contract,' Contratto told ASRadioRoma. 'Other teams want him? They’re just rumours.'

Staying put: Newcastle defender Davide Santon is ready to commit his future to the Magpies

Santon has appeared 93 times for the Magpies since signing from Inter Milan in 2011 but has been the constant subject of rumours for a return to his home nation.

Meanwhile, Mattia Destro is also likely to stay at Roma after a solid 13 goals in his 20 outings this season. 

While there are other clubs interested in the striker, namely Inter, Contratto says the 23-year-old is going nowhere. 

‘When a player is sought after by other teams it is always a pleasure,’ Contratto said.

‘This does not mean though that he will leave. Mattia wants to stay in Rome and be a leader for the Giallorossi.’
