During the early Eighties, the legendary jazz musician Dizzy Gillespie was introduced to the son of a wealthy London lawyer called Walter Houser, who co-owned Ronnie Scott’s club in Soho.

‘What do you want to be when you grow up?’ he asked Houser’s child.

The boy, who was not yet a teenager, did not have to pause long to dream up his answer. ‘A bank robber,’ he replied.

That child’s name was Sam Houser. Fast-forward 30 years and — while he hasn’t quite realised that lofty ambition — the once-shy youth has perhaps managed to achieve what he regards as the next best thing.

Sam, with his younger brother and business partner Dan, are responsible for turning a generation of sore-thumbed couch potatoes into bank robbers — at least on screen — thanks to the phenomenally successful video game franchise, Grand Theft Auto.

The duo, who live in New York, have each built personal fortunes estimated at  £50 million from the ultra-violent series, in which players assume the identity of ruthless underworld criminals.

Despite (or perhaps because of) its controversial depiction of sex, violence, rape, car-jacking, drug dealing, torture and murder, GTA — as it is known to aficionados — has shifted more than 135 million units since its 1997 debut.

That has translated into billions in profits for their company, Rockstar Games, which was founded in the late 1990s and now boasts several hundred (mostly male) employees, in offices around the world.

The brothers dress like rap artists, in chunky jewellery and baggy sportswear, and are obsessed with the modish image of the firm which they claim to have modelled on American hip-hop record label Def Jam. Sam, a dishevelled-looking, bearded 41-year-old, is the ‘ideas man’ behind GTA and other games. 

The Wall Street Journal once dubbed him ‘a secretive, demanding workaholic [with] a temperament and a budget befitting a Hollywood mogul’.

Dan, who is balding and two years younger, writes the ‘scripts’ for Rockstar. He lives in an 11-bedroom mansion in Brooklyn famed as the home where Truman Capote wrote his 1958 novella Breakfast At Tiffany’s.

Together, the brothers preside over a highly colourful working environment.

Employees are encouraged to wear 
T-shirts and bomber jackets embossed with Rockstar’s logo, and attend 
raucous company parties which have been jollified (on at least one 
occasion) by strippers wearing Catholic school uniforms.

In the book Jacked, a history of Rockstar, author David Kushner details the firm’s louche after-hours culture in eye-popping detail, telling, for example, how employees are encouraged to take part in ‘cheese ball eating’ contests.

The night-time events, in which the Houser brothers put up £2,000 in prize money, require entrants to eat fist-sized balls of deep-fried cheese while wearing Lance Armstrong-themed yellow headbands carrying the logo ‘eat strong’ (a play on the cyclist’s former charity Livestrong).

Buckets are provided for them to vomit into, along with bottles of tequila to help clear palates. The ‘company record’ is believed to be held by a programmer who scoffed 24 cheese balls at one sitting.

These lively — if somewhat juvenile — soirees are said to contribute to the atmosphere of extreme creativity at Rockstar, which prides itself on its ability, as executives like to say, to ‘think outside the box’.

Among the many ‘eureka’ moments which led to GTA’s success was an innovation (introduced for the third instalment of the game, released in 2001) allowing players to increase their character’s ‘health’ by having sex with a prostitute.

They could then advance in the game by beating or murdering the prostitute and stealing her money. In the parallel universe of video game culture, that apparently counts as an epoch-defining innovation.

In addition to their reputation for inventiveness, the Housers are also famed for their gruelling work ethic and commitment to perfectionism.

Tales of the demands they place on staff, most of whom work 70-hour weeks, abound.

A few years ago, for example, Gillian Telling, a former assistant to Dan Houser, alleged to the Wall Street Journal that he once called her a ‘whore’ and a ‘c***’ when she brought him the wrong kind of bagel for breakfast.

In another controversial incident, the actor Burt Reynolds — one of many Hollywood stars who have done voiceover work for Rockstar — threatened to punch Dan after being asked to re-record a line for what he was told would be a forthcoming ‘hit game’.

‘There’s going to be two hits here,’ Reynolds said. ‘Me hitting you, and you hitting the floor.’

One company staffer claimed that Sam Houser was famous for throwing — and breaking — office telephones, and that he was ‘prone to screaming, insisting on marathon work hours and rarely dispensing praise’.

One industry analyst has publicly compared the brothers to ‘the kids on the island in Lord Of The Flies’.

In 2007, two Rockstar employees committed suicide — though it’s not thought their deaths were related to the company in any way.

Shortly afterwards, the Housers attempted to improve the atmosphere in the workplace by hiring a spiritual healer to perform an exorcism on their office.

‘Wearing a long, flowing garment, with an assistant in tow, the woman strode through the office swinging crystals from a string as she moved from desk to desk,’ the Wall Street Journal later revealed.

Surprisingly, given their track records, the Houser brothers hail from the most blue-chip of backgrounds. Their mother was Geraldine Moffat, the upper-crust British actress who played Glenda in the 1971 film Get Carter, a role that required her to cavort naked in bed with Michael Caine.

The brothers were educated at top public school St Paul’s, in West London, where fees are £30,000 a year. They would be collected at the school gates in their father’s Rolls-Royce. Sam was a classmate of the Chancellor George Osborne.

Peers say he wore Doc Marten boots with his school uniform, was obsessed with gangster movies and hip-hop and that his A-level results were underwhelming. Dan, who was more academic, went on to read geography at Oxford.

After leaving school, Sam was hired by record label BMG, where he worked on the launch of the Spice Girls with pop Svengali Simon Fuller and directed the video for Take That’s 1992 debut, Take That And Party.

His big break came three years later when he was working in the firm’s interactive division. A Scottish company called DMA pitched a potential game called Race And Chase in which players could be cops or robbers.

He tinkered with the format, forcing gamers to play gangsters, rather than policemen, and re-named it Grand Theft Auto.

The game launched in 1997. Shortly afterwards, BMG sold off its gaming division and Houser  co-founded Rockstar, bringing his brother on board and taking control of one of the most lucrative franchises in gaming history.

In the early days, GTA’s success was built on its notoriety. Sam hired publicist Max Clifford to drum up controversy over the game and boasted of how gamers could ‘run bagfuls of [the drug] speed to a Member of Parliament’s hooker’.

Yet after a series of high-profile scandals in the U.S., where the Columbine High School shootings and several other mass murders were blamed on violent video games, the brothers found themselves under heavy fire.

Their nadir came in 2005, when they were denounced by Senator Hillary Clinton and called before the U.S. Federal Trade Commission when a secret, hardcore pornographic scene was discovered in the 2004 game GTA: San Andreas.

The Commission’s lawsuit, along with a string of other cases brought by regulators and gamers, cost hundreds of thousands of pounds.

Since then, the brothers have attempted to withdraw from the public eye, giving just a handful of interviews in which they appear to be attempting to re-style themselves as right-thinking businessmen.

‘I’m the most conservative guy you’ll ever meet,’ Sam — who is married with two children — told one reporter. ‘I have a panic attack if I even get a parking ticket.’

In the immoral world of GTA, on which the duo’s empire is built, that sort of attitude would surely mean instant Game Over.
