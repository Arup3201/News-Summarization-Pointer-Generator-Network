Behind bars: 37-year-old Bobbre Williams was arrested Wednesday after police caught her smoking crack and drinking with her 1-month-old baby girl

A Daytona Beach, Florida mother of seven was arrested on Wednesday after she was caught smoking crack and drinking alcohol while watching her 1-month-old daughter.

Police found 37-year-old Bobbre Williams outside a convenience store on South Martin Luther King Jr Boulevard where she even admitted to breastfeeding her infant while drunk and high.

Williams is currently being held without bond, while her child was taken to the hospital for treatment. It's unknown what condition the baby is in.

The sad incident happened in the early hours of Wednesday morning when a witness approached Williams sitting on a sidewalk outside the MLK Mart and offered her a place to stay for a night.

Williams turned the offer down and instead asked to buy crack-cocaine off the anonymous woman.

Fearing for the child's safety, the witness called the Department of Children and Families hotline.

Another witness later told police that she encountered Williams behind the convenience store, smoking crack and drinking alcohol while holding her baby.

That witness said she knew Williams from a shelter, which Williams had left the previous day.

When police arrived at the scene at around 3:20am, Williams admitted smoking crack and drinking alcohol while breastfeeding the child.

But she put up a struggled when officers tried to take the baby away from her, clutching the newborn to her chest.

Officers eventually succeeded in taking custody of the small child, which was then transported to Halifax Health Medical Center of Daytona Beach. The infant girl's condition is unknown, but cops say she gasped for air after the struggle.

Williams was subsequently arrested and charged with aggravated child abuse, battery on a law enforcement officer, possession of cocaine and child neglect.

When officers searched through her diaper bag, they found a cake-like substance that tested positive for cocaine.

She is being held without bond at the Volusia County jail.

Williams has a lengthy arrest record stretching back to August 2003 for drug and child abuse charges and was on probation when she was arrested Wednesday.

All seven of her children are in the care of the DCF.Â
