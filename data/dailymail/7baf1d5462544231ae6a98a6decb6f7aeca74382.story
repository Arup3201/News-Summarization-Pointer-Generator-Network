A German fighter pilot had to be rescued from tree branches after he was forced to parachute to safety just seconds before his Tornado jet crashed.

The German army fighter plane crashed in a wooded area near Koblenz, western Germany last night shortly after taking off from a nearby air base.

The pilot and co-pilot ejected from the jet before the crash during a training exercise.

But one of them landed in a tree and was left hanging there until police, army and firefighting personnel quickly rushed to the hilly region some 50 kilometres west of Koblenz.

Both pilots were slightly injured, but did not need hospital treatment.

A spokesman for the German army said on Friday morning that experts were now investigating the cause of the crash.

'We need light to see the full extent of it,' he said.

A spokesman for the airforce said: 'I’ve spoken with both pilots. They are doing fine.'

Police gave no theory on the cause of the accident.

On Sunday four people were killed when their business jet from the UK struck a power pylon in thick fog as it was coming into land at an airfield in Germany.

The aircraft - with two businessmen and two passengers aboard - was travelling from Shoreham airport in West Sussex to the landing strip at Foehren 15 miles from Trier when it crashed into a landfill site. 

The aircraft, a Cessna Citation 501, came down near the Trier-Koblenz motorway near the picturesque Moselle River.
