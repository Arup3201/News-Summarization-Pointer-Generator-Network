Off the hook: Zak Whitbread was caught driving an Audi at 97mph on the A14 in Cambridgeshire

A speeding Premier League footballer has been allowed to keep his driving licence despite having 17 penalty points - after he pleaded exceptional hardship.

Zak Whitbread, 28, was let off the hook by magistrates after he was caught driving an Audi at 97mph, because he said he needed his licence to find a new club.

He was released by top-flight team Norwich City in May. Sources claim a player in his position would have been earning between £4,000 and £7,000 a week - at least eight times as much as the average British worker.

The average gross salary for full-time employees in Britain is £26,200 - or about £500 a week, according to data published by the Office for National Statistics.

Whitbread, a defender who has also played for Liverpool and Millwall, escaped a ban despite admitting two speeding offences.

He was given eight more points to the nine already on his licence, taking the total to 17.

Drivers usually face a ban if they rack up 12 points, but Whitbread pleaded that he was now unemployed and would be unable to find a new club if he couldn't drive.

Simon Nicholls, defending, told Norwich Magistrates' Court that if the player had a job he would not have been able to make a special plea and would have been forced to make alternative travel arrangements.

But he said that, as Houston-born Whitbread was out of work, the player qualified for the 'exceptional hardship' defence.

Magistrates accepted the footballer's argument and fined him £780 with a £15 victim surcharge.

Whitbread was also ordered to pay £85 costs.

The chairman of the bench, Amjad Malhis, warned Whitbread he had come very close to losing his licence and said he would not be able to use the same defence in future.

Whitbread, of Little Plumstead, Norfolk, admitted driving his powerful Audi at 37.1mph in a 30mph limit zone in Grapes Hill, Norwich, on October 15 last year.

The footballer also admitted doing 97mph on the A14, which has a 70mph limit, at Fen Ditton, Cambridgeshire, on January 8 in another Audi.

Ellen Booth, a campaigner for road safety charity Brake, said the magistrates' decision had 'undermined the whole system'.

She said: 'Penalty points are given for a reason. Once you reach 12 points you have had multiple opportunities to change your ways.

'We believe that drivers who reach 12 points should face a ban.'

Mrs Booth went on: 'We have campaigned to raise awareness of this issue.

'By failing to ban a driver with more than 12 points on their licence it does undermine the whole system and sends out the wrong message.

'We therefore feel in this instance that the footballer should have faced a ban.'

Whitbread failed to earn a new contract with Norwich after playing only 18 games in the Premier League last season.

He made 48 appearances in total for the Norfolk club after joining from Millwall in January 2010.

It is not the first time a top sportsman has kept his driving licence after using the 'exceptional hardship' defence.

Last year champion jockey Keiron Fallon escaped a ban at Lincoln Magistrates' Court after arguing he could not afford to add a full-time driver to his entourage.
