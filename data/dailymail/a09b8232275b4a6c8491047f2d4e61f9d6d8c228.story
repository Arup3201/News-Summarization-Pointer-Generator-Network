It was supposed to be the fightback tour across the U.S. heartland to re-engage with American voters.

But President Obama appeared flustered and uncomfortable as he was confronted by angry Tea Party activists as he kicked off his make-or-break bus tour last night.

A beleaguered Mr Obama is trying to counter a massive in drop in popularity as a Gallup poll shows his approval rating has slumped to a record low of below 40 per cent.

Ryan Rhodes, right, clashed with the President at a town hall meeting in Iowa, yesterday

As the President appeared at an 
open-air town hall meeting in Iowa yesterday, one Tea Party activist 
shouted that he was unhappy about Joe Biden allegedly calling the 
right-wing group 'terrorists'.

Ryan Rhodes called for more civility 
from the administration, saying: 'Your Vice President is calling people 
like me, a Tea Party member, a 
“terrorist”.’

Mr Rhodes 
was referring to media reports that Vice President Joe Biden had made 
the remark at a private meeting on debt with House of Representatives 
Democrats earlier this month.

As Mr Rhodes and another activist 
further questioned the President after the meeting, he stammered his 
answers while trying to continue to shake the hands of more supportive 
people at the event.

During the meeting, Mr Obama had responded: ‘I absolutely agree 
that everybody needs to try to tone down the rhetoric.

An specially built armoured bus has been bought to be used by the President to use during the 2012 election campaign.

The bus costing at least $1.1 million is being used by Mr Obama as he travels across the Midwest.

The Secret Service has paid $2.2 million for two buses that will be used by the President and Republican candidates, but the cost is likely to be much higher because of extra security features added after manufacture.

Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan said: 'We've been overdue for having this asset in our protective fleet for some time.

'We've been protecting presidential candidates and vice presidential candidates all the way back to the 1980s using buses during bus tours.'

'They're certainly going to be used for bus tours around the country,' as well as other events, he added.

'When protectees go to remote areas, go camping or on a motorcycle trip, we'll bring the asset out as a mobile security facility,' he told Politico.

'In fairness, 
since I have been called a socialist who wasn’t born in this country, 
who is destroying America and taking away its freedoms because I passed a
health care bill, I am all for lowering the rhetoric.’

Today, on the second day of the three-day bus tour, Mr Obama is spending time promoting rural economic policies, among the series of remedies he is pushing to fire up job growth.

The President began with an early morning workout at a Decorah gym and later chatted with a few locals outside his hotel before getting on the bus to his next event, a White House Rural Economic Forum at Northeast Iowa Community College in Peosta.

As
the tour kicked off, Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney 
attacked Barack Obama, calling the trip around Midwestern states a 
'Magical Misery Tour'.

The
comment, which refers to the Beatles iconic 1967 album 'Magical Mystery
Tour', is a continuation of the GOP frontrunner's unrelenting attack on
Obama - a strategy he has pursued at the expense of criticising his 
Republican rivals.

A statement released by the Romney 
camp said: 'During his Magical Misery bus tour this week, it is unlikely
President Obama will speak with unemployed Americans, to near-bankrupt 
business owners, or to families struggling to survive in this economy.

'He
is more interested in campaigning in swing states than working to solve
the economic crisis that is crushing the middle class.

'Turning this economy around will 
require real leadership and the experience of someone who has actually 
worked in the private sector.'

The U.S. President will make five 
stops on the three-state trip to Iowa, Illionis and Minnesota -  in the 
first bus tour since he famously criss-crossed the country in 2008 
seeking the presidency.

Feeling the heat: President Obama wipes his brow as he takes questions on his bus tour

The elaborate $1.1 million battle-bus - nicknamed Greyhound one - is the first of its kind to be bought by the Secret Service.

It 
comes after a summer spent fighting politicians in Washington over the 
nation's debt crisis - and a day after two 'fast-rising' Republicans 
were mobbed at a fundraiser in Iowa - where Obama will make his first 
stop.

Obama will have the chance to absorb 
the public's anger and do his best to give optimistic answers as he 
travels between town hall stops.

And
with unemployment standing above nine per cent, the country feeling the
deep pinch of a stunted recovery and suffering the humiliation of a 
major debt agency lowering its credit rating, it seems he will have a 
lot to talk about.

His aides have revealed he is unlikely to engage any of his potential Republican rivals by name.

But, with his poll rating falling, he
intends to draw sharp contrasts between his ideas on the economy and 
the Republican approach.

He has dismissed that as little more 
than slashing spending on vital programs like education and Medicare, 
the programme that provides health care for the poor.

Sources also said that he was ready 
to hear complaints from disaffected Democrats tired of his compromises 
with Republicans, and from a public disgusted with a dysfunctional 
Washington.

The tour itinerary takes Obama through three states he won in 2008, but where he now needs to shore up his standing.

In Iowa, he returns to a state that handed him a key victory over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in 2008.

But it is now where Republicans have been blanketing the state in preparation for its first-in-the-nation caucuses.

The first signal that their plan 
could be bearing fruition came last night when the two fastest-rising 
stars in the race for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination were mobbed 
by adoring Republicans as they attended a fundraiser in the state.

Michele
Bachmann, fresh off her win in a closely watched test vote in the long 
road to choosing Obama's opponent, portrayed herself as a mainstream 
Midwesterner.

Newcomer Rick Perry introduced himself as a common-sense executive focused on jobs.

Both candidates attended the same county dinner in northern Iowa one day after the race was upended by Bachmann's victory in the Iowa straw poll and Perry's announcement of his candidacy.

And while both candidates have strong ties to the influential evangelical wing of the party and are popular with upstart tea party supporters, they told activists at the Black Hawk County GOP's Lincoln Day dinner in Waterloo that they have credibility on the party's leading priority, jobs.Mr Obama made a similar outing last 
year, travelling the Midwest in a two-day, three-state tour in April 
2010 that took him to Iowa, Illinois and Missouri.

There
was no bus, but the president's motorcade made hours-long drives 
through rural areas, passing school children waving American flags and 
seniors sitting on lawn chairs.

The
trip gave him a chance to engage in some of the grass roots politicking
he perfected in 2008 during weeks spent campaigning in the small towns 
that would help carry him to victory in places like Iowa.
