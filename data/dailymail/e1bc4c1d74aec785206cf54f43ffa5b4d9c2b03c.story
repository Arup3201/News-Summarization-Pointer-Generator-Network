The search for an aristocratic Frenchman who is believed to have murdered his wife and four children in cold blood has returned to the isolated countryside where he was last seen.

Police are preparing to visit underground caves and abandoned potassium mines in the area around Roquebrune-sur-Argens, where Xavier Dupont de Ligonnes was spotted by a CCTV camera in April 2011.

He fled his home in Nantes, western France, a few days earlier after neighbours reported not having seen any of the family for more than three weeks.

Suspect: Xavier Dupont de Ligonnes, 51, may be hiding in caves near where the family lived. Right, wife Agnes, 49, was found dead at their home along with her four children and two pet dogs

Detectives who visited initially found a severed leg under the garden terrace, and then uncovered the bodies of Mr De Ligonnes's wife and four children, as well as the family's two pet Labradors.

Agnes, 49, and children Tomas, 21, Arthur, 18, Anne, 16, and Benoit, 13, had all been blasted to death as they slept before their bodies were meticulously buried in a clear attempt to conceal them from police.

De Ligonnes originally came from Versailles, home of the pre-Revolutionary kings and queens of France, and was technically a count who could trace his lineage back generations.

In emails uncovered earlier this year he revealed that he considered himself to be part of a Roman Catholic elite which was superior to 'the masses'.

'I think I've got a superiority complex, you could call it that,' he wrote. 'But it's based on a simple observation: I belong to a group of people who are intelligent, determined, balanced and in good moral and physical health. Such people are rare compared to the masses.'

Recalling his strict, devout childhood, De Ligonnes added: 'All my adolescence was devoted to religion and faith, under the influence of my grandmother and mother.

'To such an extent that I did not rebel like other adolescents, nor indulge in drugs or run after girls.'

De Ligonnes was last seen on April 15 2011 when he left a budget hotel at Roquebrune-sur-Argens in the Var region on France's Mediterranean coast, abandoning his car there.

He was wearing a backpack as he strolled through a car park into the surrounding countryside, and was picked up by a CCTV camera.

An extensive search was carried out in the area between April and June 2011 and - acting on new information - police now intend to resume it.

'We won't be going back to the area already searched, but will be probing places which are difficult to access, including isolated hiking trails,' said a judicial source.

Caves and mines around near Roquebrune will be examined, as well as near Draguignan and Lorgues - both town where the De Ligonnes family lived in the late 1980s and 90s.

Shot: Tomas, 21, and youngest child Benoit, 13, had also been killed and their bodies put in a freshly-dug grave

There is a theory that De Ligonnes may have committed suicide in the days after the slaughter, in which case police will be searching for remains of his body.

However, prosecutors have not ruled out the possibility that De Ligonnes is still living rough, or else is being hidden by members of his extended family, who own country homes around France.

De Ligonnes's ancestors, who included the 19th Century poet Lamartine, originally lived in a southern province of France called the Rouergue.

Five months before the murders, De Ligonnes said he had inherited a .22 rifle from his father and started target practice at a Nantes shooting club.

Receipts found in his house also reveal that he bought a silencer, as well as a spade, a two-wheel trolley, chalk lime, and other equipment which could have been used to bury the bodies.

It also emerged that De Ligonnes, who ran a number of internet businesses, had severe financial difficulties. Among those he had been asking for money was a mistress in Paris.
