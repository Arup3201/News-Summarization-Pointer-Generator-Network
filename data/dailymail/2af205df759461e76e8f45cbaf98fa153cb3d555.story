At least 20 people have died as a result of plummeting temperatures caused by the 'Siberian Express' sweeping across the United States.

Nine people in Tennessee, six in Pennsylvania, two in Illinois and one each in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky have succumbed to hypothermia during the arctic blast which forecasters say will continue for most of next week. 

Another widespread round of ice, snow or freezing rain is set to start falling Saturday from Missouri to the mid-Atlantic and as far south as Alabama and Georgia - sending temperatures to their lowest point since the mid-1990s. 

Bruce Sullivan, a senior meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said: 'Higher amounts over the next two days will probably be across southern Indiana and Illinois and eastward through Ohio into western Pennsylvania. That's where it looks like the jackpot will be.'

Ice floes: One World Trade Center stands above the frozen Hudson River as temperatures continued to plummet in New York. At least 20 people across the country have died as a result of the arctic blast caused by the 'Siberian Express'

Ray Abey views ice flowing on the Delaware River at Pleasant Hill Park in Philadelphia. The National Weather Service says the newest band of Arctic air could plunge parts of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic into deep freezes that haven't been felt since the mid-1990s

Nick Wiltgen, a senior meterologist for Weather.com, said: 'This week ranks among the most intense arctic outbreaks so far in the 21st century for the eastern U.S., and it is certainly one of the most impressively cold air masses we've seen this late in the winter season, coming only a month before the spring equinox.' 

The weather system is called a Siberian Express because the winds are coming from Russia, traveling over the Arctic Circle and pushing into Canada and the United States. 

Sullivan added: 'We can almost show the trajectory from Siberia all the way to the U.S.' 

Bitter cold temperatures have shattered at least 500 decades-old records from Cincinnati to Washington to New York.

The National Weather Service said the low Friday got down to six degrees at Reagan National Airport, just across the Potomac River from Washington. At Baltimore's airport, the temperature dipped to a record low two degrees.

In western Pennsylvania, temperatures dipped to minus 18 in New Castle, minus 15 in Butler and 6 below zero in Pittsburgh - all records. 

Still frozen: Tree branches are covered with ice at Niagara Falls in Canada. Extreme cold has caused the natural landmark to be frozen for most of last week 

Posing: Despite the icy conditions, tourists are heading to Niagara Falls in huge numbers to take once-in-a-lifetime pictures 

Records also were set at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey (1 degree); Trenton, N.J. (zero degrees); New York's Central Park (2 degrees); and Cincinnati (12 degrees below zero).

In Massachusetts a barn collapsed under the weight of the snow in Westfield, Massachusetts, trapping several horses.  

Schools in Alabama sent students home early and NASA shut down its Huntsville facility Friday as a storm began unloading ice, sleet and snow.

The weather service said roads were impassable in at least seven counties.

Dozens of school systems dismissed students early or canceled classes altogether. NASA closed early at its Marshall Space Flight Center because of deteriorating road conditions.

Cold: Cars slow on Drake Avenue in Huntsville, Alabama, during a winter storm which pushed through the Tennessee valley on Friday

Problems: A truck is abandoned along the median of I-565 near as snow mixed with freezing rain and sleet caused chaos on the roads

Stopped: A police officer pulls up to a truck that moved around barricades while the highway was closed because of the extreme weather 

Skies: Light traffic passes in front of the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville as a winter storm moved across the Tennessee Valley. The NASA facility was shut down on Friday  

Barricade: Authorities were forced to close a number of roads around Huntsville while many students were turned away from schools 

Huntsville and the rest of the state's northeastern corner is under a winter storm warning through early Saturday, and forecasters say much of northern Alabama and Georgia could get snow and sleet, including metro Atlanta.

The deep freeze transformed Niagara Falls into an icy spectacle, encasing the trees around it into crystal shells and drawing tourists who are braving below-zero temperatures.

The Niagara River is flowing below the ice cover, so the falls aren't completely frozen.

But days of subzero temperatures have created a thick coating of ice and snow on every surface near the falls, including railings, trees and boulders. The massive ice buildup has become a tourist magnet.

Residents in Toronto are still mourning the death of three-year-old Elijah Marsh who wandered out into the extreme cold in no clothes and died. More than $100,000 has already been raised in donations for his funeral. 

Operation: Emergency workers try and recover two horses which were trapped after a barn collapsed at Booby's Ranch in Westford, Massachusetts. Several other animals were rescued 

Hug: Two members of the community embrace as the clean-up operation continues. The sheet metal barn collapsed under the weight of the snow 

Plummeting: Steam continues to come off one of the waterfalls at Niagara Falls. Meteorologists have warned a cold snap expected in the next couple of days could send temperatures to their lowest point since the mid-1990s  

Predictions: Another widespread round of ice, snow or freezing rain is set to start falling Saturday from Missouri to the mid-Atlantic

Mobility: This band will then move eastwards on Sunday. It is likely to stay cold for the remainder of next week
