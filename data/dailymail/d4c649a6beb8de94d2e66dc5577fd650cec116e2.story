Victim: Taylynn Devaughn, 2, died Sunday after being mauled by a dog in a Pittsburgh suburb

A two-year-old Pennsylvania girl has died after being mauled by a dog in a Pittsburgh suburb.

The dog attacked Taylynn Devaughn inside a home in West Mifflin -- located about 10 miles southeast of downtown Pittsburgh -- around 8:45 pm Sunday.

Responders rushed the toddler to Jefferson Memorial Hospital where she was pronounced dead at around 9.30pm Sunday,CBS reports. 

'I came out of the kitchen and the dog dropped the baby' Corey Devaughn, the child's father, told WPXI. 'His name was Jake and my baby was gone.' 

West Mifflin police Chief Kenneth Davies told the Pittsburgh-Post Gazette that the two-year-old, of Forest Hills, was visiting the home on Fleetwood Drive when she was attacked. 

Police say the child had been bitten several times by the dog and Devaughn said that, though he quickly called 911, there wasn't much medics could do, according to WPXI.

Homicide detectives say the dog is a pit bull mix and the Washinton Post reports that the dog is being quarantined for at least 10 days at a local kennel. 

County Lt. Andrew Schurman said that a district attorney will determine whether charges will be filed.

Devaughn said he doesn't blame the dog's owners and that Sunday was the second time the toddler had been around the pit bull.

'We know deep down inside, she's looking down on us,' Devaughn said. 'She has a lot of people that love her a lot. People all over love my baby. 

It is unknown whether the toddler was related to or friends with the family that owned the dog.

Police were on the scene for hours Sunday night, according to CBS, searching for more details about the circumstances of the  attack

An autopsy is scheduled for Monday and a district attorney is now reviewing the case. The investigation is ongoing. 

The tragic incident has prompted many Facebook users to take to WPXI's page to voice their opinion about the attack. 

However, the comments quickly escalated to a debate about pit bulls.

Many blamed the tragic incident on the type of dog. 

One Facebook user described pit bulls as 'naturally aggressive animals' while some held that the blame belonged to the child's parents, and others believed the fault belonged to the owner of the dog.

One user wrote: 'I don't understand the obsession with people saying pit bulls are great pets. Yeah the owners have something to do with their behavior but they are naturally aggressive animals. You will never see my children around any pit bull, even a 'well behaved' one with good owners.'

Another wrote that people should not 'bully the breed.' 

'All dogs have teeth and are capable of doing damage to a small child!!,' the Facebook user wrote. 'It's the (sic) parents responsibility to keep both children and pets safe and happy!' 

The story is still developing.
