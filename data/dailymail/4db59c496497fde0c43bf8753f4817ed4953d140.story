What have Fearne Cotton, Denise van Outen, Jo Wood and Leah Wood got in common? These stylish celeb mums have all taken #MotherTee selfies to support women survivors of war.

The #MotherTee is gaining cult status on social media, with fashion-conscious mums in the UK, Europe and the US snapping themselves in #MotherTees. 

Sold via blogzine SelfishMother.com, all profits go to Women for Women International UK to help women affected by war in Syria, Rwanda, South Sudan, Nigeria, Afghanistan and Iraq. 

TV and radio presenter  Fearne Cotton sported her slate grey #MotherTee on Instagram last week in support of the campaign. The celeb mum announced last month that she is expecting her second child 

Women for Women International helps women in eight war-torn regions, offering support, tools, and access to life-changing skills to move from  poverty to stability.

The year-long training programme teaches women how to write, earn and living and what their rights are.

The charity Women for Women International is supported by celebs including Angelina Jolie and Meryl Streep.

The campaign was founded by Molly Gunn, editor of Selfish Mother, a site she created for like-minded women in 2013. 

Actress and presenter Denise van Outen supported women across the globe this International Women's Day. Posting  her #MotherTeeSelfie on Instagram three weeks ago, she wrote: 'Ladies you need to get one of these! Brilliant cause'

Molly's website Selfish Mother describes itself as an 'honest blogzine on life, the universe, and everything'. 

Her Instagram account has nearly 2,000 followers, regularly reposting selfies of mothers in their tshirts from across the world. 

The slogan T-shirts can be purchased from the website Selfish Mother for £30 and come in a range of colours. 

Legendary rock and roll mother Jo Wood also took a #MotherTee snap in support of Women for Women International. The model and entrepreneur has two children and eight grandchildren

And £15 from each sale goes to Women for Woman International, a charity helping women in war-torn regions. The tees are made by women in a certified factory in Bangladesh. 

Sweatshirts cost £45 and are made from 85 per cent organic cotton in a Fair Wear certified factory.

 And in other feel-good charitable celebrity news...

Top celebrities such as Sir Tom Jones, Jonathan Ross, Jack Wilshere, Vivienne Westwood, Katie Price and over 50 more famous faces have donated their shoes to be auctioned off on the British Heart Foundation’s (BHF) eBay site as part of Good Morning Britain’s Heels 4 Hearts campaign.

Shoes that have been donated include a pair of cowboy boots worn by Alison Steadman for an episode of Gavin & Stacey, stilettos worn by TV personality and epic strutter Michael Van Schoick and the wedding shoes Gemma Atkinson wore in her first scene in Emmerdale.

Good Morning Britain’s Heels 4 Hearts campaign, supported by the BHF, will give every secondary school pupil in the UK the possibility to learn cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). 

Glamour model Katie Price supported the #Heels4Hearts campaign by donating a pair of white stilettos

Funds raised through the campaign will aim to provide every secondary school in the UK with a CPR kit so that young people can learn the life saving skill.

Good Morning Britain is appealing to the public to donate their unwanted shoes to BHF shops during the campaign (23rd to 28th March) which will then go towards funding the CPR kits.

In the UK, less than one in ten people survive an out of hospital cardiac arrest. 

Veteran singer and judge on The Voice Sir Tom Jones handed over a pair of black monk shoes to support the fundraising campaign, whilst TV presenter Jonathan Ross donated some black leather shoes

Yet in some parts of Norway, where CPR training is taught in secondary school, survival rates are one in four. If the UK achieved the same rates as Norway, we could save the lives of up to 5,000 people every year.

Diane Locke, BHF Deputy Retail Director, said: 'We’re delighted that so many celebrities have donated to Good Morning Britain’s Heels 4 Hearts campaign and are very grateful for every pair.

'We’re very lucky to have been donated all types of shoes, from designer brands and high heels to sport shoes from over 50 celebrities.

Arsenal player Jack Wilshere donated a signed pair of football boots in support of the British Heart Foundation's campaign 

'There really is something for everyone available, so please visit bhf.org.uk and take a look. The profit raised from each pair of shoes will help give us the chance for every secondary school pupil in the UK to learn CPR.'

Last financial year, BHF stores raised over £31 million to help the BHF fight heart disease, the nation’s single biggest killer.

Supporters are encouraged to get involved using the hashtag #Heels4Hearts.
