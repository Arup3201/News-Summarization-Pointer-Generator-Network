An Ohio family with a three-year-old daughter who has up to 1,000 seizures a day has moved 1,200 miles to Colorado in hopes of getting treatment in the form of medical marijuana. 

Addyson Benton, of Liberty Township, was diagnosed with myoclonic epilepsy at nine months old, which have delayed her communication and motor-skill growth.

And though she's tried at least ten anti-seizure drugs, nothing seems to reduce her symptoms.

Her parents, Heather and Adam Benton, researched a form of non-psychoactive medical marijuana that is illegal in Ohio, and decided it's in Addyson's best interest to give the drug a try. 

Young: Addyson Benton, of Liberty Township, Ohio, was diagnosed with myoclonic epilepsy at nine months old and has tried ten anti-seizure drugs with no result

Epilepsy: When Addyson (pictured here with her mom, Heather Benton) was diagnosed she was having up to 1,000 seizures per day

Development: The three-year-old girl (pictured here with her father, Adam Benton) has had delayed communication and motor-skills growth because of her seizures

The family already has two doctors in Colorado that Addyson sees once a year and both told the family that THCa would be beneficial, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer. 

They intended to move in October 2014 but decided to stay in Ohio after being told they were on a waiting list for cannabidiol oil that would be shipped to them from Colorado. 

After being told that the oil - called Charlotte's Web CBD oil after halting seizures in a girl named Charlotte Fiji - shipped to them until the  October 2015, they decided to finally make the move.

The family  had a chance to try the oil, which is usually taken orally through a syringe or an empty pill capsule, on Addyson before moving and said they can already see improvements in two weeks.

Medication: Addyson's parents researched a non-psychoactive form of medical marijuana that they believe will help their daughter. Her two doctors in Colorado, who she sees once a year, also believe she will benefit from the drug

Big move: Addyson's family is moving 1,200 miles from Liberty Township, Ohio, to Castle Rock, Colorado, in hopes of helping stop their daughter's epilepsy

'Her walking is better, her talking is better, her attention is better. It's phenomenal the changes we have seen in her these two weeks, but it has not controlled her seizures,' Heather Benton told the Enquirer. 'We really need to jump on top of that while she's growing.'

Once the family reaches Colorado, her treatments will cost about $300 per month.  

Their move to Castle Rock, Colorado, comes after two years of planning, and Adam Benton secured a job in the state before leaving home.  

Trial run: Addyson was able to try the CBD oil two weeks before she left Ohio, and her family said they can already see improvements

Expensive: The family has been planning their move off-and-on for about two years. Once they reach their new home, Addyson's treatments will cost about $300 per month

Organizations are trying to get the legalization of marijuana on the Ohio ballot for November, but the Bentons said that Addyson needs help now.  

'We need to get out to Colorado and come up with a plan and figure out what things are going to work for her. Once we figure that out, and Ohio's bill passes we can look at getting her on the same medication and then we can come back,' Heather Benton said. 

She added: 'Even if the bill passed tomorrow, if I went to my neurologist or our pediatrician, they wouldn't have a clue what to tell us about dosing and what's safe with her current medications. 

'We just want to be surrounded by people who know what they are doing.'

New bill: Though organizations in Ohio are trying to get the legalization of marijuana on the ballot for November, the Bentons said Addyson needs help now

Hope: Heather and Adam Benton's goal is that the move will help them find doctors 'who know what they are doing' and that Addyson's seizures can be reduced
