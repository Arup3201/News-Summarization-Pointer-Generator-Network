Sir Mick Jagger is among many celebrities who have taken advantage of the loophole

George Osborne has pledged to ‘come down like a ton of bricks’ on wealthy property buyers who avoid paying stamp duty on their huge houses.

The Chancellor said he would use this week’s Budget to make it illegal for rich people to register ownership of their homes to companies in order to avoid paying stamp duty, denying the Treasury hundreds of millions every year.

He said it was part of a drive to ensure that ‘all sections of society are paying their fair share’

Rock stars Mick Jagger and Ringo Starr are among many who have taken advantage of the loophole.

This morning Chancellor George Osborne promised an 'aggressive' attack on the property tax dodge by the super-rich.

It involves transferring ownership of a property to an 
off-shore company so when it comes to be sold the buyer purchases the 
company as a whole assuming de-facto ownership of the property.

Because the deal is classed as a 
corporate transaction as opposed to a property sale there are no stamp 
duty obligations involved.

This means that while a family buying a 
home costing £400,000 would pay £12,000 to the Government, a 
multi-millionaire buying a luxury pad could pay nothing.

The savings involved can be vast. 
Someone who purchases a £50million property though an off-shore company 
would avoid paying the treasury £2.5million.

Most of the transactions involve central London properties which are currently seen by the super-rich as a safe haven.

In
exclusive Cornwall Terrace in North London, where the average asking 
price is £35 million, every single home has been transferred to a 
company on the Isle of Man.

Former Beatles member Ringo Starr owns an estate in Surrey which was transferred to a Jersey company in 2009 and Lakshmi Mittal transferred his Kensington home into a British company eight years ago

Speaking on BBC1's Andrew Marr show Mr Osborne pledged to 'come down like a tonne of bricks' on wealthy 
people who sell properties through offshore companies to to avoid stamp 
duty.

'People want to make sure that all sections of society are paying their fair share,' he said.

'On this specific issue of stamp duty avoidance, rich people - often 
foreigners who come to this country but also people here in Britain - 
who put homes into companies to avoid stamp duty, that is completely 
unacceptable and we are going to come down on that practice like a tonne
of bricks.

'We are going to be extremely aggressive in dealing with it and people are going to face a very punitive charge.

'People have had their warning: they have got to pay stamp duty on the homes they live in.'

A
Sunday Times investigation found that rich homeowners have registered 
properties worth £200billion in 122 different locations around the world
to avoid the taxman in Britain in the past 12 years.

The most popular is the 
Isle of Man, with 23,147 properties registered since January 1999. Other
popular places include the U.S., Uganda and Libya as well as  The 
Republic of Ireland, Netherlands and Germany.

Jagger signed a 99-year lease on his Chelsea home in west London in 2008 through a company based in the British Virgin Islands (BVI).

His spokesman told the newspaper he gained no tax benefits from this and registered the company abroad for security reasons.

Meanwhile, the newspaper said former Beatles drummer Ringo Starr's Surrey estate was transferred into a company in Jersey three years ago and the late George Harrison's Oxfordshire home was transferred to a company on the same island in 2005.

Britain's richest man Lakshmi Mittal, who owns a £57m home in Kensington, west London, transferred the ownership of the property to a British company eight years ago but a spokesman for the tycoon said stamp duty had been paid.

He is among many overseas tycoons who have taken advantage of the loophole, alongside the wealthy Hinduja family, worth £6bn, and Rasha Said, the daughter of billionaire Wafic Said.

Repeated crackdowns on stamp duty 
dodgers have been announced by the Government, but the wealthy are still
regularly avoiding paying it.

Stamp duty on homes above £1m was raised to five per cent in April, meaning a buyer would pay a minimum of £50,000 in tax.

In November, it was revealed that even middle class home-buyers are exploiting the loophole to avoid paying stamp duty.

A clutch of financial services companies 
have sprung up in recent months promising savings of thousands of pounds
in house-moving costs through Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) mitigation 
schemes.

The companies, which often use cold-calling techniques and pop-up 
adverts on websites, claim the taxman has never mounted a successful 
challenge against them and insist they are both legal and transparent.
