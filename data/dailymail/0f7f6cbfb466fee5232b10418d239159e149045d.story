A woman has spoken out about the pain she suffered after slimming down from 300 pounds to 135.

Andie Mitchell, 29, was addicted to food at the age of 20 when she vowed to change.

But on the other side of the fence, the grass was not as green as she had hoped.

In a moving new memoir, It Was Me All Along, Mitchell describes how her life became a prison of calorie-counting, cravings and self-consciousness until she found a comfortable weight.

'It was a very hard time for me,' Mitchell told the New York Post.

'Food is fun. Food makes up some of my best memories, and I was changing my relationship to food and it changed my relationship with everyone else.

'It led to depression. I was like, "This is me. I've changed". And it really hurt my family.'

Food was already a big part of 12-year-old Mitchell's life when her 350-pound father died of a stroke at the age of 40.

She instantly gained 27 pounds, and from there ballooned.

'I was always the fat girl': Mitchell said it took her years to realize she ate instead of mourning her dad's death

Change: Mitchell used the mantra 'can you do it just for today?' to stop binge eating to reach 135 pounds

Painful: Despite dropping all the weight she wanted to, she then felt a pressure and didn't feel happy

On her 20th birthday, at almost 300 pounds, she spent the morning baking a sour cream fudge cake - only to eat all but one slice immediately.

She ate entire packets of McDonald's french fries, which she doesn't like the taste of.

Her first high school dance required a custom-made dress.

Finally, she stepped on a set of scales.

'I was 268 pounds. This was a really scary moment for me. Terrifying,' Mitchell told the Post.

'I just saw that my dad was 350, I knew that there were future versions of me that were bigger and bigger.

Yearning: She yearned to return to the optimism she had before that thinness would bring happiness

Low points: One day she spent the morning making a cream fudge cake then ate all but a slice immediately

'I was 20 years old. I didn't want to turn 21 having never felt good about myself.'

She started keeping a food diary, walking everywhere, cutting out sugar.

It was painful. 

'I felt that deep longing for sweets. Come 8 or 9 pm, my stomach felt hollow. I wanted cake. I wanted chocolate. I couldn't watch television without looking at my lap, where I wished there could be a bowl of crunchy something,' her memoir describes.

Within a summer, she lost 30 pounds.

The next step was surgery to remove the excess fat.

She felt 'attractive and desirable and valuable in a way that I wasn't before. And that made me sad.' 

In a TEDx talk about her memoir, she said: 'I started to realize that all of this attention came with its own baggage. 

'When that newness and that fun started to fade, I felt this pressure to maintain, a pressure to be normal. 

'The pressure was on all of these levels. One was on an eating level. My family and my friends believe this motto: 'eating big means living big'. They'd say to me: 'Cut the cr** with dieting Andie, eat half a calzone, that's fine'. 

'I didn't even know how to introduce calzones into my life again.

'On another level, a personal one, I thought my anxiety, my depression, my crippling self-doubt were because of my fatness; that they'd have gone away now. But they didn't because I was still the same person.

'I just wanted to go back to the same optimism I had that thinness was the answer.'

Now, after undergoing therapy sessions, Mitchell has decided to practice moderation in everything - and reached a comfortable weight of 150 pounds. 

'It's taken me 10 years to find a weight where I feel like, "I'm good here". It's the weight where you don't have to struggle. It's when you don't have to turn down an Oreo,' she told the Post.

Taking to the web, she charted every move of her journey in weight loss, weight gain and therapy to share with others having the same experience on the blog Can You Stay For Dinner?. 

In the process, Mitchell realized her addiction to food was a way of grieving for her father.

She shared the pain of breaking up with her long-term boyfriend.

She shared her passion for food - and has now compiled a cookbook of healthy recipes. 

'It was a catharsis that I didn't know I needed. It turned it into something meaningful,' she said.

'It's never just about the food, it's the way I'm using it to tell the story.'
