This is the romantic French hideaway where William and Kate have been soaking up the sunshine ahead of their forthcoming tour of South East Asia.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge escaped to the idyllic Chateau d'Autet, a historic hunting lodge nestled in Provence's picturesque Luberon region.

Owned by the Queen's nephew, Viscount Linley, the 19th century hunting lodge is set in 640 acres of woodland and boasts unspoilt views of fields carpeted with lavender.

The royal couple enjoyed total privacy at Viscount Linley's holiday home, close to the medieval village of Viens, which is equipped with a heated swimming pool and a tennis court, the Sunday Express reported.

Prince William and his wife are due to fly to Singapore on Tuesday, before travelling on to Malaysia - where Kate is expected to make a speech - the Solomon Islands, and the island of Tuvalu in the Pacific.

The secluded Chateau d'Autet was purchased by Lord Linley and his wife Serena in 1999, after the couple were introduced to the area by Peter Mayle, the author of the bestselling A Year in Provence.

The couple dedicated themselves to lovingly restoring the sprawling chateau, which comprises four properties and can accommodate up to 17 guests.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will no doubt have appreciated the chance to unwind at the French beauty spot, following a whirlwind few weeks in London amid the Olympic and Paralympic Games.
