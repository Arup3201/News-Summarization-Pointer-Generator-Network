A nine-year-old boy got through airport security and onto a plane without a ticket, it emerged last night.

Security officials at Minneapolis-St Paul International Airport screened the boy, whose exploits echo the Leonardo DiCaprio film Catch Me If You Can, at the airport shortly after 10.30am on Thursday.

But the unidentified child from Minneapolis, Minnesota, slipped through a security checkpoint and then boarded Delta Air Lines Flight 1651 - which left for Las Vegas, Nevada, at 11.15am.

The flight crew became suspicious and 
contacted Las Vegas police, who met the boy upon landing and gave him to
 child protection services, a Metropolitan Airports Commission spokesman
 said.

A security video also showed the boy at the airport terminal on Wednesday, the day before his trip, officials said.

He
 took a bag from the carousel that did not belong to him and ordered 
lunch at a restaurant outside of the security checkpoints, MAC spokesman
 Patrick Hogan said.

He ate and then told the server he had to use the bathroom, left the bag and never returned to pay.

The owner of the bag was identified 
and the bag was returned to him, Mr Hogan said. At this point, this is a
 Delta and [Transport Security Administration] issue,' he added. 'This 
is a rare incident.'

In a statement to Minneapolis TV station KARE-11, Delta officials said: 'We are investigating the incident and cooperating with the agencies involved.'

KARE-11 reported that authorities believe the nine-year-old boy is a runaway from the Twin Cities.

'He had to pass three levels of security,' said Terry Trippler, an air travel expert with ThePlaneRules.com, to the TV station.

'He had to pass three levels of security. You have the TSA, the gate agents, and the flight crew and a child comes through without even a seat assignment'

'You have the TSA, the gate agents, and the flight crew and a child comes through without even a seat assignment.'

Mr Tippler said that security introduced after 9/11 obviously still has major flaws. 'While we are safer in the air, this proves there are still gaping holes,' he added.

According to a surveillance video, 
at 10.37am, the unaccompanied boy arrived at the airport on a 
southbound light-rail car, the New York Daily News reported.

The
 boy was then screened at Terminal 1 and granted access to its nine 
airlines despite appearing to have never produced a required ticket.

In
 an apparently well-thought out plan that has similarities to the Steve 
Spielberg-directed movie, at one point the boy is believed to have 
blended in with another family traveling through the airport to evade 
detection.

'Fortunately, the flight crew took appropriate actions to ensure the child's safety, so the story does have a good ending'

Patrick Hogan, Metropolitan Airports Commission

The boy's parents told Minneapolis Police they 'hadnâ€™t seen much of him today' when officers arrived at the missing child's residence on Thursday after he was reported having run away, according to CBS Minneapolis.

Catch Me If You Can was based on the 
real-life exploits of Frank Abagnale, a teenage con-artist who, among 
many other scams, traveled the world posing as a Pan Am pilot.

'The
 fact that the child's actions weren't detected until he was in flight 
is concerning,' said Mr Hogan, who added that producing identification 
for children is not a requirement of travel.

'More
 than 33million people travel through Minneapolis-St. Paul International
 Airport every year and I don't know of another instance in my 13 years 
at the airport in which anything similar has happened.

'Fortunately, the flight crew took appropriate actions to ensure the child's safety, so the story does have a good ending,' Mr Hogan said.

'If it hadn't been for alert airline employees on our end, he probably never would have been discovered'

Bill Cassell, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police

Las Vegas Metropolitan Police spokesman Bill Cassell told ABC News the boy was 'more worldly than most nine-year-old kids.'

'He was able to get onto an airline where he didn't have a ticket and made it five states across the U.S.,' Mr Cassell said. 'If it hadn't been for alert airline employees on our end, he probably never would have been discovered.'

The station reported that Las Vegas police, Hennepin County authorities and the boy's parents were working together.

A statement on the TSA's website said that the federal funding shutdown meant no information on the incident would be immediately available online.
