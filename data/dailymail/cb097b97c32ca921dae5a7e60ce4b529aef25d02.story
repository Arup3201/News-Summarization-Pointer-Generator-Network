He might not have had the best of seasons by his standards, but Robin van Persie's two goals for Manchester United at St Mary's on Monday night demonstrated his enduring quality as one of the finest finishers in English football. 

They are a rare breed; not always the highest scorers or the most fearsome opponents, but the ones who find the back of the net with aplomb. 

Here are Sportsmail's top 10 most accomplished finishers in Premier League history.

10. ROBBIE FOWLER

Another marksman whose sheer quantity of goals should not take away from their quality. When Fowler was in on goal, there was usually only one outcome and he did it 183 times for his boyhood club Liverpool. God, as they called him at Anfield, was clinical and deadly, but he also did it in style.

9. SERGIO AGUERO

Manchester City fans would vote him onto the list for one goal alone, but Aguero’s legend will extend well beyond an unforgettable day in May. A prolific striker who had already scored 20 times for the champions this season before being cruelly sidelined by injury, the Argentina striker is also a stylish finisher who on current form deserves those comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.

8. DIMITAR BERBATOV

Another former United and Tottenham star. Ask fans of either of those clubs, and they would tell you that he could frustrate the hell out of them for 89 minutes and then produce a moment of brilliance to light up the match. If explosive or hard-working is what you want, then Berbatov’s not the man. But when it comes to finishing, and finishing in style, there were few better than the Bulgarian.

7. TEDDY SHERINGHAM

Another one who falls firmly into the category of Cavaliers rather than Roundheads. He wasn’t a battering-ram or a net-buster, but Sheringham possessed that flourish and demonstrated it on numerous occasions by scoring more than 360 goals in a career spent at Tottenham, Manchester United and, yes, Colchester.

6. ROBIN VAN PERSIE

The Dutchman hasn't been himself since Sir Alex Ferguson vacated the manager's chair at Old Trafford, but he came to United's rescue in style against Southampton. 

The second, in particular, touching Wayne Rooney's deep free-kick past Fraser Forster with the outside of his left foot, was typical of the panache Van Persie has shown in front of goal over the years for Arsenal and United.

5. LUIS SUAREZ

Suarez would feature in a lot of Top 10s, and not always for the right reasons. He left English football last summer with a rap sheet as long as his list of achievements. But at times during his eventful stay at Liverpool, the Uruguayan was simply unstoppable and his ability to score wonderful, spectacular and often audacious goals will live long in the memory.

4. DENNIS BERGKAMP

By the time he had left English football in 2006 after 11 years at Arsenal, the Dutchman had earned his place in the pantheon of greats. Every Gooner will have his favourite Bergkamp goal, but none will forget his poise, panache and even the odd pirouette. No wonder there’s a statue of him at the Emirates.

3. MATT LE TISSIER

At his imperious best, Le Tissier could fill up a Goal of the Season competition all on his own. Different to the others in the sense that he was an attacking midfielder rather than a striker, the Southampton legend was equally brilliant. He had an ability to dribble past players like they were training-ground dummies and an eye for the outrageous that few could match.

2. THIERRY HENRY

He started out life as a winger but at Arsenal developed into one of the most accomplished and stylish strikers in world football. Henry’s electrifying pace is what got him into goalscoring positions and, once there, the coolness of thought and precision of finish did the rest.

1. ERIC CANTONA

When it comes down to style, no-one did it quite like Cantona. Maybe it was the upturned collar, the puffed-out chest or the sheer arrogance of the man, but he seemed to view the football pitch as a stage, his stage, and performed accordingly. The Frenchman scored goals with the air of an artist applying the final brushstroke to a masterpiece.

1. Charlton 1-2 Arsenal, 30 September 2006

A sublime left-footed volley from Emmanuel Eboue's cross gave the Gunners all three points at the Valley.

2. Manchester United 3-0 Aston Villa, 22 April 2013

Wayne Rooney was the provider as his lifted through ball dropped onto Van Persie's left boot for him to crash home from the edge of the box. It was his second goal of a hat-trick as United sealed the Premier League title.

3. Arsenal 3-0 Blackburn, 26 November 2006

A fine individual run from the Dutchman ended with a brilliant curling effort beyond Brad Friedel late in the game.

4. Arsenal 1-0 Everton, 10 December 2011

Latching on to a perfect ball over the top from Alex Song, RVP smashed a first-time volley past Tim Howard to give the Gunners a hard-fought win.

5. Chelsea 3-5 Arsenal, 29 October 2011

Van Persie sealed his hat-trick and an emphatic win a Stamford Bridge with an unstoppable strike beyond Petr Cech and into the top corner.
