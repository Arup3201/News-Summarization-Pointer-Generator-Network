A taxi firm owner says he has been forced to employ two thirds of his workforce from Eastern Europe - because British people are too lazy.

Businessman Terry Spooner, 42, criticised the UK benefits culture which has led to local drivers preferring to take Government handouts instead of getting a job.

He turned to employing Romanian and Bulgarian drivers 18 months ago because he said no local workers were applying for the positions.

Now 20 of the 34 drivers at Ultimate Taxis in Newport, Shropshire, are from Eastern European countries.

And Mr Spooner believes their work ethic is 'ten times better' than local workers who have been known to regularly phone in sick or quit after a week.

The taxi company boss said that he started finding employees from abroad after being persistently let down by drivers from Shropshire.

Today, Mr Spooner, who has run the business with his wife Emma for the past 14 years, said: 'We’ve been taking on Romanians and Hungarians for 18 months under the Self Employed Right to Work law because there were difficulties in recruiting drivers locally.

'The difficulty in getting local staff was the reliability.

'A lot of service industries are recruiting Eastern Europeans to ensure they have staff who simply turn up. I was being let down too often.

'People would either pull sickies without letting you know or quit after a week or so.

'The benefits culture in this country certainly doesn’t help the matter. People balance it all up and they think what’s the point of going to work for an extra £150 a week, so it puts people off. And that is what is wrong with this country.

'These workers come over with the sort of work-ethic we used to have 30 or 40 years ago where we didn’t mind a bit of graft and getting our hands dirty.

'Now some people weigh up whether it worth that extra bit of cash when they can quite comfortably live off benefits - and that is why this country is in a rut.

'At the end of the day it’s not about nationality, it’s about individuals - but it is true to say some cultures do have a better work ethic.'

Mr Spooner says he is given the names of potential foreign workers by a third party and then either interviews the hopefuls by video link, or flies out to the country for a face-to-face meeting.

Once they are in the UK they are screened and have to pass an advanced driving test before getting behind the wheel.

He said some of his Eastern European recruits are highly qualified but come to the UK as the wages on offer are far higher than back home.

Many of his employees rent houses to keep their costs down and some send money back home to support their families.

He said: 'Some of the people we have taken on are highly trained.

'I’ve got one driver who speaks five languages and is a teacher, and another who is an IT consultant.

'In their countries they would earn 300 Euros a month whereas here they can earn that in a week.'

Driver Csaba Arkosi ,43, has been in the UK for three years and has worked at Ultimate Taxis for a year.

He said: 'I was working in customer support at a data company and was made redundant.

'I had to look for a solution as I had a big mortgage.

'The UK was the country which reached out with the solution.

'If I had to start out from scratch with a new job at home I wouldn’t have been able to afford my mortgage.

'I cannot predict how long I will be here, but I like the UK.'

Last week a survey revealed more than three-quarters of British people want to see a cut in immigration.

However, fewer people now than in 2011 think immigration is bad for the economy - 47 per cent in 2013 compared with 52 per cent two years previously, new findings from NatCen Social Research’s British Social Attitudes survey found.

The coalition Government brought in a three-month ban on EU citizens getting out-of-work benefits ahead of work restrictions being lifted for Bulgarians and Romanians on New Year’s Day.
