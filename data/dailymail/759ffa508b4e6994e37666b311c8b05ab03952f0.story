Workers on a cherry-picker were pictured putting fairy lights on the Christmas tree outside Downing Street this afternoon

In homes across the country this weekend people have been busy putting up their Christmas decorations, and it seems that Downing Street is no exception.

Workers were pictured this afternoon using a cherry-picker to hang fairy lights and other decorations on the tree outside Number 10, with a big switch-on scheduled for tomorrow.

The tree itself, a 20ft Nordman fir which took ten years to grow, was hand-picked by farmer Colin Griffith after he won a competition back in October.

Mr Griffith, who owns Dinmore Hill Trees at Festive Farm in Wellington, Hereford, won grower of the year at the British Christmas Tree Growers Association awards.

Runner up Rob Morgan, from Swansea, will have the honour of providing a smaller 11 and a half foot tree for the pillared room inside Downing Street, while Brian Taylor, also from Hereford, will provide the wreath for the door.

The lights outside Number 10 will be turned on for the first time this season in a ceremony tomorrow afternoon which all the growers will attend. 

Last year's tree was provided by Andrew Ingram and decorated with hundreds of LED fairy lights, along with silver and white baubles, topped off with a large silver star.

It is not yet known whether the same decorations will be used this year, though they have been used every year since the coalition came to power in 2010.

Nordman Firs - such as the one outside Number 10 - are the UK’s most popular Christmas trees and originate from the mountains on either side of the Black Sea, primarily in Turkey and Georgia.

They are favoured for the dark green, glossy needles and neat, conical shape which makes them easy to decorate. The needles are also slow to drop off, even after the pine has dried out.

This is different to the Norwegian spruce that usually adorns Trafalgar Square which is sent over every year from Oslo as a token of thanks for our assistance during the Second World War.

It typically stands between 60 and 70ft tall, and and is chosen months, or even years in advance.

The tree, dubbed 'the queen of the forest,' is cut down during a special ceremony attended by the Lord Mayor of Westminster, the British ambassador to Norway and the Mayor of Oslo.
