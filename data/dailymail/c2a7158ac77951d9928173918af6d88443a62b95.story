Leinster prop Marty Moore will miss Ireland's autumn Test series after being ruled out of action for 12 weeks.

The 23-year-old tighthead suffered a 'bang on his shoulder' in Leinster's 20-3 victory at Zebre on Saturday, coach Leo Cullen has confirmed.

Dublin-born Moore would have competed with Leinster team-mate Mike Ross for Ireland's starting tighthead spot in November's three-Test Guinness Series.

The five-cap front-rower's absence adds to Ireland boss Joe Schmidt's injury problems, with Sean O'Brien, Cian Healy and Fergus McFadden all out of autumn action.

'Marty got a bang on his shoulder,' said Leinster forwards coach Cullen.

'He's with a specialist at the moment but it looks like he'll probably be out for around 12 weeks.

'It's tough on Marty. He's been going really, really well for us and worked very, very hard over pre-season to get himself in good shape.

'It's going to be a big loss.'

'I'm not too sure whatever way he twisted his shoulder in the contact. It's definitely a bit of a loss, but he was just carrying the ball in to contact.'

Leinster player turned coach confirmed the injury to Marty Moore

Experienced tighthead Ross missed the weekend trip to Zebre but will be back in contention for Leinster's European Champions Cup opener against Wasps in Dublin on Sunday.

Former Leinster and Ireland lock Cullen backed the province to cope with Moore's absence.

'Michael Bent came on at the weekend, Mike Ross wasn't involved at the game but he'll come back into the mix and Tadhg Furlong wasn't involved either,' said Cullen.

'So we've still got the three of those guys there.'
