Hyundai has designed a bizarre egg-shaped concept vehicle, offering a new line in travel for commuters. 

The 'E4U' is an oval-shaped, open-topped single person 'scooter' similar to a Segway.

But doing away with the traditional two-wheel design, the prototype instead uses a 'rotating semispherical part' - which looks like the lower half of a sphere and is constantly rotating.

Hyundai has developed a new concept for the car of the future, putting a new spin on a mobility scooter - the 'E4U' an egg-shaped, open-topped single person 'scooter'

It works like the lower half of a ball and is used for propulsion instead of wheels.

While the vehicle is stationary when standing upright, as soon as the driver pushes forward it drives on at walking speed.

The driver stands on a small platform and directs the vehicle by tilting
 it so that different sides of the semisphere contact the ground.

It was unveiled at the Seoul Motor Show, in South Korea, last week, just four months into development, and currently has two safety wheels at the rear which stop 
it tipping from side to side.

According to Nikkei Tech-On, it works in a similar to a helicopter works, with the two rear wheels providing stability and friction to act like a helicopter’s tail rotor.

For the fashion and safety conscious, the top half of the 'egg car' can also be detached and worn as an attractive helmet.
