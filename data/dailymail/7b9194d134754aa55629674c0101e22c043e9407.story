Less than 24 hours after he was born at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, Prince George met his grandparents for the first time.

But the first arrivals were not the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. Instead, beaming broadly and waving at the crowds outside the Lindo Wing were Michael and Carole Middleton - better known to George as 'Grandpa Michael' and 'Granny Carole'.

Almost two years on and with the birth of a little brother or sister less than two months away, the Middletons have become a fixture in little George's life - with Prince Charles left to complain that they 'never let me see my grandson'.

March of the Middletons: Prince Charles is reportedly upset by what he calls 'the March of the Middletons'

In this case, the heir to the throne may well have a point. Visits to Highgrove, Charles' Gloucestershire home, have been few and far between.

By contrast, William and Kate regularly take their son to the Berkshire village of Bucklebury where the Middletons live in a £4.5m Georgian pile ringed by neat gardens and surrounded by open countryside.

Indeed, it was to Bucklebury that the couple decamped a day after leaving the Lindo Wing, with Prince George's first photo shoot a month later taking place on the lawn and overseen by proud grandfather Michael.

The intimate photos, which show George cradled in the arms of his smiling mother, were, with hindsight, a sign of things to come.

Carole, who to her credit provided a happy and secure childhood for her three children, was always determined to be a hands-on grandmother - and so it has proved.

But the Middleton matriarch's determination to be involved in her grandson's life hasn't always gone down well with the rest of the family.

'Carole has rather taken over, dictating when George naps, when and what he eats,' confided a source to the Daily Mail's Sebastian Shakespeare. 'All in all, behaving like she’s Queen Carole.'

So how much involvement does Carole have in George's life? The answer is plenty.

From cosy family outings to dispensing parenting advice to her eldest child, there are few areas of George's life in which the Middletons aren't involved.

Just a few weeks ago, Carole enjoyed an unbroken fortnight of quality time with her grandson in Mustique, where the clan had gathered to celebrate her 60th birthday.

Although nanny Maria Theresa Borallo was there to deal with most of the childcare, Carole, who has made no secret of wanting to enjoy a close relationship with her grandson, was spotted smiling happily as she walked hand-in-hand with a toddling George.

And that is far from the only occasion that Carole has enjoyed one-on-one time with George. Just before the trip to Mustique, the proud grandmother was spotted at a farmer's market with the third-in-line, who was, say witnesses, 'trying all the food'.

Speaking to People Magazine, another onlooker told of Carole's obvious pride in her grandson's progress.

'It was just really, really sweet. He was just being like a normal toddler is, running around and exploring – he is such a sweetie. He's lovely. A real bundle of fun.

'She [Carole] just keeps telling people "He's gorgeous, isn't he?" like any other grandmother would say about their little one.'

The Middletons also joined the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their infant son at Anmer Hall on Christmas Day where, according to sources, Kate made lunch and the family celebrated without any of the stuffiness associated with the more formal royal get-togethers.

Carole's influence could also be seen in the plans for George's first birthday celebrations which, in a break with royal tradition, included a Peter Rabbit themed party.

Contrast that with Prince William's own first birthday which was spent alone with his nanny Barbara Barnes because his parents were on tour in Canada.

Charles' first year was marked in a similar way, with the Prince of Wales spending the day at Clarence House without either of his parents, although the Duke of Edinburgh, then stationed in Malta, did send a model plane.

William, who has made no secret of the fact that he wants his son to have a 'normal' upbringing, is happy to spend time with the Middletons, with whom he has long been close.

Something similar to his fractured childhood, which despite the best efforts of both his parents, was blighted by their divorce and, later, his mother's death, is not what he wants for George.

Instead, having seen the happy home created for Kate and her siblings by Carole and Michael, he is more than happy to allow them into his son's life.

'Kate’s got a very, very close family,' he said happily, at the time of their engagement. 'Mike and Carole have been really loving and caring and fun. 

'They have been welcoming towards me so I’ve felt a part of the family.' So is George and so will the new baby become.

But what does that mean for Charles? Despite his complaints about the 'March of the Middletons', the Prince of Wales has 'an excellent relationship' with his grandson, albeit one that is partly dictated by the vanishingly small number of gaps in his busy schedule.

When he does see the baby prince, Charles is by all accounts a hands-on grandfather - not just to George but to Camilla's grandchildren as well.

Different: William is said to want a less formal childhood for his son than the one he enjoyed

Happy: William has a close relationship with the Middletons, in particular with father-in-law Michael

For evidence of that, look no further than the touching photos that emerged of Charles last summer, where the heir to the throne was pictured with one of Camilla's grandchildren clinging to his leg during a visit to the Highland Games.

More evidence of Charles' hands-on approach to grandparenting came when photos of a meeting a in Clarence House drawing room showed a picture of George given pride of place on a sideboard. 

Charles also greeted the news of a second grandchild with delight, excitedly telling journalists that 'It's wonderful to be a grandfather again.

He added: 'I'm looking forward to it - but I hope it will be a girl this time.'

But whether girl or boy, there's no doubt that Carole and Michael Middleton will once again be heavily involved in their new grandchild's life.

Perhaps, with the prospect of two young children to enjoy, Charles and Camilla will be too.
