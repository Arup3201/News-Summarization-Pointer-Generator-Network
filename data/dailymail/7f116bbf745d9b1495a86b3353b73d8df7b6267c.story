An NPR radio show host was last night fired from the music documentary she presented after she become a spokesman for Occupy D.C.

Lisa Simeone, of Baltimore, Maryland, lost her job hosting Soundprint, which is aired on National Public Radio affiliates around the U.S.

She is working with about 50 people on a committee for the Washington D.C. protest, which she said has similar values to Occupy Wall Street.

Fired: Lisa Simeone, of Baltimore, Maryland, lost her job presenting Soundprint, which is aired on National Public Radio affiliates around the U.S.

Freelance Ms Simeone was fired on Wednesday by Soundprint Media Center, which produces Soundprint. She also hosts ‘World of Opera’.

That show is distributed by NPR but produced by music and arts station WDAV in Davidson, North Carolina. That station is supporting her so far.

‘I don't cover news. In none of the shows that I do, do I cover the news,’ Ms Simeone said.

‘What is NPR afraid I'll do? Insert a seditious comment into a synopsis of “Madame Butterfly”?’

An NPR spokesman said the network learned Ms Simeon was participating in an Occupy D.C. group but added that she is not an NPR employee.

‘We're in conversations with WDAV about how they intend to handle this,’ a spokesman said. ‘We of course take this issue very seriously.’

NPR wanted to make clear nobody at the network has had contact with producers of ‘Soundprint’ or pressured them to fire Ms Simeone.

As for ‘World of Opera,’ the NPR spokesman said its code of ethics applies to cultural and news shows the network produces, acquires or distributes.

‘We are not her employer, but she is a host for a show that we distribute,’ the spokesman said. ‘She has that public presence.’

A WDAV spokesman said: ‘WDAV and NPR have different missions. WDAV respects NPR's mission to serve as a leading news provider.

‘WDAV on the other hand, exists to serve as a leading provider of arts and cultural programming nationally and internationally.’

NPR has come under scrutiny in the past year for its firing of news analyst Juan Williams.

He said on Fox News that he was uncomfortable being on a plane with someone wearing clothing that identifies them as Muslim.

NPR said he violated its ethics code by participating in media encouraging ‘punditry and speculation rather than fact-based analysis’.

The network has been sensitive to accusations that it carries a liberal bias.

An NPR CEO resigned after right-wing activist James O'Keefe posted a video portraying NPR's chief fundraiser complaining about the Tea Party.
