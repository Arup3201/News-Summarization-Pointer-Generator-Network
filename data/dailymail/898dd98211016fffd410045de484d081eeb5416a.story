A mother-of-three was shocked into losing 13 stone after doctors warned her comfort eating would kill her.

Tallula Douglas weighed 24 stone and was a size 28 before realising she was too fat to fit in the bath.  

That, combined with the terrifying fear when her daughter Beatrice began to choke while being breastfed, proved the tipping point.

'I was worried I'd eaten something to induce the fit,' Ms Douglas, 32, told MailOnline. 

'My weight was impacting on every part of my life.' 

Tallula Douglas, 32, from Hertfordshire, was inspired to lose weight after doctors warned she wouldn't live to see her 40th birthday if she continued to comfort eat. At her heaviest she tipped the scales at 24 stone

After giving birth to her daughter Beatrice, Ms Douglas said she realised she was too fat to fit in the bath and suffered a scare when Beatrice choked while she was breastfeeding. The 32-year-old said she was worried that her daughter's ordeal was caused by something she had eaten

After joining Slimming World, Ms Douglas has so far lost around 13 stone, and is now a size 12

She suffered high blood pressure, raised cholesterol and severe joint pain. 

When she was growing up, Ms Douglas, from Hodderstone, Hertfordshire, said she always considered herself the 'fat friend'.

But it was only as she got older and began to try for a baby that she realised the impact her 24 stone frame was having on her body. 

'It wasn't until I was trying to have children that I realised my weight was a serious health concern,' she told MailOnline.

'I was trying for my first child and was failing fertility tests because of my weight.  

'I suffered high blood pressure, very bad cholesterol and severe joint pains.'

As a carrier of the sickle cell gene, Ms Douglas passed the trait on to her eldest son, Lorenzo.

But after giving birth to her second child, Jayden, doctors revealed he had the full blown sickle cell anaemia disease. 

As a result, the then mother-of-two faced long stays in hospital with her baby son, as he received treatment for the disease which causes red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body, to develop abnormally.

'With Jayden being in and out of hospital, I just didn't have time to eat healthily, I just had to eat whatever was easy,' she told MailOnline.

The deterioration of her relationship with the father of her sons fuelled further weight gain, as Ms Douglas turned to food for comfort. 

She said: 'Things got really bad at home and my husband and I divorced, things went from bad to worse.

'I was by now, a size 28 and weight 22 stone. 

At her heaviest, after having her three children, Lorenzo, right, Jayden, left and Beatrice, Ms Douglas told MailOnline she reached a size 28

'I couldn't walk properly, struggled to breathe and sometimes even moving was difficult.

'It got to the stage where I was so fat I could no longer get into Jayden's hospital bed to comfort him.

'I was so ashamed of myself. I was seriously ill and couldn't even support my own children, I was that overweight. 

'I carry a lot of guilt over Jayden and his illness, and my way of dealing with that guilt was to eat.

'And when you're pregnant and couldn't drink or smoke, I ate even more. I think I am just addicted to food.'

While pregnant with her third child, Beatrice, Ms Douglas had to have more scans than the average expectant mother, because of her size.

She told MailOnline: 'I never realised I had to have so many scans because I was obese, I was high risk.

'I was so fat I couldn't feel her move, I was constantly worried

'I was being monitored everyday. I couldn't say if she was doing her 10 movements a day.

'My stomach was massive, I had to hold up my excess skin with belts.

'From 30 weeks I couldn't walk, I was housebound.'

After giving birth Ms Douglas was shocked to discover she was too big to fit in the bath.

'I bought a pair of pyjamas for after I had Beatrice, and I really thought they would fit,' she said.

While obese, Ms Douglas suffered high blood pressure, a raised cholesterol and severe joint pains. Her second son Jayden suffers sickle cell anaemia, and the 32-year-old said she was ashamed when she couldn't get into his hospital bed to comfort him, on account of her size

'After I had her, I went to put them on but I couldn't get in them, I couldn't even get in the bath.

'My weight had begun to affect my entire life.'

But it was two events, her baby daughter choking and a visit to the doctor that proved the final straw.

Ms Douglas said: 'Beatrice choked while breast feeding and I had to call an ambulance out for her. I was worried I had eaten something wrong. 

'I was so depressed I didn't have the motivation to sort my life out but a visit to the doctor gave me the kick up the backside I needed,' Ms Douglas said.

'I was told that if I continued to comfort eat and gain weight I wouldn't live to 40.

'My weight would physically kill me and I had to do something about it. So I did.' 

After speaking to a friend who is a Slimming World consultant, Ms Douglas vowed to turn her life around.  

Since shedding the weight, Ms Douglas has been able to take her children to Disneyland

She revolutionised her eating habits, cutting out greasy food, chocolates, crisps and banned comfort eating.

The mother-of-three joined a gym and with the support of her friends and family, got her life back on track. 

'I can now take the kids on days out and even took them to Disneyland - something I never would've been able to do had I stayed the weight I was,' she said.

'I couldn't even take the kids down the park, let alone to another country.' 

In recognition of her achievement, Ms Douglas has been named Miss Slinky by her slimming group this year and has been nominated Slimmer of the Year. 

And while she now weighs around 11 stone she said she isn't done with her weight loss mission yet, hoping she can reach her goal of a size 10.

'I never in a million years thought I'd be able to do this, I was so used to being fat that I thought I would always be that way,' she told MailOnline.

'I won't go back, losing the weight has really changed my life. I am proud of myself, I have lost eight stone in total which is a nice achievement.'

And she said her revolutionised eating habits are having a positive impact on her children. 

'How I eat affects my kids. Lorenzo is used to eating absolute rubbish, because that's all he saw me eat,' she said.

'He was eating whatever I craved when I was pregnant with Jayden and Beatrice.

'Jayden was always in hospital because he was ill so he used to eat whatever was easy, and I did too.

'But Beatrice, because ever since she can remember, I have been eating healthily, she eats nothing but fruit and veg. She loves it.

'It really does make a difference. 

'I hope my story can be an inspiration to other women out there that comfort eat.

'Life can be so hard sometimes, but only you can change it. I did it for my kids and I've never been happier.'  

Ms Douglas, said: 'I couldn't walk properly, struggled to breathe and sometimes even moving was difficult. It got to the stage where I was so fat I could no longer get into Jayden's hospital bed to comfort him. I was so ashamed of myself. I was seriously ill and couldn't even support my own children, I was that overweight'

Ms Douglas said she hopes her experience will help others shed their excess weight, adding: 'Life can be so hard sometimes, but only you can change it. I did it for my kids and I've never been happier'
