West Ham are famous for their 'I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles' chant at Upton Park, but the lyrics needed changing on Saturday afternoon after the bubble machine started blowing smoke instead.

Prior to kick-off in West Ham's Premier League clash with Manchester City, a member of stadium staff was seen desperately attempting to fix the broken machine, after it started emitting smoke.

His attempt at rescuing the machine appears to have worked though, as normal service was resumed when the players walked onto the pitch - bubbles and all.

West Ham sat fourth in the Premier League table in the lead-up to the match, four points behind Saturday's opponents Manchester City.

The Hammers won four of their first eight matches, beating Liverpool in the process, and went into Saturday's match off the back of a two-game winning streak.

City are desperately searching for three points to keep in touch with Premier League leaders Chelsea, who have already extended a five-point lead at the top of the table.
