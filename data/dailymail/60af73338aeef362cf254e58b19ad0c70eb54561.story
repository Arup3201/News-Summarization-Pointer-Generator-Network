Police shot dead an escaped £5,000 bull which was retreating peacefully into a shed, the animal's furious owner has claimed.

North Yorkshire Police sent PCSOs, two marksmen and a firearms commander in an armed two-and-a-half hour operation after Billy the Blonde d'Aquitane strayed into a country road.

Farmer Philip Marley insisted his bull was being herded calmly back towards a shed when it was shot and slammed the killing as 'outrageous and totally morally wrong'.

Furious: Farmer Philip Marley (right) has made a formal complaint to North Yorkshire Police after his prize bull Billy (pictured), a Blonde d'Aquitane worth around £5,000, was shot dead by marksmen on Monday

Mr Marley, who breeds sheep and cattle and has two butcher's shops, added: 'It's as if it was target practice'

The 45-year-old claimed police were 'hell-bent' on destroying his prize animal and said: 'It's almost as if it was target practice.'

Officers were called just after 11am on Monday to the village of Exelby, North Yorkshire, to reports the bull had escaped.

PCSOs kept the public at bay while a number of police marksmen, understood to have been at least two accompanied by a commander, tracked the animal as the incident unfolded.

The bull was then shot dead at 1.30pm - just as Mr Marley said it had retreated to a field and workers were encouraging it into a shed 40 yards away.

Mr Marley, a cattle and sheep breeder who also owns two butcher's shops, said Billy was worth £5,000 and has made a formal complaint to police. 

'It wasn’t an aggressive bull,' he said. 'I fed him every day.

'My nine-year-old daughter used to feed the bull along with some of our other cattle on a Sunday, and I wouldn't let the girl do that if I had any doubts about his character.

'I imagine she'd be very upset if she knew what happened to Billy but I'm not going to tell her. It'll be easier to tell her I sold the bull than have her in tears.'  

Upsetting: The incident on Monday lasted two and a half hours and ended in the bull being shot dead

He added: 'They had no right to shoot him - he was doing no harm and he was not a danger to anyone. 

'The bull got out and ended up in another field. The owners of that field put the bull out onto the road and called the police to say there was a dangerous animal on the road.

'The police marksmen then came and shot the bull, even though it was about half a mile from the road and causing no one any harm.

'By that stage there were people herding it into a shed and everything would have been alright given a bit of time.

'The animal was in no way aggressive. I've got plenty of his calves still here and their temperaments are all brilliant - very gentle animals.

'He knew the sheds and he wasn’t going anywhere. He weighed around a tonne so he wasn’t a fast runner. There was absolutely no need to kill him at that point.

'It’s a disgrace. They never gave us a chance.' 

A North Yorkshire Police spokesman said: 'The complaint will be dealt with by the Professional Standards Department. It would be inappropriate to comment further until this process has been completed.'

Mr Marley said it was unlikely his insurers would pay out because Billy had been shot by police. 

But he added: 'I’m not so bothered about that, it’s not the insurance, it’s the animal itself.

'He was a fine healthy bull. He was one of two. I’d had him about two-and-a-half years and would probably have kept him for another ten years.' 

North Yorkshire Police declined to comment on the specific complaint.

A spokesman said: 'It will be dealt with by the Professional Standards Department. It would be inappropriate to comment further until this process has been completed.'

Speaking generally, Inspector Mark Henderson added: 'It's the last resort for the police and firearms officers to take this action. We try everything else but if the public are in danger, that's our priority.'
