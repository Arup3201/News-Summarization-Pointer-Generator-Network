Going into the game Barcelona were yet to concede this season, but a 10th-minute goal from David Luiz quickly brought that run to an end. 

Messi quickly got his side back into the game, but Marco Verratti and Blaise Matuidi put the French champions 3-1 ahead. 

Neymar quickly got the score back to 3-2, but PSG managed to hold on for the win.

Meanwhile, Luis Suarez was also in action as he closes in on his return to competitive action on October 26.
