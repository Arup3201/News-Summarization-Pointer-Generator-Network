Thousands of passengers faced delays and disruption at UK airports today as a six-day French air traffic control strike began.

Queues of holidaymakers built up at Stansted Airport in Essex as airlines were forced to cancel dozens of flights crossing French airspace due to the industrial action.

Extra police and security guards were drafted in to deal with the crowds at the airport, as Ryanair accused French air traffic controllers of holding travellers to ransom through their 'selfish actions'.

Walkout: The six-day strike is grounding 250 Ryanair flights today and a further 150 easyJet flights

Knock-on effect: Passengers were delayed at Stansted Airport as the French air traffic strike got underway

One 
holiday maker Jane Goulding, 47, said: 'I have never seen the airport 
this busy before. I'm worried I'm going to be queuing here for hours.'

Eurocontrol, a European air safety organisation, estimated the action would cause almost 14,000 hours, of delays.

There are estimated to be around 350 direct flights between Britain and France during the planned strike period.

Ryanair has been forced to cancel 26 flights today and said customers should be prepared for delays and further cancellations.

Long wait: Extra security was drafted in at Stansted to help control the crowds gathering

Uncertainty: Chaos ruled at the airport as airlines waited on the latest news from France about whether flights could cross French airspace

Kenny
 Jacobs, of Ryanair, said: 'Ryanair regrets that we have had to cancel 
26 flights on Tuesday as a result of these unwarranted strikes by French
 air traffic controllers, who have deliberately initiated industrial 
actions at the busiest time of the year in order to cause maximum chaos.

'Ordinary
 people who work hard all year to take a well-earned holiday have had 
their travel plans disrupted through no fault of theirs, or of 
Ryanair's, because of the selfish actions of so few.'

He said passengers should long onto the Ryanair website and check the latest flight information before leaving for the airport.

Delays: A spokesman for Stansted Airport said they were working with the airlines to make sure passengers had the latest information about their flights

A
 spokesman for Stansted Airport said they were working with the airlines
 to make sure passengers had the latest information about their flights.

He
 said: 'It is a frustrating and disappointing situation for the 
passengers. Passengers should keep checking with the airline before 
setting off to see the latest information as the situation is constantly
 unfolding.'

Members
 of the two biggest air traffic controllers' unions in France originally
 voted for a six-day strike from Tuesday in protest at budget cuts.

The
 industrial action, which started today and will last until the end of 
Sunday, has led to budget carriers Ryanair and easyJet axing more than 
50 services in one day.

British Airways has also cancelled three flights from Heathrow to the French cities of Lyon, Marseille and Toulouse.

However, easyJet has not had to cancel as many flights as first feared. The airline expected to axe up to 50 per cent of flights over the six days, but has so far only cancelled 25 per cent.

Tourists have been told to expect long delays at every French airport, including Charles de Gaulles, pictured,  in Paris as the entire air system will be affected by the walk-outs

EasyJet 
said some UK-originating flights might still be affected, while Ryanair 
also warned passengers that the strike could affect flights overflying 
France, adding: 'We expect further flight delays and cancellations.'

EasyJet
 said: 'We are disappointed at this unnecessary strike action which has 
the potential to cause considerable disruption and cancellations for 
passengers and airlines across Europe.

'Despite the fact that this disruption is beyond easyJet's control we will do everything possible to minimise the inconvenience to our customers. We will proactively provide advice for our passengers through our website, text messages and flight tracker tool.'

BA said: 'Due to industrial action by air traffic controllers in France we have been forced to cancel a small number of flights on Tuesday and are expecting knock-on delays to some other short-haul services.

'We will look to use larger aircraft where we can to help affected customers on cancelled flights so they can rebook free of charge to alternative flights.

'We would urge customers to keep checking our website during the week for the very latest information about their specific flights.'

The Socialist government of Francois Hollande, pictured, insists that the cuts are necessary to comply with European Commission plans to reduce air navigation costs

Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'Check with your airline before travelling to find out if you'll be affected by the French air strike action.

'If you are affected, visit the Which? Consumer Rights website and find out your rights because if your flight is delayed due to a strike, the airline may have an obligation to offer you assistance.'

Air traffic controllers are just one of a host of sectors staging industrial action and crippling the tourism industry in France.

Travellers hoping to take alternative rail routes will face further delays thanks to a ten-day rail protest.

French retail workers are also set to strike in protest at the governmentâ€™s decision to introduce Sunday opening hours to boost tourism.

This will mean that famous Paris department stores including Galeries Lafayette and Printemps will be closed for those who do make it across the Channel.
