It may look like a treat for those with expensive tastes but this marshmallow topped with 24 carat gold really is a sweet deal. 

The silky smooth strawberry Champagne marshmallow is swirled with Belgian chocolate and topped with pure edible 24-carat gold. 

Yet despite its striking appearance a pack of four will only set buyers back a bargain $14.99 (£10).

The Golden Riviera marshmallow is made from strawberry champagne and topped with 24-carat gold 

Champagne with your whiskey? The posh marshmallow is the perfect side for an Irish coffee

The posh treat is the creation of Vivéltre, an independent sweet maker, and and is hand-made using 100 per cent natural ingredients.

The US-based company has named its creation the 'Golden Riviera' and this isn't the only unusual sweet treat it has on offer. 

The flavour combinations are certainly not what you would expect to see in your local corner shop with 14 different varieties ranging from the Nutella to the luxurious 'French Riviera', flavoured with rose Champagne and fresh strawberries.

There is even a sweet treat inspired by the heated marshmallow, chocolate and cracker combination - the s'more. 

Viveltre's new marshmallows contain Champagne and are topped with edible gold leaf 

The boutique sweet shop in Florida have created a range of inventive flavoured marshmallows

Made using vanilla marshmallow infused with chocolate chips and biscuits, it is all the flavour of the real deal minus the mess while camping. 

Irina Bromberry is the creative mind behind Vivéltre who started making the inventive marshmallows after she was encouraged to by her son.

She said: 'We are thrilled to showcase our expertise with this new and exciting item.

'We have made it possible for lovers of gourmet confections everywhere to embark on an epic flavour journey.

The unusual flavours include Nutella, the popular hazelnut spread

'This unique item is another example of our continued commitment to letting customers enjoy handcrafted marshmallows in entirely new and unexpected ways.'

Two years after he asked her to make the fluffy sweets, Irina started Vivéltre from her home in Miami, Florida and she has been overwhelmed with the demand.

Irina says that coming up with the different varieties is something very personal and can take up a lot of her time.

'I come up with the different flavours in all sorts of ways. Sometimes it's based on things that have sentimental value in my life - like the caramel and Nutella flavours - so I look for ways to integrate them into marshmallows.' 

Irina Bromberry (pictured) says that people refer to her as the dessert alchemist 

Irina began creating the marshmallows for her son two years ago and has since turned her creativity into a successful business, pictured here- Chocolate ganache flavour 

Once Irina has an idea for a new type of sweet she has a meticulous method of constructing the marshmallow, making sure the flavour balance is perfect. 

'But other times I think of a flavour first and use complicated algorithms to find the perfect ratio of ingredients like I did with the Ultimate S'mores.

'They call me dessert alchemist around here.' 

Four months ago the company raised enough cash to launch via Kickstarter and hope to use their success to expand in to different treats.
