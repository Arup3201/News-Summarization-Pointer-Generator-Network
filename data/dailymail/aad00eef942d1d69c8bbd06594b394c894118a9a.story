England are set to name an unchanged XI in Thursday's fourth Investec Test against India in Manchester after squaring the series in Southampton last week.

Barring a late change of plan, that will mean no instant return for Middlesex fast bowler Steven Finn, who was added to the 13-man squad in place on the injured Liam Plunkett and has been talked up by England in the build-up to this game.

Sportsmail understands that the England selectors are not willing to tinker with a winning team, which means a reprieve for Chris Jordan, the Sussex seamer who struggled with his rhythm at the Ageas Bowl and whose five Test wickets have so far cost 70 apiece.

The news will have come as a disappointment to Finn, who is said to be back to something approaching his best after being deemed unselectable by England ever since returning early from the disastrous Ashes tour last winter.

He has picked up 44 Division One wickets in the County Championship this season at 29 apiece, and England selector Angus Fraser suggested on Sunday that the ‘time was right’ for him to rejoin the international fray.

Asked about the possibility about of making a change for this side, Alastair Cook said: ‘We hadn’t won for 10 games. You always try to pick your best team, but you balance that with continuity. Guys in that team don’t want to be keep looking over shoulder – I’m in and I’m out. You make calls like that, but successful sides built on a bit more stability than that.’

Old Trafford is expected to offer more bounce than any surface England have encountered this summer, leading to speculation that the 6ft 7in Finn was set to make his return. The onus could now fall on England’s next-tallest bowler, Stuart Broad, to make an impact.

India, meanwhile, could make three changes to the team who put up so little resistance at Southampton. Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin could play his first game of the series, in place of batsman Rohit Sharma, while fast bowler Varun Aaron is in the mix, possibly at the expense of the luckless Pankaj Singh.

India could go for experience at the top of the order, too, where Gautam Gambhir might replace Shikhar Dhawan.
