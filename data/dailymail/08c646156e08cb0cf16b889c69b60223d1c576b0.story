Children are no longer permitted on the streets of Miami after hours as part of a curfew now in effect that cites safety concerns amid a series of recent deadly shootings.

Kids 16 and younger must now be home from 11pm to 6am, Sunday to Thursday, and from midnight to 6am on Friday and Saturday according to the new rules that went into effect on Wednesday.

A specific reason was not given by the police department for the curfew that's usually seen during summer months though residents readily attribute recent violence and deaths to its enforcement.

Curfew: Children under 17 years of age are no longer permitted on the streets of Miami from 11pm to 6am, Sunday to Thursday, and midnight to 6am on Friday and Saturday

Reaction: Miami teen Keith Steart said that he doesn't think he needs a curfew but understands why it's important with teens like him losing their lives to violence

'I don't really need a curfew,' Miami teen Keith Steart told NBC Miami, 'but I do feel that a curfew is important because young kids like my age are dying in the streets.'

'You don't know what's going on,' said Pete Soriano of Team Pete Sports. 'You've got drug dealings, you've got shoot outs, kids getting killed left and right.'

In recent days at least eight people were shot in Miami including three teenagers - two of which were killed.

'I’ve had young people come in and tell me I’ve had two or three friends killed, I’m not going to live until 21,' Sgt Eunice Cooper of Miami's homicide unit recently told CBS4.

'And that’s just how they feel. That’s just how it is. It’s almost as if they are immune to the violence,' he said.

Rules: Exceptions include the child being homeless, exercising their First Amendment rights or having written permission by a parent or guardian or being in their company

In 2012 more than 500 people were shot in Miami Dade County which reported just 42 percent of their homicides solved that year.

In the city of Miami, their police 
department solved 50 percent.

The national average of solved homicides is said to be 60-65 percent.

Among the number of exceptions to the curfew now in place are if the child is homeless and/or exercising their First Amendment rights - which includes freedom of expression and speech and right to assemble and to petition the government.

The exceptions also include written permission by a parent or guardian or if in their company.

The police department says that the 
enforcement is nothing new but in the past primarily only enforced 
during summer months when children are out of school.

They say it is not response to the series of recent shootings.

Miami police spokesman Willie Moreno noted spring break coming up as well.

'That's when kids tend to stay out later and later,' he told the Miami Herald of the students' time off from school.
