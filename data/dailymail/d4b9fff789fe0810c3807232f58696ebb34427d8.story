Devastating words spoken by the five-year-old boy whose parents were allegedly stabbed to death by his mother's ex husband reveals that the youngster has no comprehension that he will never see his parents again.

'Mummy and Daddy are dead and there’s blood everywhere,' the child told his neighbours, Nepia and Megan Kino, adding that his parents were going to the hospital to 'get sewn up'.

The gut wrenching words didn't end there with the orphaned boy saying: 'I’m going to take them to hospital to fix their cuts so they can get better,' The Courier Mail reported. 

The boy, who was found wandering the family home at Upper Coomera on the Gold Coast just after 5.30pm on Wednesday by his aunt who located the two bodies, may have been in the house for an entire day before the gruesome discovery.

The parents of a five-year-old boy were found dead inside the family home at Upper Coomera on the Gold Coast just after 5.30pm on Wednesday

The 39-year-old woman and 43-year-old man were found dead inside this suburban Gold Coast home. Police say the house will remain a crime scene for at least a week 

Police believe the victims, Renee Carter, 39, and her partner Corey Croft, 43, were stabbed to death in the home at around 8pm on Tuesday evening. 

The boy was consoled by a detective outside his home on Skylark Street dressed in a blue forensic suit believed to be used when someone may have evidence on their body, the Gold Coast Bulletin reports.  

Christopher Robert Carter, 36, has been charged with murdering the pair and didn't speak or show any emotion during a brief appearance at Southport Magistrates Court on Thursday.

Regional crime co-ordinator Detective Superintendent David Hutchinson confirmed that Carter is the ex-husband of the woman who was killed. They have been divorced for seven years, according to Nine News.  

Supt. Hutchinson said a knife was used in the double murder of Ms Carter and Mr Croft and that the woman's sister found the pair when she visited the house after being unable to make contact. 

Police believe the boy was asleep at the time and are confident he did not witness the deaths. He did however spend the following day in the home with his parents' bodies.

Police are now searching another premises for possible bloodied clothing and have appealed for anyone who saw a white 1999 model Mitsubishi Pajero four-wheel drive in the area over the last week to come forward.

Supt. Hutchinson said the boy was not involved in the fatal incident and was unharmed. He is being cared for by relatives after speaking with police.

'You would understand that a five-year-old child being inside the house under those circumstances would have to be very traumatic,' Supt Hutchinson said.

'You've just got to hope at the end of the day that he's young enough to minimise the impact on him.' 

A 36-year-old man has been charged with two counts of murder after the bodies of a man and woman were found at property in Upper Coomera on the Gold Coast just after 5.30pm on Wednesday

A neighbour said he heard arguing coming from the family home on Tuesday night but it stopped when he went to investigate. 

It's believed the family signed a lease on the home six months ago.

Tony Smales, another neighbour, told the Gold Coast Bulletin the household was the most family-orientated on the street.

'They had the entire place lit up for Christmas with giant Santas and reindeer, so it just blows you away to see something like this happen,' he said. 

Carter made no application for bail and has been remanded in custody.

The matter has been adjourned until March 27.
