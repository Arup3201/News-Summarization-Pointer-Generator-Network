Callous: Abdul Sajid, 18, pictured at Liverpool Crown Court during his trial, was convicted of three rape offences and jailed for eight years

A teenage student was subjected to a terrifying gang rape at the hands of three young men who threatened her with a knife and filmed part of her ordeal on a mobile phone.

The unsuspecting 19-year-old had gone to the home of Ammar Zahoor to chat and 'chill' with others she knew, but suddenly found herself alone with the 18-year-old and his friend Osman Ali, 20.

When the teenager tried to leave she was threatened with a knife and forced to perform a sex act on both men. At the same time one of them spoke to another friend, Abdul Sajid, on the phone and told him to come around to the house in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, for 'some fun'.

The victim, who is white, was then 
taken upstairs and repeatedly raped by Sajid, and later by Ali and 
Zahoor, in a protracted attack she described as a 'living nightmare'.

Sentencing
the trio to a total of 24 years, Judge John Phipps said mobile phone 
footage of part of the attack 'demonstrated the callous way in which the
defendants went about these offences and the pack mentality which 
accompanied them.

'Whether 
or not the events were planned before she got to the house, what 
happened to her after she arrived at the house amounted to a protracted,
frightening and humiliating ordeal for her. She was treated with 
contempt,' he said.

'It was
a group attack, a sustained attack, and the offences involved keeping 
her in the house against her will and threats of a knife.'

Ali, 20, who was described as the 'ring leader' at Liverpool Crown Court, was sentenced to eight and a half years imprisonment.

Sajid, 18, was sentenced to eight years, and Zahoor, also 18, to seven and a half years.

Sajid, of Dover Street, was convicted of three rape offences after a trial. Both Ali, of Corbett Street, and Zahoor, of Norman Road, pleaded guilty to two offences of rape.

A charge of false imprisonment against all three men, which they denied, was ordered to lie on the file.

All of the men, none of whom had any previous convictions, were put on the Sex Offenders Register for life.

'Pack mentality': Sentencing Ali, Zahoor and Sajid at Liverpool Crown Court, Judge John Phipps said they treated the 19-year-old victim with 'contempt'

Judge Phipps described the victim as 'open, good-natured and pleasant', but said she had had difficulties with her academic studies and was more vulnerable than other girls her age might have been.

Liverpool Crown Court was told the 19-year-old had gone to Zahoor's home - where she had been before without incident - at about 5.30pm on February 1 this year. She had been invited by a friend and when she arrived the guests also included three other young women.

When the others left left the victim tried to leave too, but Ali told her she 'wasn't going anywhere', said Stephen McNally, prosecuting.

Ali pushed the girl onto a sofa and ordered her to perform a sex act on him and Zahoor. When she refused Ali threatened to get a knife and kill her. Zahoor produced a knife from the kitchen and the terrified victim did as she was told, the court heard.

Mr McNally said footage of part of the attack filmed by Zahoor on a mobile phone 'showed Ali treating her contemptuously, laughing...and texting.'

Sajid then arrived at the house and joined in the attack having spoken to Ali on the phone.

The victim, who wept throughout her long ordeal, was eventually allowed to go home, where she told her sister what had happened. Her sister told their mother and the police were called.

Patrick Buckley, defending, said the men 'took advantage of a situation which presented itself and it very quickly got out of control.'
