A teenage couple from Oregon have been arrested and charged with a suspected hit-and-run crash that killed an 11-year-old girl and her 6-year-old sister, who were struck while playing in a heap of fallen leaves. 

Capt. Mike Herb said Tuesday night that detectives arrested the female driver and a male passenger from the vehicle police believe was involved in the Sunday night crash. Both are 18.

Herb said Cinthya Garcia Cisneros, of Forest Grove, was arrested for investigation of failure to perform a driver's duties to an injured person. Police say she was behind the wheel of the car at the time of the fatal crash.

Mario Echeverria, of Cornelius, was arrested for investigation of evidence tampering and hindering prosecution.

The Multnomah County medical examiner's office says 11-year-old Abigail Robinson succumbed to her injuries Monday night. Her step-sister, Anna Dieter-Eckerdt, was pronounced dead at the scene.

Police said earlier it's possible the driver didn't realize children were in the leaves that were piled in a greenway outside their home and partially into the street.

Tragedy struck just before 8.30pm Sunday while Abigail, known to her friends as Abby, and Anna were playing in a pile of leaves outside their home in the 1700 block of Main Street in Forest Grove.

Police said a car operated by Cisneros struck the two girls and drove off without stopping to check on the victims.

The girls' father, Thomas Robinosn, was taking pictures of his daughters and went indoors to put the camera away when the accident took place, Fox12 reported.

Dieter-Eckert died on the scene. Her older sister was airlifted to Legacy Emanuel Medical Center in Portland, where she passed away just before 11.30pm Monday.  

More than 300 friends, family and neighbors came together at Sonrise Church for an emotional  candlelight vigil in honor of the two young victims, the station KATU reported.

A makeshift memorial appeared outside the grieving family’s home in Forest Grove, with people leaving flowers, balloons, stuffed animals and handwritten condolence notes, including one addressed to 'Sweet Anna.'

Abigail Robinson was in the sixth grade at Tom McCall Upper Elementary. She had just been chosen to play a part in the musical ‘Annie’ at the Theater in the Grove.

Her step-sister, Anna Dieter-Eckert, was a first-grader at Dilley Elementary. The local station KGW said that grief counsellors have been made available at the girls’ school to help students and staff deal with their loss. 

Mr Robinson has declined to speak publicly about his daughters’ tragic death, only saying that the family is devastated. 

Robinson family spokesman Chad Toomey 
said the girls were sensitive, expressive and full of love. Abigail’s 
organs were donated to help others. Toomey said the 11-year-old would 
have wanted it that way.

‘Our girls lived a love-drenched life,’ the heartbroken parents said in a statement released to OregonLive by Toomey Tuesday. ‘We know where they are now. They are together in perfect peace with our Creator.’

Natasha Rae Kujawa, a recent Forest Grove High School graduate and photographer, shared on her Facebook page her memories of Abigail, whom she had met in the local theater.

Kujawava described the 11-year-old as an outgoing and talented girl who loved singing and dancing. 

'I'm blessed that I got to know this little girl,' she wrote. 'My heart just aches about both the little angels.'
