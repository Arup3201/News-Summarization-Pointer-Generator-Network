'Totally unacceptable': Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said it was 'clear' that actions taken Serco staff needed to be investigated by police

A private security company faces a police investigation after the Government uncovered potentially fraudulent behaviour in its multimillion pound prison escorting contract.

Serco employees allegedly recorded prisoners as having been delivered ready for court when in fact they were not, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said.

The figures are a key performance measure for the £285million contract.

The contract, which covers prison transfer services in London and East Anglia, has been put under administrative supervision with immediate effect.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: 'It’s become very clear there has been a culture within parts of Serco that has been totally unacceptable, and actions which need to be investigated by the police.

'We have not seen evidence of systemic malpractice up to board level, but we have been clear with the company - unless it undertakes a rapid process of major change, and becomes completely open with Government about the work it is doing for us, then it will not win public contracts in future.

'The taxpayer must know that their money is being properly used.'

Both the MoJ and Serco’s directors have asked City of London police to investigate the actions of the staff working on the prison escorting contract.

The Government department said differences between Serco’s records of contract performance and the actual situation on the ground has been subject to investigation for some months.

Evidence of potentially fraudulent 
behaviour emerged as part of the audit work announced by Mr Grayling in 
July in the wake of an electronic tagging scandal, in which G4S and 
Serco were both accused of overcharging the Government for monitoring 
offenders.

The time at which
prisoners are made available for legal visits, prior to being delivered
to the courtroom dock, is a key measure of Serco’s performance on the 
contract, the MoJ said.

The latest investigation into Serco comes in the wake of allegations that taxpayers were charged tens of millions of pounds for ‘phantom’ electronic tags on criminals who were either dead, in jail or had left the country.

The private security firm and its industry rival G4S are both accused of wrongly billing for tens of thousands of tags which had either been removed or simply never fitted.

Estimates suggest up to one in six of the 18,000 tags the Ministry of Justice was billed for every day were not real.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling in July took the dramatic step after pledging to recover ‘every last penny’ owed to the public purse as he asked fraud investigators to prove the scandal.

He told MPs the scandal could date back as far as 1999, when tagging of criminals began in England and Wales. Since then the taxpayer has spent £1billion on tagging and monitoring offenders. The current contracts began in 2005.

Mr Grayling at the time condemned the overcharging as ‘wholly indefensible and unacceptable’. In some cases, bills were paid for months or years after tags were taken off, he said.

The process of getting a prisoner from the prison van to the point where they are ready for legal visits can be lengthy, as they have to go through comprehensive security checks and processing.

The audit findings suggest some Serco staff have been manipulating their performance figures.

In light of the new findings, Serco have agreed to repay all past profits made on the prison escorting contract and to forgo any future profits.

The FTSE 100 giant has told the MoJ that no member of the board had knowledge of the allegedly fraudulent practice.

The annual contract value is £40.7 million, with the current projected contract value over seven years at £285 million.

Chris Hyman, chief executive of Serco Group, said: 'The Justice Secretary is right to expect the highest standards of performance from Serco.

'I am deeply saddened and appalled at the misreporting of data by a small number of employees on the contract.

'This is a very serious matter for the customer and for us. We will not tolerate any wrongdoing and that is why we have referred this matter to the police.

'It is also why I have immediately initiated a programme of change and corporate renewal.

'The overwhelming majority of our people work hard every day to deliver important public services and will share my deep concern about this matter.'

Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: 'Everyone wants to see proper rehabilitation but, if the 'rehabilitation revolution' means handing shed loads of money to apparently untrustworthy private companies, it will be a disaster for the taxpayer and for the criminal justice system.

'It's not too late for the Ministry of Justice to deliver rehabilitation reform by driving up standards and building on best practice in probation, prison and voluntary services.'
