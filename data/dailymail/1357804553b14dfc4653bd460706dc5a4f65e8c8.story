A lobby group that supports publicly funded universal health care has claimed that under the federal government's proposed changes to Medicare the average upfront cost of a 15-minute consultation with a GP could exceed $100 within two years. 

The Doctors Reform Society says Tony Abbott's government's plan to reduce the Medicare rebate for doctors by $5 and freeze it until 2018 is promoting a 'return to a failed privatised system of the past'.

The Newcastle Herald reported that the cost hike is likely to be the case with doctors free to charge what the market will bear in the future. Society national president and GP Con Costa said extending the current two-year-long freeze on Medicare rebates for another four years would hit GP clinics' budgets hard.

Tony Abbott's government's plan to reduce the Medicare rebate for doctors by $5 and freeze it until 2018

It's a move that would drive many doctors away from bulk-billing and into increasing their fees for patients who do not have concession cards. In 2012, the former Labor government froze the Medicare rebate for a standard "Level B" consultation of up to 20 minutes at $37.05. 

The Australian Medical Association (AMA) recommends GPs charge $75 for such consultations, meaning patients without concessions are usually out of pocket $37.95. But Dr Costa told The Newcastle Herald that because some doctors were already charging $80, it was likely some would be charging at least $100 by 2016.

Under the government's new proposal, if a doctor charges $100 up front, a non-concession patient would receive a rebate of $32.05, leaving them out of pocket $67.95.

'We're predicting a rapid rise in the cost to see a family doctor,' Dr Costa said.

'Up until now, Medicare and high rates of bulk-billing have kept a lid on doctors' fees and charges in general practice. Once you destroy this cost control, you basically open Pandora's box.'

The AMA has always argued that Medicare rebates for GPs' work have not kept up with inflation and average weekly earnings.
