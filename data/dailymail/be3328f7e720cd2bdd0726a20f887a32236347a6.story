Wilfried Zaha, it's time to sink or swim.

Don't just be another teenage prodigy who fell by the wayside. Become a superstar. You're capable.

That's what those around the forward should be telling him.

Wilfried Zaha must take his chance at Crystal Palace or his Manchester United career will be over

Zaha has struggled to adapt to life at Manchester United after moving for £15m in January 2013

From being one of the most sought after young players in Europe, Zaha has fallen off the radar.

Sir Alex Ferguson's final-ever signing hasn't lived up to his billing. Of course - he still has time on his side.

He arrived at Old Trafford in January 2013 as the premier young talent in British football.

What United found, however, was a player who wasn't even ready to train with United's expensively-assembled squad on a daily basis.

Those in and around Carrington during the first few months of his United career would speak of Zaha's struggles with the intensity of training sessions.

The fear with elite young players is that if they leave their nest too early in search of more glamourous surroundings, their development can be affected.

That certainly seems the case with Zaha.

Did he leave Crystal Palace too early? In hindsight, yes.

Having helped the Eagles to top-flight promotion under Ian Holloway, the benefits of playing regularly in the Premier League would have been invaluable.

But by the time time Kevin Phillips' penalty booked Palace's return to the big-time, Zaha's move north was already completed.

There was no turning back. Except that Zaha has been forced to go back.

With no place in Louis van Gaal's plans at Manchester United, the winger has found himself back at Selhurst Park on loan until the end of the season.

There were early signs of that old Zaha sparkle, scoring on his second debut for the club in a 3-3 draw at Newcastle.

However, he hasn't netted since.

Having worked so hard to bring him back to Selhurst Park, the man who first discovered Zaha, manager Neil Warnock, benched the forward for the final two matches of his reign.

Zaha's end product, or rather a lack of, was a major concern for Warnock and his coaching team.

Getting into good positions, the forward would often over-hit crosses, try one too many tricks or simply chose the wrong option.

It's key to remember, of course, that those blistering Zaha performances that made him the talk of England's scouting network were in the Championship.

Since stepping up to the biggest league of all, he has struggled to make an impact.

But now, under new Palace manager Alan Pardew, there is renewed hope for Zaha.

In Pardew, the 22-year-old knows he has a manager who believes in him, who wants to work with him.

The manager tried to sign Zaha during his time at Newcastle United, recognising his talent as a potential match-winner.

'I really like him, I have always liked him, I enquired about him when I was Newcastle manager a couple of time and could not get him,' admitted Pardew following Saturday's win over Tottenham Hotspur.

'I wouldn’t say that he has been lost. When you go to Manchester United it is very, very difficult.

'He has come out on loan and perhaps it has not gone as well as he would have liked. You would expect that a little bit. He needs to get that confidence.'

Having started Pardew's first game in charge - the comfortable 4-0 FA Cup third round win over Dover - Zaha was back on the bench against Tottenham.

But in his 17-minute cameo, Zaha provided tangible evidence that the magic in his speedy feet remains.

He was excellent, running at defenders with the pace, power and trickery that forced Ferguson to fork out £15million for him.

'His performance against Spurs will do him no harm and we need to build on that cameo,' said Pardew.

'If he plays like that for 90 minutes he will get in every week. He has done himself no harm.'

There was a time when Palace fans would chant: 'He's just too good for you'.

Well, Wilf, it's time to prove it.
