Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal does not rate Luke Shaw, according to former Old Trafford coach Rene Meulensteen.

Left-back Shaw became the world's most expensive teenager when he was signed from Southampton for £31mmillion this summer but has not yet appeared for United.

Asked if he believes that Van Gaal does not rate 19-year-old Shaw, Meulensteen told talkSPORT: 'Yes. It’s a big surprise for me.

'He would have been informed by the club that they were putting this bid in for Shaw because he’s an up-and-coming player.

'He’s got a good left foot and a lot of pace. He’s got a lot to learn to get to a Man United level though.

'He’s a great prospect but he’s brought [Marcos] Rojo in, which is bad news for Shaw.'

Meulensteen's comments come just days after United defender Jonny Evans claimed that Shaw will be the best left back in the world.

'I had the chance to work with Luke in pre-season and there is no doubt he is going to be the best left back in the world,' Northern Irishman Evans told United Review.

Shaw joined United on in June from Southampton, the club who awarded him his first professional contract.

His form last season earned him a place in England's World Cup squad at the expense of Ashley Cole. He played in the draw against Costa Rica.

Shaw's non-appearance for United may be down to the fact that Van Gaal has questioned his fitness since he came back in the summer.
