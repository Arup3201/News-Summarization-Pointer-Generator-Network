A business executive was sacked for having a visible tattoo on her foot.

Jo Perkins, 38, had long had the butterfly design on the side of her left foot when she started working for multi-million pound firm Salisbury FM earlier this year.

But months after she started work, bosses brought in a ‘no tattoos on show’ rule – and terminated Miss Perkins’s contract when she found it difficult to cover up her inking.

Controversial: Jo Perkins's butterfly tattoo on her foot which she says is only visible when she wears dresses

Given the boot: Jo Perkins, who lost her job apparently because of a butterfly tattoo

She is now considering launching legal action for discrimination.

Miss
 Perkins said: ‘I’ve worked for many high-level companies in my time. 
But I have never heard anything as ridiculous as this.’

She
 is not the only businesswoman to display a tattoo. David Cameron’s wife
 Samantha is often photographed with her dolphin inking visible on her 
right ankle.

Miss
 Perkins started working for the facilities management company – which 
has HM Revenue and Customs as its sole client – at its offices in Milton
 Keynes, Buckinghamshire, after being recruited through an agency and 
employed on a contract.

She was not dealing with the public and says she was praised for her ‘outstanding’ work during her five months with the firm. 

Consultant Ms Perkins was forced from her
 post with facilities management company Salisbury FM Ltd after falling 
foul of a tough new 'no tattoos' rule introduced in June

There is no law protecting employees from being dismissed or not being engaged for work because they have a tattoo.

In addition the Equality Act expresses that tattoos are not protected from disability discrimination as a severe disfigurement.

It states: 'Tattoos and body piercings are not severe disfigurements that are treated as having a substantial adverse effect on the ability of the person concerned to carry out normal day-to-day activities.'

Employment lawyer Nicholas Lakeland, who works for London law firm Silverman Sherliker, said that it was unlikely Miss Perkins could take any legal action as she had been working under contract for an agency.

He said: 'From the facts, it sounds like a very harsh decision and an unfair one, actually. But obviously their policy is: "No one with tattoos works for us".'

After hearing about the anti-tattoo policy, Miss Perkins says she sought advice regarding her inking.

Miss
 Perkins said: ‘The only way to cover it would be to wear a sock. I’m a 
businesswoman and I wear smart dresses to work, so that would look 
stupid.

‘I suggested covering it with a sticking plaster, but thought that would look unprofessional and draw attention to it.’

Things
 came to a head this week when she arrived at work and managers told her
 they had instructions that she be escorted from the premises. She later
 discovered her contract had been terminated.

Miss
 Perkins said: ‘I am consulting a solicitor, on behalf of all 
professionals with tattoos, to see if this action constitutes 
discrimination under inclusion and diversity laws.’ 

The
 company’s chief executive Ed Swales said there was no ban on staff 
having tattoos. ‘The policy is simply one of covering tattoos,’ he 
added. ‘The policy is in place to ensure our employees and contractors 
project the professional image we want our customers to see in 
Salisbury. [Miss Perkins] made no effort to comply with the policy.’

Company
 spokesman Graham Sievers added: ‘The policy on tattoos was launched in 
June and all the line managers made everyone fully aware of it. Her 
tattoo was visible. It is not a ban on tattoos. It is a ban on visible 
tattoos.

‘She was not marched off the premises, but asked to leave because she refused to comply with the company policy.’

Bare truth: Ms Perkins' left foot and her tattoo

Employment
 lawyer Nicholas Lakeland, of Silverman Sherliker in London, said that it was
 unlikely Miss Perkins could take any legal action because she had been 
working under contract for an agency.

He said: ‘Because she is not an employee, they can pretty much get away with it because it is not a discrimination type thing.

‘If they were getting rid of her because she was a woman, there are all sorts of extra protection.’

It
 comes a year after mother-of-three Joanne Stronach, 40, was sacked from
 her post in a Yorkshire department store after customers complained 
about a tattoo on her arm.
