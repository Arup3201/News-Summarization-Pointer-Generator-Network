Travelers facing canceled flights and closed roads were hoping to finally head to their holiday destinations as a widespread snowstorm that dumped more than a foot of snow in parts of the Midwest moved across the Great Lakes towards Canada.

The storm, that began in the Rockies earlier in the week, led airlines to cancel and delay thousands of flights and caused whiteout conditions that left roads dangerous to drive on. It was blamed for deaths in at least five states, with parts of Iowa and Wisconsin hit with more than a foot of snow.

While some people went to work on 
digging themselves out even as the storm continued today, others had 
less control as they waited for word of new flight times.

Across the U.S., 757 flights had been canceled and 10,911 delayed by Friday evening, according to FlightStats.com.

Most of the canceled flights were in 
Chicago, where more than 350 flights have been called off at O'Hare 
International Airport and more than 150 at Midway International Airport.

Southwest Airlines, which canceled 
all of its flights out of its Midway hub after 4.30pm on Thursday, was 
anticipating normal operations on Friday morning in Chicago.

United Airlines also planned to 
operate a full schedule, though officials for both airlines cautioned 
travelers to check their flight status before heading to the airport.

The storm made travel difficult from 
Kansas to Wisconsin, forcing road closures, including a 120-mile stretch
of Interstate 35 from Ames, Iowa, through Albert Lea, Minnesota.

Iowa and Wisconsin activated National Guard troops to help rescue stranded drivers. In Iowa, two people were killed and seven injured in a 25-vehicle pileup.

Drivers were blinded by blowing snow
and didn't see vehicles that had slowed or stopped on Interstate 35 
about 60 miles north of Des Moines, state police said. A chain reaction 
of crashes involving semitrailers and passenger cars closed down a 
section of the highway.

Three other states also had traffic 
deaths that were blamed on the storm. There were at least two deaths in 
each Nebraska and Wisconsin, and one in Kansas.

On the southern edge of the storm

The flight cancellations were getting
a lot of attention because the storm came just a few days before 
Christmas. But Daniel Baker, CEO of flight tracking service 
FlightAware.com, called it 'a relatively minor event in the overall 
scheme of things'.

By comparison, airlines canceled more
than 13,000 flights over a two-day period during a February 2011 
snowstorm that hit the Midwest. And more than 20,000 flights were 
canceled during Superstorm Sandy.

While snow pulled down most power lines in 
Iowa, others were felled by big gusts, said Justin Foss, a spokesman for
Alliant Energy, which had 13,000 customers without power in central 
Iowa.

'The roads have been 
so bad our crews have not been able to respond to them,' Foss said. 'We 
have giant four-wheel-drive trucks with chains on them so when we can't 
get there it's pretty rough.'

Utilities
reported more than 33,000 customers without power in the Des Moines 
area, more than 36,000 outages in eastern Nebraska and more than 41,000 
without power in Arkansas, where thunderstorms took out lines. Smaller 
outages were reported in Alabama, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois and 
Louisiana.

Meteorologist Scott Dergan said the snow cover would drag temperatures much lower in Nebraska and Iowa.

'We're talking single digits,' Mr Dergan said. 'We may even see some sub-zero temperatures in Nebraska.

This cold weather will stick around 
for several days, maybe until the day after Christmas. So we're 
definitely going to have a white Christmas.'

Forecasters
said the heaviest snow could be expected across a swath extending from 
northwestern Missouri into Milwaukee, Chicago and Michigan, with 
predictions of as much as a foot of snow in some areas.

Before the storm, several cities in the Midwest had broken records for the number of consecutive days without measurable snow.

The
weather service warned of poor visibility due to driving snow in much 
of the region and warned drivers to stay off roads in some areas.

Transportation officials shut down parts of Interstate 29 in Missouri 
early on Thursday, and Interstate 80 in Nebraska remained closed due to 
blowing snow.

'Just north of Interstate 80 is where the heaviest band of snow set up,' Dergan said.

'We're just seeing a few flurries 
this morning, but because of the wind, travel is pretty treacherous, 
especially into Iowa, as the storm moves east.'

In southeastern Wisconsin, where a 
blizzard warning was in effect and winds of up to 45 mph were expected 
to create whiteout conditions, sheriff's officials said slick conditions
led to at least two fatalities late on Wednesday when a driver lost 
control of his car in Rock County, about 90 miles northwest of Chicago.

In southeastern Utah, a woman who tried 
to walk for help after her car became stuck in snow died on Tuesday night. Search and rescue crews on snowmobiles found her buried in the snow just
a few miles from her car.

Chicago commuters awoke on Thursday to 
heavy fog and cold, driving rain, and forecasters said snow would hit 
the Midwestern metropolis by mid-afternoon.

Most of the canceled flights were at Chicago's O'Hare and Midway international airports. Aviation officials said Thursday night more than 350 flights had been canceled at O'Hare and more than 150 at Midway. Many people at O'Hare were taking the cancellations in stride and the normally busy airport was much quieter than normal Thursday evening.

Southwest Airlines canceled all of its flights at its Midway hub that were scheduled for after 4.30pm, and American Airlines said it was shutting down its O'Hare operations after 8pm.

There also were delays, most 
involving smaller regional planes that have more flight restrictions, 
spokeswoman Andrea Huguely said.

'We
are trying to delay as much as we can, instead of canceling, because we
know that we have many customers who are trying to make their holiday 
travel plans,' Huguely said.

Hundreds of schools across the affected region canceled classes on Thursday because of heavy overnight snow. Kansas City Power & Light reported about 16,000 scattered power outages in northwest Missouri and northeast Kansas.

The moisture was welcome to farmers in the drought-parched region, but Meteorologist Kris Sanders said the storm wouldn't make much of a dent. In Kansas, for example, some areas are more than 12 inches below normal precipitation for the year.

'It's not going to have a big effect, maybe only a half-inch of liquid precipitation. It's not helping us out much,' Sanders said.

Sanders said another storm similar to the current one could bring additional snow on Christmas or the day after.
