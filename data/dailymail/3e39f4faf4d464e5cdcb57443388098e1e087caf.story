Four ambulances and an air ambulance were rushed to Pembroke School in west Wales after seven pupils fainted

Seven schoolchildren were rushed to hospital today after taking a legal high during their lunch break.

Four ambulances and an air ambulance were called to treat the teenagers when they started to faint after returning to classes at Pembroke Comprehensive School in west Wales.

Detectives are now examining samples of the unnamed drug.

A Dyfed-Powys Police spokesperson said: 'The ambulance service informed us of an incident they were dealing with at Pembroke Comprehensive School.

'A group of pupils had become unwell.

'Officers attended the scene and established that a number of pupils were affected.

'Some were treated at the scene and 
released but others were conveyed to the Accident and Emergency 
department at Withybush Hospital in Haverfordwest as a precaution.

'None are believed to be in a life threatening condition.

'Early indications are that the group may have reacted to a type of legal high.'

The incident comes just a month after 
one of the Prime Minister's most senior drugs advisors said children 
need more lessons on the dangers of legal substances.

Parents of the 1,500 pupils at the comprehensive school have been informed of the incident and urged to warn their children against such drugs.

Police said none of the children were in a life-threatening condition.

A Pembrokeshire County Council spokesman said the school had now launched an independent investigation into the legal high incident.

He said: 'It appears these students have taken some kind of legal high.

'Seven felt unwell and were conveyed to Withybush Hospital.

'Ambulances attended as a precaution.

'The incident happened just after 2pm. Their condition is not life-threatening. Parents have been informed.

It comes a month after a senior government drugs advisor warned children are 'uneducated' about drugs

'The school is now launching its own investigation into the matter.'

Last month, Professor Simon Gibbons, a member of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, said a broader drugs education was needed

The father-of two said his elder daughter, aged ten, was already ‘starting to be aware of some of these materials’.

His comments raised concerns among parents who do not want their children exposed to such advice or who would prefer to handle the issue at home, with many calling for immediate action.

Campaigners blame more than 50 deaths a year on legal highs, including Adam Hunt, 18, of Southampton, and Hester Stewart, 21, of Brighton.

Ministers have already introduced bans on some legal highs, including mephedrone — known as meow meow — NBOMe and Benzofury.

A ban on synthetic stimulant mephedrone came into force across the UK in 2010.

The drug is now a Class B substance, along with its associated compounds.

Earlier this year the Mail revealed that there had been a huge surge in the number of deaths from other legal highs.

Ninety seven people were found dead with the substances in their system in 2012, up from 12 in 2009.

It means the toll has risen by eight times in three years. In around two-thirds of cases, the post-mortem examination established that the legal high was the direct cause of death.

A Home Office-appointed review is expected to report in late spring.

A new national curriculum being introduced in September states that pupils in year six at primary school – those aged ten and 11 – must be taught to ‘recognise the impact of diet, exercise and drugs and lifestyle on the way their bodies function’.

It states ‘pupils should learn how to keep their bodies healthy and how their bodies might be damaged – including how some drugs and other substances can be harmful to the human body’.

They should also explore ‘the relationship between diet, exercise, drugs, lifestyle and health’.

Although Personal, Social and Health Education lessons remain non-compulsory, the Department for Education recommends schools use them to expand the knowledge pupils get in science classes.

Guidance endorsed by ministers says primary pupils should be taught ‘which, why and how commonly available substances and drugs (including alcohol and tobacco) could damage their immediate and future health and safety, that some are legal, some are restricted and some are illegal to own, use and supply to others’.

Further guidance commissioned by ministers contains a series of standards for delivering drugs education in schools, including that ‘the situations, language and images are appropriate for pupils’ maturity, understanding and knowledge’.

Education minister Liz Truss answered a Parliamentary written question last month on drugs education in schools.

Asked by Tory MP Andrew Rosindell what steps the DfE was taking ‘to ensure children are taught about the harmful effects of drugs’, she said: ‘Pupils will learn about the effects of drugs on behaviour and health as part of the new science national curriculum from September 2014.

'Teachers can also cover the issue through PSHE lessons.’
