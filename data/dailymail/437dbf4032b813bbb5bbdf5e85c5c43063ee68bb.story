A mother has told of her three-day ordeal with her daughter when they became lost in the middle of the Australian Outback, saying they had to survive on leaves from gum trees and lit fires from an aerosol can.

Tammy Reiss, 41, and Karlee-May Durnan, 16, had to continue their journey from Haasts Bluff to Alice Springs on foot after their four-wheel-drive became stuck as they tried to cross a body of water.

They were 40 kilometres from their starting point and 200km west of their destination.

The pair were driving to Alice Springs so Karlee-May could catch a flight back to Queensland and return to school after the holidays. 

Northern Territory police raised the alarm on January 9 when they had not been heard from after two days.

But drawing from her Girl Guides training, Ms Reiss and Karlee-May survived the 10-kilometre hike from their stranded vehicle by sipping water off gum leaves and finding an aerosol can on the side of the road to light their fires at night.

The mother was a Girl Guide and used that experience to survive, drinking water off gum leaves

The mother told NT News she and her daughter got little shut-eye on the first night as they were 'petrified by the dark'.

'But as soon as daylight came through [after the first night] I said to Karlee "Right, go and get that deodorant", and she replied with "Mum you’re never going to light a fire",' Ms Reiss said.

'I said "mate, I’m a Girl Guide from way back" - and I sprayed the can and lit it.'

But Ms Reiss advised people against lighting a fire in this fashion as 'they could blow their heads off'. 

Adding to their terror, the pair said a wild bull started tracking them for about three kilometres of their trek.

'By this stage we had a huge bull that was following us, zig-zagging back and forth across the road and occasionally letting out a loud "moo",' Ms Reiss said.

As for keeping their energy up, they came pretty close to eating bugs if they had not been found on the third day of their trek.

'There is sugar on gum leaves so we got some energy from that, but if worse came to worse we would have been eating the grasshoppers.'

The mother and daughter were saved when a stranger drove past them when they had walked 10 kilometres from their 4WD.

They were taken to Glen Helen Resort, 138 kilometres west of Alice Springs, where they enjoyed their first meal in three days and two nights - a steaming hot, homemade pizza.

The pair went missing after they left Haasts Bluff - almost 230 kilometres west of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory
