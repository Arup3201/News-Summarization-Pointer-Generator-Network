At first, the passing soldiers checking a route in Afghanistan yesterday thought they might have come across an improvised explosive device.

But it soon became clear that inside a bundle on the roadside was an abandoned newborn baby girl, alive and wrapped in a towel.

The Polish troops on patrol near their Waghez military base took the two-day-old to a medical centre at the base - and called her Pola, after the name of their country.

Discovery: Polish soldiers were shocked to discover the baby girl when they arrived to disarm a road side bomb near Waghez, in Afghanistan. They named her 'Pola' after their country

Barren scene: Polish soldiers stand by the location the baby was discovered. Troops were concerned the bundle was a bomb before they discovered her wrapped up inside it

Attention: Medical staff gave the baby a thorough checking over after she was brought back to the Polish military hospital

She was examined by military doctors 
after the shock discovery on Wednesday - and soldiers were sent to buy 
baby formula, a bottle and a bib.

No other people or buildings were found within a one-mile radius, and it was unclear who had left the baby there and why.

When they first saw the bundle, the soldiers were suspicious as it was in a country where hidden roadside bombs are prevalent.

The troops planned to hand her over to Afghan paediatricians and authorities.

Attention: Military personnel look on as baby 'Pola' is treated. The baby was lucky to be found alive

Tests: Pola is checked with a stethoscope during the check-up at the hospital. She was found to be in good health despite her ordeal

Hungry: The baby appears to be given fluids to help rehydrate her by medical staff

Vulnerable: The tiny baby could have died if she had not been found by the soldiers

Their find happened on the same week that a British servicewoman gave birth in Afghanistan, after not realising she was pregnant.

The woman, who is originally from 
Fiji, had a healthy son at Camp Bastion on Tuesday. Both mother and baby
are in a stable condition and will be flown home in the coming days.

A
specialist medical team from the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford was 
due to arrive in the Helmand Province base to help take them home.

That
birth took place just four days after the camp was attacked by Taliban 
insurgents who destroyed six aircraft and killed two US Marines.

Safe: Pola appears contented as she sucks her thumb while wrapped in a warm towel

Cute: Two men take a look at baby Pola following her discovery by Polish troops. It is not known who her parents were or why she was left by the side of the road

Care required: When they first saw the bundle, the soldiers were suspicious as it was in a country where hidden roadside bombs are prevalent (file picture)
