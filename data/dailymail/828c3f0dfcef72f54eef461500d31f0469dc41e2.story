The local community has remembered Ms McLoughlin as having 'the biggest smile'

Anna Doyle, who works at a local child care centre used by Ms McLoughlin, said the Wolvi community was devastated by her loss.

'She had the biggest smile and a beautiful face,' she told the Brisbane Times.

'It's really shaken us a lot. We're only a small childcare centre and we do become close to the families. You live their lives with them.'

Jay Arthur wrote a moving tribute to his 'longest and dearest friend' Kirra on social media.

'We grew up together and I was just a part of your family - and as you were an only child I became like your brother and we had so many defining and powerful moments in our lives together,' he wrote.

'You meant so much to me and am just devastated on what has happened to you. You deserved so much more and to watch your kids grow and to have this taken from you is beyond words.'

Mr Arthur promised to help Ms McLoughlin's young family

'I will watch them grown and help mould theyâ€™re personalities into amazing humans beings - as your family and yourself did for me. I love you and will forever love you, and I know you will be with me always.'

Friends told the Brisbane Times Ms McLaughlin was separated from her husband and had been living with another man at the property where she was injured for the past eight months.
