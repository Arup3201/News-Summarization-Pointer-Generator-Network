Swiss cities Geneva and Zurich are the most 'liveable' places in the world, but London can only manage a lowly 22nd place.

This is according to a new study that has ranked the best places to live based on factors such as environment, economy, crime and culture.

Geneva and Zurich are followed by Singapore, Copenhagen and Helsinki, while bustling New York can only manage 17th and Tokyo is at 18th.

Moscow comes close to the bottom of the rankings at number 62 and Jakarta is the end of the list at number 64, according to the researchers.

The list was compiled by scientists from the National University of Singapore, University of California and Curtin University in Australia.

Instead of compiling a list of economic powerhouses, they created a measure of 'liveability' in major cities balancing work and social life as well as culture and sustainability.

They claim existing city lists often fall into two categories; the first includes those that put a higher value on cities based on economic-financial prowess.

1. Geneva

2. Zurich

3. Singapore

4. Copenhagen

5. Helsinki

6. Luxembourg

7. Stockholm

8. Berlin

9. Hong Kong

10. Auckland

The second ranks cities based on their having a pleasant living environment, a mild climate and a scenic locale.

This list, published in the journal World Review of Science, Technology and Sustainable Development, aims to combine the two.

Factors taken into account include economic vibrancy and competitiveness, domestic security and stability, socio-cultural conditions, public governance, environmental friendliness and sustainability.

'The rank of a city today is not necessarily a good indicator of its rank in the future,’ the report said.

'Environmental restoration and transport infrastructure improvements already underway in many Asian, and specifically Chinese cities, could see the higher liveability today of European cities outstripped as those developing cities develop further.'

London (pictured) didn't make it into the top ten. In a separate study, the number of people saying they were satisfied with their life in the UK dropped one per cent, from 59 per cent to 58 per cent, in the last seven years.

A separate list published last week found people from rich countries like Britain are happier than citizens of poorer nations.

The list was compiled by scientists from the National University of Singapore, University of California and Curtin University in Australia.

Instead of compiling a list of economic powerhouses, they created a measure of 'liveability' in major cities balancing work and social life as well as culture and sustainability.

Factors taken into account include economic vibrancy and competitiveness, domestic security and stability, socio-cultural conditions, public governance, environmental friendliness and sustainability.

Nearly 60 per cent of people living in the UK rate their happiness as at least a seven out of 10, higher than most other rich countries.

However, some wealthy nations, including France and Japan, are still miserable, with barely half of their citizens happy with their lives.

Morale has dropped slightly in the UK, the report by the Pew Research Center, in Washington, found.

The number of people saying they were satisfied with their life dropped one per cent, from 59 per cent to 58 per cent, in the last seven years.

Germany saw a rise of 13 per cent in the same time, possibly because Germans were less affected by the economic downturn than other Western nations.
