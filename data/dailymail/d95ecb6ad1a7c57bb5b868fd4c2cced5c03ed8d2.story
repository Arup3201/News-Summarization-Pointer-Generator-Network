A 3-year-old girl from Florida spent 30 hours hiding alone scared in her father’s closet and bed after she saw him get shot 19 times in the stairwell of his Philadelphia apartment building.

Armone Stanley, 34, and his daughter, Aryana, had been preparing to leave for Philadelphia International Airport on Wednesday after she spent two weeks visiting him.

Stanley, who had a lengthy criminal record in Florida, had been ambushed by an unknown gunman while walking down the stairs with Aryana’s pink Hello Kitty suitcase and shot dead on the second-floor landing.

The girl was discovered curled up in his bed on Thursday, hungry and traumatized, after her worried mother, Anna Caddieri, 24, from Hollywood, Florida, called the landlord of the otherwise unoccupied building near 49th and Arch Streets, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

Traumatised: The 3-year-old girl from Florida, Aryana, spent 30 hours hiding alone scared in her father¿s closet and bed after she saw him get shot 19 times in the stairwell

Ambushed: Armone Stanley, 34, and his daughter, Aryana, had been preparing to leave for Philadelphia International Airport on Wednesday when he was shot 19 times

Motherly love: Anna Caddieri, 24, from Hollywood, Florida, left, with her daughter Aryana, who she had sent to see her father in Philadelphia for two weeks

Past arrest: Stanley has a crime-ridden past. He was arrested in 2010 with three others for being a member of an identity theft ring

The landlord found Stanley’s bullet-riddled body in the stairwell and then discovered the little girl.

Cassieri flew to Philadephia late Thursday but child welfare officials only permitted the mother to see Aryana for 10 minutes on Thursday and two hours on Friday.

‘I told her I would come back, but she was yelling, kicking and hollering, asking why she couldn't go with me,’ said Cassieri. ‘I couldn't explain it. It was heart breaking.’

Officials from Philadelphia's Department of Human Services (DHS) said they had to hold the child in protective custody for 72 hours to investigate the case.

Saturday morning, a judge ordered the agency to immediately release Aryana to her mother's custody.

In a statement, DHS officials said they ‘fully support’ the judge's decision to return Aryana to her mother, adding that they had kept her in temporary care because of an initial lack of information on her case.

‘DHS has to take all the facts into consideration in assessing the safety of children in our care,’ the statement read.

Reunited: Mother and daughter together again after 72 hours apart after the horrific ordeal in which Aryana's father Stanley was shot 19 times and she hid terrified for 30 hours alone

Cassieri said the whole ordeal ‘felt like I was in a nightmare’.

‘I'm never coming back here. I don't want anything to do with Philadelphia ever again.’

Stanley's South Florida relatives said they are mystified by his killing.

‘He was a good man. He loved his kids,’ said Marlon Bryant, 29, his brother. ‘He was a big brother to me. He didn't have any trouble with anyone.’

In 2010 Stanley was arrested with three others for being a member of an identity theft ring in Bucks County, according to ABC 6 Action News.

Police at the time said they recovered 35 driver's licenses, 53 credit cards, 50 personal checks or checkbooks, and a number of cellular phones and iPods.

Murdered: Stanley, 34, was ambushed and shot dead in the stairwell of this apartment building in Philadelphia

Police said there are between 90 and 100 victims from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and as far south as Florida.

Stanley was arrested along with Earl Johnson, 31, Ronnie Lodge, 22, and Javaris Williams, 23. Police say all four men were from the Fort Lauderdale area of Florida.

Homicide detective Lt. Philip Riehl said the gunmen who shot Stanley on Wednesday had stood over him and ‘emptied a gun into him’, according to the Sentinel.

Philadephia police Officer Jillian Russell said Monday that no arrests have been made in Stanley's death.
