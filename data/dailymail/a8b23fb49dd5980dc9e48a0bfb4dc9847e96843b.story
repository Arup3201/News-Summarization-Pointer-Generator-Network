Emergency services used ropes and specialist equipment to free the man

Paramedics had to rescue a man who fell down a 10ft manhole and injured his back.

Emergency services were called after members of the public spotted the man, believed to be in his 30s, below the pavement and appealing for help at around 10pm at night on Sunday.

An ambulance crew and medics from the Hazardous Area Response Team were forced to use ropes and specialist equipment to free the man on a main road in West Bromwich, the Midlands.

He was treated for back pain before being taken to nearby Sandwell General Hospital.

A spokeswoman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: 'On arrival at the scene crews found a man who had fallen into a manhole.

'Using specialist equipment the man was extricated from the hole and was treated at the scene for back pain. 
'The man, believed to be in his 30s,
was fully immobilised before being conveyed to Sandwell General 
Hospital for further assessment and treatment.'

Earlier this year a dog walker fell down a manhole which had been left exposed after thieves stole the cover.

Matthew Walters, 34, suffered neck and back injuries and remained stuck down the hole in Dudley for several hours before being rescued.
