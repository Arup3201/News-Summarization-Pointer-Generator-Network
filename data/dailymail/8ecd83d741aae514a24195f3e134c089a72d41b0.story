Britain's first live TV advert was broadcast on Channel 4 last night which saw Sam Smith promote Google Play with a live performance at Camden Roundhouse.

Millions tuned in to see him perform his number one single Stay With Me during an ad break on last night's Alan Carr's Chatty Man.

The performance lasted three and a half minutes and came from his sold out gig at the London venue.

Sam Smith performed at Camden Roundhouse last night, which formed part of the UK's first ever live TV ad

'It's incredible to be part of a UK first,' Sam said of the live performance. 

'Stay With
 Me being broadcast live to the nation will be a very special moment for
 me.

'I’m
 beyond words with happiness right now. My first ever album is finally 
here. Thank you to all my incredible fans who have helped me get here. 
Please listen and love, ‘In The Lonely Hour’,' Sam declared on his web 
blog.

Google UK's Azi Eftekhari said 'We're so delighted Google Play Music, Sam and his millions of fans could be a part of music and TV history. Google Play's all about connecting music lovers with the tracks and artists they love.'

The ad was broadcast on Channel 4 during an ad break of Alan Carr's Chatty Man programme

The idea is thought to have originated from a close collaboration between Channel 4, Google Play, MediaCom, Universal Music label Capitol, BBH and Essence.

Sam's album, The Lonely Hour has only just been released already music bosses want him to be looking ahead at writing material for the follow-up.

The source said: 'Sam's such a great talent the people around him don't want him to get caught up in that hard partying scene, which is why they've been insistent that he gets back to the studio to carry on working on his music.

'Plus, it has the added bonus of keeping him away from any bad influences that may distract him.'

The gig at the London venue was a sell-out but broadcast to millions during a live ad break

Despite his new found fame and busy social life, Sam, who celebrated his birthday last week, previously claimed his record is about being a lonely 21 year old, and thanked fans for changing his life over the past few years.

He said: 'I truly hope you love this album. I hope it is the soundtrack to all of those lonely moments. It helped me through mine'.

Sam also announced on Tuesday that he will be playing a concert at London's prestigious Hammersmith Apollo in November.
