Manchester United player Marcos Rojo has sparked widespread anger after posting a picture of notorious Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar on a social media site.

The Premier League defender posted a photo of Escobar on his Instagram page on January 3 along with a quote attributed to the drug baron, who was linked to thousands of deaths during the bloody drug wars of the 1980s and 90s.

Instagram users have now lashed out at the 24-year-old, branding him 'ignorant' and suggesting supporting Escobar was like supporting violence.

Rojo's Instagram post (pictured) featured Pablo Escobar and a quote which translated to: 'The only people I will let eat at my table are those who go through hunger with me and never bend at the bad times in life'

Despite the uproar, the picture remains on Rojo's (pictured) Instagram page and attracted 700 comments

The quote below the picture of Escobar reads: 'The only people I will let eat at my table are those who go through hunger with me and never bend at the bad times in life.'

While the quote on its own could be interpreted as harmless, attributing it to Escobar prompted fury.

One Instagram user stated it was 'incredible' the Argentinian - who earns £200,000 a week - had posted the picture, saying it was disrespectful to all Colombians who still suffered from the bloody drugs wars Escobar triggered.

At the height of his criminal enterprise, Escobar was believed to be worth a staggering $3billion.

His wealth was almost entirely generated through large scale drug smuggling, primarily to the U.S., where his Medellin cartel was responsible for 80 per cent of the cocaine distributed throughout the country.

Jaime Ortega said: 'S***** Argentines. They dignify Escobar because they didn't suffer the decades of pain our country experienced,' The Sun reported.

Andres Gonzalez added: 'Simply seeing Escobar's picture is enough to generate disagreements because of the deaths he caused.'

Despite the uproar, the picture remains on Rojo's Instagram page and continues to generate fierce debate.

The 24-year-old transferred to Manchester United in the summer for a fee of £16million from Portuguese team Sporting Lisbon.

Born in 1949, Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria started his criminal career on the streets of Medellin in Colombia as a teenager, selling contraband cigarettes and stealing cars.

When he was gunned down by Colombian National Police on December 2 1993 he was one of the wealthiest criminals in history, worth a staggering $30billion.

After working for a short time as a bodyguard in the early 1970s Escobar moved on to cocaine trafficking. His operation became so successful that he was able to buy 15 planes and six helicopters to help smuggle the drugs, mainly to the United States.

Escobar amassed so much cash that he had to spend around $2500 a month on rubber bands to keep the piles of notes neatly stacked.

His Medellin Cartel inevitably attracted the attention of the authorities, but Escobar dealt with them mercilessly. He either bribed them or had them assassinated, which is where the likes of John Jairo Velasquez came in.

Escobar was eventually gunned down in 1993 by Colombian police, who found him in a middle-class home in Medellin, with the help of U.S special forces, after a 15-month-long investigation.

He was shot while trying to escape across nearby roofs with his bodyguard, Alvaro de Jesus Agudelo, who was also shot and killed.
