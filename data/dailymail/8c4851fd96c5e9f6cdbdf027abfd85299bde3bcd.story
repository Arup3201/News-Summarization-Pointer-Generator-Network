Visiting Santa Claus in his grotto either at a shopping mall or department store is an annual holiday tradition.

Children and their families stand alongside Father Christmas for a photo after telling him what gifts they are hoping to see under the tree.

But those looking to get their festivities off to more of a bang this year can head to a Georgia gun range - where patrons can pose alongside Kris Kringle while holding a firearm of their choice.

Wish for weapons: Sandy Springs Gun Club in Georgia is inviting families along to hold a firearm of their choice during a photo shoot with Santa Claus

Sandy Springs Gun Club and Range has invited families to have their photo taken with Santa on Sunday.

Those in the frame will stand next to the festive figure and will be able to choose from a number of weapons - a pistol, an AK-47 and an FN-SCAR (an assault rifle used by the U.S. Special Forces). 

Co-owner Robyn Workman Marzullo told WSBTV that safety is their first priority.

'We’re not trying to treat guns like toys. It’s not trying to send a message. It’s just about having a good time, getting into the holiday spirit and giving back to the community.

'Our customers and the people who support us will love to do something different for the holidays.'

Only those over 18 will be allowed to hold the guns - which will be unarmed - in the photos. Children under the age of 12 will not be allowed into the range itself.  

In 2011, a gun club in Scottsdale, Arizona, did a similar thing. 

Toting the gun, and perhaps belts of ammunition around their necks, children smiled alongside a rather bewildered-looking Santa. 

A baby is also seen in one image grasping the end of an assault rifle alongside grinning parents.  

Aim: Co-owner Robyn Workman Marzullo has said the idea of the controversial campaign is to give something back to the community but insisted they were not treating guns like toys
