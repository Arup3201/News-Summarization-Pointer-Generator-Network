This is the tender moment when Pope Francis kissed a bandaged, poorly child in St Peter's Square at the Vatican during his weekly audience.

It was a poignant gesture that those watching found very emotional.

Every Wednesday, Pope Francis has made a habit of touring for approximately 30 minutes among the thousands of pilgrims who  attend the weekly audience, blessing and shaking hands with various groups of people, and often receiving gifts.

Several other children were also blessed by the Pope as he made his way around the Square including a little girl dressed in pink hat and a baby in a blue coat whose cheek he rubbed.

The pictures emerged following the Pope's declaration that dialogue with Isis should always be on the table. He said yesterday that while it was 'almost impossible' to have a dialogue with Islamic State insurgents, the door should not be shut. 

'I never say 'all is lost', never. Maybe there can't be a dialogue but you can never shut a door,' he told reporters on his plane returning from Strasbourg, France, where he addressed the European Parliament and the Council of Europe. 

'It is difficult, one could say almost impossible, but the door is always open,' he said in response to a question about whether it would be possible to communicate with the militants. 

Ultra-radical Islamic State has captured thousands of square miles (km) of territory in Iraq and Syria, beheaded or crucified prisoners, massacred non-Sunni Muslim civilians in its path and displaced tens of thousands of people. 

The Iraqi government, backed by U.S.-led air strikes, has been trying to push back Islamic State, although Shi'ite Muslim militias and Kurdish peshmerga have helped contain the Sunni insurgents and repelled them in some provinces. 

Pope Francis repeated comments made earlier this year that while it was legitimate to fight an 'unjust aggressor', this had to be supported by an international consensus.
