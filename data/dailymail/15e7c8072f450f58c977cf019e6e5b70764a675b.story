An owl in Minnesota is lucky not to have become a permanent hood ornament when it got lodged in the grille of a passing car.

Around 3:30am last Thursday, an owl was hunting along Highway 169 in Plymouth when it swooped down to catch its prey.

Stuck: Kenneth Love was surprised when a swooping owl struck his car in the early morning and became lodged in the grille

At that exact moment, Kenneth Love was passing through the area and their fates collided, as the bird was struck at the perfect angle and became lodged in the grille of Love's car.

After seeing the bird crash into the front of his car, he drove to a friend's house to try and pull the owl free with the help of some thick gloves.

Watching: Love said the bird watched 'every move' he made as he and a friend tried unsuccessfully to pull the bird free

He records video of the rescue attempt, but in spite of all their efforts, the owl still can't get break free.

Love tweeted that the owl 'kept looking at me every move I made while stuck' and told ABC the bird bit at him.

Finally, Love calls police, who covered the bird's head with a towel before finally pulling it free.

Love's own feathers were ruffled by the incident. He tweeted later: 'I don't care if I am a man. I'm just a city boy. Don't see this everyday.'

The bird was then taken to the Minnesota Raptor Center at the University of Minnesota in St Paul, where it's currently recovering. 

According to the center's weekly patient census, the owl joined seven other great horned owls, one screech owl and one long-eared owl.

This owl was lucky to be freed as quickly as it was.

Last year, the Huffington Post reported a woman in south Florida struck an owl while driving along the turnpike late at night.

She assumed she had killed the bird, saying that she didn't stop to check at the time because it was dark.

When she went out to run errands the next day, a family flagged her down, telling her something was caught behind her grille. 

As it turns out, the owl had simply fallen through the slats and become stuck, though it emerged from the incident unscathed.
