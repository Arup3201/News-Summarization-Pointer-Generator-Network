The days of drones needing to return to base to top up their batteries could soon be over.

An MIT student has shown off a prototype system allowing a craft to land on a power line and recharge itself.

The smart system uses the magnetic forces emitted by the lines to find the perfect place to perch itself.

The MIT prototype that can land of a power line and recharge itself. It uses magnetic sensors to find the perfect place to perch.

The system works using the power line's magnetic field.

Four metres away from it, sensors in the plane's nose sense it, and allow the plane to fly itself so it lands perfectly on the wire, exactly like a bird.

'Small and micro UAVs have enabled a number of new mission capabilities, including navigatingin and around buildings and performing perch-and-stare surveillance,' wrote Joseph Moore, a PhD. candidate at MIT, who is developing the system.

'However, one of the primary limitations of these small vehicles is endurance, simply because they cannot carry suufficient power for long missions.

However, Moore, who is a student at MIT's lab dedicated to developing small flying craft, realised that power was freely available - above the ground.

'Recent advances in xed-wing perching have made it possible to consider a new solution to this problem - landing on a powerline to recharge.'

The system works using the power line's magnetic field.

Four metres away from it, sensors in the plane's nose sense it, and allow the plane to fly itself so it lands perfectly on the wire, exactly like a bird.

As the plane approaches the wire, it raises its nose to allow it to 'perch' on the wire with clamps where wheels would usually be.

The U.S. Air Force is also working on a similar system, developing tiny unmanned drones that will fly in swarms, hover like bees, crawl like spiders and even sneak up on unsuspecting targets and execute them with lethal precision.

The Air Vehicles Directorate, a research arm of the Air Force, has released a computer-animated video outlining the the future capabilities of Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs).

The project, announced last year, promises to revolutionize war by down-sizing the combatants.

'MAVs will become a vital element in the ever-changing war-fighting environment and will help ensure success on the battlefield of the future,' the narrator intones.

'Unobtrusive, pervasive, lethal - Micro Air Vehicles, enhancing the capabilities of the future war fighter.'

One drone type soars like a pigeon and perches unobtrusively on a power line to observe a surveillance target with a camera.

The Air Force is working on technology that will allow the drones to steal electricity from power cables and other sources - so they can continue to operate for days or weeks on end.

Hovering: Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) are the future of the unmanned drones program, according to a new video from the Air Force. The Air Force has already developed a drone capable of hovering like a moth

Perching: The video, released by the Air Vehicle Directorate, shows a pigeon-like drone that can draw power from an electrical wire while its camera watches a target

Crawling: The drones will be equipped with legs so that they can crawl through tight spaces like an insect

The project, which is based at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, was revealed in the March issue of the National Geographic magazine.

Air Force officials said they have already produced tiny remote-control prototypes - but they consume so much power that can only operate for a few minutes. Researchers estimate that it will take several years of advances in battery technology to make the designs feasible.

Still, the Air Force has a clear concept of what it hopes to accomplish with the program.

The promotional video begins with a swarm of tiny drones be dropped on a city from a passing plane. 

The drones will work in concert to patch together a wide, detailed view of the battlefield - singling out individual targets without losing sight of the broader scene. 

'Data will be communicated among the MAVs to enable real time, reliable decision-making and to provide an advanced overall picture for other platforms or operators,' the Air Force says.

Killing: The video demonstrates how MAVs could be used to sneak up behind unsuspecting targets and kill them with a single, lethal shot

Lethal: The drones could be equipped with incapacitating chemicals, combustible payloads or even explosives 'for precision targeting capability'

As the drones fall, they begin to fly - not like planes, but like insects. High frequency flapping wings allow the drones to hover and maneuver in tight spaces.

The military has already produced a drone patterned after a hawk moth that can flap its wings 30 times a second.

However, the activity exhausts the drone's tiny battery in just a few minutes, according to National Geographic.
