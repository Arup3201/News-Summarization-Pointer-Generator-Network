A disturbed Delaware woman allegedly had sex with a dog in her home while her boyfriend photographed her.

Samantha L. Golt, 24, and James P. Crow, 25, were arrested on Tuesday, January 10, following an investigation into their heinous act, state police said.

The investigation began on December 28 when a concerned neighbor tipped off state troopers about the abuse of a canine, according to court documents.

Odd couple: The couple performed their disturbing act of bestiality in their home west of Milford, Delware

Troopers found that Golt had engaged in sexual intercourse with a dog in her home west of Milford, Delware, while her boyfriend Crow took photographs, said Master Corporeal Gary Fournier.

The date of offense was listed in court papers as occurring between 8am on August 31, 2012 and 1:12am on December 29, 2012, according to records.

Investigators compared Golt’s driver’s license photo with the photographs seized as evidence in order, Fournier said.

By doing so they were able to positively identify her, he said.

Golt and Crow were each charged with one count of felony bestiality and felony second-degree conspiracy.

The perverted couple were later released after posting $12,000 secured bail.

A state police spokesman said that the couple was issued a no-contact order with any animal during their initial court appearance on the charges.

Authorities said a local SPCA was notified at the time of the investigation, and that no animals were removed before charges were filed this week.

Beth Butts, Kent County SPCA spokesman, told Delaware State News that a bestiality charge is rare, and the shelter ‘feels like any level of animal abuse is absolutely abhorrent.’

‘Animals need to have protection the same as children do in that they are innocent and can’t defend themselves,’ she said.

Butts said that domesticated animals build up a level of trust with their owners and can be more vulnerable to abusive attacks.

‘If you have a dog or any other pet that trusts you and you begin hitting or kicking it or committing any kind of abuse, they will not bring much of a defense because they’ve been under your protective, trusting care for a period of time,’ she said.

‘They think you’re supposed to be supporting their needs, not abusing them, and don’t react like they should to an attack.’
