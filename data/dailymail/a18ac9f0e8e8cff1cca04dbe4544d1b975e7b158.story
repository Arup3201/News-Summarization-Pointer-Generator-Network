Yoga is hard enough as it is - without balancing your partner on top of you as you struggle to hold that downward dog.

But friends Brian Aganad and Arthur Cadre decided to do just that, by performing contorted poses together.

They filmed this video at a yoga centre in Palo Alto, California, where both work at Avalon Art and Yoga Centre.

The pair can be seen moving into the difficult full lotus - but they make the move even harder by balancing on top of each other.

They work through a sequence of acrobatic moves, relying on each other for support.

'Couples yoga' has become increasingly popular in recent years.The practice has been touted as a great way to bond with your significant other.
