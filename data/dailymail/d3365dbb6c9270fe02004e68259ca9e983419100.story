Carlo Ancelotti has said it is 'an honour' to take his Real Madrid side to Anfield ahead of Wednesday night's showdown between the Spanish giants and Liverpool.

The Italian's star player Cristiano Ronaldo knows all about England's rainy climate having played for Manchester United for six years.

Ronaldo and his team-mates were forced into training in the pouring rain on Tuesday as they prepared for their Champions League encounter against Liverpool.
