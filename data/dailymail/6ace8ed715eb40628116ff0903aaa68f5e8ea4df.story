The fertilizer plant which exploded in Texas on Wednesday, claiming as many as 15 lives and injuring nearly 180 more, was previously fined for failing to have a proper risk management plan, it has emerged.

West Fertilizer Co., a family-run business that employs a dozen people in West, was fined in 2006 by the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to have safety systems that met federal standards.

After implementing the plan, the company told the agency that, even 
though they held 54,000 of ammonia at the plant, it was 'no' risk of a fire or an explosion occurring there.

The company 
said the 'worst possible scenario... would be a 10-minute release of 
ammonia gas that would or injure no one', an EPA report reveals.

With their claim now proved tragically 
wrong, questions are emerging over exactly what caused the deadly blast -
and what the owner, Donald Adair, and his employees could have done to
avoid it.

In further potential failures, the Dallas Morning News
reported that only six fertilizer plants in Texas have been inspected 
by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the last five 
years.

And yet more reports suggest OSHA is so understaffed that they can only carry out such checks every 129 years, the Morning News reported.

Speaking to CBS11, Mr Adair, a church-goer who also owns a grain distribution center in West, said he had no idea what had sparked the fire on Wednesday.

He said he was sitting at home when he learned of the blaze and then 'things just blew up'. When he went to the scene, he was pushed back by emergency responders, he said.

The plant, which Adair has owned for 
around seven years, had been closed for around three hours at the time 
of the explosion, and none of the 12 employees were there at the time, 
he said.

Speaking to the Star-Telegram, his son, 
53-year-old Gary Adair, said he heard the massive explosion as he was 
working on the family farm.

'It felt like an extra loud sonic boom 
out in the country,' the younger Adair said. 'I hadn't heard a sonic 
boom since I was a kid. About 30 seconds later, it dawned on me what it 
was.'

He said his father is too distraught to 
talk and that neither of them understand what caused the initial fire as
machinery is never left on.

'Everybody in town basically knows 
everybody,' Adair said, his words soon dissolving into sobs. 'It's 
really rough. It's a tragedy.'

Proximity: Inspectors noted how close the plant was to schools and homes but said it did not pose a danger. But in February the school was evacuated after staff noticed a fire at the plant

A letter sent to parents of children 
at West Intermediate School, which is across the road from the West Fertilizer Co. plant, 
reveals that the school was temporarily evacuated because of a 
'concerning fire' in February.

'The evacuation was executed in calm, but serious fashion,' it said.

The letter noted that the school had 
not been notified ahead of time that the plant had been carrying out a 
controlled burn, so the principal had called 911.

The school asked for better communication with such notifications.

West Fertilizer Co. was cited for failing to obtain or to qualify for a permit in 2006.

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality investigated West Fertilizer on June 20, 2006, after receiving a complaint of a strong ammonia smell.

Agency records show the person who lodged the complaint said the ammonia smell was 'very bad last night' and lingered until they went to bed.

Later that summer, the plant was fined by the Environmental Protection agency for failing to have a risk management plan that satisfied federal standards, WFAA reported.

It was issued with a $2,300 penalty on August 14, 2006, records show.

Further documents from November 2006 show that the West Fertilizer Co. agreed to meet all standards expected for anhydrous ammonia storage tanks.

Among the changes, it promised to hold an internal inspection once every day to make sure there were no ammonia leaks, and that it would build a wall between tanks and the road to avoid collisions.

It noted the gas would be stored in two 12,000 gallon permanent storage tanks, and that staff would only fill the tanks to 85 per cent capacity

Denial: Mr Adair's company had told federal safety agencies that there was 'no' risk of a fire at the plant

Devastating: The family will be facing tough questions over what caused the fire - and as many as 15 deaths

In subsequent reports, inspectors noted the proximity of the plant to schools and homes - without passing any judgment on the safety of this.

'There are two schools located within 3000 ft of this facility, however, the impact potential is described by the region [regional Texas Commission on Environmental Quality office] as low,' a 2007 report noted. 'The nearest off property receptor, a residence, is 350 ft from the plant.'

The cause of Wednesday night's explosion remains under investigation, but officials said they had not ruled out criminal activity.

The explosion occurred at 7.50pm as volunteer firefighters responded to a fire at the plant. Three to four firefighters are unaccounted for, and officials believe between five and 15 could have died.
