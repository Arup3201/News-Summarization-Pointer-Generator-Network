Since making her 1959 debut, Barbie has done stints as an astronaut, a surgeon, a news anchor and even a U.S. president. And ever the Renaissance woman, the leggy blond doll has found a new calling: entrepreneur.

Entrepreneur Barbie, which Mattel unveiled at the American International Toy Fair in February, is available on Amazon starting today, and will hit other retailers in August.

Mattel has teamed with eight female entrepreneurs to launch the tech-savvy doll, who comes equipped with a tablet, a smartphone and a laptop 
case.

Barbie's 'Chief Inspirational Officers' include Girls Who Code founder Reshma Saujani, One Kings Lane founders Susan Feldman and Alison Pincus, and Rent the Runway founders Jennifer Hyman and Jenny Fleiss.

'Unfortunately we live in a culture where girls are bombarded with images of male coders and engineers that just don’t look like them,' Saujani told Wired.

'When you ask a girl what a computer scientist is, she usually pictures a geeky guy typing away. And then we wonder why girls don’t pursue careers in tech! We have to change popular culture and start showing more women, more cool, dynamic, creative women, in these roles.'

The campaign's participants offered career tips to young fans in a Twitter discussion Wednesday afternoon, using the hashtag #BarbieChat. Barbie will also get her own LinkedIn page and a billboard in New York's Times Square featuring the hashtag #unapologetic.

Entrepreneur Barbie is part of Mattel's  'I can be' line of career-oriented Barbies, which launched in 2010 in an effort to showcase 
modern-day careers for women.

'She's ready to take on anything that comes her way,' Mattel spokeswoman Michelle Chidoni said earlier this year.

'We always try to make career Barbie
 a reflection of the times,' she added. 'Women entrepreneurs are more prevalent now and they’re 
growing in number. [It's] a great way to encourage girls to also learn 
about this role.'

It's the first time in her 55-year 
history that Barbie has taken on the role of business owner, where women are 'living their dreams their own ways.'

Chidoni said Mattel is also partnering with the Girl Scouts to create video stories of successful female entrepreneurs.

Barbie Entrepreneur comes in four ethnicities and will retail for $12.99, according to CNN.
