The house at 1600 Commonwealth Boulevard in Kenthorst, Pennsylvania, would make Martha Stewart - or any interior decorator - cringe. But Don Draper would feel right at home.

The two bedroom, two bathroom house is a Mad Men time capsule, preserved almost perfectly since its initial construction and design in 1965 - right down to the  tacky floral wallpaper in the kitchen and the sickening green bar with orange accents. 

Today, thanks in part to the hit AMC show about a 1960s ad agency, vintage is back in style. And 'time capsule houses' like the one on Commonwealth Boulevard are in demand.

A trip back in time: The orange-cream-yellow-and-green color scheme in the bar area of this home offers a trip back in time. It hasn't been updated since the house was built in 1965

Right at home: Don Draper, seen here on the first season of Mad Men, could very well have lived in the 1965 home

Sold: The two-bedroom, two bathroom home at 1600 Commonwealth Boulevard in Kenthorst, Pennsylvania, sold last year for $134,000

The home was purchased by a woman in her 40s who plans to preserve it as it is

This particular home was bought last September by a woman in her 40s. She paid $134,000 for the house - and plans to keep it exactly as it is, CNN reports.

'She was very artsy; she fell in love with it as soon as she saw it,' realtor Jeffrey Hogue, who specializes in selling vintage homes, told CNN.

The 1,600-square-foot house features a full bar with a color scheme that looks right out of any suburban refuge shown on Mad Men.

With striped cream-and-orange wallpaper, yellow shelves, a green bar and red stools, the design is unmistakable 1960s.

The home went on the market after an estate sale. Most 'time capsule homes' have had just one owner who never changed the interior design

Jeffrey Hogue, the realtor who sold the home, says demand is growing for vintage houses - thanks in part of shows like 'Mad Men'

The kitchen features a cream-and-brown color scheme (with floral wall paper) that would make Martha Stewart cringe

The kitchen features dark brown laminate flooring, floral-printed wallpaper on the ceiling and cream-and-brown cabinets.

Mr Hogue said homes like the house on Commonwealth Boulevard often have just one owner, who preserves the original look.

They usually don't go on the market until the original owner dies or goes into a nursing home.

Mr Hogue offered advice for owners of homes with out-dated design and interior: don't change them. Vintage homes are only attractive if they remain close to their original style.

'Leave it as it is. If it is not broken or completely worn out, leave it alone. Sell what you have, not what everyone thinks it should be,' he says.

He adds: 'Many purists want the property with all the original fixtures. Once they are remodeled to later standards, the purist is done.'

Mr Hogue recommends that owners of homes with a vintage look refrain from updating anything that isn't broken - an untouched time capsule home can actually sell faster than one that has new wallpaper

The home even includes a beauty salon, which was run by the former owner of the house. It comes with original styling chairs

The home is also furnished with mostly original furniture - adding to the vintage flair
