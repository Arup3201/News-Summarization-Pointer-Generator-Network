A former glamour model fears she's destined to be single forever - because no man will ever match up to her cats.

Tabitha Miles, 40, from Southend-on-Sea, Essex, is so crazy about her pampered cats that she spends an incredible £4,000 a year tending to them.

But men run a mile when Tabby (yes, really!) brings her two pets Wolfie and Foxy out on dates with her. She even insists they share her bed, no matter who else is in it.

Model Tabitha Miles fears she's destined to be single forever, due to her intense love of her cats Foxy (pictured) and Wolfie

Model Tabby has never had a proper long-term relationship - and claims it's because she can't find a man who will put up with her obsession.

She said: 'I love them so much - I think they might be Britain's most pampered cats.

'When blokes find out that they sleep in the bed with me and that they are with me all the time, they disappear.

'But if a man doesn't love my cats as much as I do, he's got no place in my life.

Spoilt cats Wolfie and Foxy live a life of luxury, sleeping only on goose-feather pillows and enjoying regular trips to the salon. Doting Tabby even takes them to restaurants on their birthdays.

She can't bear to be apart from the pair, and they even join the ex-Page Three girl at work on photoshoots.

Tabby says one guy she went on a date with called it quits when she said the cats sleep in the bed

Which means that no matter how many dates she goes on, she can't find the right man for her and her felines.

Lifelong cat lover Tabby bought female Birman Foxy and male Maine Coon Wolfie a year ago and has dedicated her life since to making sure they want for nothing.

At home they rule the roost, sharing Tabby's bed and refusing to let her shut any doors so they can have complete reign over the house.

Foxy likes the blinds opened as soon as it is light - meaning her owner rises at 4am every day to make sure her pampered puss can see out of the window.

Potential suitors have told Tabby they'd like to ask her out but won't play second fiddle to Foxy and Wolfie.

Others have refused to take the relationship any further than one date when they find out about her spoilt pets.

And although she was seeing one easy going guy for just under a year, they broke up when her constant comparisons between his young child and her cats became too much for him.

Just like a small child, Foxy and Wolfie are picky about their food and eat only the best in breed specific brands.

When they're not modelling for Tabby's artwork, she wines and dines them at restaurants and hotels where cat friendly waiters bring out bowls of water and the moggies sit on chairs at the table.

For Wolfie's first birthday Tabby threw a party complete with a cake and a stocking full of presents.

And Foxy's extra-long hair needs so much attention that she grooms her two to three times a day.

Tabby now mainly models hosiery, and regularly takes the cats to photo shoots with her where they get free rein to wander around the studio.

But if she goes to work for a day and they can't join her on shoot, they stay with her mother who calls Tabby so she can chat to them on the phone throughout the day.

Tabby even claims she has learnt to speak ‘cat' and says Wolfie can answer her with different types of miaows when she asks him a question.

Tabby said: 'The cats are my babies and because they have such a close relationship to me, that's too much for some people.

'I've been on lots of dates and when I've mentioned the cats, the reaction straight away hasn't been very good.

'But if they don't understand then I just refuse to go on another date with them.

'Who needs a man when I have Foxy and Wolfie's faces to wake up to every morning and they look forward to me coming home.

'I can imagine that people could find it a bit extreme but I'm not looking for a boyfriend at the moment anyway.

'There have been six blokes that I've been out with that have had to go because they didn't like the cats.

'Several guys have told me that they would ask me out but they don't want to be second best to two pets.

'I told one guy I went on a date with that they spent the night in my bed and he called it quits because he said he didn't want to sleep with Foxy and Wolfie.

'He actually said: ‘I don't want to go to bed with your cats.'

'I had one boyfriend that I went out with for just under a year and he had a young child. He got really annoyed because every time he said something about his child, I would compare it to my cats.

'Everything his child could do, my cats could do as well.

'Most dates just think I talk about them too much and that's too much for them.

'I can see how it could be a bit irritating but it's a case of "love me, love my cats".

'Everything I do for them is worth it - I don't mind ditching boyfriends and cutting nights out short because they come first.

'My cats live an unusual lifestyle but I love them so much I want to give them everything I can.

'They even come to the pet shop with me to choose the things they want.

'They do lunch in local bars and restaurants and they've very good and patient. They enjoy it.

'Although I'd love to, I'd never give them human food - it's so bad for cats and I only want the best for my babies.

'People dress up dogs and take them for walks so I don't see why it shouldn't be the same for cats.

'And because they're my darlings we celebrate their birthdays like we would one of my friends.

'They get a cake with their name on, a stocking full of toys and goodies as well as main present.'It's so nice to be able to treat them.

'It does all add up but they're totally worth it.

'People are often surprised when I arrive with them but because they're so happy and look so contented everyone just gets used to it.

'But Foxy and Wolfie come first. If they suddenly decided they weren't happy with the grooming or the walks or the clothes, I'd be the first to put it on hold.

'I guard them with my life - they're my darlings.'
