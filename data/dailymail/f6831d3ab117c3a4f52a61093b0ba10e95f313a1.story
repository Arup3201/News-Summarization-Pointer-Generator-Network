Laughter and jokes seemed to surround Lukas Podolski's trip to Borussia Dortmund for Arsenal's Champions League clash.

The German striker was in good spirits before the game, laughing with the Gunners' opponents in the warm up and signing autographs for local fans - but there was nothing funny about his cameo later in the match, at least from the forward's perspective.

With Arsenal already 2-0 down and heading for defeat, the 29-year-old was called on by boss Arsene Wenger to enter as a substitute - only for the his introduction to comically be delayed.

Podolski lost his shin-pad on the touchline and after a failed search under bibs and within the dugout, Mesut Ozil half-heartedly gave him his to take to the field around five minutes later in the 77th minute.

Podolski appeared in relaxed spirits ahead of the Champions League game against Dortmund.

The Arsenal forward was in conversation with Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp and defender Kevin Grosskreutz on the Signa Iduna Park pitch prior to kick off.

Podolski and Grosskreutz laughed and joked around as there was more than just three points at stake for the two Germans  - they had a wager on.

Podolski has struggled to make Arsene Wenger's first team so far this season, his only appearance coming in Arsenal's 1-1 draw with Leicester. 

The World Cup winner had a position on the substitutes bench for tonight's game.
