Matthew Dunford, pictured at an earlier court hearing, who has been found guilty of harassment at Hammersmith Magistrates Court today 

A fitness fanatic dubbed 'Britain's vainest man' set up a fake website claiming his Brazilian lapdancer former girlfriend was a prostitute because she wouldn't get back with him, a court has heard.

Image-obsessed Matthew Dunford attempted to extort £5,000 from Brazilian model Amanda Branco who once worked as a stripper.

When she refused to pay, the 30-year-old then mocked up the escort website profile and sent it to her mother and sister.

He was then charged with stalking and was awaiting trial but he still went on to Facebook to repeat the false allegations that Ms Branco was a call girl and linked it to her employer's page.

Today, Dunford of Westbourne Park, west London was found guilty of two counts of harassment without violence after he failed to turn up at Hammersmith Magistrates Court.

The court was told how Dunford had met Ms Branco in Ireland and they then went on to work at the same branch of Gymbox in Holborn, central London.

But when the six-month fling ended in October 2013, the personal trainer bombarded her with calls, texts and emails.

Ms Branco told magistrates: 'I went to Brazil for three months to get away from him.

'The day I got back - I don't know how he found out - he left me a voicemail screaming "are you back, are you back, are you back?"

'He kept asking me to meet him, he said he had problems with drugs and needed my friendship to move on and go back to the gym and move on my life. I was getting 30 calls a day.

'When I went to meet him he cried and cried on the street. I told him we couldn't be friends.'

Dunford, who claims he spends £10,000-a-year on his looks, then tried to blackmail Ms Branco, a former lap dancer from Rio de Janeiro, the court heard.

She said: 'In February 2014 he said he found out I wasn't just a stripper, [he thought] I was an escort.

'He started blackmailing me, saying he wanted £5,000 for what I did to his life.

'I felt scared and then he started saying if you don't reply, wait and watch what is going to happen.

'He said you have until midnight and he gave me an address for a hotel just five minutes from my house.'

Ms Branco ignored the sinister threats, but she added: 'He photoshopped a website saying I was an escort, he sent it to my mum and my sister.'

The World Beauty Fitness and Fashion World Championship contestant then called police when Dunford arrived her flat demanding to be let in - claiming he wanted to collect his nutritional supplements.

Dunford had previously been dubbed 'Britain's vainest man' after claiming he spends £10,000 a year maintaining his looks

Although she refused to let him into the building, she explained: 'He came up and my flatmate said ring the police.

'We told him. He said "yes you can call - say there is a very good-looking guy with blonde hair.''

Dunford was arrested, bailed and warned by police to leave Ms Branco alone but she continued to received hate-filled messages from someone called 'Family Destroyer'.

One read to the court said: 'You are evil. Look what you have done to a family and you still drag us through it.

'You could have stopped this months ago, you know you lied to the police. God sees everything.'

Dunford was first charged with harassment in May last year but he failed to show up to court two weeks later.

The bodybuilder eventually pleaded not guilty and had been due to face trial in September.

However while awaiting trial he continued to bombard Ms Branco over Facebook, publicly repeating his allegations that she was a prostitute.

She said: 'I'm a personal trainer, I'm self employed and if he messes up my work I don't get paid.

'He is destroying my work life and my family life. Luckily the gym managers know what is happening but the members saw this as well as my clients. He went too far.'

Dunford was arrested for the second time and had been due to stand trial today, but failed to turn up.

His lawyer Norman Cho said his client had been taken ill last night and taken to hospital near his parents' home in Milton Keynes, but added he was discharged a few hours later.

Ms Branco, a former World Beauty Fitness and Fashion World Championship contestant ignored the sinister threats but called police when he arrived her flat demanding to be let in

Magistrate Deidre Hopkins allowed the trial to go on without him because of his repeated failure to attend court.

Finding him guilty she said: 'It's worth noting that the defendant... was awaiting trial for these charges and on conditional bail, the condition not to contact the complainant.

'The course of conduct amounted to harassment and beyond reasonable doubt we find the defendant guilty of both charges.'

She also issued a warrant for his arrest.
