Five babies under the age of one have been diagnosed with measles at a suburban Chicago daycare center. 

Health officials are investigating the outbreak at the KinderCare Learning Center in Palatine and have already warned there will be more cases.

It is not yet known whether it has been linked to those infected at Disneyland or another case in the city last month.

Outbreak: Five children under the age of one have been diagnosed with measles at the KinderCare Learning Center in Palatine, suburban Chicago. Health officials warn there will be more cases 

The Cook County health department confirmed a resident over the age of 18 had been diagnosed last month and identified three areas where others could have been exposed.   

Those infected at the center, which a spokesman says had been thoroughly cleaned, are too young to have received the MMR vaccine. 

Everyone affiliated with the day care has been notified and anyone not vaccinated for measles has been instructed to stay home and away from unvaccinated individuals for 21 days. 

Terry Mason, the chief operating officer of the Cook County Department of Public Health, told the Chicago Tribune: 'There will be more cases. … We shouldn't be surprised about that. The cat is out of the bag.'

Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, said in a statement: 'These cases underscore the need for everyone who is eligible for the vaccine to ensure that they have been vaccinated. There are certain individuals who, because of their age or clinical condition, cannot be vaccinated.'

One adult in Illinois was recently diagnosed with measles. The diagnoses for the adult and two of the babies have been confirmed through laboratory testing, health officials said.

Precuations: A childcare worker helps a child off of a District 211 school bus outside of the daycare center. The school has told anyone who not vaccinated to keep them away for 21 days

Test results for the other three cases are still pending, but they have been diagnosed based on clinical and epidemiological criteria, officials said.

On the advice of health officials, the KinderCare center is excluding until Feb. 24 unvaccinated children and staff who may have been exposed to the virus, according to a statement from Knowledge Universe, KinderCare's parent company. The center was given a 'deep clean' on Wednesday night, the statement said.

Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease that causes fever, red and sore eyes, runny nose, cough and a rash. It can be fatal in some cases.

Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after decades of intensive childhood vaccine efforts.

The measles outbreak has renewed a debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement in which fears about potential side effects of vaccines, fueled by now-debunked research suggesting a link to autism, have led a minority of parents to not have their children inoculated.

Last year, the United States had 644 cases from 27 states, the most since 2000, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

Concern: Terry Mason, the chief operating officer of the Cook County Department of Public Health, said: 'There will be more cases. … We shouldn't be surprised about that. The cat is out of the bag.'
