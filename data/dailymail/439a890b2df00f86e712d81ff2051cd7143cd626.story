A Melbourne woman snubbed fad diets and turned down lap band surgery to lose almost 100kg the 'hard way' by drastically changing her diet and exercise six times a week.

Michelle Magniolo now weighs 75kg after tipping the scales at 172kg when she was just 17.

It took 20 grueling months to shed the kilos but Michelle said it needed to be done to avoid serious health issues.

'I needed to change my life because every day struggles were ridiculous and everything was so hard to do. Even getting out of bed in the morning I'd have back pain,' Michelle told A Current Affair.

'I was mentally exhausted, I was miserable and I didn't want to move from my bed.

'I got the letter saying I was approved (for lap band surgery), but I ripped the letter up and I thought I'm going to do this by myself.'

Michelle took on a mostly protein diet sticking to steak, chicken, fish, salad and vegetables, combined with exercise five to six times a week.

But she treats herself to anything she wants just once a week.

'I knew it was going to be extremely tough and I knew it was going to happen overnight,' she said.

'My entire life has changed since I did this.'

Michelle said she drinks four litres of water a day and she treats herself to anything she wants just once a week

Her parents Mary and Dominic stood by her throughout the gruelling regime and said she was headed down a frightening track had Michelle not chosen to fix her health.

'She had quite a few health issues… when you look at obesity, heart disease, diabetes – she was heading down that track,' Mary said.

'When I look at the photos now, I even have to ask myself was she really that big.'
