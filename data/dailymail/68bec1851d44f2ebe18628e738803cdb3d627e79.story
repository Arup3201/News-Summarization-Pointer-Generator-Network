Glaring menacingly from the window, a wild cat looks down on shaken pensioner Bruce Gough after going ‘berserk’ and attacking him in his home.

The tortoiseshell terror flew into a rage when Mr Gough, 74, tried to eject it with a broom after it had sneaked in through an open window.

It bit and scratched him, leaving him needing a tetanus injection at hospital, then raced around, smashing a treasured antique in its frenzy, before climbing up the curtains and refusing to leave.

An elderly couple have been left shaken after a wild cat broke into their home, attacked them and smashed valuable antiques - before refusing to leave

The tortoiseshell terror flew into a rage when Brian Gough, 74, tried to eject it with a broom after it had sneaked in through an open window

In desperation, Mr Gough and his wife Eileen, 77, shut it in the bedroom as they struggled to find a way to rid themselves of the feline intruder and avoid further catastrophe.

They called the RSPCA, but to their dismay the charity refused help because the demonic moggy was believed to be feral.

So, as their ordeal entered a second day, there it stayed, hissing… and probably thinking it had got the better of them.

But the creature had not reckoned on the intervention of neighbour Andrew Fox, 58, who came to the rescue - dressed in full motorcycle leathers to protect him from its teeth and claws.

After a brief chase Mr Fox managed to catch the animal before releasing it back outside, ending its 48 hour reign of fear in the flat in Chartham, Kent.

Retired aerospace engineer Mr Gough told how the drama began as he and his wife were watching television last Thursday.

He said: ‘I suddenly saw the cat standing in the doorway. It must have got in through a bedroom window.

‘When I got up, it dashed off into a spare bedroom and I found it hiding under the bed. I tried to coax it out but it wouldn’t budge, so I got a broom to ease it out.

‘But when I went to pick it up, it just flew at me and sank its teeth and claws into my forearm.

‘It was going berserk and flew around the room, knocking things over, including a Victorian ewer on the mantelpiece, which smashed.’

Retired nurse Mrs Gough said: ‘Unfortunately, the cat defecated and urinated in the room, which now stinks.

‘We shut the door and left it in there. Bruce’s arm was bleeding quite badly and I said he should go to hospital because there was a risk of infection.

‘The cat had clawed its way up curtains and sat on the edge of the sash window, and that’s where it was the following morning.’

It bit and scratched Mr Gough, leaving him needing a tetanus injection at hospital, then raced around, before climbing up the curtains and refusing to leave. But a motorbike-leather clad neigbour soon came to the couple's rescue and removed the cat

After the RSPCA said it could not help, the couple were instead given a cage trap by Canterbury Cats Protection in the hope they could tempt the cat down and catch it. But instead they had to turn to Mr Fox and his unorthodox, but effective, ‘cat-proof’ suit.

Mrs Gough said: ‘I was very surprised and a little angry the RSPCA wouldn’t help.’

Yesterday an RSPCA spokesman said: ‘This sounds like a very distressing incident for this couple.

‘The RSPCA is an animal welfare charity and our donors expect us to use our limited resources on animals who are suffering or in distress or danger. So long as a feral cat is healthy, he or she will live happily outside and so when we are busy we have to prioritise other animals who are in greater need of our help.

‘We would advise anyone who finds a feral cat has entered their home to keep a distance and ensure they have a clear and easy exit route - such as an open window or door - so they can make their own way out. The likelihood is a cat like this will be very scared to be shut in an alien environment and pleased to find a way out.

‘We support the trapping and neutering of feral cats where local charities have the capacity to do so.’
