For the victims of superstorm Sandy,
it is a hard day to be thankful when so many were left devastated by the loss of loved ones, their 
homes and businesses lying in pieces around them.

But like many times in the aftermath of the devastating storm, their fellow citizens rallied around, giving up their own Thanksgiving today to prepare meals and distribute supplies.

New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was reflective on Thursday as he praised police, firefighters, armed services personnel, 
sanitation workers and volunteers involved in the storm response.

His 
office was coordinating the distribution of 26,500 meals at 30 sites in 
neighborhoods affected by Sandy and other organizations were 
pitching in.

George
Alvarez, whose Toms River, New Jersey, home suffered moderate damage when 
Sandy hit the coast, said his family usually does 'the traditional big 
dinner' on Thanksgiving.

But this year, they chose to attend a community
dinner held at an area church.

'This storm not only impacted us, it 
impacted a lot of our friends, our community, our psyche,' Alvarez said 
shortly before his family headed out for their meal.

'We could have had our usual dinner 
here at home, but this year it felt like we should be with others who 
are experiencing the same concerns we are.

'We made it through this 
devastating storm, and that's something to celebrate.'

Disaster zones on Staten Island were brimming with food and volunteers from Glen Rock, New Jersey who 
organized using social media.

'We had three carloads of food,' said
volunteer Beth Fernandez. 'The whole town of Glen Rock pitched in. ... 
It's really cool. It's my best, my favorite Thanksgiving ever.'

Carol Gross, 72, a Long Beach native, said she went to volunteer
but was turned away because of a surplus of helpers.

'A lot of people like me, old-timers, we've never seen anything like this horror,' she said, recalling the destruction.

Gross' brother, Jerry, who moved to Arizona in the 1960s, was stunned by what he saw when he returned for Thanksgiving.

'To

Some victims of Superstorm Sandy were given front row seats to the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade after the store provided 5,000 tickets and transportation.

'It means a lot,' said Karen Panetta, of the hard-hit Broad Channel section of Queens, as she sat in a special viewing section set aside for New Yorkers displaced by the storm.

'We're thankful to be here and actually be a family and to feel like life's a little normal today.'
