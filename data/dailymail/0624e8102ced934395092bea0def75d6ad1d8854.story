A company has designed a water bottle that's ideal for the office worker’s bag - because it’s completely flat.

The same shape as a piece of paper, the Memobottle is a slimline, reusable water bottle that slides into your bag to lie next to books and laptops.

The reusable bottle, which can also be washed in a dishwasher, is designed to help reduce the number of plastic bottles in landfills.

A company has designed an ideal water bottle for the office worker's bag - because it's completely flat.  The same shape as a piece of paper, the memobottle is a slimline, reusable water bottle which slides into your bag to lie next to books and laptops

Creative duo Jesse Leeworthy and Jonathan Byrt, both 28, designed the bottle to be practical and environmentally friendly. 

It is made from a durable, dishwasher-friendly ‘green’ plastic.

All three Memobottles are 1.2 inches (30mm) thick and are designed to be as durable and robust as possible.

Leeworthy and Byrt from the Monington Peninsula near Melbourne, Australia say more then 600 billion single-use bottles were sold globally last year.

In America alone, studies show that around 1,500 single-use water bottles are consumed every second - and only 20 per cent of these are recycled.

And the cost of buying more and more plastic bottles adds up - the pair say that bottled water costs approximately 1,400 times more than tap water.

'We’ve always been passionate about the environment,' said Leeworthy.

The reusable bottle, which can also be washed in a dishwasher, is designed to help reduce the number of plastic bottles in landfills.

'For years we have been focused on creative design that provides environmental remedy while improving social convenience.

Earlier this year a trio of designers created an alternative to the plastic water bottle - a container made from an edible algae balloon.

Called Ooho, the spheres can be produced in different sizes, hygienically protect the liquid inside, and cost just 2 cents (less than a penny) each.

The design was crowned one of 12 winners of the second annual Lexus Design Award and is due to go on sale in Boston later this year.

'The Memobottle was designed to overcome two problems that we see in our society.

'Firstly our attachment to the outdoors and environment - we have always been disgusted with the overuse of singly use plastic bottles.

'We developed a passionate desire to reduce their usage and their disastrous effect on the environment.

'Secondly, throughout our schooling and university years, and to a larger extent our professional work life, we have been frustrated with the inability to fit water bottles in carry/laptop bags.

'Somewhere along the line, there has been a general consensus to design circular shaped bottles.

'Rather than making a product that fits into this category, we decided to create something that is easy to transport but still holds the functional aspects of traditional bottles.'

The bottle will be available in three different sizes - A5 which holds 750ml (1.3 pints), A4 which holds 1.25 litres (2.2 pints) and letter size which also stores 1.25 litres

The product is seeking funding on Kickstarter and has already soared past its primary goal of raising £8,310 ($13,500), reaching it in just 36 hours

Designer Jonathan Byrt said: 'The feedback we’ve received have been overwhelmingly positive!'

Jonathan Byrt said: 'The feedback we’ve received have been overwhelmingly positive!

'We knew we had a great product, but becoming fully funded on Kickstarter within 36 hours really validated the concept.

'The emails of support and interest, blog postings, and social media comments have been amazing - it’s been great to see people as excited as the Memobottle as we are!'

The product is expected to be on the market by Christmas and will be available for global delivery.
