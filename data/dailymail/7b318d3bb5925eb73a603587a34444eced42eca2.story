A woman whose five-day-old son was snatched from her home defended the half-sister now charged with kidnapping him, telling police: 'She wouldn't take my son!'

Authorities have released the tearful 911 call made by 18-year-old Brianna Marshall after her son Kayden Powell vanished overnight on Thursday from her home in Beloit, Wisconsin.

Prosecutors say her half-sister Kristen Smith was found with baby clothes and prosthetic pregnancy belly in her car - and had pretended to be pregnant.

Reunited: Brianna Marshall and Bruce Powell, pictured shortly after Kayden's birth, are back with their son

Smith, 31, was arrested when police stopped her at a gas station 170 miles away in West Branch, Iowa, apparently driving back to her home in Colorado.

Some 29 hours later a police chief discovered newborn Kayden, crying and wrapped in blankets in a nearby plastic storage bin.

He was alive and well despite having been left in freezing temperatures.

The newly-released 911 call reveals Brianna sprung to her half-sister's defence when the operator suggested she could be a suspect - despite Brianna waking up and finding Smith and the baby gone.

'My son is missing,' she told the operator through tears. 'He's like four days old... I put him to sleep in his crib and now he’s not there.'

Freezing: There was snow on the ground as Kayden lay in a bin at this gas station for up to 29 hours

A friend or relative of Brianna then took the phone and told the operator: 'Her sister was here earlier. Her sister’s gone and the baby’s gone.'

Brianna took the phone back and added: 'I called her, and she's balling her eyes out and told me to call the cops.'

Brianna: My son is missing.

Dispatch: How old is your son?

Brianna: (crying) He’s like four days old.

Dispatch: He’s what?

Brianna: He’s four days old.

Dispatch: Four days old?

Brianna: Yes.

Dispatch: Okay, was there forced entry into your home or where was your son?

Brianna: He was in his bassinet [crib].

Dispatch: Okay, who else is in the home?

Brianna: Me and my grandma, my boyfriend, and my uncle.

Dispatch: Okay, and no one has seen the baby?

Brianna: (crying) I put him to sleep in his crib and now he’s not there.

(later)

Friend: Her sister was here earlier. Her sister’s gone and the baby’s gone.

Dispatch: Okay was the sister there when she laid the baby down at 1:30am?

Friend: Yes.

Dispatch: Okay, so the possible suspect is her sister?

Friend: Yeah. Ain’t nobody else been here.

(later)

Dispatch: And you already talked to Kristen?

Brianna: Yes I called her and she’s balling her eyes out and told me to call the cops.

Dispatch: Okay, and she’s claiming she doesn’t have the kid, correct?

Brianna: No, she wouldn’t take my son!

Dispatch: Okay, alright. Is she going to be turning around and comingback to the house?

Brianna: Most likely.

Dispatch: Okay, I’ve got officers pulling up, have everyone not touch anything, okay? Wait for the officers to get inside the house. Okay?

Brianna: (crying)

The dispatcher replied: 'But she's claiming she doesn't have the kid, correct?'

A tearful Brianna said: 'No, she wouldn’t take my son!'

Authorities released the nine-minute recording after Smith was charged with kidnapping. She was originally held on an unrelated fraud warrant.

Smith, 31, is being held in her own cell at the Cedar County jail in Tipton, Iowa, while she awaits transfer to federal custody to face the kidnapping charge.

Cedar County Sheriff Warren Wethington said: 'I don't feel comfortable putting her in with the general population due to the circumstances and media coverage other inmates would have seen.

'Some of the inmates over there are mothers, sisters, nieces and aunts. I don't think it would be in the interest for her safety.'

The FBI alleges Smith took the boy from her half-sister's home in southern Wisconsin before 4.30am on Thursday, five days after Kayden was born, and began driving to Colorado.

After Marshall discovered the baby was missing and called police, an officer reached Smith on her phone while she was passing through Iowa and instructed her to stop for questioning.

An officer who met Smith at a gas station in West Branch, Iowa, found no sign of Kayden.

Smith repeatedly denied any connection to the disappearance, but she was taken into custody on a warrant from Texas charging her with tampering with government records and fraud.

About 29 hours later, the police chief found Kayden, who was reunited with his parents at an Iowa hospital. He has since been discharged in good condition.

After the discovery, the FBI claimed Smith admitted that she took the baby and put him there.

Investigators said they found online communications in which she falsely claimed to be pregnant or have given birth and a prosthetic pregnancy belly in her car.

Smith has an extradition hearing scheduled this Friday on the Texas charge, but authorities said they believe her next move will be to Wisconsin because the federal case will be awarded higher priority.

Cedar County Attorney Jeffrey Renander said Smith was 'not going anywhere' until federal prosecutors obtain an indictment for the kidnapping charge, possibly next week.

West Branch Police Chief Mike Horihan described the case to ABC7 as 'unique'.

'I
 have been in law enforcement for a while and nothing ever surprises me.
 But it's very unique and very special and I'm just glad everything 
seems to be fine,' he said.
