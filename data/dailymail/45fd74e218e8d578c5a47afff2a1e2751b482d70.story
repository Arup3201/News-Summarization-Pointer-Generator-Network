The mother of kidnapping victim Amanda Berry died of a broken heart before learning her daughter was alive, friends revealed today.

Amanda, now 26, escaped from the basement of a Cleveland home on Monday night with Gina DeJesus, 23, and Michele Knight, 32, who all disappeared from the same block ten years ago.

They were found with a six-year-old girl, who relatives confirmed Amanda gave birth to while held against her will at the home for a decade.

Amanda went missing on April 21, 2003 on the day before her 17th birthday - but her mother, Louwana Miller, never gave up hope that she would see her again.

But Miller, who had been hospitalized for months with pancreatitis and other ailments, died in March 2006 aged just 47, without ever learning that her daughter was alive.

She had spent the previous three years 
looking for Amanda, whose disappearance took a toll as her health 
steadily deteriorated, family and friends said.

In November 2004, she even turned to a psychic, Sylvia Browne, on Montel Williams' television show.

'She's not alive, honey,' Browne told her. 'Your daughter's not the kind who wouldn't call.'

But Councilwoman Dona Brady said she had spent many hours with Miller, who never gave up hope that her daughter was alive.

'She literally died of a broken heart,' Brady said.

Amanda disappeared shortly after she called her sister to say that she was getting a ride home from her job at Burger King.

On
Monday night, Amanda had a smile on her face as she hugged her weeping 
sister Beth as the pair were reunited for the first time in a decade 
following her decade in captivity.

The kidnapping victim also introduced her sister to her daughter, who was born during the 10-year ordeal.

When
she fled the house where she was a prisoner and ran across the street 
to call police, she was holding the hand of a young girl, who she gave 
birth to while being held by her captor.

Desperate to know what had happened to her daughter, Amanda Berry's mother Louwana Miller turned to a psychic on Montel Williams' television show in 2004.

'She's not alive, honey,' the psychic, Sylvia Browne, told her. 'Your daughter's not the kind who wouldn't call.'

Browne said she could see Amanda's jacket in a dumpster with 'DNA on it'.

Miller told The Plain Dealer that the blunt words forced her to consider her daughter might never return. She took down her pictures and gave away some of her belongings.

She said she '98 per cent' believed the psychic and that she returned from their meeting extremely distressed.

'I still don’t want to believe it. I want to have hope but, after a year and a half, what else is there?' Miller said. 'It seems like the God-honest truth. My daughter would always call home.'

search for her sister since their mother died in 2006.

Berry
was held in captivity at a house owned by Ariel Castro, who has now 
been arrested along with his brothers on suspicion of kidnapping.

Neighbors
reported hearing the sound of multiple children playing inside the 
house, but the identity of the other children and their relation to each
other are not clear.

Gina 
DeJesus and Michelle Knight, both apparently abducted from the same 
block as Berry, were also held hostage in the same house as her.

Beth's husband Ted Serrano told WOIO that his wife was overjoyed about her sister's return.

'She said [Amanda]'s okay, she's got a daughter. She said she's okay, she looks good,' Mr Serrano told the station.

Amanda's sister has continued to keep the case in the public eye since their mother died.

Relatives were emotional throughout the night on Monday, with some unable to speak through their tears.

'I'm
going to hold her, and I'm going to squeeze her and I probably won't 
let her go,' Amanda's cousin Tesheena Mitchell told The Cleveland Plain 
Dealer.

Emotional: Tasheena Mitchell, Amanda's cousin, said that she can't wait to hug her 'and never let her go'

'She's doing okay': Ted Serrano, Amanda's brother-in-law said that he spoke to his wife who was at the hospital with Amanda and she told him that Amanda had a daughter that she gave birth to during her abduction

Beth Serrano has worked closely with the DeJesus family, whose daughter Gina was found in the same home as Amanda.

Last year, DeJesus' mother Nancy Ruiz suggested that her daughter might have been the victim of human trafficking.

On Monday night,
Gina's cousin confirmed to CNN that Ms Ruiz had spoken with her 
daughter at the hospital and confirmed to relatives that she is alright.

Gina's aunt, Sandra Ruiz, said that Gina told them that she knew her family had never given up the search for her, even saying that she had posters they had made in the bedroom where she was staying during her capture.

'[Gina] knew who we were, and she knew we were looking for her all this time,' Sandra Ruiz told WOIO. 'She had posters we had posted.'

Other case: Gina DeJesus went missing in 2004 on
her way home from school and was held captive with Berry

The
Cleveland Police Department released a brief statement confirming that 
the three young women were all safe and 'seem to be in good health.'

'Currently
they're safe, we're in the process of evaluating their medical ends. 
They appear to be in fair condition at the moment,' Cleveland 
MetroHealth Emergency doctor Gerald Maloney told reporters at a press 
conference Monday night.

'This is really good because this isn't the ending we usually hear to these stories so we're really happy for them,' he said.

The dramatic rescue came when a neighbor heard Berry calling for help, kicked the door of the house in and gave her a telephone to call 911.

Happy news: Dr Gerald Maloney said that the young women were all in 'fair condition'

Held captive: A neighbor managed to kick down a door at the home, pictured, freeing the women

'Help me, I'm Amanda Berry... I've 
been kidnapped and I've been missing for ten years and I'm here. I'm 
free now,' she is heard saying in the call to police.

'I
need them now before he gets back!' she said in the frantic phone call,
going on to identify her captor as Ariel Castro, a 52-year-old Hispanic
man.

Castro has lived in the house since 1992 and he was arrested for domestic violence in 1993.

Berry disappeared on April 21, 2003, a day before her 17th birthday, and a year later DeJesus went missing at the age of 14.

Knight was abducted in 2002, but her case was much less famous than those of the other two girls because she was believed to have left home of her own accord.
