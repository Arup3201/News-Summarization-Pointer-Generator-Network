Three in four petrol stations have closed in the last 40 years, leaving drivers with longer journeys to fill up their tanks.

An official report ordered by ministers also warns that less competition is driving up prices as motorists hit with the highest prices at the pumps in history.

With prices still soaring as family incomes are squeezed, more and more people are now driving further in search of cheaper fuel.

Most people have a petrol station (PFS) within a five minute drive, but in some rural areas the nearest forecourt is 20 or even 30 minutes away

MPs expressed alarm at the scale of the closures and claimed it added to claims of price-fixing at the pumps.

Ministers commissioned a major study 
into the scale of forecourt closures amid concern about the impact of 
‘fuel deserts’ on motorists.

Energy minister John Hayes has now 
ordered officials to work with the industry and retailers to ‘ensure 
motorist always have a ready and secure supply of fuel’.

In 1970 there were 37,539 petrol stations in the UK but by 2012 the number had fallen dramatically by 75 per cent to 8,677.

Ministers demanded the study to uncover the scale of the closures, which saw the number of petrol stations slump from 37,539 in 1970 to 8,677 in 2012

In the decade to 2011 alone 29 per 
cent of forecourts shut. Yorkshire and Humber was hardest hit, losing 33
 per cent of stations from 2001-11, followed by London 32 per cent and 
the South West 31 per cent.

The ‘closures had a negative impact on
 access’ to petrol stations by ‘increasing the minimum driving time 
required to reach the nearest’ forecourt in some areas, the government 
report by consultants Deloitte said.

‘These closures also reduced the number of… options available to consumers within a 10 minute driving time in some areas.’

Supermarkets have massively increased 
their market share, often offering cheaper deals to shoppers but 
squeezing out independent retailers and limiting choice.

Supermarkets now own 14 per cent of 
petrol stations, up from 9 per cent in 2001, but sell 40 per cent of all
 road fuel, putting pressure on competitors.

Oil companies have lost market share, with Tesco recently overtaking BP as the largest retailer in terms of fuel volumes sold.

Supermarkets forecourts also tend to 
have smaller stocks to meet demand, so are less able to cope if supplies
 are disrupted. 'This may have a detrimental impact on resilience,’ the 
report warned.

‘Some consumers may be prepared to travel a considerable distance to purchase fuel at a lower price.

In 2009 almost 60 per cent of drivers 
said they filled their car where it was convenient rather than cheap, 
but three years later that figure has slumped to 40 per cent as 
hard-pressed drivers hunt for bargains.

Tory MP Robert Halfon, who has campaigned on petrol prices, said: ‘I am alarmed at the decline in petrol stations.

‘Britain is being taken for a very expensive ride by some of these oil companies, who are crushing the independent retailers.

‘I hope that the Government will use 
this report to add ammunition to the OFT study into allegations of 
price-fixing at the pumps.’

Tory MP Robert Halfon said he was 'alarmed' at the decline in petrol stations

The report warned that in the worst 
affect areas ‘if there are any short-term supply disruptions, consumers 
may not only face longer driving times to access the nearest [petrol 
station] but in the event that the nearest has run out of fuel they may 
have to travel even longer.

‘Besides short-term supply 
disruptions, there might also be wider competition effects from closures
 in such areas, potentially resulting in consumers being faced with 
higher prices due to their reduced ability to substitute between 
different [petrol stations].

The loss of petrol stations is felt acutely in rural areas, where people already have to travel further to reach vital services.

Official figures show someone living 
in the countryside has to travel for 12 minutes to reach their local 
hospital compared to just eight minutes in urban areas.

Some drivers now have to travel for 
more than 10 minutes and in some cases more than 20 minutes to reach 
their nearest petrol station.

A combination of the recession and more economical vehicles meant petrol demand in 2011 was just below 1970 levels.

Energy minister John Hayes said he
 wanted to get ‘an accurate picture’ of the scale of the closures to 
‘consider any possible implications for our security of supply’.

He said the closures had not had ‘an 
impact on the vast majority of motorists’ but he added: ‘My officials 
will be working  with industry, trade associations and other government 
departments to ensure motorist always have a ready and secure supply of 
fuel.

‘This report will help inform our 
further work here, as will the findings of OFT’s Call for Information 
into this sector, due in January 2013.’

The government had frozen fuel 
duty for two and a half years and a review of business rates had been 
postponed to prevent ‘significant business rate hikes for forecourts’, 
he added.
