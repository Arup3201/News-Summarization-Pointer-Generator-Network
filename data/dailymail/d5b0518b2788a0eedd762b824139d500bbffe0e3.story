The kidnappers who held Carlos Tevez's father hostage for eight hours told him: 'Your son's our idol but we need the money.'

According to Segundo Tevez they were also upset when they heard the former Premier League star had been left out of Argentina's World Cup squad.

Detectives were today hunting the gang as a video emerged of the moment the kidnappers targeted delivery driver Segundo.

The car used by the kidnappers was found abandoned in El Palomar, a Buenos Aires suburb

They 
forced him out of his car at gunpoint and decided to kidnap him on the 
spur of the moment after checking the vehicle's papers and spotting the 
surname Tevez.

They
 captured him a couple of streets away from where they had held him up 
early this yesterday morning as he tried to find a taxi in the Buenos 
Aires suburb of Moron.

CCTV
 footage now being examined by police show the men turning right at a 
crossroads in a white Volkswagen Passat to follow Segundo's black Dodge 
Journey.

The gang demanded nearly £300,000 to free Segundo - who raised Carlos from the age of five after his mum abandoned him and his birth dad was shot dead.

However, they settled for around £30,000 after Tevez, who led negotiations from Italy, said he would pay no more and the kidnap drama was leaked to the press.

Segundo was freed just before 2pm local time yesterday after the ransom money was handed over at a third drop-off point the kidnappers gave so they could create confusion and escape the police net.

Tevez's father told police afterwards his abductors had said: 'Carlos is our idol.

'He's the greatest there is. We don't want to hurt him. Why would we?

The Argentine Secretary for Security, Sergio Berni, confirms to the press that Segundo Tevez, father of the Carlos Tevez, has been released by his kidnappers

'The problem is we've got children and we need the money. We haven't got any alternative.'

'We hope he forgives us.'

They also gave him a drink and biscuits at a petrol station they stopped at to refuel.

Argentina's security secretary Sergio Berni last night promised a no-holds-barred hunt for the kidnap gang.

He said: 'We're going to look for them under beds if we have to and we're going to find them.

'Believe me when I'll say that's what we'll do and it's not just because it's Carlos Tevez's dad.'

Confirming the three culprits thought to be involved were not part of a professional kidnap gang, he added: 'At the beginning they stole his car and let him go.

'They returned for him after realising it was Carlos's dad.

'Obviously we're not talking about a professional kidnap gang. We're confident we will catch them.'

Tevez, who signed for Italian side Juventus in June 2013 after successful spells at West Ham, Man United and Man City, confirmed his father was okay late last night night in his first comments since the dramatic kidnap.

He took to Twitter to say: 'I thank everyone for their support. I want to let you know my father is well, safe and sound. That's the most important thing.'

He added in a later Tweet: 'With the sadness I feel it would be easy to criticise my country, but with its all its defects and virtues it's the country I love.'

Tevez's biological father died in a shootout in Fuerte Apache, the run-down Buenos Aires slum where the footballer grew up, when he was just five.

His mother Fabiana abandoned him when he was just six months old and he ended up being brought up by her brother Segundo, who he calls dad and shares a surname with.

Earlier this year Tevez expressed his admiration for his adoptive father in a poignant Twitter message on his birthday, writing: 'You showed me how to be a man.

'My sadness is yours and my achievements your satisfaction. I love you old man. Happy birthday.'Tevez is said to send Segundo money every month and paid for his other children to watch him play at the World Cup in south Africa in 2010.

His relationship with the only brother by birth he maintained a friendship with, Juan Alberto, was strained after he was arrested for holding up a security van while his millionaire sibling played for Man United.

Express kidnappings, where hostages are taken for a short amount of time and a low ransom, have grown more common in recent years in Argentina as the country's living standards have dropped.

The country, once one of the world's richest, is now dangerously close to defaulting on its external debt payments.

Cristian Riquelme, brother of former Spanish La Liga star Roman, was kidnapped in Argentina in 2002 when he was just 17.

He was released after his family paid half of a £175,000 ransom demand.

Former Barcelona star Gabriel Milito's dad Jorge was snatched in the same year and released only after his family paid nearly £8,000.
