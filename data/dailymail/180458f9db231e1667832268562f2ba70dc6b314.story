Dapper: Lincoln Townley leaving Southwark Crown Court in London after appearing charged with theft

Celebrity Big Brother winner Denise Welch's alleged toyboy lover appeared in court today charged with stealing £12,000 cash from a building firm.

Lincoln Townley, 39, is accused of stealing the money from FM Conway, a construction company based in Dartford, Kent, in 2009.

Townley, who is 14 years younger than 53-year-old Welch, is said to have had a secret eight-month fling with the Loose Women presenter behind her husband Tim Healy’s back.

Dressed in tight skinny jeans, a black shirt and black jacket, party planner Townley spoke only to confirm his name at today’s short hearing at Southwark Crown Court.

Townley was due to stand trial, but the case had to be adjourned until May for him to be granted legal aid.

When asked outside court about his relationship with Welch, who was recently crowned Celebrity Big Brother winner, he refused to comment and a pal with him shouted: 'F*** off.'

Welch, 53, is alleged to have met Townley last April at the Jet Black nightclub in central London and gone back to his apartment.

The pair have since been spotted at trendy bars and clubs in the West End and Townley reportedly met up with her in hotels after she had finished filming Loose Women in London.

It is claimed the pair even spent the night together in a five-star hotel before Welch went into the Celebrity Big Brother house, where she famously got topless in the hot tub with X Factor reject Frankie Cocozza, and that she had told pals he was her 'London guy.'

It is not the first time Welch has cheated on her husband. In 2004 she had an affair with carpenter Steve Murray and Mr Healy wanted a divorce before finally forgiving her.

However, the actress, who has been married to the Auf Widersehen Pet star for 24 years and has two children with him, appeared to shrug off the latest affair rumours as she celebrated her husband’s 60th birthday on Monday.

The pair laughed and joked and Welch, who is known for her wild antics, even flashed her bra at waiting photographers.

She is said to have told a friend she and Mr Healy were not splitting up saying: 'Tim and I are incredibly secure and have a very happy marriage. Family, our sons, are out biggest priority.

'I just want all this to go away so we can get on with our lives.'

Earlier this week another man, 26-year-old theatre producer Tom Hopkins, who is gay, claims he had a four-month affair with Welch after meeting her at a wake.

A spokesman for Welch and Mr Healy said they believed the allegations to be false. When asked about the affairs on Loose Women, Welch replied: 'Everything is fine at home.'
