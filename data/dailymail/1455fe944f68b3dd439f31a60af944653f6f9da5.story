Fuego has played in every game for Valencia but they are willing to listen to offers as they evaluate their own new signings following investment from billionaire Peter Lim.

Manager Sam Allardyce is weighing up a new midfielder and centre-back to combat a combination of pending Africa Cup of Nations call-ups and Winston Reid's refusal to sign a new contract.
