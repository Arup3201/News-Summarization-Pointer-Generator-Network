Amid the clamour and commotion of the delivery room, it could so easily have gone unnoticed.

As newborn Evan Wilson was handed to his delighted mother, the midwife spotted that his stomach was swollen.

She took him away to be examined by specialists – and at just two hours old, Evan became the youngest patient to be diagnosed with liver cancer in Britain.

Survivor: Evan Wilson, now aged five months and pictured with his parents Lorraine and Scott, is the youngest patient in Britain ever to have cancer detected - just 15 minutes after he was born

Diagnosed with hepatoblastoma, Evan lies in a special care unit at Princess Royal Hospital in Glasgow

Aged 12 days, he began chemotherapy, 
which tested medical expertise to the limit as doctors struggled to 
calculate the safe dosage for such a young child.

But Evan, now six months, has 
responded so well to treatment that mother Lorraine, 39, father Scott, 
41, and six-year-old sister Jorja are now waiting for confirmation that 
he is in remission.

Mrs Wilson said: ‘I only held Evan 
for a few minutes when they took him off me and all this began. I was 
howling. It was horrendous to go through.’

Newborn: Just moments after Evan was handed to his mother Lorraine, a midwife spotted his swollen stomach

Seriously ill: Within two hours of his birth, doctors diagnosed Evan with hepatoblastoma

But the quick actions of the midwife 
at Glasgow’s Princess Royal Hospital in November may have saved her 
son’s life.

Evan was diagnosed with hepatoblastoma, a rare form of liver
cancer, and transferred to nearby Yorkhill Royal Hospital for Sick 
Children on the same day.

Mrs Wilson, a psychiatric nurse from 
Lennoxtown, East Dunbartonshire, said: ‘If the cancer  had spread, the 
doctors said  his chances would have been reduced massively.

‘You wouldn’t know he was sick to 
look at him now. Apart from a central gastric feeding tube in his nose, 
he looks like a normal healthy child.’

Protective: Evan's sister Jorja, then aged five, watches over her little brother

Rare diagnosis: Evan is one of only a handful of babies born in Britain to develop cancer in the womb

As well as seven chemotherapy 
sessions, Evan had an operation to remove his gall bladder and half his 
liver at Birmingham Children’s Hospital in April.

He now faces a two-week wait for the 
results of yesterday’s MRI scan. Dr Jairam Sastry of Yorkhill Royal 
Hospital said: ‘All the ultrasound results show that he is in remission 
and the MRI scan he has undergone is just to confirm that.

'He has done 
really, really well. His prognosis is very good.’
