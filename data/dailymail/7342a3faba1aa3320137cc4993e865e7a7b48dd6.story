Steven Gerrard has hit back at former England team-mate Paul Scholes after he claimed Wayne Rooney should face the axe at the World Cup.

Scholes questioned whether Roy Hodgson had the nerve to drop Rooney if he failed to deliver at his third World Cup.

But Gerrard claimed Rooney is in peak condition as England prepare for Friday night's clash with Peru at Wembley.

Wrong: Steven Gerrard doesn't agree with Paul Scholes' claims that Rooney should be axed at the World Cup

Former star: Scholes played 67 times for England between 1997 and 2004, scoring 14 goals including this one against Croatia at Euro 2004

The England captain said: ‘Paul Scholes is wrong. He’s been Manchester United’s best player at home and in Europe. He’s been in terrific form. What I’ve seen from his performances in the United team, he’s been really positive.

‘He’s in a better frame of mind going into this tournament than he’s had going into previous tournaments when he’s had injuries.’

Hodgson agreed: ‘Of course I don’t think he’s past his best. I’ve selected him in a 23-man squad that I’m very proud of. I believe in Wayne Rooney, he’s still a young man.’

Rooney starts up front for England on Friday evening in a strong line-up before the squad travels to Miami on Sunday and Hodgson says he wishes he could bottle the team spirit and use it against Italy in the opening group game.

‘I’m looking at the three matches, I suppose. I’m affected by this being our last game in England, a massive crowd and a huge responsibility, so it’s not an experimental team.

‘If I could bottle what I am seeing at the moment and keep it like that and release it on June 14 I’d be a happy man. Our job is to be in peak condition on June 14. I couldn’t have wished for a better week.

Pointing the way: Rooney will start up front for England in the friendly against Peru at Wembley on Friday

‘I’ll lean on the players who have done the job for us up to now against Peru. I can experiment more in Miami.

‘I want to see a good performance. The players want to give a good performance. 

‘I’m very pleased that such a big crowd will see us off at Wembley but I’d be lying if I said I had a specific goal for the Peru game and the next two. Our goal is to gain experience in the next three games and give  everyone game time.’

Pleased: England boss Hodgson is happy with the progress his side are making ahead of the World Cup

Southampton left back Luke Shaw will probably have to wait for his second cap as he has a head cold.

Gerrard starts and is expected to be partnered by his Liverpool team-mate Jordan Henderson. Jack Wilshere, just returning to fitness, will play in the second half.

Raheem Sterling and Adam Lallana will be given chances to win starting places against Italy but Hodgson has yet to decide whether to start them together in a 4-2-3-1 formation.

Hodgson also revealed he wants to take standby players Everton defender John Stones and Liverpool’s Jon Flanagan to Miami.
