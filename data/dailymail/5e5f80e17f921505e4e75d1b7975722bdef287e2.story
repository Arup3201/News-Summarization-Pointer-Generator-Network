Anton Ferdinand has signed for Reading after a turbulent year following his release from Queens Park Rangers.

The 29-year-old had been playing his football for Antalyaspor but cut short his stay in Turkey. It had been thought that the former West Ham man was ready to pen a deal with Police United in Thailand, but he has opted for a move back to England. 

'I've been away from English football for a year and had some tough times,' Ferdinand said. 'Turkey is a fantastic place to go and play football, but certain things off the field didn't allow me to enjoy my football.

'That chapter is closed now, and I've opened a new chapter at Reading and I'm looking forward to it.

'I've got things to prove, to myself and everyone. A lot of people have written me off and doubted me because I've been away for a year, but I'm here to prove to people that I can offer a lot to English football.

'I want to offer what I can to Reading, and hopefully that means promotion.' 

Royals boss Nigel Adkins was clearly anxious for the deal to be done when talking about their 2-2 draw at Wigan on Saturday. 

'Anton's another player who has played in both the Premier League and the Championship,' he said. 

'He's an experienced player who maybe has something to prove. He's been in the wilderness for the last couple of years.

'I'm sure he'll have the attitude to embrace that challenge.'

Ferdinand has signed a two-year contract at the Madejski Stadium in a bid to resurrect his career.
