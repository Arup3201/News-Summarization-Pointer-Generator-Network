Tragic: The mysterious death of 16-year-old Liam Aitchison on the Isle of Lewis is now being treated as murder

Two men are being held by police in connection with the murder of 16-year-old Liam Aitchison on the island of Lewis.

His badly beaten body was discovered 
in a derelict RAF building in the Steinish area of Stornoway last month,
a week after he went missing.

Liam, originally from the nearby island of South Uist, was the first to be killed on Lewis for more than 40 years.

Detectives were hunting for three people wearing ‘hooded-type tops’ who were spotted near where Liam’s body was found.

Detective Chief Inspector Kenny Anderson, of Northern Constabulary, said they were seen walking in the area shortly after midnight on November 22.

Police have carried out raids on at least four properties on Lewis.

Liam was last seen in a Co-op store on November 22, the day he was due to be sentenced at the sheriff court for assaulting or hindering two ambulance technicians trying to treat him after an incident in the town centre.

He was believed to have been living at the home of his half-sister, Natasha, 20, and was working as a fisherman.

The teenager had been involved in several serious incidents around the islands recently. He was hurt in a car crash on October 22 in which a girl, who was sitting on his lap in the front passenger seat wearing a seatbelt, was badly injured.

His aunt Kate Macdonald, 47, of Lochboisdale, South Uist, said ‘something went awfully wrong in the last few weeks’ but ‘nobody knew what or why’.

A Stornoway taxi driver, who said he 
was in touch with police, claimed yesterday that he had been hired by 
Liam after the time officers said he was last seen.

The taxi driver, who asked not to be named, said: ‘I took him to an address outside Stornoway late that night.’

In a statement on Friday, Liam’s family begged anyone with information to come forward.

The last murder inquiry in the Western
Isles was in 1968 when Mary MacKenzie, 80, was found dead in her 
cottage at Brue on Lewis. Charges against a seaman accused of battering 
her to death were dropped.

Mysterious: Liam was last seen in Stornoway on November 22.
