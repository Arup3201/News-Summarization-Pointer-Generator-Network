With the average Australian wedding now costing around $36,000, it pays to shop around.

An undercover investigation by Choice has discovered that brides are routinely charged more for services than other customers, with vendors charging up to $8,000 more if they know the event they're catering was a wedding.

Despite the price discrepancies discovered in the investigation, the situation has improved somewhat for brides, compared to five years ago, when Choice last conducted an investigation into wedding costs.  This has been put down to increased competition in the industry as more ‘hobbyists' enter the wedding business.

To test the added charges attracted by weddings, Choice hired two shadow shoppers to source quotes from venues, photographers, florists, hire car companies, cake companies and photo booth hire companies across a range of demographics in both Sydney and Melbourne.

Vendors charge considerably more if they know the event they are catering for is a wedding rather than another gathering

Caitlyn approached vendors telling them she was planning a low-key wedding for 80 people and asking them how much each item would cost.

Nikki then approached the same vendors a week later asking them for a quote on the same item on the same day, but telling them she was hosting a 40th birthday party for her partner.

The wedding-shopper was quoted prices significantly higher than the woman shopping for a party, across almost all categories.

Venue

Both women approached venues, asking them for a quote on a three-course, sit-down dinner. Three of the six venues approached by the shoppers charged Caitlyn more when they discovered she was planning a wedding. One quoted her $9,600 compared to $7,200 quoted to Nikki for the party; another quoted $1,700 for the wedding and $1,300 for the party.

A third venue told Caitlyn they could not do a price-per-head for her wedding, but would instead charge her between $12,000 and $18,000 for the event. But when the same venue was approached by Nikki a week later they said they could cater her event for $125 per person, a total cost of $10,000 for 80 people, thousands of dollars cheaper than the quote offered to Caitlyn.

One cake company quoted Caitlyn $590 for a wedding cake and Nikki $220 for an identical 'birthday cake'

Cake

Both women approached six cake companies and asked the price of a white chocolate mud cake to feed 80 people with flowers on top to be delivered on the same day. In two cases the bride was quoted significantly more than the other woman: Caitlyn was quoted $590 compared to $220 for Nikki and another shop quoted Caitlyn $670, whereas Nikki was told the same cake would cost her between $500 and $600.

Hire car companies approached by the two women also charged extra if they knew the event was a wedding.

Hire car

Six hire car companies were approached and were asked how much it would cost to pick them up at an inner-city suburb and drop off an hour away. Three of those six companies told Caitlyn, the wedding-shopper, that they did not do one-hour call-outs and so only provided her with quotes for three-hour call-outs, despite her insistence she only wanted the car for one hour.

But those same companies were happy to provide a one-hour quote to Nikki, the party-shopper. One company quoted Caitlyn  $1,500 compared to $650 for Nikki; another quoted Caitlyn $990 compared to $300 for Nikki; and the third company quoted Caitlyn $1,000 and Nikki $450, meaning that Caitlyn was quoted up to $850 more because she wanted the cars for a wedding rather than a 40th birthday party.

Venues charged people dramatically different prices depending whether or not the event was a wedding

Photographer

Like the hire car companies, some photographers were unwilling to be flexible when it came to a wedding package, whereas they were more willing to be flexible for a birthday party.

Because wedding photographers often spend the whole day with a couple, in order to make the comparison fair, Caitlyn, the wedding-shopper told photographers she was having a very informal wedding and that a photographer was only required at the reception to capture the festivities and some semi-formal photos of friends and family with the bride and groom for two hours.

Nikki then approached the same photographers to ask if they would attend the birthday party for two hours to capture photos of the festivities and some semi-formal shots of family and friends.

Two photographers told both women that they would not accept a booking for just two hours. One photographer quoted $400 to the bride without a confirmed venue, yet told the party girl he wouldn't provide a quote until she confirmed the venue.

One Sydney  photographer quoted Nikki, the party-shopper $1495 for two hours, but quoted Caitlyn $4750 for a five-hour package, despite her insistence that she only needed someone for two hours. This photographer tried to put emotional pressure on Caitlyn to accept the five-hour package, being told ‘this is the most amazing day of your life – we capture that emotion, we tell that story. You can go back and relive the whole day through the photos'.

Photo booth

Photo booth vendors were generally fair to brides, with all of them quoting the same prices to both Caitlyn and Nikki, with the exception of one Photo booth company, which added an extra $50 fee onto the quote for the wedding.

Flowers

To make the comparison fair, the florists were presented with identical requests - white flowers to decorate the tables, with Caitlyn telling the florists a friend would be making her bouquet.

So that the quotes were comparable, Caitlyn would approach a florist and ask for recommendations of white flowers and when Nikki would approach the same florist a week later, she would request arrangements using the same flowers, to account for seasonal variation.

The overall cost of white flowers to decorate eight tables ranged from $600 to $1,200 and florists quoted the same prices to both Caitlyn and Nikki.

The investigation found that flowers were generally exempt from a 'wedding' premium

Venues and photographers are the worst offenders
