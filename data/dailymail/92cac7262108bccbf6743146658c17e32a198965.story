Outraged conservationists have objected to the Tasmanian government's bold new plans which would see the 'wilderness' title removed from the state's Wilderness World Heritage area label.

Under the proposed changes, the stringent protection placed on Tasmania's Wilderness World Heritage Area will be altered to allow for expanded tourism developments, helicopter access and even logging. 

The management plan draft claims that the term 'wilderness' is 'deeply problematic for Tasmanian Aboriginal people and is conceptually alien to Aboriginal understanding of country'.

It further claims that the management of the region for wilderness values is a 'denial of their rights to access country and conduct cultural practices.'

Vica Bayley, the Wilderness Society's Tasmanian campaign manager labelled the statement an 'extremely manipulative and deceptive argument', as the Tasmanian government had only recently expanded four wheel drive tracks over sacred Aboriginal middens in the north-west of the area. 

Tasmania's Liberal government provided $300,000 for the controversial development, which would see 90 kilometers of track upgraded and reopened, reported The ABC.

The move was met with outrage by the Aboriginal community, as the area was home to countless rock engravings, middens, and hut depressions. 

'This is completely tourism and development driven. If this is an example of 'sensitive development' then the community can have zero confidence in the plan,' he said. 

The draft specifically opens up the zone for tourist developments, and even allows for logging in the region.

The 1.5 million hectare region, which covers approximately a quarter of the state, will be reclassified from the current 'wilderness zone' to a 'natural zone', effectively removing the strict guidelines for development and tourism in the area, including Frenchmans Cap and Franklin River, in the Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park (above)

Matthew Groom, Minister for Environment, Parks and Heritage, confirmed in a statement that 'selective special species timber harvesting was already permitted in a small number of zones within the area.'

'The draft plan is about achieving balanced outcomes that are genuinely respectful of cultural and natural values, while at the same time recognising that the TWWHA is an area to be used, celebrated and shared with the world,' Mr Groom said. 

While the official title will remain unchanged, Mr Bayley has labelled the proposal a threat to the integrity of the iconic landscape of the state.

'Doing away with the wilderness zone impacts on the credibility and integrity of the brand of Tasmania, and our state's claim as wilderness,' he said.  

Mr Bayley said that the state trades on the 'idea of wilderness', and that it was a key motivating factor for people to visit.

The Federal Government has obligations under the World Heritage Convention, which Australia has been signatory to since 1974, to take the 'measures necessary for the identification, protection, conservation, presentation and rehabilitation of this heritage.'

'The label is central to Tasmania's identity. If the Wilderness zone no longer has protection, that is an attack on the brand. We actively promote ourselves with that label, it's on everything,' he said.

However, the draft, leaked from the Office of Environment, Parks and Heritage, removes the term of 'wilderness' from the title, which Mr Bayley said will enable the government to 'rewrite' the activities legally allowed in the region.

'The Tasmanian government is seeking to facilitate sensible and appropriate recreational experiences including new tourism opportunities through the EOI process,' said Mr Groom.

'This plan is all about managing the area properly while ensuring we can use it to generate tourism and jobs,' he said.

Several of the objectives included in the draft include 'commercial opportunities', 'the support of management through tourism', and 'the balanced use of aircraft'.

The draft states that the Tasmanian government acknowledges the 'important role tourism plays in contributing to the economic wellbeing of the Tasmanian community.'

Mr Bayley said that the changes showed a lessening of the state government's commitment to protect the area, shown through the  removal of the pledge included in the previous management plan  to 'strive to maintain the property and leave it in as good or better quality than it was found'.
