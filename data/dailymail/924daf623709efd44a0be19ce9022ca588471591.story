Wales' Francesca Jones added to her silver collection and Laura Halford claimed bronze in the rhythmic gymnastics individual ball final on Saturday morning at the Hydro.

Canada's Patricia Bezzoubenko claimed her fourth gold medal of the event with a routine of 15.250 ahead of Jones who won her fourth silver medal with a routine of 14.875, while team-mate Halford won bronze with 14.550.

Jones had earlier continued Wales' medal rush after she won her third silver medal of the games in the hoop final following success in the team and individual all-around final.

Bronzed: Wales' Laura Halford finished third in the rhythmic gymnastics individual ball final

Canada's Maria Kitkarska set a modest 
target of 12.800 at the start of the ball final which England's Stephani
 Sherlock immediately surpassed after achieving a score of 12.950.

Halford was the next gymnast in front of the judges and the 18-year-old eased into top spot with a mark of 14.550.

Cyprus' Themida Christodoulidou moved second with 14.050 before it was Jones' turn to return to the floor.

The
 Welsh gymnast moved into the lead and would have claimed gold but for 
the dominance of Bezzoubenko, who was the last gymnast out and performed
 an impressive routine which well surpassed her mark in qualifying.

Earlier,
 Jones, who also won silver with the hoop in the 2010 Delhi Commonwealth
 Games, was beaten to top spot in the first final of the day by 
Bezzoubenko, who won her third gold with a routine of 14.800 in the hoop
 final.

Jones took second place just 0.05 marks behind Bezzoubenko with 14.750, while Malaysia's Wong Poh San won bronze with 14.650.

Christodoulidou
 opened the hoop final with a score of 13.250 but her lead did not last 
for long as Malaysia's Amy Dict Weng Kwan moved ahead with 14.200.

Kwan's team-mate Wong then set a testing target with a routine to throw the gauntlet down to favourite Bezzoubenko.

The
 Canadian team and all-around gold medallist was next on the floor and 
responded with an elegant performance of 14.800 which catapulted her 
into the lead.

Sherlock, who
 had qualified in sixth place, scored 13.875 to put her outside the 
medals and then it was Jones' turn to bid for her third medal of the 
Games after Wales' team silver and her all-around silver from Friday.

Jones'
 score was marginally lower than Bezzoubenko achieved and she moved into
 silver medal position with two gymnasts still to compete.

The
 next was Wales' Halford, whose 14.250 put her into fifth place at the 
end of the competition, outside of the medals by 0.4 of a mark.

Cyprus' Pantelitsa Theodoulou finished fourth with a score of 14.500.
