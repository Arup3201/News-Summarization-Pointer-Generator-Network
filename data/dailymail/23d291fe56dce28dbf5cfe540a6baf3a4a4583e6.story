He truly is a fatherly priest.

John Cornelius, a husband and father of three, took a vow of chastity to become a married Catholic priest Saturday in a traditional ordination ceremony.

His wife and three daughters watched from the pews as Cornelius, 64, started the ceremony wearing a white robe and later was covered in priestly garments as he swore his faith to God.

Cornelius remained quiet as he was ordained, but showed his enthusiasm soon after.

Fatherly father: John Cornelius, a husband and father of three, took a vow of chastity to become a married Catholic priest Saturday in a traditional ordination ceremony.

‘It’s wonderful. I feel like I’ve been working my whole life to answer God’s call and here I am,’ the former Episcopal priest told the New York Daily News.

The 20-minute ordination took place in Immaculate Conception Church in Wellsville, New York, and was presided over by Buffalo Bishop Richard Malone and several other priests who prayed over Cornelius as he submitted himself.

Cornelius’ wife of 33 years, Sharyl, gave her blessings during the ceremony, despite the reality that it means giving up sexual relations with her husband. She too promised to take a vow of chastity.For his part, Cornelius now has a new mission in life.

‘I’ve raised three girls already,’ he said Friday.

Cornelius, who was previously an Episcopal priest for 20 years, found his new role with the support of his family.

'I have always had friends that are Roman Catholic priests and I appreciate what they've given up to serve god and the priesthood,' he told WGRZ-TV on Wednesday.

'I have such appreciation and affection for these guys, that it's just part of my own spirituality to do this...out of respect for them really.'

Cornelius and his wife became Catholics after he left his former church two years ago, unhappy with its direction.

But he was unable to make the move to priesthood until Pope Benedict XVI issued an order saying married former priests could be ordained a year ago.

'When they did that, I just jumped,' said Cornelius, 'I needed someplace where there was order. I've been a Baptist, Presbyterian, Methodist...messed around with Bahá'í, Harikrishna...I was almost an Anarchist in college...so it's been a search, and it's really been a search for order.'

Supportive: Sharyl Cornelius, center, has opted to voluntarily take a vow of chastity as well. The couple have three grown-up daughters, pictured.

The couple weren't forced to make the decision to opt for celibacy but put themselves forward anyway.

'We don't have to take that particular vow,' Cornelius said, 'We have decided to do that voluntarily'.

Though the decision came easy to him it was a long process to be approved for ordination - it even included a psychological examination.

'It wasn't easy. We had one dossier that went to Rome where they did research on us, and I had to go see the shrink, the psychologist, and other people,' he said.

'But even that only determined that you didn't have really bad things in your background that prevents you from being a priest...and then there was 14 weeks of intense instruction over the internet which was taught by St. Mary's Seminary in Houston, Texas.'

Cornelius is now among the first 30 Episcopal priests throughout the U.S. to make the transition to Catholicism.

Starting Monday he will lead the Fellowship of Saint Alban in Henrietta (Diocese of Rochester), a small community of former Anglicans who have joined the Catholic Church.
