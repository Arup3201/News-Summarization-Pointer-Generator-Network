A woman has been stopped by police for aparently breastfeeding her baby while riding a moped.

The young mother was allegedly driving through the streets of  Yuzhou, China when she was pulled over.

Officers said she was weaving through traffic while holding her 18-month-old son on her lap as he breastfed, and they pulled her over before she had an accident

Witnesses have claimed they saw the mother begin to breastfeed the child while keeping a hand on the handlebars.

Breitbart reports that police were concerned she was risking her life, her son's life and the lives of all the other road users. 

They added that if she carried on they would take her bike away.

In June 2008, Catherine Donkers, 29, was accused of child endangerment for trying to breastfeed her daughter while driving from Detroit to Pittsburgh. She was also apparently driving without a licence.

In her defence she said using a mobile phone caused far more distraction than 'nursing a child' while driving.

And in 2009 a  drunken mother 
was breast-feeding her five-month-old baby at the wheel when she almost 
crashed into a police car.

The
 teenager was so drunk she could not provide a roadside breath test and 
was arrested at the scene in the Australian town of Alice Springs.
