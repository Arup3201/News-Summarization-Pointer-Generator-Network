A week after veteran CBS news correspondent Steve Kroft admitted to a lengthy affair with a much younger New York City attorney, a snap has emerged of the pair together last month.

Standing awkwardly on a Manhattan street on December 17, the 69-year-old newsman can be seen looking at his lover, 41-year-old Lisan Goines, who is grinning back at him - just blocks from the Upper West Side home he shares with his wife, Jennet Conant, author of 'A Covert Affair'.

The pair, who are both married, met for drinks at the five-star Essex Hotel and were later seen kissing in the back of a cab, according to the National Enquirer.

Kroft has admitted to the affair, calling it 'a serious lapse in personal judgment' after the magazine revealed that the duo had carried on a three-year relationship and published their raunchy texts.

'My wife and I are committed to each other and are working hard to get past this,' he told the New York Post. 

The 60 Minutes correspondent, who is married with one son, and Goines hooked up in hotels across Manhattan and Washington, D.C. after meeting at a bar in 2011, it reported.  

Kroft had spotted Goines - who was then engaged to be married - from across the room in the St Regis and went to talk to her and her friend.

While her friend was using the restroom, 'Steve quickly told Lisan, "I have to see you again",' a source said.

A few weeks later, they arranged to meet for cocktails and afterwards, he handed her a room key so he could be alone with her, convincing her he was in a sexless marriage, the Enquirer reported.

Throughout their affair, Kroft and Goines exchanged a series of racy text messages, including one in which he told her he 'would rather be eating your pudding' than be at work.

'Don't work too hard this week bc I wanna wear you out afterward,' Goines reportedly replied.

In another message, he told her: 'Miss you and all that goes with it. Especially my favorite tastes and colors... pink and brown,' according to the publication. 

He also asked her what her 'preference' would be, and she reportedly responded:  'U all over and deep inside of me,' she reportedly responded.

Sources also revealed the couple's bedroom habits, including his use of Viagra and how he poured champagne in her behind before drinking it.

But while their affair began at the $700-a-night Four Seasons hotel, it quickly lost its luxurious edge and went 'kind of low end', a source said.

She would often meet him while he was working in Washington D.C. and once asked him to buy her a ticket, and he agreed but only footed the bill that once, the report added.

'The whole thing soured because she got to the point where it was only about Steve,' a source said.

They added that Goines never had any intention of leaving her husband and did not want Kroft to leave his wife, so ended it - until they were spotted out in Manhattan together on December 17.

The reports come more than two decades after Kroft confronted Bill Clinton over his womanizing when he was Arkansas governor. 

He has been married to Conant, 55, for 23 years. She is a journalist and author of four books about World War II, including three New York Times bestsellers, including 'A Covert Affair: Julia Child and Paul Child in the OSS'.

The couple lives in New York and they have one son, John.

Kroft joined CBS in 1980 and has been with 60 Minutes for 26 years. His reporting has earned him three Peabody Awards and nine Emmy awards, including a lifetime achievement award.

He told the New York Post that his 'personal failure' has no impact on his job as a journalist.
