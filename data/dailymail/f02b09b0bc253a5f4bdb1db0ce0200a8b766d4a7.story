Drivers who think their cunning short-cuts save time in the rush hour are kidding themselves, experts have revealed.

In fact, using a so-called rat run to bypass gridlock on bigger roads is more likely to make a commute longer.

Congestion at the busiest times on smaller roads is twice as bad as on main highways, according to research by satnav experts TomTom.

Using a so-called rat run to bypass gridlock on bigger roads is more likely to make a commute longer, according to research by satnav experts TomTom

Its annual congestion report revealed that traffic jams in British cities have become worse, with average journeys in 2013 taking 27 per cent longer than they would in free-flowing traffic – up from 26 per cent in 2012.

TomTom says British commuters spend the equivalent of ten working days a year stuck in traffic, up from nine a year ago.

But those clever little escape routes on which millions of drivers pride themselves to escape the worst of the jams are most likely a false economy, say the experts.

And the reluctance of motorists to believe that may be down to drivers preferring to ‘feel’ as if they are on the move and in control  – even if it takes longer in reality – to the helpless feeling of moving at snail’s pace in slow moving traffic.

The TomTom research notes: ‘Drivers using rat runs may actually be making their journeys slower.  The data shows that local roads have twice as much lost travel time (32%) as main roads (15%).’

TomTom spokesman Julien Speed said: ‘Many motorists are very proud to tell others about their secret rat-run that helps them avoid the worst of the rush-hour gridlock. But the reality is that it probably takes them longer.’

He said satnav systems update traffic information every two minutes and are more accurate measure of near real-time conditions.

‘It may be counter-intuitive, but the satnavs really are more accurate. But when you are sitting in a jam it may not feel that way at the time,' he said.

‘Psychologically,  people want to keep moving, or at least feel they are moving and in control. So  they will often use their favourite rat-run to ‘get around’ the problem, even if it takes longer or the traffic moves even slower on the local roads than on the major roads which they’ve just left. On average the local roads move at half the pace.’

Mr Speed said: ‘Pride and ego is also at stake. People do like to tell others about how they have beaten the traffic, even if in reality they haven’t. Some drivers do simply think they know best and won’t be convinced otherwise. But the satnav is a better predictor.’

AA president Edmund King agreed that rat-runs often do take longer – but feel better.

He said: ‘It is largely psychological. People do like to feel they are moving. You see it on clogged and congested motorways like the M25. Some drivers divert off the motorway to find an alternative route along local roads. But often they’d get to their destination quicker if they just stayed on the  congested and slow-moving main route.’

Belfast was the most congested city, with the worst periods 36per cent more congested than the free-flowing ones.

London and Edinburgh were the next worst-congested cities, followed by Bristol, Brighton, Manchester, Leeds-Bradford and Sheffield.

Of the 17 biggest cities, only two were less jammed in 2013 than in 2012, with congestion worsening in 10 and staying the same in the other five. The biggest increases in congestion were in Sheffield and Leicester.

The company also released world-city figures, which showed Moscow was the most-congested destination, followed by Istanbul and Rio de Janeiro, which will be one of the main football World Cup venues this summer.

Traffic experts estimate that time lost as a result of traffic congestion costs the UK economy £2billion a year and warn that it is set to get worse despite a £28billion plan for road improvements in the UK.

The Government has forecast four million more drivers on UK roads by 2030 and that, by 2040, the volume of traffic will have risen by 40per cent.
