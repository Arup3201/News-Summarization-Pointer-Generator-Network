Convicted rapist Ched Evans and his former Manchester City team-mate Clayton McDonald bought a rattlesnake and a tarantula to frighten each other while living together.

McDonald, who was cleared of rape in the same trial that saw Evans sentenced to five years in prison in April 2012, began the exchange by buying Evans the snake because he knew his friend was frightened of them, reports the Independent's Ian Herbert.

Evans, 25, bought a tarantula in retaliation to the practical joke before the pair were told to get rid of the creatures by the family they were staying with in Stretford, Manchester.

Ched Evans and former team-mate Clayton McDonald were 'bored witless' according to their houseparent

Greg Barnes told the Independent that while the incident was typical of the pair, he felt that Evans appeared foolish rather than violent and dangerous to him.

Discussing the attitudes of Evans, McDonald and young footballers in general, Barnes said: 'When they are scholars they have a very rigid timetable, with lessons, training and games. When they are given a professional contract, that stops.

'They are out on their own. They are competitive kids and they are bored witless.'

Sheffield United have denied offering Evans a new contract but refused to rule out signing him again

Evans signed a professional contract with City in 2007 and McDonald in 2008. Both left the club in 2009 for Sheffield United and Walsall respectively.

Evans was released from prison earlier this month after serving half of his sentence.

Mr Barnes' son Andrew, 25, last week claimed Evans shot him with an air rifle, before offering him more than £10,000 to keep it quiet.

Barnes was allegedly shot in the thigh by Evans, who had been hiding behind a garage shed at the family's home.

After he had been shot with the gas-fired air rifle, the business consultant was taken to hospital with a pellet lodged in his bones - but doctors left it there over fears that removing it would be unsafe.

Andrew Barnes told The Sun: 'I could see a hole in my thigh where the pellet had gone. Doctors said it was only my bone that stopped it going all the way through my leg and out again.

'How can someone in their right mind fire an air rifle at a friend? He was quite far away when he fired. Had he moved the gun by millimetres, it could have hit my chest and killed me.'

Mr Barnes claimed that before the shooting incident in 2009, he had seen Evans peering round the garage at the home and pointing the gun at him from about 50ft (15 metres) away.

He added: 'Then I felt something in my leg and realised he shot me. Ched was always shooting things in the garden.'

Mr Barnes said his mother found pellets in cupboard doors, walls, sinks, window frames and even the fridge. He said that shortly after the incident happened he launched legal action against Evans.

Police allegedly questioned Evans and McDonald but no charges were brought. Just before Evans' rape trial, he offered Mr Barnes a £10,900 payout with a gagging agreement.

The footballer was convicted of rape in April 2012, and the next month a £10,000 payout was agreed - for injuries and legal costs.
