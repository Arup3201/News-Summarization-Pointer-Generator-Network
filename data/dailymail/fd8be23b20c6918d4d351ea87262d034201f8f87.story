Shoppers who use eBay will soon be able to collect their goods from Argos stores.

The service, which will be trialled before Christmas, will allow eBay users to ‘click and collect’ from more than 150 Argos shops across Britain.

The auction site hopes this will solve the problem of its customers waiting at home for parcels or having to pick them up after missing the postman.

Amazon, eBay’s biggest online rival, already has deals with newsagents across the UK, letting shoppers pick up packages in their own time.

Currently more than 18million people in Britain use eBay. Although it began as an auction site for private sellers, more than 100 household names – from the Superdry clothing brand to House of Fraser – now use it to sell their wares.

Initially only the top 50 eBay sellers, all large brands, will be able to offer the ‘click and collect’ service, for which there will be no extra charge. If the six-month trial is successful, it could be expanded to all of Argos’s 735 UK stores.

The service will eventually  also become available to the millions of ordinary eBay users who auction off everything from second-hand clothes and unwanted gadgets to spare concert tickets.

Buying online and collecting  in store has become the fastest growing aspect of the high street, with Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Asda all already offering  the service.

More than 40 per cent of British shoppers
used some form of click and collect last Christmas, according to 
figures from research group Econsultancy.

Devin Wenig, president of eBay, said: ‘The distinction between offline and online shopping continues to blur. This exciting pilot takes us one step nearer to our goal of offering a seamless shopping experience.’

Argos began its own collection service in 2000 which now accounts for a third of its business. The company is expecting to also benefit from the deal with eBay because it will increase the number of shoppers coming through its doors.

Dr Scott Dacko of Warwick Business School said: ‘It is likely to be a win-win-win arrangement.

‘I am sure it will prompt a host of competitors to look into similar partnerships. Integration in online and off-line sales is the future for retail.’

But Maureen Hinton, of research group Verdict, warned that Argos risked setting itself  up as a ‘warehouse for its rivals’ if it rolled out the scheme too quickly.
