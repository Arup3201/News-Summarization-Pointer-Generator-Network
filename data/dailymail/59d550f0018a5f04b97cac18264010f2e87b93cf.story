The cop, and mother of two, killed in the line of duty in Santa Cruz on Tuesday died doing the job she loved, her sister has revealed.

Elizabeth Butler, a 10-year veteran police officer, died while investigating sexual assault claims against Jeremy Goulet, who opened fire on the 38-year-old officer and her partner, 28-year veteran Loran 'Butch' Baker, killing both when they walked up to his door to talk to him.

'She just seemed always to be very well-adjusted and happy and super fun. The thing about her job, she really liked to investigate things.' her sister Alexis Butler said.

Butler had initially joined the police because she had moved to the area and needed to support herself and her artist boyfriend.

Alexis Butler said her sister was ideally suited to her work and never became depressed about what she had to endure. 

Handling sex crimes, Butler excelled at conducting interviews and interrogations, and interviewing children.

'My sister believed in the innate goodness of people,' her sister said. 'She didn't dwell on it.'

During her career, Butler worked as a patrol officer, hostage negotiator, a bike officer, a narcotics investigator and walked a downtown foot beat.

At home, Butler and her boyfriend were raising their two children, sons Joaquin, 5, and Stellan, 2.

Butler and Baker are the first police officers killed in the line of duty in the history of the Santa Cruz department.

Santa Cruz Police Chief Keith Vogel called Tuesday the darkest day in the department's history. The suspected shooter, Jeremy Peter Goulet, 35, was killed in a gunbattle with police officers about 30 minutes after shooting Butler and her partner.

'(My sister) was a very admirable person and she never faltered,' said Alexis Butler.

'She was a good person and she was compassionate toward people. Just last weekend she said she wished more women would become police officers.'
