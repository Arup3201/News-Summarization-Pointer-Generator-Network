 While the sentiment was undoubtedly sweet, you might agree the result is a tad cringe-worthy.

Baffled Heathrow travellers look on as a small a-cappella group serenade a beaming girlfriend and rather crimson boyfriend at arrivals.

As the group continues in its full four minute performance the couple continue to stand awkwardly watching them, making for one of the more embarrassing flash mobs to hit the internet.

Alexander Kasi, 25, from London, was expecting a male friend  to walk through the  gates at Heathrow airport, but instead was greeted by his girlfriend and a crowd singing a mash-up of current hit Rather Be by Clean Bandit and I Wanna Be Your Lover by Prince.

Alexandra Suriano, 27, had organised vocal harmony group All The Kings Men to filter among the waiting crowd and slowly begin singing.

Alexander's initial confusion gives way to a heart warming smile as his girlfriend holds up a set of cards explaining the surprise.

'I have just (very excitedly) traveled across the Atlantic for 5,000 km and seven hours,' the cards read as she flicks through them, 'to spend a romantic weekend together. 

'I love you so much. Will you please join me? And hug me already?'

The couple stand in the arrivals gate and watch the rest of the song performed as other passengers look on

The pair embrace in a tender moment, despite Alexander's embarrassment, but the following minutes where they are forced to stand awkwardly watching the a-capella group finish the song while bemused passengers mill around them. 

Explaining her motive for the undeniably sweet gesture Alexandra says: 'Alex lives in London and I live in New York. We are currently doing long distance but manage to see each other roughly every other month.

The couple, who were introduced by friends in New York, are in a long distance relationship 

'Alex is from Switzerland and I am from El Salvador, but we're both highly international. We were introduced to each other by a mutual friend in New York and after a month we decided we wanted to do long distance together. 

'We also realised we worked at the same bank and we had gone to the same university at different years. We've been together for 8 months.

'The surprise was just because. He surprised me in New York by showing up in July and I wanted to do something similar.

'Part of the surprise was me packing a bag for him and renting a car so we could drive to Essex, where we stayed at a beautiful hotel the whole weekend.

'Because he loves cars, part of the weekend surprise was to take him to drive super cars, where he drove a Lamborghini and an Aston Martin. I had also planned for a hot air balloon ride but that was cancelled due to weather.'
