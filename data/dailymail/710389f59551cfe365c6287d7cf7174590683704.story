One hundred years since Brazil and Argentina first locked horns, it wasn't Lionel Messi, Neymar or one of the modern household names on offer that separated the South American rivals.

Instead, it was a 29-year-old striker by the name of Diego Tardelli who settled the so-called 'friendly' in Brazil's favour to salvage some much-needed pride after a dismal  2014 World Cup on home soil.

Two shots and two goals were enough to justify him sporting the No 9 shirt on Saturday in Beijing's first Superclasico de las Americas, but who exactly is the Atletico Mineiro man?

Sportsmail examine the Brazilian who remains adamant the 2018 World Cup is his next target.

What's his history?

Perhaps we should have expected nothing less from a man named after Argentina's 1986  World Cup winner Diego Maradona and Italy's 1982 winner Marco Tardelli.

The 29-year-old's last name is, in fact, Martins. 

But the veteran has gone by Tardelli ever since emerging from the youth ranks at Sao Paulo  a decade ago  at the age of 19.

There, he was sent on loan to Spain's Real Betis, Brazil's Sao Caetano and Holland's PSV to cut his teeth.

The Eredivisie club are notorious for giving the original Ronaldo, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Arjen Robben early chances  in their prestigious careers, and Tardelli was hungry for the same in Eindhoven.

But it has been Mineiro that truly backed the striker in his two stints at the Brazilian  club.

Tardelli, after an initial spell between 2009 and 2011, remains at the Estadio Independencia in Belo Horizonte and has nine goals in 19 appearances so far this year in Brasileirao.

Tardelli may not be the youngest in the Brazil starting XI, but he  wasn't the oldest!

26 - Willian

23 - Oscar, Danilo

22 - Neymar 

A little old, isn't he?

Tardelli, born in 1985, was surrounded by youth in Brazil's attack on Saturday. To name a few, Neymar is 22, Oscar, 23 and Willian, 26.

Nevertheless, Tardelli, a fast-paced attacker by nature, was gifted his seventh international cap by Dunga after a strong start to the season and made it count with his first goals in the yellow of Brazil.

The man born in Santa Barbara d'Oeste received his first call up in 2009 from Dunga, but never managed to get further than finding himself on the back-up list for Brazil at the 2010 World Cup.

And last year he revealed his disappointment in not being given a chance by Luiz Felipe Scolari.

Now, though, Dunga is back at the helm and seems willing to back the veteran. Tardelli, substituted in the 83rd minute for 2002 World Cup-winner Kaka,  repaid his new manager's faith in Beijing.

£4.1m - Al-Gharafa to Atletico Mineiro

So, what's he worth?

When Tardelli returned to Atletico Mineiro from a fairly successful spell at Al-Gharafa in Qatar, the Brazilian club's president Alexandre Kalil announced it cost about £4.1million.

In fact, it was his own mum, Ivania, who revealed the transfer on Twitter, writing: 'I'm very happy! My son is coming back to Galo (Atletico Mineiro's nickname). Thanks, Lord!'

Tardelli's stock has slightly dropped in value as his career has developed, but he looked as clinical as any other  on Saturday with two well-taken goals against  Lionel Messi and Co of Argentina.

The first, a volley that found the far corner beyond frustrated goalkeeper Sergio Romero after sloppy Argentinian defending. The second, a typical goal poacher's header.

So, 2018 World Cup...

'It's a unique feeling,' Tardelli reportedly said after netting his brace. 'Scoring my first goal for Brazil, and against who? Against Argentina. Then I even got my second. 

'My goal is to play World Cup 2018. I need to enjoy the moment now. I want to celebrate with my family, with my wife.'

Tardelli will be 33 when the next World Cup in Russia rolls around. Though arguably be too old to beat others to a call-up, the striker refuses to give up on what he sees as his ultimate reward.
