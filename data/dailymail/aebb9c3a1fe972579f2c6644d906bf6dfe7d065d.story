Do you struggle with the concept of washing your hands in a public toilet and then having to open the door?

If the idea makes your skin crawl and conjures up images of bacteria-riddled door handles contaminating your newly clean hands, a new invention could be for you.

An entrepreneur from Essex has imported to the UK a device which allows people to open doors with their feet.

Mick Janaway will start selling StepNpull in the UK on Monday. StepNpull is a metal device which screws onto the bottom of a door allowing a person to put their foot on it and drag the door open

Mick Janaway brought StepNpull over from the U.S. and will launch it on Monday.

The simple metal contraption can be screwed onto the bottom of a door, allowing a person to place their foot on it and pull the door open.

Mr Janaway believes it could prevent the spread of disease and infection.

He came across the device in America after he caught an infection that nearly caused him to lose his arm.

In August 2012 he contracted an infection in a small cut on his right thumb.

It travelled up his arm and infected his bloodstream with strep A – a group of bacteria which are usually found on the surface of the skin and inside the throat.

StepNpull will be sold online for £40 - Mr Janaway hopes it will help to stop the spread of infection and disease

Mr Janaway became interested in devices which help prevent the spread of bacteria after he picked up an infection which nearly cost him his life

Mr Janaway said: ‘I had four life-saving operations to save my arm and life – at one point I even stopped breathing on the operating table.’

If strep A bacteria penetrate into the tissues and organs of the body it can trigger what is known as an invasive infection.

This can cause sepsis - an infection of the blood that causes a high temperature, rapid heartbeat and rapid breathing.

Invasive strep A infection is viewed as a medical emergency and requires admission to hospital.

Mr Janaway said: ''It was in Colorado that my life changed forever with the discovery of StepNpull. The minute I saw it, I was hooked. I just couldn't believe how simple it was and that nobody had done it before'

The patient has to be treated with antibiotics and may also require surgery to remove damaged tissue.

One in four people who develop and invasive strep A infection die from it.

As a result of his near-death experience, Mr Janaway planned a list of trips to take with his family.

He said: ‘It was there in Colorado that my life changed forever with the discovery of StepNpull.

‘The minute I saw it, I was hooked. I just couldn't believe how simple it was and that nobody had done it before.’

Dr Klaus Misch said: 'StepNpull is a product I would personally like to see installed in every hospital, school, restaurant, public house, or indeed anywhere where there is a public toilet. It's a truly innovative product and one that could change the world'

Dr Klaus Misch, a consultant dermatologist, added: ‘So you think you have clean hands? Typically we have between 10,000 and 10 million germs on our clean hands. This number doubles when we have used the toilet.

‘Research in London estimates that if everyone routinely washed their hands after using the toilet a million deaths could be prevented.
