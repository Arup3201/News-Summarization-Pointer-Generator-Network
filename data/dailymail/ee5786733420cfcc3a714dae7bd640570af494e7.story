He suffered a heart scare last year, when an irregular heartbeat forced him into hospital, and there was further heartbreak for Michael Jamieson last night.

The so-called 'poster boy' of Glasgow 2014, the man tasked with giving Scotland's Games the start it deserves, had to settle for silver again in the 200 metres breaststroke. That he was beaten so convincingly by his compatriot, 20-year-old Ross Murdoch, in both the heats and final on Thursday, will only add to the pain.

This was a responsibility Jamieson had taken on his broad shoulder and vowed to carry out himself, waking up at 5.45 each morning to see the world record time of 2mins 7.01secs etched on his alarm clock. He had embraced the peculiar pressures of a home Games but, ultimately, it proved too much.

'J'aime son' read the banner in the Scot's hometown pool in his east end corner of Glasgow, very close to Celtic Park where thousands watched Jamieson win Olympic silver on the big screen two years ago.

But silver was the last thing on Jamieson's mind on Thursday night: after settling for second place at Olympic, world and Commonwealth level, he desperately wanted gold.

'Ross deserved to win,' he said. 'But I don't prepare to come second and it is just not good enough.'

Jamieson smiled as he walked out to the inevitable rapturous applause, apparently determined to enjoy this momentous occasion, but he was always fighting for a podium place behind a world-class swimmer, never mind the title he so desired.

Australian Christian Sprenger flew off the blocks from lane eight, but Murdoch and Jamieson clawed him back. It was the Scot in lane four, however, not Jamieson in five, who began to edge clear of the field as the race entered its final two lengths and, despite a late surge, it was Murdoch, wide-eyed with shock, who touched in first.

His time, 
2mins 7.30secs, was a new Games record - his second of the day - and 
less than three tenths of a second outside the world best Jamieson so 
craved. The pre-race favourite recorded 2mins 8.40secs, with England's 
Andrew Willis third in 2mins 9.87secs.

Thrilled Murdoch said: 'There's no way that just happened. I can't believe it. That was amazing. It's a dream come true.

'It
 was a massive personal best for me. I didn't think I could do that if 
I'm honest. I'm so surprised. I can't believe it's just happened.'

He added on BBC One: 'It's my grandad's 70th birthday today so that swim was for him.'
