The £2million police review of the Madeleine McCann case will examine calls from psychics which were previously ignored.

Detectives are studying around 100 logs of calls that were discounted because the callers said they were psychics or had dreamt about the high-profile investigation.

Critics said the decision to include information from ‘supernatural’ sources was a waste of resources.

Mystery: The evidence has emerged as Gerry and Kate McCann prepare to mark the fifth anniversary of their daughter's disappearance tomorrow

Police were inundated with calls about Madeleine after she disappeared during a family holiday in Portugal on May 3, 2007.

Crimestoppers set up an international number and sent the information they received to Leicestershire Police, the McCann family’s home force, and to Portuguese police.

But Leicestershire Police reportedly 
asked Crimestoppers not to forward information from psychics, or calls 
based on dreams about the case.

Missing: Madeleine aged three, left, and in 
Scotland Yard's computer-generated age-progression picture of how she 
might look now, at the age of nine

Some 100 call logs were not passed on because of the request, Sky News reported. But they have now been sent to the Scotland Yard team reviewing the case.

Kate
 McCann's book about Madeleine's disappearance has sold nearly 400,000 
copies and raised up to £1million for the fund to find the missing 
child.

Mrs McCann 
thanked supporters for buying her account of how her daughter went 
missing on holiday in Portugal, which was published in hardback a year 
ago.

She said: 'The book has done amazingly well. That's thanks to the general public, and I'm really really grateful.

'Not only obviously has it helped Madeleine's Fund, more importantly it's got people engaged again.

'There's more awareness now, there's more information still coming in now.

'For
 a long time we had wanted to correct things that were incorrect, just 
so people could be better informed, and therefore the search enhanced.'

Her
 husband Gerry added: 'It's put everything in the right context. So much
 in this case has just been taken as snippets and taken out of context.

'It's a properly considered record of what we've gone through, and Kate's done a brilliant job.'

Mr
 McCann said sales of the book, simply entitled Madeleine, are 'close to
 400,000' and it may have generated as much as £1 million for the 
couple's fund.

A paperback edition with a new epilogue will be published on May 10.

The information will be examined and entered into the police computer for the first time to ensure no detail has been missed.

But it is considered unlikely that any serious investigation will result unless the leads are corroborated by other evidence.

Peter Kirkham, a former detective chief inspector with the Metropolitan Police, said he was sceptical about the ability of psychics to help police investigations.

‘As soon as you have a high-profile case you get a range of people coming forward,’ he said. ‘I’m certainly not aware of any case that’s been solved by psychics.

‘You can’t waste resources no matter 
how emotive a case may be.’ US crime author Pat Brown said in a Twitter 
message: ‘This “review” just gets stupider and stupider.’

Madeleine vanished days before her 
fourth birthday from an apartment in the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz 
while her parents, Kate and Gerry, had dinner with friends in a nearby 
tapas restaurant.

The review team has sifted through 
more than 40,000 pieces of information, including files from the 
Portuguese police investigation and from the private detectives used by 
Madeleine’s parents.

It has identified 195 potential new 
leads, but Portuguese police have refused to reopen the case because 
they say there is no new evidence.

Mr and Mrs McCann said the fact the Metropolitan Police were reviewing the case had made their lives ‘much more bearable’.

In a statement to mark yesterday’s 
five-year anniversary of her disappearance, the couple said: ‘It’s hard 
to define succinctly how it feels to have reached five years without 
Madeleine – impossible, heart-breaking, frightening, exasperating, 
incomprehensible.

‘Sometimes it feels like forever and at other times, just like yesterday.’

Scotland Yard said: ‘We can confirm we are in close dialogue with Crimestoppers to ensure that all material in their possession – from any source – is shared with us.’

Is she alive?

There have been no confirmed sightings of Madeleine McCann since she disappeared on May 3, 2007.

The original Portuguese police team believed she died in a ‘tragic accident’.

Kate and Gerry McCann have always insisted there is no evidence to suggest she is dead, and British police now believe ‘there is a possibility she is alive’.

Where is she?

There have been reported sightings all round  the world, ranging from the credible to bizarre psychic visions.

Of those investigated, none have been confirmed as Madeleine.

Who is responsible?

Three people were officially named as arguidos, or suspects, in the investigation - Kate and Gerry McCann and British expat Robert Murat.

All three were formally cleared when the investigation was shelved and have won libel cases against newspapers and broadcasters which falsely claimed they were involved in Madeleine’s disappearance.

The McCanns believe Madeleine was taken by an abductor.

Convicted paedophile Raymond Hewlett allegedly said he saw the girl twice before she vanished and claimed she was stolen to order by a gypsy gang, but denied he was involved.

He died in 2010.

Are there new leads?

British
 police have identified almost 200 new lines of investigation from the 
Portuguese case files and the McCanns’ own private detectives.

They have refused to reveal details.

Why was this not done before?

Portuguese
 officers were convinced Madeleine was dead and have admitted publicly 
that they did not fully investigate other theories, including many of 
the sightings.

What else was missed?

Police
 did not set up effective searches and did not alert the Spanish border 
for 12 hours, allowing a potential abductor to escape with Madeleine 
undetected.

Even a basic 
check of the other guests at the Ocean Club resort in Praia da Luz was 
not completed for 48 hours, by which time many potential witnesses had 
left.

Gratitude: The McCanns thanked Scotland Yard for their review and the public for the support they had received for their campaign

What about forensic evidence?

Police did not seal off the McCanns’ apartment until 10am the next day, by which time the McCanns, their friends, resort staff, concerned helpers and police officers had all potentially contaminated forensic evidence.

Samples were taken and tested for blood and DNA but were found to be so degraded and contaminated that the results were inconclusive.

Will the case be solved?

British police want the case reopened but public opinion in Portugal has not been supportive of the McCanns and there may be little interest in raking over a five-year mystery which has already damaged the country’s tourist industry.

Even if the case is reopened, the reality remains that blunders in the first few days after Madeleine’s disappearance may mean the McCanns will never know what happened to their daughter.
