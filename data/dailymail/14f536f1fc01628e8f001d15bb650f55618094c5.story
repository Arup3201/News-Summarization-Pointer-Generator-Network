Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli insists there will be no more fireworks off the pitch - and says that anyone who thinks he has sex just before a match is having a laugh.

The Italy striker is more famous for his off-field antics than his exploits on the pitch, and the most notorious incident was when fireworks were let off in his bathroom.

Balotelli said: 'I have done mistakes in the past, like everybody did when they were young.

Balotelli was speaking in an exclusive interview with Sport Magazine

'And the firework thing did happen, but it wasn't me who let it off. I know England is like this, though, so it's OK. It's a shame, sure, but I get used to it – the newspapers are always trying to give an image of Mario that is bad, printing things that aren't true.

'Off the pitch, really I don't have any problems because I am always home. When people speak bad about me, it's only because they listen to the media and read what the newspapers say. They maybe lose a little bit of focus on my football, so everybody thinks I am famous for what happens outside the pitch.'

The 24-year-old also said rumours of him having sex just before a match were unfounded - and that he is only interested in scoring on the pitch.

He told Sport magazine: 'Someone told me recently that I had apparently said that if I have sex three or four hours before a game, it is working for me on the pitch. Trust me, if I am having sex four hours before a game I am not able to play. I don't think anyone could. It makes me laugh, but this is not me.

'I am only focused on football. I live out in the countryside, I am relaxed and I just hope the time that I'm going to score is coming soon. Then maybe they will concentrate more on football and not all the other bull****.'  

To that end, Balotelli believes Brendan Rodgers's strength of character can help him make a success of his Liverpool career.

The Italy international said he was surprised by the quality in Liverpool's squad when he signed and has admitted that he is desperate to score his first Premier League goal for the club.

The striker has had the international break to focus solely on his club form after being dropped by the new Italy head coach, Antonio Conte, and says he is determined to repay the faith shown to him by the Liverpool supporters.

Asked about playing under Rodgers, Balotelli said: 'He is very good, a strong character, and I think that comes out in the way the team plays.

'I think he can help me improve as a player. He is very open, everybody can talk to him, but first he looks at the person, and second he looks at the footballer. With Brendan, you need to be a good person – you don't have to be, how do you say it, a d***head.

'I need to get in the box more. I don't do it enough, but it is something I am working to try to do more. I have never been a real, out-and-out striker – I have always been someone who goes around the pitch, you know?

'If it was my choice, I would always go with two strikers. It's the way I like to play, but Brendan asked me to play as the first striker. I understand that when the ball comes from wide on the left or right, I need to be in the box otherwise there might be no-one there at all.

'I can see already that the Liverpool fans really like me, although I know that maybe they are a little upset because I don't score. I see they appreciate that I am working hard, though, which is nice for me.'

Balotelli added: 'I didn't really know much about the club before coming here, but I've been really surprised.

'I knew they were a very good team, but I didn't know they were as good as they are. Of course we need to improve many things because we have started off not very good, but I think the players here are amazing.'

Balotelli said his current objective is to break his Premier League duck. 'I can see already that the Liverpool fans really like me, although I know that maybe they are a little upset because I don't score. 

'I see they appreciate that I am working hard, though, which is nice for me. I know I have one goal in the Champions League, but in the Premier League I have to start with one. After that, I might set myself a target, but I swear – right now my first league goal is my first and only objective.

'I need to get in the box more. I don't do it enough, but it is something I am working to try to do more. I have never been a real, out-and-out striker – I have always been someone who goes around the pitch, you know?

'If it was my choice, I would always go with two strikers. It's the way I like to play, but Brendan asked me to play as the first striker. I understand that when the ball comes from wide on the left or right, I need to be in the box otherwise there might be no one there at all.'

Balotelli also compared Steven Gerrard to his fellow Italian Andrea Pirlo: 'Gerrard is an amazing player. I had really not seen much of him before this season, apart from for England, but wow. I think of him as being at the same level as Pirlo.

'Vision, technique, but he is powerful as well. Stevie can do anything. It's going to be very difficult for the team to find another player like him in the future.' 

Balotelli is settling on Merseyside but misses his pet dogs who are back home in Italy; a labrador-pitbull cross Lucky, who lives in with the star's foster parents and his other dog, a rottweiler called Tyson, he said: 'If I say kiss, then she kisses me.

'Of course I miss my family and friends in Italy. But when I go back, I spend hours talking with my parents. Then I visit my friends and we do normal stuff – you know, playing PlayStation and ping pong. Then I pick up my dogs and we go for a walk.

'They are really clever, my dogs. Lucky is unbelievable – when you look into her face, it is like you are with a real person. When I speak, she listens. I only have to say things one time. If I ask her for her paw, she gives it to me. I ask her to sit, she sits; I say she can run, she runs. Everything I ask her to do, she does.'
