A couple who secretly converted a crumbling pigsty into a four-bedroom home have been ordered to move out after losing a battle against planning chiefs.

In a bid to outwit planners the  owner's made sure the outhouse looked like any other farm building, made of grey concrete blocks with big sliding doors and no windows.

But inside it had four bedrooms, a kitchen, living room and bathroom facilities and flourescent lighting and radiators. 

Planners say the occupants 'deliberately concealed' the property and the only clues to its use were a letterbox on an entrance gate and a satellite dish on a wall away from the road.

In a bid to outwit the planners the owner's of the former pigsty made sure the outhouse looked like any other farm building from the outside

The owners, named on documents as David Younger and his wife Elizabeth, had previously lived in the adjacent farm which they sold in 2008 and then bought the pigsty and other agricultural buildings.

The 3,293sq/ft shed, named Heathacre Barns, stands in the middle of the Norfolk Broads surrounded by farmland and waterways.

The local Broads Authority said the owners failed to get any planning permission to covert it into a house.

 They became locked in a dispute with the local authority after they began to investigating in November 2012, when they were refused access to the site.

Inside the couple created four bedrooms, a kitchen, living room and bathroom facilities, without securing the necessary planning permission

Planning chiefs became suspicious about the outbuilding and launched an investigation after they were refused access to the site

Four months later the council ordered the owners to get out and return it to its former use.

A last ditch attempt to overturn the council's decision failed and they have been told they must move out this weekend. 

The couple had tried to claim to the government's planning inspector they had obtained planning permission after living in the building for more than four years. However, the rule only applies when concealment is not used.

 During the two day-hearing the inspectorate heard that the previous owners as a store for 'wood and domestic items'.

He also said the barn looked like 'an old utilitarian agricultural building' complete with concrete walls and roof covered with a corrugated material.

The report states: 'There was a wide sliding door in the front wall of the building formed from old plywood and a domestic size door set back in a passageway some 2m from the front wall of the building.

'Together with its neighbouring shed, the former pig rearing buildings of Heathacre Barns have a run-down and low-key presence although a few items, which could be described as domestic in nature, such as a gazebo, a carpet, some garden plants and shrubs, and some small solar lights, were visible from the public footbath.

After losing their last ditch attempt to keep their home the couple have been ordered to move out and return it to its former state

'There was also evidence of cars regularly being parked within the site. There was a caravan in a poor state of repair and used to store household and garden items at the rear of the Barn.'

It also added that there was 'no natural light' in the building and it was mainly lit by 'striplighting with florescent tubes'.

The report also dismisses the couples claims that they had lived in the property for four years after buying the barn in 2005.

It was completed by 2008 but the Inspectorate ruled that they did not move into the building when they sold the neighbouring residential property the next year.

After the couple move out, the outbuilding will go under the hammer and is expected to fetch between £20,000 and £40,000 at auction

Instead they moved to a house in Loddon, Norfolk, while further work was carried out to make the barn habitable.

But the report did add that even if they had lived their for more than four years they would have no grounds of appeal on the basis that they had concealed the barn's use as a residential dwelling from the authorities.

Mr Younger told the hearing that he had never been covert about his work at the Barn and had not 'wilfully deceived anybody nor falsified any record to make his case'. 

As a result of the ruling they have put the pigsty up for auction with a guide price of just £20,000 - and a warning that it cannot be used for residential purposes.

They will have to strip out all the furniture and fittings and return the barn to its original state.

As the couple deliberately concealed the home, circled in this aerial picture, they were unable to apply for retrospective planning permission 

A report by a council planning officer said: 'It should be noted that it is considered that there has also been a deliberate attempt at concealment of this development.'

A Broads Authority spokesman said they were made aware of the property after a neighbour reported a 'vermin infestation.'

'Planning regulations apply to everybody to ensure we are all protected from unlawful development.

'This development did not meet building regulations and was first brought to the attention of South Norfolk Council and the Broads Authority because of neighbours' reports of a vermin infestation.

'We realise planning is a complex issue and will always try to work with applicants to help them find solutions to any hurdles.

They will have to strip out all the furniture and fittings and return the barn to its original state before it is inspected by council officials at the weekend

'But in this case a decision made by the planning inspectorate found the couple, who are experienced property developers, 'embarked on a complex, well thought out and interlinked series of actions over time to deliberately conceal their intentions from the Authority, and South Norfolk Council, after they moved out from the guesthouse they owned to the next door piggery.''

The spokesman explained that the couple took the case to the independent planning inspector, who ruled in the authority's favour.  

'They have to be out by Saturday and we will be inspecting the building to make sure they have removed the kitchen, bathroom and everything else they put inside.

'It can only be used as an agricultural building, which is why it is only £20,000.'

The couple own a second barn on the site in Chedgrave and previously owned a nearby house which they split into two properties and sold on.

Until they find a more permanent home they will be renting a room from the neighbours they sold their property to.

An enforcement order published by the Broads Authority in 2013 says the local planning authority started investigating the 'former piggery' in November 2012.

Robert Hurst, who is due to auction the building, said he did not believe the owners spent a 'huge amount of money' converting it

It says the building has a 'shallow pitched roof and no windows' and that the conversion is 'not of high quality'.

The enforcement also referenced a pile of cages outside the building which had been used to house chinchillas.

It claimed the owner had advertised the pets on the internet but that they were 'not an agricultural animal' was a 'development which requires planning permission'.

Robert Hurst, from Auction House, said the property will go under the hammer with a guide price of £20,000 to £40,000.

'The idea was to try and keep it concealed as a barn and because they converted the inside and didn't change the outside they got away with it for years,' he said.

'They concealed it, so even if they lived there for 20 years you couldn't then get any retrospective permission or anything like that.

'I think they have had held their hands up and admitted they are at fault.

'They have owned it for years because they used to live in the house next door before they bought the barn.

'They have done a lot of the work on the building themselves but I don't think they have spent a fortune on it.

'It doesn't have central heating and it has got electric plug-in heaters. I wouldn't have thought they spent a huge amount of money.' 

It is being sold at Dunston Hall Hotel in Norwich on February 18 at 11am.
