Comedian John Oliver couldn’t resist ridiculing Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz over the introduction last week of his controversial ‘Race Together’ initiative.

Schultz and the coffee chain have faced an avalanche of bad publicity and public derision over a well-intentioned initiative for its baristas to strike up a conversation about race relations in the U.S. with customers.

‘I think it’s pretty clear that no one has said “no” to this guy in 25 years,’ said Oliver as he could hardly contain his glee at the comedic material the announcement has created.

Speaking on his HBO show on Sunday, the British comedian said a conversation about race is ‘clearly important but there is a time and a place’

‘But it is not the length of time it takes to whip up a tiramisu frappuccino,’ he joked.

The campaign, announced on Tuesday, has received criticism that the company was using racial tensions to boost its bottom line, as it came in the wake of racially charged events such as national protests over police killings of black males. 

Others questioned how Starbucks workers could spark productive conversations about race while serving drinks.

'Still let's give Howard Schultz credit for starting a conversation across the racial divide with a white billionaire pitching an idea and any number of African American customers telling him how stupid it was,' said Oliver. 

One user tweeted: 'I don't have time to explain 400 years of oppression to you & still make my train.'

‘Hey how’s that conversation on race going Starbucks? Lots of fun right? What if this could be every morning?’ joked Oliver on his HBO show on Sunday

Another added: '#RaceTogether is what happens when a 1%-er without any actual anti-racist education or training has a mid-life 'white man's burden' crisis.'   

‘Hey how’s that conversation on race going Starbucks? Lots of fun right? What if this could be every morning?’ joked Oliver.

'Nice try Starbucks. Now you can go back to what you do best – burning coffee and glaring at us for using your bathroom without buying anything.'

'Just stay in your lane!' 

In the face of the backlash, Starbucks announced over the weekend that baristas will no longer be encouraged to write 'Race Together' on customers' cups.

The initiative ended on Sunday, but spokesperson Jim Olson denied that the phase out was a reaction to the push back the chain has received.

'Nothing is changing,' he said. 'It's all part of the cadence of the timeline we originally planned.'

In a statement on Sunday, Schultz said that the phase of the campaign that involved the messages on drink cups was 'just the catalyst' for a larger conversation

Ridiculed: After the campaign was announced, Twitter users slammed the idea as naive

In a statement on Sunday, Schultz acknowledged the naysayers and skeptics as an anticipated part of the outreach.

'While there has been criticism of the initiative - and I know this hasn't been easy for any of you - let me assure you that we didn't expect universal praise,' his statement said.

'The heart of Race Together has always been about humanity: the promise of the American Dream should be available to every person in this country, not just a select few. 

'We leaned in because we believed that starting this dialogue is what matters most. We are learning a lot. And will always aim high in our efforts to make a difference on the issues that matter most.' 

Schultz said that the phase of the campaign that involved the messages on drink cups was 'just the catalyst' for a larger conversation.

He also said this part of the campaign was always scheduled to end on Sunday.

Starbucks will still hold forum discussions, co-produce special sections in USA TODAY and put more stores in minority communities as part of the Race Together initiative, wrote Schultz. 

An executive on Starbucks' communications team, Corey duBrowa, even blocked people on Twitter before temporarily taking down his account after being bombarded with criticism over the campaign.

Questions: Another Twitter user pointed out the lack of diversity in the campaign material

DuBrowa later said in a post on Medium that he felt he was being 'personally attacked in a cascade of negativity' and that he had gotten overwhelmed, but later reactivated the account. 

Schultz had previously defended the ridiculed  campaign as 'very genuine'.

During Starbucks' annual shareholders meeting in Seattle on Wednesday, he said the company was simply trying to use its massive reach for good.

'Some in the media will criticize Starbucks for having a political agenda,' he said. 'Our intentions are pure.'

Speaking on CBS This Morning on Thursday, he added: 'This is a highly charged, highly emotional issue, we understand that.

'We've tried to be very thoughtful, very genuine, very authentic and recognize that by leveraging our stores, potentially, we can elevate the conversation and make a positive difference.'

He said that he was not surprised by the backlash but that if the company's workers can 'elevate the understanding and the empathy with one customer per day', he will be satisfied. 

When Good Morning America asked Schultz about some of the scathing criticism on Thursday, Schultz responded: 'Well, you know what I say to that - no good deed goes unpunished.'

He has explained that workers do not have to participate in the campaign, and that stores can make customers another drink or cover up cups if they don't like the message.  

A letter from Howard Schultz to Starbucks Partners regarding Race Together: 

Dear partners,

I want to offer my heartfelt thanks to every one of you for your fearless and energetic support of the Race Together initiative. Our objective from the very start of this effort -- dating back to our first open forum in Seattle last December -- was to stimulate conversation, empathy and compassion toward one another, and then to broaden that dialogue beyond just our Starbucks family to the greater American public by using our scale for good.

After a historic Annual Shareholders Meeting that focused on diversity and inequality, and an initial push for much-needed national discussion around these difficult topics, it is time for us to take stock of where we are, what we have learned from our efforts so far, and what is next.

This phase of the effort -- writing 'Race Together' (or placing stickers) on cups, which was always just the catalyst for a much broader and longer term conversation -- will be completed as originally planned today, March 22.

But this initiative is far from over. We have a number of planned Race Together activities in the weeks and months to come: more partner open forums, three more special sections co-produced with USA TODAY over the course of the next year, more open dialogue with police and community leaders in cities across our country, a continued focus on jobs and education for our nation's young people plus our commitment to hire 10,000 opportunity youth over the next three years, expanding our store footprint in urban communities across the country, and new partnerships to foster dialogue and empathy and help bridge the racial and ethnic divides within our society that have existed for so many years.

While there has been criticism of the initiative -- and I know this hasn't been easy for any of you -- let me assure you that we didn't expect universal praise. The heart of Race Together has always been about humanity: the promise of the American Dream should be available to every person in this country, not just a select few. 

We leaned in because we believed that starting this dialogue is what matters most. We are learning a lot. And will always aim high in our efforts to make a difference on the issues that matter most.

I want to thank those of you who took time this week to share what you were seeing, hearing, feeling and thinking as we rolled out Race Together across the country. An issue as tough as racial and ethnic inequality requires risk-taking and tough-minded action. 

And let me reassure you that our conviction and commitment to the notion of equality and opportunity for all has never been stronger.

Take care of yourselves and each other. I am proud to be your partner.

With great respect,

Howard
