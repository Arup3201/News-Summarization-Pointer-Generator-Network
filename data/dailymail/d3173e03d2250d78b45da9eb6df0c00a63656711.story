A former Air Force One jet which served five U.S. presidents is set to go sale, with bidding starting at $50,000.

The DC-9 aircraft, which served during the presidencies of Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George Bush Snr. and Bill Clinton, is currently in a hangar in Phoenix, Arizona.

But today the U.S. General Services Administration announced the unique piece of American history can be bought by a wealthy individual on May 15.

Travel in style: The former Air Force One aeroplane is going on sale with a reserve price of $50,000

Unique opportunity: Surely the new owner will want to sit here in the VIP cabin

Comfort: The main cabin which has 32 seats in the trademark navy and grey leather colouring

A public auction will allow anyone to make a bid, as long as they meet the reserve price of $50,000.

The official Twitter account for the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) tweeted today: 'Presidential history for sale! Former Air Force One/Two DC-9 up for auction.'

Air Force One is the air traffic control sign for whichever Air Force plane is carrying the president.

The GSA website also says the plane was a former Air Force Two plane, meaning it also carried the vice president.

It added: 'In the thirty years this aircraft was assigned to the 89th Airlift Wing (Feb 1975-Sep 2005) it flew Presidential missions, Vice President, First Lady, Cabinet Secretaries (Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, others), Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Senators, U.S. Representatives, Four-Star Generals, Admirals, Foreign Heads of State and other foreign dignitaries.'

Stood the test of time: The data plates identify this aeroplane as a unique aircraft in U.S. history

In control: Inside the cockpit where pilots have had the safety of America's leader in their hands

Only the best: President Barack Obama waves as he boards one of the new generation of Air Force One planes

Famous passengers: Bill Clinton, left, and George Bush Senior, right, could well have travelled on the plane

The auction will give one lucky wealthy individual the chance to own a unique piece of presidential memorabilia
