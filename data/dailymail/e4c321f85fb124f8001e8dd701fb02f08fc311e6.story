Dan Harris, the co-host of ABC's Nightline, revealed that it was drug abuse that caused an embarrassing on-air meltdown in 2004.

Then a fill-in anchor for Good Morning America, Harris was giving news updates one morning when he suddenly seized up and had to cut his segment short half-way through.

At the time, Harris was using cocaine and ecstasy to quell depression he developed after covering war for several years. That drug use is what caused the panic attack, Harris admitted in a confessional blog post on ABCNews.com.

That professional slip-up in front of five million viewers provided Harris a much-needed intervention, and he gave up drugs right then.

He's finally decided to come forward about his dark past in hopes that it might help others find solace the same way he has - through meditation.

That spring morning, Harris was filling in, giving news updates when the panic attack struck.

'I was overtaken by a massive, irresistible blast of fear. It felt like the world was ending. My heart was thumping. I was gasping for air. I had pretty much lost the ability to speak.

'And all of it was compounded by the knowledge that my freak-out was being broadcast live on national television. Halfway through the six stories I was supposed to read, I simply bailed, squeaking out a "Back to you."'

Harris said he first started self-medicating in 2003, after returning from the Middle East where he covered war in Afghanistan, Israel, Palestine and Iraq for several years.

When he got back to the states, Harris said he became depressed and started using the drugs as a way to mimic the adrenaline of the battlefield.

He says he never mixed his work life with drugs, and mostly took them on the weekends.

But even if he wasn't taking the drugs at work, they still had a impact on his adrenaline levels all the time - boosting his chances of having a panic attack.

'It didn't matter that I hadn't gotten high in the days or weeks leading up to my on-air Waterloo; those side-effects lingered,' he said.

After the attack, Harris' boss Peter Jennings assigned him to cover religion and through his reporting he found a solution to his post-war problems.

'Leveraging my position as a reporter, I explored everything from mainstream religion to the bizarre fringes of self-help to the nexus of spirituality and neuroscience.

'The accidental yet enormously helpful end result of all this poking around: I became a reluctant convert to meditation.'

He says he practices meditation because it has a direct impact on his attitude, making him 10 per cent happier.

Harris has written about his transition to a life of meditation in new book '10% Happier: How I tamed the Voice in My Head, Reduced Stress Without Losing My Edge, and Found Self-Help That Actually Works - A True Story'.

Harris co-anchors Nightline and continues to work for the weekend edition of Good Morning America. He is a graduate of Colby College and is married to wife Bianca Harris.
