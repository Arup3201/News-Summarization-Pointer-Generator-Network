Brazil don't need to be reminded what this summer represents - the heat is on and the home favourites tag just won't shift so it's little wonder every fine detail is being pored over.

So prepared are the hosts for any 
eventuality that No 2 Carlos Alberto Parreira revealed that
 they have compiled dossiers on 16 possible opponents who could stand 
between them and a sixth World Cup.

The three other teams in Group A, 
Croatia, Mexico and Cameroon, have been scouted and analysed for 
strengths and weaknesses. All four Group B teams Australia, Chile, the 
Netherlands and Spain, one of whom could meet Brazil in the second 
round, have also been scouted by the team's two main scouts Alexandre 
Gallo and Roque Junior.

Potential quarter-final and semi-final opponents have also been looked at.

'Sixteen teams have been totally watched 
and scouted,' Parreira told reporters on Monday as Brazil's players 
gathered for their first day of training.

Luiz Felipe Scolari's planning has been meticulous and this was evident when his squad arrived.

The stars had a medical check-up at the squad's Granja Comary 
complex in Teresopolis, 90 kilometres from Rio de Janeiro, dubbed the Brazil Lab.

David
 Luiz, on the verge of a Â£50m move from Chelsea to PSG, had his mouth and 
ears checked up, while his soon-to-be club-mate Thiago Silva got 
the same treatment.

A confident Parreira announced 'the champions have arrived', shortly after the first players arrived at the camp.

'I trust these players,' he added. 'We have the most expensive centre backs in the world. We have a brilliant team.

'We
 are favourites, of course, we are obliged to win, (but) being 
favourites isn't enough, we have to be serious and win on the field.'

They 
will no doubt be dreaming of World Cup glory at the Maracana come July 
13, but some of the players were able to recreate the feeling to some extent on the PlayStation.

Virtual victory: Fred (centre) celebrates a goal on the games console by Spurs midfielder Paulinho

Neymar, Fred 
and Luiz Gustavo played the FIFA World Cup 2014 game, with the 
Fluminense striker celebrating a goal from Tottenham's Paulinho as the 
Barcelona star slumped in his chair.

Chelsea midfielder Oscar hit the back 
of the net 11 times this season, but earlier in the term was hitting another type of 
target while out clay pigeon shooting, with the footage aired on BT Sport for the first time on Monday night.

But
 it's not all smiles across the country as they prepare for the big 
event. The
 Brazil team coach had earlier come under attack from protesters as they
 hammered on its sides while carrying placards to protest 
against the forthcoming World Cup.

The
 Brazil team were on their way to a training session in Rio de Janeiro 
when a large group of demonstrators blocked their path - covering the 
bus in stickers protesting over the ever-growing cost of next month's 
tournament.

With the World 
Cup kicking off in Sao Paulo on June 12, there is increasing concern 
over how prepared Brazil is to play host, with rumours of violent 
protests over the coming weeks and stadiums and transport systems that 
are yet to even be completed, let alone tested.

Brazil are in Group A with Mexico, Cameroon and Croatia, and are looking for their sixth World Cup triumph.

Pinpoint: Oscar will be hoping to hit the target on several occasions on home soil this summer

Fury: The demonstrators hammered on the side of the team bus and shouted anti-World Cup slogan

Concern: The team, including stars such as Neymar, David Luiz and Hulk, were on their way to a training session in Rio de Janeiro when the demonstrators blocked their path and covered the bus in stickers

Desperation: Protestors are against the money being spent by the government on the World Cup
