Her first foray into adult literature has left critics underwhelmed.

So news that JK Rowling will be returning to more familiar territory will be welcomed by fans.

Her latest release, Casual Vacancy, set entirely in a world of Muggles, received mixed reviews, with some fans hankering for Rowling’s magic touch.

But the popular author’s next book will be for children ‘slightly younger’ than Harry Potter age, she has revealed.

Speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, the world-famous writer said she has several new projects in the pipeline, but a book for young children will be the first to be published.

The revelation first came when a child at the festival asked the popular author when she expected to release another children’s book. She replied: ‘Being the writer of Harry Potter gave me an absolute horror of committing myself.

‘It felt like every tiny thing I said became magnified and came back to haunt me. But I think probably the next thing I write - or the next thing I publish - will be for children.’

She later added: ‘If the next book I publish is the one I think it will be, I have told my children about it and they really like it so that was quite encouraging.

‘It is for slightly younger children than Harry Potter was.’

Another novel for adults is also in the pipeline, she said.

The Casual Vacancy has been described as a ‘sexually explicit tale of ruthless snobbery and bourgeois hypocrisy’.

Set in the parochial West Country town of Pagford, it begins with the unexplained death of a member of the parish council. It also touches on dark themes of prostitution, drug addiction and rape.

The novel has soared to the top of fiction charts, with 2.6million copies sold before it even hit the shelves.

But it has divided critics, who have denounced it as ‘unadventurous’, ‘bland’, and full of ‘mean, graceless people without a trace of magic’.

Rowling, who began penning the Harry Potter novels as a penniless single mother writing in Edinburgh cafes because she had no money to heat her house, spoke at Saturday’s event of her personal battle with depression.

The best-selling author has admitted to suffering from depression throughout her career and last month revealed that she had undergone therapy several times to help her cope with adjusting to her fame and fortune.

'I do have a tendency to walk on the dark
 side sometimes. I have suffered from depression, I know how that feels,
 I have an innate inclination that way. Writing does help with that'

She said: ‘I do have a tendency to walk on the dark side sometimes. I have suffered from depression, I know how that feels, I have an innate inclination that way. Writing does help with that.’

The author also said that the ‘proudest moment’ of her life was participating in the London Olympics opening ceremony in July, when she sat on a grassy mound inside the Olympic Stadium and read an extract from JM Barrie’s Peter Pan.

‘Walking out on to the hillock at the Olympic ceremony was extraordinary,’ she said. ‘I think I will see it on my death bed. It was breathtaking and I felt extraordinarily proud to be in it.’
