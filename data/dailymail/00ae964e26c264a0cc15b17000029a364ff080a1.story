Troubled: Mr Gascoigne was seen wandering the streets near his home in Bournemouth

Troubled football legend Paul Gascoigne has been pictured wandering the streets near his home - just after he failed to show up for his adopted son's engagement party.

The former Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle striker, who is struggling with alcoholism, looked gaunt as he tightened his belt while walking in Bournemouth.

He could be seen with cuts on his hands, and initially covered his face with sunglasses, just after missing the event in honour of his adoptive son Mason.

But Mr Gascoigne was later seen carrying two shopping bags without his sunglasses - revealing that he has cuts on his face as well.

A source told The Sun: 'He is clearly in a bad way, though he insists he's doing his best to beat the drink.'

Mr Gascoigne's battle with alcohol has affected his family life before - last month he missed a trip to Spain with his ex-wife Sheryl Gascoigne, and his children Bianca and Regan.

He allegedly didn't turn up for the trip so he could go drinking instead.

Last month the former player, who appeared 57 times for the England national side, admitted to reporters that he had been the victim of bank fraud, losing him up to £50,000.

At the time he said: 'I know who did it. I know 
how it f****** happened, there were 23 hits in f****** two days. It was 
quite a lot of money.

'It wasn't that much. F*** knows. I don't know. Website, internet, I've not got a clue.'

Mr Gascoigne, once believed to be worth £14 million, reportedly said between £9,000 and £50,000 had been stolen.

In
a documentary aired by ITV in September he described the pain of knowing 
he might start drinking again even though he recognises it might kill 
him. 

Widely regarded as one of the most 
talented footballers of his generation, Gascoigne told film-makers he 
had been 'lucky twice' after almost dying from drink.

He
said: 'I hope I don't die through it. Because I won't get any 
sympathy... because well he was warned. At least I know if I did pass 
away through it I wouldn't be in this pain all the time.'

It was also reported in September that Mr Gascoigne spent £4,000 in just a few hours during a drunken betting spree.

Witnesses
said they saw the troubled England legend dropping bundles of £20 notes
at a bookmakers following a two-day drinking bender.

Staff at the Coral shop in Boscombe, near his Bournemouth flat, eventually had him ejected, according to reports.

An onlooker told the Daily Star Sunday that he was 'swaying' and a worker behind the counter said he has spent thousands.

Mr Gascoigne has battled alcoholism for many years and was sent to rehab in America in February.

The
£100,000 stay was organised and paid for by his host of famous friends 
including Radio 2 presenter Chris Evans and TalkSPORT presenter and 
former England cricketer Ronnie Irani.
