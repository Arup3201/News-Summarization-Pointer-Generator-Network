A Kenyan presidential candidate has accused Britain of meddling in the country's election process.

Uhuru Kenyatta - son of Kenya’s founding president, Jomo - accused the British high commissioner of 'shadowy, suspicious and rather animated involvement' in efforts to get a decision on how rejected ballots should be counted in the overall vote total.

Mr Kenyatta’s party also asked the high commissioner, Christian Turner, to explain why British troops attending a six-week training course near Mount Kenya before deploying to Afghanistan, arrived just before the vote.

On Monday, Kenyans held their first presidential vote since the nation’s disputed election in 2007 spawned violence that killed more than 1,000 people. Prime minister Raila Odinga and Mr Kenyatta are considered the top two contenders.

Kenyans were growing increasingly frustrated that the any announcement about who has won had still not happened 48 hours after polls closed. Kenya’s election commission was forced to abandon its electronic tallying system after it broke down.

Partial results on Tuesday had shown an early lead for Mr Kenyatta, though his percentage will drop when the rejected votes are counted in the total.

The statement from Mr Kenyatta’s party on Wednesday implied that the British high commissioner pressured the commission to make the decision on the spoiled ballots, thus ensuring a run-off.

The Kenyatta statement said his party awaits answers to such questions, and it called on supporters 'and the nation at large' to remain calm and peaceful.

The US has warned of 'consequences' if Mr Kenyatta wins because Mr Kenyatta is wanted by the International Criminal Court.

The Foreign Office said claims of British interference 'are entirely false and misleading'.
