It is the dream of many young children, the chance to be sheriff of their very own Wild West town. 

And it seems wannabe cowboys can make that dream come true after an entire Wild West town went up for sale in California, with a guide price of $900,000 (£600,000). 

For buyers who want to recreate their very own Western, the town boasts a general store, a saloon and a jail, as well as a real residence.

The Wild West Town in California even has an on-site barbershop, but you might have to hire in a professional

With the ticket office temporarily closed, there doesn't look like being any outward train journeys out of the Wild West

The two-bedroom house is ready to move in, and is decked out in beautiful Wild West memorabilia

On John Wayne Avenue stands the General Store, where you can tie your horse up outside and get the day's necessities

And wannabe sheriffs can also set up home in the town as there's a house two-bedroom house ready to move into. 

The town in Valley Center, San Diego, has been used for advertising and movies and is now up for grabs to be turned into a family home. 

All of the buildings - including a blacksmiths, a barbershop and a print shop have been furnished with Western antiques collected over the last 60 years. 

And the town's residential property has a stone fireplace and two wood burning stoves.

The interior is linked back to the days of rodeo and gunfights of the Wild West, but the furniture is exquisite and tasteful

Those who didn't obey the strict laws in the Wild West often met a grisly end - thankfully this graveyard is just an added 'decoration'

The Wild West Town in California will cost $900,000 (£600,000) and will provide a truly unique living experience

A quick dust around and you could make this your sheriff's office in the town found in Valley Center, San Diego

Valley Center is well in tune with its Wild West history.

Once a year, parts of the town are closed down for an event known as Valley Center Western Days. 

This event is traditionally held over the Memorial Day weekend and consists of a community parade, a festival at the Valley Center Community Center and the Valley Center Stampede Rodeo. 

Jalhouse Rock! For anyone who misbehaves, they may find themselves 'in the slammer', but at least they will get a bed to sleep on

On taking over the town, the ticket office can finally open for business at Bear Valley Station

After a hard day riding your horse around the plains, what better way to relax than have a beer in your own saloon

The interior of the bar is a tribute to the Wild West, but you might have to share a table with the Indian chief seated left

For the weeks leading up to the event, local organizations put on western-themed events and fundraisers. 

So there's no excuse after buying this property to be caught short when getting involved in the celebrations.
