Tim Bresnan has leapt to the defence of Matt Prior and insists the wicketkeeper said 'nothing wrong' in the team meeting which allegedly led to Kevin Pietersen's sacking by England.

Broadcaster Piers Morgan, a friend of Pietersen, accused Prior of saying 'F*** Flower' in that players' meeting - then accused the gloveman of being a 'hypocrite' and 'stabbing Pietersen in the back'.

But Bresnan took to Twitter to say: 'I was in that TEAM meeting and @MattPrior13 said nothing wrong. And only ever has the TEAMs best interests at heart. Undeserved criticism'.

Critic: Pietersen told Andy Flower the issues that the England players had with his management

All-rounder Ben Stokes echoed Bresnan's sentiments when he posted: 'Cant believe how much stick @MattPrior13 has got #laughable'.

But their former team-mate Graeme Swann says he is 'baffled' by the decision to jettison Pietersen.

'I'll be honest about Kevin Pietersen - myself and several other England players were not exactly members of his fan club during the Textgate scandal of 2012,' Swann wrote in The Sun.

'But I changed my opinion of him once he was reintegrated back into the England team towards the end of that year.

'He made a huge effort to improve his attitude around the dressing room. I saw or heard no issues with him in Australia this winter, his approach was exceptional.

'That's why I was baffled on Tuesday when he was effectively sacked as an England player.'

'Baffled': Graeme Swann says he did not see Pietersen do much wrong Down Under and even Prime Minister David Cameron (right with wife Samatha) had his say on the debate

Prime Minister David Cameron also waded into the row, insisting there is a 'powerful argument' for keeping Pietersen in the side.

Speaking
 on BBC Radio Lancashire, Cameron said: 'I am an enormous fan of Kevin 
Pietersen and I have had some of my most enjoyable times watching him 
tonking the ball all over the park.

'His
 average is remarkable. It is not often I have a sympathy for Piers 
Morgan but I thought he was making quite a powerful argument this 
morning on my radio.

'But I will let the England selectors pick the England team, I think I had better stay out of this one.'

The
 ECB have refused to clarify the details of the fallout from the team meeting because of legal
 complications, including confidentially clauses in the Pietersen 
settlement.

But this version
 of events from inside the dressing room tallies with that of the 
Pietersen camp, who maintain that their man was the only player prepared
 to tell Flower some home truths.

It
 also brings some context to the explosive tweets on Wednesday by 
broadcaster Morgan, KP’s flag-waver-in-chief, who claimed Prior 
told his team-mates at the summit that Flower was ‘behaving like a 
headmaster’ and that they were playing in a ‘schoolboy environment’.

According to Morgan, Prior added: ‘F*** Flower, this is our team.’

Morgan
 further tweeted, after challenging Prior to take legal action if the 
accusations were incorrect: ‘You stabbed Pietersen in the back, yet you 
agreed with him re Flower’s dictator style. Makes you a flaming 
hypocrite.

‘For the record, @MattPrior13 (Prior) led the England team meeting after Melbourne Test. And slaughtered Flower.’

Prior
 responded: ‘I don’t do this PR, spinning media rubbish, but I refuse to
 be attacked by a bloke that knows very little about what goes on in the
 England set-up apart from rumour, gossip and hearsay from certain 
individuals.

‘I’m not the 
kind of person to divulge what is said in team meetings, but all I will 
say is that Flower, Cook and the rest of my team-mates know exactly what
 I said and the way it was meant.’

Re-integrated: Team-mate Matt Prior posted this picture of Pietersen on Twitter in late 2012 with the caption: '"Re-integration complete. Well played".'

Ironically,
 Prior had acted as peacemaker when Pietersen was left out of the 
England team in 2012 following a number of issues over his contract.

But
 the wicketkeeper continued his attack on Morgan by saying: ‘There is no
 story here, just an attempt to knock someone who has only ever had the 
team’s best interests at heart and tried my best on and off the field to
 help the England cricket team.

‘I can hold my head up high in that knowledge!’
