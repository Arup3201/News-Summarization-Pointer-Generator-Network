An Olympic gold medal won by Jesse Owens at the infamous 1936 Berlin games is up for auction.

The American track star’s domination of multiple events infuriated German Chancellor Adolf Hitler and made him a star.

Mr Owens won four gold medals and set a record in the 100-yard dash during those Olympics.

‘Almost singlehandedly, Owens obliterated Hitler's plans,’ SCP Auctions partner Dan Imler said. 

‘You've got an African American, son of a sharecropper, grandson of slaves who overcame these incredible circumstances and delivered a performance for the ages,’ he added.

Despite his legendary performance, Mr Owens was unable to find work, and even gifted one of his gold medals to dancer and movie star Bill ‘Bojangles’ Robinson out of gratitude for helping him find work.

‘They formed a friendship and also a professional relationship,’ said Mr Imler. ‘Bojangles helped Owens get work in the entertainment field.’

Mr Owens worked as a band leader before soon returning home to work for Cleveland’s parks department.

Mr Robinson’s widow’s estate provided the medal for the auction, which is online only.

The whereabouts of the other three original gold medals is unknown.

Mr Owens arrived at the 1936 Olympics as one of many objects of scorn of the hateful dictator Mr Hitler.

The Nazi leader had grand visions of organizing the games to be a showcase of the superior genes and talent possessed by Aryans.

The Germans won a total of 89 medals, the United States’ 56 were second, but it was Mr Owens’ performance that made the German leader throw fits.

Mr Owens literally ran circles around the Germans – and roughshod over everyone else en route to his four medals.

‘The black community revered him for what he had accomplished,’ daughter Marlene Owens Rankins, 74, said.

The auction ends December 7.
