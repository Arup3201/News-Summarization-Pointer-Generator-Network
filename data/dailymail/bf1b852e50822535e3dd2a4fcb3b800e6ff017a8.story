England's Nile Wilson won gold in a dramatic high bar final which was decided on a tie-break after he was given the same score as team-mate Kristian Thomas.

Wilson was awarded the title due to his higher execution score as he and Thomas both scored 14.966, with Canada's Kevin Lytwyn winning bronze with 14.866.

It meant the 18-year-old won his first individual gold medal of the Commonwealth Games after claiming team gold, parallel bars silver and all-around bronze.

Only just: Wilson pipped his team-mate on countback after having a higher execution score overall

Scotland's Baines finished in fourth place, with Keatings in sixth after a fall.

Australia's Sean O' Hara was the first gymnast to compete but he lost momentum and came off the apparatus, remounting for a total that left him way off the pace.

Canada's Anderson Loran then missed a catch and fell to the mat before taking another tumble as he aimed to produce some big skills, although he won the approval of the crowd if not the judges as he again resumed his routine.

Wilson was up next and he nailed the first clean routine on the apparatus to put the pressure on Scotland's Keatings, who became the third man to hit the floor in the high-pressure finale.

Quadruple: Wilson added a first individual title to his gold, silver and bronze medals he had already won

Keatings, who saw off the challenge of England's Whitlock and Louis Smith to win pommel horse gold, resumed his routine and scored 13.366 to briefly move into silver medal position.

It was then the turn of Baines, who landed a clean routine of 14.566 to edge Scotland team-mate Keatings into bronze medal position.

England's Thomas scored the same tally as Wilson but the younger member of the England squad held on to gold medal position on a tie-break as he had a higher execution score.

Australia's Naoya Tsukahara finished fourth while Lytwyn claimed a last-gasp bronze, as Keatings fell away to sixth place.

Score: Nile Wilson scored 14.966, as did Kristian Thomas but he had lower execution marks than team-mate
