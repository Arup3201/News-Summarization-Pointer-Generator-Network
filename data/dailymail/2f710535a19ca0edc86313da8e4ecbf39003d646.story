'Overwhelmed': Robert De Vincenzi had been down his luck after Superstorm Sandy swept a 12ft wall of water into his home destroying all his belongings

Stood among the wreckage of his former home in Staten Island, Robert De Vincenzi must have felt down on his luck.

Days earlier a 12ft wall of water had swept into his property during Superstorm Sandy destroying his home and all his belongings.

But within a few days his luck was about to change with a single phone call.

Wagner
College in New York had been given a ring belonging to Mr De Vincenzi 
that he lost 35 years earlier while on holiday with a friend in the 
Bahamas.

A couple honeymooning in the Bahamas had found it encrusted in coral and wrapped in seaweed washed up on the shore.

Randy
Wilkinson and his bride Linda took the ring to a jeweller in their home 
state of Missouri who uncovered Mr De Vincenzi's name inscribed inside.

They
turned it over to Wagner College who tried to get in touch -
but Mr Vincenzi's phone number was disconnected for several days 
because of the storm.

When they finally managed to get through Mr De Vincenzi said he was 'overwhelmed' by the discovery.

'It
was 35 years ago,' he said. 'I was on vacation with my friend and we 
were in the water, splashing around, when the ring came off. How 
strange, the way God works.'

Hope: Robert De Vincenzi after being reunited with the Wagner College ring he lost in the Bahamas 35 years

After hearing about Mr De Vincenzi's circumstances, the newlyweds wrote him a touching letter expressing how pleased they were to have reunited him with the ring.

'We cannot imagine how you have been affected by Superstorm Sandy, and what you have already gone through,' wrote Mr Wilkinson.

'I remember when we were sitting on the beach, I told Linda that, more than likely, Sandy washed the ring up.

'After talking to you today and hearing a little about Sandyâ€™s impact on you, I am convinced that is the case.

'Maybe you lost your ring over 30 years ago so that I could be reminded that God cares about even the smallest things in our lives.'
