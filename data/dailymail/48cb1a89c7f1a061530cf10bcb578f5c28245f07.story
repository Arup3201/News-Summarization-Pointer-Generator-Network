The birth of the most eagerly anticipated baby of the decade is just days away.

So it comes as no surprise that designers worldwide are rushing to create bespoke gifts for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their newborn.

One company was so determined to impress the Royals that they roped in celebrity jewellery designer Theo Fennell to create the most lavish baby gift so far for the pregnant Duchess, worth a staggering £10,000.

But the jewel-encrusted, 18ct white gold charm bracelet isn't exactly as glamorous as it sounds, because it doubles as a nappy rash cream holder.

But will she use it? Theo Fennell has created a bespoke £10,000 charm 
bracelet that doubles as a nappy rash holder

Renowned jewellery designer Theo Fennell, who counts the Beckhams, Elton John and Madonna as his clients, was commissioned by Sudocrem to produce a bespoke bracelet that reflected the Sudocrem pot.

Modelled on the iconic Sudocrem pot with a closable lid, the company maintain that it will carry the perfect amount of the nappy rash cream in style. 

The designer: Renowned jewellery designer Theo Fennel says that his latest design will be going to a 'very good home'

Royal taste? It is hard to imagine the glamorous Duchess donning a replica of this Sudocrem tub on her wrist

When the initials are known they will be engraved onto a disc charm that will sit alongside the miniature pot.

Speaking about his latest commission, Theo said: 'I am thrilled to make this miniature pot and bracelet for Sudocrem.

'I understand it will be going to a very good home.'

The big day: The Duchess of Cambridge, 31, will give birth to the new third-in-line-to-the-throne in the private Lindo Wing, where Prince William was delivered in 1982

Theo also creates bespoke trophies and gifts for companies, charities and events such as The Italian Formula One Grand Prix, The Monaco Formula One Grand Prix, the Man of the Match Trophy for the FA Cup Final and the Nordorff Robbins Silver Clef Awards.

Sudocrem commissioned Theo Fennell to design the very same bracelet just over a year ago and auctioned it for the NSPCC.

'It raised over £20,000 and brought a lot of happiness. We decided to ask Theo to make another one for us because it was such a beautiful bracelet and we thought the Duchess would like it.

'However she must be inundated with lovely gifts so we've decided that auctioning it for one of her charities is better. In the spirit of giving it's about putting something back,' said a Sudacrem spokesman.

The Duchess of Cambridge, 31, will give birth to the 
new third-in-line-to-the-throne in the private Lindo Wing, where Prince 
William was delivered in 1982, and anticipation is building as members of the press began arriving ahead of the birth.

  The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge received a box of goodies from the Finnish social security service Kela containing condoms.

Former Australian prime minister, Julia Gillard, has knitted a kangaroo for the couple.Kate's uncle, Gary Goldsmith, will get the baby Chelsea football club shares. Then, when it’s a bit older, he will buy it a full tiny Chelsea strip.
