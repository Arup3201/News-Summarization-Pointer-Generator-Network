If you’re fed up of being fastidious about your depilation, you will be pleased to learn the hairy legs movement has arrived - and it's making waves on social media.

Women around the globe are saying ‘no’ to waxing and shaving, instead posting proud pictures of their fluffy limbs online.

One such online community, the Hairy Legs Club, is blazing a trail on tumblr, inviting women to post their photos to make a statement about social expectations of beauty.

The caption on this post reads: 'My dog doesn't care!'

Hot on the heels of the club, which has hundreds of posts, the 'Very Hairy Legs' blog has also launched on the site, where unshaven women of the world can unite against the razor.

In her opening statement, the blog's pioneer, Sarah, told her followers: 'This blog is dedicated to females with very hairy legs. Let our legs be the champions!'

And a flurry of pictures followed.

One blogger, 'Pupmami', writes simply 'Ginger hairy legs', while others leave a more inspirational message.

Along with an image of her unshaven legs, regular blogger 'Swankified' writes, 'I’m so glad I don’t feel ashamed of my natural body hair anymore!' - a sentiment echoed on hundreds of other posts.

'When I first stopped shaving my legs it took a while for me to feel confident about it,' Swankifield told the MailOnline. 'Seeing pictures of other women doing the same helped me get used to it.

'I guess I post mine now because I like them - I like the way they look and that they remind me I’m not obligated to do anything I don’t want with my body.'

The blogger adds: 'Also, it’s nice to get support from the online community, considering people outside don’t really approve.'

Judging by many of the other posts, that support and solidarity is felt my many.

‘You inspire me all so much…You are all stars for honouring yourselves!’ reads one post on the Hairy Legs Club blog along with a picture of bushy legs.

‘I have hairy legs, and, to be honest, I feel more feminine than ever!’ reads the caption beneath another.

A particularly poetic poster writes of her hirsute legs: ‘It just feels so nice to have them wave around in the pool or ocean.'

She adds: ‘Everyone around me thinks they’re gross, but I feel it’s important for me to grow them out not only for myself on my journey to self-love and acceptance, but also for other people who might be ashamed of theirs as I once.

'Good luck to everyone on here, you are 
all brave and beautiful people! This blog makes me feel a lot better in a
 society that portrays women as being hairless 99 per cent of the time!’

The hairy legs trend is also gaining traction on Facebook. The Women Against Non-Essential Grooming (WANG) page has attracted 1,405 members and counting.

Their profile mission statement explains their raison d’etre: ‘WANG believes that everyone should be free from coercive gendered bodily norms and should have absolute bodily autonomy.

‘We look forward to a day when people can present their bodies in whatever way they choose, free from political, social, and economic constraints!’

And who can argue with that. The question is…do you dare?
