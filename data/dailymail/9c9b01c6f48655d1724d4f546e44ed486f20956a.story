Britons are consuming more so-called legal high chemicals than any other nation in the European Union, according to the latest research by the United Nations.

A total of 670,000 people aged 15 to 24 have experimented with the substances, which imitate the effects of illegal drugs, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said.

UK use, which accounts for nearly a quarter of the EU total, led Poland, France, Germany and Spain in the top-five countries.

UNODC executive director Yury Fedotov has urged action to prevent the manufacture, trafficking and abuse of legal highs in the office’s World Drugs report.

Health risk: Legal high use is increasing at 'unprecedented levels' according to a UN report which showed the highest consumption in the UK

The UNODC warned that the substances are rapidly increasing at an 'unprecedented rate' and 'posing unforeseen public health challenges'.

For the year to April 2011, official figures showed that the most widespread legal high was mephedrone; however, its use fell after it was banned as a class B substance under the Misuse of Drugs Act.

Mephedrone turned out to be the third most abused substance after cocaine, on a par with ecstasy, the report said.

Last month, the Government’s drugs tsar warned that Britain is being swamped by a 'potentially dangerous' influx of legal highs.

Professor Les Iversen, chairman of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD), said he and his colleagues cannot keep tabs on all the substances available as there are now around 200 such chemicals flooding the European market.

Risks: The UNODC report has warned increasing use of such unknown substances risks 'posing unforeseen public health challenges'

Mr Iversen told a public hearing that dealers are dodging laws by dressing the drugs up as plant food and warned that overdose risks are 'clearly immense'.

He said the ACMD, which reviews substances and advises whether measures should be taken for preventing misuse, would be focusing on a man-made amphetamine called Benzo Fury and new LSD-like chemicals. 

Crime Prevention Minister Jeremy Browne said: 'The UK is leading the global effort to address the serious threat from "legal highs", adapting and innovating as new trends emerge.

'We have introduced temporary class drug orders, a swift legislative response to protect the public while our independent experts prepare advice.

'We are working with law enforcement agencies overseas to break down supply chains and reduce demand.

'We have led a new G8 agreement to share intelligence on ‘legal highs’, the impact they have on public health and their supply routes.

'Our Forensic Early Warning System and the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs continue to closely monitor the prevalence and availability of these substances.

'We remain vigilant to the threat and committed to removing harmful substances from UK streets.'
