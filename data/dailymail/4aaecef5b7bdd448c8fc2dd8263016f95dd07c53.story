Two quick-thinking sisters have been hailed as heroes after getting 26 people, including students, off a smoking school bus moments before it burst into flames.

Bettye Windom, 24, and Beth Insley, 29, were at a red light on a Mississippi highway last week when they saw clouds of smoke rising from the bus.

Fearing for the safety of the passengers, the Georgetown sisters jumped into action.

They followed the bus for a mile down Highway 28 in Copiah County, honking and screaming, before stopping their car in front it and forcing the driver to stop.

Within minutes of the women evacuating the 22 students, three chaperones and driver, the bus went up in flames.

'We knew we had to 
stop the bus, and the driver didn't see us,' Windom told The Good News blog. 'It took three minutes after we got everyone out for the bus to 
burn down.'

The Good News blog reported the sisters were driving home after buying a new car when they saw the smoking bus, a 2008 model from Thomas Built Buses.

'(Beth) started flagging them down. It 
took us probably a mile to get them to pull over,' Windom, a volunteer firefighter, told WAPT.

'We were
 running on the side of the bus and we had the flashers on. We were 
honking and screaming. My sister was out of the vehicle, out the window,
 screaming at him. We finally got in front of them and slammed on brakes
 to get them to get out of the bus.'

Windom, a postal worker, said she spared no thought for the new sedan when she and her sister slammed on the brakes in front of the bus.

'I would much rather save the kids than the vehicle,' she said. 'A life means a lot more.'

As the girls helped get the students and chaperones off the back of the bus, the driver tried to put out the flames with a fire extinguisher.

But, Windom said, the bus was engulfed in flames within three minutes of the evacuation.

Destroyed: Officials say an apparent mechanical failure caused the Claiborne County school bus (pictured) to ignite last week, with insurance appraisers saying it's a total loss

The students were making their way to Claiborne County after taking exit exams in Hattiesburg.

WAFB reported that school officials believe the cause of the fire was a mechanical failure. Insurance appraisers say it's a total loss.

Only one student was injured - she suffered a bruised shoulder during the evacuation.

Despite rescuing nearly 30 people from an imminent inferno, the sisters say they are not heroes.

'People are saying we're heroes, but that's silly,' Windom said. 'I'm just thankful everyone was okay.'
