James Packer's Crown has had to assure NSW authorities it won't deal with alleged underworld figure Stanley Ho in order to get approval for his Sydney Barangaroo casino.

The revelation is contained in a VIP Gaming Management Agreement between Crown Resorts and the NSW casino regulator.

The document had previously been blacked out but a motion from Greens MP John Kaye succeeded in having it made public on Thursday.

The agreement prevents Crown associating with Dr Ho who is accused of having organised crime links.

Mr Packer is understood to be in business with the Macau casino mogul's son Lawrence through the business Melco Crown.

'To the extent to which it is within its power to do so, Crown will ensure that it prevents any new business activities or transactions of a material nature between Stanley Huang Sun Ho or a Stanley Ho Associate and Crown, any of Crown's officers, directors or employees or any Crown Subsidiary,' the agreement reads.

Crown must also ensure Stanley Ho is prevented from acquiring any 'direct, indirect or beneficial interest in Crown, a subsidiary of Crown or a subsidiary of Melco Crown'.

Crown has also agreed to conduct quarterly searches on its businesses to make sure payments have not been made to Dr Ho.

Dr Kaye said the document shows the government has concerns the Barangaroo casino poses an organised crime risk.

'The government has effectively admitted they are concerned about triads, they are concerned about money laundering, they are concerned about money coming from prostitution, racketeering and drugs coming in through the Barangaroo casino,' he told reporters.

Law-enforcement officials in North America and Europe have long contended Dr Ho has co-operation with triads and criminal gangs that used Macau's casinos to launder money and supply prostitutes and drugs to wealthy businessmen.

Comment has been sought from Melco Crown.
