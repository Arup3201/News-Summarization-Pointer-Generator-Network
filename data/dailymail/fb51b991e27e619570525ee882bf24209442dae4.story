The mystery of the dog stolen from Sir Ian Botham’s family home has taken a dramatic turn with the arrest of his son’s estranged wife.

Sarah-Jayne Botham, 37, was arrested by police on suspicion of stealing Woody the spaniel and she has been released on bail pending further inquiries.

The pet, belonging to Liam Botham’s fiancée Emma Sayle, vanished last Sunday shortly after being seen with Mrs Botham outside her home, which is owned by the cricket legend. They were said to have been captured on CCTV together and a short time later Mrs Botham drove off in her car.

Missing: Woody disappeared from a private courtyard at former England cricketer Sir Ian Botham's home in Ravensworth, North Yorkshire

The mother-of-three has strenuously denied taking the dog or having any idea where he is.

All the CCTV evidence has been handed 
over to North Yorkshire Police by former rugby player Liam Botham, 34, 
and the couple are desperate to find the 15-month-old sprocker spaniel –
a cross between a springer and a cocker.

After discussing the investigation 
with police Mr Botham increased the reward for finding Woody to £3,000 
‘to show we are not messing around.’

‘Woody has never run off in his life,’ said Mr Botham.

Despite the arrest there have been no further developments in finding Woody.

A police spokeswoman said a 
37-year-old local woman was arrested at 10pm on Thursday night in 
connection with the incident. She was arrested in the neighbouring 
County Durham area and later released on bail.

Mrs Botham was not available for comment yesterday.

Woody spends most of his time living 
with Miss Sayle, 33, and Mr Botham in south-west London. But he has 
three children from his 14-year marriage and regularly spends time 
staying with his parents.

His ex-wife still lives in the former 
marital home in the grounds of Sir Ian’s property at Ravensworth, North 
Yorkshire. However, they are in the final throes of an acrimonious 
divorce and the decree absolute is due soon.

Miss Sayle, whose company Killing 
Kittens runs sex parties for open-minded adults, said she was 
‘devastated’ by Woody’s disappearance and is anxiously awaiting 
developments.

She said: ‘He is my little baby. 
Wherever I go he goes, he had done everything with me since he was 
born.’ Miss Sayle said the dog could not have just wandered off as the 
property is surrounded by a 5ft high wall and ‘he never goes off by 
himself.’

The family have printed ‘missing’ posters and distributed them to local residents.

Mr Botham, who is currently in 
Scotland with his father, said: ‘He has been taken as far as I’m 
concerned. I have my own ideas what happened and a lot of people think 
the same as I do

'We don’t want to accuse anyone. All 
we are saying is the CCTV is fairly conclusive – that Woody has not been
seen after being with my ex-wife. But I am not accusing her. She says 
she has no idea of where the dog is. We just hope Woody returns. That’s 
all I care about.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
