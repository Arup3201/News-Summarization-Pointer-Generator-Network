Louise Mulholland (pictured), 35, stole £84,000 from the Aldi store which she ran in Bootle, Liverpool 

A cocaine addict Aldi manager who kept wads of cash in her handbag and drove around in a 'flash' sports car has been jailed for stealing £84,000 from her own store.

Louise Mulholland, 35, was earning a £40,000 annual salary when she plundered the safety deposit box at the store in Bootle, Liverpool, to fund her cocaine habit and a luxury lifestyle. 

At the time, she drove around in a 'flash sports car' and lavished after-work drinks upon her colleagues.

Mulholland also carried around huge sums of money in her handbag and was described as being 'flash with cash', the court was told.  

Sentencing her to two-and-a-half years in jail, Judge Thomas Teague QC said Mulholland was a 'highly intelligent woman'. 

The court had heard how she managed to cover her tracks by falsely editing the deposit slips to account for the money she had taken.

He said: 'You were driving around in a fairly flash sports car and waving large sums of money around, almost literally.'

'You are an extremely capable highly intelligent woman of very considerable ability.

'If you had not resorted to dishonesty you might have gone far in the retail business.

'Unfortunately you became reckless, taking drink and drugs and went out of control.'

During the trial, Liverpool Crown Court was told how Mulholland had been manager at the Aldi store in St John's precinct in the city centre.

Prosecutor Andrew Ford said the theft took place in April 2012 when accounting records showed there should have been two weeks' takings in the safe of between £80,000 and £90,000.

But Mulholland had started banking the takings a week in arrears and had 'exploited the accounting vulnerability', the court heard.

Over the following months, she then 'doctored' details on the deposit slips to make up for the stolen money, the jury was told.

Mr Ford said there was evidence that she 'was flash with cash, had a sports car and cash wads in bank bands in her handbag'.

He added that she had always been keen to buy the drinks on nights out with colleagues and regularly withdrew large sums of money from cash points.

The court heard she was earning £40,000 and was living rent-free with her parents at the time.

'She lost control of proper responsibility for money and her colleagues, which is what Class A drugs can do,' Mr Ford said.

Mulholland had denied theft. She instead blamed sloppy procedures and the computer system for the altered accounts.

It was also only after trial that she confessed to a probation officer about her cocaine addiction.

Mulholland was convicted of two offences of theft. The court heard that, since the offences had been committed, she had received a 12-week suspended jail sentence for doctoring a provisional driving licence and passport.

They were discovered after she was stopped by police for driving erratically.
