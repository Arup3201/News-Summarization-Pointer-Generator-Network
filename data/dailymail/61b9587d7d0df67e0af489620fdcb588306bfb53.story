Mothers have a habit of embarrassing their children - and it seems that the Duchess of Cornwall is no different.

Camilla joked today that her food critic son, Tom Parker Bowles, is getting a 'little pot belly' from too much fine dining as she sampled some of Australia's most outstanding produce.

The royal was celebrating Australia Day with some of the country's top chefs and wine producers at an engagement in London when she made her slip.

During the central London event, Camilla also met with Strictly Come Dancing judge Darcey Bussell (above)

Retired ballerina Ms Bussell, who laughed and joked with the Duchess of Cornwall at the event, said: 'She's a big fan of Strictly and she's always keen to know how we are recovering from the show. It's lovely to see her'

She said fondly: 'He's always going to Australia, writing about food over there - he's developed a nice little pot belly.'

Tom is a Mail on Sunday food writer and last year released a successful new cook book Let's Eat Meat.

Camilla spent much of her time today chatting to guests including MasterChef host John Torode, telling him: 'I know that face from MasterChef, one of my favourite programmes.'

And she was all smiles as she spoke to Strictly Come Dancing judge Darcey Bussell, one of her favourite shows on television.

Darcey said: 'She's a big fan of Strictly and she's always keen to know how we are recovering from the show.

'It's lovely to see her here.'

Others 'Friends of Australia' at the event included Aussie chef Bill Granger, weathergirl Sian Lloyd, and writer Stanley Johnson, father of London mayor Boris.

The Duchess, whose late father, Bruce Shand, was a wine merchant, is something of a 'foodie' herself and champions several national campaigns, including British Food Fortnight.

Today she was treated to a cooking demonstration by Australian MasterChef runner-up Lynton Tapp, later sampling some wagyu beef fillets and raw kingfish.

She also tasted a selection of Australian wines at the central London event hosted by Australia's High Commissioner Alexander Downer and Tourism Australia.

In a short speech she told the guests: 'I have a son who's a foodie, quite a lot of you know, he writes a lot about food, and my father was in the wine business - so they are two things that are very, very close to my heart.'

'I've only visited Australia once – not because it's not the most amazing country – but because I hate flying.

'But coming and tasting that kingfish and that beef was out of this world - I just want to put it into a bag and take it for dinner, but I don't think I would be allowed to do that.'

After trying the food and wine, Camilla, who toured Australia with Prince Charles to mark the Queen's Jubilee in 2012, added: 'I hope to come and sample a lot more of it very soon.'

And she joked: 'I will stagger out of here now.'
