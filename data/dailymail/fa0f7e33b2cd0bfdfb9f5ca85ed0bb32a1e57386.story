Is there anything cuter than a sleeping newborn baby? Yes. Ten of them!

Baby photographer Sandi Ford has shared some images from her recent photo shoots to celebrate the arrival of spring and Mother's Day.

In the heart-warming collection of pictures the babies are captured snoozing peacefully on super soft rugs and blankets.

Sandi runs her company Bumps, Babes and Beyond Photography from a studio in Ealing, West London, where she adds dainty accessories to the dozing newborns she shoots, some of whom are just a few days old.

The photographer is a fan of natural light and says she likes to focus on the little details, fragility and tenderness of a newborn baby and encourage parents to use props and personal or sentimental items to provide a unique and personal touch to the pictures.

Sandi has three young children herself which she says helps her know how to get giggles from older children and how to soothe and relax a new arrival.

As well as newborns Sandi, whose work has appeared in Vogue and on Netmums.com, loves maternity shoots saying: 'Pregnancy is such an amazing time in a woman's life and we love to celebrate your beautiful body!'
