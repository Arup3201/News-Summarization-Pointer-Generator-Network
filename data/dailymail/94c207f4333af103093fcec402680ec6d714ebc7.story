A police officer who claimed to be an expert in detecting meth detained a man for 24 hours after mistaking red and blue Jolly Rancher sweets for the drug.

Love Olatunjiojo, 25, was arrested when officers searched him and a friend and discovered the 'rocks' in their possession.

But tests carried out in the NYPD lab revealed the red and blue 'crystalline rocks of solid material' were not narcotics but the popular boiled sweets.

Love Olatunjiojo from Brooklyn, was arrested when NYPD officers found blue and red 'rocks' on him and suspected they were meth. Tests revealed they were Jolly Rancher sweets

The Jolly Ranchers were bought at the It'Sugar sweet store in Coney Island

The New York Daily News
revealed the officer who arrested Mr Olatunjiojo confidently stated in
the criminal affidavit that he had professional training in the 
identification of methamphetamine.

Making
reference to Bryan Cranston's hit series Breaking Bad the lawyer 
representing Mr Olatunjiojo claimed the 25-year-old is nothing like the
meth-making lead character Walter White.

Mr
Smith, who filed a lawsuit this week in Brooklyn Federal Court, said: 
'I don't know if these cops have been watching Breaking Bad, but my 
client is not Walter White.'

His client and friend bought the sweets at the It'Sugar candy store in Coney Island last June.

Several
blocks from the sweets emporium, Mr Olatunjiojo and his friend were 
stopped by Officer Jermaine Taylor and several other officers, who 
searched the pair.

Lawyer Kenneth Smith, representing Love Olatunjiojo, said NYPD officers had been watching too much Breaking Bad and confused his client with character Walter Smith, pictured, played by Bryan Cranston

The complaint filed on behalf of Mr 
Olatunjiojo claims police told him it was 'only a matter of time before
they found something'.

It 
also claims that Officer Taylor said he carried out a field test to 
determine if the sweets were narcotics and got a 'positive' result.

Two
'red crystalline rocks of solid material' and four 'blue crystalline 
rocks of solid material' were sent to the NYPD lab for specialist tests 
and analysis.

Two days later the results revealed the six 'rocks' were in fact Jolly Rancher sweets, not an illegal drug, Mr Smith said.

Former US Drug Enforcement Administration agent Mike Levine said crystal meth (pictured) is produced in all kinds of colors: 'There's a type that's going around that looks like strawberry Pop Rocks candy'

The Brooklyn district attorney’s 
office waited until September 19 to seek dismissal of the charges against Mr

Olatunjiojo and his unidentified friend, who was also arrested.

Mike Levine, a former US Drug 
Enforcement Administration agent, said he could not comment on what 
suspicion led the cops to stop Mr
Olatunjiojo, but pointed out that crystal
meth and Jolly Rancher sweets look very similar.

'Crystal
meth is produced in all kinds of colors,' Mr Levine said. ‘There’s a type 
that’s going around that looks like strawberry Pop Rocks candy.'

'Dope dealers will disguise their product in any way you can imagine,' he added.

Mr 
Olatunjiojo is seeking unspecified compensation for the 24 hours he spent in police custody and court detention for a misdemeanor drugs charge.

The 25-year-old,
who declined to comment, claims he suffered emotional distress as a 
result of the alleged false arrest, illegal search and seizure and false
imprisonment.

A spokeswoman for the city Law 
Department said they were awaiting service of the court papers and would
look into the allegations.
