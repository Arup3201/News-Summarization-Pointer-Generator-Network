QPR have made enquiries for Toulouse right-back Serge Aurier.

The 21-year-old is wanted by Arsenal while Tottenham have also shown interest. Toulouse want £7m for Aurier and that could be too rich for QPR.

Wanted: Aurier's performances in Brazil, where he provided two assists in his first game, have drawn attention

On the move: The full back (right) looks certain to leave Toulouse, but the French club want £7m for him

Aurier had hinted that he may be on his way to Arsenal, and his impressive World Cup perfomances for the Ivory Coast have only served to boost his value.

Gunners striker Chuks Aneke has joined Belgian side Zulte
 Waregem on a three year deal.

The 20-year-old midfielder was a free 
agent after leaving Arsenal and had held talks over a possible move to 
Leeds.

Deadline: QPR have told Real Sociedad to make a decision about Esteban Granero (left) in the next two weeks

Replacement: Toulouse are keen on experienced Fulham full-back John Arne Riise

Toulouse, meanwhile are keen on free agent John Arne Riise.

Premier League newboys QPR have also set Real Sociedad a deadline of July 10 to make a decision on signing Esteban Granero for £4m. Sociedad would prefer another season loan.
