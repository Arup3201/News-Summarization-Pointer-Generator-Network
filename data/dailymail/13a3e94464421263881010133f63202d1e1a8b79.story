Yaya Toure's absence was a blessing disguise for Manchester City as Frank Lampard justified his place against Bayern Munich. 

So says former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes, who believes Toure's below-par displays in Europe have been hampering City's progress.

Sergio Aguero scored a hat-trick as Manuel Pellegrini's men came from behind to beat Bayern 3-2 at the Etihad, but Scholes says Lampard was more than worthy of his spot.

He told ITV: 'Toure has been a problem in the Champions League. For all his ability going forward he doesn't really try getting back.

'I thought Lampard was excellent and used the ball well. He was a goal threat and had some good shots from outside the box. 

'He made some good runs and if something had fell better for him he could've had a goal.

'He had a fantastic night and probably deserved to play ahead of Toure from what we've seen from him in the Champions League.'

Former City defender Joleon Lescott believes the last-gasp win can kick-start City's stuttering campaign.

He said: 'That win can turn their season and boost them in the league and kick them on.'
