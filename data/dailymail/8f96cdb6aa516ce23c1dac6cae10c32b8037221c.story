Fun and politicians are not words usually found together.

But Labour bigwigs set aside their conference agendas and speech notes in Brighton to show their lighter side, and throw some shapes on the dancefloor.

Power couple Ed Balls and Yvette Cooper were among those to step into the limelight and show they have still got it when it came to fancy footwork, at the Diversity Night event, hosted each year at the party conference by Labour MP Keith Vaz.

It was no doubt a welcome distraction for the party hierarchy from the explosive revelations contained in the memoirs of former Labour spin doctor Damian McBride.

Wearing floral garlands, and with a Bhangra beat in their ears, Mr Balls and Ms Cooper proved to be no shrinking violets as they strutted their stuff.

Not to be outdone however, Mr Vaz also joined in with the dancers and showed he had a few hidden moves of his own, with arms outstretched.

Less generous observers may describe  some of these conference-based gyrations  as the dreaded 'dad dancing', which appears to afflict those north of 40.

But with the political classes tempered by the slings and arrows of public life, they appeared immune to any self-consciousness as they got into the swing of things.

Others to attend the conference shindig included Shadow Energy Secretary Caroline Flint and Shadow Culture Secretary Harriet Harman.
