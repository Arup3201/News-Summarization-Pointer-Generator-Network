A Florida mother will find out today if she will go to jail over the tragic death or her two-year-old daughter who was found dead in her bed after swallowing an oxycodone pill.

Tiffany Mitchell, 29, of Spring Hill, could face as many as 13 years in prison for the death of Kaylynn two years ago.

Prosecutors say Mitchell left an oxycodone pill on her nightstand and that the brown-haired, blue-eyed girl found and swallowed it while Mitchell was taking a shower.

Kaylynn was found dead in her bed on January 31, 2011.

'Guilty': Tiffany Mitchell, 29, of Spring Hill, Florida, awaits sentencing today after pleading guilty in the death of her daughter Kaylynn, 2, who was found dead in her bed after eating an oxycodone pill

Tragic: Kaylynn is thought to have found her mother's oxycodone pill on the nightstand and swallowed it while Mitchell was taking a shower

Mitchell pleaded guilty last month to charges of aggravated manslaughter of a child.

Her lack of a criminal record made it possible to cap her sentence at 13 years, but Mitchell says she must accept responsibility in Kaylynn's death.

‘I shouldn't have ever brought a pill like that into my house,’ she told Tampa Bay Times.

The devastated mother, who also has two sons, Shawn, 10, and Dylan, 8, said the sentencing would not change the way she feels about the accident.

‘Whether it's probation or prison, I'll suffer every day for the rest of my life.’

The prosecutor said a prison term is justified, but is struggling to decide on how many years she should get.

‘There's no formula you get to follow,’ said Assistant State Attorney Donald 'Sonny' McCathran.

‘These are the cases that are a lot harder to call,’ he told Tampa Bay Times.

'Blue': The girl was found dead by her mother the next morning, who said her body was all blue and cold

Devastated: Mitchell says regardless of the sentencing, she will 'suffer every day for the rest of my life'

The day before her daughter died, Mitchell picked up Kaylynn in Brooksville after she had spent two days at her father's home.

The father, Kraig 
Broshears, 32, of Brooksville, says he forgives Mitchell, but that 13 
years in prison isn't long enough.

‘She
took a life by being irresponsible. She'll have time with her boys when
she gets out. I have to wake up every day and not see my daughter's 
face,' he told Tampa Bay Times.

Mitchell and a boyfriend took the children shopping, had dinner and went out for ice cream.

At
her mobile home south of Brooksville, Mitchell tucked Kaylynn into bed 
and put on a Dora the Explorer movie. Mitchell took a shower and checked
on Kaylynn about 10. She seemed fine.

The night before: Kaylynn had been tucked into bed by her mother who put on a Dora the Explorer movie for her. She was found dead the next morning with high levels of oxycodone in her system

About 6am the next day, Mitchell found Kaylynn blue and cold to the touch. Paramedics could not revive her.

The following month, a preliminary medical examiner's report showed Kaylynn had a high level of oxycodone in her system and so a criminal investigation began.

‘I was devastated,’ Mitchell said. ‘For months, I wanted to know what happened to her, and I almost didn't believe it.’

She told detectives she got an 80-milligram oxycodone pill from the boys' paternal grandmother for menstrual cramps.

She said she left the pill on the nightstand in her bedroom and took a shower. When she came out, it was gone.

The
state Department of Children and Families sought a court order to place
her two sons in protective custody. The judge denied the petition.

Upset: Broshears said his ex-girlfriend, Mitchell, took his daughter's life because she was 'irresponsible'

Mitchell admits she used to smoke marijuana and occasionally took oxycodone but insists she's not addicted to painkillers.

Mark Tousignant, who helped raise Mitchell since age 12, said she is a caring, responsible mother.

‘She's their rock,’ he said. ‘She's never been in a state of mind where she can't take care of her children or herself.’

Mitchell was arrested July 12, 2011

'Works hard': Mitchell, center, with her sons Shawn, 10, right, and Dylan, 8, at their home in Spring Hill. The boys said their mother worked hard for them

The youngest boy, Dylan, said of his mother that she ‘works hard for us'.

Mitchell was with the boys' father, Max Snyder of Spring Hill, for nine years. 

If Mitchell goes to prison, her sister Angel will assume her role.

‘I know she would treat them just as I do and give them the love that they need,’ said Mitchell.
