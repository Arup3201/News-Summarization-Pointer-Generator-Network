Anti-rape campaigners have slammed a 'terrifying' website which publishes articles and blog posts by men allegedly condoning the sexual assault of women by their husbands.

Return of The Kings is an American website with more than 6,000 monthly subscribers and hundreds of men posting comments beneath articles composed by contributing writers.

Among 'sexist' articles it has published is one titled Five Lines That Potential Wives Cannot Cross.

Critics have blasted the post as 'amounting to an incitement of rape'.

'Terrifying': Anti-rape campaigners have slammed an article posted online which instructs men to map out 'red lines' for potential wives

The write defended the section titled 'You don't reject me, ever' as attempting to have 'humour value' and 'offer advice' 

The article, written by a former Australian columnist posting under the pseudonym Hesse Kassel, is a list of five rules the writer says men must impose in a relationship to ensure it succeeds.

Among its guidelines is 'You don't reject me, ever' - instructing men never to allow prospective partners to refuse them sex. 

'Under no circumstance can you accept the idea that she gets to choose if or when to satisfy you or choose to sabotage your joint fertility,' it reads. 

'Only give sex when it suits you.  You control the time and frequency of sex, not her.

'The obvious exception to this is the first time you have sex. Typically she will control the timing of that for obvious reasons. 

'From the second time onward, any poorly-reasoned denial is a red flag.'

The article has been slammed as 'terrifying' and 'misogynistic' by campaigners shocked that such attitudes exist in modern society'. 

Siobhan Ames-Bell, who waived her anonymity after seeing her stepfather jailed for assaulting her to campaign on behalf of rape victims, said the article 'clearly' condoned rape. 

'Saying something is all part of the thought process. The fact they believe this shows they can act on it. 

Siobhan Ames-Bell, who was raped by her stepfather, said the article incites sexual attacks

'These should be monitored. Anybody who acts on these views has commited rape in my eyes.

'Sex is a choice . When both are not in consent it's rape.'

Rape Crisis, the country's leading victim support charity, described the views presented in the article as 'terrifying'.  

'This entire article is terrifying as is the idea that there is any sort of market for this kind of material in the 21st century,' said Katie Russell.

'The views expressed throughout are not only deeply outdated but also profoundly misogynistic.

'The writer unapologetically, aggressively and repeatedly advises men to enslave and dehumanise women.

'He is incredibly misguided and cynical in his apparent view that only a relationship or marriage based on power, control and abuse can ever endure.

'Most seriously and alarmingly of all, however, the first on the writer’s list of ‘rules’ amounts to an incitement to rape. 

'Someone who "refuses to take no for an answer" from their partner and has sex with her or him anyway is a rapist.' 

The writer, who declined to give his real name, defended the article, saying: ''The post aims to have some humor value but also include useful advice.

'It was only my second blog post and I may or may not have achieved that aim.

'If you read the post carefully you will see that it doesn't say that a woman should be forced to comply. 

'It merely says that a man should choose not to marry a woman who displays certain behaviors.

'The post did not incite, condone or so much as discuss rape, even in jest.' 

Almost 700 comments have been posted beneath the article on the website, the majority of which written by internet users claiming to be men and in support of StrongSloth's views. 

The website, which describes itself as 'a small but vocal collection of men in America today who believe men should be masculine and women should be feminine' has been criticised in the past for controversial content. 

Last November an article titled 'Five reasons to date a girl with an eating disorder' was accused of trivialising anorexia and bulimia by encouraging men to target sufferers as they 'cost less' and 'her obsession over her body will improve her overall looks'. 

Return of the Kings declined to comment when approached by MailOnline.
