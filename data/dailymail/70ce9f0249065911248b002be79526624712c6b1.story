He has been described as 'the most wanted man on planet earth'.

But it's not just the U.S. government that is desperate to get its hands on fugitive whistleblower Edward Snowden.

The NSA leaker, who has spent the past 39 days in a Russian airport before being granted temporary asylum yesterday, has been inundated with offers from employers - as well as women looking for love.

Snowden's lawyer Anatoly Kucherena revealed that a series of women have been trying to make contact with the 30-year-old.

But America's most wanted man is not being lured by the advances, according to the 
Russian senator who has been fielding the requests for Snowden's 
attention.

Mr Kucherena told newrepublic.com said: 'He told me, "Anatoly, I still miss my girlfriend".'

He added: 'I have to say he's getting
a lot of job offers coming in. Offers from journalists to work 
together, and the like. I've passed them on to him, he'll make the 
decision himself'.

Out: Edward Snowden has left the Moscow airport where he had been living for the past month

Snowden's new-found popularity among 
local women is unlikely to distract from the diplomatic storm brewing 
between Russia and the U.S.

Andrew Wood, British Ambassador to
Moscow from 1995 to 2000, said Russia had deliberately snubbed the U.S. by granting Snowden temporary asylum in retaliation for perceived diplomatic attacks on its human rights record.

He told CNN: 'What is in it for 
Moscow? A bit of fun of course, for one thing.

'The Soviet and now 
Russian habit has always been to answer criticisms of their conduct with
the playground insult "and you're another".

'Snowden in transit through Moscow was
a chance to posture as a defender of human rights in answer to Western 
-- for them most woundingly U.S. -- comments on the recent Russian 
record.'

The White House said that in the wake
of Russia granting NSA leaked Edward Snowden temporary asylum, the 
Obama administration is 'evaluating the utility' of a planned September 
stop in Russia for bilateral talks with Vladimir Putin.

And senators on both sides of the political aisle lashed out at Russia, calling for a re-examination of U.S.-Russian relations.

WikiLeaks tweeted that 'Edward Snowden was granted temporary asylum in Russia for a year and has now left Moscow airport under the care of WikiLeaks' Sarah Harrison.'

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said during his daily briefing that the administration is 'extremely disappointed' with Russia's move, and suggested that a Moscow discussion with Putin before the St. Petersburg G-20 summit could be in jeopardy.

But he added that the U.S. continues to talk with Russian officials in the hope that Russia will 'expel' Snowden and 'return him to the United States.'

Exit: Airport security staff secured an area yesterday in preparation for Snowden to leave the airport at last

Snowden, who has admitted to 
providing vast details of the top-secret spying programmes performed by 
America, collected while he worked on assignment at a Hawaii facility 
run by the National Security Agency.

Snowden
had been living in the airport since he arrived in Moscow, following 
his leak of classified intelligence documents to The Guardian newspaper.

His
Russian lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said on Thursday : 'I have just handed
him the documents from the Russian Federal Migration Service. They 
allow him to leave the airport.'

He added: 'I have just seen him off. He has left for a secure location. Security is a very serious matter for him.'

Gone: Snowden's lawyer Anatoly Kucherena announced that his client had been granted asylum

Snowden slipped out of the airport in a taxi without being spotted by the dozens of reporters and photographers who have camped out in the airport for weeks.

'He is the most wanted man on planet Earth,' his lawyer said. 'What do you think he is going to do? He has to think about his personal security. I cannot tell you where he is going.

'I put him in a taxi 15 to 20 minutes ago and gave him his certificate on getting refugee status in the Russian Federation. He can live wherever he wants in Russia. It's his personal choice.'

The 30-year-old has apparently agreed not to disclose any more classified information as a condition of his remaining in Russia.
