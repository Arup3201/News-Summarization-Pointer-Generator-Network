A mission to Mars's 'dark' moon Phobos could yield our first evidence of alien life, a professor has claimed.

'A sample from Phobos, which is much easier to reach than the Red Planet itself, would almost surely contain Martian material blasted off from large asteroid impacts,' said Jay Melosh of Purdue University.

'If life on Mars exists or existed within the last 10 million years, a mission to Phobos could yield our first evidence of life beyond Earth,' says Melosh.

Nasa said this month that Mars's moons could be a cheap, easier target for future Mars missions.

‘One of the big scientific questions is 
how did life spread,’ says professor Jay Melosh. ‘In our solar system a 
lot of exchange that takes place - it's quite possible life started on 
Mars and came to Earth.'

Could life 'hop' between worlds in a solar system in the form of living microbes carried through space on rocks?

There's also been a great deal of discussion about the possible spread of life in the universe from star to star.’

One of the least reflective bodies in 
the solar system, Phobos also orbits Mars below the synchronous orbit 
radius.

This means that it moves around Mars faster than the planet 
itself rotates.

The planet has two moons, Phobos and 
Deimos, and has an average distance from Earth of 78million kilometres, 
but can come as close as 55.7million kilometres.

 rocks and Mars meteorites have been found on Earth, which led Melosh to
 previously suggest living microbes could be exchanged among planets in a
 similar manner.

Melosh said a more extended solar system would be needed for exchange of materials among planets.

‘None
 of the solar systems that have been found so far would have 
opportunities for exchange of life among the different planets like what
 our own solar system offers,’ he said.
