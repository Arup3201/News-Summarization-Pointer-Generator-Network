The GB team face Turkey, Liechtenstein and quite a strong Ukraine team in a bid to try to reach the higher levels of the Fed Cup.

The task will be all the harder because Laura Robson is absent with wrist trouble and while she is hoping to return to the tour to play smaller events next month that is still not certain.

Murray said: ‘She’s obviously not played for a year and I don’t think we should expect too much. I think we just need to give her time to play herself back in. She’s obviously chomping at the bit to get back but she realises more than anybody that you just have to be patient and follow the orders of the doctor and the physios. The thing with a wrist injury is that you can still work very hard on your physical conditioning while you’re not necessarily able to play as much.'

While Great Britain is going through an embarrassingly fallow period in junior tennis Murray has at least been heartened by the performance in Australia of Katie Swan, a 15-year-old from Bristol who was overnight playing in the semi-finals of the junior event.

‘She’s a good athlete, got a very good mind. She’s got a very good foundation to her game already, strong serve, strong forehand. But I think it’s her calmness and her ability to stick to a task that impresses me.

‘I sat on the chair with her during the Maureen Connolly (under 18) Trophy last year when we played against the United States at New Haven. She beat the No 1 and 2 for the States and came from a set down in both of them. She was able to process the tactics and information and stick with them against girls who were a couple of years older than her and very much more experienced. That was when I realised, we’ve got a player on our hands here.’
