Rafael Nadal has withdrawn from the Paris Masters ahead of the tournament's start on Monday for 'personal reasons', the French Tennis Federation announced on Friday.

The 14-times grand slam champion warned last week that he could miss the end of the season because of appendicitis, and he will be replaced in the Paris draw by fellow Spaniard Pablo Andujar.

World number eight Marin Cilic and Latvia's Ernests Gulbis have also withdrawn from the tournament because of injuries.

Nadal has only competed in three tournaments since Wimbledon because of a wrist injury

Nadal's exit throws his participation into doubt for next month's ATP World Tour Finals in London.

He is playing in Switzerland this week, only his third tournament since Wimbledon due to a wrist injury, but is on antibiotics for appendicitis, which will eventually require surgery.

The draw for the Paris Masters takes place later on Friday.
