Chris Gayle produced another spellbinding innings as the West Indies completed a record chase in a Twenty20 international to seal their three-match series against South Africa.

Gayle followed up his 77 from 31 balls in the first game of the series by smashing 90 from 41 balls - an innings containing nine fours and seven sixes - as South Africa's 231 for seven was chased down in spectacular style with four balls and four wickets to spare.

West Indies' remarkable victory at Johannesburg's New Wanderers ground gave them an unassailable 2-0 lead and left South Africa wondering just how to stop Gayle and company.

The reply removed India's 211 for four against Sri Lanka in 2009 from the record books as the highest successful chase in T20 history and South Africa could be forgiven for being shell-shocked after Faf du Plessis become only his country's second batsman to score a T20 century.

Du Plessis came to the wicket when Morne van Wyk fell to Sulieman Benn in the first over and proceeded to take the West Indies attack apart.

The 30-year-old hit the second-fastest T20 century from 46 balls and ended up with 119 from 56 deliveries, smashing 11 fours and five sixes before finally picking out Bravo in the deep off Jason Holder.

It was the third highest international T20 score and Du Plessis had dominated the innings to such an extent that David Miller (47) was the only other batsman to exceed 20.

Bravo (two for 32) and Holder (two for 40) were the pick of the West Indies bowlers but South Africa knew they had never lost a T20 international defending a 180-plus score before.

But the West Indies made a savage reply to their daunting run chase, losing Dwayne Smith (17) leg before to Marchant de Lange but reaching an incredible 86 for one in their six-over powerplay with Kyle Abbott, in particular, in the firing line as he conceded 68 runs from his four overs.

Man-of-the-match Gayle was at his violent best and had explosive support from Marlon Samuels as the pair put on 152 in 65 balls for the second wicket.

South Africa finally broke the partnership when Gayle nicked David Wiese to wicket-keeper Van Wyk and Samuels soon departed for 60 from 39 balls to the same bowler.

Wiese finished with figures of three for 43 after removing the big-hitting Kieron Pollard cheaply but Andre Russell (14) and Bravo (10) made valuable contributions before Darren Sammy's unbeaten 20 from seven balls saw the visitors over the line.
