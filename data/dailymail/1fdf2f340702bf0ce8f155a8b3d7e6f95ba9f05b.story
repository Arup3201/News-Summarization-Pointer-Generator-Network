Katie Couric had to rebuff the unwanted sexual advances from the much-older, and eight-times married, talk show legend Larry King following a horrible date, she revealed last night.

The two went for dinner at an Italian restaurant in Washington, D.C. about 25 years ago and afterwards King drove them back to his apartment where he tried to put the moves on her, she said during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!

'So we sat there and what can I say, he lunged,' Couric said, as Kimmel cracked up and interjected, 'Incredible.'

No chemistry: King and Couric, seen here together in 2011, went on a date about 25 years ago where King tried to put the moves on the up-and-coming journalist

Couric, now 56, said their one and only date took place when she was about 30-years-old and during a time when she decided to be more adventurous in her love life.

'I was going through this period of my life that I was going, "I'm going to go out with anyone who asks me because you learn something every time.' "

After King, who has famously been married eight times, met her at a restaurant and later called her to ask her out.

'And I thought well that would be really interesting,' she said of her reason for saying yes.

She said King, now 79-years-old, came to her apartment to pick her up driving a Lincoln Town Car and then they went to dinner.

'They put us right next to each other like they do with all the men and their 'nieces.'

'He had ordered the veal poached in chicken stock because he had just had quadruple bypass, which was hot,' Couric joked.

Back in the day: These pictures of Couric and King are from 1991, around the time they went out on a terrible date together to an Italian restaurant in Washington, D.C.

The rest of the meal went 'nice enough' Couric said, but she was soon thrown for a shock when she realized he wasn't taking her back to her apartment.

'I go, 'Larry, where are we going' and he goes, 'My place.''

'I was like, 'Oh mother of God.' I was like 'Dear, Cosmo what do i do?' I was only 30, I could not figure out how to extricate myself from it.'

Shock: Couric has a terrified look as she tells the audience how she felt when she realized she was going back to King's bachelor pad

'So we go to his apartment in Roslyn [Virginia] and we walk in and its covered in proclamations for  'Larry King Day' and keys to every city in the country. That was sexy!'

Soon after they got there, King made his advance towards her, which she quickly rebuffed, she said.

Better times: Couric doesn't seem to be under the duress she felt while riding in King's Lincoln back to his Virginia home

'I started laughing a little because the whole situation was like out of a bad Lifetime movie.

'So I said 'Larry, you're such an interesting, nice man but I would like to meet someone a little closer to my age.'

'He said, 'That's okay cause when I like, I really like.''

All smiles now: King and Couric have remained friends despite their awkward date together 25 years ago

King, who has been married to Shawn Southwick since 1997, has a totally different recollection of getting shot down.

'We went out to dinner, a nice Italian restaurant, we drove home, thought we were kind of romantic, we get to her door, in the apartment house and she said, 'Oh, i have a roommate,'' he said in 2009.

'Then I kissed her goodnight and that was that. And we became friends ever since,' he said.

Current love: King has been married to Shawn Southwick since 1997. They filed divorce papers in 2010 but both later withdrew them. It his eighth marriage, and longest lasting one

Couric also revealed last night how Michael Jackson once bizarrely asked her on a date after he rejected her request for an interview.

'Can you imagine going home to my daughters who were then about 8 and 4, saying, ‘Honey, Girls. I’m going out on a date with Michael Jackson,' she said.

'I just thought it would be too weird. The tabloids would go crazy and I didn't need that.'
