A brown snake gave swimmers and sunbathers on a NSW north coast beach a bit of scare when it came slithering out of the surf between the red and yellow flags.

When lifeguards started blowing on their whistles to evacuate people out of the water at One Mile, beach goers initially thought the snake was a shark.

But as it swam closer to the shore it soon became clear it was a 1.5-metre brown snake, the Great Lakes Advocate reported.

A brown snake swam between the red and yellow flags on the beach, which animals experts say is unusual

Olivia Moffatt were among those on the sand soaking up the sun on Tuesday.

'The snake travelled out of the water and remained on the shore for a while until waves washed up against it,' she said.

'Raising its head, it headed for shade towards the lifeguard trailer and happily sat there until again moving up along the beach to the bush. 

'On the way, as we were leaving, the snake began heading back down towards the sea at a quicker pace, but was not in the ocean as we left.'

The incident happened on Tuesday and swimmers had to be evacuated from the water as lifeguards dealt with it

Great Lakes  supervisor for lifeguards Simon Lee told Daily Mail Australia in the 20 years he had been with the Surf Life Saving organisation he had not seen anything like this before.

He has been a lifeguard for the last six years. 

Mr Lee said the snake was just metres from the shore, which was 'very unusual for the snake'.

'I've never seen a snake rock up like that,' he said.

'I've seen penguins, lots of dolphins, turtles and seals, but never a snake before.

'It was a bit of shock... We didn't want to get in its way.

'[I heard] some people say they didn't know if it was better or worse that it was a snake instead of a shark.' 

Swimmers were evacuated out of the water until the snake was off the beach

Mr Smith said it was unusual for snakes to be in the water and he had only ever caught three on a beach in his 15 years living in the area

Mr Lee said the snake, with the assistance of local snake catcher John Smith, eventually retreated to the south of the beach into the bush area.

Mr Smith had to instruct lifeguards over the phone because he did not have a vehicle to get out to the beach.

'I told him [the lifesaver] to walk behind it and keep walking, don't panic him... he'll eventually go away,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'If it has an escape route, it will sense you behind it and it will just keep going.

'They are more scared of you, if you start harassing a brown snake it will defend itself.'

Mr Smith said it was unusual for snakes to be in the water and he had only ever caught a few on a beach in his 15 years living in the area.

'They're not a lover of water, so they don't normally go into water unless they have to,' he said.

'He was probably trying to get away from something… because the lifesaver said he came out of the surf.'  

A photo of the snake was posted on the Fairfax Media newspaper's Facebook page and it sparked an outpouring of stories from its readers about their own experiences with snakes.

One joker made a tongue-in-cheek post with a photo of Tony Abbott in his infamous 'budgie smugglers' and the words: 'Here's another snake at the beach.'

According to local resident June Southwell, Tuesday's incident follows another 'a few weeks ago' where a brown snake was spotted just outside One Mile Surf Club.

Ms Southwell posted on social media saying: 'The very brave surf livesaver gave it a squirt from the hose and it slithered back to the dune.'
