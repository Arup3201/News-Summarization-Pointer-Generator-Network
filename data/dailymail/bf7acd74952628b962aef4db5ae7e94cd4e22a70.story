A headteacher has launched a crackdown on anti-social behaviour by ordering parents to stop swearing and smoking outside the school gates.

Liz Mulcahy, head of Felmore Primary in Basildon, Essex says local people near to the school had complained about parents congregating at the gates and using bad language.

And in a school newsletter sent to parents before the Christmas break, Mrs Mulcahy advised those coming to collect children to be considerate of local residents.

Parents whose children go to Felmore Primary School in Basildon, pictured, have been ordered to stop swearing and smoking at the school gates 

She wrote: 'We have had complaints made from members of our local community about parents gathering around the school gates in the morning and at home tim.

'The complaints are about blocking the pavements, having to walk through cigarette smoke and also the use of bad language.

'Please be considerate of local residents - it is a community school and we are part of that community. Thank you.'

Not only have parents also been told to stop smoking and swearing, they have also been asked to keep the pavements clear as pedestrians have been forced into the road to pass groups.

School business manager Linda Olisse explained: 'We are aware of the issue and we are asking out parents to be courteous to our neighbours.

'Parents do congregate there at the end of the day.

'Obviously there is no smoking on our premises, so I suppose they are doing it outside on the public highway.

'I think residents are then having to walk through people who are smoking and we have had the police community support officer come along and have a little chat now and again.'

Keith Bobbin, borough councillor for Pitsea North West said there had also been problems in the past with parents parking in the road and blocking access to a nearby sheltered housing complex.

He added: 'There is a problem around there and it really needs to be patrolled by community police at the time when they are going in and out of school.

'It is a dangerous little area because it is a busy road.

'They had been blocking visitors going into the elderly people's home.

'Something needs to be done and we need co-operation between the police and the community.'
