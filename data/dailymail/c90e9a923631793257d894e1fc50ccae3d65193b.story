Derbyshire have strengthened their bowling options for the NatWest T20 Blast with the signing of Australian quick Nathan Rimmington.

The Melbourne Renegades paceman will represent the county for the entire Twenty20 campaign, joining Kiwi Martin Guptill and Sri Lanka's Tillakaratne Dilshan as an overseas player at the County Ground.

Derbyshire's elite performance director Graeme Welch said: 'Nathan brings a wealth of experience bowling at the death which will be vital as we look to progress in the NatWest T20 Blast.

'People will have watched him in the Big Bash and know the quality he will bring to the side.

'Not only will he be a valuable asset at the end of the innings, he will also provide us with a proven strike bowler with the new ball.

'The club are working on bringing Nathan over early in order for him to be available to play league cricket from April which will be an ideal way to get him match fit, settled and ready to go for the first game in May.'

The right-armer has claimed 65 wickets in 59 Twenty20 games with career-best figures of five for 27.

'I'm really looking forward to joining up with the Derbyshire squad for the NatWest T20 Blast,' he said.

'I want to play my part, both on and off the field, as we look to get in the mix for a quarter-final place and more.'
