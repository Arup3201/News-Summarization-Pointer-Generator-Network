It could soon be possible to closely examine some of the coldest items in the universe 'indefinitely' due to a breakthrough in imaging techniques.

Up until now, studying matter at temperatures close to absolute zero was difficult because the light energy from the cameras caused the matter to heat up and be destroyed. 

Physicists from Nottingham have created a computer program that not only reveals for the first time exactly how this energy behaves, it helps create a way of using this energy to keep the particles cold.

When boson particles are cooled to temperatures close to absolute zero they turn into a gas, known as a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), pictured. For the first time, researchers have simulated how matter behaves when photographed at these temperatures and developed a way to keep it cool, making it possible to study the gas for longer

Extremley-cold Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) represents a new state of matter and is one of the cornerstones of quantum physics.

There is currently a great deal off interest in the use of BEC in precision measurement.

At the moment, some of the most sensitive detectors ever made - to measure things like rotation, acceleration, and gravity - use the wavelike properties of atoms. Scientists believe BECs could further improve their accuracy . 

Another potential use is in quantum information processing. If you want to build a quantum computer, you need a way to start with matter that is in the same state, and a BEC could help achieve this.

By keeping them cold, the condensates and their atomic processes can be studied for much longer.

The process hasn’t been used in a real-world experiment yet, but the scientists from Nottingham University believe it could make studying the coldest of objects much easier.

When particles called bosons are cooled to temperatures close to absolute zero they turn into a dilute gas. This change of state is known as a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC).

Absolute zero is -273.15 Celsius (-459.67 Fahrenheit) and at this temperature atoms behave differently. For decades scientists have been studying how and why they do this. 

The boson particles change into this state because the drop in temperature reduces how much energy they have.

The researchers have simulated how feedback, provided by the magnetic coils in green, can extend how long this window can be used to peer at the quantum object

Bose-Einstein condensates have zero 
viscosity and they behave like a single ‘blob-like’ mass. By studying 
these blobs, scientists can track atomic changes and processes.

Samples
 of BECs were first manually created in labs during the mid-1990s and 
they are kept cool using a series of magnetic coils.

Traditional
 imaging techniques can’t be used to photograph BECs because the extra 
energy added by the light in these cameras causes the particles 
to heat back up again, changing the gas back into a solid and 
destroying the BEC.

More recent scientific breakthroughs involved imaging the BECs using a 
type of laser imaging called off-resonant photons. This laser bounces its
 energy off the atoms, rather than into them, to avoid heating them too 
much. 

However, this process only works for a short period of time before too much energy is used and the BECs heat up again. 

Michael Hush from the University of Nottingham, with researchers from 
Australia, have developed a computer program that simulates this 
off-resonant imaging, as well as the behaviour of the Bose-Einstein 
condensates to reveal exactly what happens during the process. 

They were then able to virtually filter the heating effect, and 
therefore the energy produced, into the magnetic coils used to keep the 
BECs cold to keep them cooler for longer and study the atomic processes 
for longer.

The
 results revealed exactly what happens during the process, for the first
 time ever, and the physicists could see the spread of energy and the 
change of state in action.

By studying BECs, scientists can track atomic processes. Samples of BECs were created in labs, using apparatus pictured, during the 1990s. Traditional imaging can't be used to photograph BECs because the energy added by the light causes the particles to heat up

They were then able to virtually filter the heating effect, and therefore the energy produced, into the magnetic coils used to keep the BECs cold.

Instead of heating up the particles, this method meant the energy could be used to keep them cooler for longer, letting scientists study atomic processes for longer.

The results are published in the New Journal of Physics.
