Adam Gemili, Max Whitlock and Sally Brown look frightened. The trio have competed and won medals against the best athletes in the world, in front of hundreds of thousands and, at times, even millions.

Put three easels, a handful of charcoal, a plethora of paints and a mildly eccentric artist in front of them and their combined years of training counts for very little.

‘I’m the least artistic person ever,’ sprinter Gemili makes clear at the start. ‘I feel nervous,’ adds gymnast Whitlock, who won three golds at the Commonwealth Games this year.

Brown, a Paralympic 100m and 400m sprinter, is speechless.

They do not have long to learn, as three of Sportsmail’s Road to Rio athletes meet for an afternoon art lesson.

‘The more you let go, the better it will be,’ artist Rachel Gadsden explains. She makes some broad charcoal marks on her page and briefly gives them some tips, before it is their turn.

Gadsden gets down on to her hands and knees and tells the others to draw her in the starting blocks pose, capturing her movement as she slowly rises to her feet.

They start drawing. Gadsden begins to move up slowly. ‘Energy, energy, energy,’ she barks at them.

The athletes, funded by the National Lottery, have to keep drawing shapes on top of shapes. There are confused looks from the frantically scribbling trio. After 15 minutes, they stop to reflect. ‘Take a step back and take a look,’ Gadsden says.

Whitlock steps back and flashes a huge grin to the small gathering of onlookers in the Whitechapel Gallery.

The artist goes over to his work. ‘Where are your arms?’ she asks. ‘I forgot them!’ he replies, adding: ‘I mucked that leg up.’

‘It doesn’t matter, you’re artists not athletes today,’ Gadsden says. Tissues in hand, as they’ve been instructed, the athletes work away — smudging and drawing — and finish their pieces. They are surprisingly good, but this is just the warm-up.

There is a short break and diver Chris Mears turns up, explaining he is late due to losing his car keys and wallet and having to get a train instead. He is just in time for the main event, however, and does not hesitate to dive right in.

The foursome have half an hour to capture themselves in action, using charcoal on canvas then going for it with the paint on top. Plates of gold, black, red and blue splurges are brought out. ‘Remember the paint can go outside the figure,’ Gadsden explains. ‘It increases the energy.’

The athletes are deep in concentration, with the sort of focus they reserve for when they are competing for gold. ‘You’ve got five minutes to speed up, you’re all good at that,’ Gadsden barks again. 

Then time is up. Hands are dripping with paint and dirty with charcoal. Brown wipes sweat from her brow. They have crossed the finish line, completed the complex gymnastics routine and pulled off that difficult dive. The results are strong and vibrant pieces of artwork.

All of them have finished with gold — and black and red and blue. They are covered in it.
