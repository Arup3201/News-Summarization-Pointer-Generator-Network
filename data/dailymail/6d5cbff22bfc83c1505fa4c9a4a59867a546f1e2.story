A police officer's heroic rescue of a German Shepherd injured in a car accident has gone viral after he went the extra mile to find the runaway dog.

Officer Nick Ague from South Londonderry, Pennsylvania explained that he came to the rescue because he is a 'huge animal lover' and Mya reminded him of his own German Shepherd at home.

The picture of him carrying Mya, who had injured her paws while running away from the accident, became an instant hit on Facebook.

'Huge animal lover': Office Ague was out on patrol in Pennsylvania when he heard that the dog had run away from the accident

Since the rescue on Sunday afternoon, it has 
attracted 5,400 likes and been shared over a thousand times on the South
 Londonderry Township police Facebook page.

Officer Ague had heard reports of two dogs escaping a car crash in the town of Palmyra while he was on call. The border collie had been captured, but he decided to find the distressed German Shepherd who had run away on her own.

Eventually Mr Ague and other officers tracked down Mya, but every time the patrol car drew near, she started running.

To the rescue: Mr Ague said that he was particularly keen to find Mya because he owns a German Shepherd himself

It was when Mya stopped that Ague realised there was something wrong with her.

Mr Ague said: 'Her pads were all torn up from running on the hot asphalt because of the distance the dog managed to clear from the crash.'

This was when Mr Ague went to pick up the 75-pound dog and carry her over to her owner's car.

Recovering well: Mya had sore paws from running so far but is now walking again

Owner Megan Smith wrote on Facebook that although Mya's paws are still sore, she is making a good recovery.

South Londonderry police sergeant Gerry Cassel told the local Lebanon Daily News that this is not the first time Mr Ague has gone above and beyond for animals.

He said: 'He is our animal guy. That's his thing. He's been doing things like that for years.'
