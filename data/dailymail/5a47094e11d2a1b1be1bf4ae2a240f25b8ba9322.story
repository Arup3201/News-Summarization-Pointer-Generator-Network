Caterham administrator Finbarr O'Connell is hoping to deliver a happy Christmas present to the team's 230 staff recently made redundant.

O'Connell is currently in serious negotiations with a potential buyer who not only has the financial muscle required to compete in Formula One, but more importantly also has a background in the sport.

The 54-year-old Irishman believes a deal could be completed within the next three to four weeks in the run up to Christmas, allowing just enough time for the team to be on the grid for next season.

'I am honestly talking to somebody who would like to take this over within the next month,' O'Connell said.

'This is somebody who feels the same as me, that if we don't do something quickly then the team will drift away.

'This is a credible person with credible backers, somebody linked to Formula One, and I am delighted about that.

'Talking to people with no Formula One involvement at all adds that huge risk factor, but this is somebody who knows it and who wants to do it.

'They'd like to take it over with the same people and with the same infrastructure, as the same team, and that would be the dream result for me. It would be absolutely fantastic.'

O'Connell has stated it was through Caterham being in the shop window in Abu Dhabi over the weekend that resulted in the interested party coming forward.

The Leafield-based marque went into administration last month, but via a crowdfunding project organised by O'Connell was able to hit their initial £2.35million target, actually going over by £4,334.

Caterham then put up a credible performance on track with a skeleton staff of just 40 people at the Yas Marina circuit all operating on a consultancy basis.

'The weekend advanced the talks with the buyer as they saw we are not just the concept of a team,' added O'Connell.

'They could see the people here are committed, together, that we're an operational team, and that was really attractive.'

Crucially for the buyer, there will be no trace of the two previous regimes following the fallout between the Swiss and Middle Eastern consortium who originally purchased the marque from Tony Fernandes in June, only to throw in the towel in October when a row ensued.

'A number of people have approached me over the past few weeks that they were not happy with this or that,' said O'Connell.

'One example is somebody paid for expensive paddock club tickets for one of the events and didn't receive them. Obviously we've other things on a much-bigger scale.

'So many people have come forward and been unhappy about things that have happened in the past, that they've been misled about things, and I'll be investigating that.

'But what happened with the previous owners doesn't affect a new buyer at all. The buyer buys things clean of any issues.'
