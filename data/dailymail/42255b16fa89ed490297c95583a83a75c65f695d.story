Police in Australia have charged a 36-year-old man after a passenger was attacked on board a Qantas flight from Manila to Sydney.

The victim was attempting to get some sleep on the eight-hour flight Friday night when he was repeatedly punched in the face by a stranger.

On the third strike, the victim attempted to block the punches and yelled to the crew for help, according to the Australian Federal Police (AFP).

AFP officers who were on the flight detained the assailant until the plane landed at Sydney Airport.

The air rage incident left the victim with multiple injuries, including abrasions and lacerations to his face.

He was treated by a doctor who happened to be on the same flight. 

Police said a man from Kiama, Australia, has been charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and obstructing a territory official.

He has been bailed and it scheduled to return to court in September.

Commander Michael Chew, manager aviation with AFP, warned passengers of the consequences of behaving violently on flights.

He said: ‘The AFP will not tolerate this type of behaviour. Aviation safety is a serious matter, and abusive behaviour poses a serious risk to the travelling public.’

Friday’s attack was one of two air rage incidents that police in Australia have had to deal with in recent days.

A light plane was forced to make an emergency landing earlier today when an 82-year-old passenger assaulted the 23-year-old pilot, according to police in Oberon, about 110 miles west of Sydney.

The pilot restrained the 82-year-old, who was the only passenger, and landed the plane in a paddock.

Police said the passenger was taken to hospital to be treated for head and facial injuries, while the pilot was treated for shock.
