West Ham outcast Ravel Morrison’s proposed move to Lazio hit a stumbling block on Tuesday, but he still expects to seal his move to Italy.

The 21-year-old was due to travel to Rome to sign a pre-contract with the Serie A club on Wednesday. 

But the Hammers initially blocked Morrison’s trip to the Italian capital, insisting he did not have permission to fly over and would be in breach of contract if he did.

Ravel Morrison's only Premier League appearance for West Ham this season was in August

Teams played for: West Ham, Cardiff (loan), QPR (loan), Birmingham (loan), Manchester United

Appearances: 81

Goals: 14

Honours: FA Youth Cup (2011) 

Morrison, however, expects the issue to be resolved and remains confident of joining Lazio on a free transfer ahead of next season.

The Hammers know they cannot stop Morrison, who has been dumped in the Under 21 squad by manager Sam Allardyce, from signing a Bosman deal this month with his contract expiring in the summer — but are playing hardball with the youngster. 

With personal terms agreed, Morrison was due to have a medical on Wednesday ahead of signing a three-year contract.

Newcastle are closing in on Spain Under 19s Jorge Mere and David Concha. 

Concha has already visited the club’s stadium and training facilities and was a guest during the 1-0 home defeat by Sunderland last month.

The winger, 18, who turned down an offer from Brentford, will be loaned back to Racing Santander to help them battle relegation from Spain’s second tier. Mere, 17, is a classy centre back who plays for second division club Sporting Gijon.
