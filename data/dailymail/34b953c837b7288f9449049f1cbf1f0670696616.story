Swansea may have suffered a heart-breaking set-back after blowing their lead against Manchester City but if they've let it get them down they aren't showing it.

Swansea were on track to going level with City on the Premier League ladder when Wilfried Bony scored his fifth of the season inside the opening 10 minutes at the Etihad - but Stevan Jovetic and Yaya Toure goals saw to it that the Swans went home empty handed.

Still, sitting in seventh - just one point from fourth placed Manchester United - there is a buoyant mood inside the camp at Fairwood Training Ground.

There was plenty of laughter at their headquarters on Tuesday as the team got to work in preparation for Crystal Palace's visit on Saturday.

Angel Rangel found an additional use for the foam rollers used for muscle and ITB release - a golf club - as his team-mates Jefferson Montero and Jordi Amat watched on.

The club's star re-signing Bony was also all smiles on the training pitch and in their state-of-the-art gym after putting his signature on the contract that keeps him there until summer 2018.

'I was really happy to sign a longer contract,' Bony said in a statement. 'I have a great relationship with the club. I like the feeling within the club and also the direction I believe the club is heading.  

'Signing an extended contract means I can just focus on Swansea and continue giving everything I have for this club.

'I enjoy it here – I have a good relationship with my team-mates, the coaches and our fans.'

Looking ahead to the visit of 15th-place Palace and bottom-placed QPR, Bony said his side were disappointed to lose at City but looking forward to two matches in which six points are expected.

'We played well and we could have taken a point from the game,' he told Swanseacity.net about their City defeat. 'But we must take the positives from this for the games coming up at home against Crystal Palace and Queens Park Rangers.'

City back up their Champions League clash with Bayern Munich against high-flying Southampton with second place the reward for the winner before Manuel Pellegrini's side head to Sunderland.

Swansea have a golden chance to fly up the ladder over the next fortnight, as United have tricky visits from Hull and Stoke. Meanwhile,  fifth-placed Newcastle and sixth-placed West Ham go head-to-head at Upton Park this weekend before Toon visit Burnley and the Hammers go to West Brom.
