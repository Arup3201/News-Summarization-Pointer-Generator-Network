Even big kids would struggle to outgrow the world's largest model railway.Â 

Northlandz model railroad, in Flemington, New Jersey, was painstakingly constructed by hand and took 16 years to complete.

Bruce Williams Zaccagnino started the project as a hobby in his basement with the help of his wife Jean before opening its doors to the public as a tourist attraction in 1997.

LIfe's work: It took creator Bruce Williams Zaccagnino 16 years to finally bring his dream of Northlandz - the world's biggest model railway - to life

The
 model railway has an impressive 100 trains, 400 bridges and more than nine 
miles of track, as well as 3,000 miniature buildings that make up 
idyllic miniature towns and villages.

There
 are also 50,000 streets and 40ft bridges spanning across vast 
canyons, all of which Mr Zaccagnino designed and painstakingly 
handcrafted on his own.

He said: 'There's just nothing else like it. Visitors come out saying it's one of the wonders of the world.

'I think people might be put off because they think it is just about model trains, but it is so much more than that.

Bruce Williams Zaccagnino said most of the scenes are representative of places in the world where you would see trains such as a Swiss village or big city

According to Bruce Williams Zaccagnino visitors describe the model railway as one of the wonders of the world

Historic: The model railway aims to show the history of the railroads across the U.S. through the years with famous scenes

Some people say the model railway is better than the Grand Canyon according to Mr Zaccagnino who spent 16 years building the railway

'Most
 of the scenes are representative of places in the world where you would
 see trains - such as a Swiss village or a big city.

'And
 part of it also shows the history of railroads across the U.S. through 
the years - with famous scenes including when they connected the East 
and West Coasts.

'If
 I could, I'd love to see it all for the first time. People have come in
 and told me it's better than the Grand Canyon - I wish I could 
experience that.'

The
 hit attraction was recognised by Guinness World Records as the largest 
model of its kind in the world - with competition from Miniatur 
Wunderland in Hamburg, Germany.

Attention to detail: This part of the nine mile track depicts a snowy scene with trees lining a town which the railway runs through

Wonderful: Mr Zaccagnino designed and painstakingly handcrafted the railway on his own over 16 years
