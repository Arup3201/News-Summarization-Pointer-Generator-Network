As the U.S. prepares to remember its war dead on Memorial Day, a 91-year-old who flew missions in the Second World War will be taking to the skies again over England. 

Clarence E ‘Bud’ Anderson is taking part in a historic flypast as the UK pays tribute to the bravery of US Airmen who served there in the Second World War.

Mr Anderson's return to the UK is part of the first ever display by the specially-formed Eagle Squadron of four vintage warplanes.

The display will commemorate the role of the US Army’s Eighth Air Force at a spring air show at the Imperial War Museum's Duxford aerodrome.

Eagle Squadrons were formed by American volunteers who signed up to fight alongside Royal Air Force’s pilots battling Nazi tyranny, before the U.S. entered the war after the  Pearl Harbor attack.

Representing the aircraft they flew during the war in Europe will be a rare P-51C Mustang that has been shipped to England from the U.S. to take part in the show, alongside a Hawker Hurricane, Supermarine Spitfire and Republic P-47 Thunderbolt.

The aircraft will be piloted by Dan Friedkin, Ed Shipley, Steve Hinton and Paul Bonhomme. The Americans are best known as the Bremont Horsemen Flight Team and have performed spectacular P-51 Mustang displays at Duxford before.

Mr Bonhomme is an airline pilot and Red Bull Air Race champion who has displayed historic aircraft at more than 700 air shows to date.

Mr Friedkin said: ‘It is a great honor to present the Eagle Squadron, a vivid aerial tribute to the 70th anniversary of American involvement in the Second World War.'

‘We look forward to debuting this tribute, flying in the vintage fighters which once soared over Europe, in memory of the brave aces who piloted them and the greater Anglo-American air power alliance.’

Almost half a million airmen served with what became known as the ‘Mighty Eighth’ in England and of them about 26,000 flight crews were killed, and 21,000 ended up in prisoner of war camps.

More than 3,300 fighters were destroyed as well as 6,500 B-17 and B-24 bombers being lost.

Sunday’s air show takes place on the 70th anniversary of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visiting RAF Duxford to welcome the 78th Fighter Group of the US Army Air Force to Great Britain in 1943.

The 78th was based at Duxford from where it flew P-47s on bomber escort missions, before later switching to P-51s.

Mr Anderson, who was born in California, flew the P-51 Mustang ‘Old Crow’ while stationed with the 357th Fighter Group in East Anglia during the Second World War.

The pilot notched up 16 and a quarter aerial victories and, at 91, remains an active pilot.

He is due to make a spectacular arrival on the day of the show – flying in the rear of a two-seater Mustang.

B-17 Flying Fortress ‘Sally-B’ has been gracing British skies for almost 40 years and serves as a flying memorial to the US airmen who gave their lives  during the Second World War.The four-engined aircraft is operated by a charitable trust and has survived with no official support. All its costs are met by voluntary donations, merchandise sales and an active club of supporters.The trust’s aim is to teach the public about the role of the aircraft and its crews who flew from the UK during the Second World War.Elly Sallingboe is the driving force behind the Sally-B Charitable Trust and has devoted her life to keeping the aircraft flying.She said: ‘This is a living piece of our national heritage and must be preserved for the enjoyment and education of today’s and future generations.’Built at the Lockheed-Vega production line at Burbank, California in spring 1945, Sally-B has featured in TV programs and movies, including Memphis Belle.The aircraft was brought to Britain by pilot Ted White in 1975. After he was killed in a flying accident in 1982, his partner Elly Sallingboe decided to take on the challenge of keeping it flying. She has been supported by a  team, led by chief engineer Peter Brown and Derek Smith, who is in charge of ground support.

The four Eagle Squadron fighters will 
also display alongside B-17 ‘Sally-B’, Europe’s only remaining Flying 
Fortress bomber which has served as a flying memorial for the past 38 
years.

Duxford, near Cambridge, is Britain’s best-preserved Second World War airfield and was in the front line of the Battle of Britain in Summer 1940 when missions were led by Douglas Bader, best-known for flying despite two tin legs.

It has a history dating back to the First World War and also houses the American Air Museum, which is the biggest memorial to US airmen in Europe.

During the so-called friendly invasion of America’s armed forces in wartime Britain, Duxford became known as the ‘country club’ of the European theater of operations.

Because it was a permanent RAF station, it had brick buildings and central heating.

This was in stark contrast to many of the hastily-erected airfields the 8th Air Force occupied, which featured poorly-heated temporary huts and tents.

A book by John Nicol and Tony Rennell, describes the impact of the Eighth Air Force.

Tail-End Charlies recalls: ‘[More than] 25,000 of America’s finest young men had died in the air battles over Germany. Unlike the British, their land had not been bombed; they were not under threat of invasion.

‘They had come to a strange country far from home and from their loved ones to fight an enemy who threatened freedom. They had died in that cause and they deserved to be honored by those who survived while they still could.’
