A group of whale watchers expecting just a three-hour tour were forced to spend a long night at sea after their boat became snagged by a lobster trap rope off Massachusetts.

The 157 passengers and six crew members became trapped 15 miles of the coast of Salem, near Boston, on Monday evening after one of the vessel's propellers got caught.

Divers eventually cut the Boston Harbor Cruises boat free early on Tuesday and it was undergoing a final inspection before heading back to shore for 7.30am, the Coast Guard said.

The boat had been expected to return by 4.30pm on Monday.

Night at sea: 157 passengers and six crew members became stuck overnight after this Boston Harbor Cruises boat became snagged on a lobster trap 15 miles off the coast of Salem, Massachusetts

Ken Maguire, one of the passengers on 
the boat, said about 10 minutes into the return trip on Monday, the boat stopped after apparently
 hitting something.

The Coast Guard determined that the propeller had become caught on a lobster trap, but initial attempts to cut it free were unsuccessful.

They also attempted to transfer the passengers and crew to a separate ship, but that also failed, according to Coast Guard Petty Officer MyeongHi Clegg.

Overnight, Coast Guard boats stayed near the vessel for security and passengers were provided with food, water, and blankets as temperatures dropped.

On Tuesday morning, divers hired by the vessel's owner eventually succeeded in freeing the boat, Coast Guard Petty Officer MyeongHi Clegg told The Associated Press.

'They were able to untangle the line from the propeller,' said Clegg.

Clegg said the Coast Guard was monitoring the safety of the passengers overnight and no serious medical problems were reported.

The vessel will now be escorted back to shore by two Coast Guard cutters, but will be operating under only one propeller since the other was damaged in the incident, Clegg said.

She expected the passengers would be very relieved that their ordeal was over. Whale watches are among the most popular tourist activities in the Boston area.

Maguire said passengers were told they will get refunds and other assistance.

The boat company hasn't returned a phone message seeking comment.Â
