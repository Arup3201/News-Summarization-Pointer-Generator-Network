A collection of charming images showing a lifelong friendship between a four-year-old girl and her cat have been created by a Russian photographer.

Andy Prokh, 44, from St Petersburg has taken a series of natural shots and staged photos of his daughter with the family pet.

His daughter, Katherine, is pictured with LiLu Blue Royal Lady, a grey British shorthair cat in a variety of poses.

In this image, entitled Bohemian Rhapsody Performed by Cat, Katherine is pictured holding a guitar which is too big for her

Andy Prokh said you should photograph what you love, and that he loves his daughter and his cat very much

Mr Prokh has been photographing six-year-old LiLu with his daughter, now four years old, since Katherine was born.

He said it's important for him to photograph things he cares about.

'You should shoot what you love,' Mr Prokh told the New York Daily News. 'I love these two models very much.'

'They live and grow together, I just have to do is press the shutter button on the camera,' Mr Prokh said.

The charming images of Andy Prokh's daughter Katherine and six-year-old LiLu the cat span four years

Andy Prokh is modest about the adorable images and said all he did was press the camer's shutter button

Katherine, who is now four years old, has been photographed with LiLu the Cat ever since she was born

The pair playing together have been photographed throughout Katherine's life in various different poses

'They live and grow together, I just have to do is press the shutter button on the camera,' Mr Prokh said.

The images show the pair in a variety of scenarios, including playing with apples, drinking milk at a table, pondering a mathematical equation and playing guitar.

Most of the photographs are in black and white, and feature realistic poses, while others have been edited by Mr Prokh to depict imaginary scenes.

One of the more creative images features Katherine with LiLu in a hot air balloon made out of a hat and an Angry Birds balloon.
