Dancing with Prince Charles is ‘better than sex’, Emma Thompson has claimed.

The double Oscar-winning actress, who has been friends with the prince for many years, said she had previously made a pass at him, but was rebuffed.

Speaking to Time magazine, the 54-year-old actress said:  ‘Dancing with Charles, an old friend, is better than sex.

‘There’s a long history of relationships between Princes of Wales and actors – not just actresses, not just the rude relationships as [Charles] would say, though God knows I’ve tried. He wasn’t having any of it.’ 

The prince and Camilla have dined at Miss Thompson’s home in north London.

And back in 1998, she and fellow actor Rowan Atkinson helped organise a surprise party to mark the prince’s 50th birthday.

Miss Thompson, 54, is starring with Tom Hanks in the new film Saving Mr Banks, about the making of Mary Poppins.

It also emerged yesterday that Charles has taught William how to conduct a knighthood safely using a sword.

He interrupted a family holiday in Scotland to stage a dress rehearsal of an investiture, with a sword sent up from London.

William carried out his first investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace last week.

Wearing his RAF uniform, the prince used a ceremonial sword to touch the shoulders of Sir Kenneth Gibson to knight him for his services to education.

TIME
says Charles fears that becoming king would mean he would be forced to 
drop charity work and projects he has run all his life to be replaced 
with 'joyless' duties.

In an interview at his Scottish estate in the Highlands he said: 'I’ve had this extraordinary feeling, for
years and years, ever since I can remember really, of wanting to heal 
and make things better.

'It’s my duty to worry about everybody and their lives in this country, 
to try to find a way of improving things if I possibly can.'

He
also paid tribute to the influence of his family and his 'wonderful 
wife. And of course now a grandson, which is what this is all about', he
said.

Prince Charles formed the The Prince’s Trust in 1976 to help young people on to the job ladder and explains why he set it up.

'A few people are lucky enough to know exactly what they want to 
do. But there’s a hell of a lot of others who don’t really know and may 
not be obviously academic, who suffer from low self-esteem,' he said.

He also supports PRIME – The Prince’s Initiative For Mature Enterprise - set  save the spiralling number of over-50s shattered by redundancy from the scrapheap.

His other pet issues include rural affairs, climate change, health and town planning.

The piece, released today is made up of 50 interviews with people who know Charles, and describes him as a 'mass of contradictions'.

'Engaged yet aloof, indulged and deprived, a 
radical at the pinnacle of Britain's sclerotic establishment, surrounded
by people but often profoundly alone,' editor-at-large Catherine Mayer writes.

But It is Emma Thompson who gives the most effusive praise of the future king.

'Dancing with Charles, an old friend, is better than sex.' the star says.

'There’s a long history of relationships between Princes of Wales 
and actors—not just actresses, not just the rude relationships as 
[Charles] would say, though god knows I’ve tried. He wasn’t having any 
of it.'

Meanwhile the Prince of Wales and the 
Duchess of Cornwall were given good wishes today ahead of their trip to 
India and Sri Lanka next month.

Charles and Camilla hosted a reception for members of British Indian and Sri Lankan communities at St James's Palace.

They will make a nine-day visit to India next month before moving on to Sri Lanka, where the Prince will represent the Queen at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM).

Stars attending yesterday's event included comedian Sanjeev Bhaskar, former EastEnders actress Nina Wadia, Holby City actor Hari Dhillon and film director Gurinder Chadha.

There was also a short performance by British Asian pop star Navin Kundra, who sang three numbers including Mehbooba, a big hit in the British Asian chart.

He drew appreciative laughter from the audience when he persuaded Charles to say the Hindi word to Camilla - it means 'beloved'.

The 28-year-old singer, from Coventry, said afterwards: 'It was amazing to perform here. It's been quite an experience.'
