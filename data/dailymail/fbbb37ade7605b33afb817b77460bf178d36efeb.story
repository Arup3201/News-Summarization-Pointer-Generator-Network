Last week Paul Scholes questioned the culture of golden caps and glass cabinets when England players make their 100th international appearance.

‘What does 100 caps mean?’ he asked. ‘Did you win something? No.’

Frank Lampard didn’t win anything with England - other than the player of the year awards in 2004 and 2005 - but 106 caps is an exceptional achievement.

Farewell: Frank Lampard announced his international retirement after 106 caps for England on Tuesday

On Tuesday, at the age of 36, he confirmed his international retirement, making way for another generation of England players.

It is 15 years since Lampard made his debut, against Belgium in October 1999. There were no gifts during Lampard’s international career. He earned every cap under Keegan, Sven Goran Eriksson, Steve McClaren, Fabio Capello and Roy Hodgson.

Lampard timed his run to retirement, announcing it 48 hours before Hodgson names his first England squad since the diabolical performance at the World Cup.

‘Frank has been a superb representative of the English game,’ said Hodgson. ‘It is with regret that I accept and understand the decision he’s made.’

When he was off form or out of favour with a manager, Lampard wasn’t the type to pull a hamstring or get a doctor’s note if he thought he wasn’t going to play. He turned up regardless.

‘I’m proud to get to 100 caps and to say I have done it like Bobby Moore because I grew up on stories of him,’ he revealed when he was on 99 caps last September. On Tuesday, after a final conversation with England’s head coach, Lampard confirmed he was stepping aside. He is a New York City player now, on loan at Manchester City until January, and his influence around the England camp would have been limited.

‘It has been a very tough decision. I have given it so much thought since the World Cup,’ he admitted in a statement on Tuesday.

‘Due to my club career going in a different direction it is of utmost importance for me to consider my family first and also to concentrate on how I can perform consistently to the best of my abilities over my next few years in club football.’

During the World Cup in Brazil he was a bystander, making his final England appearance, as captain against Costa Rica, when the team had already been knocked out.

With Steven Gerrard also retired, at least we will never again have to suffer the debate about whether they can play in the same midfield.

His biggest regret in an England shirt was his miss in the shoot-out against Portugal at the 2006 World Cup. ‘My dad gave me a little jolt on the phone to make sure I got my head down and got through it,’ he remembered. ‘You have ups and downs in your England career, but you don’t get to 100 caps unless you get through these moments.’

The following season, back in the a Chelsea shirt, he was taunted by opposition supporters singing: ‘You let your country down’. The reality is that he never did.

He worked too hard, motivated throughout his career by the words of a former West Ham team-mate when he was doing extra sets of ‘doggies’ after training.

‘What the **** are you doing?’ shouted Martyn Mullen, getting a laugh out of the young players for saying it. Where are they now?

Lampard is a proud Englishman. He wishes the famed golden generation could have won a major tournament. Perhaps David Beckham, Ashley Cole, John Terry, Gary Neville, Nicky Butt, Michael Owen, Wayne Rooney, Scholes, Gerrard and Lampard could have done more. They certainly had the talent.

Lampard said: ‘It is time to move forward and I feel confident that with Roy Hodgson in charge, the young players we have and the changes being made to the youth system, that we will have success and a team this country deserves.

‘I have always been exceptionally proud and honoured to represent my country I enjoyed every minute of wearing the England shirt.’

After wearing it for 15 years, Lampard has earned a rest.
