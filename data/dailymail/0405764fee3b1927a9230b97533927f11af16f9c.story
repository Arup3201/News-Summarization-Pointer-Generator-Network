A judge has ruled that a suspect's confession that he killed missing six-year-old Etan Patz in New York can be used at his murder trial.

Pedro Hernandez, 53, has pleaded not guilty to murdering the boy, who disappeared while walking to his school bus stop in Manhattan in 1979, in a case that mystified police for decades.

On Monday, Manhattan state Supreme Court Justice Maxwell Wiley ruled his taped confession from 2012 could be used in the case, finding that he was properly advised of his rights and capable of understanding them - although his attorney has insisted that Hernandez was mentally ill. 

It was only in 2012 that Hernandez, who had been a stock clerk at a store in Etan's neighborhood when the boy disappeared, emerged as a suspect.

Etan became one of the first missing children to be pictured on a milk carton, and the day he disappeared, May 25, became National Missing Children's Day. His body has never been found. 

After six hours of questioning, Hernandez confessed to the kidnapping on video, telling police he lured Etan to the store basement with the promise of a soda and then choked the boy.

He described putting the six-year-old, who was still alive, into a plastic bag, then putting the bag inside a box and dumping it nearby.

'I was nervous; my legs were jumping,' Hernandez said. 'I wanted to let go, but I just couldn't let go. I felt like something just took over me. I don't know what to say. Something just took over me, and I was just choking him.'

On the video, Hernandez is dressed in a brown jacket, white T-shirt and jeans, and sits at an empty desk save for a can of Pepsi.

He talks about his family and his medical history - he is HIV-positive, suffers back problems and is bipolar.

He explains how he killed the child but doesn't remember what the boy was wearing, that Etan had a cap on when he vanished, or that the weather was bad that day. 

He says he tossed the boy's book bag behind a freezer; no bag was ever found. He does not remember the boy saying anything, and nothing in particular caught his attention that made him choose the boy, he says.

'I just approached to him or I asked him, you want a soda? I said come with me,' he said. 'He didn't say nothing to me. He didn't kick. He wasn't angry. He just kind of stood there, and I just felt bad what I did.'

Hernandez's lawyer, Harvey Fishbein, argued his client falsely confessed and lacks the mental ability to understand his rights. 

He described Hernandez's demeanor on camera as exhausted from hours of questioning; Hernandez had been in custody nearly eight hours when the taping began.

'When those eight hours were finished, he was convinced he had something to do with the disappearance of Etan Patz,' Fishbein said.

Unanswered questions: Etan's parents Stan (left) and Julie Patz. Both were in court the day the confession was heard in September, but Julie left the courtroom before the tape with played

The Manhattan district attorney's office says the confession was real and legally obtained.

In 2012, police got a lead that brought them to Hernandez, a high school dropout who had worked at a corner store near where Etan disappeared.

Hernandez, most recently a resident of Maple Shade, New Jersey, also told police that he confessed before: to his ex-wife, to a friend, and in front of about 15 people during a prayer circle at a church group. 

In the 1980s, Hernandez allegedly told the group that he had harmed a child in New York.

'We were all holding hands and praying,' he said of the church meeting. 'And everybody was confessing, so I confessed. I told them I killed a child.'

But no one ever went to authorities and investigators have not pointed to any physical or scientific evidence against Hernandez.

At about 70, Hernandez's IQ puts him in the bottom 2 per cent of the population, a defense psychological expert testified during a weeks-long hearing this fall.

His lawyer has said Hernandez's medical records mention schizophrenia dating back years, he has taken anti-psychotic medication for years, and since his arrest, he has been diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder. 

Its effects on him include 'cognitive and perceptual distortions,' including hallucinations, Fishbein has said. In one of the confessions, Hernandez says he has had visions of his dead mother.

A defense psychologist told the court he believed Hernandez would not have fully comprehended what he was agreeing to in saying he understood his Miranda rights.

But a prosecution expert differed, noting that Hernandez scored not much below people of average intelligence on a specific test of how well someone understands the function of the familiar Miranda rights warning during police interrogation.

'The evidence convincingly demonstrated that he knowingly waived those rights and voluntarily provided a statement,' Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon later wrote in a court filing.

Hernandez had gone through 11th grade without special education or remedial summer school, represented himself in a prolonged divorce and child support proceeding, participated in his church, and successfully applied for Social Security disability benefits, the prosecutor noted.

Etan's parents have not commented.

A judge had to decide not whether the confession was true, but whether it could be permitted to be used as evidence at Hernandez's murder trial
