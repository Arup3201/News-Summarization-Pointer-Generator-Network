Paul Scholes showed that he hasn't lost any of his midfield magic, scoring a wonderful goal in a legends match in Thailand this week.

Scholes, who retired in 2013, demonstrated his enduring class with a delightful chip from just outside the box, over the head of Arsenal's 'Invincible' goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.

The former England star later bagged a second, arriving in the box to smash past Lehmann in an 8-5 victory for 'Team Cannavaro'.

However, the United legend was upstaged by former Spain and Real Madrid full back Michel Salgado, who scored the goal of the night.

Bombing forward from right back, Salgado arrived un-marked in the box, controlled the ball with his chest, before firing a bicycle kick past Liverpool's hero of Istanbul Jerzy Dudek.
