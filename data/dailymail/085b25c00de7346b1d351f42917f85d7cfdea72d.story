Herman Cain brushed off sexual harassment claims brought against him in the 1990s that he says were later dropped as 'baseless,' as he said of one of the women: 'I don't even remember her name.'

The 2012 presidential hopeful today revealed why one of two female employees accused him of sexual harassment while he was head of the National Restaurant Association in the 1990s.

However, Cain came under fire for changing his story, stating in an interview with Fox News that a settlement was paid to one of the accusers.

But in an earlier interview, the former Godfather's Pizza CEO said he knew of no such settlement.

Denial: Herman Cain says he 'never sexually harassed anyone' while he was at the National Restaurant association

Meanwhile, he has labelled 
allegations of sexually suggestive behaviour revealed in a Politico 
report that threatens to trip up his run for Republican presidential candidate as 'false accusations'.

The report alleged the women signed agreements with the group that gave them five-figure financial payouts to leave - but it allegedly barred them from discussing this. Neither woman was identified.

'I've never sexually harassed anyone and
 I was falsely accused while I was at the National Restaurant 
Association,' GOP presidential candidate Mr Cain told Fox News' Greta Van Susteren yesterday.

'If the Restaurant Association did a settlement I wasn't even aware of it and I hope it wasn't for much because nothing happened.'

'She was in my office one day, and I made a gesture saying - and I was standing close to her - and I made a gesture saying you are the same height as my wife'- Herman Cain

Mr Cain told Fox News that
he remembered one incident where a female worker in her late 30s or early 40s
was upset with a gesture he made.

‘She was in my office one day, and I made a gesture saying -
and I was standing close to her - and I made a gesture saying you are the same
height as my wife,’ he told Van Susteren.

‘And I brought my hand up to my chin saying: “My wife comes
up to my chin”. And that was put in (the complaint) as something that
made her uncomfortable,' he said - reported the Washington Examiner.

Mr Cain said that he recused himself as CEO of the National Restaurant Association after the first claim was filed, a claim which was later found to be 'baseless,' he said.

He added: 'I have no idea who’s egging this on, who's on this witch hunt, but I am convinced - and my staff and I are is convinced - it's intended to distract us.'

The report was based on anonymous 
sources and what it said in one case was a review of documents describing the allegations and the resolution.

'Liberals are terrified of Herman Cain. 
He is a strong conservative black man... they are terrified of strong, 
conservative, black men'

- Ann Coulter

Republican commentator Ann Coulter told Fox News: 'Liberals are terrified of Herman Cain. He is a strong conservative black man... they are terrified of strong, conservative, black men.'

But Politico's Jonathan Martin, who co-wrote the story, said the allegations include 'verbal and physical gestures'.

'In one case it involved, I think, inviting a woman up to a hotel room of Cain's on the road,' Mr Martin told MSNBC.

Backing: Republican commentators Ann Coulter, left, and Rush Limbaugh, right, have criticised the report. Ms Coulter said: 'Liberals are terrified of Herman Cain. He is a strong conservative black man'

But Mr Cain said he has never travelled with either of the accusers.

In addition, his campaign said the allegations were not true and were an unfair attack.

'(It's) an unconscionable, racially 
stereotypical attack on an independent, self-reliant conservative black -
 because for him that behavior is not allowed'

Rush Limbaugh

'Inside-the-Beltway media have begun to launch unsubstantiated personal attacks on Cain,' his spokesman JD Gordon said.

'Dredging up thinly sourced 
allegations stemming from Mr Cain's tenure as the Chief Executive 
Officer at the National Restaurant Association in the 1990s, political 
trade press are now casting aspersions on his character and spreading 
rumours that never stood up to the facts.'

Republican commentator Rush Limbaugh said on his talk show the report was 'an unconscionable, racially stereotypical attack on an independent, self-reliant conservative black - because for him that behavior is not allowed'.

Outsider: Cain has launched an unconventional campaign that last week saw him campaign in Alabama, which will not vote until way into next year

Mr Cain - a self-styled outsider 
relatively new to the national stage - is facing a new level of scrutiny
 after a burst of momentum in the GOP race.

He's been steadily at or near the top 
of national surveys and state polls, 
competitive with former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney.

'The
 story has been floating around for a long time, but (I) don’t know any 
of the details,' Republican consultant Sal Russo told the Washington 
Post.

'I have heard it both ways about whether it was anything egregious. So (we) have to wait and see.'

The results of a poll by Iowa's respected Des Moines Register newspaper underline extreme shifts among Republican base voters. 

They gave Representative Michele Bachmann, an ultraconservative congresswoman from neighboring Minnesota, a victory in the Iowa straw poll in August - but quickly deserted her, leaving her to sink to the second tier of candidates.

That happened after Texas Governor Rick Perry entered the race, shot to the top, then watched his support collapse after weak debate performances.

Now it's businessman Mr Cain's turn at the top.

Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts and a venture capitalist who lost the nomination in 2008 to Senator John McCain, has been holding steady in the polls at about 20 to 25 per cent support. 

Saturday evening's poll results showed Cain at the head of the pack, with the support of 23 per cent of respondents.

Mr Romney came in just behind him at 22 percent.

Texas Representative Ron Paul, a libertarian-leaning Republican, placed third at 12 per cent, followed by Mrs Bachmann at 8 per cent.

Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer told the Washington Post ex-president Bill Clinton's campaign 'survived this and much worse'.

But Concerned Women for America president Penny Nance said: 'I think Herman Cain needs to directly answer the question.

'Early in my career I resigned from a trade association for the exact same reason and with no financial settlement,' she told Politico. 'I simply found another job.'

The former pizza company executive has
 been pointing to his long record in business to argue that he has the 
credentials needed to be president during a time of economic strife.

In its report, Politico said it 
confronted Mr Cain early on Sunday outside of the CBS News Washington 
bureau, where he had just been interviewed on 'Face the Nation.'

'I am not going to comment on that,' he told Politico when asked about one of the woman's claims.

When asked if he had ever been accused
 of harassment by a woman, Politico said he responded by asking the 
reporter, 'Have you ever been accused of sexual harassment?'

He had previously predicted that he would face character assassination throughout his campaign.

'They're going to come after me more viciously than they would a white candidate,' Mr Cain told the Washington Examiner in May.

'To use (black Supreme Court justice) 
Clarence Thomas as an example, I'm ready for the same high-tech lynching
 that he went through - for the good of this country.'

A message seeking comment from Peter 
Kilgore, the National Restaurant Association's 
chief legal counsel, was not immediately returned.

'I have never sexually harassed anyone, let's say that. Secondly, I've never sexually harassed anyone, and yes, I was falsely accused while I was at the National Restaurant Association - and I say falsely, because it turned out, after the investigation, to be baseless. The people mentioned in that article were the ones who would be aware of any misdoings, and they have attested to my integrity and my character. It is totally baseless, and totally false, never have I committed any sort of sexual harassment.'
