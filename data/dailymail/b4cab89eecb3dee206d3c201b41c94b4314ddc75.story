Football spectators have been spooked by a ghostly figure that appears to run through fans during a match in Bolivia.

The unexplained shadow glides quickly through the stands during a game in Hernando Siles Stadium in La Paz, Bolivia, on Thursday night.

It even appears to run straight through a barrier at speed.Â

The figure appears to run at speed through fans and even a barrier during the match

The video, shot during a television broadcast of the match, has gone viral with internet sleuths sharing their theories on the apparition.

This is not the first time an unexplained apparition has been spotted at a South American stadium.

Some Venezuelans believe the 'ghost' of their deceased President Hugo Chaves was responsible for saving an otherwise certain goal during an international match against Colombia.

A figure can be seen tapping the ball over the goal post.
