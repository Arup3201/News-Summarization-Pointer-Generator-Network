Mr Justice Mostyn said the case was 'terrible' and the most 'chilling' in his 30-year career

A baby girl was beaten and shaken to the point of death in a series of ‘macabre and chilling’ attacks by her father, a High Court judge has ruled.

The 20-year-old man subjected his daughter to ‘diabolical’ assaults which broke ‘the most basic and elemental taboos which govern our society,’ Mr Justice Mostyn found.

In a judgement made public today he said the four-month-old child was saved after she collapsed and was taken to hospital. She was found to have a broken neck and severe damage to her spine.

Doctors who examined her also discovered that she had five broken ribs, inflicted over a three-month period, and as many as five fractures to both legs, suffered between mid-December last year and early January this year. There were numerous more minor wounds, grazes and bruises .

The father – who has been jailed for 12 years - admitted in a statement to the High Court: ‘I am a monster.’

However in a controversial decision by judges he has not been named, even though he is considered ‘a serious risk to the public’.

His identity will remain unknown when he is released from prison, when he will be aged in his early thirties.

Mr Justice Mostyn said in his High Court ruling, handed down in Swansea in June but only published after the end of a Crown Court trial last month: ‘This is a shocking catalogue of injuries.’

He added: ‘This is a terrible case. In 30 years as a lawyer, of which the last thirteen were as a part-time judge, and after four years sitting as a full-time judge I have never read and heard evidence so macabre and chilling as I have heard here. This is not overblown or rhetorical language on my part.

‘The father admits that almost from the time that his beautiful newly-born daughter returned from hospital at eleven days old until 13th January 2014 when she was only four months old, he systematically subjected her to a series of diabolical attacks (and I use for once the adjective advisedly), attacks of such frequency and severity that it was providential that she did not perish.

‘In his statement of 6th March 2013, the father admits everything.

‘At this point, I would only say that I doubt that even if Freud or Jung were alive today and able to advise me, that they would be able to give me an explanation for conduct that is so completely at variance with any understanding of human nature, conduct which has no basis rational or irrational, so it seems to me, but which violates the most basic and elemental taboos which govern our society.’

The judgment was published only after the conclusion of a Crown Court trial in Swansea last week in which the father was found guilty of five counts of causing grievous bodily harm. Pictured, Swansea Crown Court

Mr Justice Mostyn said the baby’s mother was ‘controlling’, ‘needy’ and ‘dictatorial’. ‘She certainly knew how to wind the father up,’ the judge said.

The mother would watch pornography to provoke the father, who took over most of the care of the baby.

The judge listed 19 kinds of assault to which the father subjected the baby while they were alone together, including pressing his thumb into her eye until it bled, throttling her, bending her double, holding her upside down and shaking her, bashing her head against a cupboard, forcing a bottle into her mouth until it bled, and submerging her in the bath so the baby had the sensation of drowning.

The High Court judge said: ‘I cannot conceive that the mother would not have been aware that something was amiss while these barbaric attacks were being carried out.’

Mr Justice Mostyn’s family division ruling found that ‘exceptionally serious crimes have been committed by the father’ and that the girl’s 19-year-old mother ‘is guilty of neglect’.

At the time of the ruling in June the father was free and living with his step-father, and had resumed a sexual relationship with the mother.

Mr Justice Mostyn called on the Crown Prosecution Service ‘to make their decision about whether to prosecute at the soonest opportunity so that all aspects of this desperately tragic case can be concluded as soon as possible.’

The June judgment was published only after the conclusion of a Crown Court trial in Swansea last week in which the father was found guilty of five counts of causing grievous bodily harm. The jury took just 90 minutes to bring in its verdict.

The 20-year-old was sentenced to 17 years, with 12 years to be served in prison before release on licence for five years.

The Crown Court judge, Judge Keith Thomas told the father: ‘You do present a serious risk to the public. In order to do what I can to protect the public, I am going to maximise that term.’

But Judge Thomas ordered that the name of the man should remain secret. The judge is understood to have been concerned that nothing should allow the public to identify the child, who is now in local council care.

The unusual decision means that naming the father has been banned by both Judge Keith Thomas in the Crown Court and Mr Justice Mostyn in the High Court.

Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming, a campaigner against secrecy in the courts, said: ‘The evidence from the Rotherham scandal is that secrecy does not necessarily protect children. It should not be imagined that failing to name an offender is doing the right thing

‘In this case, the wider public has been left at risk. It is doubtful that failing to name the monster will protect the child, but it certainly puts the rest of society at risk. So often secrecy has not protected the child – it has protected the abusers.’

During the Crown Court trial in Swansea, Judge Keith Thomas made an order under section 39 of the Children & Young Persons Act, 1933, prohibiting the publication of material which might identify the victim of the offences.

These concerned the potential harm caused by being identified as the victim of a locally notorious crime.

But the judge also took account of concerns from the local authority involved that if she was identified it could harm attempts to place her with a new family as well as make it harder for her to fully integrate with any new family.

The judge made the point in court that he was not prohibiting the publication of the defendant’s name, but that if the name was reported care had to be taken not to identify the relationship between the the convicted man and the victim.
