Fernando Torres claims that if Cesc Fabregas is made to feel important at Chelsea he will take the side to the next level.

The Barcelona midfielder seems set to return to the Premier League, with the Blues closing in on his signature.

Gerard Pique was overheard on Wednesday saying that the deal was done to bring Fabregas back to England and Torres has also spoken about the midfielder.

'Big players are always good signings,' the Chelsea striker said at a promotional event for phone company Movistar.

'We know Cesc well, he knows the [English] league and he was always one of the best players at Arsenal.

'[Fabregas] likes to play good football and will offer technique, a cutting edge and also goals.

'If he's made to feel important, a leader - just as he was when at Arsenal - he can drive the team on and he's a type of player Chelsea don't have right now.'

Fabregas is close to a £27m switch to Chelsea after three years back at Barcelona, the club he left Arsenal for in 2011 after joining from them in 2003.

Torres also praised his Spain team-mate and soon-to-be Chelsea colleague Diego Costa.

The Atletico Madrid striker has passed his Chelsea medical and will soon sign for Mourinho's side too.

'He has different attributes to our other attackers, so he gives the boss a different option,' explained Torres.

'[Costa] is a strong player, good with his back to goal, and can mix it with defenders and be an outlet when you're struggling to keep the ball.'
