Questioned by police: Harley James Paynter voluntarily went to police in connection with the sickening mutilation of pug, Otis, 13

A 19-year-old man has been arrested for killing and mutilating a family's pug after police found its tongue, an eye and its intestines scattered across various locations.

Harley James Paynter turned himself into police to be questioned over the the depraved crime - which took place while he was staying at the dog owner's house as a friend of her son's.

Officers in Newark, Ohio, responded to a panicked call from the dog's owner, Melissa Lanter, who claimed she had found the tongue of her 13-year-old pug Otis - and the rest of him was missing.

She said she had seen Paynter leave her house with blood all over his face.

Newark Police Sgt. Paul Davis, who was on the scene, said: 'In 30 years, I've never had a call like this. It's gruesome.'

Police responded to the call at 1:45 am. Ms Lanter said Paynter had come downstairs around and hour earlier before leaving the house. 

In her call to the police, Ms Lanter said: 'I went upstairs and found my dog's tongue, and my dog is gone. And he had blood all over his face.

'He done something with my dog and he left.'

Paynter was being held yesterday in the Licking County jail on a charge of cruelty to animals, a second-degree misdemeanor, The Columbus Dispatch reports.
