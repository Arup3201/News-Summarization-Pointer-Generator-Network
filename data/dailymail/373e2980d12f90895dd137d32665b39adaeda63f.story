When Keely Shaw broke up with her long term boyfriend, she chalked her tiredness and headaches down to being heartbroken and exhausted.

But after collapsing on a day trip to London, she was rushed to hospital where doctors said she had suffered an unexplained seizure.

She got the train back home to Pontefract, West Yorkshire, to recuperate, but after that point, her memory goes blank.

It emerged she was suffering from autoimmune encephalitis, a rare but potentially deadly illness which begins as flu-like symptoms but causes the brain to swell.

Keely Shaw, 27, thought she was exhausted because of the heartbreak of a break-up. But she actually had autoimmune encephalitis, a rare disease which caused her to have seizures as her brain was swelling

Miss Shaw went to see a friend in London to take her mind off the break up. However she collapsed and was rushed to hospital, where doctors said she had suffered an unexplained seizure

She had suffered eight more seizures and was eventually being put into an induced coma for six weeks.

When she woke up in January 2014 she had missed Christmas, and had to begin chemotherapy treatment to stop her body attacking cells in her brain.

When she was in a coma she had also developed gangrene in her bowel as a clot had formed and stopped the blood from reaching the area.

She had been rushed for emergency surgery on December 23rd to have a foot of her bowel removed, and had a colostomy bag fitted.

But the 27-year-old is now on the road to recovery, with the help of her family and her nine-year-old daughter, Grace.

Miss Shaw recalls how quickly and unexpectedly the illness came on last year.

'I'd been with my ex for around 11 months,' she told MailOnline. 'I was upset, although knew it was for the best when it ended.

''But the break up had taken it out of me and I'd been exhausted.

'I just felt a bit ill. I'd felt run down and suffered headaches.'

So she organised a trip to London in November 2013 to perk her up and keep her mind off the break-up.

'I was planning to see my friend Craig,' she said. 'Grace was staying with my parents.

'He picked me up from the station and we went to his house. He popped opened a bottle of champagne, started to pour it. 

Doctors put Miss Shaw into an induced coma for six weeks while they treated her for autoimmune encephalitis. During this time, her bowel became gangrenous due to a blood clot and she had part of it removed. She is pictured after waking up from the coma, and soon had a colostomy bag fitted

Although the initial shock passed, for a number of weeks she was still too frail to see her daughter Grace, who stayed with her parents. She says the moment she saw her daughter again was 'brilliant'

Autoimmune encephalitis is a serious medical condition in which the immune system attacks the brain, impairing function.

It caused by a problem with the immune system (the body's natural defence against infection).

The immune system mistakes healthy tissue in the brain as a threat and attacks it, causing the brain to become inflamed and swell.

The body produces antibodies which attack the NMDA receptors in the brain, which are proteins that cause electrical impulses.

Their functioning is necessary for judgement, perception of reality, human interaction, memory, and the control of unconscious activities such as breathing and swallowing.

It's not always clear why the immune system malfunctions in this way.

Some cases of autoimmune encephalitis are caused by the immune system reacting to the presence of a tumour (an abnormal growth) inside the body. 

The main symptoms are flu like, but people also develop memory loss, difficulty sleeping, and may become unable to communicate or speak coherently.

They might become confused, have hallucinations or exhibit strange behaviour.

Other symptoms include seizures, loss of consciousness and movement disorders.

'But I said no. And I never turned down bubbles.

'I remember I really didn't feel well.'

Hours later she collapsed and was taken by ambulance to hospital where doctors said it was an unexplained seizure.

She continued: 'Doctors told me they had done tests and couldn't find anything wrong.'

She returned to her parents' house in West Yorkshire, but that week suffered seven more seizures, ending up in hospital.

'I started behaving very aggressively and shouting at people,' she said. 'I was put in an induced coma.'

She developed a blood clot in her bowel which blocked the blood from getting to the area, leading to gangrene – where the tissue rots and dies.

While still in a coma, she had to have emergency surgery to remove the gangrenous part of the bowel, while her family stood by, hoping for the best.

She woke up confused, with a tube in her nose, having no memory of the seizures.

'I didn't remember coming home from London, I didn't remember that week, I didn't remember the seizures.

'I didn't understand why I had a tube up my nose.'

Although the initial shock passed, for a number of weeks she was still too frail to see her daughter, who stayed with her parents.

Doctors said Miss Shaw had suffered from autoimmune encephalitis, also known as anti-NDMA receptor encephalitis.

This is a serious medical condition in which the immune system attacks NDMA receptors, which are proteins that control electrical impulses in the brain.

They are necessary for judgement, perception of reality, interaction, memory and also control unconscious activities like breathing and swallowing, which is why this type of encephalitis is so serious.

Miss Shaw was treated with chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide to kill the antibodies - immune cells – that were attacking cells in her brain.

She said: 'I had chemotherapy every month to battle the infection which had caused my brain to swell.

'My hair started to thin, although I didn't lose it entirely and I was too weak to eat, was fed through a tube and lost three stone.'

Finally, she was discharged from hospital and moved back in with her parents to further aid her recovery.

'At the beginning of March – four months after I collapsed – I was discharged and went to stay with mum and dad,' she said.

'Seeing Grace again was brilliant.

'I started building up weight and went back for chemo appointments every month until June, but then doctors said I could stop, although they see me as an outpatient.

She has to take anti-seizure and steroid medication to stop the swelling in her brain, which she says make her 'tired and emotional' and prone to be completely knocked out by illnesses like a cold.

Miss Shaw is now on the road to recovery thanks to the help of her family and daughter Grace. Though the medication she now takes leaves her 'tired and emotional', she hopes to go back to work as a financial advisor once her colostomy bag is removed

'My neurologist has said in three years I could be medication-free,' she said, 'so fingers crossed.'

Adjusting to life with a colostomy bag has also been difficult, leaving her tired and in pain.

'It can get you down, it's really painful and it can stop you doing lots of things.

'There are people who have got them for life and they just get on with it.'

'But I'm lucky mine is reversible – it gives me hope that it will be removed soon.'

In a few months she will have a procedure sin which they will remove the colostomy bag and stitch up her bowel so it can function normally.

Once the bag is removed, she hopes to go back to work as a financial advisor.

'It's horrible not working, because I've worked since I was 16,' she said.

'It's what I've always done. Moving back in with my mum and dad, that was a big change too.'

'They are so brilliant, I can't complain.'

She is also proud at how well her daughter has coped with the terrifying ordeal of her mother being hospitalised and in a coma.

She said: 'She seems to just get on with it. If I'm unwell she makes me a get well card, if I'm tired she just leaves me to it.

'She took my story in a magazine to show her friends at school, she's dead proud of me.'
