The head of Britain's largest teaching union NASUWT, Chris Keates, said that the cameras were stripping teachers of professionalism

Teachers are being treated like ‘lab rats’ and subjected to Big Brother-style surveillance during lessons, it has been claimed.

Schools are using CCTV cameras in classrooms to ‘spy’ on staff and monitor their performance as well as check the times they arrive and leave.

Some members of staff are being punished for moving chairs and interrupting colleagues’ lessons after headteachers have reviewed footage.

This 
‘excessive monitoring’ comes as rising numbers of state schools across 
the country are installing cameras as a safety measure.

In 
December, principal Neil Houchen came under fire after deciding to 
install CCTV cameras in the boys' and girls’ toilets at The Eastwood 
Academy, Leigh-on-Sea, Essex.

The
 move formed part of a security crackdown on vandals and bullies, but 
parents claimed it was a ‘disgusting’ invasion of privacy.

More
 than 200 schools across Britain are using CCTV cameras in pupils' 
toilets or changing rooms, according to a Big Brother Watch report two 
years ago.

Chris
 Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, warned that teachers are also 
being ‘undermined and stripped of their professionalism’.

She
 said: ‘Now in some schools, they are being subjected to permanent 
surveillance through CCTV cameras. Lab rats have more professional 
privacy.’

Around 7,500 members responded to the 
union’s CCTV survey. Nearly one in ten teachers (eight per cent) 
reported cameras in their classrooms.

Of these, 89 per cent said they could not switch off the CCTV and 88 per cent said that it was constantly recording their lessons.

Over half (55 per cent) said headteachers viewed the footage and 41 per cent claimed it was being used to ‘find evidence to form negative views about staff’.

While teachers acknowledged that CCTV could ‘enhance pupil and staff safety’, a third believed it was an invasion of their professional privacy.

A third of teachers believed that the cameras were an invasion of their privacy. Teachers are also unable to turn off the cameras in 89 per cent of cases

Some schools are using CCTV to monitor Newly Qualified Teachers (NQTs) who are believed to be under-performing.

One teacher surveyed said they were disciplined for visiting another colleague’s classroom – a five minute disruption that had been recorded on tape.

‘This tape was played back at least ten times by the headteacher and a note of the incident has been put on my file for a year,’ he said.

Another spotted senior staff members reviewing CCTV footage in the school office.

The teacher said:  ‘When I asked what my head of department was doing watching a colleague in this way she said she was trying to catch him out.’

A member of staff claimed that CCTV had been used against teachers ‘to imply they are handling a situation incorrectly even though the CCTV has no sound’.

It was also used to ‘scare’ staff and to punish them, for example when chairs were moved from one ‘zone’ to another, he added.

A teacher said: ‘In my last school it was routinely used to see what time teachers were in class and what they were doing. It was also used to monitor leaving times.’

One teacher said they received an email from their deputy head during a maths lessons ‘asking me to inform pupils that he was watching them on CCTV’.

However, a member of staff claimed that their senior management team had ‘erased CCTV when they have been caught on camera being unprofessional’.

Ms Keates said: ‘In some cases, teachers reported having their private conversations filmed when the school was not in session.

‘The stories teachers recounted to us in the survey are a shocking catalogue of professional disrespect and unacceptable intrusion.

‘No other professionals are subjected to such appalling treatment. No one should be subjected to the stress and pressure of being watched constantly.

‘The NASUWT will support members in resisting such practices in schools where such abuse is taking place through all appropriate means, including industrial action.’

Members of the NASUWT will debate a motion condemning the excessive monitoring of teachers at their annual conference in Birmingham today.

Last July, a report from the British Security Industry Authority (BSIA) estimated there are between 291,000 and 373,000 cameras in state schools, plus a further 30,000 to 50,000 in independent schools.
