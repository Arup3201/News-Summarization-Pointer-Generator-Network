Drugs paraphernalia will be given to heroin addicts for free by the government in a bid to deter them from injecting the substance.

Users will be given free foil to help them heat up the class-A drug in an attempt to encourage them to inhale it and thereby avoid the risks of contracting diseases such as HIV.

Aluminium foil is used to warm heroin and breathe in its fumes to get high.

Under current laws health professionals are banned from giving out foil to addicts, but the new rules, thought up by the Home Office, would end this practice.

The scheme is likely to draw criticism from anti-drugs campaigners for fear it could encourage people to take drugs.

Crime Prevention Minister Norman Baker said: ‘By allowing foil to be legally provided by healthcare professionals we are taking another positive step in reducing the number of individuals, families and communities whose lives are destroyed by drugs.

‘The decision was made on the condition that it is part of structured efforts to get individuals off drugs and will minimise the risk of spreading viruses like HIV, while encouraging more addicts to engage with support services.

‘It is also part of a range of work the coalition government is doing to reduce and prevent illegal drug use - helping dependent individuals through treatment, educating young people about the risks and supporting law enforcement in tackling the illicit trade.’

Professor Les Iversen, former chairman of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, first made calls in 2010 for foil to be given to addicts to deter them from injecting.

Schemes which give drug users safe places to inject and dispose of needles cleanly are already run in areas with high heroin usage.

The scheme would cost £72 per addict per year, as opposed to the £84 per addict per year currently spent on providing clean needles.

It comes as recent figures suggest nearly 300,000 people in the UK still use heroin and crack cocaine.
