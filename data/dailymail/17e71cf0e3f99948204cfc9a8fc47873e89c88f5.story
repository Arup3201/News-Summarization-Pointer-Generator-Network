Grasping her mother’s hand tightly as she waited to go into yet another hospital appointment, it dawned on opera star Camilla Kerslake how alien the situation felt.

Of course, the clinical white walls and smell of disinfectant were unfamiliar but it was the role she was playing that suddenly struck her as so very odd.

‘My mum has always been my rock, the first person I could turn to when I felt wobbly or vulnerable,’ says Camilla, 24. ‘Now I was the one reassuring and providing support, while at the same time being quite terrified myself.’

Camilla’s feelings were entirely justified because this wasn’t a routine check-up. It was one of innumerable visits her mother had to make to the Royal Marsden Hospital, West London, to monitor the cancer in her right breast.

Supporting act: Camilla Kerslake helped her mother Deborah through breast cancer

Deborah, 51, a psychotherapist, was 
diagnosed in June last year. It has been a difficult time but Camilla, 
her partner – England rugby player Chris Robshaw – and her family 
believe they have come out of the ordeal closer and stronger.

When
Deborah was first given the devastating news, Camilla’s diary was 
crammed with tours, dates and public events. She had just completed a 
whirlwind 18 months in which she’d been nominated for a classical Brit, 
sang for the Queen, had a bestselling debut album and performed at 
Twickenham and Wembley in front of thousands.

Forthcoming appearances were due to earn her more than £250,000, fulfilling her dream of becoming a major music star.

‘It
was a simple choice – I just dropped everything,’ says Camilla. ‘My 
agent said I was mad. We were supposed to be finalising a date I’d been 
asked to do, performing at the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia’s wedding, 
and there was an insane amount of money at stake.

‘But
my priority was Mum. I want to be successful, but what is fame and 
money if you don’t have the people you love most in the world?’

Singing for strength: Before her mother's diagnosis, Camilla, seen singing at Twickenham Stadium, was set to make a quarter of a million pounds in planned performances, but she gave it all up

Indeed Camilla, who shot to fame three years ago after being discovered by Take That’s Gary Barlow, and her mother are incredibly close. The singer, who suffered with severe stage fright, credits Deborah for getting her into the spotlight at the beginning of her career after giving her hypnosis.

‘People ask me if I am proud of my daughter because of what she has achieved in the music business but what makes me really proud is what a lovely girl she is,’ says Deborah.

‘All she has ever wanted is a singing career and she was happy to throw it all away for me. I told her not to, her father told her not to but she refused to listen.’

The mother and daughter are speaking just before Camilla performs in front of a small, exclusive audience at The Grosvenor House Apartments by Jumeirah Living overlooking London’s Hyde Park.

It is the second time she has performed here – she turned on their Christmas lights earlier this month – and both times, all money raised has gone to breast cancer charities.

Looking back at the diagnosis, Camilla could see that her mother’s health had deteriorated but did not think it was anything serious.

‘She had felt tired for the past year, but being fully immersed in her career we all thought she just needed a holiday. There was no history of breast cancer in the family – she hadn’t developed any lumps – so it never occurred to any of us, least of all her.’

Team work: Camilla says the support from her partner, England and Harlequins rugby captain Chris Robshaw helped her through the tough times

Deborah, 51, a psychotherapist, was 
diagnosed in June last year. It has been a difficult time but Camilla, 
her partner – England rugby player Chris Robshaw – and her family 
believe they have come out of the ordeal closer and stronger.

When
Deborah was first given the devastating news, Camilla’s diary was 
crammed with tours, dates and public events. She had just completed a 
whirlwind 18 months in which she’d been nominated for a classical Brit, 
sang for the Queen, had a bestselling debut album and performed at 
Twickenham and Wembley in front of thousands.

Forthcoming appearances were due to earn her more than £250,000, fulfilling her dream of becoming a major music star.

‘It
was a simple choice – I just dropped everything,’ says Camilla. ‘My 
agent said I was mad. We were supposed to be finalising a date I’d been 
asked to do, performing at the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia’s wedding, 
and there was an insane amount of money at stake.

‘But
my priority was Mum. I want to be successful, but what is fame and 
money if you don’t have the people you love most in the world?’

‘I had to help in any way I could. It’s not just about going to the doctor’s, it’s about being there, helping, lifting spirits. There are just three of us in my family and we’ve helped each other through tough times.

‘Being so ill meant Mum couldn’t work. My dad works in IT and it was really important that he kept his job. Then there was me. My job is singing. I do what I do because my parents have always supported me. I just felt this was going to be the most important thing I could do.’

Perhaps one unexpected positive to have come out of the dreadful experience, says Camilla, is that it brought her closer to Chris, 26. ‘Family is hugely important to him – he lost his dad to a heart attack when he was five and he is extremely close to his mum. I’d spend every day with my mum and then when Dad returned from work I’d go home to Chris. He picked me up off the floor so many times.’

In October 2011, Deborah had a full mastectomy and reconstruction of the right breast. It took nine hours to remove and rebuild the area using tissue taken from her stomach.

‘That was awful,’ says Camilla. ‘Before that, I think everything had seemed unreal. But suddenly, it was really happening.

‘Dad and I waved goodbye to Mum as she was wheeled through the doors into theatre. As they swung shut, I broke down. I thought that might be it. I can’t think of that moment now without crying.’

The operation was successful, although there were minor complications with the reconstruction that required a follow-up procedure this February. And because the cancer had not spread to the lymph nodes, Deborah did not require additional therapy to treat the condition.

‘Last Christmas was difficult because,
although it was confirmed that the cancer was contained and that she 
would not require chemotherapy, Mum was still in an awful lot of pain,’ 
says Camilla. ‘She just didn’t look like her usual strong self.’

But
12 months on, there is now every reason to celebrate what the New Year 
has to offer. Deborah was given the all-clear in July and now feels 
almost entirely back to her normal self.

‘I
was incredibly lucky that my cancer treatment and recovery have been 
relatively straightforward,’ she says. ‘I have discovered a strength I 
never knew I had and I haven’t had to deal with the trauma of losing a 
breast because the day that I lost one, I regained one – it even has a 
nipple! I think that was a real psychological help.’

Mentor: Camilla was discovered by Gary Barlow in 2009 at the age of 21

Nodding her head, Camilla agrees: ‘I look at Mum now and see how much better she is. I appreciate how much more wonderful and beautiful she is than before. This past year has changed me as a person. I feel about ten years older.’

Camilla has other reasons to be excited about the year ahead. She has signed a deal for a third album and there has been renewed interest in her career since singing with Andrea Bocelli last month.

‘I hadn’t done any big concerts for a while but I received a last-minute call asking if I could sing with Andrea. The girl he was due to perform with had fallen ill and they needed a replacement. This time I asked Mum to help me and she rushed across town with a ballgown. Within hours I was singing with him on stage. It was all so fast, I forgot to be terrified.

‘It was a magical moment and Andrea has now invited me to support him next year. I really didn’t expect this huge interest all over again. I feel as if I have a second chance in my career.’

And while Camilla is optimistic about her prospects, she admits she does have concerns about her breasts after seeing her mother go through such an ordeal. She has made an appointment to be tested for the BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 genes, the presence of which indicates a person is at high risk of developing breast cancer.

‘I’ve decided if I do have the genes, I will do what needs to be done,’ says Camilla. ‘I will be sad because I want children and to breast-feed. But it’s about carrying on with life, not vanity, and if it happens, I know I have the best people around me.’
