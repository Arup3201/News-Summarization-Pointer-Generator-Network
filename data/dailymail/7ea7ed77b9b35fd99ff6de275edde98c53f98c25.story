Liverpool have been cleared of any financial fair play breaches by UEFA, but Hull have been fined £145,000.

The Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) announced the decisions following a meeting on Friday.

UEFA said in a statement: 'The CFCB investigatory chamber announced that Sparta Prague and Liverpool have been found (following the submission of additional financial information) to have satisfied the break-even requirement and are no longer under investigation.'

FFP rules are that clubs cannot exceed losses of £35.4million for the 2011/12 season and the following campaign.

Liverpool posted a losses of £49.8m in 2012-13 and a further £40.5m in the 10 months that preceded.

But the first set of results Liverpool posted are flexible under a term 'transitional relief' and Anfield officials have successfully stated their case to UEFA.

It is expected Liverpool will announce a small profit for last season and they expect to post an even greater profit next year, showing how much they have turned their business around. 

When Fenway Sports Group took over in October 2010, they were close to going into administration but there has been a determination to improve finances.

The club have been  aggressive in the last 12 months pursuing new commercial deals; they recently announced a global partnership with Nivea following on from deals with among others, Dunkin Donuts, Garuda Airlines and Subway.

Liverpool Chief Executive Ian Ayre said: 'During this review period, the Club was going through a transitional period having just emerged from a difficult financial and operational position under previous ownership. 

'Since FSG took over in October 2010, we have stabilised the Club and made good overall progress by taking a measured approach to our financial position as we worked towards FFP compliance. We have always been supportive of the principles of FFP and welcome today's announcement.'

Hull owner Assem Allam has agreed to pay their £145,000 fine and adhere to FFP regulations next season

Hull, who played in the qualifying rounds of the Europa League, have agreed to settle for the fine and to pay an additional £290,000 if they are not compliant with FFP for the 2015/16 season.

Last year Levski Sofia and three Turkish clubs each received a £145,000 - the same sanction that has been imposed on Hull. The CFCB is also expected to announce that investigations into Monaco, Internazionale, Sporting Lisbon and Roma are to continue.

Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain were the the biggest loser for breaching FFP regulations last season with both clubs handed £49m fines as well as restrictions on transfer spending and a reduction in Champions League squad size.
