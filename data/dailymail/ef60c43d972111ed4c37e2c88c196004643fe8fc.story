Retired vicar Brian Spence, 74, of Hook, Hampshire, was jailed for four years today after being convicted of seven counts of indecent assault on young girls

A former vicar who preyed on young girls and abused them in the church between weddings was jailed today after being convicted of a series of sex attacks.

Brian Spence, 74, was accused of putting his hands down girls' shorts, kissing them on the lips and groping their breasts when he was the vicar at St John the Baptist church in Crowthorne, Berkshire.

The four girls, aged as young as ten when the incidents took place in the 1990s, told how they were left scared to go back into the church or be alone with the married vicar.

Today he was jailed for four years at Reading Crown Court after a jury found him guilty of seven counts of indecent assault.

Judge Nicholas Wood told Spence, now of Hook, Hampshire: 'You used and abused and exploited the trust placed in you to indecently assault four girls.

'You had, in the 90s, an unhealthy sexual interest in children.'

During the trial, prosecutor Elisabeth Bussey-Jones said Spence was the 'trusted and respected' church vicar when the attacks took place between 1994 and 1998.

She said Spence attacked one of the girls in July 1995 at the church when she was 11, while another woman claimed she was assaulted by Spence at a weekend retreat designed to prepare her for communion classes.

A third girl was said to have been assaulted by Spence three times when she was 14 or 15.

The fourth woman claimed Spence put his hand on her knee under the table at a confirmation class when she was 11 or 12.

Each of the women eventually mentioned the incidents to members of their family or former boyfriends, the court heard.

When he took the stand, Spence told the jury he was 'a bit of an ostrich' who 'hoped it would all go away' when one of the alleged victims first made accusations against him via email seven years ago.

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, wrote: 'How would you like it if your wife and daughter knew the things you did to us?'

Spence told the jury he deleted the email and said he didn’t hear from the woman again until he was arrested by police last year.

Ms Bussey-Jones asked him why, adding: 
'If you received an email like that and you were an innocent man, you 
would have shared that concern with your wife and with the church 
authorities, and bottomed out that matter straight away to put it to 
bed.'

Reading Crown Court heard that Spence was sent an email in 2007 from a woman claiming he assaulted her

He replied: 'Not necessarily...I’m afraid I’m a bit of an ostrich. All I knew is I didn’t do it.

'She had made that allegation and I wondered if anything would happen from it, and nothing did until many years later.

'From my point of view, it’s not true, and I don’t know why they are saying it.'

He told the jury he would hug the children and put them on his knee 'in those days,' but denied being a paedophile.

Spence, who was more recently priest-in-charge at St Mark’s Church in Englefield, Berkshiure, before he retired, denied nine charges of indecent assault.

He was convicted of seven of them but jurors could not reach a decision on the other two, so the judge ordered that they lie on file.

He was jailed for four years and ordered to sign the sex offenders' register.
