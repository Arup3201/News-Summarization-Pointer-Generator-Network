Traffic police in the Philippines are being issued with nappies so they can remain in their posts during important events, such as Pope Francis's upcoming visit.

The measure will be used for the first time on Friday, with 2,000 nappies being issued to forces assigned to traffic duties during the Feast of the Black Nazarene.

Metropolitan Manila Development Authority chief Francis Tolentino said staff would also wear nappies during the Pope's visit from January 15-19.
