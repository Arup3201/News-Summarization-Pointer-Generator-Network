Despite the ongoing political conflict in the region, Ukraine has a thriving startup industry.

At a recent investor conference, 19 Ukrainian startups were awarded top honours across the board, and venture capital firms are investing heavily in the region.

And Yevgen Sysoyev of AVentures told Greg Satell at Forbes he believes Ukraine has the potential to unseat tech industry behemoths such as San Francisco.

During a recent investor conference, Ukrainian startups were awarded top honours across the board, and venture capital firms are investing heavily in the region. This includes Odessa-based app Looksery (pictured) that uses technology to change the user's face live on the screen, during a call, or when taking a photo

A recent study found that Silicon Valley - the name given to the San Francisco Bay Area in California - employs more than 387,000 people in tech firms.

It has the highest average tech salary, in excess of $145,000, (£92,670) and is said to contain the most millionaires in the US.

By comparison, Ukraine exports around $2 billion (£1.27 billion) in software service and development each year, a figure expected to grow by 85 per cent by 2020.

At the recent Investor Day Central and Eastern Europe (IDCEE) conference, 19 Ukrainian startups were awarded either cash or mentorships with other firms.

These included Petcube, Looksery and GoodHotels.

Petcube, is a small cube fitted with a web camera and laser that lets pet owners play with their animals remotely. 

The Petcube has a 160-degree wide-angle camera that streams 720 pixel video, a low-intensity laser pointer on a moveable platform, a microphone and speakers.

Meanwhile, Looksery, developed by Victor Shaburov and based out of Odessa, uses tracking technology to change the user's face live on the screen, whether it’s during a video call, or when taking a picture.

Microsoft Ukraine recently chose to mentor hotel booking service GoodHotels.

And Grammarly, a website that lets people paste text into a box to check its grammar, is also based out of the Ukraine.  

It has more than 4,100 firms that outsource skills to other countries, and its IT industry is growing by a quarter each year.

Petcube, is a small cube fitted with a web camera and laser that lets pet owners play with their animals remotely.

Last year, its developer Alex Neskin raised more than $250,000 (£159,770) on Kickstarter.

The Petcube has a 160-degree wide-angle camera that streams 720 pixel video, a low-intensity laser pointer on a moveable platform, a microphone and speakers.

Users can share access to their Petcube with family and friends, and even make it public so that anyone can play with their pets. 

People without a Petcube can go online and play with pets whose owners have made their Petcube public.

Meanwhile, Looksery, developed by Victor Shaburov and based out of Odessa, equally achieved Kickstarter funding in July.

The app uses tracking technology to change the user's face live on the screen, whether it’s during a video call, or when taking a picture.

It is even able to track and alter a face when there are multiple people in the shot.

And in the summer, Smart Atoms launched a campaign for a product called LaMetric.

LaMetric is a real-time smart ticker that displays notifications and other metrics, and lets users respond to them. 

The customisable ticker was designed for the home, or the office.

'We have developed our own code for video face tracking, and designed unique video filters which work in real-time,' said the team. 

'Currently we have five patents pending, involving real-time face-tracking and the technology that modifies it.'

Venture capitalist expect Ukraine's tech industry to soon be worth $5 billion (£3.1 billion)

However, many of these developers also have a presence in the US to attract and trade with other regions.  

AVenture’s Mr Sysoyev told Mr Satell, as a result of such startups, he expects Ukraine's tech industry to soon be worth about $5 billion (£3.1 billion).

He added that that ‘homegrown software firms’ that design, build and market products internationally are the sector most likely to disrupt the US dominance.

'If Sysoyev is right about the possibility of Ukrainian tech companies achieving major valuations in the near future, then Ukraine really does have a chance to break out and become a true technology hub,' explained Mr Satell. 

'Even one billion dollar Ukrainian company could attract enough capital to catalyse the entire tech sector.'
