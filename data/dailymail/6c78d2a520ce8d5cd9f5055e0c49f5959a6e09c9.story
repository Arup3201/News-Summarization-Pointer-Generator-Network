Concerns are growing today for a dolphin which has swum 50 miles inland along a tidal river.

The bottlenose dolphin - the most common breed spotted in British waters - has ventured up the Bristol Channel and into the River Severn.

It has been photographed  in the water as far inland as Stonebench and Elmore West near Gloucester.

Wrong turn: The bottlenose dolphin has been seen 50 miles inland as far as Elmore West on the River Severn 

Experts say it is likely to have followed fish upstream during high tides but there are fears it could get stuck if it ventures any further.

Alexandra Farthing, 19, who shot a video of the dolphin on Saturday night, said: 'It was definitely one of the most incredible things I have seen.

'It was an incredible site as I’ve never seen a dolphin in the wild.

'My grandparents have a slipway so I sat at the bottom of it and just watched him for hours, he came very close to the bank and I could have touched it he was that close.'

Alexandra contacted British Divers Marine Life Rescue and the RSPCA but they are not allowed to intervene because the animal is not beached and still swimming freely.

However, experts say they will become concerned if the creature swims as far as Maisemore - on the other side of Gloucester - where a porpoise once got stranded in 2009.

Stephen Marsh, operations manager for the British Divers Marine Life Rescue, said: 'When we have high tides fish might come up higher as well. 

'Dolphins follow the fish and can end up quite far along rivers.

'This is a bottlenose dolphin and they live in what’s called a fish infused society and what happens there is, individuals will move away from their family for a period, for what might be weeks, months or years, before returning.

'We do know there are bottlenose dolphins in the Bristol Channel at the moment so it may just have wandered off.

'The only concern we have is that if it went much higher, and went over Maisemore Weir it would be very difficult to get back, and there is a bore [tidal surge] next week so we hope it would be well out of the way by then.'
