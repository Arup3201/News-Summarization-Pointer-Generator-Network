Two fishermen were stunned after they caught two albino lobsters in the space of a week - despite  the rare crustacean being one in 100 million.

Bert Philbrick caught a white lobster off Owls Head, less than a week after Joe Bates caught one about a mile off the Rockland breakwater in Maine.

The unusual lobsters are extremely rare and look translucent compared with the more usual green and brown lobsters which most people are more familiar with.

The haul came as a surprise for lobsterman Bates, who has 300 traps off Rockland and has been catching lobsters since 1990.

It seems that he
 has been on a roll of late and also caught a yellow lobster on Monday, 
estimated to be one in 30 million, but that wasn’t the first time that 
that had happened.

However, when he saw the white lobster in his trap he said that he was ‘surprised and shocked.’

But despite his rare find, there was some debate about the exact breed of the lobsters.

The white shells naturally led to the conclusion that the lobsters were ultra-rare albinos.

Bob Bayer, executive director of the University of Maine’s Lobster Institute said he’s only seen a couple of albino lobsters in his lifetime.

He told The Portland Press Herald: ‘We get blues (and) we get red ones every summer. That’s not a big deal. This is if they’re actually albino.’

On closer inspection, Bayer said, it seemed at least one, if not both, have a blueish hue.

‘I don’t think they’re albinos. It looks like there’s some pigmentation there. Still, whatever they are is highly unusual, it’s nothing I’ve seen before.’

A true test of their colour would be to feed the white lobsters food high in carotenoids, like crab and periwinkles because this type of food will darken the shell, if they’re not albino.

And if they are cooked, true albinos would stay white, say experts.

Both white lobsters were under legal size and about 5 or 6 years old according to Terry Watkinson, owner of the Owls Head Lobster Co., where the fishermen brought their rare catches.

Normally, that would mean they’d have to be thrown back into the ocean to mature for two years– but seeing as they are so rare that’s probably not going to happen.

One of the white lobsters has already been snapped up by Brooks Trap Mill, a Thomaston lobster supply store.

The other will go to the Maine State Aquarium in Boothbay Harbor, adding to the spectrum of coloured lobsters already on display there.

Last month, two blue lobsters were caught in Scarborough and were taken to the Maine State aquarium.

Blue lobsters are estimated by the Lobster Institute to be one in 2 million.

Earlier this year, a lobsterman pulled a one-in-30 million calico lobster in New Hampshire. It was sent to a Hampton aquarium.

In late July, a yellow lobster ended up in a supermarket tank in Florida, where a customer bought it and sent it to an aquarium in Rye, New Hampshire.

But none compare to the ultra-rare albinos.

If any more are found, experts suggest that there could be some unusual breeding in the area.
