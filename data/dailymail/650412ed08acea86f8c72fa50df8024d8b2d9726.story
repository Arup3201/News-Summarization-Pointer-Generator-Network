Widow Betty Williams, 86, spent more than £1,000 in a selfless act to host a Christmas dinner for 50 strangers and booked a pub in east Devon so they would not spend the festive season on their own

It was a selfless act to ensure people weren't lonely as Christmas approaches, and was an act that ended up earning her worldwide fame .

Widow Betty Williams booked out every table in an east Devon pub today to treat 50 strangers to turkey and all the trimmings, as well as a glass or two of wine so they wouldn't have to eat their Christmas dinner alone.

The 86-year-old had decided to invite anyone who may have been on their own over Christmas, and spent more than £1,000 on the lunch at the Lamb and Flag pub for her and her 50 guests.

Mrs Williams was widowed 12 years ago and has found herself alone over the Christmas period in recent years due to a lack of close family and difficulty travelling. 

This year, determined not to eat by herself and moved by the growing number of food banks in Britain, she contacted  the mayor of Ottery St Mary Councillor Glyn Dobson, to organise the festive lunch.

The result was a turkey dinner for 50 guests, many of whom would have ended up spending their whole Christmas alone had it not been for the selflessness of the pensioner.

Mrs Williams said she had been looking forward to the day since she had planned it and was pleased the event had finally arrived this afternoon. 

She said: 'I don't have any close relatives at all. I was an only child, my husband was an only child, and we live miles away from other relatives.

'My nearest relatives at the moment are in Derbyshire or Kent - a long way away.' 

The pensioner said she was pleased with the turnout at the event, which saw 50 people raising their glasses to toast her for the Christmas dinner. 

She said: 'I wanted to give pleasure to some people and to get them out among friends.

'It's important people aren't alone at Christmas. It's great.'

Mrs Williams also decided to hold the lunch as her own response to the growing number of food banks in Britain, being used by people who cannot afford to feed themselves and their families. 

She added: 'I've been watching programmes on television about food banks and people by themselves being in trouble.

Mrs Williams enjoyed lunch with her 50 guests and said she hopes to hold a similar event next year 

The festive gathering meant pensioners in east Devon were able to get together to enjoy Christmas dinner 

Guests got into the Christmas spirit at the event, donning party hats and pulling crackers for Christmas

'Every time my post comes there is a request for money, and I thought rather than send the money abroad, why not help local people.

'The people who came to the lunch, I don't know them. I didn't know who would be there.

'Some of them I recognise, but that's as far as it goes. It was a pure gesture of putting money into the local economy.

'Supporting the local economy is important to me, we have all these adverts on the television for charities, most of which are going abroad, a lot of which are going to the organisers.' 

Mrs Williams, a former Italian and French secondary school teacher, originally planned to keep her identity a secret but when news of her selfless gesture emerged her identity was revealed.

She added: 'I know I am elderly, but I am not out of my mind. I am an Oxford graduate, I reason things out, and that's how I reasoned this out.

'I think the turnout is magnificent, I'm pleased to bits with it. I wanted to give pleasure to some people and to get them out among friends. It's important people aren't alone at Christmas. It's great.'

 A number of the guests at the event said they would have been eating their Christmas dinner alone this year were it not for the pensioner's kindness. Some recognised her while others had never met her before.

John Fisher, 86, a retired map maker, said: 'I have been very much looking forward to today.

'Most of my family have moved away, so it would be just me and my daughter for Christmas dinner otherwise.

'It's a wonderful gift to the people of Ottery from Betty, very generous of her indeed.

'A lot of people would be on their own for Christmas if it wasn't for Betty. Everyone has to do their bit, and its great to see Betty making a difference.'

May Kennedy, 90, a retired nursery school assistant, said she would be alone for Christmas and the lunch had given her the chance to enjoy herself with others: 'I think it is very kind and very generous, and it is much appreciated. I have lived here for the past 33 years, and have never seen this sort of generosity before. 

'I don't really know Betty. I know who she is by sight, but I don't really know her. It's very kind that she invited me.

A number of the guests expressed gratitude to Mrs Williams and said they would have been otherwise alone

'If it wasn't for this meal I would be spending all over Christmas alone. It is so kind of Betty to have invited me. 'I think it's great when people can get together, especially at this time of year.'

Win Amos, 87, a retired manager of a catering company, said: 'I had heard about it through the grapevine but had no idea we were included in the numbers.

'I think it is absolutely wonderful of Betty, she is a great person. 'I would be at home on my own for Christmas dinner if it wasn't for today. I'm so grateful to be able to share this joyous moment with members of my local community.'

After he was approached for help by Mrs Williams, Coun Dobson, 72, decided to make a bit more of the event. He organised the guests, and for the town crier and the local choir to attend.

Coun Dobson said he was really pleased with the large turnout at the event. The plan had at first been to host the festive gathering on Christmas day but everywhere was booked so they decided to book today. 

Toni Williams-Pugh, the town crier, announced the start of the festive lunch hosted by the former teacher

He said: 'It's a very kind gesture. I think its because she has been on her own.

'I have lived in the town for 50 years so I know a lot of the people who attended.

'There was criteria when we invited people, there are some couples who probably wouldn't have bothered cooking themselves a dinner, some people who are on their own. It's mostly elderly people, of course. Betty was surprised at how the whole thing went viral.

'I think it's great to help local people, and bring them together.' 

At the dinner the guests were treated to a starter, main and desert, alongside red wine which was all provided by the host.

Mrs Williams booked out the Lamb and Flag pub for the festive lunch, which gave an undisclosed discount

Pensioners and guests turned up to the Christmas dinner and said it was nice to part of the community

For starters they had the choice of winter vegetable soup or seafood cocktail.The mains were more traditional, with a choice of meats served with all the usual trimmings. For dessert the obvious choice was Christmas pudding, but there was also a poached pears option.

The diners were seated to the tune of 'Oh Come All Ye Faithful' played by the towns brass band, who continued to play throughout the meal.

Before the were served their food, the town crier welcomed them into the room, opting to use a smaller bell so that he didn't startle any of the elderly guests.

After the town crier had welcomed the guests, Betty offered a short prayer thanking everyone for attending and reminding everyone that the true meaning of Christmas is to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ.
