Two men suspected of involvement in the murder of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov have been arrested by the FSB secret service, it was announced today.

The announcement came a week after the 55-year-old foe of Vladimir Putin was gunned down on a bridge close to the Kremlin, where he was walking with his 23-year-old girlfriend, Ukrainian model Anna Duritskaya.

FSB head Alexander Bortnikov said in a televised statement: 'As a result of the work done, we have detained today two people suspected of committing this crime - those are Anzor Gubashev and Zaur Dadayev.

'We have reported it to the president.'

He stressed the Lubyanka was continuing 'necessary operative and investigative work' on the case.

Bortnikov did not immediately give details of their suspected role in the brutal killing, but TASS news agency claimed both were 'suspected of murdering Boris Nemtsov'.

Nemtsov was killed as he was preparing a report alleging the Kremlin was deeply involved in the bloody war in eastern Ukraine. Fellow opposition leaders have vowed to ensure his report is published.

The two men held by the FSB are understood to be from the Caucasus region in southern Russia.

They were evidently detained from evidence found in the getaway car, and through surveillance of telephone calls.

But the investigation is still seeking those who ordered the politician's killing. 

Earlier this week Russian President Vladimir Putin called for an end to the 'shame' of political killings which have plagued the Kremlin in recent years

The Kremlin has denied any involvement, saying that the killing was a 'provocation' designed to discredit Putin and strengthen his opponents.

He was the most prominent opposition figure to be killed in Russia during Putin's 15-year rule. 

News of the arrest comes as president Vladimir Putin earlier this week demanded an end to 'shameful' political assassinations in the wake of the shooting.

But Nemtsov's friends say the Kremlin is to blame for fomenting an atmosphere of hatred towards its opponents.

In a speech with officials from the interior ministry, Putin said: 'The most serious attention should be paid to high-profile crimes, including the ones with a political subtext.

'Russia should be devoid at last of the kind of shame and tragedies that we have recently endured and seen.

'I mean the murder, the audacious murder of Boris Nemtsov right in the centre of the capital.'

Law enforcement officials have said one lead they were exploring was that the killing was linked to Nemtsov's personal life or business dealings. 

Earlier on Wednesday, the director of Russia's Federal Security Service said that an investigation had identified several suspects, without giving details.

Thousands of Russians yesterday paid their final respects to Nemtsov when he was laid to rest in the capital.

The politician's mother Dina, 87, and four children laid him to rest, with ex-UK prime minister Sir John Major leading Western mourners attending his funeral.
