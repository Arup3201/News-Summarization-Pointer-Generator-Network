Atlanta fire rescue department chief Kelvin Cochran has been suspended for 30 days over a controversial book on Christian values, in which he claims homosexuality is a form of perversion.

The book authored by Cochran denounces same-sex relationships, at one point equating homosexuality to bestiality and calling it 'vile, vulgar and inappropriate'.

Mayor Kasim Reed's spokesperson Anne Torres said the administration did not know about 'Who Told You That You Are Naked?' until complaints were made by employees last week.

Reed's office has now suspended Cochran for one month without pay and opened an investigation to determine whether the chief discriminated against employees, WSB-TV reported.

The mayor said he was 'deeply disturbed' by the sentiments Cochran expressed in his book and said he will 'not tolerate discrimination of any kind' in his administration.

'I want to be clear that the material in Chief Cochran's book is not representative of my personal beliefs, and is inconsistent with the administration's work to make Atlanta a more welcoming city for all of her citizens - regardless of their sexual orientation, gender, race and religious beliefs,' he said in a statement.

In the 162-page book, Cochran identifies himself as Atlanta's fire chief and says his first priority in that role is to run the department 'to cultivate its culture to the glory of God'.

A copy of the book obtained by WSB-TV showed included a passage reading, 'since God made sex for procreation, he only intended it to be between a man and a woman'.

Cochran continued by  saying that those who live without God's purpose 'pursue sexual fulfillment through multiple partners, with the opposite sex, same sex and sex outside of marriage and many other vile, vulgar and inappropriate ways'.

He later defined terms such as 'uncleanness' as: 'whatever is opposite of purity; including sodomy, homosexuality, lesbianism, pederasty, bestiality, and all other forms of sexual perversion'.

'One of the most alarming things is that we did not know about the book when it was published,' Ms Torres added. 

'We understand that he was distributing the book to other employees. We are still not sure what the circumstances surrounding them are.'

The fire chief has since been ordered to undergo sensitivity training and barred from distributing copies of the book on city property, after a number of employees said they received them in the workplace.

District 6 Council member Alex Wan, who is openly gay, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that while Cochran is free to express his personal views, they should be left outside the office as they could create a hostile environment.

He said: 'First and foremost, I respect each individual's right to have their own thoughts, beliefs and opinions, but when you're a city employee, and those thoughts, beliefs and opinions are different from the city's, you have to check them at the door.'
