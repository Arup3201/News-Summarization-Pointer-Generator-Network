Ambulance trusts are being forced to recruit paramedics from abroad because of a shortage of British staff.

The London Ambulance Service has 175 Australians starting work this month in an attempt to fill staffing gaps. Nearly one in five of its frontline roles is vacant.

Six of England’s ten ambulance trusts have recruited or plan to recruit from countries including Australia, Poland and Ireland, according to figures gathered by the Health Service Journal.

In total, 183 paramedics have been brought in from overseas since April, compared with just one in the previous financial year.

Across England, an average of nearly one in ten paramedic jobs are vacant. The figure rises to one in four in the East of England, South Central and North East.

Last month the Mail reported how a staffing crisis led to 6,000 NHS nurses being recruited from abroad in the 12 months to September 2013 – a four-fold increase on the previous year.

The Australian paramedics will work 37.5 hours a week and be paid a salary of between £30,295 and £39,061.

They received relocation costs and a three-week training course on working in London, including dealing with incidents on the Underground. LAS bosses travelled to Australia and New Zealand last year, employing three quarters of the 200 graduates they interviewed. They will return there in March for another 280 interviews.

Mitchell Hand, from Sydney, said the fact London was the busiest ambulance service in the world, receiving up to 5,000 calls a day, was what attracted him.

He told BBC Radio 5 Live: ‘That’s what you look for as a graduate. You want to use your skills you’ve spent three years at university learning. It’s the unknown that attracts you here.’

Another new recruit from Sydney, Simone, told the programme: ‘I don’t have plans to go back home because the career advancement is too good.’

An LAS spokesman said it targeted Australians because ‘their skills and training closely match those in the UK’.

Staff shortages have been blamed on a lack of training places and paramedics being ‘actively recruited’ to the NHS 111 service or as disability benefits assessors.

Sarah O’Donoghue, of the union Unison, said pressure on existing staff was driving more to leave their jobs. Yesterday the Department of Health was in talks to avert a 12-hour strike by ambulance staff on Thursday.

NHS patients in Wales are suffering lengthening waits to receive treatment, an official report warns today.

Waiting time targets have not been met since September 2010 and performance has been getting worse, the Wales Audit Office found.

By contrast, the NHS in England and Scotland is performing better against tougher targets.

According to the report, one in ten patients in Wales had to wait more than 26 weeks for treatment – the target is one in 20 – and three per cent waited more than 36 weeks in March last year.

It added that the causes for the longer waits ‘boil down to the inability of NHS Wales as a whole to sustainably match the supply of healthcare with demand for services’.

A Welsh Government spokesman said: ‘We welcome the Wales Audit Office’s report, which recognises the good practice underway across Wales... [It] shows nine out of ten patients are waiting less than 26 weeks and the median wait is just under ten weeks.’
