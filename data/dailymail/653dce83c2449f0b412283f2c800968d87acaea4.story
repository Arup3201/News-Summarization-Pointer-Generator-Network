The murder rate in New York City dropped to its lowest level since records began in 2013, and now trails far behind that of America's homicide capital, Chicago.

There have been just 332 murders so far this year - a 20 per cent fall from 2012's previous low of 419 slayings and fewer than one a day, outgoing Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Ray Kelly announced this week.

There were also significantly fewer shootings recorded - 1,100 in 2013 compared to 1,367 in 2012, and overall crime was down 32 per cent for the year to December 29.

Officials put the drastic drop in murders down to an increase in police on the beat in high-crime zones under Operation Impact. They also claim to have had success focusing on teens affiliated with gangs and crews who are responsible for a third of slayings under Operation Crew Cut.

'New York's crime-fighting strategies have made us America's safest big city â€“ and one that cities across the globe want to learn from,' said Mayor Bloomberg, releasing the statistics at the graduation ceremony for the NYPD's 1,171 new officers.

'Twelve years ago, no one thought New York's crime rate could go any lower. But it did: since 2001, crime has gone down by 32 percent and in a city of 8.4 million people, there have been fewer than 350 homicides and that is largely due to the work of the fine men and women you are about to join.'

He also credited the city's controversial stop-and-frisk program for the murder rate's sharp decline, even though such encounters actually decreased by 60 per cent in 2013.

In 2012, New York recorded 419 murders, a record low at that point, which translates to 5.05 slayings per 100,000.

The Bronx has the highest rate of murders and in 2012 the borough recorded 114 murders or 8.10 per 100,000.

Chicago was America's murder capital last year, recording a total of 500 by this time, or 18.46 per 100,000. However, Chicago also recorded its lowest murder rate since the 1960s in 2013, with only 418 recorded so far.

Baltimore and Detroit were the most deadly per person, with 218 murders and 34.85 per 100,000 in the Maryland capital and 386 murders or 54.59 per 100,000 in the Michigan city.

Reliable homicide data began being kept in 1963, according to the NYPD. And homicides that year stood at 548. By the height of the crack epidemic in 1990, murders peaked at 2,245.

While murders and shootings are on the decline, some crimes are on the rise again.

Rape and robberies are down 5 per cent, but serious assault and non-violent thefts have increased 3 and 5 per cent respectively in 2013, the New York Times reports. This is largely due to the rise of smartphone theft.

Meanwhile, in New Jersey, the murder rate in Newark is at its highest level for two decades. Some 110 people were slayed in 2013 in the city - the highest number since 1990.

Mayor Luis Quintana Monday evening issued a statement saying that the city was fast-tracking the process to get more police officers on the streets and also to team up with other law enforcement agencies.

'Our entire city is mourning the loss of life due to gun violence which has negatively impacted our city during this holiday season,' Quintana said.

'We are listening to and agree with the concerns of our communities. The number one priority of my administration has been since day one, and continues to be, to address the public safety needs of our residents.'
