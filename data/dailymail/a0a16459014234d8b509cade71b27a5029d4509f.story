Being smart on duty has made generations of soldiers proud to wear their countryâ€™s uniform.

But that will be much harder for troops in Afghanistan after military bosses ordered the return of all their irons.

They have been deemed a luxury as British forces prepare to withdraw after 13 years.

Withdrawal: Soldiers at Camp Bastion, and other major bases, must give up their irons as the encampments shut down. Pictured is the British handover marking the end of combat operations in Afghanistan

The items must be given up as part of the huge operation to scale down the last two UK bases, including Camp Bastion.

Millions of pieces of equipment ranging from armoured trucks to light bulbs will come back to Britain in the biggest logistical exercise since the Second World War.

Previously, troops in Afghanistan were told to iron their  uniforms several times a week.

Some are dismayed by the shift, saying keeping soldiers smart helps discipline and morale.
