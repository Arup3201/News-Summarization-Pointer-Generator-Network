Friends on Facebook can now add photos to the same online album, the site has announced.

The move will allow groups of people to build collective albums containing wedding photos, nights out or pictures of certain groups of friends, for example, in a way that is easier to share with people and organise images of specific events.

The new feature allows up to 50 users to contribute 200 pictures each to a single album.

The rules mean up to 10,000 photos can be stored in albums where previously the limit stood at 1,000.

'Hundreds of millions of photos are uploaded onto Facebook each day and today, we’re making it even easier for friends to share photos with the roll-out of Shared Photo Albums,' the social network said.

'Whether you’re at a wedding, birthday party, or fresh off of a trip, all your friends will be able to add photos, tag photos and edit just one album.'

Users will be able to modify their settings if they want to restrict albums so just friends can view them. Those contributing to an album will be able to add and tag photos, edit the collection and add contributors

Most newborn babies make their photographic debut on social media sites within one hour of their birth, according to a survey.

Two-thirds of newborns now appear online within 60 minutes, a study by Posterista, which surveyed  2,367 parents with children under five-years-old, said.

62 per cent of parents uploaded the photos themselves, with other family members (22 per cent) and friends (16 per cent) responsible for posting the remaining images.

Facebook was the most popular outlet for displaying the images, followed by Instagram (48 per cent)and Flickr (32 per cent).

Users will be able to modify their settings if they want to restrict albums so just friends can view them.

Those contributing to an album will be able to add and tag photos, edit the collection and add contributors.

It should make it easier for people to manage which photos they are tagged in as well as not having to nag people to share certain images with friends.

Individuals involved in creating an album will be able to edit or add information to the pictures they upload, such as changing the location or date.

However, Facebook said contributors would not be able to modify photos added by the original 'owner' of the album or another contributor.

The photo album changes were brought in yesterday in the U.S. It is unclear when the new feature will arrive in Britain.
