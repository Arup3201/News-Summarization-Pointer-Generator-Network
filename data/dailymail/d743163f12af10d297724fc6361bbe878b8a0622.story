From fad diets to savvy gadgets, there are hundred of products claiming to aid weight loss.

When zero noodles were unveiled recently an army of 
health-conscious dieters were quick to snap them up - many going as far as describing the eight-calorie-per-portion food as the 'Holy Grail' of dieting.

But now, experts claim they have created a 'revolutionary' weight loss approach that is set to knock zero noodles to the back of the shelf.

New weight loss craze: Experts are claiming that Slimsticks are the latest diet craze, but are they really a healthy way to shed the pounds?

Slimsticks, a new weight loss drink, has been likened to a 'gastric band in a glass', due to the drink’s  hunger busting properties.

Experts are raving about the 40 calorie drink because of what they claim to be a 'miracle ingredient' within it.

This magic supplement, called Konjac,
is an ingredient that expands in the stomach to provide an instant 
feeling of fullness and desperate dieters are turning to Slimsticks as a last ditch attempt before enduring expensive surgery.

Konjac,
a natural ingredient derived from a plant native to Asia and palm oil 
and oat oil, supposedly provides a long lasting feeling of fullness.

Supported by numerous clinical 
studies, Konjac provides a physical reaction in the stomach making the eater 
feel full very quickly, then after 3-4 hours the palm oil and oat oil 
get to work, fooling the brain and body into thinking there’s still fat 
to digest, which prevents the hunger signals that normally see us 
reaching for snacks in between meals.

'Miracle' ingredient: The new product maintains that it's the new zero noodle because it claims to contain a 'miracle' ingredient that expands in your stomach

Available in Strawberry, Vanilla and Double Malt, each sachet has to be mixed with water and drunk three times a day before 
meals.

The sachets are sold at Boots for £24.99 and have seen a predictably huge response.

But is is this 'miracle' drink too good to be true?

Personal
trainer and nutritionist Jenny Dawes, who has worked with the likes of 
Ulrika Jonsson, said: 'This is just another high fibre "quick fix" 
product which claims to make the stomach feel full quickly.

'There
appears to be no stimulants and the side effects can cause flatulence 
and mild irregularity especially if you are not use to a high fibre 
diet.

'If the appetite is reduced and 
insufficient energy calories are cut then exercise - which is the best 
way to permanently lose weight and keep healthy - may not be performed 
due to reduced energy levels.

'Personally
rather than "sitting in the chair" drinking "quick fix" products, which
will not increase your lean body tissue muscle, why not get up and 
exercise go for a power walk, jog or run, which will lead to a healthier
body and stronger mind which will permanently keep your body and mind 
healthy without any 'smelly 'odours'. Simple!'

'People
turn to such things because they want a quick fix but its long term 
properties are unknown and unlikely to be good. Slim sticks that provide
a 'physical reaction in the stomach' are tricking our body it's long 
term health benefits will not be good.

'Slim
sticks are a craze, they will not sustain a healthy lifestyle. If you 
want to lose weight, do it gradually and with the right guidance,' added
Big brother star and personal trainer Luke Scrase.
