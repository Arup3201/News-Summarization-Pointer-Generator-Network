A German company is threatening to destroy the view in a picturesque corner of the Cotswolds by building a solar farm.

Belectric, one of the world’s biggest solar energy companies, already owns 200 large solar farms around the globe and has set its sights on Britain.

The Bavaria-based firm, which has a UK subsidiary in Iver, Buckinghamshire, already has three 30-acre farms in Cornwall and a fourth such installation in Cambridge.

It has also found plots for a further five in the South and East of England and is exploring other counties.

Its planned incursion into the Cotswolds, a symbol of England’s green and pleasant land, has outraged the community.

The 25-acre solar farm in the Gloucestershire village of Willersey would provide power to 1,500 homes. But villagers are determined to protect the vista from the nearby Broadway Tower landmark, which they say would be spoiled by the development.

A new campaign group, Save Our Cotswold Countryside, has been formed to fight the plan to scar the landscape with 66,000, 9ft-tall, shiny metal panels.

Locals fear the solar farm will deter tourists, hit property prices and damage the local economy.

Outcry: Cotswold residents are furious that they may have green fields around their villages covered in solar farms

Sarah Bent, a co-founder of the group, who has run a bed-and-breakfast near Willersey for 18 years, said: ‘Millions of people come to the Cotswolds to enjoy  the gentle hills and beautiful scenery. Now our green fields could  be obliterated.’

Ronan Lynch, who owns the land, believes a solar farm is right for the site. He tried farming but the soil is too poor to grow crops.

He declined to discuss potential profits from the deal but income from similar contracts varies from £600 to £1,000 a year per acre.

Mr Lynch said: ‘The only people who will see it are trespassers on the land or anyone who uses a footpath at the back of the site. It could power 1,500 homes and that has to be a good thing.’

Belectric is organising a meeting to address the villagers’  concerns.

Director Toddington Harper said: ‘We do not believe there will be any visual impact. I am passionate about what we’re doing but the sites have to be well screened and not on prime agricultural land.’ Councillors will make a decision on May 20.

The gold rush for solar power started in Britain two years ago when the Government offered financial incentives for firms to invest in renewable energy. According to industry regulator Ofgem, there are 589 large-scale solar farms in Britain.
