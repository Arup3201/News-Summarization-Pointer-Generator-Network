The All Blacks are used to being on the receiving end of some dubious tackles, but when they come from airline cabin crew and not the opposing team, it’s another thing altogether.

It looks like Air New Zealand off-duty cabin crew could face time in the sin-bin after some became drunk and cuddled All Black players on a flight home from the United States.

It may turn out to be a red card offence as the crew are now under investigation by Air New Zealand after Thursday’s NZ1 flight from Los Angeles, which brought the All Blacks home from their northern hemisphere tour, the Sunday Star Times reports.

In a new twist on coming in on the wrong side of the ruck, one of the off-duty crew allegedly became drunk and abused the operating cabin crew, while a second was also drunk and ‘cuddling’ a player.

News.com.au reported that Leeanne Langridge, general manager cabin crew for Air New Zealand, confirmed on Sunday that seven off-duty cabin crew were travelling back to Auckland as passengers on the flight from Los Angeles, which landed on Thursday morning.

‘There was a suggestion that some of the crew travelling back to New Zealand as passengers may have consumed too much alcohol and the matter is currently under investigation,' she said.

'Given this is an employment issue, Air New Zealand will not be commenting further.'

At least the encounter didn't go into extra time as the New Zealand team had expanded enough energy as it was on their northern hemisphere tour where they beat Wales 34-16 in the bear pit atmosphere of the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff after defeating England 24-21 and Scotland 24-16 over the previous two weekends.
