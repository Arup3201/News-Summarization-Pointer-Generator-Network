Alexis Sanchez secured a vital victory for Arsenal on Wednesday night after netting against Southampton with only two minutes remaining at the Emirates Stadium. 

The Chile international, who joined the Gunners for £30million from Barcelona in the summer, has now scored nine times in the Premier League this season. 

And late goals have become somewhat of a recurring theme at Arsenal this season with Arsene Wenger's side making a habit of fighting to the death.

Indeed the Gunners have now scored seven times in the final five minutes of their 14 Premier League matches - which is more than any other side.

It has seen the Gunners salvage six points. 

Aaron Ramsey secured a injury-time winner in their opening-day victory against Crystal Palace before Olivier Giroud headed home a late header in their following match against Everton to salvage a draw.

Danny Welbeck then spared Arsenal's blushes with a 90th-minute leveller against Hull in October.

Manchester City have managed five goals with as many minutes to spare this season. Manchester United, Liverpool, Queens Park Rangers and Tottenham are next up with three strikes in the closing stages. 

Like Arsenal, Tottenham have also saved six points in the final minutes. Without those late strikes, Mauricio Pochettino's side would be in the bottom seven.

In contrast only Aston Villa and Stoke have failed to score a goal after 85 minutes of a Premier League match this season. 

Tottenham have also salvaged six points with goals scored after 85 minutes in the league this season
