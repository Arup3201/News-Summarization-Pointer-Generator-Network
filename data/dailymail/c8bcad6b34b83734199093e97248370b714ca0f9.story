Randolph Sanders, 36, confessed to shooting his supervisor at a bus stop in Philadelphia 

A man confessed to shooting his supervisor dead at a bus stop so she couldn't report him for stealing money from the child advocacy organization where they worked.

Kim Jones, 56, suspected Randolph Sanders, 36, was stealing from Turning Points for Children, homicide Capt. James Clark said.

Fearing Jones would report him, Sanders allegedly decided to kill the mother-of-two.

He apparently knew her morning routine and followed her for more than an hour before shooting her in the back of the head at a bus stop January 13, Clark said. 

In the days after the shooting, police released surveillance video that showed the killer, dressed in black and carrying a duffel bag, walking up to Jones as she leaned against a wall waiting for the bus. 

It was hard to identify the man as he pointedly made sure he did not look at any surveillance cameras.

Investigators pieced together the killer's movements from surveillance video in the area, Clark said.

Grieving colleagues, including Sanders, at Turning Points for Children publicly spoke of the heartless killing.

'We're just stunned. Just stunned. Just stunned,' Sanders calmly told WPVI-TV just after her death.

Eventually, they managed to track the killer to a vehicle which provided a link to Sanders, a law enforcement source told Philly.com. 

Using surveillance tapes, investigators methodically traced the killer's path to and from the crime scene

Police were at unable even to see the killer's face - he made sure it could be not be seen on  security cameras

Sanders worked under Jones, as assistant director of the child advocacy organization, CEO Mike Vogel said.

Jones, the program's director, had hired Sanders as its assistant director in 2012, the sources said, and had recently come to believe he had misappropriated a significant amount of money from the program, reports Philly.com. 

Sanders of Philadelphia, confessed to investigators Sunday, Clark said. 

He was arraigned early Monday on murder and firearms charges and ordered held without bail pending a February 18 preliminary hearing.

Online court records didn't list information on his lawyer.
