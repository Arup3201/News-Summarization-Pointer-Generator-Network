A council is set to build a £12,000 'noise barrier' at a children's playground - because the sound of youngsters having fun is too loud.

Bakewell Recreation Ground in Derbyshire hit headlines last June after it was closed following a single complaint about the noise of children playing.

But after a public outcry, Derbyshire Dales County Council bowed to pressure and re-opened the facility - reinstating the original opening times.

Controversial: Bakewell Recreation Ground in Derbyshire is set to feature a two-metre high £12,000 'sound barrier' around its perimeter because the sound of children playing is too loud

They will now spend thousands of pounds erecting an accoustic sound barrier measuring two metres high and 13.5 metres long to cut the noise.

They came to the decision after sound monitoring showed the noise levels in the playground were unacceptably high over a six week period. 

Using LA90 noise measurements, the level of sound coming from the play area when it was not in operation was between 46dB (decibels) and 49dB. 

A six-week experiment at the playground in Bakewell Recreation Ground recorded noise levels of 57 decibels when children were playing. This was deemed too loud. 

Noise is measured in units called decibels (dB). The higher the number in decibels, the louder the noise. Here is a list of noises with their relevant decibel levels.

Aircraft at take-off: 180

Fireworks: 140

Snowmobile 120

Chain saw: 110

Amplified music: 110

Lawn mower: 90

Noisy office: 90

Vacuum cleaner: 80

City traffic: 80

Normal conversation: 60

Refrigerator humming: 40

Whisper: 20

Leaves rustling: 10

Calm breathing: 10

When the play area was in use however, the noise levels rose to an average of between 56dB and 57dB. 

It is estimated that the accoustic sound barrier would cut the noise by 7.1dB. 

The cost of the screen would be paid for out of the council's capital programme. 

Additionally it was recommended that a landscaped shrub border be planted to address the issue of parents allowing their children to urinate next to residents gardens - at a cost of approximately £2,500. 

The committee also agreed that further noise monitoring may be carried out on the site in the future to determine the effectiveness of the screen and whether it was necessary to install a second screen. 

At the meeting councillors were told the cost of relocating the wet play area would be around £100,000. 

At a meeting of the council's environment committee on Thursday, Councillor Peter Slack commented: 'On the site visit we could see the different issues involved in it and all these recommendations are the answer.' 

The committee passed the recommendations, which included a provision that further noise monitoring may be carried out on the site in the future to determine the effectiveness of the screen and whether it was necessary to install a second screen. 

Speaking at the time the play area was shut, Kate Hunt, of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, who went to the park with mother Jayne, son George and niece Molly, both aged four, said: 'I can't believe one person can ruin so many children's fun. 

Stunned: Kate Hunt, of Sheffield, who often visits the park with her son George, (pictured) was shocked when the playground was closed in June following a single complaint about the noise

'We've been visiting the park for years so were shocked to find the wet area closed - it was particularly upsetting for George and Molly. 

'Upon investigating we were told the opening hours had been reduced due to one nearby resident complaining about the noise of children playing. 

'It's beyond belief someone would complain about children having fun - I'm sure the traffic noise from the main road is far more disruptive.'
