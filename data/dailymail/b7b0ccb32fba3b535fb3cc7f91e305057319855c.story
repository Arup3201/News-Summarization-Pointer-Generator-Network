Benfica are interested in Manchester United goalkeeper Anders Lindegaard who is available for sale.

His agent Michael Stensgaard said: 'Anders would consider staying in England, but he is actually open to other opportunities too.'

Stensgaard told Danish news agency Ritzau: 'The important thing is the package is right considering the family, the sport ambitions and of course the finances.'

Lindegaard has failed to dislodge David De Gea as United's No 1 and Louis van Gaal preferred to use English youngsters Ben Amos and Sam Johnstone in pre-season.
