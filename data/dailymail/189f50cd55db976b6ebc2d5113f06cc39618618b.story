Opposed: Ed Miliband and Labour voted against the benefits cap

Working families would have to earn more than £41,000 a year to get the same as many living on state benefits if the Labour Party was in charge of the welfare  system, the Tories claimed last night.

The Government’s benefit cap – introduced yesterday – limits the amount of money a household can claim in  welfare payments to £26,000 a year, the before-tax income of the average  working family.

Ed Miliband’s party opposes the cap and voted against it in the Commons, even though opinion polls show that it is hugely popular with the public.

Official figures, contained in an impact assessment of the policy, show that on  average those who will see their benefits capped will lose £4,836 a year: about £93 a week.

A working family would need a pre-tax salary of £32,000 to match the £26,000 a year in state handouts allowed under the cap.

But if nothing had changed and Labour got its way, the benefits claimants hit by the cap would have been given nearly £31,000 and a working family would need £41,000 before tax to match them.

Tory MPs seized on the figures as evidence that Labour’s opposition to welfare reform discriminates against those who work.

The cap was introduced yesterday in four London boroughs – Haringey, Enfield, Croydon and Bromley – and will be rolled out nationwide from September.

It does not affect those on disability benefits or anyone working more than 16 hours a week and claiming working tax credits.

The cap limits will be set at £500 a week for couples, with or without children, and lone parent households and at £350 a week for households of a single adult with no children.

Clear message: Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said days of 'outrageous claims giving people incomes far above those of hard-working families are over'

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘We have a very clear message: we will provide support to those who need it, but the days of outrageous claims giving people incomes far above those of hard-working families are over.’

Tory chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Conservatives are firmly on the side of people who want to work hard and get on in life.

‘Unbelievably, Labour oppose capping benefits. They’ve got no idea – they want some out-of-work households to be able to claim an average £4,800 a year more in benefits than the average working family takes home in wages.’

Ministers also repeated their claim that the introduction of the benefit was already persuading people to return to work.

The Department of Work and Pensions published figures last week showing that the number of families affected by the cap has been cut from 56,000 to 40,000.

Of these, 8,000 have got a job and another 8,000 have disappeared from welfare rolls.

Critics have claimed the figures are not proof of behavioural change in those affected.

But DWP minister Mark Hoban said: ‘I don’t know how much time [they’ve] spent in JobCentres in recent months, I suspect not very much. I’ve been talking to people who have been implementing these changes, and the very clear message is that this has provided a spur to people, to get them thinking about getting into work, whereas perhaps in the past they haven’t.’

Mr Miliband responded to the criticism by saying: ‘We’re in favour of a benefit cap but it’s got to be adjusted regionally.’

Labour work and pensions spokesman Liam Byrne said: ‘Ministers have got this so badly wrong that even members of the Cabinet think it will cost more than it saves.

‘The truth is the benefits bill is soaring £21billion higher than expected because this government is failing to create jobs and the  welfare revolution we were promised is descending into chaos.’

But business leaders backed the Government. Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: ‘The benefits cap establishes a sensible principle, that welfare should not pay more than working.

‘It is morally wrong as well as economically damaging to have a benefits system that prices employers out of the market. This is a welcome move.’
