London's Oxford Street showcases the fast pace of the capital, but hidden 70-feet below the tarmac is a deserted network of damp and derelict tunnels.

Mail Rail, an underground railway, was abandoned in 2003, but now an architect firm has come up with an idea to transform the space into a subterranean mushroom garden.

Pop Down is designed to be an urban experience where visitors can
embark on an expedition, entering and exiting the tunnels 
from street level.

Hidden network: Until 2003, Mail Rail, an underground railway carried 7 million letters and parcels across London each year

 Until 2003, Mail Rail, carried 7 million letters and parcels across London each year.

The underground unmanned train service 
started in 1927.

Travelled 23 miles of 2ft gauge track linking 
Whitechapel in the East End with Paddington in west London.

Initially
the Mail Rail line ran 22 hours a day, its staff working in three 
shifts.

This service was later reduced to 19 hours a day, 286 days a 
year.

Its closure came when
Royal Mail announced the line had become uneconomical with losses of 
£1.2M a day and that they planned to close it should no alternate uses 
be found.

The innovative idea claimed Fletcher 
Priest Architects first place in the High Line competition which aims to
find imaginative new green space in the capital.

The experience would be lit at street-level with sculptural glass-fibre mushrooms.

Fletcher Priest Architects said: 'The tunnels provide the ideal 
environment for an urban mushroom farm with the introduction of daylight
through a series of sculptural glass-fibre ‘mushrooms’ at street level.'

'These will highlight 
the route of the tunnel above ground and will convey daylight to the 
tunnels below through punctures along their length.

'The produce will serve new pop-up concept ‘Funghi’ restaurants and cafés at each entrance.'

It looks not dissimilar to the London Underground and the stations are a miniature version of the Tube at platform level.

The Lido Line: An idea to insert a clean, safe 'basin' in the Regent's Canal in which to swim the 'Lido Line' from Little Venice to Limehouse

The New River: Breathing new life into a forgotten waterway and collecting fresh water at source in Stoke Newington

Initially
the Mail Rail line ran 22 hours a day, its staff working in three 
shifts.

This service was later reduced to 19 hours a day, 286 days a 
year.

Its closure came when
Royal Mail announced the line had become uneconomical with losses of 
£1.2 million a day and that they planned to close it should no alternate uses 
be found.

Runner-up in the competition was claimed by The 'Lidoline' which would create a special commuter lane in Regent's Canal, which spans London.

High, Low, Fast and Fluid Lines: A commuter cycleway on raised railway viaducts, ¿air rail¿ gardens by railway sidings, a new green Blackfriars Bridge and flower shows on the Thames

London Parks Library: Establishes small book exchanges within parks and green spaces, and traces the invisible network and movement of books and people

Green Arteries: A scheme to transform London's flyovers into productive and beautiful green arteries, to reduce heat effect and traffic noise and encourage biodiversity

'We thought that another new open 
space was a little redundant - the problem is those spaces are 
underused,' said David Lomax of Y/N Studios, which developed the idea.

'We would create a network to link those areas together.

'The obvious thing was the Regents Canal - it runs through London, but is sporadically used, and is rarely used in its entirety.

The judging panel, included Joshua David 
and Robert Hammond, co-founders of New York’s High Line, Dr Penelope 
Curtis, Director of Tate Britain, Mark Brearley, Head of Design for 
London, and leading landscape architects Kim Wilkie and Jo Gibbons.

Street Orchard: Creates mini orchards around bus shelters, featuring beehives within the trees and sloping sedum roofs to collect fruit and rainwater

Structure: Biocentric 'mats' and 'sleeves' are layered onto buses, trams and trains to create mobile gardens

Barge Walk: Connects people with water via the creation of a linear park, farm and wetland on floating barges at the edge of Canary Wharf

Lea Valley Rain Farm: Create a 'rain farm' in the Lea Valley to store run-off and rainwater to serve the local neighbourhood

Mr David, co-founder, Friends of the High Line said: 'Between the ‘Pop Down’ and ‘Lido Line’ proposals and the three highly commended entries, the competition puts forward a group of creative ideas that are in some cases fantastic, in others realistic. 

'They all have the power to help us look at London and green infrastructure in innovative and unexpected ways.'

Although the ideas are all at a design stage, many supporters of the winner and runner-up are calling for them to become a reality.

The High Line competition was inspired by New York’s popular High Line urban park, situated on a disused elevated railway road.
