The ultra-bronzed woman dubbed Tanning Mom - following claims that she took her then five-year-old daughter into a tanning booth - has big sunbathing plans now that the criminal case against her has been dropped.

Patricia Krentcil, 44, a mother-of-five from Nutley, New Jersey, told NBC News that she wants to go 'somewhere 
hot so I can fry like a bacon and come back and say, ''Ha! Ha! You can't 
arrest me for lying in the sun.''

She also revealed that she has been working on a tanning lotion line, titled Real Tan Mom Healthy Glow, in a bid to pay back the thousands in legal bills she owes.

Tanning Mom Patricia Krentcil appeared on This Morning via webcam to defend herself and her tanning habits

Mrs
 Krentcil was arrested last April and charged with second-degree child endangerment for allegedly bringing her young daughter into a tanning booth.

The girl, who has fair skin and red hair, told a school nurse she had 'gone tanning with mommy' when staff at her school asked her about burns on her skin.

However a jury in Newark, New Jersey did not indict her in the end. Moving
 on from the dropped charges last week, Mrs Krentcil is now looking at ways to cash in on her notoriety, and along with her tanning lotion line she is working on a book and launching herself as a comedian.

'My love of tanning started when I was about 23... Everyone has some form of addictions and I liked to tan'

Following the reports in the press she was dubbed the world's worst mother in the U.S. and today Mrs Krentcil appeared on This Morning to defend herself.

'My love of tanning started when I was about 23. Everyone has some form of addictions and I liked to tan - but I never put Anna in the room.

'But I'm not tanning anymore and I was thinking how stupid it really is,' she said from a studio in New York.

Speaking about the accusations that she took her red-haired daughter in the tanning booth following burns on her pale skin, Mrs Krentcil  said: 'It's not a booth, its a room like what I'm sitting in right now with a tanning table - but she was never in the booth, I don't know how many times I have to say it.'

The saga surrounding Mrs Krentcil began when her fair-skinned, red-haired daughter Anna's teacher noticed serious burns 
on the then five-year-old's body

Explaining the burns she said: 'She had a half a day, she's out in the pool and she's a redhead and had just a little bit of sunburn on her back and if she would have been in a tanning booth it would have been her whole body.'

She added: 'I was set up in this whole mess - its not true. When you ask about justice over here, I don't think there isn't any - there are liars and its very upsetting.

'If we go to court, I have witnesses. This is a big misunderstanding on everyone's part - I know exactly what happened, there's a camera in the place, the owners know I didn't do that.

'It's very frustrating. We just want to be left alone. I didn't do it - there's evidence that I didn't do it, and if they proceed on with it, so will I.'

After a month abstaining from her sunbed habit, the New Jersey mother revealed a lighter new look in an issue of In Touch last month.

Although the 44-year-old says most people think she looks better less bronzed she said she felt 'weird and pale.'

On the show today, speaking about her love of tanning beds, she said: 'I haven't been there in six months.'

Tanning Mom has made quite a name for herself because of her brash behaviour.

She was recently kicked off the stage
 during an alcohol-fuelled appearance at a New York drag show, where 
witnesses claim she shouted expletives at the audience, kicked over her 
wine glass, and even tried to 'attack' the drag queen hosting the event.

Her tanning days have taken a toll and she is barely recognisable compared to a fresh-faced photo of her in her twenties

Her latest look is a far cry from a fresh-faced twenty year old shown in a series of monochrome shots taken in her twenties.

The cleavage-baring swimwear photos are thought to have been snapped as she tried to break into the world of glamour modelling.

The shots serve as evidence of how the 44-year-old's excessive tanning habit has affected her skin over the past two decades.
