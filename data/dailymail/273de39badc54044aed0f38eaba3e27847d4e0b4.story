Swift action: Sheik Mohammed has ordered an investigation into the seizure

The owner of the scandal-hit Godolphin stable has ordered a new investigation after banned equine drugs were discovered on a Dubai government private jet when it was searched at Stansted airport.

Officers from the UK Border Agency, along with the Veterinary Medicines Directorate, seized the unlicensed products from a Dubai Royal Air Wing flight earlier this year, it has been reported.

Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, monarch of the gulf emirate, has now ordered his junior wife Her Highness Princess Haya, president of the International Federation for Equestrian Sports, to carry out an investigation into the incident.

The inquiry comes just weeks after a separate raid at Moorley Farm in Newmarket, which is owned by Godolphin’s Darley Management operation.

According to The Guardian, the shipment, apparently labelled as 'horse tack', did not include anabolic steroids.

It is believed the seizure did however contain products used on endurance horses.

A spokesman for Princess Haya told the Guardian: 'Nobody seems to know in the organisation who is buying what or where. That’s one of the reforms that they want in place.'

The spokesman said Sheik Mohammed had been unaware of the products on the flight as well as the raid at Moorley Farm.

The spokesman also said Sheikh Mohammed's operation had not been spoken to by the VMD since the seizure and blamed the presence of the drugs on 'an internal reporting error'.

Sheikh Mohammed's senior wife is Shaikha Hind bint Maktoum bin Juma Al Maktoum, a member of Dubai's ruling family Al Maktoum, who he married in 1979.

His most famous junior wife is Princess Haya, who he married on April 10, 2004.

The British Horseracing Authority has
said it has been told by Defra there was no link between the seizure 
and the racing industry.

Adam
Brickell, the BHA's director of integrity, legal and risk, said: 'This 
issue is a matter for Defra and the VMD, the agency responsible for 
issues concerning the use and manufacture of veterinary medicines in 
Britain.

'On account of our existing working 
relationship with Defra and the VMD, as fellow regulatory authorities 
with responsibilities for animals and their welfare, the BHA was 
notified of the seizure of veterinary care products, some of which are 
not licensed for use in the UK.

'Defra
have confirmed to the BHA that they consider there to be no link 
between the seizure and the racing industry and that the products were 
not intended for use on thoroughbreds.'

A Border Force spokesman said the products seized at Stansted have now been destroyed.

The spokesman told MailOnline: 'On May 3 Border Force officers at Stansted identified a quantity of veterinary products on a private plane that arrived at the airport.

'The products, which were unlicensed, had been listed as horse tack and were seized by officers.

'DEFRA (the Department for Environment, 
Food and Rural Affairs) was contacted and confirmed Border Force 
officers' identification of the medicines, which were subsequently 
removed and destroyed.

'Border Force officers are on constant 
alert to keep unlicensed, fake and illegal items from entering the 
country — including veterinary products.'

In April, former Godolphin trainer Mahmood al-Zarooni was banned for eight years after anabolic steroids were used on 22 horses in the stable.

Earlier this month it was reported Sheikh Mohammed was embroiled in another drugs controversy after 124 unauthorised veterinary products were seized at Moorley Farm East in Newmarket.

The farm, which is owned by Darley Stud, the banner company of his breeding operation, was the subject of a swoop in August by DEFRA and is a base for endurance horses owned by the Sheik’s family.

It is unknown whether the seizure at Stansted and the raid at Moorley Farm are connected.
