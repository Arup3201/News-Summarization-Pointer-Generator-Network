The FBI has agreed to review the mysterious disappearance of a honeymooner from a Caribbean cruise ship eight years ago. 

George Smith, 26, vanished from the 
Royal Caribbean ship, Brilliance of the Seas, in the middle of the night
 on July 5, 2005 just outside the Turkish port of Kusadasi. He had been partying into the early hours with his 
25-year-old wife Jennifer Hagel-Smith and a group of men.

She was found passed out drunk in a corridor but George was missing - a large blood stain beneath his cabin balcony indicating he had fallen and then went overboard.

Mystery: George Smith was on a honeymoon cruise with his new wife Jennifer Hagel-Smith when he died - presumed overboard

Partying: The couple had been drinking and gambling with new friends they'd made aboard the ship when it is believed Smith went overboard around 5am

After an eight year campaign his family this week got the answer they've been waiting for - FBI officers in New York will review his case and their suspicions that foul play was involved.

'Yesterday we put a circle on the calendar because that's the day we felt we went from a minus to a plus and we felt finally we were going to get answers,' George's father, who is also named George, told CNN.

'A lot of evidence has been accumulated now and I think with a fresh set of eyes looking at that evidence that arrests are inevitable,' George's sister, Bree Smith added to the broadcaster.

Four men confirm they were the last to see George alive on the dream cruise he had planned with his new wife.

Josh Askin, Rusty Kofman and Zach and Greg Rozenberg were also traveling on the ship with their families.

The group had all been drinking Absinthe and gambling with the newly-married man earlier in the evening.

They claim they left a drunken George
 in his room and put him in bed, before returning to Zach and Rusty's 
suite to order room service.

However, a private investigator hired
 by the family told CBS's 48 hours that the ship's records show no 
details of any room service order.

Several short phone calls were made 
from the suite following 4.13am, according to Attorney Mike Jones, but 
no food was documented as ordered on the ship's log.

He also points out a video
 exists of three of the men - Kofman and the two Rosenberg brothers - 
allegedly 'joking' about Mr Smith's death over breakfast.

Though the FBI has held the recording since 2005, Jones made public its alleged contents for the first time.

He claims Kofman makes a joke about 
the man parachuting off his balcony while Greg Rosenberg stands up at 
the end and 'makes gang signs' and says 'told you I was a gangster'.

All four men and lawyers acting on their behalf have denied any involvement in the death of Smith from Greenwich, Connecticut.

CBS approached Kofman in the film and
 questioned him about the alleged video comment. He said he had no 
comment and urged the presenter to contact his lawyer.

Albert Dayan who was previously represented him was interviewed by the network in 2006 and said the men put the newlywed in bed and never saw him again.

'They actually lay George on the bed 
and took off his shoes and he displays tremendous gratitude to these 
young men,' he told the broadcaster.

Cabin: This is the room where the men claim they left George Smith in bed

However, one witness - a former 
police officer staying next door to the couple - told CBS he only saw 
three men leave the suite - something the men also deny.

He also claims he heard men arguing on the balcony.

Dayan said he believed the 'three 
men' spotting was a mistake by the witness and says the men deny ever 
going onto the balcony.

The neighbor said he later heard the sound of furniture being moved and a loud thud.

The witness reports, cell phone video
 and room service logs have prompted the Smith family to call for a 
thorough new look at George's death.

They suspect foul play.

'I just don't understand how the FBI 
could have had this tape in their possession and still we sit here,' 
George's sister Bree said. 'Get the guys in there. Question them!

In another new detail, it has emerged
 that the men and their families were later ejected from the ship in 
Naples over a claim of sexual assault against Greg Rosenberg and Rusty 
Koffman.

The men also denied those claims and no charges were brought by Italian police.

Jones carried out depositions with all four men in the course of his inquiries.

Greg Rosenberg, who was being held in a Florida prison on charges of trafficking, emphatically denied any involvement.

Never found: Mr Smith, 26, fell from the boat during a Mediterranean cruise close to the port of Kusadasi in Turkey

Although he added that he too doubted the explanation George fell.

'Something crazy went down that night and I hope one day they find out the truth,' he said. 

Josh Ashkin's lawyer says he has no doubt his client has provided all the information he has on the incident and believes it boils down to a drunken accident.

'I don't know why anybody's missin' the theme here. 'Cause there's one common element ... and it's too much alcohol!' he said.

'And we can go and, you know, blame it on murder and - and -- and blame it on aggressive sexual behavior here. You know what? It's just everybody drinkin' too much and stupid stuff happening. That fits.'

FBI New York confirmed to the broadcaster that they would review the investigation.

The honeymooner's family have been 
frustrated by the investigation to date but hope the renewed focus may 
bring them the answers they require.

'We'll get justice,' George's mother 
Maureen Smith said. 'Somehow we'll get justice for George. Somebody will
 talk. And shame on them that don't. Shame on the people that have put 
us through this eight years of hell.'

Much-loved: The Smiths of Greenwich, Connecticut say they still need answers over the night their son died

'He was the funniest guy, you know?' George Smith senior said remembering his son.

'I would sit and have a couple of beers with him and he'd make me laugh 
for the whole night. And besides he was so good looking the girls just 
fell all over him. He was a just a lot of fun. He was a great guy.'

Jennifer Hagel-Smith, an elementary 
school teacher,  passed an FBI polygraph test about what happened that 
night and Jones believes she too was an innocent victim of what 
occurred.

The couple had been together for three years when they married in 2005 in a clifftop ceremony in Newport, Rhode Island.

She has since remarried and did not take part in the CBS program.
