An experienced angler got the shock of his life when he was out on a fishing trip and reeled in what he thought was a large barramundi and instead pulled in a 4.5 metre saltwater crocodile.

Sean Parr was on a barramundi charter on the Corrobaree Billabong in the Northern Territory when the group he was with decided to stop for lunch and throw out a few fishing lines on the bank while they rested.

After reeling in a few catfish, Sean threw out his line and felt it catch.

Experienced angler Sean Parr almost reeled in this four and a half metre crocodile while on recent fishing trip

'I looked and saw lots of bubbles coming out of the water,' Sean told Daily Mail Australia.

'I turned to one of the other guys and said, 'I think that's a croc! He said, 'Nah, it couldn't be.'

'The next minute a four and a half meter crocodile came to the surface! It was insane.'

Sean said he had never heard or seen a thing like it, and neither had any of the others on the trip.

'It's behaviour was really weird,' Sean said.

'It was really timid, considering it had a hook in it's mouth. It hissed a bit but it didn't go anywhere near us,'

The fisherman said he nor anyone on the charter with him that day had ever seen anything like it 

'I thought it would have thrashed, but it almost seemed sedated. Eventually we got the tension off the line because we didn't want to hurt it.'

Sean said that the boat came up close to the crocodile so that Sean could release the massive saltwater creature.

'I went with Darwin Barra Base Safari Adventures, and they were such good guys. The host Paul was amazing about it all, and even he had said he'd never seen anything like it.' 

'It was certainly something I've never seen before and probably never will again. I've seen a few small sharks but never a four and a half meter saltwater crocodile.'

Sean was surprised by how calm the giant reptile was while he was releasing him

Another family on the charter boat from New Zealand were fascinated by the crocodile (not pictured)

'There was a family from New Zealand with us, and they were buzzing.' 

Sean said that he was astounded by the size of the animal, and was excited to go home and tell his family what he'd seen.

'I went home and told my son, 'Dad went fishing today. Guess what he caught?,' Sean said.

'He guessed a shark, and then I said, no, a crocodile.'

Sean said he posted it online because he was so amazed and wanted other people to be able to see it.

'How many people get to say they've caught a saltwater crocodile? Although I didn't really catch it, we did let it go after all.'

Sean said he was astounded by the size of the animal, and was excited to go home and tell his family
