BBC political editor Nick Robinson has attacked Russell Brand for urging the public not to vote in the general election.

He said he had ‘a beef’ with the comedian and was an ‘unapologetic believer in elections’ after his German Jewish grandparents had to flee both the Nazis and then the Communists in China.

Brand was also dismissed by Ed Balls yesterday as a ‘pound shop Ben Elton’ after the self-styled revolutionary called the Shadow Chancellor ‘clicky-wristed’ and a ‘snidey ****’. 

Critique: BBC political editor Nick Robinson says he has 'beef' with Russell Brand over his campaign urging the public not to vote in the general election

Robinson, 51, told Radio Times he had some things he wanted to get off his chest ‘at the beginning of a year that will determine not just who governs Britain but the future of the country itself’.

He insisted that politicians are not all the same and are not all in it for themselves, and ‘it does make a difference whether you vote or not and who you vote for’. 

He went on: ‘Are you listening, Russell Brand, and admirers of the man with the most manicured chest in Britain?

‘You see I’ve got a bit of a beef with Brand. More than anyone I can remember in recent times he has energised, excited and enthused people about some of the great issues of our time.

‘And yet Brand continues to tell people that all politics and all politicians are corrupt or venal or a waste of time.

Make up your mind! Russell Brand says he only discourages voting because there is no one good enough to vote for, but has previously written that he discourages voting altogether

‘These days he pretends that he’s only ever argued that there’s no one worth voting for, but not very long ago he wrote in the New Statesman – “I will never vote and I don’t think you should, either”.’

Brand’s recent book Revolution encouraged people not to vote in order to bring about a collapse in government. 

He has discussed his views on Newsnight and had a stylist straighten his chest hair before appearing on Question Time. 

Brand, 39, who has a fortune of around £9million, has been labelled a champagne socialist after leaving an anti-capitalist protest to attend a glitzy West End party.

He also campaigned for more low-cost housing, despite living in a rented £2million home owned by a firm based in a tax haven.

Robinson said he had asked Brand for an interview, ‘but as he posed for a few selfies I was told he was too busy’. 

He added that it was his job to be impartial when reporting for the BBC, but ‘I am not required to be impartial between democracy and the alternatives. If Auntie ever asked me to be I’d refuse.

‘My German Jewish grandparents were forced to flee the Nazis and then, later, the Communists who took over China, the place they’d sought refuge. In this election year I am an unapologetic believer in elections’.

Brand, who last month called Nigel Farage a ‘pound shop Enoch Powell’, turned his sights on Ed Balls at the weekend, saying on Channel 4’s Big Fat Quiz of the Year: ‘I shook his hand once. All clicky-wristed, he was a snidey ****.’

The Shadow Chancellor told the BBC’s Emily Maitlis: ‘I’m not quite sure what clicky-wristed means. I don’t know whether that’s supposed to be offensive or funny or whatever.’

He added: ‘He’s quite funny sometimes. I think probably Jo Brand is a rather better political commentator. I suppose you could call him a pound shop Ben Elton.’
