Nine-man Cardiff survived a late Brentford onslaught to dent the home side's promotion charge with a smash-and-grab 2-1 win.

All the goals came from goalkeeping blunders in a game which ended with Kadeem Harris and Federico Macheda both seeing red for Cardiff.

Andre Gray gave the home side a first-half lead, but goals from Macheda and Alex Revell turned things round for Cardiff.

The Welsh club came to west London with a game plan to stifle the fluent Bees by breaking the game up at every opportunity, and Brentford at times looked rattled by their physical approach.

Yet the Bees took the lead midway through the first half after a howler by their former stopper Simon Moore, who could only parry Alex Pritchard's dipping free-kick into the path of Gray to bundle home from close range.

The hosts should have put the game beyond doubt by the break, only an acrobatic Moore save denying Pritchard's deflected looping shot.

Jota also caused havoc down the right flank and Gray twice went close to extending the lead before the break.

However, the Bluebirds upped the physical stakes after the interval and made Brentford pay for a lacklustre display.

Macheda drew them level on 53 minutes when Brentford goalkeeper David Button collided with his own centre-back Harlee Dean and dropped the ball into the path of the Italian, who slid home from 12 yards.

And the comeback was complete on 68 minutes when Button raced off his line to intercept a hopeful through ball and was caught in no man's land for Revell to chip home into the empty goal.

However, the sheen was taken off the win by two red cards for the Welshmen.

Harris, on loan at Griffin Park last season, was the first to go on 78 minutes, having come on as a half-time sub, for a reckless lunge on Bees midfielder Alan Judge.

And former Manchester United striker Macheda followed him to the dressing room with minutes remaining for a second yellow card.

That sparked a frantic spell of pressure from Brentford which saw James Tarkoswski head over when well placed and Tommy Smith's goal-bound drive blocked by a melee of City bodies as Russell Slade's men held on.

Cardiff almost snatched a third deep into stoppage time, but Kenwyne Jones squandered a gilt-edged chance to give the scoreline a flattering feel by blazing over after racing on to a through ball with the home defence committed.

CHARLTON 1-3 BLACKBURN 

A clinical double from Blackburn striker Jordan Rhodes ensured victory against lacklustre Charlton. 

It was Blackburn’s third win of the season over Charlton, having already beaten them 2-0 in the reverse fixture and 2-1 in the FA Cup at the Valley.

Gary Bowyer’s side have now lost only one of their last nine games in all competitions, and the win keeps alive slim play-off hopes. 

Craig Conway was also on target for Blackburn, while Yoni Buyens pulled one back from the spot. 

Bowyer was delighted with Scottish international Rhodes, and said: ‘I thought his two goals were outstanding quality. The second one is a great piece of poaching and a sublime finish, and the first one is an unbelievable finish from a great bit of quick play from us.’

LEEDS 0-0 NOTTINGHAM FOREST 

Dougie Freedman was happy to go home with a draw after Nottingham Forest’s stalemate at Leeds. 

Forest had won six of their first eight games under the Scot to raise hopes of a late run to the play-offs. There was no denying Forest had the better moments as Chris Burke and Ben Osborn drew smart saves from Leeds keeper Marco Silvestri, but they could not get past the Italian and headed back down the M1 with a point. 

Freedman said: ‘I’m happy with a point. Because of the run we’re on and the standards we’ve set, we expect to win games. ‘We have to be realistic and to come to Leeds and get a point is a good result. We were the better team, and we had better chances.’

ROTHERHAM 1-2 WIGAN

Wigan kept survival hopes alive as two free-kicks from Jermaine Pennant helped close the gap on Rotherham. The win was Malky Mackay’s side’s fourth straight away victory, and gives them a glimmer of hope ahead of the end-of-season run in. 

Mackay said: ‘Jermaine’s delivery on both was sensational. It’s not until you look at it again that you see exactly what he did, and how he has executed them.’ Matt Derbyshire pulled one back, but it was not enough to save Rotherham.

BIRMINGHAM 1-1 HUDDERSFIELD 

Joe Lolley, a product of Birmingham’s academy, returned to St Andrew’s to earn Huddersfield a rare away point with a vital equaliser.

Making only his third start since being signed from Kidderminster for £300,000 a year ago, the 22-year-old justified manager Chris Powell’s decision to play him against his former club when he cancelled out David Cotterill’s opener. 

Powell said: ‘Joe is a real natural talent, but I would like to see the day when he can last 90 minutes. ‘We are just trying to cajole him. We are trying to get that talent shown regularly out on the pitch.’

SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY 1-1 FULHAM

Stuart Gray felt his Sheffield Wednesday side should have been given a free-kick for diving in the build-up to Fulham’s equaliser.

Fulham midfielder Ryan Tunnicliffe went down in the Wednesday area before poking the ball to goalscorer Matt Smith in the 75th minute. The goal cancelled out a header from Wednesday substitute Stevie May. 

Gray said: ‘I think the referee shouted play-on because he presumed the lad had dived. That’s what the lads are saying, so if he thought he dived you would have thought he’d have pulled up and given us a free-kick. You’re taught as a kid to play until the whistle goes, and we did seem to stop.’

BOLTON 2-0 MILLWALL  

Neil Lennon described Adam Le Fondre as a ‘priceless commodity’ after watching his on-loan striker shoot down Millwall.

Le Fondre now has five goals in 10 games since his arrival from Cardiff, and Bolton boss Lennon said: ‘They were two great finishes, and he is our joint second top-scorer and he has only been in the building since late January. 

‘It is a priceless commodity being a goalscorer, and he has done that his whole career.’ 

New Millwall manager Neil Harris admitted: ‘We are in a difficult position, and there are no promises from anyone in the dressing room as to what we are going to do.’

BRIGHTON 1-1 WOLVES 

A late goal from Rajiv van La Parra rescued a point for play-off chasers Wolves. Spanish defender Bruno Saltor raised hopes of a fourth successive home win for Brighton, but Wolves hit back to equalise four minutes later when Van La Parra’s cross went in off David Stockdale. 

The Brighton keeper then produced a brilliant late save to deny Bakary Sako, and Wolves manager Kenny Jackett said: ‘It was a close game, and a fantastic save at the end to deny us. 

‘We have to keep pushing. Two teams above us lost and we have two important games coming up. We would have loved three points, but thin dividing lines decide games. ‘A number of clubs are looking for promotion, and it is still open for us.’
