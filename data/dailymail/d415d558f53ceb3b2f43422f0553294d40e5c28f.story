A family was ordered off an easyJet flight because of a small cut on their little girl’s cheek – then ‘abandoned’ for three days.

After a short break in Jersey, Laura Bishop was waiting for take-off when a stewardess noticed the red mark beneath her toddler’s eye, and the pilot decided they could not fly for health and safety reasons.

Hours earlier, 19-month-old Robyn had fallen and cut her cheek on a radiator, but it was not causing her pain and did not require a plaster.

Fed up: Pregnant Laura Bishop and 19-month-old daughter Robyn were kicked off a flight back home from Jersey because of a small cut on Robyn's face - incurring £600 in extra hotel bills for the family

After suffering the humiliation of 
having to collect their bags from the plane’s hold and return to the 
terminal, Miss Bishop, who is heavily pregnant, claims the budget 
airline ‘abandoned’ them.

Miss Bishop, 36, her engineer partner
John Maitland, 33, and Robyn had to wait three days for the next 
available flight home from Jersey to Newcastle as well as obtain a 
medical certificate declaring it was safe for Robyn to travel.

She claims easyJet gave them no help 
in finding transport or accommodation on the island, which ended up 
costing them an extra £600, and the delay meant Miss Bishop, who is more
than seven months pregnant, missed her scheduled baby scan.

After finally returning home to 
Morpeth in Northumberland, Miss Bishop warned parents: ‘Beware of going 
on holiday with children – you might not be able to bring them back if 
they fall over.’

She accused the airline of deserting them and added: ‘I would never fly with easyJet again.’

The family had enjoyed a four-day 
break in the Channel Islands earlier this month and were in their seats 
preparing for take-off when the pilot came over and said they had to 
leave.

Miss Bishop said: ‘I couldn’t believe
it. I started crying and I was pleading with him, saying, “This is 
ridiculous, we’re only going to Newcastle, it’s about an hour’s flight,”
but he insisted that he wouldn’t fly us.

‘The pilot said he was worried the 
injury might get worse during the flight and he had to think about all 
the other passengers’ safety.

‘I kept saying it wasn’t her eye, it 
was the skin below her eye. It’s just a little red mark on her face. 
It’s not even going to scar. It wasn’t deep. It didn’t really bleed at 
all.

‘He said he couldn’t say what would 
happen, like she was going to explode or something. The whole plane was 
sat looking at us. It was embarrassing.’

Stranded: easyJet said the decision to stop Robyn from flying was taken in her best interests because the injury could have got worse while in the air

Scarred: Robyn, 19 months, today bears only a little mark on her eye from the cut that prevented her and her family from flying on an easyJet flight

Miss Bishop said they took Robyn to see a doctor who said he thought the decision was ‘ridiculous’.

‘I think it’s crazy,’ she added. ‘It’s health and safety gone mad.’

An easyJet spokesman said: ‘The crew 
advised the family they believed the injury could worsen in flight due 
to the effect of cabin pressure. As such they requested that the 
passengers disembark to seek medical attention.

‘The actions of our crew were in the best interests of the child.’

The airline says it has now paid compensation to the family for the inconvenience.
