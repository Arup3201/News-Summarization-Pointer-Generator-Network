A man died after he was shot with a Taser by police responding to reports of a row between neighbours.

Jordan Begley, 23, is suspected to have had a heart attack after being hit by the 50,000 volt charge outside his home.

His mother Dorothy had called police when the disturbance threatened to get out of hand.

Jordan Begley was hit with a stun gun when he went back inside his house. The 23-year-old had a heart condition and is believed to have had a heart attack

Up to a dozen officers – some of them
armed – turned up in the quiet residential street following reports 
that the ice cream factory worker had a knife.

He was hit with a Taser stun gun when he went back inside his house, and collapsed on the floor.

Officers and paramedics tried to resuscitate him before he was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead.

It
later emerged that Mr Begley of Gorton, Manchester, had a heart 
condition and the electric charge from the Taser may have caused a 
massive heart attack.

There
were initial reports that officers may have confused him with a wanted 
criminal with exactly the same name in the area, but this was 
strenuously denied by the police.

His
distraught mother, a 50-year-old café owner and well-respected 
community figure, told friends: ‘They’ve killed my son, they’ve killed 
my son.’ Yesterday the shutters were down at Dot’s Café with a sign 
saying: ‘Cafe closed due to bereavement.’

A sign was posted on the cafe's door this morning informing customers of the incident

The
incident – the latest to raise serious questions about the increasing 
use of Taser weapons – is being investigated by the Independent Police 
Complaints Commission.

In 2011 in the UK, Tasers were fired by police at least 1,081 times, compared with 744 in 2010 – a 45 per cent rise.

One
victim, a blind man who was Tasered in the street in Chorley, 
Lancashire, last year after officers mistook his white cane for a 
samurai sword, accused police of indiscriminate use of a ‘killing 
machine’.

Retired architect
Colin Farmer, 62, said: ‘It is absolutely devastating that another 
person has lost their life as a result of officers’ Taser use. This is 
yet another reminder that we need to change the Taser laws in this 
country and officers need to be held properly accountable when they pull
the trigger.’ 

The tragedy
involving Mr Begley occurred at 8pm on Wednesday after he returned home
to Gorton from his job at Sivori’s ice cream factory in nearby 
Levenshulme.

It is 
understood he became involved in a row with a neighbour outside the 
terraced home he shared with his mother and brother Jake, 17.

Best
friend Adam McAllister, 22, said: ‘It was just a domestic and then the 
police arrived. There was some discussion outside before Jordan went 
into the house.

‘These 
officers followed him into the house, turfed his mother out and then 
they Tasered him and now he’s dead. I feel like my friend has been 
murdered.

Police are saying he had a knife and was dangerous but no one saw him with a knife.’

He
said Mrs Begley had gone to see her son at the hospital and was shocked
to see he had two black eyes and strangulation marks around his throat 
and bruises all over his body.

Mr
McAllister added: ‘This is a rough neighbourhood but Jordan was one of 
the good ones.’ Kirstie Porter, 21, said: ‘I can’t believe this could 
happen to such a nice lad.’

Mr
Begley’s boss Peter Sivori, 77, was driving past when he saw Mr Begley 
who waved at him. Mr Sivori said he told a policeman he was Mr Begley’s 
employer and asked the officer if he wanted him to ‘come over’, but was 
told to move on.

He added: 
‘Jordan has always been respectful to me so I would have asked what’s 
wrong. All I can say is that if I would have been able to speak to him I
think I would have calmed him down.’

Police said the man 'suffered a medical episode' before being taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead

Mr Sivori, who drove off before the incident escalated, added: ‘He was first class, a bit quietish but he was hard working.’

Greater
Manchester Police assistant chief constable Garry Shewan said: ‘Police 
received a 999 call reporting a disturbance on Beard Road in Gorton 
where there was a man with a knife.

‘Officers
were dispatched immediately and arrived in eight minutes. On arrival, a
Taser was discharged to detain a 23-year-old man. At this time it is 
unclear what happened, but at some point afterwards the man suffered a 
medical episode.’

Campaigners say Tasers can cause cardiac arrhythmia in people who have heart conditions, leading to cardiac arrest.

In
June last year the Police Federation, which represents rank and file 
officers, wrote to the Prime Minister calling for every frontline 
officer to have access to a Taser.

There are 12,000 Tasers on UK streets, but under the federation’s plans that would rise to 36,000.
