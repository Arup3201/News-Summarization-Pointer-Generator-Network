Arsenal are set to turn to Olympiakos centre-half Kostas Manolas in their search for Thomas Vermaelen's replacement.

Arsene Wenger wants to bolster his central defensive options following Vermaelen's departure to Barcelona.

And Manolas, 23, is emerging as a leading contender to fill the void vacated by the Belgium interntional.

Experience: Manolas played for Greece in the World Cup, when he came up against Arsenal's Joel Campbell

The defender was part of Greece's respectable World Cup campaign and has played for Olympiacos in the Champions League.

The key stumbling block towards the Gunners' interest in Manolas is likely to be persuading him to join without the guarantee of regular first-team football.

Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny - who is nursing an Achilles injury - are Wenger's first-choice central defensive pairing.

Big challenge:The Olympiacos centre-back tackles Edin Dzeko during a pre-season friendly 

Replacement: Arsene Wenger wants the defender to replace Thomas Vermaelen after the Belgian joined Barca

Likewise, new signing Calum Chambers has been excellent at centre-back during pre-season.

But following Vermaelen's departure, Wenger wants an established centre-back to compete with Koscielny, Mertesacker and Chambers next season.

Competition: Young defender Chambers has impressed during pre-season but Wenger wants another body
