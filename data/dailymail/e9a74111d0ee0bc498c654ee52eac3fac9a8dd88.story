Manchester United fans have been banned from taking tablets and laptops into Old Trafford because of terror fears.

The club say they are reacting to 'security advice', with electronic devices over a certain size, including iPads, banned.

An FAQ on the club website read that 'the scale of Old Trafford and profile of Manchester United mean that the risk at this venue is unique.'

Restriction: Manchester United fans have been banned from taking tablets and laptops into Old Trafford

Fanbase: 'The scale of Old Trafford and profile of Manchester United mean that the risk at this venue is unique'

The latest restriction joins other prohibited items at the 76,000-seater stadium, and is designed to ensure the safety of supporters.

Mobile phones and small lens cameras will be permitted should they be small enough, while a statement said the restriction was in line with electronic equipment checks at airports. 

United are heading into a new era with Louis van Gaal at the helm, and welcome their first visitors of the Premier League season on Saturday in Swansea.

The club hosted Valencia in a pre-season friendly on Tuesday, but did not reveal to The Sun how many items were confiscated. 

Meanwhile, the Premier League and Greater Manchester Police told the BBC that they had nothing to do with the ban.

But Manchester United's rival Arsenal issued a statement: 'Our ground regulations haven't changed. Our stadium management team are happy with our procedures.'
