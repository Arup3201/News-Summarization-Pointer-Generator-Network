While Steve was on a night out in Dublin, he met a woman called Jess and asked for her number.

She said yes and, being a gentleman, he decided to send her a polite text message to see how she was the following morning. 

But in a cruel twist of fate, the number ended up being wrong - and instead he sent a message to the administrator of Paddy Power's Twitter account.

Prank: The administrator of the Paddy Power betting account tells 400,000 followers that they have received a text from a wrong number and decides what to do

Wrong number: The message is from a man called Steve, believing he is texting a girl he met the night before. The company begin replying to him

Coverage: The conversation is broadcast over Twitter - but Steve still believes he is talking to a girl called Jess 

Without telling Steve he had the wrong number, the member of the company's social media team started replying to his messages, pretending they were the girl from Diceys Bar in Dublin.

They then decided to broadcast the exchange on the social media site, keeping their 400,000 followers up to date with the flirtatious exchange.  

The poor punter was known as 'Wrong Number Steve' throughout the conversation, but his number was never revealed. 

He began by saying: 'Hey Jess, this is Steve from Dicey's. How's the head today?' 

Act: The member of the PR team from the betting giants keep up the act during the flirtatious conversation - adding in spelling and grammar errors. They also start to mention sport when Steve asks about Jess's plans

Lucky pants: The pair start talking about their plans for the evening. Steve asks whether Jess is free tomorrow evening 

'Uncle Paddy': The social media team member jokingly pretends that their uncle - named after the company - is taking them to the races at Curragh in County Kildare, Ireland 

Scene of the encounter: Steve met Jess at Diceys bar in Dublin and asked for her phone number 

Paddy Power then, deciding on what to do next, posted on their account: 'Well this day just got interesting, potentially. I've just received a text that wasn't meant for me.

'Right, I've blocked out Steve's number because I'm sound that way. Help me out Twitter, what do I reply?'

After followers share their ideas, they then reply pretending to be Jess, saying: 'Hiya! Heads [sic] a little tender could use some tlc. How about u [sic]?'

The conversation then carried on, with every text message being posted on the social media site alongside some commentary - including how many 'kisses' they were putting at the end of every message and how long it was taking him to reply. 

'Tease': The conversation escalates after football is mentioned - but Steve is interrupted by a trip to the gym. However, he makes sure he can keep the exchange going when he returns  

Restart: After the Paddy Power account blows Steve a kiss, he returns and starts up the conversation again

Intimate: The exchange continues in a flirtatious manner as they begin talking about movie choices and Steve's 'beach bod'. The Tweet on the right came without a message 

Memory loss: Steve asks Jess if she remembers what they discussed while having a cigarette the night before. The Paddy Power PR member pretends they do not know and ask what happened 

At one point, when Steve asks what plans Jess has later that evening, they reply saying that 'uncle Paddy' is visiting. 

The reveal: The social media administrator starts to tell Steve what is really going on 

To add to their own PR efforts, they start mentioning the races at Curragh in County Kildare and try to uncover whether Steve is a football fan, with 'Jess' saying her ex-boyfriend followed Arsenal. 

As the conversation becomes increasingly flirtatious, the person in charge of Paddy Power's account decide to stop the act, before the prank gets out of hand. 

When they reveal their true identity, the betting company decide to give him a reward for being a 'great sport'.

The company phoned him the next morning, but Steve decided he wanted to keep his true identity a secret.

'Cat's out of the bag': The message from the Paddy Power account assures Steve his number has not been made public 

Finale: They then ask Steve if he would like a reward for being a 'good sport' - to which he obliges
