The dead will have to be dug up and reburied in deeper graves because Britain's cemeteries are almost full, MPs have claimed.

A shortage of grave space has become 'critical' in many towns - with councils having nowhere left to bury the dead.

Tory MP Sarah Wollaston urged ministers to let churches and council cemeteries re-use older graves to ease the crisis.

Traditional village graves, like this one at St Mary's church in Harmondsworth west London, are rapidly filling up, MPs have warned

Promession, or cryomation - Involves using liquid nitrogen to chill the body to -196c, leaving it so brittle that it can be ‘fragmented’ on a vibrating mat. A magnet then removes metal objects such as fillings and artificial limbs, leaving a sterile powder.

Resomation - Sees bodies placed in silk bags and submerged in an alkaline solution that has been heated to 160c. Flesh, organs and bones all dissolve under the onslaught, leaving behind a combination of green-brown fluid and white powder.

Ashes turned into diamonds - This technique utilises the fact that both human beings and diamonds are carbon-based. A body is cremated and the resulting ash is then purified at 3,000C before being further heated and pressurised into a diamond over a 16-week period.

Such a move would involve lifting out remains from graves that are more than 75-years-old, burying them deeper in the same grave and then re-using the space on top.

Many cemeteries in London are already full and are allowed, under emergency 2007 laws, to re-use old graves. But this exemption only applies to the capital.

It comes after warnings that almost half of England's cemeteries could run out of space within a generation. And in just 30 years all of Britain's public cemeteries are now expected to be full.

Dr Wollaston said that in one part of her Devon constituency there are just 16 empty burial plots left.

Sir Tony Baldry, the Tory MP who represents the Church of England in Parliament, said the law did not make it clear whether churches or local councils were responsible for providing burial space.

Local churches have traditionally provided the a town's main graveyard - but many are full and have been 'closed'.

At the same time councils are finding it increasingly difficult to find space for new cemeteries.

It emerged last year that many Town Halls were already resorting to converting car parks into cemeteries to meet the demand.

Earlier this year the Church of England moved to tackle the crisis by offering discounts for cremations rather than burial because of the shortage of space.

Dr Sarah Wollaston warned that some cemeteries in her constituency were almost full and called on ministers to consider allowing churches and Town Halls to reuse plots for new burials

Dr Wollaston's warning came during a Commons committee debate yesterday.

She asked Sir Tony about the 'critical shortage of burial places?'

The Tory MP said: 'In Kingsbridge in my constituency, there are only 16 places left.

'All the measures available have been instituted, such as using plots that have not been taken up and clearing extra ground in cemeteries, but we are now reaching a critical shortage, and I gather that the situation is repeated around the country.'

Dr Wollaston added: 'I feel that it is best to deal with this before we reach the point where there is nowhere left.

'Although this is an uncomfortable question and of course no one likes the idea of having to reuse plots. The reality is: what is the alternative?'

Sir Tony said Dr Wollaston was 'absolutely right'.

He said: 'She has identified what I suspect is something of a lacuna in the legislation about who is responsible for making provision for new cemeteries and new burial ground places.

'In my constituency, in Bicester, there are difficulties. Land around the towns is valuable as development land — farmers and landowners are not keen to give up land for new burial grounds — and it can be quite a challenge for district or town councils to provide new burial space.'

Last year, cemetery experts warned that the only way to solve the crisis was to re-use old graves.

Tim Morris, the head of the Institute of Cemetery and Crematorium Management, said: 'If the public are to continue to have access to local and affordable burial space, there is no alternative to the re-use of old, abandoned graves.'

Mr Morris added: 'Money needed to build new cemeteries could be saved, and spent on the living, through the re-use of graves.'

The Ministry of Justice has said the issue is 'under constant review'.
