Charmaine Webster is Australia's invisible woman.

The married mother of three can't get herself a driver's licence, a passport or even a fulltime job because her parents failed to register her birth 40 years ago.

Mrs Webster, 40, has been locked in a fierce battle with government agencies to be recognised as an Australian citizen ever since she tried to get her licence when she turned 17.

But now the Brisbane resident has hit a brick wall and is quickly running out of strength. 

'I feel like a freak who doesn't belong anywhere,' Mrs Webster told MailOnline.

'I can't get a licence or passport. I can't even get my own packages delivered to the post office or join a library. I can't do anything that you need to show ID for.'

Mrs Webster doesn't even know where she was born because her parents Rexford and Jennifer Black, who were always on the run from police, would strangely never tell her.

She is the youngest of five siblings, all of whom can provide a birth certificate.

'I don't care if they found me, gave birth to me or plucked me from the cabbage patch. It's a crime not to register a birth… they committed that crime but I'm being punished,' Mrs Webster said.

'My birthday was never celebrated as a child. Maybe I'm somebody else entirely but I can't get (the government) to investigate it.'

Mrs Webster has lived in Queensland since she was 12 but she has early memories of living in Western Australia when she was about three. 

She lost contact with her parents when she moved out at 16 and has managed to get by since by finding loopholes in government legislation.

She's had a tax file number and Medicare card since she was a teenager because you only needed to fill out a form at the post office back then and she has paid taxes from previous jobs and been on the electoral roll for 20-odd years.

Mrs Webster married her husband Cameron in 2001 with the help of a friend who happened to be a Justice of the Peace.

She registered for university online and completed a degree in human services at Griffith University in 2011, but it was only when she graduated and was offered a job that things became complicated.

'I couldn't work there without a birth certificate. I would have been working on Christmas Island as a counsellor. Ironically, if I was a boat person I would get more assistance,' she said.

'I have begged the Department of Immigration to help me like they would someone who came here illegally but they won't.'

Mrs Webster has contacted every state and territory in Australia for records of her birth but they have all wiped their hands of her.

The Federal Attorney Generals Office, Freedom of Information, the Human Rights Commission and her local state and federal MPS have also turned her away.

'I've done everything in my power but I've hit a brick wall. They have pushed me away for years… and now I'm seriously running out of strength,' she said.

'I am clearly an Aussie and I just need help.'
