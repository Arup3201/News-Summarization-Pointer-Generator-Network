A spy appeared in court today to deny sexually assaulting and beating a colleague.

The MI5 officer - who is known in court by the pseudonym 'Mark Barton' - is accused of attacking the female colleague between August and December last year.

Today, 'Barton' appeared at London's 
Southwark Crown Court behind a screen to deny four charges: two of 
assault, one of sexual assault and one of putting a person in fear of 
violence and harassment.

Spy base: Thames House in Millbank, London, is the headquarters of MI5

The security services officer, who will also go on trial under his false name, spoke only to deny the charges.

Although the 28-year-old is screened from the public, the jury will see him and all the witnesses.

The witnesses will also be given anonymity and be referred to by numbers and some first names, the court heard.

The defendant is allowed to go through the court process under a false name because of fears that his life would be at risk if he were to be identified.

Judge Alistair McCreath, the Recorder of Westminster, set a seven-day trial for June 24 with a pre-trial review listed for April 2.

'Barton' was released on bail with conditions of not contacting the complainant.
