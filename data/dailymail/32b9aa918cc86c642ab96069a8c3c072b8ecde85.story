Ukip leader Nigel Farage embarked on a final round of media interviews ahead of local and European elections tomorrow

Nigel Farage today claimed he would ‘do a deal with the devil’ if it meant securing a referendum on Britain leaving the European Union.

The Ukip leader said he would back a Labour or Conservative minority government if he gets MPs in the Commons next year to ensure the public get a say on the EU.

He also revealed plans to tackle the perception that his party is like a ‘one-man band’, and conceded that the pressure of the Euro election campaign had meant ‘sometimes a few cracks begin to show’.

Polls suggest Ukip will win the European Parliament elections, pushing Labour into second place and the Tories in third.

Local elections are also being held in England, with 4,216 seats and 161 councils at stake.

Mr Farage is increasingly confident that Ukip will win tomorrow’s European Parliament elections when results are announced on Sunday night.

He wants to use a victory over Labour and the Tories as a springboard to securing seats in the Commons, claiming Ukip could even hold the balance of power in the event of a hung Parliament.

Mr Farage acknowledged it was ‘moonshine’ to suggest that Ukip, which has no MPs, could win the 2015 election, but the party would target winnable seats in an effort to hold the balance of power.

He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘I would do a deal, post the next election, I would help a minority party in Westminster, I would do a deal with the devil in those circumstances if it got us a referendum.’

He claimed that Labour leader Ed Miliband would be forced to match the Tory pledge of an in-out referendum if his party does badly in this week’s elections.

David Cameron has promised a public vote on membership of the EU by the end of 2017, but Mr Farage was sceptical about the pledge.

Asked if he was saying the Prime Minister was dishonourable, Mr Farage said: ‘I'll pass on that.’

Mr Farage is planning to overhaul the Ukip operation this summer to end the perception that the party is a 'one-man band'

Mr Farage has faced intense media interest in recent weeks, which he admits has meant some 'cracks' have appeared in the campaign

On a troubled election campaign: ‘We all make mistakes in life and things don’t always go according to plan. When you’re out in front and everybody’s firing every missile they’ve got at you, yeah, sometimes a few cracks begin to show.

On being a one-man band: ‘I think in terms of the European election campaign, I have been very much the dominant figure in the campaign, yes, I accept that and I don’t think in terms of this election that’s necessarily been a handicap. I’m going to appoint, over the course of the summer, spokesmen who will take on responsibilities for specific areas and they’re the people that I’m going to push forward because I don’t think people will vote for us in a general election in big numbers if they think it’s a one-man band.’

On the general election: ‘What we will do is pursue, for 2015, a strategy not to win the general election – that would be entirely ridiculous, moonshine. But what we will do is to do what Paddy Ashdown did so brilliantly with the Lib Dems in the 1990s and that is to target our resources and to target our best people to get a good number of UKIP MPs elected in 2015 and who knows, we may get the balance of power if we get that right, and if we do there will be a referendum, whoever’s in government.’

One getting an in-out referendum: ‘‘I would do a deal, post the next election, I would help a minority party in Westminster, I would do a deal with the devil in those circumstances if it got us a referendum.’

On talks between Ukip and the Tories: ‘They don’t talk to people like me. There are no lines of communication open between Tory high command and UKIP. We are considered to be the lower orders’

On his epitaph: ‘I hope what it will say is: He led a party to win a national election on 22 May 2014 which led on to a referendum and our country getting back its democracy.’

He said 'one or two' Tory MPs were interested in running as joint Conservative-Ukip candidates in 2015 and he was 'open to having those conversations', but predicted they would be vetoed by Mr Cameron.

Some polls put Ukip ahead in the Euro elections, while others suggest Labour are in the lead.

Mr Farage insisted that Ukip had run a more professional campaign than in the past but he admitted that not everything had gone according to plan.

A ‘carnival’ staged in Croydon yesterday to prove Ukip is not racist had to be abandoned after a steel band refused to play and protesters drowned out candidates’ speeches.

Ukip strategists hoped it would be a 'bold and vibrant' event to defy their critics, but organisers were confronted with protesters likening the party to Nazis.

Mr Farage tore up plans to attend after opponents clashed with party members, the steel band walked out and a Ukip candidate branded Croydon a 'dump'.

Today Mr Farage admitted that 'we all make mistakes in life and things don't always go according to plan' and, because the party had been leading the polls ahead of tomorrow's elections, it had come under sustained pressure and 'sometimes a few cracks begin to show'.

But he insisted the party's popularity would continue beyond the European elections, and promised that a 'higher calibre' of Ukip politicians would help the party act less like a 'one-man band' in future.

'There are now people who don't just lend their votes to Ukip for European elections, they are actually Ukip voters,' he said.

'What I'm going to do over the course of the summer, and remember we are going to have a whole new load of MEPs elected, they will be a much higher calibre than anything we've ever had before.

'I am going to appoint, over the course of the summer, spokesmen to take on responsibilities for specific areas and they are the people I'm going to push forward.

'I don't think people will vote for us in a general election in numbers if they think it's a one-man band. I intend to change that over the summer.'

The comments will be seen as an admission that the party’s success cannot depend on his own personal appeal alone.

Nigel Farage once claimed he had different views on women to other men - because he had 'got so many pregnant'.

The Ukip leader, who has four children from two marriages, told an obscure Brussels magazine that he did not think women should fight on the front line in the army.

He said he might disagree with other men on this question because of his experience with women.

The bizarre comments, to Belgium's 'Up Front' magazine, came after the last general election in 2010.

He was asked if women should play football, but he said there was 'a bigger question' of whether they should be allowed into the army.

The Ukip leader said: 'Do we think, chaps, when we're there in the front line, when the balloon goes up, with fixed bayonets, when the whistle's about to blow to go over the top, do we actually want to be there with women beside us?'

A barman, working near to where the interview was taking place, shouted out: 'Yes!'

Mr Farage responded: 'Do we? What an extraordinarily bizarre idea! I certainly don't think so. But maybe it's because I've got so many women pregnant over the years that I have a different view.

Critics of Mr Farage’s leadership style have claimed he prefers to dominate the limelight.

But the pressures of a general election campaign mean he will need a bigger team around him. 

Mr Farage insisted that he has had no talks with the Tories directly, adding: 'They don’t talk to people like me. There are no lines of communication open between Tory high command and UKIP. We are considered to be the lower orders.' 

But he hinted that local deals could be done with Eurosceptic Tory MPs which would see them run on a joint ticket with Ukip.

'I think that if there is a sitting Conservative – as I say, it could be Labour too – but if there is a sitting Conservative MP who genuinely wants this country to be independent, free, self-governing and they go along to a local UKIP association and say they want to do a deal on that basis and run on a joint ticket, we would be open to that idea.'

However, Labour seized on the comments as proof that a vote for Ukip was actually a vote for the Conservatives.  

Shadow Cabinet Office minister Michael Dugher said: 'Nigel Farage has let the cat out of the bag: a vote for Ukip is a vote for the Tories.

'Ukip's policies are more Tory than the Tories. We know David Cameron cut taxes for millionaires - but Ukip want even bigger tax cuts for millionaires. We know it's harder to see your GP under David Cameron, but Ukip think the answer is to charge people to see their GP.

'Whether it's deeper cuts to public services or scrapping workers' rights, we have confirmation that Nigel Farage is actively considering shabby political deals with the Conservatives right across the country, only days after he said he'd do a deal to keep David Cameron in Number 10.

'The message is clear: vote Ukip and you don't only get policies more extreme than the Tories, you also get David Cameron.'
