Michael van Gerwen produced a stunning performance to thrash fellow Dutchman Raymond van Barneveld in week eight of the Premier League in Dublin.

The world No 1 notched up his sixth win in eight games to remain unbeaten in the tournament with a dominant 7-2 victory at the 3 Arena.

Van Gerwen, who averaged 108.71, raced into a 3-0 lead and also won the last three legs of the match to maintain his place at the top of the standings.

'It was a fantastic performance,' Van Gerwen told PDC.tv. 'We both played really well and the only disappointing thing for me in the game was the nine-darter!

'The trebles are going in really well and that's more important than the double 12 and the nine-darter. I'm playing fantastic darts, and even though I can play better I am happy with this.'

The defeat leaves Van Barneveld in elimination danger next week as he sits third from bottom in the table.

Adrian Lewis, meanwhile, remained in the bottom two after he was beaten 7-2 by Dave Chisnall in the first match of the evening.

'I didn't happen for me tonight,' said Lewis. 'Double top let me down on a few occasions and double five pulled me out of the bag a couple of times, and it's difficult to deal with.'

Chisnall said: 'I'm happy with that. Adrian wasn't at his best and he missed a few doubles, but I capitalised on that - sometimes you need a bit of luck and timing, and today I had both of those.

'I've not played my best darts in the last couple of weeks but I put it right this week. I was confident that I could get the win and I managed to get the victory.

'I've done everything right in preparation and it paid off because once I got into the lead I didn't look back, and I can't wait for Manchester next week now.'

There were no such problems for Phil Taylor, though, as he beat bottom placed Belgian Kim Huybrechts 7-4.

Taylor said: 'Kim played pretty well and his finishing was good but he let me in when he missed that 100. It was nip and tuck so I'm happy to have come out with the win.

'It was a tough game but I enjoyed it. I had a 104 average this week and won and a 115 average last week and lost, which doesn't make sense, but that's the game now and there were a lot of nerves on this week.

'I can relax next week now but I'm really looking forward to playing Dave Chisnall in Manchester.'

World champion Gary Anderson was also a winner in Dublin as he saw off Stephen Bunting 7-4 while James Wade beat Peter Wright 7-3.
