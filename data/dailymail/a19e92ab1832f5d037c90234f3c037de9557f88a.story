Pledging beforehand not to whine - because kids whine - competitors took on electric shocks, ice baths and plenty of mud in a knew craze sweeping the nation.

Following success across the pond people have been fighting to sign up for this gruelling 12-mile obstacle course as it made its way to the UK for the first time this year.

Designed by Special Forces burly men and women, working in teams, took on the Tough Mudder event at the Cholmondeley Estate in Cholmondeley, Cheshire.

It is the third event of its kind on these shores following success at events in May in the South East and Midlands and later in July in Scotland.

Billed as the ultimate test of strength, stamina, determination and camaraderie, people brave enough to sign up to the event make their way though a host of eye-watering obstacles.

From an ice bath labelled the 'Arctic Enema' to 'Kiss of Mud 2' and the 'Electroshock Therapy' the course is certainly not for the faint-hearted.

Suit-ably difficult: With prizes for best and worst costumes many entrants dress up to trawl through miles of mud

But Tough Mudders are certainly warned about what to expect beforehand, as they are led through a pledge.

Not only do they have to vow not to whine - because kids whine - but they must promise to overcome all fears, put teamwork and camaraderie before a course time and understand that Tough Mudder is not a race but a challenge.

And challanged they are, as these pictures show, with many of them needing a helping hand to cross the finish line.

But it is not all pain and dirt, with plenty of other unusual elements to the bizarre event.

With prizes for best and worst costumes, least clothing and 'most likely to have been in the Village People' there were plenty of wacky fancy dress attempts.

And it was not just attire that turned the eye.

With free head-shaves available on site there were also prizes dished out for toughest mullet and toughest mohawk - while anyone bearing a Tough Mudder tattoo was also in for an award.

So if you love nothing more than trawling through mud, ice baths and taking on the odd electric shock while dressed like a head shaven Santa Claus, fear not.

Because the next Tough Mudder is just around the corner, with six more events planned in the UK for next year.

First port of call will be Northampton in May, before tours in London South, Scotland, Yorkshire, the South West and North West before the end of the year.

Tough love: Part of the ethos of the Tough Mudder is to help others through the course when it all gets a bit too much
