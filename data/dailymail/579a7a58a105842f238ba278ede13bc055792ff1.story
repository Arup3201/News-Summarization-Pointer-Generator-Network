On Monday afternoon, 33-year-old Lakeisha Brooks was in the check-out line of a Rouses grocery store in Houma, Louisiana, waiting to pay for some milk and cereal when the unthinkable happened: a bright flash, a loud crash - Brooks had been struck by lightning while standing inside a grocery store.

'I felt like a breeze and then the pain came,' she tells HoumaToday.com.

The blast had blown Brooks' shoe clean off her foot. Shocked, she hopped away to the other side of the store. When she looked back, she saw it strike the floor again in the exact same spot where she had just been struck.

'A man there kept saying, "you never see lightning strike the same place twice." Well, it did,' she says.

Brooks described the bizarre strike as feeling like hot oil running down her thigh, 'like when you're cooking, that pop,' she says.

Gavin Phillips, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service, says he can't remember a time when a person has been struck by lightning while INSIDE a building. But local authorities believe  the lightning traveled through the store's sprinkler system before it struck a metal plate on
 the floor, and ultimately striking Brooks.

Brooks, a 33-year-old mother of four who works in the cafeteria at a local junior high school, suffered burns to her left leg and right foot. She was taken to Terrebonne General Medical Center, where she was treated and released.

Brooks says she's lucky to be alive.

'First thing I said when I sat down was God is good,' she says.

Brooks says she usually stays in doors during thunderstorms, but now thinks even that might not be enough.

'Just knowing it could happen inside a grocery store,' she says, 'it could happen anywhere.'
