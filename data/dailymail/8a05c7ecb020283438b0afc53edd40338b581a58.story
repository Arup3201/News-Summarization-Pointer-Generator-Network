Fans of legendary Up Pompeii! star Frankie Howerd can snap up personal items from the comedian's huge collection of memorabilia including his passport - complete with his awful toupee photo.

Among the other lots set for auction next week are some of his school reports, which reveal 'a marked talent in dramatics' - and his first contract of employment as a filing clerk, for which he received £1 a week.

Camp comic Frankie became a national treasure in the early 1970s when millions tuned in to watch him play lecherous slave Lurcio, in the hit BBC sitcom set in ancient Rome.

Frankie's catchphrases 'Oooh Er, Missus; Titter Ye Not; and Nay, Nay and Thrice Nay,' won him millions of fans.

Another item going under the hammer is Frankie's first ever contract of employment - as a junior filing clerk with Henry A Lane & Co in Tooley Street, London, in 1935 on the princely wage of £1 a week

He was a regular at the Royal Variety Performance and was awarded an OBE in 1977.

Now Frankie's well-thumbed passport, photos of him with Elizabeth Taylor and Elton John, old school reports and his first contract of employment are to go under the hammer.

Titter ye not! Comedy fans will smirk at Frankie's hairpiece in the passport photo taken in 1967 - two years before he made his big TV breakthrough.

The dog-eared passport reveals Frankie was an impressive globe-trotter with stamps ranging from his favourite holiday villa in Malta, to New York, Boston, Toronto, Australia, Brazil, Kenya, Fiji, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok, Antigua and Budapest.

Collectors can bid for an original script signed by Frankie for the second episode of Up Pompeii! which he rehearsed at the Sulgrave Boys' Club, near the BBC's Shepherd's Bush studios.

In a school report from 1930, his form master comments that he was a 'capable boy who will doubtless get higher in his form. Has shown a promising interest in dramatic work'

Headmaster Mr R Affleck said: 'His school career was free of any blemish whatever and towards the end distinguished by success in his examinations and by the revelation of a marked talent in dramatics'

His acting prowess did not go unnoticed by staff at Woolwich County School

Frankie, whose career took off with the West End musical A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum in 1963, died from heart failure aged 75 in 1992.

The collection - being auctioned following the sale of Wavering Down, his Somerset country home - is to be sold by Dreweatts in Bristol on February 26.

Dreweatts' auctioneer Peter Rixon said: 'Frankie Howerd was a true national treasure who was acknowledged as the master of the double entendre and risque gags.

Among the lots is this pencil drawing of Frankie Howerd by an unknown artist

'This sale will probably be the last chance for collectors to bid for some of Frankie's remaining personal belongings which give a fascinating insight into his life from his school days right to the height of his success.

'We've got some wonderful photographs of Frankie with Elizabeth Taylor and Elton John, pictures of him at the Theatre of Dionysus ruins in Athens and others with members of the Royal Family including The Queen, Prince Philip, Princess Margaret and the Queen Mother.

'Frankie served as a gunner in the 
Royal Artillery in the Second World War and we've got a passport-style 
strip of three photographs of him wearing Army uniform.

'We've
 already had a lot of interest and we are planning to sell the items in 
three combined lots with a conservative estimate of £700 to £800.'

Another master, WH Brodie, recorded 
Frankie was a 'school prefect', adding he was 'a clever actor. who pays 
attention to his elocution'.
