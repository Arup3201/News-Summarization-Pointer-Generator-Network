Officers have paid an emotional tribute to police dog that was stabbed to death by a convicted sex offender he was helping to arrest.

Several police staff saluted the flag-covered casket containing the body of Rocco, an eight-year-old German Shepherd who was fatally wounded while officers attempted to arrest John Rush in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia on Tuesday evening.

Rocco fought for his life for two days following the stabbing, before eventually succumbing to blood loss and pneumonia last night, with the Mayor of Pittsburgh ordering all flags in the city to be flown at half-mast as the news broke.

Final farewell: Officers pay an emotional tribute to police dog Rocco, who was stabbed to death by a criminal he was helping to arrest. The Mayor of Pittsburgh has ordered all flags in the city to be flown at half-mast

Rocco was said to have fought 'a good fight' in the days after his stabbing, and his condition was initially thought to be improving, but as he deteriorated over the course of yesterday afternoon, officers arrived at the Pittsburgh Veterinary Specialty & Emergency Center to say their last goodbyes.

'He fought as hard here as he did out on the field,' staff surgeon Julie Compton told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

As it became clear Rocco would not last the night, police canine units from across the city made a slow process towards the clinic, flashing their lights in tribute to their dying colleague.

One retired police dog handler played a bagpipe salute as Rocco's death was announced, while serving officers standing with their dogs in the street outside the clinic presented arms.

Rocco was reportedly stabbed by a convicted sex offender as officers attempted to arrest him

Rocco was reportedly stabbed by 21-year-old convicted sex offender John Rush as officers attempted to arrest him on Tuesday afternoon.

Rocco and his handler, Officer Phil Lerza, had been called to the scene after reports that homeless Rush was behaving suspiciously outside a basement entrance to a building on Butler Street in Pittsburgh's Lawrenceville neighbourhood.

When Officer Lerza asked for the man's name and identification, Rush is said to have lunged for the officer's gun and then punched him in the face before running off.

Officer Lerza attempted to stop Rush escaping by using a Taser, but he made off into a basement home in 3700 Block on Butler Street.

As Rocco,his handler and three other officers made their way into the building, Rush allegedly jumped out from behind a pillar wielding a knife.

Rush is said to have lunged at the group, swinging the knife as Rocco bravely bit onto his arm in an attempt to bring him under control.

During the struggle, Officer Daniel Novak and Officer John Baker were punched several times in the head, while Officer Lanza suffered a non-serious puncture wound to his back, and a fourth officer suffered a knee injury.

But it was Rocco who bore the brunt of Rush's alleged rampage, suffering a three-inch stab wound to his side that penetrated muscle and a kidney, and caused extensive blood loss.

Rush now faces felony charges of abusing a police animal, disarming a law enforcement officer, aggravated assault, burglary and misdemeanor charges of animal cruelty, resisting arrest and possessing instruments of a crime. He is being held without bond in the Allegheny County Jail.

A police spokesperson said dogs serving in the Pittsburgh police force are provided with protective vests, but they are not always deemed practical dogs wearing them can easily overheat.

They also take several minutes to put on, so when a situation rapidly and unexpectedly escalates, as in the arrest of Rush, there is not always time to use one.
