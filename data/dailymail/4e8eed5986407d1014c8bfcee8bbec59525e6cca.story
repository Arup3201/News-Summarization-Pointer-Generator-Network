Police are investigating the rape of two female students and a serious sex assault of a third at the prestigious Royal Agricultural University.

Three male students have been arrested in connection with the alleged attacks on the night of a summer ball to mark end-of-year exams.

A university source told The Mail on Sunday that the alleged attacks took place at a private property in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, after the group had spent the night celebrating at the May Ball.

The three victims were aged 19, 20 and 21. The university confirmed that three male students have been suspended.

A university source, who did not want to be named, said: ‘The ball was, as usual, a riotous occasion, with everyone throwing a considerable amount of alcohol down their throats.We’ve got 1,200 students here and a good many of them were at the ball, as well as quite  a few ex-students and staff. There’s never any trouble normally, beyond people letting their hair down and having a good time.

‘We are all extremely shocked by what has happened.’

The internationally renowned university, which until 2013 was known as the Royal Agricultural College, is rated the Oxbridge of agricultural studies and is often attended by the sons and daughters of wealthy and titled landed gentry.

The ball was hosted by the university’s student union, which describes the annual event on its website as ‘the biggest ball of the year and the main event in the social diary’.

It adds: ‘With live bands and top DJs, a funfair and partying from dusk ’til dawn.’

A police spokesperson said: ‘Three students from the Royal Agricultural University were arrested on Sunday May 25 in Cirencester in connection with an investigation into alleged sexual assaults. They have been bailed respectively until July 29, 30 and 31 to return to a police station as part of the investigation.’

The Royal Agricultural University, founded in 1845, is ranked by the influential Complete University Guide as the fifth safest in the UK.

It was the first agricultural college in the English-speaking world. Former students include political commentator Jonathan Dimbleby, Princess Anne’s ex-husband Captain Mark Phillips, the late champion horse trainer Sir Henry Cecil and racehorse trainers Nicky Henderson and Andrew Balding, who is the brother of TV and radio presenter Clare.

The university provides more than 30 land-based undergraduate and postgraduate degree courses for students from almost 50 countries worldwide and is, according to the Complete University Guide, often described as ‘the Oxbridge of the countryside’.

On the Royal Agricultural University website, ex-student union chairman Nick Pain is quoted as follows: ‘The Student Union motto is Work Hard, Play Hard!, and Ciren students certainly live up to the hype!’

The historic university’s main quadrangle sits alongside a 16th Century tithe barn and farmhouse, in 25 acres of manicured grounds. The university operates two farms in the area.

Students can study a range of courses rooted in agriculture, business, food production and equine management to Masters degree level.

The university motto is ‘Avorum Cultus Pecorumque’, meaning ‘Caring for the fields and the beasts’.

Since 2008, the university has seen a 49 per cent rise in applications and is ranked top in the UK for investing in campus facilities.
