A German nurse has expressed regret for killing up to 30 patients by giving them an overdose of heart medication.

Nils H, 38, reportedly told Oldenburg regional court he brought about cardiac arrests in some 90 patients because he enjoyed the feeling of being able to resuscitate them. 

H, whose full name is withheld under German privacy laws, used Gilurytmal, a medication which should only be used by doctors under strict supervision, it was said. He claimed 30 of these patients died.

Though H is facing charges in three murders and two attempted murders, the state prosecutor has said he could be involved in more than 150 deaths.

Prosecutors in the district court of Oldenburg said he was bored and wanted to practice his 'excellent' resuscitation skills. They are seeking a life-sentence for the defendant. 

According to the prosecution, if the first attempt at resuscitation was a success, H. would sometimes make a second attempt. 

Side effects include an irregular heartbeat, a drop in blood pressure and uncoordinated functioning of the heart muscle. 

In cooperation with the police, the state prosecutor is currently investigating the deaths of 174 patients who died during H's shifts from 2003 to 2005 at a clinic in Delmenhorst, near Bremen.

The investigators will also look into deaths at H.'s previous jobs in Oldenburg and Wilhelmshaven and dozens of bodies will have to be exhumed.

In 2008, Nils H was previously sentenced to seven-and-a-half years for the attempted murder of another patient. 

He gave his patient an overdose of heart medication, though the man narrowly escaped death.

The death rate in the Delmenhorst clinic nearly doubled in the time H. worked there, and use of the heart medication also increased dramatically.

But it took nearly a decade before an investigation was launched, angering relatives of the dead who are demanding information.

A senior doctor who gave evidence in September said H was a 'passionate medic' who made a good impression on staff at the clinic.

But the doctor added: 'I found it strange that he was always on hand when patients were being resuscitated, often helping younger doctors with intubation - inserting a breathing tube into a patient's airways.'

'No one wants to believe that a colleague would rather kill patients, instead of helping them,' said Erich Joester, a lawyer for the clinic.

He said that the increased death rate had been attributed to a number of causes rather than a rogue individual.
