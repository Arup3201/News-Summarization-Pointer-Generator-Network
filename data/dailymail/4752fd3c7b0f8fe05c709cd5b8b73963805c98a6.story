While the return of the Premier League this weekend will see debuts from exciting deadline-day signings, there's also room to celebrate loyal servants at clubs.

Ryan Giggs' retirement at the end of last season brought an end to a glittering career for the Manchester United winger, but it also ensured his baton of longest-serving Premier League player needed to be passed on.

Taking the Welshman's place as the top flight's longest-serving player is Steven Gerrard, with the Liverpool captain's debut coming as far back as November 1998 when the midfielder replaced Vegard Heggem with a minute to be played in the Reds' 2-0 home win over Blackburn.

Not far behind Gerrard is John Terry, with the Chelsea captain making his Premier League debut a month later on Boxing Day.

The former England skipper was also a second-half substitute, replacing Gus Poyet in Chelsea's 2-0 win at Southampton.

Few of the remaining top-flight sides have players who have spent over 10 years at the elite level, but with the transfer window now shut and the squads settled, Sportsmail has looked at the longest serving players at Premier League every club.

Arsenal - Abou Diaby (Debut for current club - 21/1/2006)

He's only managed 124 appearances in eight-and-a-half years, but Abou Diaby takes the crown as Arsenal's longest serving player.

The midfielder, who signed from Auxerre in January 2006, made his debut as substitute in a 1-0 defeat to Everton in the same month and is currently fighting to get back into Arsene Wenger's first team.

Aston Villa - Gabriel Agbonlahor (18/3/2006)

There won't be many Aston Villa fans too keen to remember Gabriel Agbonlahor's debut, but the Villa striker at least has a reason to smile about it as he scored in the club's 4-1 defeat by Everton.

Burnley - Michael Duff (20/12/2009)

Michael Duff made his Premier League debut in 2009, but first featured for Burnley in August 2004 in a 1-1 Championship draw with Sheffield United. The 36-year-old signed for just £30,000 from Cheltenham Town.

Chelsea - John Terry (07/08/2004)

Now known as 'captain, leader, legend', it was small steps to start with for John Terry who was thrown into the Premier League spotlight on Boxing Day in 1998 as a substitute during the Blues 2-0 win at Southampton.

Crystal Palace - Julian Speroni (14/8/2004)

Not many would have backed Julian Speroni to have lasted over 10 years at Crystal Palace after a shaky first season, but the goalkeeper has turned into a fan favourite over the years,

Everton - Tony Hibbert (31/3/2001)

A product of the Toffees' academy, Tony Hibbert began his senior Everton career way back in 2001 under then manager Walter Smith.

The tough-tackling right back has since gone on to earn a testimonial and signed a new two-year contract earlier this summer.

Hull - Paul McShane (13/09/2008)

Paul McShane made a winning start for Hull in a 2-1 win at Newcastle, and despite suffering relegation with the Tigers has since helped the club back into the top flight.

Andy King (left) came through Leicester's academy in 2007, while Paul McShane joined Hull a year later

Leicester - Andy King (02/10/2007)

It's not hard to be Leicester's longest-serving Premier League player given this is their first season back in the top flight for 10 years, but King made his club debut against Wolves in an October 2007 Championship clash after coming through the academy.

Liverpool - Steven Gerrard (29/11/1998)

Get out your record books and make a note because Steven Gerrard's small cameo a minute from time in a 2-0 win over Blackburn makes him officially the Premier League's longest-serving player.

Steven Gerrard has been in the Liverpool team since 1998, while Micah Richards made his City debut in 2005

Manchester City - Micah Richards (22/10/2005)

Micah Richards burst onto the scene in 2005 after working his way up Manchester City's youth academy.

His debut came against Arsenak in October 2005 but he has recently joined Italian side Fiorentina on loan after finding first team opportunities hard to come by.

Manchester United - Darren Fletcher (27/09/2003)

Darren Fletcher already had Champions League experience when he made his Premier League debut, which came in a 4-1 win at Leicester, with Ruud van Nistelrooy grabbing a hat-trick for the Red Devils.

Newcastle - Steven Taylor (28/03/2004)

Steven Taylor's debut in the Newcastle defence was just four minutes long when Bolton's Henrik Pederson scored the winning goal, but the centre-half has since proven his worth by going on to make 196 league appearances for the Toon.

QPR - Alejandro Faurlin (18/08/2009)

Currently ruled out with another serious knee injury, Alejandro Faurlin became QPR's club record signing when he moved to Loftus Road for £3.5million in July 2009.

The talented midfielder has played for the Hoops 121 times since but his career hit by a number of serious knee problems in recent years.

Southampton - Kelvin Davis (06/08/2006)

Signed from Sunderland in 2006, Kelvin Davis enjoyed a prolonged spell in the Southampton first team but is now third choice behind Fraser Forster and Artur Boruc.

The veteran goalkeeper made his debut in August 2006 and has gone on to play for Saints on another 261 occasions.

Stoke - Andy Wilkinson (16/10/2001)

After coming through Stoke's academy system Andy Wilkinson made his debut for the club while he was still a teenager way back in 2001.

Thirteen years later and he's still a member of the first team squad, having also spent time out on loan at Telford United, Partick Thistle, Shrewsbury Town and Blackpool.

Sunderland - Lee Cattermole (15/08/2009)

No Sunderland player can boast more than Lee Cattermole's five years at the club, with the midfielder playing in a 1-0 win at Bolton following a £6million move from Wigan.

Swansea - Alan Tate (07/02/2004)

Signed from Manchester United after two successful loan spells, Alan Tate has enjoyed over a decade at Swansea since arriving in 2004.

The defender has spent the last couple of years mostly out on loan, with stints at Leeds, Yeovil and, most recently, Aberdeen.

Tottenham - Aaron Lennon (27/08/2005)

The departure of Michael Dawson has left Aaron Lennon as Tottenham's longest-serving player having made his debut in a 2-0 home defeat by Chelsea in August 2005.

West Brom - James Morrison - (11/08/2007)

Along with James Morrison, Chris Brunt also made his Premier League debut for West Brom in a 1-0 loss at Arsenal, but Morrison made his first Baggies appearance a year earlier in a 2-1 Championship loss at Burnley.

West Ham - Mark Noble (13/08/2005) 

Mark Noble had already been in the West Ham team for a year when he made his Premier League debut, which came in a 3-1 Upton Park win over Blackburn.
