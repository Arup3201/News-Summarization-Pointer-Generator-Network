Olympian Jo Pavey has given birth to her second child, a daughter called Emily.

The distance runner Tweeted this morning: 'Very pleased to announce that baby Emily was born on Wednesday morning in Exeter. She is doing well and we're all really happy.'

Jo and her husband, Gavin - who is also her athletics coach - already have a son, Jacob, three.

New arrival: Jo Tweeted their happy news this morning

Female marathon world record holder, 
Paula Radcliffe, was among those to congratulate the couple on their new
arrival via Twitter.

Jo, from Devon, is a Commonwealth and European silver medallist over 5k and 10k respectively and has represented Great Britain at four Olympic Games (Sydney, Athens, Beijing and London).

Last year at the home games she was the first European in the 5k and 10k, finishing both races in 7th place and setting a personal best time in the 10k of 30.53. She had also achieved the qualifying time for the marathon after running a pb of 2.28 in New York in 2011.

Jo will turn 40 this month and when she announced she was expecting her second child, she said she had no intention of retiring from the international running scene. She hopes to return to form in time to compete in the European Championships in 2014 and then the Rio Olympics in 2016.

She said: 'It will be very special if I can make the Rio Games. I'll be getting older, but have been very encouraged to continue after running a pb in the 10k at the London Olympics.'

Jo continued to run throughout her pregnancy - at a much lower intensity than usual - and blogged about her progress.

She wrote: 'My volume has dropped from over 100 miles per week down to 20 or so miles per week. The pace I'm running at has significantly fallen too. I wear a heart rate monitor and keep below about 140 beats per minute. I'm not actually interested in running fast, it's about running a safe pace.'

She added that she always listened to her body and put her baby first - never running if she felt too tired.

She also said she kept 'very busy with conditioning work to help make the post pregnancy return to running go as smoothly as possible.'

Athletes are recommended to have at least six to eight weeks rest after giving birth before returning gradually to training.

With advice from top physios on hand and under the watchful eye of her husband, Jo said she will ease back into training sensibly to avoid injury and allow her to enjoy being a new mother again.

She said: 'My long career has probably been made possible by building my training very slowly and carefully but also because my coach sets schedules that closely correlate to the level of conditioning completed.'

She added: 'Some people have been surprised that I
have the motivation to want to continue running at international level 
but you are a long time retired and I simply love running. Ironically it
also gives me more time with my family as I essentially work from home.'

The Olympian said motherhood has increased her desire to do well in sport as well as lead a 'balanced' life.

She said: 'Having Jacob has boosted my motivation and underpins my continued enjoyment of the sport. He really has helped to give me a balanced life. When everything is very tense or serious you can count on a three year old to lighten things up!'
