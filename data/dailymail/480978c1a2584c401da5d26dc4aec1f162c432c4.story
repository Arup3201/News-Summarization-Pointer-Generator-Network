Ron Vlaar's penalty came within inches of crossing the line during Holland's heartbreaking shootout defeat against Argentina on Wednesday night.

The Aston Villa defender and Wesley Sneijder were both denied by Sergio Romero as the Dutch lost 4-2 on spot-kicks after the World Cup semi-final ended goalless.

However, Vlaar's opening kick almost left Romero red faced, who was too busy celebrating his save to notice the ball creeping back towards the goal.

Fortunately for the Argentina keeper, the ball stopped just short as his country went on to book a final showdown with Germany on Sunday and consign Holland to a third-place play-off.

FIFA's rules on penalty shootouts clear the matter up, stating: 'A kick is successful if, having been touched once by the kicker, the ball crosses the goal line between the goal posts and under the crossbar, without touching any player, official, or outside agent other than the defending goalkeeper.

'The ball may touch the goalkeeper, goal posts, or crossbar any number of times before going into the goal as long as the referee believes the ball's motion is the result of the initial kick.'

This was clarified after an incident in the 1986 World Cup shootout between Brazil and France. Bruno Bellone's spot-kick rebounded off the post and hit Brazilian goalkeeper Carlos before rolling into the net.

Louis van 
Gaal revealed two players had refused to take the first penalty as 
Vlaar's miss saw Holland get off to the worst possible start.

He said: 'You need to score the first one and I asked two players to take the first ball before ending up with Vlaar.

'I
 thought he was the best player on the pitch so should have a lot of 
confidence. It just goes to show it's not easy scoring in a penalty 
shoot-out.'
