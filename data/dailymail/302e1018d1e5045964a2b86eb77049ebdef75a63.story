A  mother is furious after a judge ordered her 13-year-old daughter to cut off her ponytail in return for a lesser sentence after she attacked a toddler with scissors and hacked off chunks of her hair. 

Kaytlen Lopan and an 11-year-old friend launched their assault on the three-year-old at a McDonald’s restaurant in Price, Utah, buying a pair of scissors from a nearby dollar shop and chopping off her long curly locks.

Kaytlen was ordered to serve 30 days in detention, pay damages to the victims and serve 276 hours of community service for her part in the attack, at a hearing on May 28.

But her mother, Valerie Bruno, took up a judge’s offer of reducing the sentence if she performed a similar hack job to her daughter’s hair.

District Juvenile Judge Scott Johansen said he would drop the number of hours by 150 in exchange for the amateur haircut, the Deseret News reported.

‘If she was my daughter, I wouldn't want her with the work crew,’ he said, to which Ms Bruno replied: ‘I know, I thought of that.’

Mr Johansen gave Ms Bruno a pair of scissors and consulted the victim’s mother, Mindy Moss, about what length the girl’s hair should be taken to, eventually ordering Ms Bruno to cut it level with the hairband tying it up. 

He even gave her advice on the cut, suggesting that Ms Bruno ‘take a little bit at a time’ when she complained that the scissors weren’t good enough.

Ms Moss said she was happy with the outcome, adding that her daughter’s hair had never been cut prior to the attack and had reached down to the middle of her back.

But Ms Bruno was furious and has 
since claimed to have filed a complaint against the judge, although that
has not been confirmed by the court.

'She
definitely needed to be punished for what had happened,' Ms Bruno told 
said. 'But I never dreamt it would be that much of a punishment.'

She added that she wishes she had never accepted the judge's bargaining offer. 

‘I
guess I should have went into the courtroom knowing my rights, because I
felt very intimidated,’ she said. ‘An eye for an eye, that's not how 
you teach kids right from wrong.'

The
11-year-old accused alongside Kaytlen was ordered by Mr Johansen to 
have her hair cut as short as his, but was allowed to get it done at a 
salon, rather than in the courtroom. 

‘It
was not really unattractive. They tried to make it decent, but there 
was really nothing left,’ he was heard saying in court, according to the
newspaper. 

Kaytlen also 
admitted to charges in another case regarding eight months of phone 
calls that she made to a Colorado teen, threatening rape and mutilation.
