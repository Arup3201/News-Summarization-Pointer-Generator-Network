A motorist has won a court battle against a parking firm who tried to fine him £100 for circling a car park - without stopping.

Dave Hotchin, 49, spent half an hour waiting for a space without success before driving away from Fistral Beach car park in Newquay, Cornwall.

Two months later shocked Mr Hotchin received a demand for £100 saying the couple had been caught without a ticket by an automatic number plate reader.

Dave Hotchin, 49, spent half an hour waiting for a space without success at a car park at Fistral beach in Newquay, Cornwall (pictured) before driving off. He was later sent a £100 fine but has now won a court battle against the car park operators

After sending four further warnings to Mr Hotchin and his wife bosses at car park firm Parking Eye launched a court action to get the money.

But a judge threw out the claim because the 31 minutes the pair from Altrincham, Greater Manchester, spent driving around the car park in May last year did not classify as 'parking'.

He said: 'We were very surprised. We thought it was unfair considering we’d never even parked up. We were just circling the car park looking for a space.

'My wife didn’t want to go to court and found it all very intimidating but at this stage it wasn’t really about the money. We felt like we were being bullied if anything.

'The most vulnerable people in society just pay up but we decided to stick it out because we felt we had a good case.'

A spokeswoman for Parking Eye said the company 'wins the majority of legal actions it brings against car park users'.
