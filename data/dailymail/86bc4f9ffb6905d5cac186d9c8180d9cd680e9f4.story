Chelsea completed a £27million deal for Juan Cuadrado on transfer deadline day in a move that sat Andre Schurrle head back to Germany and Wolfsburg. 

Fiorentina star Cuadrado, 26, will cost the Blues an initial £23.3million which will rise to £26.8m with bonuses. 

Here's 10 things you need to know about Jose Mourinho's new recruit.

1. Watch out Willian

The first question on Chelsea fans' minds will be where will Cuadrado fit into the team?

Realistically, the Colombian has quite a fight on his hands given the way Mourinho's side have been performing this season. After all, they are five points clear in the Premier League and reached the final of the Capital One Cup after beating Liverpool on Tuesday night.

Mourinho has a well-established and highly-effective 4-2-3-1 system and Cuadrado is most likely to feature on the right-hand side of the trident that plays behind Diego Costa.

So it's Willian that is looking over his shoulder with alarm. The Brazilian has featured in 31 matches for Chelsea this season, scoring three times and contributing three assists.

It's not a spectacular record and Mourinho won't be shy in pairing his new signing with the much more in-form Oscar and Eden Hazard.

2. Pace to burn

The first thing Chelsea fans will notice is the raw pace Cuadrado has to offer. He will rampage down that right side, leaving defenders for dead with his speed, trickery and athleticism.

Even if he starts on the bench against City (assuming all the paperwork can be completed in time), Cuadrado will generate quite a buzz of excitement around Stamford Bridge when he first collects the ball and zooms off.

He was given the nickname 'Vespa' by his former Fiorentina team-mate Luca Toni in reference to the ubiquitous scooters that nip in and out of the traffic on Italian city streets.

Cuadrado likes to do the same with defenders, nimbly weaving in between them with his close control.

3. And work rate to match

You always got the impression Mourinho demanded a little bit more from Schurrle in terms of work rate, including the all-important tracking back when Chelsea attacks broke down.

While Cuadrado's primary purpose will be to carry Chelsea forward, he does muck in with the defensive work too and that will be appreciated by Branislav Ivanovic, manager and fans alike.

4. What about his scoring record?

As with all Chelsea's creative players, Cuadrado will be expected to chip in with a few goals as well.

It's a part of his game that the winger has worked hard on and his scoring rates have improved with every season in Italy.

Speaking in 2013, Cuadrado revealed how he'd worked hard at improving this aspect of his game.

'I spend hours and hours shooting at goal after training,' he said. 'Who knows how angry the goalkeepers Neto and (Cristiano) Lupatelli are at having to hang back with me before they're able to hit the showers.'

Cuadrado moved to Udinese from Independiente Medellin, one of the leading clubs in his homeland, in 2010.

During his youth career, he was actually a striker but didn't really have a good enough scoring record and so the coaches thought his electric pace would be better utilised out wide.

He failed to find the net in his two seasons with Udinese before a season-long loan to Lecce in 2011-12 kick-started his career.

There, he scored three goals in 33 matches to get the ball rolling and since moving to Fiorentina, Cuadrado has scored 26 times in 106 outings.

5. What about setting up goals for others?

Again, this is an area that has improved with age for Cuadrado, whose crossing and passing in the final third has become more assured and incisive.

At the World Cup last summer, Cuadrado finished joint-top of the tournament's assist chart with Germany's Toni Kroos on four apiece. Kroos, however, played in two matches more.

Two of Cuadrado's came as Greece were swept aside 3-0 in Colombia's opening group match and he also scored a penalty in the third group game, a 4-1 win over Japan.

And in the last-16 clash with Uruguay, after Rodriguez had scored his award-winning volley, Cuadrado soared into the air to cushion a very high cross down for the top scorer to grab a crucial second.

For Fiorentina, he registered 11 assists last season and has three so far this term.

6. He knows how to celebrate in style

Most people will remember Cuadrado from the vibrant Colombia side that reached the quarter-finals of the World Cup last year.

Though James Rodriguez was the undoubted star in Jose Pekerman's team, Cuadrado played an integral part as his assist record testifies.

The Colombian celebrations also stick in the memory - those colourful, choreographed dance routines that even involved the substitutes on the touchline. 

Perhaps we'll see Chelsea inventing their own signature moves soon.

7. He's a tough cookie

One of the things Mourinho and Chelsea fans need to be reassured about is whether Cuadrado can cope with the robust and physical nature of the English game.

The evidence so far suggests that he's pretty resilient. Cuadrado has consistently been one of the most fouled players in Serie A, unsurprising given that defenders don't take too kindly to being made to look like fools.

But his athleticism means he can withstand most challenges and his injury history is very encouraging. He missed five games for Fiorentina in September 2013 but that's about it.

8. His early years were far from easy

Cuadrado was born in the coastal town of Necocli, which is one of the oldest settlements in Colombia, though he was raised further south in the city of Tumaco.

His father, Guillermo, a truck driver, was shot dead when he was just five years old. Speaking on a Colombian interview show, his mother Marcela said he had to be the perfect student in order to play football.

Playing as a forward, Cuadrado started out at Atletico Uraba but on the recommendation of the club's founder Nelson Gallego, he was moved to the wing.

After a brief spell at second division side Rionegro, where he mostly languished on the bench, he was signed by Independiente Medellin, one of the country's biggest clubs, in 2008.

Cuadrado scored on his debut against Boyaca Chico and the wheels were soon in motion.

9. Italian jobs

Cuadrado only actually spent one season at Independiente. He attracted interest from Italian clubs and joined Udinese on a five-year contract in July 2009.

Opportunities were initially limited for the then-21-year-old, who made just 12 appearances in his first season and the same number in his second, failing to score a goal in either.

A change of scenery was probably a good idea and he was sent out to fellow Serie A side Lecce for the 2011-12 campaign.

With more regular football, Cuadrado started to show his talents, scoring three goals and setting up two more in a season of 33 league appearances.

It wasn't enough to keep Lecce in the top flight but his performances did catch the eye of Fiorentina. They paid £4.5m for a 50 per cent ownership stake in Cuadrado.

In his first season at the Stadio Artemio Franchi, he opened his account in a 4-1 win over Cagliari and finished the season with five goals and seven assists as the Viola finished fourth.

But 2013-14 was his breakthrough season, with a string of impressive performances leading to 15 goals and 11 assists in all competitions.

The most important came against his former club Udinese in the semi-final, second leg of the Coppa Italia, securing a 3-2 aggregate success and a place in the final against Napoli (which they lost 3-1).

The winger became a popular figure at Lecce for his dance celebrations with team-mate Luis Muriel 

10. International honours

Cuadrado earned his first international call-up for Colombia a year after his transfer to Udinese, playing and scoring against Venezuela in September 2010.

Since then, he has been a regular in the side, with 37 caps and five goals to his name.
