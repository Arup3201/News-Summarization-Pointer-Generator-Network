Hero: Captain Craig Moreau (pictured with his wife) doused a truck fire with beer

A Houston firefighter is being lauded after he doused a
truck fire with beer.

Captain Craig Moreau was off-duty returning from a weekend
trip to Austin when he saw the burning 18-wheel truck on the side of a highway
Monday and sprang into action to put out the blaze.

He initially tried to douse the fire with a small
extinguisher, but that proved insufficient. That’s when he was forced to turn
to the truck’s cargo – Coors Banquet Beer.

‘I crawled underneath and thought we'd got it out but it
flared back up,’ Mr Moreau told the Houston Chronicle. ‘So I said to the
driver, 'what have you got in here?’

The driver told him the truck was hauling a load of beer.
The pair soon started shaking and spraying cans of Rocky Mountain refreshment
at the flames even as one of the tires exploded.

The beer finally helped quell the fire, the truck was saved.

‘I have no doubt if the beer hadn't been there, the whole
trailer would have burned up,’ Mr Moreau recalled. ‘A few more minutes down the
road and it may not have worked.’

The semi’s brakes had just been fixed, Mr Morneau remembered
the driver telling him. He also said this was a unique experience.

Empties: Mr Moreau and the driver left behind a collection of empty beer cans after dousing the blaze

‘It's in our nature to help folks, but this is the first
time I've done it with beer,’ he told the paper.

He later commented on his Facebook page that he didn’t snag
a 12-pack for himself.

‘I like dark beer.’
