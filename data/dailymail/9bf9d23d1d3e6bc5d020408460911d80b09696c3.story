In the summer of 1989 Nasa’s Voyager 2 became the first, and to date only, spacecraft to visit the planet Neptune.

During the brief flyby of the planet on 25 August, the probe returned images of its natural satellite Triton, a giant moon bigger even than the dwarf planet Pluto.

And now a map and video have been revealed stitching together the images in unprecedented detail, creating the most comprehensview of its surface ever seen.

Footage of Voyager 2's flyby of Neptune's largest moon (animation above) has been restored by Dr Paul Schenk of the Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI). The movie, using the best Voyager map in colour, recreates the encounter with Triton as Voyager 2 ended its tour of the giant planets and began its trek into deep space in 1989

The footage was restored by Dr Paul Schenk of the Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI) in Houston, Texas.

It
 is 37 years since the twin Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft were launched and
 the pair continue to explore where nothing from Earth has flown before.

Their primary mission was the exploration of Jupiter and Saturn.

After
 making a string of discoveries there - such as active volcanoes on 
Jupiter's moon Io and intricacies of Saturn's rings - the mission was 
extended.

Voyager 2 went on to explore Uranus and Neptune, and is still the only spacecraft to have visited those outer planets.

The
 current mission for both spacecraft, the Voyager Interstellar Mission, 
is to explore the outermost edge of the Sun's domain and beyond. 

The map has a resolution of 1,970 feet (600 m) per pixel, while the approximately natural colours have been enhanced to bring out the contrast.

Voyager 2's ‘eyes’ saw colours slightly different from human eyes, and this map was produced using orange, green and blue filter images.

When it passed in 1989, most of the Northern Hemisphere was in darkness and was unseen.

Because of the speed of Voyager's visit - about 15 miles (25 km) per second, and the slow rotation of Triton - only the Southern Hemisphere was seen clearly at close distance.

The rest of the surface was either in darkness or seen as blurry markings.

'The biggest challenge in "restoring" this map was the color of Triton,' Dr Schenk tells MailOnline.

'We had considerable difficulty because some of the colour images were smeared or noisy, and there is some uncertainty in the absolute calibration of the colour images. 

'We also do not know exactly what the colour of Triton was in those days.  Earth-based observations gave very different answers. 

'We did our best to give at least an impression of what the colour of this very active body at the edge of the Solar System looks like.'

And on his website Dr Schenk explains what is being seen in the video and images.

‘Voyager 2 made a hair-raising pass over Neptune’s large moon Triton in August 1989,’ he wrote.

‘Approaching from the deep south, Voyager passed over the north pole of cloud-swept Neptune, almost close enough to brush the far-attenuated upper atmosphere.

‘The gravity of Neptune pulled the spacecraft down toward Triton, passing over the unlit north pole of that bitterly cold icy moon.’

When Voyager 2 passed in 1989, most of the Northern Hemisphere (left) was in darkness and was unseen. Because of the speed of Voyager's visit, about 15 miles (25 km) per second, and the slow rotation of Triton, only the Southern Hemisphere (right) was seen clearly at close distance

Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft ever to have visited Neptune, seen here. Dark, cold and whipped by supersonic winds, Neptune is the last of the hydrogen and helium gas giants in the solar system. More than 30 times as far from the sun as Earth, the planet takes almost 165 Earth years to orbit the sun

Triton is 1,681 miles (2,706 km) across, making it the 16th largest body in the solar system.

It is also thought to have an icy surface, and may even have clouds in its skies.

In fact, the moon is thought to bear some similarities to Pluto, which makes these recent restorations all the more interesting.

Next year on 14 July, Nasa’s New Horizons probe will flyby the dwarf planet, and by using the experiences of Voyager 2 at Triton, engineers hope to get as much data as possible out of the mission.

'The new map of Triton sharpens the details
 a bit but also shows us the entire surface, at least as far as Voyager 
could see it,' Dr Schenk continues to MailOnline.

'It gives us a sense of how dynamic and active this place 
is. More importantly we can compare it with other active worlds like 
Europa and Enceladus. 

'Perhaps the most important feature of the map is
 that it gives us a complete and up-to-date picture of Pluto, her twin,
 so that we will be ready when New Horizons gets there next summer.'

And on whether he hope a mission visits again in the future, he added: 'I
 certainly hope we go back.

'Uranus and Neptune and their strange moons 
are among the largest bodies on the Solar System.

'After we go back to 
Europa, the next targets should be Uranus, Neptune or both, with modern 
scientific instruments like Cassini at Saturn has.'

In another historic milestone for the 
Voyager mission, 25 August also marks the two-year anniversary of 
Voyager 1 reaching interstellar space.
