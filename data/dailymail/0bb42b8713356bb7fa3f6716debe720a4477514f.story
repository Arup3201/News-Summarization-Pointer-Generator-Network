Stephen Crabb has become the first Conservative cabinet minister with a beard for more than a century after being promoted to Welsh Secretary.

A bearded Tory has not sat at the cabinet table since William Hillier Onslow, the 4th Earl of Onslow, who was president of the board of agriculture from 1903 to 1905.

Mr Crabb, who is the MP for Preseli Prembrokeshire and was first elected in 2005, has neatly trimmed facial hair, which is in contrast to Lord Onslow’s fuller whiskers.

Stephen Crabb's promotion to Welsh Secretary makes him the first hirsute man in Cabinet since William Hillier Onslow, the 4th Earl of Onslow

William Hillier Onslow, the 4th Earl of Onslow, held several governmental positions between 1880 and 1905 and was also Governor of New Zealand between 1889 and 1892

The 41-year-old replaces David Jones who was sacked in the reshuffle. Mr Crabb had been his deputy at the Wales Office and was previously a government whip.

The father-of-two was raised by a single parent in a council house. Before election, he worked as a marketing consultant.

As he emerged from No 10 Downing Street yesterday he said he was ‘very pleased’ with his new job but ducked a question about how it felt to be the first Tory cabinet minister with a beard for more than 100 years.

The Beard Liberation Front, which campaigned against New Labour politicians removing their facial hair in a bid to boost their image, welcomed his appointment. Organiser Keith Flett said: ‘A beard in the cabinet is long overdue.’

The Tory party has previously been accused of pognophobia. Margaret Thatcher reportedly said she ‘wouldn’t tolerate any minister of mine wearing a beard’.

The last prime minister with a beard was Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, the 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, who resigned in 1902.

Labour has had several bearded Cabinet ministers in recent years, including David Blunkett (left) and Frank Dobson who both served under Tony Blair

There have been many bearded Cabinet ministers in the Labour party including Robin Cook, Charles Clarke and David Blunkett. But Alistair Darling shaved off his beard reportedly on the advice of image consultants.

Last year Jeremy Paxman prompted a debate on beards after he returned from a holiday to present Newsnight with a beard.  

Mr Crabb was welcomed to his new role by Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones, who described him as ‘pragmatic and reasonable’.

Andrew RT Davies, the Tory leader in the Welsh Assembly, said: 'Stephen Crabb has been an effective and hardworking minister and will be a powerful advocate for Wales around the Cabinet table.

'I congratulate my close colleague Stephen Crabb on his promotion.'

Shortly after his appointment Mr Crabb paid tribute to his predecessor. He tweeted: ‘I will build on the excellent work of David Jones.

‘He achieved so much during his time as Welsh secretary & leaves a strong legacy to Wales.’

In further tweets, he added: ‘Wales deserves the best and I look forward to providing a strong voice for Wales around the Cabinet table.

‘This Gov is ambitious for Wales, working to ensure Wales at front of the economic recovery.’
