Diego Costa will miss Tuesday's Champions League clash with NK Maribor at Stamford Bridge revealed Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho. 

Costa was absent from the Chelsea squad that beat Crystal Palace 2-1 on Saturday and will remain on the treatment table for a while longer.

The former Atletico Madrid forward apparently picked up the injury on international duty with Spain and Mourinho made a thinly-veiled dig at the Spanish international set-up after losing his star striker to injury.

Diego Costa scored his first international goal for Spain against Luxembourg during the week 

'After Arsenal he went to the national team, played two big matches and has come back in a condition where he can't play,' said Mourinho.

'I think he'll be in great condition in mid-November to be back for the national team. We'll take good care of him.

'He'll play for me when he has free time from the national team.' 

The Brazil-born striker has made a storming start to his Chelsea career in the Premier League
