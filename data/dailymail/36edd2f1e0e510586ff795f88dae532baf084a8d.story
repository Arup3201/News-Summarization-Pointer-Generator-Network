Special K's latest advertising campaign, titled 'shhhhut down fat talk' and spearheaded by model Tyra Banks, has been deemed 'ironic' and 'insincere' by critics.

The low calorie cereal brand calls for women to embrace their bodies and stop 'joking about cankles', 'muffin tops' and 'cellulite'.

However, one woman wrote on Facebook in response to the new initiative: 'Special K is about fighting FAT not 'fat talk.'

Sensitive subject: Special K's latest advertising campaign titled 'shhhhut down fat talk' has been slammed by critics for being 'ironic' - its new advert shows store tags replaced with self-deprecating remarks

'I'm not 
feeling authenticity from a brand dedicated to encouraging women to do 
ineffective deprivation diets and weight loss.'

Another added: 'So Special K is telling us we are fat and need to lose weight, but to stop saying it to ourselves? Are you ladies buying this?'

As part of the new campaign, Special K invited several women to a store that contained 
labels inscribed with things like 'feeling so disgusted at my figure at 
the moment #cow,' 'cellulite is in my DNA,' and 'I have a muffin top' 
in place of display signs and price tags.

'Special K promotes weight loss and then promotes not concerning yourself with your weight. It's ironic to me'

The ladies' reactions were caught on camera and combined into a short advert uploaded to YouTube on December 2.

'This is like looking at the inside of my
 head,' 'I feel sad' and 'it's like bullying yourself' were among the comments provided by the volunteer shoppers.

The advert's closing caption reads: 'You wouldn't talk this way to anyone else, so why do it to yourself? Let's shhhhut down fat talk.' 

Stop focusing on the negative: The cereal brand's aim is to get women loving their bodies

Alarming statistics: It claims that 93per cent of women engage in fat talk and many do it at least once a week

Horrified: Shoppers who saw the Special K store labels said that they could relate to what was inscribed on them and it was like 'looking inside their mind'

One
 viewer of the Special K advert said she thinks it sends a 'good message' and she was 
'touched' when she watched it but was distracted by the irony.

She continued: 'Doesn't Special K advertise their product as a way to lose weight? The 'Special K challenge'.  

'They promote weight loss and then promote not concerning yourself with your weight. It's ironic to me.'

A week after news of Special K's 'shhhhut down fat talk' campaign broke, its ambassador, Tyra Banks, posted a 'selfie' to
 Instagram and Twitter asking others to get on board.

The
 40-year-old model, who has spoken openly about her own weight and 
self-esteem issues in the past, appears pulling a 'silent pose' with her
 finger pressed to her mouth.

Feel good ambassador: A week after news of Special K's ''shhhhut down fat talk' campaign broke, Tyra Banks posted this 'selfie' to Instagram and Twitter asking others to get on board

She captioned the image: 'It’s time 2 strut through life w/ extra boom boom pow. #FightFatTalk w/ me & Special K by posting UR SHHHH selfie! [sic]'

In
 a press release she added: 'I know firsthand how much criticizing your 
body negatively affects self-esteem, but as a role model, I try to 
maintain a positive attitude and healthy approach to managing my weight,

'As a guy whose girlfriend is constantly negative about her appearance, wholeheartedly support this campaign'

'That’s why I’m excited to partner with Special K to help empower women to not only feel confident about their bodies, but also to remove those negative thoughts and show them how to employ tips and tricks to make their least liked physical attributes look better.

While some have questioned the authenticity of the campaign's message,hundreds of supporters have followed Miss Banks' lead.

Indeed, Twitter is awash with women recreating her 'selfie' pose including Fox news anchor, Laura Moody.

Weight loss properties: Special K prides itself on being low fat and low calorie

Ironic: Special K is known for its weight loss challenges - and adverts featuring slender models

And
 it's not just women supporting the initiate.

One
 man wrote, 'I fight with my girl about this all the time!' and another 
added 'as a guy whose girlfriend is constantly negative about her 
appearance, wholeheartedly support this campaign.'

According to Special K, 93per cent of women admit to engaging in fat talk and 63per cent say they do it at least once a week.

Stints of self-depreciation were most likely to occur in front of the mirror, during a girls’ night with friend and while out clothes shopping.

Forty one per cent of those aged between 18 and 34 said it’s also triggered by looking at photos of other women.

Special K is working hard to promote a healthy body image. Last year it ditched its slender models for the first time in 25 years in favour of plus-sized ‘real’ women.
