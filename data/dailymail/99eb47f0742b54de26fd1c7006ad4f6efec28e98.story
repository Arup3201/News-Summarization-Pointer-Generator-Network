An embalmer who lost his license after graphic remarks he made about dead bodies were published in a Boston newspaper has had the decision overturned by the highest court in Massachusetts.

Troy Schoeller’s license was revoked by a state board in 2010 after the panel found he violated its code of conduct by talking about bodies in his care in an 'unprofessional' manner.

Schoeller was quoted in Boston newspaper The Phoenix referring to the body of a baby as a 'bearskin rug.' He also said he hated embalming fat people.

Free speech: Troy Schoeller has had a decision to strip him of his embalming license overturned

The Massachusetts Board of Registration of Funeral Directors and Embalmers claimed that Schoeller violated their code of conduct

Schoeller argued that his constitutional right to free speech was violated by the board.

The Supreme Judicial Court on Friday found that the code of conduct prohibiting 'unprofessional' or 'undignified and salacious' comments is overboard and unconstitutional because it restricts a 'substantial amount of protected speech.'

Schoeller argued that state regulators chose to enforce a vague and overly broad provision of the code of conduct that prohibits funeral directors and embalmers from commenting on the condition of a body entrusted to their care.

Funeral directors and embalmers routinely talk about their work in trade journals and other publications to inform a curious public, and the provision should not be interpreted as barring them from ever talking publicly about what they do, said his lawyer, Jason Benzaken.

Schoeller was the first embalmer in Massachusetts to be disciplined on those grounds.

'I didn't lie about anything,' said Schoeller prior to today’s verdict. 'I didn't say anything that was wrong.' Although he admitted that he could have chosen his words more carefully.

Schoeller on the baby 'that looked like a bearskin rug':

'I had to rebuild it in nine hours. I
used everything: duct tape, masking tape, tissue builder, wound filler.
... I put, like, coat hangers and caulk in there and put him into a 
little baby outfit. ... He looked awesome.'

Schoeller on embalming fat people:

'And I really hate embalming fat people, like people who weigh 300 
pounds. Because when you cut open a fat person butter leaks out. 
Literally, yellow oil leaks out of the wound and floats on top of the 
water. If you put butter in the microwave and put it in the water, it 
turns into little balls - fat globules - and that’s what comes out of 
fat dead people. It’s so nasty.'

Schoeller's statements were truthful, 
did not disclose confidential information and pertained to a matter of 
'legitimate public concern,' and were therefore protected by the First 
Amendment and the state constitution, Benzaken said.

'People are interested in it; people have a right to know what happens to their deceased family members when they are brought into a funeral home,' he said.

The state Board of Registration of Funeral Directors and Embalmers claimed that Schoeller violated their code of conduct.

'Sensitivity, dignity, respect are at the very heart of this profession,' Assistant Attorney General Sookyoung Shin said.

'If his comments are OK, then any funeral director or embalmer in the state would have license to go out and describe the types of bodies that he finds nasty or that he finds amusing,' Shin said during arguments before the Supreme Judicial Court in January.

Schoeller, 35, worked as an embalmer for 13 years in Florida and Massachusetts before his license was revoked in 2010. He said he agreed to be interviewed by The Phoenix, an alternative weekly newspaper, after he opened a clothing store called Horror Business in Boston in 2006.

Schoeller said the reporter took notes during their first meeting so he knew whatever he said could be published. He said the second meeting was in a restaurant and much more casual, and he did not realize for much of the evening that the reporter was recording their conversation.

Schoeller said he would have used different language if he had realized his comments were going to be published.

Phoenix Editor-in-Chief Carly Carioli disputed Schoeller's claims. 'Schoeller's account is simply not true,' Carioli said.

In the article, Schoeller discusses his specialty - reconstructive art - describing how he works to restore traumatized bodies. He also made graphic remarks about how the bodies of overweight people react to the embalming process - describing it, among other things, as 'nasty' - and offered crude descriptions of his biological reactions to the fumes emanating from bodies.

Schoeller said his remarks were an 
attempt to show how he took pride in his work and how it is an art to 
him. He said he did not identify anyone in his remarks to the reporter.

The article also revealed that Schoeller goes by the nickname Rot, which he has tattooed on his back. He also fronts a thrash metal band called Beware!, while wearing a priest collar and covered in fake blood, and another band called Hardly.
