No sooner is one problem solved than another crops up. Alastair Cook is discovering, like his predecessors, that the idioms of the England Test captaincy translate awkwardly into the one-day. Not for the first time this summer, this column fears English cricket is in denial.

The Test team corrected things just in time: Cook resolved to get further forward to India’s seamers, Ian Bell woke up, an unfit Matt Prior was dropped, and the senior bowlers got their heads round the idea of an English length. It helped that India were a rabble.

But now that England are faced with eight months of 50-over cricket – and, at the risk of cheering everyone up, the prospect of a sixth successive World Cup failure – the merciless truth for Cook is that he now faces another set of searching questions.

One-day cricket has always left English cricket navel-gazing and head-scratching. Just ask Mike Atherton, Nasser Hussain, Michael Vaughan and Andrew Strauss. It is one of the most tiresome rituals in the modern game.

And it is deeply ingrained. English cricket prizes the stubbornness that helped Cook turn around the Test team. Grit, phlegm and the knowledge that, across a series lasting 25 days, substance will eventually trump style – these are what matter to the English cricket psyche. And they are perfectly attuned to the Test match. One-day cricket has always been an afterthought, partly because the English just aren’t on its more flamboyant wavelength.

It was ever thus. The mistake that England have been making for more than two decades is to imagine that the man chosen to get the best out of the Test team – the man who most unflinchingly embodies the grind-’em-down school of leadership – can also do the trick in the 50-over game. It was unfair on Atherton, Hussain, Vaughan and Strauss. It is unfair on Cook.

Curiously, England’s most enlightened one-day moment came with the appointment of Adam Hollioake in the late 1990s, a move which briefly allowed Atherton to concentrate on the Test job. England’s most recent multi-team tournament triumph came in Sharjah, way back in December 1997, under Hollioake. And while the probity of that success has always been the subject of whispers, Hollioake’s charisma and capacity to free up his players are still spoken of with awe by those involved.

The experiment did not last long. Soon after, England lost one-day series in the Caribbean and at home to South Africa, and Hollioake was back in the ranks. The split-captaincy was considered too radical, Hollioake probably too un-English. Yet it was his very un-Englishness that made him such a vibrant, instinctive leader.

England’s defeats last week at Cardiff and Trent Bridge were depressingly familiar. All MS Dhoni had to do was bowl his spinners – any spinner would do, even occasional wicketkeeper Ambati Rayudu – and he was again being hailed as a puppet-master extraordinaire. (Truly, it is amazing how short memories can be in sport: a fortnight ago, Dhoni’s Test humiliation was supposed to have robbed him of his final shreds of dignity.)

Yet to listen to Cook’s explanation for why his team managed only one boundary between the 18th and 44th overs in Nottingham was to play an old and broken record. It amounted to this: wickets had been falling too regularly to allow the risky big shots. He spoke as if the tumble of wickets was an inconvenience, visited upon his team by forces unknown.

Despite evidence that has been in the public domain ever since New Zealand opened with Mark Greatbatch at the 1992 World Cup – and was reinforced by Sanath Jayasuriya four years later – England cling tenaciously to the belief that wickets in hand matter above all else.

The belated inclusion of Alex Hales suggested that, in their heart of hearts, the selectors recognise this for the ante-diluvian thinking it undoubtedly is. But even with Hales in the current set-up, only he, Eoin Morgan and Jos Buttler have the capacity to destroy an attack. There are too many eggs in too few baskets.

Other teams’ top six or seven contain no more than one anchorman; England’s has at least two too many. And so totals of 230 become the norm. Once in a while, England will post 280-plus – yet even that may not be enough.

Perhaps any attempts at a rationalisation are futile. The dressing-room can protest all it likes: one-day cricket simply means less to this country than Tests. When that is the case, minds are not turned to the task in hand with quite the same rigour or vigour.

Lost again: Cook and England trudge off after defeat by India at Trent Bridge

India suffer the same problem, but in reverse. They seem resigned to their fate in Test matches if the ball isn’t turning, yet fully expect their naturally gifted stroke-makers to chase down any one-day target. These expectations become self-fulfilling.

The decision to stick with Cook as one-day captain is yet another example of a combination that has bedevilled our game ever since England reached the World Cup final in 1992: conservatism on the one hand, blind faith in the man whose main job is to lead the Test team on the other.

Stubbornness can work well in five-day cricket. In the one-day version it may be less useful.

THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS

A familiar tune

Graeme Swann thinks England don’t have ‘cat in hell’s chance’ of winning the World Cup. He’s probably right – and deserves kudos for commenting so frankly on players who until recently counted among his team-mates. 

But it never ceases to amaze how quickly ex-players make the transition from the field of play to the commentary box. Often, these same players were among the fiercest critics of the press. Now, these gamekeepers turn poachers as if it’s the most natural thing in the world.

This is all well and good, but can someone please explain to them while they’re still players that the occasional piece of media criticism does not mean the media are heartless and evil. It’s called doing our job. And Swann is doing his nicely.

Damned if he does...

Alastair Cook was unimpressed by Swann’s comments, leaving some to wonder about the wisdom of the press-conference retaliation. This followed Cook’s testy response back in June to Shane Warne’s relentless commentary-box advice.

But we can’t have it both ways: a captain can’t be damned for toeing some tedious, platitude-filled party line, then damned for giving an honest answer to a straight question.

The wheel of life

The tendency of most teams’ fans is to imagine that theirs is the most miserable lot in the world. Think of India a fortnight ago and England last week. And now throw Australia into the mix after a three-wicket one-day loss to Zimbabwe moved them from first in the world rankings to fourth.

‘There’s probably not enough expletives in the English language at the moment for the way I'm feeling,’ their coach Darren Lehmann said after Zimbabwe had beaten them for the first time since the Duncan Fletcher-inspired heist at the 1983 World Cup. 

‘It’s just embarrassing for everyone involved in the touring party, and I hope they’re hurting. They should be.’ 

They’ll forget it soon enough, and will probably win the World Cup next year. But no result feels more real than the one that’s just happened.
