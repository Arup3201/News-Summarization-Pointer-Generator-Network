Bosses at trendy clothing firm American Apparel have been rapped for a 'too sexy' advert showing a female model wearing a 'thong bodysuit'.

The firm, which has more than 270 stores across the world, regularly has its raunchy ads banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA).

In 2012 the firm had a string of ads banned in four different rulings after using photos of women exposing their breasts, showing off their bare bums and posing with their legs spread in its ad campaigns. 

This American Apparel advert featuring an underage-looking model has been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority 

And this week, the ASA again banned an advert showing a flame-haired model wearing a £30 spandex thong bodysuit covered with lipstick prints.

One person had complained to the ASA saying they believed the model in question looked under the age of 16 and that it was 'irresponsible and offensive' as it 'sexualised a model' who appeared to be underage.

Bosses at the ASA said that despite American Apparel saying the model was 20 years old, she looked 'youthful' and that the ad was irresponsible.

It stated: 'We considered the model had a youthful appearance and that some consumers were likely to regard her as being younger than 16 years of age.

'The model was shown looking back at the camera over her shoulder with her buttocks visible.

The campaign featured more than one picture of the girl in the bodysuit to '[depict] the thong from various angles'

'We considered that readers were likely to interpret the model's expression and pose as being sexual in nature.

'In conjunction with the youthful appearance of the model, we considered the ad could be seen to sexualise a child.

'We therefore concluded that the ad was irresponsible and was likely to cause serious offence.'

It added: 'The ad must not appear again in its current form.

'We told American Apparel (UK) Ltd to ensure future ads did not include images that inappropriately sexualised young women or were likely to cause serious offence.'

Bosses at the clothing firm said the the model was 20 and that the ad 'depicted the thong from various angles'.

This isn't  the first time that American Apparel has been in trouble for their adverts. 

Last September, a  campaign for the fashion brand American Apparel has been banned for ‘sexualising school-age girls’.

Photographs of its ‘School Days’ range included a young woman bending over in an ultra- short tartan skirt with her white underwear on display.

In a scathing attack, the advertising watchdog labelled the campaign ‘gratuitous’ and ‘sexist’. 

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said ‘the focus was on her buttocks and groin rather than on the skirt being modelled’.

It also accused the firm of promoting seedy ‘up-skirt’ photographs – when unauthorised pictures are taken from beneath a woman’s skirt.

The brand launched its Back-to-School range with the slogan, ‘Your first assignment is to dress accordingly.’

Last year, the fashion company got in trouble for this picture of a 'schoolgirl' leaning over a car door 

The campaign included pictures of a model bent over touching the ground, revealing her crotch and underwear, while another showed a woman bending over a red car in a thigh-skimming green tartan skirt and her buttocks on show.

The ASA said: ‘We considered the images were gratuitous and objectified women, and were therefore sexist and likely to cause serious and widespread offence.

Last January,the brand stirred up controversy for decking out its mannequins with very visible patches of untamed pubic hair.

A storefront at the retailer's East Houston location in New York featured three mannequins clad in transparent white underwear, exposing their unkempt bikini lines.
