A 14-year-old schoolgirl is on life support in hospital after being brutally gang-raped in rural India.

Police have failed to make any arrests since the horrific attack in the Jalandhar district of Punjab ten days ago.

Yesterday Punjab Congress president Capt Amarinder Singh condemned the attack and expressed his concerns over the 'rising incidents' of rape in the state.

Attack: A 14-year-old schoolgirl lies on life support after a brutal gang rape ten days agoÂ  for which no one has yet been arrested

Capt Singh said he was shocked by the fact that none of the accused had been arrested ten days after the incident took place.

He said: 'This reflects the state of affairs as how casually the police have taken such a serious offence,'

Capt Singh added that an average of 40 rapes were taking place every month in Punjab.

He said girl was now getting the best medical treatment possible after being moved to a hospital in the Punjabi city of Amristar.

Doctors say she is stable but that they would be able to comment on her health only after another 24 hours.

Location: The girl was attacked in in Shahkot in the Jalandhar district of India's Punjab

Mocking Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Badal's claims that Punjab was the safest state in the country he added: 'This for sure cannot be described to be the safest state in the country as this government will try to make us believe.'

Capt Singh said 12 convicted rapists were pardoned last year, something that in his opinion reflected the government's casual attitude to the crime.

The former Chief Minister insisted the government must not wriggle out of the responsibility by merely saying that it will bear the cost of the treatment.

A 14-year old girl was allegedly abducted and gang-raped by three persons in Mandhala Channa village here on January 28 when she had gone out of her home to relieve herself.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
