Firefighters racing to the scene of an early-morning blaze in a Colorado neighborhood arrived to find the words 'my wife's a cheater' scrawled on the outside of the home.

The phrase was sprayed twice across the front of the house in Nelson Street, Arvada when firefighters responded to reports of an explosion at 1.30am on Tuesday.

They also found debris in the street, including patio furniture, fire officials said.

7News reported that a name was also painted on the side of the house but it is not clear if he is connected to the fire.

Accusation: Firefighters in Arvada, Colorado found the words 'My wife is a cheater' scrawled on a side of a home where they responded to a blaze on Tuesday morning

A few hours later, police said they had arrested a man on suspicion of arson in connection with the fire. They said they would release his identity on Tuesday afternoon. 

Neighbors told KDVR that a couple with three young children live at the home.

The Arvada Fire Protection District said everyone in the home had been accounted for and there were no reports of injuries.

After multiple calls from neighbors, the district responded to the home early on Tuesday and found it engulfed in flames.

'Upon their arrival, they were faced with a lot of fire that was coming from the front of the house as well as the back of the house,' spokesperson Deputy Fire Marshall Deanna Harrington told the Denver Post.

Blaze: Firefighters were able to put out the flames but the home is significantly damaged by the fire

Destroyed: Later on Tuesday morning, firefighters covered the graffiti outside the house with blue tarps

Crews are unable to enter the home because the floor has been weakened by the 'very significant' damage, she said. 

After the flames were brought under control, officials covered up the scrawled words with blue tarps.

No nearby homes were damaged by the fire. 

The cause of the fire has not been released and it remains under investigation, the district said. 

Neighbors expressed their shock over the incident. 

'It's a younger family,' Fred Holman told KDVR. 'They've lived here about five years, maybe a little longer. They're very nice people, very good neighbors. I would never think anything like this would happen.'
