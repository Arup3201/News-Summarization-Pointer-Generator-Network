New York City's West Indian Day Parade has been marred by violence before it even started after a fatal shooting - but it didn't stop some 2million people from turning out to watch the wild and colorful celebration today. 

Several people were shot Sunday night and Monday morning near the route of the famed Caribbean celebration in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn. The New York Police Department said a 55-year-old man was shot and killed about 3.30am today. Officers have arrested a suspect. 

Several other shootings were reported in the area, as well.  

The celebration's history of violence in recent years led to a major police crackdown - with more than 4,000 NYPD officers on hand to keep tabs on gang activity and keep order.  

Colorful floats, elaborate costumes, politicians and merrymakers filled the streets this afternoon ins spite of the violence and police promises to enforce 'quality of life' violations.

Revelry: Hundreds of people dressed up in colorful costumes and turned out Monday for the West Indian Day Parade in Brooklyn, New York

Hundreds of revelers in colorful costumes are taking part in the West Indian Day Parade on Monday. Before the parade even kicked off, several people were shot and one was killed near the parade route

'I love the culture, the dancing, the food and the fun,' said Giovanni Oriol, 35, a Brooklyn resident of Haitian descent. 

'My culture is very important to me, and this is a celebration of all that is good about all of these people and places.'

Mayor Bill de Blasio defended the importance of the parade despite the violence that has all-too-frequently surrounded it.

"The vast, vast majority have a wonderful time and only a few individuals get out of line," he said after a breakfast attended by elected officials, parade organizers and local dignitaries before the parade.

"This parade started small, became big and is one of the great events in our city," he said.

Sporting a colorful tribal shirt, the mayor was joined on the hot, humid day by his wife, Chirlane McCray, who is of Caribbean decent, and their children, Dante and Chiara. They received cheers throughout the march and frequently shook hands with revelers.

Crackdown: Police vowed to be out in force. Some 4,000 officers were tapped to enforce order at the parade

This was de Blasio's first time marching as mayor; a year ago, the raucous reception he received at the parade foreshadowed his blowout win in the Democratic primary. He and his family marked the occasion last year by debuting a family dance they dubbed "The Smackdown," which calls for them to pantomime licking their hands, swirling them over the heads, slapping their palms to the concrete and then jumping backward.

The burdens of office didn't stop the family from delivering an encore performance Monday, drawing cheers from the sweaty crowd and a gasp from the parade's master of ceremonies.

Governor Andrew Cuomo also received a warm welcome a week from his bid to reclaim the Democratic nomination. Cuomo's long-shot opponent, Zephyr Teachout, was also in attendance. She spent much of the parade granting interview requests when she wasn't dancing and waving at flag-toting partiers.

The NYPD's 77th Precinct circulated a flyer warning it would be cracking down on public drinking, sidewalk grilling, loud music and other 'quality of life' violations in an effort to quell violence and maintain order. 

'Residents and store owners are advised to cooperate fully. Those who do not comply will be summonsed or possibly arrested,'  the flyer warned.

'Undercover officers, members of the Consumer Affairs Dept and other Enforcement Agencies will be doing random inspections without notice. Loud speakers will be confiscated and owners summonsed.' 

Some Crown Heights neighbors complained the NYPD is trying to stop residents from enjoying themselves in the hopes that the parade eventually ends entirely.

Some neighbors fear that the police crackdown will hamper the fun at the annual event

'It's a parade. It's a celebration, so I don't think you should crack down,' one resident told NY1. 'That's really going to put fear in people and maybe even more anger.'

The parade is one of the biggest outdoor events in New York - and political see-and-be-seen hotspot.The parade is a prime place for officeholders and candidates to greet the public the week before Primary Day.

Last year, two people were shot, one was slashed and an NYPD officer sustained minor injuries making an arrest.  In 2012, two people were stabbed to death and two were shot and wounded.
