One of Manchester United's summer targets, Juan Cuadrado, has insisted he is happy to have stayed with Fiorentina after failing to seal a move before the transfer window closed on Monday.

A move didn't materialise for the Colombia international - who was also wanted by Barcelona and Bayern Munich - meaning Cuadrado will remain with the Italian side this season.

'I heard the rumours about Barcelona and Manchester United,' he told reporters in Colombia, according to Football Italia.

'But that truth is that I have always remained calm. I'm happy to stay in Florence for at least another season.

'I'm good here.'

Cuadrado has spent the past two seasons with Fiorentina since joining the Viola from Serie A rivals Udinese in 2012. 

Settled: Cuadrado is happy in Florence having joined Fiorentina from Udinese two summers ago
