It has provided a luxurious night's sleep for 15 generations of the same aristocratic family.

This antique four-poster with its ornate carved headboard was built for the residents of the Berkeley Castle estate in Gloucestershire in 1608 and has been used for more than 400 years.

Far from being roped off into retirement
 like many pieces of historic furniture, John Berkeley, 81, and his wife
 Georgina, 73, still use the bed in the castle's Great State Bedroom.

Treasured: This 400-year old bed has provided a good night's rest for 15 generations of the Berkeley family

Ornate: Its carved bed posts are thought to represent Henry, Baron Berkeley and his wife Jane

The bed was identified by retailer 
Furniture Village which launched a challenge to find the piece of 
furniture that has remained in continuous use by the same family the 
longest.

Furniture historians say the style of the bed posts date them to the period 1560 to 1640. They believe the royal arms in the middle of the headboard are those of the Stuart monarchy, dating the bed more specifically to the period after the accession of James I in 1603.

It has been suggested that the male and female figures in the pedestals represent Henry Berkeley, 7th Baron Berkeley, and his second wife, Jane.

Georgina Berkeley said: 'Despite its great age, it is the most comfortable bed in the castle. Sleeping in such a wonderfully historic bed conveys a real feeling of British history.'

The Berkeley family is recognised in British noble history for having an unbroken, identifiable male line of descent from a Saxon ancestor who lived before the Norman Conquest of England in 1066.

The first feudal baron of Berkeley, 
Robert Fitzharding, died in 1170 and was reputedly the grandson of 
Eadnoth the Constable, a high official under King Edward the Confessor.

Henry Berkeley was born in 1534 and 
named after his godfather, King Henry VIII. His mother, Anne, was a 
lady-in-waiting and companion of Queen Anne Boleyn, the second wife of 
the king.

He was a politician and became Lord Lieutenant and Vice Admiral of Gloucestershire.

The bed is listed on an inventory 
taken on September 20 1608 of New Park Lodge, a family property on the 
Berkeley Castle estate. The grade I building is believed to be the 
oldest private castle in England still inhabited by the family which 
built it.

The Berkeleys stay in private apartments in the castle, which is open to visitors between April and October.

Charlie Harrison, marketing director 
at Furniture Village, said: 'Our research revealed that, although people
 pass on items of furniture to loved ones and treasured items can remain
 in the family, after a few generations the stories of the original 
owners become forgotten.

'What makes the Berkeley bed so 
unique is that it is still used by the same family and its moment of 
appearance can be accurately dated.

'Most importantly, of course, the 
400-year-old Berkeley Castle bed offers compelling evidence that nothing
 beats British furniture for craftsmanship and durability.'
