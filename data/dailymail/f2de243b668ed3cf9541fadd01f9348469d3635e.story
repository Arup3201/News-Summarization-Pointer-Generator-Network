A New Zealand retail outlet has been forced to defend criticism about an incredibly thin mannequin displayed in one of its stores.

The thinly-shaped female model photographed by a New Zealand University student, Emily Robins, has sparked intense discussion about female body issues and how women should be represented.

Ms Robbins, 25, tweeted the image she photographed inside Fashion retailer Glassons accompanied by the caption: 'Purging is in this season!' and has been the subject of intense criticism by health experts despite the company's boss deeming the model 'healthy.'

Ms Robins, a former actress on New Zealand show Shortland St, tweeted the mannequin has the potential to make women feel inadequate and that was a form of 'control.'

But the company's boss, Graeme Popplewell, told Stuff.co.nz  that science determines what a healthy weight is and defended the woman wearing the two piece bikini as 'healthy.'

He said the mannequin's proportions meant it would have a 'healthy' body-mass index (BMI) of 18.8, just above what would be classed as underweight at 18.4.

He also said that because of the way the mannequin is positioned - its arm raised and slightly inverted - people are led to believe that it is thinner than it really is.

He said a female in a similar position would have an enhanced rib cage. He also said the position of the lights in the store, relative to the body,  accentuates the woman's rib cage.

'The key is that due to the position of the mannequin with the arm elevated and slightly twisted, the rib cage is naturally enhanced as it would be in real life,' Popplewell said. 

But Ms Robins said the debate should not be based around a classification of what is deemed healthy, but  making women feel more adequate about their body image. 

'It's not the mannequin would have a healthy BMI, it's we need a wider range of representations for women's bodies,' she tweeted.

A New Zealand Women's Health Action director Julie Radford-Poupard said the mannequin undoubtedly 'full on.'

The retail stores should bare the responsibility for the image they put out to customers, she said, and respect different shapes and sizes in women.

A 2011 University of Otago and Ministry of Health survey showed the average BMI for a Kiwi woman was 27.6 - classified as 'overweight'.

University of Waikato  lecturer in health education Debi Futter-Puati said the 'incredibly thin' mannequin was 'disturbing'.

'When I look at that image with all her ribs showing, the message it's sending is that that's desirable and that's the way you're supposed to look as a young woman.' 

'What's the message they're hoping to give by using a mannequin like that - that if you wear our clothes you'll look this so-called 'good'?'

She said developing girls between 10 and 12 would be exposed to the image and perpetuate the myth that you had to be thin to be healthy.

'Let's ask Glassons to have a diverse range of women's shapes and sizes that portray much more everyday New Zealand women. Let's be real.'
