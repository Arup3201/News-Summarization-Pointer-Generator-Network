A super-spicy burger on sale in Brighton is being touted as the hottest in Britain - after five people landed in hospital attempting to eat it.

Nick Gambardella, who serves the XXX Hot Chilli Burger in his restaurant in the popular seaside town, asks customers - who must be over-18 - to sign a legal disclaimer before trying it.

The dish has a chilli sauce on it measuring an eye-watering 9.2million on the Scoville scale which measures spicy heat in foods - compared to an average chilli pepper at 500 Scoville units.

On one occasion, a diner was taken to hospital with a suspected perforated bowel after eating the dish. Four others were admitted for treatment on the same night for suspected Anaphylactic shock.

Now diners who want to eat the XXX burger are asked to sign a document first drawn up by Gambardella saying: 'I the undersigned accept all responsibility for any effects incured (sic) due to the consumtion (sic) of the above mentioned xxxx Hot Chilli Burger and release Burger Off, its owner and staff from any liability.'

The dish is sold at his Burger Off restaurant in Brighton, Sussex, said: 'I am amazed I am allowed to sell it - but it's been a massive hit with the customers.

'I have spoken to people at environmental health but they think it is hilarious. Trading Standards came in and I tried to convince the guy to have one but he wouldn't have it.

"I have to admit I've not dared to try one of these burgers myself as they are so spicy. One night five ambulances arrived and I've heard the local hospital had people on crash mats on adrenalin drips from my chilli burger.

'Obviously I always take my responsibilities as a food retailer seriously but if my customers want super spicy food, I am entitled to give them what they want. The burgers are cooked properly - it's the sauce that is maybe too hot to handle.

'One of my customers works at the local hospital and they came down to tell me that staff held a two hour meeting about my chilli burger and that they are changing how they treat "the fallen".

'They've now decided that an adrenalin drip is more effective for dealing with the anaphylactic shock that the burger sometimes brings on.

'Why the customers eat it I don't know, because I always say to them that it is incredibly hot and give them all the health warnings under the sun.

'I think these people are slightly mad to eat it but I'm sure there is a certain level of peer pressure. A lot of people just regard it as a challenge.'

The burger gets its heat from a red-hot sauce based on a piri piri chilli concentrate created through steaming and is later infused with carbon dioxide.

Legal waiver: Nick won't allow anyone to try the spicy burger without signing a legal disclaimer

So far just 59 out of 3,000 challengers have succeeded in eating the whole burger.

The dish, sold at Â£3.90, is said to have caused customers to adopt a number of undignified coping mechanisms from stripping naked, begging for mercy, punching windows and vomiting.

Many suffer from anaphylactic shock, a severe allergic reaction, can be brought on by certain foods, medication or animal stings and can leave the sufferer with swelling, rashes and difficulty breathing.

Nick said: 'You get used to it. Unlike most man vs food challenges, here at Burger Off you don't get a reward.

'One guy came in and he was just a little bit cocky and when he left he was admitted to hospital because prior to eating the burger he had a stomach ulcer and we believe it perforated his bowel.

'He wasn't in a good way but he pulled through.

'The first time someone had the burger and couldn't take the heat it was a bit of a shock but we thought 'well we told you.' We never call an ambulance, it's always the customer who calls.'

Customers willing to try the XXX Hot Chilli Burger vary in age from young men to parents attempting to show their kids how it is done, however Burger Off also offer a cocktail stick sample for those more timid customers.

He added: 'People always ask where I get the sauce from but I always say "If I tell you I will have to kill you." I just got fed up with people saying "well it's not really that hot".

'So I thought, well let's make it hotter. Now it's got a bit of a following from people travelling for miles to challenge a friend or themselves.

'We aren't one of these gourmet burger places. But it seems to work as we are usually always busy.'

Many of the foolhardy conquerors have taken to Twitter and The Burger Off Facebook page to spread the word about the burger.

Even former Big Brother star Pete Bennett attempted the challenge only to end up writhing on the pavement.

Douglas Hogarth posted: 'My brother had heard all these bold statements beforehand about how he went to Dubai and Delhi and demanded their hottest possible curry and it barely made him break a sweat.

'He got two bites into The XXX and gave up. Then spent two days recovering.'

One Facebook user said: 'Sadly I can confirm that this Burger is no joke.'
