Prince Harry has created a scholarship to get wounded veterans behind the wheel of an iconic Spitfire.

The scheme, inspired by Second World War pilot Douglas Bader, will see the strongest candidates move up from a Tiger Mother biplane, to a Harvard, to the bespoke craft.

It is the latest project launched under his charity, the Endeavour Fund, set up in 2011 with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to ensure that wounded, injured and sick 
servicemen and women have the chance to rediscover themselves through 
physical challenges.

virtual flying schools across the UK staffed and run by the wounded, 
injured and sick

Appearing at a special track day for veterans, the prince met Battle of 
Britain RAF pilots, Spitfire pilot instructors and viewed a Spitfire in 
the hangar at Boultbee Flight Academy at Goodwood.

With
his mentoring support, the Academy is working 
with Aerobility and Flying For Freedom, a non-profit organisation 
partnered with Help for Heroes whose mission is to create virtual flying
 schools across the UK staffed and run by the wounded, injured and sick.

The candidates will be picked this summer, giving them a year to train for the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain next September.

Harry, an Apache helicopter pilot, launched the scholarship by climbing into the cockpit of a Spitfire and starting it.

Eric Carter, a 94-year-old veteran, said: 'I went up in that Spitfire last year. It was pretty good after 70 years — so you'd better look after it,' The Sunday Times reported.

Harry replied: 'I guarantee that us pilots now are nowhere near as good as you guys would be — but nowadays with technology the aircraft seem to have minds of their own.'

John
 Laity, expedition co-founder for Flying For Freedom, gave the prince a 
tiny jumpsuit for his nephew, George, and told him he was going to be 
the best uncle in the world. He said the prince asked him whether it was
 the real thing or a onesie.

RAF
 Corporal Alan Robinson, 35, who is involved with Flying For Freedom, 
spoke to the Prince about how the fund has helped to train servicemen to
 become microlight pilots.

His aim is to fly a microlight to the Antarctic, he said.

The announcement came as the prince and charity patron appeared at a special track day.

Behind the wheel of a sky blue Aston Martin, the smiling Prince sped around Goodwood Motor Circuit in West Sussex in a range of vintage vehicles - as young woman was bizarrely left holding his shoes.

Serious work: The Prince also took time to meet

injured and sick servicemen and women have the chance to rediscover 
themselves through physical challenges

It does this by offering funding for new events and helping new projects with advice, hands-on support and mentoring, a spokeswoman for Kensington Palace said.

So far, The Endeavour Fund has supported more than 300 men and women via projects including the Walking With The Wounded trek to the South Pole, Race2Recovery, Walk On Wales, Flying For Freedom and a Fastnet Race team.

Prince Harry joined servicemen speeding around the circuit in cars including a 1964 two-series blue Aston Martin DB4, a black Lamborghini, a silver Aston Martin and a red Jaguar, a prototype F-type Coupe R.

He even removed his shoes before getting behind the wheel of the Aston Martin, with a track official seen bizarrely holding them rather than leaving them on the floor.

Go! The Prince looks exhilarated by the experience of driving the sports car on the West Sussex course

Among those taking was Captain Mark Jenkins, who was part of a team of four who took part in Row2Recovery, sailing from the Canary Islands to Antigua in the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge.

The 34-year-old, who is part of the Royal Army Medical Corp, was joined by amputees, soldiers Cayle Royce and Scott Blaney, and fellow serviceman James Kayll.

He said the project would not have been possible without a £30,000 grant from The Endeavour Fund.

Capt Jenkins said they received the funds after going through a 'Dragons' Den-style' presentation.

He
 said: 'It's the best thing you have ever done, the hardest thing you 
have ever done, the worst thing you have ever done, all in one 
experience. It's hard to mentally and physically motivate yourself to 
keep going.'

Capt Jenkins 
said the scariest moments were when their boat capsized and getting a 
bit too close to a few ocean liners for comfort. He said the team were hoping to raise £100,000.

David Wiseman, who was a captain in the Yorkshire Regiment, joined The Endeavour Fund last year after taking part in challenges for Walking With The Wounded.

The 31-year-old, who was shot in the chest in Afghanistan, climbed Manaslu, in Nepal, the eighth highest mountain in the world, in 2011, and attempted Everest in 2012.

He said he joined the fund because he knew the power challenges like this could harness in people who have been injured.
