Error: Despite her astonishing success in the cycling team pursuit, not everything has gone to plan for Laura Trott, pictured. The 20-year-old has taken to Twitter this morning to complain that her her golden post box will be placed in Harlow, Essex when it should be in Cheshunt

Yesterday she was on top of the world after thrashing the U.S to win an Olympic gold medal in a world record time.

But despite her astonishing success in the cycling team pursuit, not everything has gone to plan for Laura Trott.

The 20-year-old has taken to Twitter this morning to complain that her golden post box will be placed in Harlow, Essex, when it should be 13 miles away in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire.

She has now asked her 22,000 followers to contact the Post Office on her behalf to see if it can be changed.

The gold-medal winner wrote: 'So people i need you to tweet @PostOffice for me.. my postbox is going in harlow which isnt in my hometown Cheshunt is where it should be!!'

The star was clearly thrilled by the prospect of having a golden postbox as she had last night asked her followers to tweet her pictures of them next to it.

Her tweet prompted a response from a number of her fans, including cycling great Sir Chris Hoy.

Referring to her attempt to win a second gold in the Omnium event, he said: 'You're just going to have to win another one in the omnium and get it in the right place!'

The confusion appears to come from the fact that Trott was born in Harlow but now lives in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire.

She grew up in Hertfordshire and attended Turnford secondary school in Cheshunt.

Every time a British athlete wins a gold medal in the Olympics or Paralympics, Royal Mail is painting a post box in their home town gold to celebrate.

A dedicated team armed with brushes and tins of gold paint are going to be busy dashing around the country to transform post boxes within days of a medal win.

The first golden post box was unveiled outside Westminster Abbey in London.

It is the first time since 1874 that the Royal Mail has changed its iconic red post boxes.

Request for help: Trott has now asked her 22,000 followers to contact the Post Office on her behalf to see if the location of her golden post box can be changed

Mistake: The confusion appears to come from the fact that Trott was born in Harlow but now lives in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire

Many of Britain's first boxes were pained green in order to blend in with the countryside, but the bright red colour was introduced to make them more visible to the public.

Royal Mail stressed that collections from the golden boxes will remain the same despite the new look and that they would in time return to the normal red colour.

Tim Cowen of Royal Mail said the mistake was made because her home town is listed as Harlow on the Team GB website.

'We tweeted her straight back to say we'll be delighted to do one in Cheshunt as well.'

Tribute: This gold post box is for cyclist Victoria Pendelton in Stotfold, Bedfordshire

Astonishing: The trio are pictured in action yesterday. Not only did they win the Olympic title, they smashed their own world record

Mr Cowen said the company would paint
a box near where she went to primary school, but it could be delayed 
until tomorrow due to Britain's run of gold medals.

'We are running a little short on gold
paint, which is testament to Team GB's success. We'll be getting more 
supplies tomorrow,' he added.

The incredible trio of Joanna 
Rowsell, Laura Trott and Dani King not only won the Olympic title, they 
smashed their own world record.

In
a week of cycling gold medals from the men's sprinters, team pursuiters
and Victoria Pendleton, itÂ  was perhaps the most impressive performance
of the lot.
