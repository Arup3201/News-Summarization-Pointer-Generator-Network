Coastguards were last night searching for a man who was swept out to sea as he scattered ashes.

The 51-year-old, who has not been named, was at Port William, near Tintagel, North Cornwall, when he was hit by a large wave.

Two members of his group went into the sea in an attempt to rescue him but were unsuccessful.

Falmouth Coastguard scrambled a search-and-rescue helicopter, while a lifeboat was launched and teams also searched the shoreline.

Neil Oliver, of Falmouth Coastguard, said last night: ‘We have now been searching for four hours and sadly the man has not been found.

‘The helicopter and lifeboats have now completed their searches but two Coastguard rescue teams continue their work. Conditions have been unfavourable with gale-force winds and rough seas.’

It is not known to whom the ashes belonged.
