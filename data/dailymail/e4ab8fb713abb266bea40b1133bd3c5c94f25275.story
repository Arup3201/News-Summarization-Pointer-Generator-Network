Tragic Bobbi Kristina Brown was on the run from authorities when she was discovered unconscious in the bath, Daily Mail Online can reveal exclusively.

A warrant for Whitney Houston’s fragile daughter was issued on 28th January by the Alpharetta Municipal Court because she had failed to attend a court hearing two weeks earlier.

Bobbi Kristina had been stopped by traffic officers on September 9 last year because she was driving her luxury Lexus IS250 sports car with an expired registration in Alpharetta, Georgia.

The 21-year-old was ordered to attend a court on January 14 to answer the charges – a minor offence that carries a maximum penalty of a $2,500 fine, as well as having the car impounded. 

Repeat offenders face up to 12-months in jail.

Under cover: Two days before Bobbi Kristina Brown was found unconscious in her tub, a warrant  was issued on January 28 by the Alpharetta Municipal Court because she had failed to attend a court hearing two weeks earlier

Drive: Bobbi Kristina behind the wheel of the recently smashed up Lexis on January 19.  her partner Nick Gordon had been driving the car. She was supposed to be in court on January 14 to answer charges that she was driving with an expired registration

 

The Lexus allegedly wrecked by Bobbi Kristina's partner Nick Gordon. Cops say Gordon smashed up the luxury grey sports sedan's front end in a nasty accident near their home in Roswell, Georgia in early January. Bobbi Kristina was a passenger at the time and drove the vehicle home while her beau was arrested on a failure to appear warrant in an unrelated case.

But Miss Brown failed to appear at the Alpharetta Municipal Court and the judge, the Honorable Lee Whiteside, issued the bench warrant for her immediate arrest.

The warrant for Bobbi K Brown, and directed to ‘all the Sheriffs, Deputy Sheriffs, Constables, Coroners, and Police Officers’, states: ‘An accusation has been filed under oath in the Municipal Court of Alpharetta against the above said for; Failure To Appear.

‘Whereas, upon the call of said case in its order on I/14/2015 in open court the said defendant Failed To Appear and the bond given in the said case was forfeited.

‘Now, therefore, you and each of you are commanded in the state, to apprehend the said defendant and bring him/her before me to be dealt with as the law directs and to make a diligent search for all and singular, both real and personal, of the said defendant, or so much thereof as may be sufficient for the payment of all legal cost and expenses that will be incurred.’

Upon arrest Whitney Houston’s daughter would have been immediately put in jail and would spend up to 72 hours behind bars until a hearing could be set for her to answer the charges.

A source with knowledge of the charges told Daily Mail Online the warrant was issued for Bobbi Kristina Brown at the end of January.

‘She failed to show up in court for a traffic offence. She was driving with expired registration.

‘It is a minor charge but not appearing in court is a serious offence.

‘Because she never showed up she would have been sent straight to jail when she was arrested.’

The warrant has now been dismissed due to ‘recent events’, Alpharetta Police Department confirmed in a statement issued on February 5. 

Spokesman George Gordon said: ‘I confirm the Alpharetta Department of Public Safety had an active warrant from Ms Bobbi Kristina Brown.

‘The warrant was issued because she failed to show up for a mandatory court appearance after being cited for operating a motor vehicle with expired tag registration.

‘The warrant was issued due to her failure to appear in court at the mandated date and time.

‘In light of recent events involving Ms Bobbi Kristina Brown, we are not focused on the warrant issue. In fact, we requested the court to recall the warrant and dismiss it – which they did.

‘The important issue is we hope her friends and family find a measure of comfort during this difficult period.’

The warrant provides further evidence of the chaotic lifestyle the 21-year-old was leading in the time up to her current crisis.

In 2012 she was involved in three car crashes, one of which totaled her partner Nick Gordon’s Chevrolet Camaro.

Ms Brown rammed the $24,000 sports car, causing severe damage to front of the vehicle, as she tried to back into a parking space.

Police issued Ms Brown with a traffic citation for ‘failure to maintain lane’ following another incident.

She lost control of her car, hitting several small trees and drove over a curb, when she roared out of her apartment complex in Alpharetta, Georgia.

Bobbi Kristina's partner Nick Gordon is due in court in Atlanta, Georgia, on Monday to answer charges of driving recklessly.

Bobbi and Nick Gordon looked very happy together. Then tragedy struck

Bobbi Kristina miraculously escaped unscathed after allegedly wrecking Nick's Chevy Camaro in 2012. Police conducted an official accident investigation and believe Bobbi Kristina lost control of her car while making a turn out of her Alpharetta, Georgia apartment complex

Gordon, 25, was caught driving at over twice the speed limit along a suburban road in November 2012.

He was doing 82 miles an hour in a 35 miles an hour zone near to his home in Alpharetta, Georgia.

Now Gordon must appear at the Fulton County State Court to answer the charges.

The indictment states: 'I, Carmen D Smith, Solicitor General for the County of Fulton, State of Georgia, in the name and on behalf of the citizens of Georgia do hereby charge and accuse Nicholas Gordon with the offense of Speeding, a misdemeanor, for that said accused in the County of Fulton, State of Georgia did on or about November 28, 2012, while on the operation of a motor vehicle drive said vehicle at a speed of 82 miles per hour, the lawful maximum speed limit on said highway being 35, in violation of O.C.G.A 40-6-181, contrary to the laws of this State, the good order, peace and dignity thereof.'
