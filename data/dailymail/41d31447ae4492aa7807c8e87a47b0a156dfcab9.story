It is the world's most southerly post office and the most popular tourist destination in Antarctica.

Each year, around 70,000 cards are posted at the remote  hub, destined for more than 100 different countries.

But the staff at Port Lockroy, who spend the Antarctic summer manning their remote outpost, are joined each year by 3,000 gentoo penguins.

Located on Goudier Island, 700 miles south of the Chile and Argentina coastlines, the unusual post office sends out cards and letter which will take between two and six weeks to reach their destinations.

Run by the United Kingdom Antarctic Heritage Trust on behalf of the Government, the remote base receives an income from the Post Office and a small gift shop which goes towards the renovation of historic sites in Antarctica. 

The unusual spot has become a favourite stop-off with tourists arriving on cruise ships from around the world to explore the stark continent and learn about its wildlife.

Port Lockroy is home to 3,000 gentoo penguins who return each year to find a mate and raise their young

Port Lockroy was first discovered in 1873 by German Edward Dorman and became known as a safe place to anchor and shelter form storms, as well as an area where whalers processed their catch.

In the early 20th century, as nations battled to lay claim to parts of Antarctica, Britain sent men and two huts, known as Base A and Base B, to construct a permanent presence at Port Lockroy. 

It is those bases that still exist today, and the post office is a throwback to the small one constructed by the men to send letters back to loved ones.

The site is preserved as a historic attraction, showing the spot where Britain laid claim to a part of Antarctica with a permanent base in the early 20th century

The post office also has a small guft shop and museum, explaining the history of Britain's presence 

After being closed in 1962, the huts fell into disrepair, but were restored in the 1990s with the idea of protecting the area as a historic monument. 

Now a small museum shows how the men lived in the 1950s at the remote outpost. 

Each year, in time for the Antarctic summer, a small staff crosses the notorious Drake Passage from South America to staff the post office for five months.

Each year the post office processes around 70,000 cards sent to 100 different countries

There is no running water, no electricty and even in summer, the temperatures are freezing.

As staff man the post office, around 3,000 gentoo penguins flock to the area to find a mate and raise their young.

Since the historic outpost was renovated in 1996, the penguins have also been monitored, to better understand how they live and help protect them.

And the famous post office has also become the subject of numerous documentaries, such as a partnership between the BBC and American channel PBS.
