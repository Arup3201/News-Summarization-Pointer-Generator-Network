The problem of finding space to restock the fridge with bottles of beer is over because a revolutionary magnetic device 'hangs' them inside.

Named bottleLoft, the gadget suspends bottles of beer from the top of a fridge using magnets.

By doing this it frees up empty space in the fridge to gives the user more room to store food, drink and other things.

Design engineer Brian Conti from North Carolina has created magnetic strips called bottleLoft to hold beer bottles in fridges (shown). They stick to the top of the fridge and hold up to six bottles. The device can be bought for £12 ($20) and is currently on Kickstarter

The unique device, which holds three standard sized bottles of beer, is eight inches (20.3cm) long and 1.5 inches (3.8cm) wide.

The team are currently seeking funding on Kickstarter, with each strip of magnets costing about £12 ($20).

Beer, or at least one of its ingredients, could boost brain function, a new study has found.

But a leisurely pint is unlikely to have any intellectual benefit, because a person would need to drink the equivalent of 3,520 pints (2,000 litres) a day to stand any chance of boosting their cognitive abilities.

Researchers at Oregon State University demonstrated that xanthohumol -a type of flavonoid found in hops and beer - improved cognitive function in young mice.

Flavonoids are compounds found in plants that often give them their colour and scientists have been studying them in blueberries, dark chocolate and red wine to uncover any potential benefits that could help fight cancer and heart disease, for example.

Scientists hope that xanthohumol could be used to treat metabolic syndrome, a condition associated with obesity and high blood pressure, as well as age-related deficits in memory. The rare micronutrient is found in the hops, commonly used to make beer. 

It uses Neodymium magnets, the strongest type of commercial magnet available, to hold on to the bottle caps and the whole device attaches to the 'ceiling' of a fridge using special 3M tape.

Design engineer Brian Conti, from Charlotte, North Carolina, US, came up with the idea.

The 46-year-old said: 'The idea came through observing a problem - specifically what to do about my crowded fridge.

'The introduction of a six-pack or 12-pack of bottled beverages into my fridge usually creates space havoc.

'After some thought, it was obvious that there was a lot of unused space at the top of my refrigerator.

'I have many of my magnets on the side of my fridge in my kitchen.

'One day after opening a bottle, the cap fell to the floor under a cabinet.

'I grabbed a magnet to retrieve the cap and the idea popped into my head. This lead to experimenting then prototyping - and bottleLoft was born.

'I had experience with using magnets from my previous projects and the idea of magnetically 'hanging' bottles up out of the way was formed.'

Mr Conti initially used standard magnets before using custom ones to make the product more secure.
