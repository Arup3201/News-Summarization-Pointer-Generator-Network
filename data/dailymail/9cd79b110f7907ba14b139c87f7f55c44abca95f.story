Leeroy Reed was released on bail until the end of the month

A star of MTV's reality television show The Valleys has been arrested on suspicion of rape.

Leeroy Reed, 21, was arrested at around 9am on New Year's Day following an allegation of a sex assault at a hotel in Croydon, South London, the night before.

He had appeared at Shooshh nightclub in Croydon on New Year's Eve.Â 

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'We were called at 9.30am to reports of an allegation of rape at a Croydon hotel earlier that day.

'It's being investigated by officers from our Sapphire team.

'He was taken to a south London police station and subsequently bailed to return on a date in late January.'

He was bailed until the end of the month.

His agent said he expects the case to be dropped, according to the Daily Mirror.

An MTV spokesman told the paper: 'We take allegations like these very seriously and will continue to follow any investigation very closely.'

The Valleys launched in September last year and follows 11 people plucked from their rural homes to share a house in Cardiff.

Aspiring urban music star Reed, from Bridgend, said he wanted to be Wales' next big urban sensation and claims to have slept with over 100 women.

In the show he is regularly shown flirting with women in the shared house and while out clubbing.
