Pep Guardiola returns to the Champions League on Wednesday night, with a new-look Bayern Munich team, designed to exorcise the ghosts of last season.

After the humiliating 5-0 aggregate defeat to Real Madrid in last year’s semi-final, the initial diagnosis was psychological. Bayern had rested on their laurels after winning the Bundesliga in record time over a month previously, and even Guardiola admitted that he had been too emotional in preparing his players for the clash.

But there were also on-field issues to consider. Bayern, not used to conceding goals, had been run ragged on the counter attack. They had failed to use possession like they normally did, and were unable to find even the slightest gap in a less than impenetrable Real defence. Tactics and personnel at Bayern needed a rethink.

Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola has been forced into a tactical rethink after seeing his side capitulate

Since then, Guardiola has set about revitalising his team’s make-up and tactical approach. First off, he launched into the transfer market. With Robert Lewandowski already secured, the main issue was bolstering the defence, particularly after the injuries suffered in that area. Left back Juan Bernat was brought in from Valencia, Mehdi Benatia from Roma, and, of course, Xabi Alonso from Real Madrid.

Alonso is perhaps the most significant in terms of the fallout from Real. Bayern’s susceptibility on the counter attack is hugely reduced by his presence. It is hard to imagine, meanwhile, that the team would have capitulated so poorly had they had his experience and cool head on their side against Real.

Nonetheless, he is a quick fix. The reason Bayern chose to prise Alonso away from Real, rather than Sami Khedira, was that the signing was always to be a short-term solution, designed to allow the space to develop for young midfielders Gianluca Gaudino, Pierre-Emil Hojbjerg and Lucas Scholl.

Most important in Guardiola’s mini-revolution, however, have been the tactical changes. In the past few months, he has put paid to the idea that he is a man without a Plan B. He has laughed in the face of the critics who say he has one formation and one style: tiki-taka. There have been mixed results.

The first innovation was to revert to three at the back. Guardiola first showcased this approach during the German Cup Final against Dortmund in May. This was a 3-4-2-1, with Arjen Robben spearheading the Bayern attack, and it worked a dream. Bayern won 2-0, and exorcised a few of the ghosts of Real.

The back-three experiment, designed as much as anything to allow Phillipp Lahm to play in his favoured midfield role, has developed since then.

 It was ineffective in pre-season, and while the 3-4-2-1 saw them past Preussen Munster in the Cup, Bayern were forced to revert to four at the back for their first three Bundesliga games. Injury to Javi Martinez meant that Lahm was needed once more in defence, with him and Juan Bernat assuming classic full back positions in a 4-2-3-1.

That changed dramatically this weekend at Stuttgart, with Guardiola forming what could best be described as a 3-1-3-1-2, though that scarcely explains it. 

A back three opened out into the midfield diamond of Alonso, Lahm, Alaba and Gotze, while Bernat and Thomas Muller were given free rein on the wings, with Lewandowski up front. It brought a 2-0 victory.

Bernat’s role has been instrumental to Guardiola’s change. With Toni Kroos having left, the versatile David Alaba has slotted into his attacking midfield role, leaving Bernat to fill the gap at left back. 

Despite Kroos’ quality, Bayern almost appear more flexible without him on paper. Alaba and Bernat, when on form, can synchronise on the left, with both as good in defence as in attack. it means that even without Franck Ribery, Bayern remain extremely dangerous on the overlap.

The back-three is still a work in progress for Bayern, which, alongside injuries and fatigue, goes a long way to explaining their indifferent start to the season. But Guardiola’s tinkering is not merely academic. It is the revitalisation of a system, designed to make Bayern much more flexible in attack, and more importantly, much less susceptible to counter attacking in defence.

Lahm’s words at Tuesday’s press conference said a great deal. 'If we press the ball well, and are organised in defence, and attack from that basis, (then we can outplay City)'.

Last year at Bayern, they were all talking about possession. This year it is more complex. It is more focused on a defensive stability. The world, and Manchester City tonight, have Real Madrid to thank for that.
