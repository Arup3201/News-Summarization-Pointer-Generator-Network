Having built a giant Dalek last Christmas, Lego fans Catherine Weightman and Michael Addis wondered how they could possibly go one better this year.

The answer was this 10ft festive version of the Olympic mascot Wenlock, which almost touches the ceiling of their home in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire.

They used 150,000 bricks – all of which must be put away in the right boxes come Twelfth Night.

Mr Addis, 54, and Miss Weightman, 49, spent two months building the giant Wenlock, which is the latest in a long line of creations over the past 20 years.

They spent more than 70 hours constructing the giant mascot, complete with Santa costume, which is now standing in their living room.

Miss Weightman said: 'We started building it in mid-October and we’ve spent at least an hour a day working on it.

'We watched the Olympics in the summer and we enjoyed it so much we decided to use the mascot for our theme this year and add a Christmas coat.

'We had a soft toy Wenlock which we used to design the model and we added an FC instead of a W on his head.'

The couple and their children Tom, 20, Holly, 17 and Christopher, 14, have been building huge Lego models at Christmas for the last two decades.

Early days: The family have been making Lego models each year since Tom (pictured left with sister Holly, right) was a baby, including this snowman built in 1995

Over the years the models have become increasingly complex, including last year's Dalek, left, and the Nutcracker, right, built in 2005

It's that time of year again: In 1996 the family built this Father Christmas sleigh

They started the year Tom was born and a family friend came to visit with a young child.

Miss Weightman said: 'I got my old box of Lego out for the toddler to play with but the pieces were too small so the adults ended up playing instead and we built our first Christmas model.'

Since then the models have got bigger each year and the family has built a Christmas stocking, a Father Christmas, an angel, a snowman, choirboys and  a giant Dalek.

They now have a huge collection of Lego, much of which they have bought from eBay, and it is all stored in the cellar.

Miss Weightman said: 'On the twelfth night after Christmas we invite friends round and have a packing away party as all the pieces need to go in the right boxes.

'It can take around two weeks to put all the bricks away again.'

Dedication: Each year the family has built an impressive model, including this large mansion created in 2000
