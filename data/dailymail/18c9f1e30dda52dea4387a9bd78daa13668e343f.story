A Seattle baby can be seen running around the city, perching atop buildings and performing some impressive stunts in a clever photo series created by his doting father. 

Seattle-based photographer Brandon Hill conceives and executes the images of his one-year-old son Maddex's acrobatic adventures, with the help of a little Photoshop, as a part of his ongoing picture series Madd Stunts.

'This series is all about him blending in with the city, having fun at local tourist spots, and doing stunts,' Mr Hill told the Huffington Post of the pictures, which capture his adorable son flying behind a speeding moped and hanging from trees.

New skill: One-year-old Maddex can be seen walking across the length of his crib in this photo taken by his photographer father Brandon Hill as a part of his picture series Madd Stunts

Over the edge: With the help of a little Photoshop, Mr Hill made it look as though Maddex was perched on top of his play chair

The photographer explained that all of photos in the series were taken in Seattle, a city he said that he will always 'cherish' because it is where he and his wife had their son.

Maddex can be seen getting into precarious situations at Pike Market, Kerry Park and Seattle's famous gum wall among other locations and neighborhoods across the city.

He has been photographed doing a handstand on the kitchen counter, tight-rope walking on the ledge of his crib and stuck to a wall littered with gum.

Mr Hill has been working on the project, which celebrated his son's childhood, for several months. 

Held up: Maddex blew a bubble as he hung from Seattle's famous gum wall 

Daredevil: The adorable baby was also photographed holding on to a speeding moped

When he first started, Maddex was unable to walk and had to be probbed up by Mr Hill's assistant, who would later be edited out of the image.

Mr Hill told Feature Shoot that when Maddex became nine months old he started 'sharing playful expressions while remaining quiet and still' during the playful photoshoots.

And the pictures are so good that at least one person thinks that they are actual depictions of Maddex's amazing feats.

After Mr Hill shared a photo of Maddex 'balanced' on top of his baby chair on his Instagram page, one concerned commenter wrote: 'Is [that] baby really standing like that? Because that is idiot parenting.'

Sheer strength: Maddex used one hand to hang from a tree in the park 

Budding gymnast: Maddex used upper body strength to do a handstand on the kitchen counter

Mr Hill jokingly replied: 'Yep, cause he's amazing.'

But the exchange didn't stop there.

When the commenter noted that Maddex's balancing act was 'extremely dangerous', Mr Hill let her in on his secret.

'Photoshop: endangering children everywhere,' he wrote.  

Admiring the view: He happily hung out on the roof of Seattle's Public Market 

Precious moment: Mr Hill cuddled up to his son for this adorable father-son photo
