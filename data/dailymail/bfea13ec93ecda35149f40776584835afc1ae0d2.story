Swearing has been banned in films, television and music in Russia after the lower house of parliament passed a new law.

Russian President Vladimir Putin must sign the new edict into law but last year he agreed to a similar ban on foul language in the media.

The new rule means that some of Russia’s best known actors and singers could be fined or even banned from working if they flout the law.

Russian rocker Yuri Shevchuk who challenged President Putin on free speech in 2010 claimed that the law is part of a Conservative trend in the country and could ‘devolve into a dark age’.

He said: ‘I’m against all bans. I’m against all government interference in arts. We have these bans within each of us, in our morality. They’re formed by upbringing and religion.’

The fines start at 2,500 roubles (£41) for individuals and rise to 100,000 roubles (£1,600) for businesses. Repeat offenders could be banned for a year.

Videos, audio tapes and books that contain swearwords will be required to be sold in special packaging featuring an explicit language warning.

Critics point out that there is no firm definition for what constitutes bad language, a similar problem that faced the law that President Putin passed last year.

The law states that ‘words and phrases not meeting the norms of modern Russian literary language’ will be outlawed. A group of ‘experts’ will determine what those words and phrases are.

It remains unclear if films and television shows that bleep out rude words would fall foul of the ban.In recent years swearing has become more prominent in Russian films and plays.

Media companies have already faced difficulties with the ban and the news agency Rosbalt was briefly closed after It aired two videos that included swearing.
