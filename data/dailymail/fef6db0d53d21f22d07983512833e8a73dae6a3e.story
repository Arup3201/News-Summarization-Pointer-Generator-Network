Questions: Dianne Abbott, the shadow health minister, asked whether teenage girls should be given breast reduction operations

Hundreds of teenage girls have had breast reduction operations on the NHS, figures have revealed.

The procedure has been branded a waste of taxpayers' money as they are usually requested for cosmetic reasons.

Over the last six years, 647 girls aged 15 to 18 have had the surgery carried out on the NHS.

The total cost to the taxpayer is around £3.2million - with each operation costing £5,000.

Official NHS guidance says the operation can be carried out if women suffer psychological distress, backache, neck pain or poor posture.

During the procedure surgeons remove, fat, glandular tissue and skin before re-shaping the breasts. The nipples also have to be repositioned.

The operation cannot be carried out for purely cosmetic reasons under NHS rules.

Official figures revealed that 359 women aged in their 70s also had the operation carried out between 2006 and 2011, The Sun reported.

In total, 21,328 women had breast reduction surgery carried out by the NHS over the period.

The figures included 14 girls aged 15 who had breast reductions, 81 girls aged 16, 206 aged 17 and 346 18-year-olds.

Breast reduction op: American teenager Hannah Olson, 19, who had surgery to go from a 36DDD to 34C. Before undergoing the procedure she had been unable to do sports

In addition, there were 358 19-year-olds who had the procedure carried out.

Shadow health minister Diane Abbott questioned whether the NHS should be funding the operations.

'An obsession with physical perfection is driving women,' she told The Sun.

'Society needs to debate whether scarce NHS resources are best spent on a 15-year-old who has convinced herself her breasts are too big?'
