Reflections from the eyes of child sex abuse victims in digital photographs could be used by police to catch paedophiles.

According to new research from two UK universities, the images of people reflected in the victim's eye can be identified with the help of advanced camera technology.

The eye's pupil acts like a mirror in which the images of people standing behind the photographer are caught.

The breakthrough means that unseen 
bystanders who witnessed a crime could now be identified once the 
high-resolution photographs are magnified.

Psychologists
 at the University of York and the University of Glasgow were able to 
extract such images and zoom in on them so that the subjects could be 
identified by third parties.

Lead
 researcher Dr Rob Jenkins said: ‘The pupil of the eye is like a black 
mirror. Eyes in the photographs could reveal where you were and who you 
were with.'

Dr Jenkins said it was possible to ‘mine face photographs for hidden information' including witnesses, bystanders and locations.

In
 the study, Dr Jenkins and the University of Glasgow's Christie Kerr 
photographed eight individuals, who were looking at four people behind 
the camera.

The reflected 
faces were then cropped and magnified and subjects were asked to either 
match the images to mug shots or to identify the faces that they knew.

Identifiable: The faces of individuals in the photograph can be seen by zooming in on the image

The
 study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, found test subjects were able
 to spot the reflections of familiar faces 84 per cent of the time.

When the reflected images were of 
unfamiliar people, observers were able to match the person to a mug shot
 with 71 per cent accuracy.

The
 researchers said they were surprised to discover that even unfamiliar 
faces are distinguishable despite the poor quality of the images.

The
 quality of images of reflected faces is about 30,000 times lower than a
 face that was directly captured in the same photograph.

The researchers suggested this 
technique could become a crucial part in investigating criminal cases 
where in which victims are photographed, including hostage-taking and 
child abuse.

But for the 
technique to work the photos has to be shot in high-resolution and the 
subject must be looking directly at the camera.

The subject's face must be in focus and well lit to for their eyes to give a clear reflection.

Researchers
 said that if images were available from both eyes, a 3D image could be 
constructed showing what the subject saw when the photo was taken.
