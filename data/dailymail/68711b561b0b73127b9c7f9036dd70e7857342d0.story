This was the spectacular sight over Fistral Beach in Newquay today, as a double rainbow appeared to rise out of the sea and arch over the seaside town.

The stunning picture, taken this morning, was taken shortly after a sudden shower on the Cornish beach, which is popular with surfers even during the colder months.

The rain is likely to be the last seen in the south-west for the next few days, with forecasters predicting clear skies but freezing temperatures through to Bonfire Night.

There was an equally stunning view over Windermere in the Lake District this morning, as the sun painted the sky a mural of reds and oranges

Walkers braved the rain at Friars Cliff in Dorset as they strolled past the beach's colourful huts, but clearer skies are expected tomorrow, according to the Met Office

Showers tonight will ease off, leaving clear skies for Dorset and the rest of the nation, with just a few brief showers expected in the north-west and Wales

Overnight showers will ease tomorrow morning with clear skies expected for most of the country, other than a few brief showers in the north-west and Wales, the Met Office said.

Freezing temperatures will accompany the blue skies, however, with frosts predicted for the north of England and swathes of Scotland.

Forecasters said the weather would be great for watching fireworks, but warned people planning on going out on Bonfire Night to wrap up warm.

A Met Office spokesman said: 'There will be fewer showers and clear spells from tomorrow morning so temperatures may drop to 5C in towns and cities.

'There will be the odd shower in the north-west and Wales, but the best weather will be seen in the east of the country.

'Temperatures in Scotland will drop tomorrow evening and freezing temperatures are expected. These cold temperatures will be particularly felt in higher areas. In more exposed areas there may be a frost.

The rainy weather is expected to have cleared away for Bonfire Night, which should be clear but chilly for most of Britain

The warm weather that brought the roses into bloom is likely to be over for the rest of the year, with clear but cold weather drawing in for at least the next few days

'Wednesday will be the best day of the week. There will be showers in the south-east but otherwise it will be dry and fine.

'It could be cool on Bonfire Night but it should be clear. We're not talking polar conditions but it will be quite chilly.Â 

'You should be wearing gloves if you're holding sparklers anyway, but it will be that kind of evening. In the north it will be particularly cold.'

Today's dismal weather did not deter dog walkers at Highcliffe, in Dorset, where winds whipped up crashing waves and heavy rain lashed the pebbly bay.

It was far brighter in Bristol today, wear the prolonged warm weather over Autumn has brought roses out in bloom.
