A junior doctor was 'out of his depth' when he operated on a pregnant woman who died after her ovary was removed by mistake, a tribunal heard today.

Yahya Al-Abed said he felt 'confident' and 'capable' enough to perform the complicated procedure on Maria De Jesus, 32, at Queen's Hospital, Romford, Essex, after she was admitted with appendicitis.

The fifth-year trainee surgeon, who had worked at the hospital for less than three weeks, has admitted making a series of errors and now acknowledges he did not have enough experience when he performed surgery on October 23, 2011.

The mother-of-three died on the operating table 19 days later after suffering a miscarriage and undergoing a second procedure to remove her appendix.

Senior surgical consultant, Dr Babatunde Julian Coker, has admitted failing in his role by not attending theatre to carry out the surgery himself or supervising the registrar.

But his defence barrister, Neil Sheldon, has accused junior surgeons of keeping Mr Coker 'in the dark' in order to conduct the 'interesting and rare' operation themselves.

Both doctors are facing fitness to practise proceedings at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester, where they could face being struck off the medical register if the panel decide their actions amounted to misconduct.

In his written statement to the General Medical Council, Mr Al-Abed said he 'felt confident' but now 'readily acknowledges he was out of his depth'.

Giving evidence, the medic added: 'At that time I felt I was capable to do this operation having done so many appendectomies, both supervised and unsupervised - that it's within my capabilities.

'Clearly this is not the case because I didn't have enough experience to operate on a pregnant woman.'

The panel has heard that Mr Coker, the on-duty consultant, was in the coffee room while the surgery took place, but did not know the operation had occurred until he returned to work the next morning.

Dr Yahya Al-Abed, a fifth-year trainee, had only been at the hospital for three weeks

Junior medics Osman Chaudhary and Christopher Liao, who are not facing charges, along with Mr Al-Abed, have been accused of deliberately withholding information from their boss.

Mr Sheldon suggested to Mr Al-Abed: 'The truth of the matter is not that you didn't need supervision. It was really that you didn't want supervision for this operation.

'You didn't want him to be there did you? You wanted to do this interesting and rare surgery while unsupervised didn't you?

'And there was a deliberate decision from the very outset, including you, that Mr Coker wouldn't be told what his junior team were doing in this case.'

Mr Al-Abed denied the allegation and explained he thought it was his 'duty' to conduct the operation as he was responsible for conducting emergency surgeries over that weekend.

He even allowed second-year trainee Mr Chaudhary to begin the surgery after he asked to help, despite not being on duty and never having operated on a pregnant woman before.

'It was hard for me to refuse that. That help is always required, particularly on weekends because we are thin on weekends, Mr Al-Abed added.

The tribunal has heard how Mrs De Jesus was admitted to hospital with severe abdominal pain on October 21, 2011, and was diagnosed with appendicitis two days later.

Mrs De Jesus, who was 21-weeks pregnant, was told she needed an appendectomy and was added to Mr Al-Abed's list.

During the procedure she began to bleed heavily and 'in the midst' of the bleeding the medic removed what he thought to be her appendix.

Mrs De Jesus' condition failed to improve after the mistake was noticed and she died on the operating table at Queens Hospital, Romford, during a second operation 19 days later

Mrs De Jesus was discharged ten days after the Sunday October 23 operation, but returned to the Romford hospital on November 7, still in serious pain.

Another doctor discovered that it was in fact her right ovary that had been removed instead of her appendix. She gave birth to a still-born boy and died on the operating table on November 11 following a second operation to remove the organ, the tribunal heard.

The post-mortem concluded she had died of multiple organ failure brought on by septicaemia, the panel heard. Mr Coker, represented by Neil Sheldon, admits to failing to appropriately undertake his role in not attending or supervising the operation, but denies several other similar charges on the basis that his admission 'renders them redundant'.

Mr Al-Abed, represented by David Morris, has admitted failing to inform the consultant, involving a junior doctor in the operation without having the experience to supervise him and removing the patient's ovary in error, leaving two outstanding factual matters for the panel to decide.

The GMC do not allege that any of the doctors' failings led to their patient's death. If the panel, chaired by Carrie Ryan-Palmer, find any of the facts admitted or found proved amount to misconduct the medics could face sanctions ranging from conditions to erasure from the medical register.

Recording a narrative verdict, an inquest in Walthamstow, east London, coroner Chinyere Inyama said a lost window of opportunity could have saved Mrs De Jesus. Barking, Havering and Redbridge Hospitals Trust admitted liability for her death apologised to her family.

The hearing continues.
