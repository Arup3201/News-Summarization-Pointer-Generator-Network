Arsenal left it late to stage a dramatic comeback against Anderlecht and keep their Champions League hopes on track.

The Gunners were heading for a shock loss after Andy Najar opened the scoring for the hosts in the 71st minute but a Kieran Gibbs equaliser and a Lukas Podolski strike completed the turnaround in the dying embers of the match.

Emiliano Martinez was superb in goal for Arsene Wenger's side as the third-choice goalkeeper made his European debut.

Here Sportsmail's Rob Draper gives his verdict on how the players performed.

Arsenal (4-3-3) 

Emiliano Martinez - 8.5 - STAR MAN

Superb night with no nerves and he kept Arsenal in the game. 

Emiliano Martinez had a sublime goal in for Arsenal - in only his third appearance for the club

Calum Chambers - 6.5

Bad night but provided a great cross for Kieran Gibbs' equaliser. 

Per Mertesacker - 6.5

Kept defence together in the first half but was less successful in second.

Nacho Monreal - 6, 

Satisfactory performance, given that he’s out of position at centre-back.

Kieran Gibbs - 7 

At fault for goal, but what a finish for the equaliser! 

Kieran Gibbs started Arsenal's dramatic comeback scoring a beautiful volley with minutes remaining

Aaron Ramsey - 5.5 

Struggled in his first start back for the Gunners from injury.

Mathieu Flamini - 5.5 

Organised things as well he could but little impact otherwise on midfield.

Jack Wilshere - 5.5

Passing awry, the midfield couldn’t get a grip of the game. 

Alexis Sanchez was full of energy as the Gunners clawed their way back into the match

Alexis Sanchez - 6.5 

Always energetic, always showing: vital contribution for the winner. 

Danny Welbeck - 6 

Started well but faded away, as Arsenal lost control of the game.

Santi Cazorla - 5.5

Not his greatest night: peripheral, missed 64th minute chance.

Santi Cazorla was largely ineffectual for the English side against Anderlecht on Wednesday night

Substitutes  

Joel Campbell (76, for Welbeck) - 5.5 

Couldn’t really make an impact on the game

Lukas Podolski (84, for Wilshere) - 8 

Superb. Just when Arsenal needed him, he popped up

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (76 for Flamini) - 7

Eventually found those driving runs to trouble Anderlecht 

Lukas Podolski produced a stellar substitute appearance - scoring the Gunners' winner late on
