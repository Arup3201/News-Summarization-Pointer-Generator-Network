Bad cop: Florida sheriff's deputy Ted Arboleda, 32 (pictured), was arrested on Monday after it was revealed he accepted oral sex in exchange for letting a woman off on a driving without a license charge

A  Florida sheriff's deputy was arrested Monday, after it was revealed he accepted oral sex from a woman who he could have arrested for driving without a license, drug possession and violating her parole.

Broward County Sheriff's Deputy Ted Arboleda, 32, allegedly chatted up a local woman on July 13, 2013, at a Mobil gas station. 

During their conversation, Arboleda discovered that the woman did not have a valid license, despite driving a car to the gas station.

He also found that she was in possession of marijuana, an unlabeled bottle of prescription medication and on felony probation. 

Fearing arrest, the woman  bribed the officer with money to avoid legal action. 

But apparently that wasn't necessary, as Arboleda reportedly let the unidentified woman keep her drugs and even offered to drive her home.

When they arrived at the woman's Dania Beach house, Arboleda asked if he was going to be invited in and the woman agreed. 

Inside, she offered Arboleda oral sex, and while he accepted, he allegedly said he had never done anything like that before. 

He said 'he could not believe he agreed' and swore her to secrecy.  He left without arresting her. 

But that same day, the woman's boyfriend called the sheriff's office to report the incident, and Arboleda has been under investigation ever since. He was put on administrative duty on August 19 of this year before his October 13 arrest.

Arboleda has been at the sheriff's department since February 2011, when he voluntarily left the Surfside Police Department after two years of service.

On Monday he was held at Broward Mail Jail on $1,000 bond, after being charged with unlawful compensation or reward for official behavior -  a second-degree felony.

The sheriff's public corruption unit continues to investigate the incident. 

'There's a possibility that he's done this before,' sheriff's office spokesman Dani Moschella said.

Anyone who may have been a victim of Arboleda is being asked to call the Broward Sheriff's internal affairs office at 954-321-1100. 

Scene: Arboleda allegedly met the woman at this Mobil gas station. and discovered that in addition to being on felony probation, the woman did not have a license to drive and was in possession of marijuana and unmarked prescription medication. He then drove her home, and asked to be invited inside where the woman eventually offered him oral sex
