For 25 years, she dedicated herself to educating children.

A passionate teacher, Marion Potts proudly pinned her pupils’ work to her classroom walls.

She had no idea this simple gesture was exposing her to asbestos that would eventually lead to her death.

Marion Potts was head of English at The Romsey School, in Hants,but retired two years ago due to ill health

The 63-year-old, who had worked at 
numerous schools across the country and abroad, died in June from 
mesothelioma, a cancer associated with the toxic substance.

An
inquest heard the only place she could have been exposed to it was at 
school, where it can be released from walls in older buildings when 
displays are put up with drawing pins.

Mrs
Potts, known to friends as Jane, is one of more than 140 UK teachers to
die from mesothelioma over the past decade, leading to calls to remove 
asbestos from schools. At her inquest in Southampton, coroner Keith 
Wiseman said: ‘Mrs Potts particularly mentioned a variety of occasions –
such as basic matters like putting up a display with drawing pins – 
where this material would come out of the walls or when they were 
damaged by pupils.’

Recording
a verdict of death from industrial disease, Mr Wiseman added: ‘I hope 
all the necessary steps are taken in the future to ensure the 
elimination of this substance.’

Marion Potts last worked at Romsey School in Hampshire which has been declared safe by Hampshire County Council. It is not known where she was exposed to asbestos

Marion Potts was head of English at The Romsey School and was described as 'passionate' and 'caring'

The
inquest heard it was not known at which school the teacher was exposed 
to asbestos. She retired from her most recent position as the head of 
English at The Romsey School, in Hampshire, two years ago after falling 
ill. Before that she worked at the New Forest Academy in Holbury. But 
education bosses insist that both Hampshire schools where Mrs Potts 
worked are safe.

Only last 
year an all-party Parliamentary group warned that 75 per cent of schools
nationwide expose children and staff to asbestos. Mrs Potts’ husband 
Michael, 63, a retired banker, called for it to be removed from schools 
immediately and said he was considering legal action.

Around 2,500 people died from asbestos related illnesses in the UK in 2008 with millions thought to be affected

He
added: ‘You usually associate the disease with dockers or those working
in industrial jobs, not teachers. These buildings are 50 years old and 
asbestos will come out because kids are always running around, banging 
into things and people stick things into the wall. She was never made 
aware of these dangers.’

Former colleagues described Mrs Potts as ‘dedicated and passionate’.

Jonathan
de Sausmarez, executive head at The Romsey School, said: ‘Jane was a 
very good teacher, very thorough and very professional. She cared very 
much for the students.’

Hampshire
County Council leader Roy Perry said the authority had been ‘managing’ 
asbestos in schools since 1997. He  added: ‘We inspected all 
asbestos-containing materials at the New Forest Academy in August and 
can reassure staff, governors, parents and pupils that the school site 
is safe.

‘Romsey School 
will have been checked by the council from 2005 onwards, prior to 
becoming an academy, and it would have received a clean bill of health 
as we are not aware of any problem there.’

Asbestos
was widely used in the UK as a building material up until 1985 when the
use of most types was banned. It was completely banned from new 
buildings in 1999.

The toxic
material is closely associated with Second Consortium of Local 
Authorities schools, which are prefab buildings developed as a temporary
measure in the 1960s in response to the baby boom.

National
Union of Teachers  representative Pete Sopowski said: ‘There’s a huge 
problem in schools. It’s a case of which schools don’t have it rather 
than which do.’
