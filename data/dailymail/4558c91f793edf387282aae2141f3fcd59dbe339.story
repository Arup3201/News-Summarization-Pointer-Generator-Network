A major security operation was required to get Angelina Jolie and William Hague to the airport for a UN mission today, with a police motorcycle convoy and screens to shield the pair from prying eyes.

The unlikely duo had met in Downing Street to discuss tackling rape in war zones, before flying out to Bosnia and Herzegovina to meet victims.

But before they even reached Sarajevo the pair were the focus of an intense police effort, worthy of one of Miss Jolie's films, complete with black screens, security guards and a number of police officers to get her across London safely - and away from the eyes of the public.

The actress, a Special Envoy of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, was taken from her London hotel in a black Government car to Downing Street for a meeting with Mr Hague.

Accompanied by a police convoy, including motorcycles and unmarked police cars, she and the MP were taken to an airport, where they boarded a private plane for Bosnia and Herzegovinia.

Miss Jolie, who is known for her humanitarian work, spent around 12 hours in the UK, arriving on Wednesday night when she attended a drinks reception, followed by dinner with Mr Hague at his offices.

The Metropolitan police refused to 
comment on the specific security arrangements of Miss Jolie's visit but a
 spokesman told mailOnline: 'We never discuss specifics of security but 
if Miss Jolie was with Government officials as part of her UN duties, 
that would explain a police presence.'

Last year Miss Jolie and Mr Hague travelled together to  the Democratic Republic of Congo, where they met survivors of rape.

Their visit to Sarajevo comes ten weeks ahead of the three-day Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, which they will chair in London in June.

In November Mr Hague pledged funding of more than £250,000 over 
three years to the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the 
Department of Field Support to develop training as first responders to 
rape and sexual violence.

Speaking of their mission to Bosnia, Mr Hague said: 'Tens of thousands of women, girls and men were raped during the war in Bosnia.

'We are visiting to draw the world’s attention to their search for justice, and to call for global action to end the use of rape as a weapon of war once and for all.

Jetting off: Miss Jolie and Mr Hague will meet victims of sexual violence from the war in Bosnia, which ran between 1992 and 1995

'In
 London in ten weeks’ time we will be asking nations around the world to
 make that decisive commitment, so that from Bosnia to the DRC survivors
 get the justice they need, and future mass rape can be prevented.

'We can and must change the entire global attitude to these crimes, and shatter the culture of impunity.'

Miss Jolie and Mr Hague will meet survivors of sexual violence from the war in Bosnia, which ran between 1992 and 1995, as well as judges and prosecutors in the country who are working to address the huge backlog of sexual violence cases.

Injustice: Miss Jolie described the use of rape as a weapon of war as 'one of the great injustices of our time'

They will also speak at a regional 
military conference of ministers and senior officers, as well as meeting
 with political leaders to discuss the challenges and opportunities facing Bosnia.

Miss Jolie added: 'We are here to meet victims of the war in Bosnia, female and male survivors of rape who carry a terrible burden.

'The use of rape as a weapon of war is one of the great injustices of our time. For too long the world has tolerated these crimes, and left survivors to struggle in the shadows.

'Our goal is to bring forward the voices of the survivors of these crimes and to ask the world to stand with them and against impunity.'

Miss Jolie's long-term involvement with humanitarian projects led to her her being appointed a Special Envoy of UN High Commissioner for Refugees by António Guterres in April 2012.
