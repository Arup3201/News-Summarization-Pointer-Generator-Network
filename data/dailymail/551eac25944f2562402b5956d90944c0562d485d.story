A teenager hanged herself after becoming convinced the world would end in 2012 after researching doomsday scenarios on the internet, an inquest heard.

Schoolgirl Isabel Taylor, 16, turned to Buddhism after becoming fed up with the 'complications and injustice' of the modern world.

But while searching for answers she began researching doomsday scenarios - becoming convinced a nuclear reactor meltdown would end civilisation in the coming months.

Isabel Taylor, 16, hanged herself after becoming convinced the world would end in 2012

She had researched on the internet how to overdose but was found hanged in her bedroom by her mother.

Yesterday her parents Gary, 51, and Ingrid, 48, said in a statement: 'We have questioned and searched our hearts to try to find an answer to why Isabel went down this devastating path.

'She yearned for an uncomplicated and perfect world where every living thing would be valued and at peace.

'But the simple and perfect world she sought, where all living things would be treated with compassion and equality, was never going to materialise.

'Unfortunately the future for her in her eyes must have seemed very bleak.

'Sadly there were too many bad points for her to contend with and the lure to opt out was too compelling.

'We can only conclude that she wasn't prepared to adjust to adulthood with all the complications, injustice and, for her, unhappiness that came with it.'

The couple, of Neston, Wiltshire, said Isabel had begun making flippant remarks that the world would end soon.

Mr Taylor, a retired civil servant, said: 'We were aware of the 2012 issue. She would mention it around the dinner table.

'We would take it on board and say we didn't think that was going to happen Isabel, and try to make light of it and move conversation onwards.

Isabel's parents Gary, 51, and Ingrid, 48, said they believe their daughter was unable to cope with the 'complications and injustice' of adulthood

'She would flippantly say "oh but it's all going to end next year anyway" and we would try and laugh it off.

'She believed something was going to happen that would change the world, I'm not sure whether she ever fully believed that it was going to end, but she definitely thought something was going to happen.

'She read articles on all different types of things which could make the world end, she read about 15 to 20 articles over the course of 2011 with her best friend.

'The most recent one she read was on sun spots and how if they went wrong it could cause a nuclear reaction.'

Increasing numbers of websites devoted to 2012 doomsday scenarios have sprung up online, centred on claims the Mayans believed this is the year the world will end.

In France a tiny village named Bugarach has seen visits from doomsday devotees, claiming it will survive any apocalypse event.

The inquest at Trowbridge Town Hall, Wiltshire, heard how Isabel was concerned about 'injustices' in the world and had converted to Buddhism in Spring 2011.

The committed vegan had just started studying animal science and management at Wiltshire College and was a passionate animal rights campaigner who ran a guinea pig sanctuary with a friend.

Her parents said: 'Isabel was a fully committed vegan and had very strong views on animal welfare especially animal testing, livestock and dairy farming.

'In the spring of 2011 she turned to the Buddhist faith and their teachings to search for answers because she could relate in their beliefs and principles.

'It would seem her belief in Buddhism and the possibility of another, better life was strong enough to persuade her that the time was right to move on to what comes next.'

The inquest heard how Mrs Taylor, found her daughter hanged in her room at their home at 3.15pm in September last year, after spending much of the night on the computer.

Mr Taylor added: 'We will never understand why she took her life and we will never fully come to terms with it.

'We miss her greatly , it was a tragic incident, she had such a promising career ahead of herself.

'The enormous shock of it remains with us and we will never fully come to terms with it.

'She managed to hide what was going on inside her mind because outwardly the happy, bubbly Isabel we knew and loved so well was what she portrayed to us until the end.'

Assistant deputy Wiltshire Coroner Claire Balsyz, recorded a verdict that Isabel had taken her own life while the balance of her mind was disturbed.
