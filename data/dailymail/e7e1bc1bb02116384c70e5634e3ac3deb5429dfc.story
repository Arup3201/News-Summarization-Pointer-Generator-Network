Success comes in many shapes and sizes, but some people continually seem to achieve, while others fail.

And now scientists have found that success really does breed success – at least up to a point.

They discovered that people who receive help early on in their endeavours and experience a boost in confidence, are often more successful than people who do not receive a helping hand to start with.

Success breeds success:  Scientists found that people who receive help early on in their endeavours and experience a boost in confidence are often more successful than people who do not receive a helping hand to start with

Scientists from University College London and Stony Brook University in New York conducted four experiments that measured the impact of  support – such as a donation or positive endorsement – on subsequent success.

They found that success was more likely to follow initial assistance for crowd-funders on kickstarter.com and that people given an initial donation were around twice as likely to receive further contributions as others who only received funding through standard routes.

They also observed that the granting of a dozen signatures to a randomly selected petition led to a cause attracting further endorsements more often than petitions that did not receive the orchestrated support. However, the magnitude of the support offered had little effect on the outcome.

‘Theoretically, it’s hard to see if the “success breeds success” effect exists - it could be that it reflects genuine ability,' Dr Arnout van de Rijt, of Stony Brook University and lead author of the paper said.

'To tease out where the success comes from, we did experiments that gave artificial help to some people and not others.'

In the first experiment, the researchers donated funding to 100 of 200 new and unfunded projects on kickstarter.com and monitored the level of later funding.

Almost 40 per cent of projects without the initial donation attracted future donations, compared with 70 per cent of those given the 'experimental donation'.

The second experiment involved the website epinions.com, for which reviewers are paid for evaluations of new products according to how helpful website visitors rate their reviews.

A total of nine out of ten reviews that received experimental endorsements were rated as ‘very helpful’ within two weeks of treatment, compared to 77 per cent in the sample without the initial boost.

In the third test, a random sample of the top 1 per cent most productive editors on Wikipedia were given an award.

During the observation period of five months, just under one third of the editors without this start received a status award, whereas 40 per cent of those given an initial status award attracted at least one more award.

The fourth test used the petition website change.org, where people seek support from the general public for social and political goals through electronic signature campaigns.

Interestingly, the scientist found that giving twice as much funding or signatures did not guarantee twice the success.

Dr Soong Moon Kang at UCL said: ‘Our research has implications for the success of initiatives to counter inequality and create a more meritocratic society. It also suggests that these don’t need to be big or costly to help: it’s the initial boost that matters.

‘We also find that interventions have much more effect on those coming from very little.’

Heads down: In a separate study, students who were told that failing an exam would prevent them from finding a good job reported feeling less motivated and performed worse in exams than those given encouragement. Pupils taking a GCSE mathematics exam are pictured

Teachers who use the fear of failure in a bid to get students to knuckle down and revise hard for GCSEs and A Levels may be having a negative effect on their success, according to a new study.

Students who were told that failing an exam would prevent them from finding a good job reported feeling less motivated and performed worse in exams than those given encouragement.

The study, led by Edge Hill University in Lancashire, looked at different styles of pre-exam persuasive messages used by teachers, the impact they can have on students’ motivation and ultimately, their academic performance.

It found that messages that used scare tactics, such as ‘if you fail the exam, you will never be able to get a good job or go to university,’ achieved fewer positive results than messages that focused on success, like ‘the exam is really important as most jobs that pay well require that you pass and if you want to go to college you will also need to pass the exam’.

Students who said they felt threatened by messages that frequently focused on failure reported feeling less motivated and performed worse in their tests than students who reported that their teacher used fewer fear tactics.
