Picture the scenario. Arsenal lose in Istanbul on Tuesday night - only to discover Anderlecht have beaten Borussia Dortmund.

Would Arsene Wenger regret only bringing 11 first-teamers to Turkey with him then?

That, of course, is the worst case scenario facing the Gunners manager as he prepares his side for their final Champions League group clash against Galatasaray.

There is logic behind the Frenchman's decision - but you wonder if the decision will come back to haunt him.

It's true to say finishing top of Group D looks a far-fetched dream, but it looks a dream that Wenger has totally given up on.

Which is strange given Wenger, a man who know his stats, understands the perils of finishing second in a Champions League group.

Over the last 10 years under 29 per cent of teams that finished in the runners-up spot in their respective pool went on to progress to the next round of the knockout phase.

That stat will sound awfully familiar to Wenger and his side.

Having finished second in their group last season, they crashed out in the first knockout round against Bayern Munich.

Twelve months earlier, they fell at the same hurdle, again to the German giants.

History repeated itself in 2011 when - having finished second in a group that included Shakhtar Donetsk, Braga and Partizan Belgrade - they lost to Barcelona in the last 16.

Wenger, with that in mind, will be keeping his fingers crossed his side avoid one of Europe's superpowers in the next round of the tournament.

The Frenchman has gone with the odds. To a point, it's understandable.

But imagine how he'd feel if the unthinkable happens and Dortmund do suffer a shock defeat against Anderlecht.

More importantly, imagine how the supporters will feel.

Wenger will have a bench full of unproven youngsters to turn to should it emerge finishing top is on.

'Being top would be nice,' admitted Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.

'But is is not fully in our hands. We are here to win the game and that is what we will be trying to do.

'First of all, they (the youngsters who have travelled) are all boys who play for Arsenal Football Club, which warrants definite respect straight away. They all have quality.

'For all young players, you have to start somewhere, and you have to be challenged at some point, the young lads who are in the squad if they have the chance that is their chance to prove their point and prove they are capable,

'From what I have seen of them, they all have good quality, they are all good lads, up for it and prove to boss that they are good players.

'The boys that have been here before, the more experienced players in the team, it is their responsibility to help the young ones get through the game and cope with it.

'There will definitely be nerves, but the lads that have played for a long time still get nervous, that is normal for them to feel nervous.

'They have just got to go out there if they do play and do what they do week in week out that has got them to this position.'

The vibes towards Wenger from a section of the club's supporters aren't great at the moment - the uncomfortable scenes at Stoke-on-Trent train station on Saturday, when the Frenchman was abused and heckled by his own fans, are testament to that.

Should the unthinkable happen on Tuesday night then it could turn nasty again.

Wenger knows the consequences should things turn out for the worse.

He'll be labelled a fool if Anderlecht defeat Borussia Dortmund only for Arsenal not to keep their end of the bargain.

However, what would Wenger be labelled as if Anderlecht didn't win and Santi Cazorla, Danny Welbeck, Kieran Gibbs or Alexis Sanchez - the four players who aren't carrying injuries but were told to stay in London - were to pick up an injury?

Foolish, right? Particularly when your chances of finishing top of the group were minor.

Wenger, in that sense, is between a rock and a hard place. Does he go for broke - or risk adding to his already lengthy injury list with the busy festive period upon us?

In reality, the team Wenger will play on Tuesday (Szczesny; Debuchy, Mertesacker, Chambers, Bellerin; Flamini, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Ramsey; Campbell, Podolski; Sanogo) is more than capable of winning at Galatasaray.

Their true crime was letting that three-goal lead slip against Anderlecht.

So let's reserve judgement on Wenger's latest call until after Tuesday's clash.
