'Smart drugs' are taken to boost a student's exam results, but they could be having the opposite effect,  warns new research.

A study found some healthy students who took a well-known 'smart drug' noticed their performance impaired by the drug.

Students taking  Modafinil had slower reaction times and were less able to think creatively, scientists discovered.

However, for students lacking a creative spark in the first place, overall performance was found to improve.

Figures suggest one in five students have taken the so-called 'smart' drug Modafinil to boost their ability to study and improve their chances of exam success. 

Modafinil pills keep users alert and awake, increasing their ability to concentrate and process information

They have been proven to improve memory by 10 per cent. 

However, they can have worrying side-effects — including headaches, irritableness, vomiting, irrational behaviour, tremors, palpitations and broken sleeping patterns. 

The study showed it had negative effects in healthy people. 

Doctor Ahmed Dahir Mohamed, of The University of Nottingham, Malaysia Campus, said he didn't expect students taking Modafinil to show slower reaction times.

He said: 'We looked at how the drug acted when you are required to respond accurately and in a timely manner. Our findings were completely opposite to the results we expected.'

The study involved 32 healthy participants taking the drug who were compared to 32 given a placebo.

Modafinil is a prescription-only stimulant used by doctors to treat patients suffering from the sleeping disorder narcolepsy.

Modafinil pills are being sold for as little as 50p each and have been proven to improve memory by 10 per cent. 

They keep users alert and awake, increasing their ability to concentrate and process information.

However, they can have worrying side-effects — including headaches, irritableness, vomiting, irrational behaviour, tremors, palpitations and broken sleeping patterns. 

All took a neuropsychological task known as the Hayling Sentence Completion Test in which they were asked to respond quickly and accurately to tasks.

Dr Mohamed said: 'It has been argued that Modafinil might improve your performance by delaying your ability to respond.

'It has been suggested this 'delay dependent improvement' might improve cognitive performance by making people less impulsive.

'We found no evidence to support those claims. 

'Our research showed that when a task required instant reactions the drug just increased reaction times with no improvement to cognitive performance.'

The findings back up his previous research that showed so called 'smart' drug impaired the participant's ability to respond in a creative way, particularly when they were asked to respond laterally - thinking outside the box.

However, the study did find those who weren't particularly creative to start with, saw their performance increase in problem solving tasks requiring creativity.

The study backs up previous research that suggests the drugs improve people at the lower end of the spectrum in terms of memory, learning, reasoning and problem solving, but impair healthy people who are performing at their optimum level of intelligence.

 Researchers concluded that Modafinil improves the performance of less capable students, but impairs the performance of those who are already performing well academically

He said: 'It looks like Modafinil is not helpful for healthy individuals and it might even impair their ability to respond and might stifle their lateral thinking, while people who have some sort of deficiency in creativity are helped by the drug.

'What I have found in my doctoral studies is that if you are already a healthy person and functioning at an optimum level, it is really difficult to improve your cognition.

'As teenagers' brains are still developing it might be possible to improve their learning through positive interaction with others, healthy diet or mindfulness meditation,' he added.  

The study was published in the journal PLOS ONE.
