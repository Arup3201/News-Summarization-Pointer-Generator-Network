Hero: Reverend Patrick Dowling, pictured, who works with the Diocese of Jefferson County, was the religious figure who appeared at the side of Katie Lentz, 19, after she was injured in a head-on collision on August 4

The mystery priest who anointed a young car crash victim and then vanished before rescue workers could thank him has been identified as Reverend Patrick Dowling who works with the Diocese of Jefferson County, Missouri.

Dowling revealed he was the religious figure who appeared at the side of Katie Lentz, 19, after she was injured in a head-on collision on August 4, in a comment under a story on a Catholic news website on Friday evening, but his confession went largely unnoticed until Monday.

The incredible story went viral as some assumed the mystery priest was an angel or deceased Catholic saint Padre Pio, had persuasive powers of conversion and could heal the sick.

But Dowling, under the article on the National Catholic Register site, explained he was in fact responsible for the apparent divine intervention.

He said he had been filling in for a sick priest at Mass and was on his way home when he came upon the crash scene.

Authorities had closed off the area and were re-routing traffic but Dowling waited until he could get closer.

'I parked behind a large vehicle about 150 yards from the scene. I asked the Sheriff's permission and approached the scene of the accident,' Dowling said. 'I absolved and anointed Katie, and, at her request, prayed that her leg would not hurt. Then I stepped aside to where some rescue personnel and the pilot were waiting, and prayed the rosary silently.'

He said he left the wreckage just as the helicopter was about to leave to take Katie to hospital.

Interestingly, he said he told someone on the scene his name but it must not have been passed on.

He then thanked the hard work of the first responders.

Mangled Wreck: Emergency workers were struggling to save Katie Lentz when she was hit head-on by a drunk driver on Highway 19 near to Center, Missouri

Prayer: When emergency workers could not free her - Katie Lentz asked them to stop so that a prayer could be said

'God has blessed your work. I hope the credit goes where it is due,' he explained.

In a statement to The Blaze, a 
spokesman for the diocese, Deacon Dan Joyce, confirmed Dowling was 
indeed the faith healer responsible.

'Fr.
Dowling said that he is pleased that he was able to help by performing 
his ministry and noted that that he was just one of many who responded 
to assist the victim at the accident,' the statement reads.

'He
and the Diocese wish to acknowledge and thank the first responders, 
medical team and law enforcement personnel for their efforts that 
morning in aid of the young woman injured in the accident.

Fr.
Dowling, a native of Kilkenny, Ireland, was ordained a priest of the 
Diocese of Jefferson City in 1982 and has served at parishes in Moberly,
Monroe City, Indian Creek, Milan, Unionville and Eldon, Missouri, and 
in the diocese’s mission parishes in Marcona and Nasca, Peru.

He is currently serving in prison ministry and in parish ministry to Spanish-speaking Catholics.

Missouri Savior? Many had speculated online that Padre Pio who was said to be blessed with many supernatural powers during his life time was the priest who helped Katie Lentz on Highway 19 on Sunday

Effort: The desperate effort to save Katie Lentz was blessed by the Catholic priest who appeared from nowhere and just as mysteriously vanished

Emergency workers had been battling for an hour and a half to free Lentz after the head on collision, but to no avail.

But
as they joined hands the priest appeared, even though there were no 
bystanders and the road was blocked, who offered a prayer and an 
instruction to the rescuers that they would now be able to free her.

Suddenly, heavy equipment needed to cut 
through the metal arrived from a nearby town and Lentz was pulled from the wreck in time to
be saved - but when they turned to thank Dowling, he was gone.

'He came up and approached the patient, and offered a prayer,' Chief Raymond Reed said of the then-mystery priest to KHQA-TV.

'It was a Catholic priest who had anointing oil with him. A sense of calmness came over her, and it did us as well. 

'I can’t be for certain how it was said, but myself and another firefighter, we very plainly heard that we should remain calm, that our tools would now work and that we would get her out of that vehicle.'

Divine Intervention: Katie Lentz was saved after emergency workers from Hannibal fire services arrived with heavy duty cutting equipment

That is when officers from the 
neighboring Hannibal Fire Department arrived with their jaws-of-life and
Lentz was pulled to safety and put into an air ambulance to hospital.

Turning to thank the guardian angel who had arrived from nowhere at their lowest ebb, the emergency crews could not find him.

The highway had been blocked for a 
quarter of a mile each end during the hour and a half rescue and no 
bystanders and parked cars were anywhere near the crash site on Highway 
19 near Center.

'We would like to find this gentleman and be able to thank him,' Reed said before Dowling identified himself.

'As a first responder, you don't know what you're going to run into. We have a lot of tools, and we have intensive training. In this particular case, it is my feeling that it was nothing more than sheer faith and nothing short of a miracle.'

Lentz suffered several broken bones 
to repair her legs, but her friends and family say that her spirit has 
been boosted by the somewhat divine intervention.

Saved: Chief Raymond Reed said that the Catholic priest, now identified as Patrick Dowling, made everyone including Katie Lentz calmer before the jaw-of-life appeared from Hannibal

'Both of her legs are very damaged,' Lentz's friend Amanda Wiseman said.

'Her wrist is broken, several broken ribs, so she's had a lot of broken bones to deal with.'

Chief Raymond Reed said rescue crews were struggling to cut through the strong metal of Lentz's Mercedes.

'It was a very well-built car, and when you compact materials like that one, they become even stronger because you're cutting through multiple things instead of one layer,' Reed said.

Reed says Lentz was pinned in between
the steering wheel and the seat and the prayer was offered just as he 
was told by the paramedics that Lentz was failing.

'Where did this guy come from?' Lentz's friend Travis Wiseman asked. 

The driver of the other car in that 
accident, Aaron Smith, has been charged with a DWI, second degree 
assault and failure to drive on the right half of the roadway.
