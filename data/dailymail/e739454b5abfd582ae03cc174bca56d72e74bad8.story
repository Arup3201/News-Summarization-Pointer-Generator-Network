As photographic subjects go, John Sinclair's object of affection is hardly the most glamorous.

For more than 50 years, the retired surgeon has travelled across the Scottish Highlands taking pictures of local buses.

Clocking up an estimated 100,000 miles of bus journeys along the way, Mr Sinclair has also captured some beautiful images of the area's mountain landscapes across five decades.

Scenic: Retired doctor John Sinclair has had his collection of pictures of Highland Buses published

Nostalgia: A Highland Bus at Lower Diabaig in May 1967

Obsession: John began taking pictures of Highland buses, such as this one at the pier in Kyleakin in 1962, as a young man

Beautiful: Mr Sinclair says he started by taking pictures of the buses but also captured some stunning landscapes

Sign of the times: Mr Sinclair's book Highland Buses already seems to be selling well on Amazon which has only two copies left

John Sinclair, now 72, said he fell in love with 
the Highland Omnibuses as a schoolboy and later travelled far and wide 
to get pictures of the vehicles.

His book 
Highland Buses could even become an unlikely best-seller - today there were only two copies left for sale on Amazon.

John, from Milngavie, East Dunbartonshire, said: 'It’s all about nostalgia. It’s not just about buses, it’s about the rural scenery and the signs of the times.

'None of the pictures were taken at bus stations or stances but all over the Highlands in rural sightings.

'I just did it for fun. I love travelling around and talking to people. It’s an unusual topic for a book. The photographs are unique, nobody else was doing it at the time.'

Mr Sinclair practised medicine in Stornoway and other towns across the north of Scotland before becoming a surgeon based in Glasgow.

His obsession with buses began with his 17-mile journey to and from school every day and in 1961 he bought his first 35mm camera with colour slides.

Frozen landscape: This picture was taken in Cairngorns. Mr Sinclair bought his first 35mmm camera in 1961

Scenery: John first started visiting the Highlands to see relatives and said he did a lot of hitchhiking because he couldn't afford a car

Changes: John says he has seen the way in which the bus service operates change dramatically in his time photographing them

His family had relatives in Inverness and as he grew older, John made numerous trips to the Highlands where his unusual hobby took hold.

He said: 'I hitchhiked everywhere to get there as I didn’t have a car.

'You just stood and smiled and people stopped in those days. I occasionally travelled by bus but only short distances because I couldn’t afford it.

'I loved the scenery and the idea of narrow rural roads in the Highlands. They weren’t just straightforward A to B bus routes. Buses were part of social life back then. It was a vital form of transport.'

After moving to Edinburgh as a medical student in the 1960s, John continued to visit the Highlands at least twice every year.

His favourite spot was the nuclear reactor in Dounray, Caithness, where 40 old buses dropped off and picked up staff.

John said: 'There were no youth hostels in Thurso so I often stayed in police cells and signed out at six o’clock in the morning.

'You could do that back then because there was nowhere else to stay. There were very elderly buses in Dounray.

Line up: Double decker are parked up at a depot in Edinburgh in 1976

Passion: John moved to Edinburgh to study medicine in the 1960s but kept returning to the Highlands to take more photos

Important: For isolated communities, Highland buses were an important part of social life for many years

Unusual: John said he often stayed in police cells in Thurso because there were no youth hostels

'Staff actually complained because there were no platform doors and some buses had no heaters which was not good in the winter.

'40 buses used to sit outside the plant all day and for a young enthusiast like me it was a fantastic line up. I could wander in freely which you wouldn’t be able to do now.'

The buses which John photographed were operated by Highland Omnibuses part of the state-owned Scottish Bus Group that operated services throughout Scotland.

The company ran services throughout the Highlands, from Thurso and Wick in the far north through Fort William to Oban in the south, and west to Kyle of Lochalsh and the ferry to Skye.

Over the decades he has spent photographing buses, John has noticed a number of changes in the way they are operated.

He said: 'Back then there were bus conductors who worked with the driver as a team and it was a much more leisurely way of life.

Colourful: The rugged terrian of Birichen in January, 1977

Special service: Conductors were known to deliver prescriptions for people years ago

Audience: The book was created with book enthusiasts in mind, but John thinks readers have also been struck by the scenery

Success: After receiving positive feed back on Highland Buses, John is working on a follow-up about buses in Skye and the Western Isles

Modern methods: John says conductors now stick to a strict timetable and there is less communication with passengers

Enthusiast: Retired doctor and amateur photographer John Sinclair with his book Highland Buses

'The conductors and drivers would spend a lot of time chatting with passengers. Some buses were even known to take prescriptions to houses.

'It was part of community life. Now, the schedules are so tight and there are no conductors. Personal contact is lost.'

John is still travelling far and wide to take pictures of buses but he admits he rarely uses a bus to get there.

Following the success of his book, he is currently working on another which will feature buses in Skye and the Western Isles where he worked for a number of years.

John added: 'Highland Buses has been selling really well and people seem to be taking to that nostalgia.

'The book was put together with bus enthusiasts in mind but because of the period and the scenery it has captured a wider audience.

'I still drive all over the country, going around the Highlands and other remote locations to take pictures of buses but sadly there isn’t much variety these days.'
