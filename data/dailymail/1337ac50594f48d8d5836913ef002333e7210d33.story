Exit package: Former Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond who quit last week

Barclays was under intense pressure last night to strip Bob Diamond of his £18million golden goodbye.

Vince Cable piled pressure on Barclays to block the pay-off to its former chief executive, warning that it would ‘heap shame’ on the beleaguered bank.

Furious shareholders are also demanding that Mr Diamond, who has earned an estimated £120million from the bank since 2007, should not be given a penny more.

Mr Diamond resigned as chief executive last week over the bank’s involvement in the interest rate fixing scandal.

The Bank of England’s deputy governor, Paul Tucker, will face tough questioning from MPs today over what he knew about rate fixing at Barclays, following revelations last week that he telephoned Mr Diamond to discuss the issue at the height of the Libor scandal in 2008.

Yesterday it emerged that Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood was among the ‘senior Whitehall figures’ who called Mr Tucker at that time to express concern about Libor – the interest rate at which banks lend to each other.

A Whitehall source insisted he had done nothing to put pressure on Barclays to lower its Libor rate artificially.

Business Secretary Mr Cable said ministers were powerless to stop the pay-off to Mr Diamond, but suggested he would be ‘very surprised’ if it were approved by the Barclays board as it struggles to rebuild the bank’s battered image.

‘There isn’t anything government can directly do about it, but I think in view of the shame that’s already been heaped on Barclays bank, I would be very, very surprised if the chairman and the board were to allow another outrage to occur,’ he said on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show yesterday.

‘I think in view of what’s happened, I sincerely hope that the board of Barclays take a fairly strict view about all of this.’

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, who made 
Mr Cable look uncomfortable on the show, also called for action to block
the ‘golden parachute’ payment to Mr Diamond, branding it ‘outrageous’.

The National Association of Pension 
Funds – one of the most powerful shareholder groups in the country – led
calls for Barclays to claw back bonuses from Mr Diamond and other 
directors.

Chief executive Joanne Segars said: 
‘Shareholders, including pension funds, have been negatively affected by
their investments in Barclays.

‘The message to Barclays from shareholders is that failure must not be rewarded.

Shares have slumped by almost 40 per 
cent during Mr Diamond’s short but scandal-ridden reign. In the 18 
months he has served as chief executive more than £12billion has been 
wiped off the bank’s value.

Mr Diamond had been ‘promised’ £18million by Barclays in the form of share options and long-term incentive plans.

But Alison Carnwath, chairman of the 
bank’s pay committee, is said to be fighting ‘tooth and nail’ to prevent
Mr Diamond receiving the payments.

But even if the bank wins that 
particular battle, he still owns around 13.2million shares in the bank. 
He will also be automatically entitled to one year’s basic salary of 
£1.35million.

Mr Diamond repeatedly refused to give
up the payouts of his own volition during his three-hour appearance 
before the Commons Treasury select committee last week, saying it is a 
matter for the board.

Last night one of the leading members of the inquiry admitted the committee had failed to hold Mr Diamond to account.

Tory MP Andrea Leadsom said: ‘I don’t
think we felt we did a fantastic job either. It’s a fair criticism to 
say “You guys were useless”.’

Mrs Leadsom, a former banker, said members had only seven minutes each to question Mr Diamond, armed with little more than what had appeared in the press. She added: ‘In a sense, we were batting in the dark.’
