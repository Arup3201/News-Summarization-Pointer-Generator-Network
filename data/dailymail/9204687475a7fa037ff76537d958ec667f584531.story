Prosecutors said Robbie Gemmell, 17, confessed to his father that he was driving the car when it crashed into a wall, killing his three friends

A teenager whose careless driving caused the deaths of three school friends claimed it was one of the victims who was behind the wheel, a court has heard.

Robbie Gemmell,17, originally told police officers that he was a front seat passenger in a Peugeot 205 that crashed on a single track road in near Tyninghame, East Lothian, in November 2013.

The accident claimed the lives of Dunbar Grammar School pupils Jenna Barbour,18, David Armstrong,15, and 16-year-old Joshua Stewart.

Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard on Tuesday how the quartet were travelling in a Peugeot 206 when it struck a large wall support on a stretch of road known as Limetree near Dunbar.

The court heard how accident investigators estimated the Peugeot was travelling at a minimum of 50 to 54 miles per hour in the moments before the collision.

David Armstrong had been thrown from the car upon impact and that emergency service workers found his lifeless body 15 metres from the vehicle.

Gemmell originally told officers that Jenna - who was due to go travelling in New Zealand in January 2014 - had been driving at the time of the fatal collision, it was said.

Prosecution lawyer Graeme Jessop said that Gemmell - who was in hospital recovering from his injuries at the time of his confession - tearfully confessed to his father that he had been the driver.

Mr Jessop added: 'The accused became upset and started to cry. His father, Mark Gemmell, asked him if he had something to say and he said "Dad I was driving the car".

'The accused and his parents were all in tears and and his father told him to tell them everything.

'He proceeded to do so. Robbie Gemmell told his father that he drove down the road, he didn't specify how far or for how long but that he thought that he was doing around 45mph.

'He remembers being on the road but Jenna having to grab the wheel to straighten them up.

'Robbie remembers pulling the steering wheel back the opposite direction from Jenna and then they suddenly struck a wall.'

18-year-old Jenna Barbour and David Armstrong, 15, both died of their injuries after the accident in East Lothian

He added: 'When he had finished his account, his father said that he would speak to the police about it and that Robbie Gemmell would have to tell them everything he had just told them.'

The  story emerged after Gemmell, of  Dunbar, pleaded guilty before Sheriff Gordon Liddle to driving causing the deaths of David Armstrong, Jenna Barbour and Joshua Stewart on November 25 2013 by driving a car without due care and attention at Limetree Walk, near Tyninghame, East Lothian,.

After hearing the circumstances of the case, Sheriff Liddle extended his sympathy to everybody who has been involved in the incident.

Deferring sentence in order for the court to obtain reports, Sheriff Liddle added: 'I do not want to deal with this case but it is my duty.'

Joshua Stewart, 16, died of severe head wounds

Gemmell - who has no previous convictions - wept uncontrollably as Mr Jessop read the circumstances surrounding the case in open court.

Members of Gemmell's family and relatives of the deceased also wept as they heard about the causes of the offence from the public benches.

Mr Jessop told the court that the car involved in the collision belonged to Jenna Barbour. At some point in the evening, Gemmell took over driving from Miss Barbour.

The court heard that at 8.15pm, Gemmell made a 999 call to ambulance control.

Mr Jessop said: 'Due to the caller being in a distressed and disorientated state, it took between 15 and 20 minutes to establish the caller's exact location. This caused difficulties and delay in the emergency services tracing the whereabouts of the collision.

'A transcript of the emergency call highlights the distressed state of the accused as he did everything he was asked to do by the emergency call handler in a futile attempt to provide assistance to the injured passengers.'

The court heard that the police arrived at the collision scene at 8.55pm.

Mr Jessop added: 'About 20.55 hours on the same date, police officers and paramedics arrived at Limetree Walk, Tyninghame, where they observed the accused waving at them.

'They immediately rendered assistance to the accused and checked on the conditions of the passengers.

'It was apparent that the three passengers had all succumbed to their injuries.

'There was only one vehicle involved, a Peugeot 206 registered number Y947 CSH which had struck a large wall support and spun coming to rest approximately 25 metres from the impact point.

'The deceased David Armstrong had been thrown from the vehicle on impact and was lying on a verge approximately 15 metres from the vehicle with severe head trauma.

'Lying parallel to the driver's side of the vehicle was the now deceased Jenna Barbour and the third deceased Joshua Stewart was lying parallel to the rear of the vehicle on the road way, again with severe head trauma.

'They had been removed by the accused under direction of the emergency call handler.

'The impact had caused the engine to detach from the Peugeot and was lying on the nearside verge. 

'Various other engine and car parts were scattered over the road surface in an adjoining field.

'At that time Gemmell stated to a police officer and paramedics that he was the front seat passenger of the vehicle and had not been wearing a seat belt at the time of the collision.

'Gemmell was thereafter transferred to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary for treatment. Arrangements were thereafter made to have the families of all three deceased informed of the deaths of their children.

Collision: The road to Tyninghame Beach where the car hit the wall. After the impact the car span around and came to rest approximately 25 metres away

'About 2350 hours, same date police officers attended at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary where they spoke briefly with Gemmell.

'He again stated that he was the front seat passenger at the time of the collision and that David Armstrong and Joshua Stewart were within the rear of the vehicle. He claimed that the girl - Jenna Barbour - was driving at the time of the collision.'

'At round 0100 hours on Tuesday November 26 2013, the undertakers arrived at the locus and it was decided that Jenna Barbour's body would be removed first.

'At this time, it was observed that Jenna Barbour had injuries to the left side of her body and head which would be consistent to her possibly sitting in the passenger seat of the vehicle and not the driver's seat as stated by Gemmell.

'At this time a more detailed search was carried out of the Peugeot motor car which revealed Jenna Barbour's boots jammed within the front passenger foot well of the car while one of the accused's shoes was found jammed in the driver's foot well.'

The court heard that in the days following the incident, Gemmell told family and friends that he had been driving the vehicle at the time of the collision.

Police arrested him on November 29. He later appeared in court charged with driving offences.

Defence solicitor advocate John Scott QC described the incident as an 'unspeakable tragedy.'

However, he said he would reserve his mitigation for his client's sentencing hearing.

Gemmell will be sentenced on September 19  at 2pm at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
