First Lady Michelle Obama spent the final hours of her visit to Japan 'banging the drum' on her mission to promote education among girls world-wide. 

Mrs Obama stopped off at 1,000-year-old Buddhist and Shinto houses of worship in Kyoto - which in the past served as Japan's capital.

Mrs Obama toured the Kiyomizu-dera temple, a UNESCO World Heritage site built in 780 on a tree-lined hill overlooking the city, and also visited the Fushimi Inari shrine, one of the most well-known Shinto shrines.

At the Buddhist temple, the first lady watched local college students enacting a Noh performance, a classical style of Japanese musical drama using ornate costumes and masks to play the roles of women, ghosts and various other characters.

Mrs Obama did not accompany her husband on a trip to Japan last year so used this visit to promote girls' education projects

Local college students in kimono performed a brief piece of Noh, a classical Japanese musical drama that usually employs elaborate costumes and stylized masks to symbolize roles of women, ghosts and other characters.

After Kiyomizu-dera, a UNESCO World Heritage site, Mrs Obama traveled across town to the 1,300-year-old Fushimi Inari shrine, a place of worship for Japan's other major religion, Shinto. 

There are 30,000 such shrines in Japan that venerate the guardian god of abundant harvests, prosperity and family safety. The Fushimi Inari is renowned for the many crimson torii gates lining paths through its leafy grounds.

Commenting on the performance, Mrs Obama said: 'You guys are good! That's good exercise. Wonderful.'

Mrs Obama arrived in Japan on Wednesday for a visit that has focused mainly on cooperation in the 'Let Girls Learn' initiative to support girls' education in the developing world. President Barack Obama and his wife recently announced the program, which will devote millions of dollars in aid for girls' empowerment projects.

Writing on her blog, Mrs Obama said: 'Does this kind of work sound exciting to you? If so, you should consider joining the Peace Corps

'You can also make a difference by tutoring a classmate, or reading to a younger sibling, or volunteering through your school or place of worship.' 

Mrs Obama is flying to Cambodia today on the final leg of her Far East tour. The impoverished nation is one of the 11 countries to be included in the Peace Corps' 'Let Girls Learn' programme.

This is Mrs Obama's first visit to Japan, as she did not accompany the president on his state visit last year. The visit is seen partly as a way of making up for her absence then, and as a sign of closeness between the allies.

Michelle Obama has got the rhythm of fashion in her soul! During her Japanese tour she's had style hit after style hit. And today was no different!

Wearing the swoon worthy Dries Van Noten "Gothic" Jacquard open-front Riah coat, she looked incredible. The jacket is expensive at $1795, but think of all the statement coats you don't have to buy.

This coat is a walker length that has contrasting prints on the shoulders, bodice, and bottom. It looks as though Michelle had her sleeves altered to have a 3/4" length, but the change doesn't take away from the design.

We think it's a great piece worth investing in but if it's a little out of your price range (ours too) then why not shop the look for less with our edit below? Wear yours over an all-black palette for a fashion-forward finish.
