Italy's new prime minister has come under fire for appointing female ministers for their beauty rather than their brains - an identical row to that which engulfed his playboy predecessor Silvio Berlusconi.

Matteo Renzi, who came to power in February, has gone to lengths to distance himself from Berlusconi, who made no secret of his penchant for attractive young women, selecting a former glamour model to join his cabinet and cavorting with showgirls and models at his famous Bunga Bunga parties.

But yesterday the Democratic Party leader was attacked by one of his most senior female politicians for doing the same thing for which 'Il Cavaliere' was ridiculed throughout his premiership.

Pored over: Marianna Madia, the 34-year-old minister for public administration, is also regularly pored over by the Italian press

Rosy Bindi, a stalwart of the centre-left party and now president of a parliamentary anti-mafia commission, said: 'I believe some of the ministers were chosen because they are young and also good-looking.'

After taking the reigns of government after an internal party coup seven months ago, 39-year-old Renzi - who is nicknamed Demolition Man for his no-nonsense approach to political reform - formed a new cabinet notable for its youth high proportion of female politicians.

Among them is Maria Elena Boschi who has been the focus of much tabloid attention since becoming Minister for Reform, for her youth and photogenic looks as well as her figure-hugging business suits.

But the 33-year-old hit back at Ms Bindi's claim yesterday, saying: 'I believe that we will be judged on how good we are, not how good-looking we are. We need to respond to the needs of ordinary people and that is what we are doing every day.'

She has surprised the stuffier corners of Italian politics in pushing through a complicated series of reforms to the country's Senate.

She is not the only female politician to have attracted attention for reasons other than her work.

Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini, 41, and Marianna Madia, the 34-year-old minister for public administration, are also both regularly pored over by the Italian press.  

But today, a number of other female politicians leapt to their defence, with one branding Ms Bindi's comments 'an old-fashioned way of looking at things.' 

Silvio Berlusconi raised eyebrows in 2008 when he appointed Mara Carfagna (right) as government spokesperson a year after saying of her: 'If I was not already married I would have married her immediately'

'Beauty has nothing to do with it,' deputy party secretary Debora Serracchiani told La Repubblica on Sunday. 'The ministers were chosen because they are competent and capable.'

MEP Alessandra Moretti, another Democratic politician  whose looks have attracted attention, added: 'They've demonstrated that aside from their physical appearances, they are competent. In politics some people are afraid of a strong woman who is also good-looking.'

Ms Bindi herself was once mocked by Berlusconi on national television when he called her 'prettier than she is intelligent' - a slight intended to imply that she is neither. 

Silvio Berlusconi became infamous in Italy  for his sexist gags, dalliances with teenage underwear models and debauched 'Bunga Bunga' that provided the world media's headline writers with a near unending flow of material throughout his premiership.

In 2008, he raised eyebrows across Italian media and political circles when he appointed former glamour model Mara Carfagna as government spokesperson, a year after saying of her: 'If I was not already married I would have married her immediately.'

He later made a grovelling public apology to his wife for 'wounding her dignity'.

Mr Renzi's supporters have been at pains to make clear his attitudes towards women are in no way related to those of Mr Berlusconi.
