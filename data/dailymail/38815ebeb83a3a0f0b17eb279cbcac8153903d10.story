The last wish of dying man has been fulfilled after he was threatened with being kept from his wife of almost 50 years in his final days.

Matt Monschein, 71, was told by doctors last month that nothing else could be done for him in the final stages of pancreatic cancer.

He was then given the shattering news that he might be restricted in the time he spend with his wife of 46 years, Pat - as she was currently in hospital after having both legs amputated due to complications from diabetes.

Holding on: Matt and Pat Monschein were allowed to spend their last days together at a Cleveland Hospital after Mr Monschein was told he was in the end stages of pancreatic cancer

Together through life: The Monscheins have been married for 46 years and have hardly spent any time apart before they both fell ill

The couple, from Lorain, were left devastated by the news that they might not be able to spend their last moments together at Grace Fairview Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio  - because it did not offer the hospice care that Mr Monschein needed.

Neither could Mrs Monschein be looked after at a hospice because she needs round-the-clock care including dialysis.

One of the couple's two sons Mike Monschein told Fox 8: 'He’s going to get a drive-by, see mom two hours, and that’s how you end a 46-year marriage.'

He had appealed to local politicians, authorities and media outlets in the hope of bringing his parents back together.

The way we were: The couple married after meeting when Matt was serving in the Navy in Newfoundland, Canada

The couple had barely spent any time 
apart in almost five decades, since they met while Mr Monschein served 
in the Navy in Canada.

After being helped by a local 
TV station to navigate the bureaucracy, the elderly couple have been allowed to spend what precious time 
they have left lying in beds side by side at the hospital.

Both remained in the same room but Mr Monschein's condition worsened on Friday. According to cleveland.com, the hospital chaplain renewed their wedding vows.

Last days: The elderly couple have been allowed to share a room at the Grace Fairview Hospita in Ohio with their beds side by side
