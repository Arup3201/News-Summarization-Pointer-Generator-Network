Theodore Welp, former CEO of Tucson Electric Power Co (pictured in 1982). He was killed along with his wife and son in what has been described as a 'heinous' crime in rural Idaho

A former Arizona power company executive, his wife and their adult son were identified on Thursday as the victims of a triple homicide in the foothills outside Boise.

The Ada County Coroner's office did not release the causes of death of Theodore M. Welp, 80, Delores E. Welp, 77, and their son, 52-year-old Thomas P. Welp.

They were found dead on Tuesday. No motive has been released. 

Idaho authorities said they were working around the clock to find those responsible for a 'heinous' triple murder at a rural home in the Boise foothills. One man has been arrested on theft counts.  

'When I say this crime is heinous, that is probably an understatement,' Ada County Sheriff Gary Raney said on Wednesday. 

'Somebody who violently, without cause, without any provocation that I know of, killed three innocent people. We are working 24 hours a day with everything we've got to put that person in jail.'

The Welps formerly lived in Arizona, where Theodore Welp was the chief of Tuscon Electric Power Co. (TEP) in the 1980s.  

Welp was in charge of building a facility in the late 1970s and spun-off a TEP subsidiary which made him and few execs millions of dollar, Tucsonnews.com reported. 

He was blamed by some for the financial downfall of the company. 

The Arizona attorney general's office launched an investigation into the financial dealings but the probe resulted in no criminal charges. Investigators said no clear conspiracy or fraudulent acts could be proven.

Theodore and Elaine Welp were also involved with charitable organizations, including an organization that funds research on vision impairment and blindness.

A 22-year-old Nampa man arrested on Wednesday is accused of grand theft and forgery but not murder, the sheriff's office said in a statement.

Adam M. Dees was arrested at a Boise electronics store, The Idaho Statesman reported. 

Sheriff Raney said detectives were searching Dees' home in hopes of finding more evidence.

Authorities said Dees had tried to sell a wedding ring in recent days, but they don't know if it's connected to the killings. They asked the public to provide information if possible.

He is accused of three felony counts each of grand theft and forgery and a misdemeanor count of carrying a concealed weapon without a permit. 

Dees was scheduled to appear in Ada County Court later on Thursday. 

Deputies also seized a 2003 black Subaru Legacy with a gold panel that Dees was driving.

Raney declined to speculate on a motive or say if anything was missing from the home. 

He said the victims were related, and the killings occurred sometime between Sunday evening and Tuesday morning.

He said police wanted to hear from anyone who saw the Subaru near the murder scene between Sunday and Tuesday night.

'I want the community to help us put the right person in jail,' the sheriff said.

'It's hard for me to fathom even after 31 years of law enforcement what could possibly motivate somebody to do to these people what they did.' 

The killings took place in what records say is a three-bedroom, three-bathroom home on about 20 acres with a total value of about $800,000. 

Authorities said the property has horses and other buildings.

He said police responded after a family member called on Tuesday.

'I've probably not seen a bloodier or more violent murder occur,' Raney said.

He said other law enforcement agencies were investigating, including the U.S. Marshals Service
