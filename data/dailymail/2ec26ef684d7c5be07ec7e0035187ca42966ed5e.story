A moped rider who left an eight-year-old boy critically injured in a hit and run crash has been spared prison.

Joe Helliwell, 20, who did not have a licence and was uninsured to ride the moped, crashed into Lucas Thorpe as he crossed the street, leaving him critically injured. 

The youngster suffered a fractured skull, eye socket and leg in the collision and had to be placed in an induced coma at Sheffield Children’s Hospital following the crash in April.

Seriously injured: A moped rider who left an eight-year-old boy critically injured in a hit and run crash has been spared prison. Lucas Thorpe suffered a fractured skull, eye socket and leg in the collision

The schoolboy had to be placed in an induced coma at Sheffield Children’s Hospital following the crash in April

He was struck moments after leaving his grandparents’ house - on the very first day he had ever been allowed to walk to his friend’s house to play - and was dragged along the road by the bike, leaving his family fearing his face would be scarred for life.

Helliwell, from Rotherham, South Yorks., fled the scene before police arrived and only handed himself in four days later, when he walked into a police station with a solicitor.

He admitted both motoring offences and failing to report an accident when he appeared at Rotherham Magistrates’ Court.

He was handed a six-week curfew order, which will see him wearing an electronic tag which alerts the authorities if he leaves his house between 7pm and 6am.

Surgery: The youngster with his mother Samantha Scott. He underwent emergency surgery at Sheffield Children's Hospital to release pressure on his brain and to stop a bleed after the crash

He has also been banned from driving for a year and was ordered to pay £85 costs.

However, his victim’s mum, Samantha Scott, 32, said she was ‘disgusted’ at the leniency of the sentence and said she wanted Helliwell to apologise for his actions.

'We are disgusted by the leniency of his sentence but what we are most upset about is that Helliwell has never once said sorry,' she said.

'I didn’t think we would be bringing Lucas home.

Angry: Lucas Scott with his mum Samantha. He was left fighting for his life following the collision

'All I am really bothered about is that we still have Lucas.

'When I got to him after it happened the bike was in bits, there were pieces of it everywhere, and Lucas was surrounded by paramedics and people helping at the scene.

'He was unconscious at first and had blood coming from his mouth and ears, but then he came round and was screaming ‘mum’.

'He was covered in blood and when we got to the hospital they told us he was critical.'

The youngster, whose leg is still in a plastercast, underwent emergency surgery at Sheffield Children’s Hospital to release pressure on his brain and to stop a bleed after the crash.

Ms Scott, a mother-of-four from Rotherham said: 'All we want is an apology - an acknowledgment of what he did and some sign that he is sorry for it, because at the moment all we know is that he is walking around our village as though he has done nothing wrong.

'Lucas could easily walk past him in the street.'

However, she said she was delighted with the progress Lucas has made.

The youngster, who was a goalkeeper with the Young Owls under-eights football team at the time of the collision, is back at school and able to hobble around, despite his leg remaining in the cast.

She said: 'We didn’t think we would be bringing Lucas home at one point, so to look at him now is amazing.

'He is still scared when he hears the sound of bikes, so the scars will take a long time to heal - both physically and psychologically - but we are very proud of him for the way he has fought back.'

Ms Scott said she hopes Lucas will be playing football with his team over the summer.

'He is a goalkeeper so is used to getting kicked, but after surviving this he will be able to put up with anything that happens when he is in the net now!' she said.

Sheffield Wednesday winger Jermaine Johnson said: 'On behalf of all the lads here at SWFC I would like to wish little Lucas a very speedy recovery.

'In recognition of the bravery he has shown we would like to invite Lucas, and his family, to attend a game as VIP guests when he is feeling better.'
