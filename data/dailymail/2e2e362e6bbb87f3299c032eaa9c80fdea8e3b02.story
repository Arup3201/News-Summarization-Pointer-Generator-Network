With a huge platform heel and racy zip detail, these leather shoes might be considered daring for a lot of women.

But they were no problem for Daphne Guinness, 46, fashion muse and heiress to the Guinness family fortune, who sported the unusual shoes on the streets of New York yesterday.

Despite the cold winter weather, Daphne wore the very high shoes with tiny black shorts, tights and a black leather and fur coat, with her blonde and black-dyed hair piled into a messy bun.

Looking relaxed and comfortable, Daphne seemed completely unfazed by the height of the heels, as she tottered into her New York hotel.

Quite how she managed to stand up in 
them – let alone walk – is anyone’s guess, but if anyone can pull off the art of walking in high heels, it's Daphne.

The artist and fashion lover, who was best 
friends with the late designer Alexander McQueen and fashion icon 
Isabella Blow, is known for her love of platforms.

In an interview last year she stated that her treasured 
Massaro heels were her ‘fail-safe piece. I can’t wear anything else,’ 
she told Net-a-porter.

The huge shoes wouldn't look out of place on Lady Gaga, who credits Daphne Guinness as an 'inspiration.'

The footwear wouldn’t look out of place on Lady Gaga, also renowned for her love of elaborate shoes and who has previously praised Daphne as an inspiration to her.

‘Isabella [Blow] and Daphne are two exceptional human beings,’ the singer has said.

‘They have helped me look inside myself. It is as if we are all cut from the same cloth.’

Daphne has appeared on the cover of Vogue Italia, produced and starred in 
various short-films and, in 2011, teamed up with cosmetic giants MAC to 
design and model a range of makeup.

She has three children with ex-husband, Spyros Niarchos, the second son of Stavros Niarchos, the shipping magnate.
