One woman has claimed that the military cut her family's pay after her husband cheated on her.

Sara Rutledge (a pseudonym) tells HuffPost Live that she discovered just one day after her wedding that her husband was sleeping with the wife of his 'battle buddy.'

But the risk of losing the financial benefits offered to military families - such as health insurance, housing allowances and tax breaks - left her ambivalent about whether to tell anyone.

Sara Rutledge, a former military wife, says her family's pay was cut after her husband cheated on her

'When I found out, I had this moral conundrum of: Should I even tell the husband?' she said.

'These are soldiers who have been deployed together multiple times. ... So not only am I risking messing up the 
dynamics of this unit that needs to function as one, like an army of one
 when they're deployed and working together, but I'm also risking the 
financial security of my house because our paycheck was significantly 
cut,' Ms Rutledge added, noting that fraternizing with other men's wives
 is a punishable offense.

Ms Rutledge - who has since divorced - informed her husband's colleague of the infidelity via the internet while on her honeymoon, and he subsequently told their superior officers. When her husband returned from the trip, he admitted to the affair.

'When he did find out, when I did tell everyone, we did lose a significant part of our paycheck,' she said.

But she says she couldn't keep the infidelity a secret from the man whose wife her husband cheated with.

'I felt like this man who had served our country has a right to know what his wife was doing with the person he considered a close friend,' she said.

Ms Rutledge, who was a week shy of her 22nd birthday when she tied the knot, also said that many people in the military get married because of the financial benefits offered.

'It just makes sense. If they were thinking of getting married, they're just like, "Why don't we go ahead and do it?" because you can almost double your paycheck. ... So if you're gonna make more and you're already kind of in love, why not get married? I know it sounds terrible, but it's true.'

As for the other couple, 'This man and his wife did not receive any punishment,' Ms Rutledge said.

'They are still married, actually.'
