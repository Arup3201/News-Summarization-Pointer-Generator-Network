Romanian bank robber Constantin Alexandroaia was jailed for 13-and-a-half years for blowing up three cash machines in the Midlands, escaping with £27,000

A Romanian bank robber who forced explosive gas into cash machines to blow them up and steal thousands of pounds has been jailed.

Constantin Alexandroaia stole £27,000 in three raids on cash machines in the Midlands, claiming he had no choice but to turn to crime after going broke and having to sell his family dog.

The father-of-one, who rigged up explosions by attaching pipes to Barclays ATMs and forcing gas from cylinders into them, admitted the 'well planned and well executed' attacks.

Alexandroaia, a scrap dealer from Sparkhill, Birmingham, caused £73,000 damage to cash machines across the Midlands during the raids which took place during a 25-day period this year.

The married 33-year-old pleaded guilty to three counts of causing explosions and three counts of burglary on the first day of his trial at Birmingham Crown Court.

During sentencing, Alexandroaia told the court he decided to blow up two cashpoints in Birmingham and another in Leicester because he was broke and had been forced to sell his dog.

The court was told that the 'well planned and well executed' ATM attacks in March and April were the first of their type in the UK.

Alexandroaia and an unknown accomplice were thwarted in the Birmingham attacks, in Druids Heath and Castle Bromwich, after security glass stopped them from reaching the money which had been blown out the back of the machines.

The judge said it was pure luck that none of the people living in the flat above the Alcester Road South Barclays in Druids Heath were injured by the explosion on March 21.

The masked pair unsuccessfully struck again days later at the Chester Road branch in Castle Bromwich, on April 1.

But they did escape with £27,000 from the Sibson Road branch in Birstall, Leicester, on April 15, cash which has never been recovered. All three attacks took place at around 4am.

The court was shown CCTV of Alexandroaia rigging up the cylinders and smashing into the buildings. The roof could also be seen falling in during the Druids Heath raid and a chair was thrown across the branch in Leicester.

Alexandroaia was arrested as he tried to board a plane to his native Romania at Luton Airport on April 24.

He was caught after his blood was found in an abandoned and previously stolen BMW getaway car after the Castle Bromwich raid.

The court heard that he had served time in jail for theft and dishonesty in Romania and Italy.

He was also handed a conditional discharge in August 2013 for attacking a hospital car park cash machine with a sledgehammer.

Justin Hugheston-Roberts, defending, said: 'The defence accepts entirely his involvement.

'He was to be evicted and had to sell the family dog.

'He could not cope here in this country, which is why he undertook the request from others to become involved in organised crime.'

In a letter, read out on his behalf, he said: 'I agreed to participate because I needed the money for my family. I am sorry and very ashamed for what I did.'

Recorder Melbourne Inman QC, said: 'These offences were very serious, well planned and very dangerous.'
