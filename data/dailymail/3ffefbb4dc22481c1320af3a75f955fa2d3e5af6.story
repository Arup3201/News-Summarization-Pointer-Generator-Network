Pep Guardiola is fighting an internal battle at Bayern Munich, alerting the Barclays Premier League's elite to his services.

The Spaniard arrived in Germany at the start of the season and has already won the Bundesliga, UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA World Club Cup.

But the former Barcelona manager is facing battle to convince his highly-talented squad that he remains the man to continue the club's recent success.

Under pressure: Pep Guardiola is in danger of losing the dressing room at Bayern Munich

Despite having already won three trophies this season, the club's humiliating Champions League semi-final failure against Real Madrid has raised questions over his reign.

There is an emerging perception that the team has gone backwards under Guardiola, a notion amplified by their dismal showing against Carlo Ancelotti's side.

And there is a growing contingent of players in the Bayern squad who share that view, fuelling concerns Guardiola is losing the dressing room.

There is also a feeling the strong team-spirit that has been nurtured during Louis van Gaal and Jupp Heynckes' reign is softening under Guardiola.

Bayern legend Franz Beckenbauer alluded to the problems following the demoralising defeat to Real last week.

'Bayern are not right. This is something that we have known for weeks. The disappointment is huge,' said Beckenbauer.

'I can't change what I feel and what I feel is we must play with the ball and attack as much as possible.

'Real have a magnificent team at the moment and our limitations have been exposed to a certain extent.'

Whether the internal problems at the Allianz Arena will result in Guardiola lasting just one season in Germany remains to be seen.

But there will be a number of English clubs monitoring Guardiola's situation ahead of the summer managerial merry-go-round in case there is a shock change.
