A Detroit-area couple who first met at a support group for weight loss surgery patients have married after losing an amazing combined total of 380 pounds.

Crysta Danaher, 34, and Bill Anderson, 44, were married on Saturday at Henry Ford Wyandotte Hospital, Michigan, where they both had bariatric surgery and later met.

Anderson has gone from 459 pounds to about 250 pounds since his May 2008 operation and his new wife Danaher has lost about 180 pounds since her 2009 procedure.

The surgery and support group have ‘changed everything,' said Anderson, who has since run two full marathons and more than a dozen half-marathons.

‘There isn't any aspect of my life it hasn't changed,’ he told The Detroit Free Press. ‘From being able to run to finding love, it's changed everything.’

The couple decided to get married on November 1 as is an important date in their relationship - they had their first date on November 1, 2011 and exactly two years later Anderson proposed to Danaher in Central Park, while in the city to run the New York City Marathon.

When it came to choosing a venue, the couple couldn't think of anywhere more fitting than Multi Purpose Room A at Henry Ford Wyandotte Hospital.

That is where they had first met in the support group where bariatric surgery patients could talk openly with others about their struggles to lose weight. 

The hospital has hosted weddings before in its chapel, but never in one of its meeting rooms. 

Although the hospital is in the middle of renovations, construction crews managed to finish the room in time for Bill and Crysta's big day.

The ceremony was officiated by the couple's yoga teacher and about 100 friends and relatives managed to squeeze in on Saturday.

A reception was held afterwards at the Italian American Hall in nearby Wyandotte.

While their guests sat down to enjoy a traditional wedding fare, the happy couple had to be more careful about what they ate as the surgery shrinks has shrunk the size of their stomachs.

The couple plan on honeymooning in Cancun, where Danaher admits they may indulge a little. 

'We're probably both going to be hurting on the honeymoon because we'll try things we shouldn't,' she said.
