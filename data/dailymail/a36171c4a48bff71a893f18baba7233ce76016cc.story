U.S. Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney is due to visit Britain this week

Senior Tory, Liberal Democrat and Labour MPs are urging U.S Presidential contender Mitt Romney to support changes to the hugely controversial UK/U.S Extradition Act during his visit to Britain.

In an open letter to Mr Romney, they urge him to back calls for UK and US citizens to be afforded the same legal protection.

Currently, Americans enjoy legal rights which are not available to Britons such as Gary McKinnon, who the U.S is seeking to extradite for hacking into military computers while searching for evidence of little green men.

The letter, signed by Tory backbencher Dominic Raab, ex-Lib Dem leader sir Ming Campbell and the Labour chairman of the home affairs select committee, Keith Vaz, says changing the extradition rules would help to strengthen relations between the two countries.

It says: ‘One issue which is controversial is the question of our extradition relations, which have generated widespread public and Parliamentary concern.

‘In December, the House of Commons unanimously voted for reform of UK extradition laws, including the arrangements under the US-UK treaty.  As a result, in March at the White House, President Obama agreed to Prime Minister David Cameron's request for a review of those arrangements.

‘If you are President, would you be willing to do the same?

‘All we ask is that the same evidential procedure is applied in UK courts as US courts for deciding whether our citizens should be extradited, and that a forum test is introduced so that, in cross-border cases, our respective courts can decide where the case should be tried bearing in mind all the relevant interests of justice.

‘Would you be willing to look sympathetically at such changes? They would be enormously appreciated by those in my country who want to see the special relationship go from strength to strength.’

Last month it emerged how seven times
more British citizens have been sent to the US under the lopsided Act 
than there have been Americans sent in the opposite direction.

Home Office figures revealed how the 
hugely controversial treaty is being used by the US authorities far more
often than their British counterparts.

Since 2004, 99 people have been extradited from the UK  to the US. 

Yet only 44 people have been extradited from the US to the UK – fewer than half as many.

When the figures are broken down by nationality, the picture is even more stark.

Some 35 British nationals have been 
extradited from the UK to the US. But as few as 5 US citizens have been 
extradited from the US to the UK.

Britain has extradited more of its 
nationals to the United States in the last six months – seven - than the
United States has sent its nationals to the UK in the last five years, 
according to data unearthed by Mr Raab.

The figures will heighten demands for
changes to the Act, which was passed by Labour in 2003, and is 
currently under review by the Home Secretary.

Critics say it is biased against UK 
nationals. Britain must provide the US authorities with ‘such 
information as would provide a reasonable basis to believe that the 
person sought committed the offence for which extradition is requested.

This is known as the ‘probable cause’
test – and means that U.S citizens have the right to a court hearing to
examine the evidence against them.

However, if the US want to extradite a
UK citizen, they need only to outline the alleged offence, the 
punishment specified by statute and provide an accurate description of 
the suspect sought.

The most high-profile victim of the 
Act is Mr McKinnon, 46, who faces being hauled to the US for crimes 
committed from the bedroom of his north London home.

He hacked into NASA and Pentagon 
computers while looking for evidence of the existence of ‘little green 
men’ Medical experts say he is likely to take his own life if 
extradited.
