Andy Murray says he would play tennis for an independent Scotland if the country votes Yes.

The former Wimbledon champion said he still firmly believed people in Scotland will vote No next month, but has always remained silent on how it would affect him.

Murray – who won Olympic Gold at London 2012 for Great Britain – is ready to represent Scotland at the Rio Olympics in 2016.

The British No 1 made it through to the third round of the US Open with a comfortable straight sets win over German qualifier Matthias Bachinger in the early hours of Friday morning.

He said: ‘If it happened where, if Scotland became independent, then I imagine I would be playing for Scotland.

‘I haven't thought that much about that yet because I don't think it's looking too likely that it's going to happen. But if it did happen, then it would be pretty much the first time in my life that I would have ever represented Scotland. 

‘Ever since I started travelling to tournaments since I was 11 years old I played under Great Britain, always travelled to team events or overseas, and we were always Great Britain. That's normal to me.

‘I've followed it very closely. I watched like 45 minutes of the second debate. But I didn't see the first one. I'm not going into that. I don't want to talk about politics in here. I'll worry about my tennis.’

If Scotland votes Yes, his first major appearance could happen at the Olympics in Rio 2016.

He watched the second TV debate between Alex Salmond and Alastair Darling on Monday, during his competition at the US Open Championships.

Along with his singles Gold medal at London 2012, Murray also teamed up with Laura Robson to win the mixed doubles Silver title.

The Scot has also been an integral part of Great Britain's revival in the Davis Cup, winning 19 of his 21 singles matches since making his debut in 2005.
