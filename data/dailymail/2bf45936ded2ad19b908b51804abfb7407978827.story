A pilot has miraculously survived after a small plane he was flying crashed into the back garden of a California home shortly after take-off.

He was seriously injured and suffered a broken leg as his Cessna 172 crashed one block from the end of a Santa Monica Airport runway.

The plane was bent in half and its wings ripped off by the crash, but officials said a cinder block wall helped absorbed much of the energy.

Broken leg: A pilot has miraculously survived but was seriously injured as his Cessna 172 crashed one block from the end of Santa Monica Airport's runway

The plane clipped several trees and a garage before it dived nose first into the ground, reported KABC in Los Angeles.

One painter working on the home was hit by flying debris and another painter was treated after inhaling aircraft fuel.

‘We were right in front of it,’ painter Luis Espana said. ‘We saw the plane wobbling - it hit a tree then it just went right in the house.’

‘We had to help the guy get out of the plane,’ he told NBC Los Angeles. ‘It was just unbelievable. We couldn't believe what was happening.’
