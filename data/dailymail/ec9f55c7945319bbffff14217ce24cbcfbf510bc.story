West Ham striker Andy Carroll has revealed he is desperate to make up for lost time over the busy Christmas period.

The 25-year-old missed the first three months of the Premier League season through injury but is finally feeling fit again and said he was 'raring to go'. 

Speaking to West Ham's official website, Carroll said: 'It's like my pre-season now, just coming back. It's my first few games, so I'm raring to go. I'm still feeling good and feeling fresh.

'It feels great for me. It's very important for me to come back from injury and stay injury free. All the work I'm doing with the medical staff and the treatment team is keeping me toned and fully fit, so it's obviously great for me to get another 90 minutes.

'Even though I haven't been playing games at the start of the season, I've still been working very, very hard getting myself fit. It's probably even more strenuous and harder work being injured and working yourself back up than it is playing.'

Sam Allardyce's side host Leicester on Saturday before travelling to Stamford Bridge to take on league leaders Chelsea on Boxing Day. Two days later they'll face another stern test in Arsenal before playing West Brom on New Year's Day. 

Sam Allardyce's side are currently fourth in the Barclays Premier League table 

The former Newcastle and Liverpool striker said he was 'raring to go' ahead of the festive fixtures
