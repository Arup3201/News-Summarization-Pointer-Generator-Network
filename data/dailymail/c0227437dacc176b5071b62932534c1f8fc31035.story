Tory Chris Heaton-Harris received £11,750 of Olympics-related gifts

Our attention may have been focused on the athletes, but it seems competition was also fierce among politicians during the Olympics.

MPs were handed thousands of pounds worth of free London 2012 tickets and hospitality thanks to the generosity of private sponsors.

According to the Commons register of MPs' financial interests, Tory Chris Heaton-Harris topped the chart after accepting £11,750 of gifts.

The former Euro MP and three family members attended swimming, diving and gymnastics events as well as the Closing Ceremony courtesy of Coca-Cola, which met the bill in full.

In second place was John Stevenson, the Tory MP for Carlisle, who received two tickets to unspecified events, plus hospitality, worth £5,500, from Nestle.

The bronze medal was shared between Labour MPs Sir Stuart Bell and former minister Hugh Bayley, who both declared tickets and hospitality worth £4,500.

Sir Stuart, the Middlesbrough MP who came under fire last year for failing to hold a constituency surgery for 14 years, declared 'one Category B ticket and hospitality' worth £4,500 from French oil firm Total, which allowed him to watch the Opening Ceremony.

York MP Mr Bayley received  a ticket to an athletics event on August 6, plus hospitality, worth £4,500 from Nestle.

Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, attended the Opening Ceremony with his wife courtesy of steel firm ArcelorMittal.

In the register,  he claimed that no value for the gift was provided to him.

A spokesman for the Taxpayers' Alliance pressure group said: 'Many people failed to get Olympics tickets so the idea that MPs waltzed into events free of charge is bound to cause anger.

'MPs should be careful about what corporate hospitality they accept and they should declare every penny of it.'

Many members of the public failed to get any tickets for the Olympic spectacle

Sebastian Coe is upset that football knocked the Games off the back pages

Lord Coe criticised newspapers yesterday for 'resorting to type' by allowing England's football triumph over lowly Moldova on Friday to bump the Paralympics off the back pages.

Most papers led their sports coverage with reports of England's 5-0 victory in the opening match of the World Cup qualifying campaign.

It came on a relatively barren day for Team GB, with Josie Pearson's victory in the discus Britain's only gold.

Her success came nine years after breaking her neck in a car accident, and the 26-year-old set three world records on her way to claiming the title.

Lord Coe said the press could help maintain the profile of Paralympic sport after the Games, and he criticised 'the speed with which we reverted to back-page leads for England-Moldova'.

He added: 'That relegation happened too quickly. We [the Paralympics Committee] could not have done more in the past seven years to move this on. It now sits in a large part with you guys.

'The speed with which we resorted to type was maybe not a great sign.'
