He is not the brightest dog in the world, according to his owners.

But with his big brown eyes and glossy coat, at least Teddy the English Cocker Spaniel could get by on his looks alone.

A YouTube video with 25,973 views shows the rescue dog attempting to retrieve his precious red ball from between the spokes of a kitchen chair.

Teddy the English Cocker Spaniel was captured on film failing to retrieve his ball from the back of the chair

His owner Darren Black is heard saying: 'There you go Teddy. Oh oh Teddy you almost had it. Have you given up?' 

For a gleaming moment he figures out how to go around to the front, but ultimately he was unsuccessful in his mission. 

Mr Black said: 'My wife and I rescued him a little over a year and a half. His red ball is his most prized possession. He takes it everywhere with him.

'This particular incident happened when I was doing homework. He came by and dropped it on the chair right next to me.

'He got impatient waiting for me to throw the ball with him, so he tried to get it back. As you can tell from the video, he was unsuccessful. He is not the brightest dog in the world.'
