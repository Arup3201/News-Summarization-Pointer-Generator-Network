Daniel and April Smith moved to Vilonia, Arkansas with their two young boys last fall, but last Sunday their beautiful life was rip apart as third-grader Cameron and first-grader Tyler Smith, were killed when the tornado destroyed the family’s home.

Their parents Daniel and April Smith were seriously injured.

The whole family were sheltering beneath a mattress in a bathtub last Sunday evening when the violent twister obliterated their home.

Faith: Last weeks Arkansas tornado provided many tales of both survival and grief. One mother, April Smith, who lost two sons to the storm but she still says she has kept her faith in God

Daniel suffered head trauma and is recovering at a separate Little Rock hospital from his wife.

Despite the incredible pain and suffering the family is having to endure, a visit to April's hospital by her friend Jessica Sowards has revealed a mother who has shown remarkable courage and forgiveness after everything she has had to endure.

Jessica took a photo of April laying in her hospital bed.

'Within 10 minutes of arriving at the hospital, I realized she was the same strong person, even stronger,' Ms. Sowards told Yahoo News.

'She said, ‘I’m going to miss them so bad, but I know that they’re OK. I don’t understand this, but I trust God.’'

Ms. Sowards, 28, spent part of her visit lying next to her friend, as the two cried.

Right for one another: Daniel and April Smith moved to Arkansas to start a beautiful family life together

Lost boys: First-grader Tyler Smith and third-grader Cameron Smith were killed Sunday when a tornado decimated their house in Vilonia, Arkansas

Perfect home, perfect life: The Smiths had the perfect family home in Arkansas

'She is in a tremendous amount of emotional pain,' Ms. Sowards said. 'But she is not in despair. There’s a difference, and the difference is Christ.'

Before leaving, Sowards asked Smith, 28, if she wanted her to take her photo in case she someday wanted to go public with how she persevered. The grieving mother agreed with one stipulation.

'Show them now,' Mrs Smith said from her hospital bed. “Show them what my God can overcome. Show them now.'

Wiped away: The house was simply blown away by the devastating force of the tornado

Blessings: April Smith's sons Tyler and Cameron were the light of their lives

Seeing the light: April, who leads her church¿s deaf ministry, cried tears of joy in her hospital bed on Thursday night

Ms. Sowards went home and blogged about her friend’s incredible optimism in the face of adversity.

'For those of you who have been worried about April and Daniel, worried that they would not be the same, that they could not carry on past this loss, please don’t worry any more. I have seen her hope. It is anchored in eternity. It is the kind of hope that saves people.

And that’s not just the optimist in me talking. For those of you wondering how a mother could serve a God that might allow this, understand that Tyler and Cameron knew Jesus.

Just a couple of weeks ago, they led a friend to Christ. They aren’t over. Their story hasn’t reached the end. They aren’t even really gone.

They’ve just moved for now. And we will miss them.

Like April told Tyler on his last day on earth, we will miss them until we see them again, April and Daniel more than any of us.

While none of us understand it, we must take up her lead and know that even still, God is good. And we must understand that while we may love these boys,

Divine intervention: April is a spiritual person and believes there is a reason that God broke her beautiful family apart

Devotion: April has devoted her life to the church and it seems her faith in The Lord is just as strong

God loves them infinitely more. He loves them perfectly. And with his knowledge of the lives and futures of the Smiths, God took them home.'

Her faith just lifted this huge weight of pain off of me, and I knew that I couldn’t keep that to myself,' she wrote.

Ms.Sowards put a link to her blog post on her Facebook wall. Within an hour, the story had 7,000 page views.

In two hours, it was 21,000. By the end of the day, it had grown to 400,000.

The post has now been viewed more than 1.5 million times.

'I thought I was writing for my friend to feel some relief,' Ms Sowards said.

She says she is getting inundated with messages from people who say the story has inspired them to make or renew their own spiritual connections.

April, who leads her church’s deaf ministry, cried tears of joy in her hospital bed Thursday night.

Tyler was 7.Cameron was 9. The boys loved baseball, fishing and God

Cameron also enjoyed hunting, getting his first crack during deer season last year

Family friend Eric Hancock said Tyler, 'was a pistol, with more energy than any 16 people I know.'

'He was just a light in the world,' he said.
