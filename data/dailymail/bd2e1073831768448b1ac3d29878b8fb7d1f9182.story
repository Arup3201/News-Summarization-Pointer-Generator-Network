AC Milan forward Jeremy Menez produced an outrageous piece of skill to break the deadlock in the Rossoneri's clash with Roma, only to see the linesman's flag rule his effort out.

The flag had already gone up before the Frenchman had even begun his pivot, but fans were still wowed as Menez defied logic to find then net from the tightest of angles.

The 27-year-old was enduring a frustrating night after being very isolated up front, especially after the dismissal of Pablo Armero, but he showed his class, even if it was all meaningless.

The ball heads away from goal before spinning back due to the slice Menez put on his effort

It just creeps over the line to complete the skill, but the offside flag meant it counted for nothing

Menez, who moved to Milan in the summer after being deemed surplus to requirements at Paris Saint-Germain, showed the San Siro what he could do in September, with an astounding back-heeled goal against Parma in a thrilling 5-4 victory.

With eight goals already, Menez has enjoyed a new lease of life after falling out of favour in the French capital.

And fans will be hoping that with such a repertoire of skills, Menez can help the fallen giant get back to challenging at the summit of Italian football.
