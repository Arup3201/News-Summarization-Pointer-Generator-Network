Pro-Russian rebels claim to have shot down a Ukrainian spy drone just a few miles from the site of the MH17 disaster.

The footage released on Youtube by the self-proclaimed Donetsk Peoples' Republic - which has not been independently verified - shows a military craft lying in a field near the rebel-dominated city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine.

Fighters posted an image  posing next to the device and making the peace sign on the Russian equivalent of Facebook, declaring themselves 'heroes'.

Heroes: The footage was posted along with a message proclaiming the fighters were heroes

If the footage's description is genuine, the site of the drone crash near the city of Shakhtars’k is just 15 miles from where MH17 was shot down over the village of Hrabove.

And the rebels claimed it happened at 1.30pm local time yesterday, just as international experts gathered at the MH17 crash site to search for evidence.

In a statement yesterday on vk.com, Russia's equivalent of Facebook, the separatists wrote: 'According to a report from military correspondents to the ministry of information, at approximately 13.30 near Shaktersk fighters of Motorola unit from number 20 check point on the Donetsk-Snezhnoe highway detected and shot down a Ukrainian flying object, supposedly a drone.

'Corsair reconnaissance group found the spot where it fell; right now the object is still at the crash site.'

The claim appeared to be backed up by Ukraine's military, according to the respected AFP news agency.

It reported Ukraine's military as saying separatists had hit an army drone with a missile similar to the type of system it alleges was used to strike MH17.

The claim prompted scorn on social media, though - as unlike the passenger jet, the drone appeared remarkably intact. 

And because the unmanned craft are rocket-launched, it could have come to earth following its mission using a parachute, as is normal for the same type of drone.

Comparison: One user of the social networking site posted this photograph of a Soviet-era Tu-143 drone

Close: The rebels said the site was near Shakhtars'k, about 15 miles from the MH17 crash site

Entered service: Late 1970s

Use: Soviet Union, East Germany

Crew: Unmanned

Wingspan: 7ft

Weight: 1.2 tonnes

Top speed: 590mph

Range: 124 miles

Service ceiling (high altitude): 16,400ft 

Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down on July 17, killing all 298 people on board.

It has still not been established how it was destroyed, though many politicians laid the blame at pro-Russian rebels which hold the area. 

But the circumstances are mired in confusion and even if rebels were to blame, it is not known if they knew what they were shooting.

Pro-Russians on the social networking site identified the downed drone, which bore the blue and yellow trident emblem of the Ukrainian military, as a Soviet-era spy craft.

They said it was a Tu-143 drone, a claim repeated by the Russian news outlet Russia Today, which reported on the video earlier today.

There are huge differences between the craft pictured and the passenger airliner.

It would have been flying much lower than the 33,000ft at which MH17 was flying, and unlike the passenger jet, it appeared unusually - remarkably - intact in the field, leading some to doubt the rebels' claims that they shot it down.

A rocket-launched short-range craft, Tu-143s were used by the Soviet Red Army in the 1970s and 1980s, and Russia Today claimed units were kept in use by Ukraine after the Soviet Union collapsed.

Footage of the craft posted by rebels showed its ageing machinery lying in the field near Donetsk

A statement by the rebels said: 'According to a report from military correspondents to the ministry of information, at approximately 13.30 near Shaktersk fighters shot down a Ukrainian flying object'

The footage was posted yesterday as the largest team of experts yet gathered at the site of the MH17 disaster.

Using sniffer dogs, the 101 experts - many of them from Australia and the Netherlands, where many victims hailed from - found new evidence including human remains.

Roads had for days been too dangerous to use because of heavy fighting, which frustrated the efforts to move an investigation forward.

And today the investigators were forced to seek cover again because of shelling, according to AFP.

Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said yesterday: 'The security situation at the site is unstable and unpredictable.'

In clashes near the site of the drone crash, Ukraine said separatists killed at least 10 of its paratroopers in an ambush in the early hours of yesterday.

A Ukrainian military official said a further 13 troops were wounded and 11 unaccounted for.

Today, meanwhile, Russia accused the EU of
 double standards, claiming it had lifted a ban on supplying Ukraine 
with military equipment 'on the quiet' while imposing sanctions on 
Moscow's military.

Relations between Moscow and Brussels have deteriorated since the EU imposed sanctions on Russia over its involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine.

The Russian Foreign Ministry has claimed the EU is under the thumb of the U.S. and called on EU leaders not to be 'goaded' by Washington over events in eastern Ukraine.

The EU passed its heaviest penalties on Moscow this week, imposing sanctions on Russia's defence, energy and financial sectors.
