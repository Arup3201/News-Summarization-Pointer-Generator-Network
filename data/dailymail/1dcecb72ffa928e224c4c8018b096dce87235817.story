Alastair Cook will get one more chance to prove he can turn England’s one-day fortunes around, after he was named as captain for the World Cup.

Speculation has been growing that the ECB could be forced to remove him as their one-day leader before the tournament, which starts in February, should a string of poor results continue to coincide with his own lack of runs.

But Cook’s captaincy was confirmed on Sunday, when England named a provisional 30-man party, which will shrink to a squad of 15 later this month.

Only resignation or injury will prevent him from leading out his side against Australia at Melbourne for their World Cup opener on Valentine’s Day.

But Sportsmail understands that England’s one-day policy will be rethought if Cook presides over another World Cup failure.

Not since 1992 have an English side mounted a serious challenge for the trophy, and a sixth successive flop will draw a line under the one-day careers of some of the senior players — including Cook, Ian Bell and possibly James Anderson.

Cook’s retention of the captaincy confirms the ECB’s belief that, having come through one of the most vitriolic summers an England skipper can ever have faced, he is the man most likely to repeat the trick in 50-over cricket.

Critics will argue that this is based more on hope than expectation. Either side of reaching the final of the 2013 Champions Trophy, England have lost five out of six bilateral one-day series — with the only victory coming under Stuart Broad’s leadership in the Caribbean earlier this year.

And Cook has not scored a hundred in 56 international innings — Tests and one-dayers — managing only 12 half-centuries in that time and an average of 29.

There is no place in the 30 for Jonathan Trott, who is yet to return to international cricket following his early departure from last winter’s Ashes with a stress-related illness.

But Surrey’s 24-year-old dasher Jason Roy is included, along with the talented Hampshire batsman James Vince and Yorkshire seamer Jack Brooks.

The decision to stick with Cook came only after a good deal of agonising but there was no appetite among the ECB hierarchy to sack their captain so close to the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. A tri-series tournament with Australia and India starts in Sydney on January 16.

The absence of viable alternatives has helped his cause. Eoin Morgan, who was due to captain the side in Sunday's fourth one-day international in Colombo following Cook’s suspension for slow over-rates, has been struggling for runs. Broad, meanwhile, has had injury problems and has been working his way back to fitness at a training camp in Potchefstroom in South Africa.

The mood around the dressing room here in Sri Lanka was subdued until Wednesday’s surprise win in Hambantota reduced the deficit to 2-1 in the seven-match series.

And wicketkeeper Jos Buttler, whose 37-ball unbeaten 55 finished the job in the company of Joe Root after a mid-innings wobble, insisted: ‘There’s a great buzz around the whole group, everyone communicates really well, everyone backs each other.’

‘The best preparation for a World Cup would be to win this series, and get that feeling of knowing how to win games.

‘You could probably tell the other night that we hadn’t won many games recently so we probably made it a bit harder for ourselves than we could have.’

The task now facing England — and Cook, when he returns – is to start stringing one-day victories together.

Joss Buttler said: 'There's a great buzz around the squad'
