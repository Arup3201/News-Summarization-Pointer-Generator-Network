Ex-police chief Bill Dowling was found shot dead at his home in Moonrakers, Devizes

The family of a retired police inspector found dead with his partner in an apparent double shooting say they had concerns about his 'emotional and mental wellbeing' in the weeks leading up to the tragedy.

Bill Dowling and his partner - named by Wiltshire Police today as Victoria Elaine Rose - were discovered at the property on the Moonrakers estate in Devizes on Saturday morning after neighbours alerted the police having heard gunshots.

Officers confirmed they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.

One neighbour said he believed Mr Dowling, 59, had a firearms licence and that he had been spotted in his shooting gear more frequently in recent months.

Today, a statement from Mr Dowling's family said they had recently developed concerns about the former police inspector.

In a statement released through police, they said: 'As a family we are trying to come to terms with the loss of a much-loved father and grandfather.

'During the last three weeks Bill's emotional and mental wellbeing have been in sharp decline and we are shocked and saddened by recent events.

'We are thinking of Vicky's family. We ask that you respect our privacy at this tragic time.'

Witnesses spoke of seeing blood on the glass door with the bodies fully visible to passers-by after three loud bangs were heard coming from the house on Saturday morning.

Miss Rose - known as Vicky - is thought 
to have been Mr Dowling's long-term partner but lived with her mother Val and
sons Matt and Jonathan less than half a mile from the scene of the incident.

A statement from Miss Rose's family said: 'On behalf of the family it is with great sadness that we issue a small statement regarding Victoria Rose.

'Mum, Victoria or Vicky was sadly taken away from us on Saturday. Words cannot describe how the family are feeling with this loss, for 
such a caring person and for anyone that knew her or had any contact 
with her, would know how she was always willing to help and chat to 
anyone.

'We have been so overwhelmed with messages of support in such a 
difficult time and we know how shocked people must be in hearing this 
sad news and still it doesn't seem quite real.

Speaking outside the three-storey property yesterday, where a police forensic van was parked outside, a family member said: 'It's a very hard time for us at the moment.'

Police say they are not looking for anyone else in connection with what they called an ‘isolated and tragic incident’.

Mr
Dowling, a divorced father of two, had recently returned from a 
month-long holiday to Australia on his own, according to a neighbour.

He was described as a friendly ‘gentle giant’ by acquaintances who said
they were mystified as to what lay behind the deaths on an estate in 
Devizes, Wiltshire.

A neighbour of Mr Dowling, who wished to remain unnamed, said: 'Vicky was lovely. They both were.

'I don't know what must have happened - they always seemed so happy whenever I saw them.'

Neighbours
on the 50-property cul-de-sac yesterday described their shock, with one
recalling how Mr Dowling had an interest in shooting pheasants. The 
neighbour, who asked not to be named, said he believed Mr Dowling had a 
firearms licence.

He said: 
‘I have known him for more than a decade and he was into shooting. I’d 
seen him load what looked like a big gun case into his car a few times. I
think he went pheasant shooting.

‘It was a big gun – it looked like it 
could have been a shotgun. He had long had an interest in shooting but 
over the last couple of months I saw him in his shooting gear a lot 
more.’

Another neighbour 
said: ‘I heard screams and then what I thought was a door slam. It must 
have been shots. We went to check on them and the porch was spattered in
blood.’

Detective Chief 
Inspector Ian Saunders from Wiltshire Police, where Mr Dowling worked 
for 30 years before retiring six years ago, said officers were alerted 
by neighbours who spotted the bodies. He added: ‘Exactly what led to 
this tragic incident is still being investigated.’

A
weapon was recovered from the scene, but police would not confirm the 
type of firearm or whether Mr Dowling was a registered gun owner.

Yesterday the youngest of Mr Dowling’s sons, James, 31, was too upset to comment.

But
from his home, less than half a mile away from the shooting, he said: 
‘I can confirm we have suffered a sudden death in the family. We are 
obviously grieving and we don’t want to say anything further at this 
time.’

Officers were keeping
guard at the entrance to Mr Dowling’s house, while forensic experts 
worked beneath a tent positioned at the front of the end-of-terrace 
property. The police cordon also enclosed a Skoda Fabia vRS hatchback 
parked outside.

Neighbour 
Sandra Nairn, 55, said of Mr Dowling: ‘He was lovely. We used to chat 
all the time. He’d always say hello – he said hello to everybody.

‘I
don’t know very much about Vicky, I just used to chat to her to say 
hello. They’d been together quite a while and seemed happy enough 
together. I last saw them last week and they were all smiles.’

Another
neighbour, Shirley Carr, 52, said she heard a commotion at around 
8.40am on Saturday. She said: ‘I heard the initial first bang, now I 
know it was a shot, it was so loud.

‘Then, no more than five minutes later, another two quieter bangs came. There were three in total.’

A
friend of Mr Dowling said: ‘I’ve known Bill for 18 years. He was a 
great guy. He was going out with a woman called Vicky, but they didn’t 
live together. She was in her early 50s, blonde and pretty attractive. 
She used to come and go. They seemed quite a happy couple.

‘He was a gentle giant. He was over six foot tall and was well known in the community.’

Mr Dowling was a station commander at Marlborough police station for nearly five years.

He left that role in 2004 and became a force operations room inspector in the control room in Devizes.
