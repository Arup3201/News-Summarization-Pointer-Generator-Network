After shivering in the coldest spring for 30 years, there was good news today at last with plenty of sunshine across the UK this Bank Holiday.

Although the weekend got off to a soggy start yesterday with rain and gales, forecasters say we are in for a warm respite which will last until Monday with temperatures climbing as high as 20C (68F).

Weather experts had predicted a Bank Holiday washout, but today the MeteoGroup said that after a chilly start with a touch of frost in Scotland and northern England, many parts of the UK will have a dry day with many sunny spells.

The outlook for Sunday and Monday will be another mainly dry and fine day across England and Wales with warm spring sunshine and few if any clouds.

Senior forecaster Paul Mott said: 'Thankfully we have a ridge of high pressure coming in from the south west, which for most people will give us some drier and warmer weather than we have had in recent days.'

Most parts of the UK apart from the Western Isles and western Northern Ireland will be dry today, he said.

There may be the odd shower in eastern parts of England and Northern Ireland and northwest Scotland are likely to see cloud and spots of rain.

Today much of the country will experience 
sunny intervals, with temperatures reaching 14C (57F) and highs of 18C 
(64F) in London.

‘Today will see a much better day with sunny spells,’ said Sarah Holland, of the Met Office.

‘In
the morning there is a chance of the odd shower in the South East, but 
most places will be dry and sunny with temperatures around 17C (63F) in 
London.

Tonight many areas will become clear 
and chilly overnight with mostly light winds bringing the chance of a 
touch of frost before warming up.

Monday's forecast for Scotland and 
Northern Ireland will see strengthening winds and heavy rain, initially 
affecting Scotland and Northern Ireland but edging into Wales and parts 
of England later. 

But it should stay  mostly fine in the far south-east of England. East Anglia and Kent will get the best of the weather, where 
temperatures could reach 20C but  cloud and rain will 
move across the country from the west later in the day.

Meanwhile, thousands of holidaymakers
are escaping the dismal British weather by flying to popular 
destinations in Spain, the Canary Islands,Turkey and North Africa.

But
some airline passengers are being affected by a backlog at London's 
Heathrow airport following the emergency landing yesterday by a British 
Airways jet which turned back shortly into a flight to Oslo.

Flourishing despite the cold: Apple tree blossom creates a pretty picture at orchards in Dorset today, but cider makers still need some warmer weather to ensure the trees bear fruit

Temperatures sank as low as 7C (45F) yesterday as severe weather warnings were issued in parts of the country.

High winds swept from the South West up to Yorkshire, making it feel even colder.

The
Met Office now believes this spring will be the coldest since 1979, 
with the mean UK temperature estimated at 6.1C (43F), well below the 
long-term average for this time of year of 7.7C (46F).

Hardy Britons refused to be deterred by the grim conditions, with 
millions taking to the roads yesterday to make the most of the getaway. But one incident caused a 12-mile tailbacks.

The
mixed weather appears to have left supermarkets in a quandary. Asda 
forecast sales of sausages to increase by 144 per cent and barbecue food
by 84 per cent, come rain or shine.

However,
bosses at the chain have also called in an extra 100,000 pairs of 
wellies ahead in case the weather takes a turn for the worse.
