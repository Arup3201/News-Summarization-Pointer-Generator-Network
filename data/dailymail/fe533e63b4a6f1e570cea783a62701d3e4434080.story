Gruesome sight: Relatives of Christina Hammond, who died in 2007, said a mortuary left her body in the open with blood sipping out of her mouth

A Washington state family claim that the same funeral home that made national headlines this week after allegedly cremating the wrong body also mishandled the remains of their deceased relative.

Brown Mortuary in Chehalis found itself in the center of a media storm after reports came out accusing the funeral home of mixing up the body of Jerry Moon with that of an elderly hospice patient, and then mistakenly cremating Moon in violation of his wishes.

For Tracy Scott and her daughter Carrie Hammond, the story hit close to home, reminding them of a traumatic experience they had at the mortuary after the death of Scott’s eldest daughter, Christina.

‘We feel their pain. We know their pain and we care,’ Miss Scott told KOMO News of Jerry Moon’s family. ‘These kind of mistakes just can’t happen.’

In 2007, 28-year-old mother Christina Hammond went in for a routine gallbladder surgery, which resulted in her death when her heart stopped while she was on the operating table.

When the family arrived at the mortuary ahead of Hammond's cremation, they said they were greeted by an arrogant employee who showed them no compassion in their hour of grief.

But the worst part came when Scott and Carrie Hammond approached Christina's body, only to discover a grisly sight.

‘She had blood running down her face and onto her shirt,’ Scott recalled. 'I went in and got the guy and he just laughed it off.’

Carrie said that even after her sister’s face had been wiped off, more blood continued trickling out of her mouth.

Miss Hammond said prior to that she 
had never been in a funeral home, but she is certain a person's body is 
not supposed to look the way her sister did in that moment.

‘It’s like a nightmare. That’s all you 
see,’ she said. ‘The viewing is supposed to have closure, and when a 
body looks that way...it’s no good.’

Following Miss Hammond's cremation, the family received her ashes from the mortuary along with a bag of jewelery.

The valuables, however, did not belong to the deceased woman, leaving her relatives to wonder if the funeral home had cremated the wrong body.

‘Did we just get somebody else's jewelry, or did we get somebody else's remains?’ Scott said.

Scott said she sent a complaint to Dignity Memorial, which owns Brown Mortuary, but did not receive a response. 

The revelations come just days after the family of Jerry Moon opened his casket to bid him a final farewell Monday, only to discover the body of a stranger with a plastic bag over his head.

The mix-up appears to have happened when Brown Mortuary took possession of Moon's body after his death.

Around that same time, the mortuary also took possession of the body of a 97-year-old man who died in hospice care. Somehow, the bodies were mixed up.

'This makes me feel like he was treated as a number, not a person,' daughter Cheryl Moon told KIROTV.com.

According to family members, Moon's funeral was a touching goodbye to the man they loved. At the end of the service, they opened the casket.

'I turned around and said to myself three times, '‘That’s not him, that’s not him, that’s not him,'” son Randy Moon told the station.

Inside the casket was the other man - dressed in Jerry Moon's clothes and with a picture of Moon's wife tucked under the pillow in the coffin.

Making things even worse, Moon was terrified of being cremated. But because of the mix-up, the funeral home cremated his body thinking it was that of the other man.

'The only other thing I can say is we know where he really is,' Randy Moon said. 'We’re a believing family, and we believe he is in heaven.'
