Questions: Jessica Chambers, 19, was found with burns on 98 per cent of her body on Saturday night

Police have added $10,000 to the reward for information that explains how and why a teenager was burned alive in a rural road in Mississippi last weekend.

Jessica Chambers, 19, was inexplicably doused with gasoline and set on fire on Saturday night. 

She was found barely alive by passers-by and died in hospital later that evening, with burns to 98 per cent of her body.

At a press conference on Thursday, District Attorney John Champion said they have spoken to 'many, many' people  but still feel like there is still a lot they do not know.

Now, as Chambers' family prepares for her funeral, the US Marshals Service has announced $11,000 will be handed to the person that can offer crucial information.

'There's just not a lot of street talk out there about who may or may not have done it,' he said. 'We feel like somebody out there has heard something.'

Speaking with Assistant District Attorney Jay Hale, they said there were some rumors circulating that were not true, including that Chambers was still on fire when she was found.

But it has emerged that the killer apparently got into the car before setting it alight. The teenager also had a large gash on her head.

To piece together the last few hours of her life, investigators continue to pore over surveillance footage from a gas station where she was seen 90 minutes before her death. They are also looking at her cell phone, which was left behind at the scene.

'We're leaving no stone unturned at this point,' Champion added. 'This is an absolute horrendous case... This situation is about as bad as it comes.'

Last moments: Jessica Chambers, 19, was caught on surveillance footage just 90 minutes before she was burned alive along the side of a rural road on Saturday. She is seen walking towards the store

Caught on camera: Jessica (seen left) then went into the shop and paid while three men chatted nearby

Scene: The gas station and convenience store Jessica visited before she was found severely burned along the side of a nearby road. The cashier claims Jessica told him she was 'going somewhere'

The gas station surveillance footage shows her climbing out of her car, walking across the forecourt and stopping to wave at a friend, before walking off camera. She then returns to the store to pay.

Convenience store manager Ali Fadhel, who served the teenager, told the Associated Press that Chambers came in frequently and he would often speak with her.

According to Fadhel, Chambers was wearing a dark-colored sweater and pajama pants that looked like sweatpants. Chambers said she was going to make a stop before going home, Fadhel said.

'If she knew she had a problem with somebody, she would have told me,' Fadhel said.

Chambers bought $14 worth of gas, more than the $5 or so she usually purchased, he said.

'I asked her, "Why are you putting so much gas?" She said, "I'm going somewhere",' Fadhel said.

Authorities have not commented on the claims.

On her way out, Chambers got a call on her cellphone, Fadhel said. When she left, she headed south on Highway 51, he said.

Questions: While she was inside, a man (seen top right) filled up a gas can close to her car (the dark vehicle in the center) but he has been cleared. After going inside the shop, she drove off

Terrifying: She had told her mother she was going out to get food when she and her car were set alight

Crime scene: Yellow crime scene tape marks the location where the 19-year-old  was found severely burned. Authorities are working to piece together the last hours of her life in efforts to catch who set her on fire

Grisly discovery: The teenager was barely conscious when first responders arrived to her car, which was on this bank, and she managed to whisper something - but authorities have not revealed what she said

About 90 minutes later, a motorist called 911 to report a burning car a mile away and first responders arrived to find the burned young woman. She was not covered in flames, as previously reported, authorities said at the press conference.

She whispered something to one of the fire officers. Investigators have not revealed what she said but indicated that the final words may help find her killer, WMC reported.

'She was able to communicate. It was difficult,' said Jay Hale, an assistant district attorney who prosecutes cases in Panola County. 

Peter Odom, an attorney who has prosecuted some arson cases, told HLN's 'Nancy Grace' that investigators will be assessing the physical appearance of suspects.

'They're looking for someone with singed eyebrows and maybe burned hands. Because the burner often gets burned,' he said.   

Plea: District Attorney John Champion pleaded for information as he spoke at a press conference on Thursday

Tragic: Two years before Jessica's death, her older brother Ben (right) was killed in a car crash

Authorities said initial autopsy results reveal the girl died from severe burns that covered 98 per cent of her body.

'I mean it's bad,' DA John Champion told Fox. 'I have been doing this for 21 years and as far as the means of death it is certainly the worst I have dealt with.'

Authorities are also looking into reports that she went to a party before her death, but they have said her appearance - pajama trousers and her hair in a bun - suggests she did not attend the party.

Friends said that the family can't think of anyone that might have wanted to hurt Jessica, who didn't have a boyfriend and was not known to have been seeing anyone.

They added that she had just started a new job at Goody's Department Store, which she loved.

Lisa Chambers, the girl's mother, begged with anyone to come forward with any information they may have about the heinous crime.

Heartbroken: Her mother, Lisa Chambers, sobbed as she pleaded with the public for information

Ripped apart: Her father Ben, pictured right, has also appealed for any information in her death

'They have ripped everything I have,' she told Fox. 'She left to go clean out her car and was going to get [herself] something to eat.' 

Amanda Prince, who identified herself as Jessica Chambers' older sister, told CNN Wednesday night that the family is 'shocked, lost ... confused, angry, hurt.' 

Asked if she knew of anyone who had a grudge against her sister or might want to hurt her, Prince replied, 'No one. She was loved by everybody. I don't know who would want to do this or why.'   

Mississippi authorities say they have received offers to help from several agencies, including the U.S. attorney's office and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.  

A candle-lit vigil will be held for Jessica on Saturday.  

Anyone with information on the murder should contact the Sheriff's Office at 662-563-6230.
