West Brom have rejected a transfer request from defender Craig Dawson.

Reports suggest the Baggies have refused the 24-year-old's request as new manager Alan Irvine assesses the squad he inherited from Pepe Mel.

He is the second West Brom player to be 
denied a move after George Thorne, who spent last season on loan at 
Watford and then Derby, received a similar response.

Unhappy figure: Defender Craig Dawson has had his transfer request rejected by West Brom

Dawson has been linked in recent weeks with a move to newly-promoted Burnley, and the arrival of Joleon Lescott at the Hawthorns will do little to enhance his chances of first-team involvement next season.

The Rochdale-born player, who joined the Baggies from his home-town club in August 2010, made 15 senior appearances last season, 12 of them the in Barclays Premier League with 10 of those starts.

However, for much of the campaign, he provided the back-up to Gareth McAuley and Jonas Olsson.
