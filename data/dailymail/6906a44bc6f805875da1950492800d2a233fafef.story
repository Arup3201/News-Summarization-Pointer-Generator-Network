They will always hold a special place in British seaside tradition, with picture postcards and donkeys.

But while beaches up and down the country were packed with deckchairs in the mid-20th century, they have experienced a steep decline since their heyday.

Now, an entrepreneur is taking 6,000 deckchairs out of storage in Lancashire in order to restore their original striped pattern - and make them available for hire.

Seaside heritage: Maria Hopwood has bought the seats from Blackpool Council - who withdrew them from beaches in 2004 to make the town feel more 'continental', but have only just decided to sell them

Maria Hopwood has bought the seats 
from Blackpool Council - which withdrew them in 2004 to make the town 
feel more ‘continental’, but has only just decided to sell them.

She told the Daily Telegraph:
 ‘We’re thrilled to be keeping these chairs in use. It would be an 
absolute travesty to lose this institution of the British summer.’

Ms
 Hopwood’s new business Heritage Deckchair Hire was launched seven years
 after she founded Deckchair Stripes, which sells replacement canvas for
 old deckchairs.

The 
company, based in Waverton, near Chester, Cheshire, took a revenue of 
£450,000 last year and now manufactures whole chairs in Britain.

Ms Hopwood added: ‘I was the person 
who introduced the deckchair back into Britain after they had been 
consigned to the shed with the arrival of plastic in the Sixties.

‘I’m the only one mad enough to bring back Blackpool’s chairs now.’

She said Blackpool Council did not have 
enough funds to restore the deckchairs, but held onto them for some time
 – until she heard that officials were finally ready to sell them last 
month.

Ms Hopwood said: ‘Until then, the 
council wouldn’t part with them for love nor money. To get them to 
relinquish a major asset like that was amazing.’

Until deckchairs were invented, people 
heading for the beach used to pay one old penny to sit on wooden benches
 dotted along the coastline.

But these were replaced by deckchairs, which were monitored by attendants who collected money from people on the beach.

Blackpool Council banked an astonishing £6million in cash from deckchair hire takings within a period of three years in the late Fifties.

But they declined soon after, following the invention of plastic chairs in the Sixties and the growth in availability of more affordable portable seating furniture.
