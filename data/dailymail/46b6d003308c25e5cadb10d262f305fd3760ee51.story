Ed Miliband likes to portray himself as a man of the people, emphasising his humble origins as the comprehensive-school educated son of immigrants.

But only days after dodging questions about his personal wealth and sneering at David Cameron’s fortune, it has emerged that the Labour Party leader is so rich he can afford to live in a £2.3million house – with a £400,000 mortgage.

Land Registry documents also show the Milibands have remortgaged their house in north London with Barclays, the bank he savaged for its role in the interest-rate rigging scandal.

In his leader’s speech at his party conference on Tuesday, Mr Miliband attacked the Prime Minister for his personal wealth while lambasting him for reducing the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p.

He said: ‘Next April, David Cameron will be writing a cheque for £40,000 to each and every millionaire in Britain . And here’s the worst part. David Cameron isn’t just writing the cheques. He is receiving one. He’s going to be getting the millionaires’ tax cut.’

The Labour leader underlined his class-war tactics in a party political broadcast contrasting his comprehensive school education with that of Eton-educated Mr Cameron.

But Mr Miliband is far from poor. He lives in a house, in the name of his wife Justine Thornton, which is worth up to £2.3million – a rise of £700,000 in the three years since it was purchased.

Miss Thornton is an environmental law expert on around £200,000 a year, while Mr Miliband earns more than £130,000.

He is also wealthy because of an inheritance from his Marxist father Ralph and his share of the value of the former family home. He used this money and the proceeds of a flat he bought in the 1980s for £100,000 to purchase a house in Hampstead for £650,000. In 2009 he sold this for £740,000.

At the same time, Miss Thornton sold her home for £630,000, and the pair combined their resources to buy their townhouse for £1.6million. Mr Miliband contributes to the loan repayments, but his name is not on the deeds.

Documents show Miss Thornton switched the mortgage from Clydesdale Bank to Barclays in September.

It is likely the couple will have negotiated reduced monthly repayments in a new deal, concluded just last week as Mr Miliband prepared for the Labour Party conference in Manchester.

In the summer, Mr Miliband repeatedly called for the resignation of former Barclays boss Bob Diamond after revelations about the extent of the Libor-rigging scandal at the bank.

He went further than any other politician, calling for a criminal investigation and a judge-led inquiry into the banking industry, saying: ‘We need the strongest punishment.’  The day after his conference speech, Mr Miliband faltered on TV when he was asked about his own wealth. He insisted: ‘I am not going to be getting the top-rate tax cut.’

It came as Conservative MP Rob Wilson dubbed him ‘Millionaire Miliband’ after claiming his home was worth £2million.

Property experts estimate the four-bedroom semi-detached family home is worth more than that. A similar house in the same road is on the market for £2.3million.

A Labour source said: ‘The point Ed Miliband is making is not that it is wrong to be wealthy. The point he is making is: if the Prime Minister is bringing in a millionaires’ tax cut, he should say whether he stands to benefit from it.’
