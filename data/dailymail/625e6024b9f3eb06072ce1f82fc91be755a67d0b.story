J.K Rowling's Harry Potter books could be losing their appeal with today's children according to the latest library borrowing figures.

The adventures of the boy wizard do not even feature in a list of the top ten authors borrowed by children.

Children this year preferred to borrow books by Daisy Meadows who came in at number one with her Rainbow Magic series.

The launch of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in 2007: However a list of most borrowed children's books has not included the series for the first time since its launch

Number two was Julia Donaldson whose best-known book is The Gruffalo.

Her work is popular the world over and has been turned into animated films and a stage production.

Also popular was the Horrid Henry stories by Francesca Simon, Horrible Histories by Terry Deary and books by Tracey Beaker author Jacqueline Wilson.

This is the first year that books by J.K Rowling have not made it into the top ten.

The Harry Potter series has dominated the chart since the first book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was published in 1997.

1. Daisy Meadows - Rainbow Magic series

2. Julia Donaldson - The Gruffalo

3. Francesca Simon - Horrid Henry

4. Jacqueline Wilson - The Story of Tracey Beaker

5. Mick Inkpen - Kipper the Dog and Wibbly Pig

6. Adam Blade - Beast Quest and Sea Quest series

7. Terry Deary - Horrible Histories series

8. Fiona Watt - That's Not My...

9. Roald Dahl - Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and numerous other titles

10. Ian Whybrow - Harry and the Dinosaurs and others

Stories by Charlie and the Chocolate Factory author Roald Dahl, another surefire hit of the past, barely make it into the top ten coming in at number nine.

While Enid Blyton, who wrote the Noddy series of books as well as hits including, The Famous Five and The Faraway Tree only made the long list coming in at number 14.

But the classic authors still have staying power in other charts.

Both Dahl placed first, and Blyton 
placed second in the list of most borrowed classic author ahead of 
Agatha Christie and Jane Austen.

The list was compiled by Public Lending Right (PLR), part of the British Library.

PLR is responsible for collecting payments for registered authors who have their books in libraries around the UK.

Jim Parker, head of PLR, told The Telegraph: 'Some of the works that have endured are those that seem timeless.

'There
 are books which could have been written in the 1970s or yesterday and 
you cannot tell. You canâ€™t say that for all the books.'

Books by Roald Dahl, which include the BFG, Matilda and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory reached number 9 in the list
