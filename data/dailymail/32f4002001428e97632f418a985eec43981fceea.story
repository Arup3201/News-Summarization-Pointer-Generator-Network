A huge piece of the Chelyabinsk meteorite, which crashed into Russia earlier this year, has gone on display at a local museum.

The meteor fireball exploded over the Ural Mountains in February causing a shock wave that smashed windows, damaged buildings and injured 1,600 people.

A 600kg rock, believed to be one of the largest pieces of this meteorite, is currently being exhibited at the Chelyabinsk Regional History Museum in the Southern Urals.

A 600kg fragment of the Chelyabinsk Meteorite at the Chelyabinsk Regional History Museum is shown here. The chunk was recovered from the bottom of Chebarkul Lake, some 60km west of Chelyabinsk. The meteorite exploded over Chelyabinsk Region in February 2013

The chunk was recovered from the bottom of Chebarkul Lake, some 60km west of Chelyabinsk, following a recovery operation last week.

The meteorite broke up into multiple pieces as it entered the atmosphere, scattering space debris and creating a shock wave estimated to be as strong as 20 Hiroshima atomic bombs.

Live
footage on Russian TV showed a team pull out a 1.5-metre-long (five-foot-long) rock 
from the lake after first wrapping it in a special casing while it was 
still underwater.

Chelyabinsk, 900 miles east of Moscow and close to the Kazakhstan border, took the brunt of the impact

A meteor that blazed across southern Urals in February was the largest recorded meteor strike in more than a century.

More than 1,600 people were injured by the shock wave from the 
explosion, estimated to be as strong as 20 Hiroshima atomic bombs, as it
landed near the city of Chelyabinsk.

The
fireball measuring 18 meters across, screamed into Earth's atmosphere 
at 41,600 mph. Much of the meteor landed in a local lake called 
Chebarkul.

Other than the latest find, scientists have already uncovered more
than 12 pieces from Lake Chebarkul since the February 15 incident. 
However, only five of them turned out being real meteorites.

The rock broke up into at least three 
large pieces as scientists began lifting it from the ground with the 
help of levers and ropes.

The scale itself broke the moment it hit the 570-kilogramme (1,255-pound) mark.

‘The rock had a fracture when we found it,’ one unnamed scientists told the lifenews.ru website in a live transmission.

‘It weighed 570 kilogrammes before the pieces fell off. And then the scale broke,’ said the scientist.

‘We think the whole thing weighs more than 600 kilogrammes,’ he said. 

The Vesti 24 rolling news channel 
reported that divers had already recovered more than 12 pieces from Lake
Chebarkul since the February 15 incident.

The station cautioned that only four or five them turned out being real meteorites.

Last week, scientists recovered what could be giant chunk of the Chelyabinsk meteor from the bottom of the lake it crashed into in the Urals, Russia

The meteor fireball that crashed into Russia in February was part of a 656-foot wide asteroid called 2011 EO40.

The fireball measuring 18 meters across, screamed into Earth's atmosphere at 41,600 mph.

Six fragments of the meteorite have already been handed over to National Museum of Natural History in Paris.

In
August, NASA satellites made the unprecedented measurements of the 
meteor which is thought to have released 30 times more energy than the 
atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.

Spanish
astrophysicists analysed fragments of the meteor that were scattered 
across the Russian town of Chelyabinsk, where the meteor landed, and 
claim it came from the large Apollo asteroid that regularly crosses 
passed Earth as it orbits the sun.

They
added that the piece may have broken off because of the stress caused 
by the gravitational pull of the planets and the sun, or could have been
caused by the asteroid hitting into something else during its orbit.

Satellite data from Nasa has revealed that that four days after the bolide explosion, the faster, higher portion of the plume (red) had snaked its way entirely around the northern hemisphere and back to Chelyabinsk in Russia
