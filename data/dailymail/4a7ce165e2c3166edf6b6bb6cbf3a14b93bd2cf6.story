It has been one of London's most familiar sights for more than a century, as instantly recognisable to visitors as the red telephone box or the Tube stop.

But whether the distinctive black cab will continue to come off the assembly line in years to come is now in question.

Coventry-based manufacturer Manganese Bronze, which makes the London taxi, is to appoint administrators and faces an uncertain future.

Warning light? The maker of the distinctive London taxi is to appoint administrators after it failed to secure a funding boost from one of its largest shareholders

The group made the announcement after it failed to secure a funding boost from one of its largest shareholders.

Manganese
 was reportedly in talks with Chinese private car maker Geely, which 
owns a 20 per cent stake in the firm, over a £15million loan.

But the group said it had been unable to secure funding with various parties and will bring in administrators.

It said it 'remained hopeful' that the business would survive.

 taxis first appeared in London at the end of the 19th century. There 
are now more than 20,000 licensed cabs serving the capital.

The decision to appoint administrators comes after a torrid few months for Manganese, which employs almost 300 staff in its London Taxi Company division.

Earlier this month, the group recalled 400 black cabs due to a steering box fault.

It
 said it had discovered a defect with new steering boxes in its TX4 
models, which were introduced in production at its Coventry factory in 
late February.

The
 fault came to light after two cab drivers reported problems with 
steering, although there had been no crashes or injuries as a result.

Manganese has been trying to contact drivers of the affected vehicles to make sure they are taken off the road.

Before
 the administration announcement, it had warned that recalling and 
suspending sales of the vehicle would have a 'material and detrimental' 
impact on its cashflow.

In
 its statement today, Manganese said that the group would continue to 
operate during the administration process and a 'speedy' resolution of 
the recall remained a top priority.

Manganese Bronze traces its roots to the 19th century as a maker of ship propellers.

It has also produced motorcycles and, through its London Taxi Company division, is universally recognised for providing the UK with the black cab.

As well as its Coventry manufacturing facility, the division has six wholly-owned retail sites and has more than 60 service dealers supporting the network across the UK.

Manganese recently reported group-wide half-year losses of £3.6 million.

The
 group said it 'remains hopeful that the fundamental strengths of the 
company, the TX4 model and its global reputation will provide the 
platform for a successful business in the future'.

Manganese
 has been loss-making for the past four years as its London Taxi arm has
 been hit by a consumer spending slowdown and increased rivalry from 
competitors, such as Eco City vehicles.

The
 group’s London Taxi Company division makes about 2,700 cabs a year and 
has produced more than 100,000 since 1948.

Its newest model, the TX4, was launched in October 2006.

Earlier
 this month, Manganese boss John Russell vowed to keep the troubled 
group's meter running but warned that it was in a 'very uncertain 
situation'.

He said he would do everything possible to prevent the company from going under.

‘We’re
 focused on making sure that doesn’t happen,’ he said at the time. 
'Clearly we’re in a very uncertain situation and until we get more 
accurate analysis we can’t answer that question.'

Mr Russell,
 the former boss of Harley Davidson in Europe, said investors had every 
right to feel aggrieved by the product recall situation and added that 
he shouldered full responsibility.
