Gemma Harvieu, 29, walked free from court after being given a suspended jail sentence for wiring cash to wanted fugitive Andrew Moran

A 'gangster’s moll' who helped one of Britain’s most wanted fugitives while he was on the run in Spain has walked free from court.

Former Selfridge’s beautician Gemma Harvieu, 29, wired cash from the UK to career criminal Andrew Moran, 31, who fled to Spain after vaulting the dock of a courtroom while on trial over an armed robbery at a supermarket.

A court heard how Harvieu joined him at a string of exotic locations before he was dramatically arrested by Spanish police while sunbathing 
at his villa in Alicante.

In the space of just one year she was said to have made 23 visits to Alicante. She also took trips to Paris, Vienna, Pisa, skied in the Alps and would shop on London's Bond Street.

All the while she was earning a modest wage on the cosmetics counter of Selfridges at the Trafford Centre in Manchester.

Harvieu, of High Lane, Chorlton, went on
trial this week on charges of assisting an offender and money 
laundering which she initially denied as she claimed she was unaware her
boyfriend was a fugitive despite extensive national and local 
publicity.

But she changed her pleas to guilty on Wednesday at Preston Crown Court and today received a 12-month jail sentence, suspended for two years.

In
admitting transferring more than £3,600 for subsistence to Moran, Mr 
Justice Turner said a custodial sentence was inevitable but he noted she
had not been to jail before and had effectively already served a 
12-month term after being on remand since June.

He explained they were relatively small sums and that it was clear that Moran had other sources of income he had relied upon.

Mr
Justice Turner said: 'Helping criminal careers is a very serious 
matter, so serious in the set of circumstances that we meet in this 
case.

'There can be no 
justification for funding criminals like Andrew Moran. The message must 
go out to the public that these sort of offences must not be condoned or
tolerated.'

He pointed out though that Harvieu would be out of prison in a couple of weeks if he did not suspend the sentence. She was also ordered to complete 300 hours of unpaid work.

Moran, 31, of Salford, had been on Crimestoppers’ most wanted list of criminals believed to be on the run in Spain.

He
flew out of Manchester Airport on a false passport the following day 
after he escaped custody at Burnley Crown Court in March 2009 where he 
was eventually convicted in his absence of conspiracy to commit armed 
robbery.

He remained on the run for four years in Spain before he was finally arrested by police.

Moran’s sister Simone Moran, 27, and her
fiance Jason Fitzgerald, 28, both of Edenbridge Drive, Radcliffe, 
received the same sentences as they both pleaded guilty at earlier 
hearings to assisting an offender.

They too wired similar sums of cash to Moran while he was in Spain.

Last
month, a fourth defendant, Leighton Craft, 39, of Parkhill, Prestwich, 
was sentenced to eight months imprisonment, suspended for 12 months, 
after he previously admitted making an untrue statement to procure a 
passport.

Michael Bagley, 
defending Harvieu, said his client was no longer in a relationship with 
Moran, whom she said she had met in Spain by chance.

As well as being ruthless and cunning, he was also manipulative and charming, said the barrister.

He said: 'The long and short of it is that he took in Miss Harvieu. She fell in love with him. Once in that relationship, she let herself down and members of her family.'

She was ashamed at her actions and had felt 'humiliated' by the caricature of her being a 'gangster’s moll', he said.

'She is emotionally disengaged with Andrew Moran,' Mr Bagley continued. 'One hopes and trusts that is right.'

Mark
Ford, representing both Simone Moran and Fitzgerald, said they too were
manipulated by Moran, although some sense of family obligation may have
played its part.

Wendy 
Chappell, senior Crown prosecutor for CPS North West, said: 'It was the 
prosecution case that these defendants were well aware that Andrew Moran
was wanted by law enforcement agencies in the UK, yet on various 
occasions they transferred money over to him so that he could carry on 
living in Spain.

'The evidence
showed that Gemma Harvieu regularly visited Moran in Spain whilst he 
was unlawfully at large, holidaying with him throughout Europe and 
enjoying all the trappings of a luxury lifestyle from money which had no
legitimate source.

'The CPS 
has worked closely with the police to bring them all to justice. We are 
determined to ensure that criminals do not evade the law and anyone who 
assists them in doing so can expect to be prosecuted.'

The court previously heard how Moran had been the gunman in a raid on a Royal Mail van outside the Asda supermarket in Colne, Lancashire, where £25,000 was stolen.

And while in Spain he took to crime there like 'a duck to water', Preston Crown Court heard today.

In November 2012, Moran displayed 'a spectacular piece of behaviour' when he evaded arrest from the Spanish authorities as they set up an armed security cordon around his then flat.

He smashed his 4x4 vehicle through the police block and then sped off along the wrong way of the motorway.

Evidence of a luxury lifestyle was uncovered when officers searched his address, as well as loaded firearms, a stash of cannabis and a series of false identity documents which Moran was using on 'a persistent basis'.

Prosecutor Tim Brennand said details linking him to Harvieu - whom he labelled as a 'gangster’s moll' - were also found, including travel documents surrounding the purchase of an expensive pedigree pitbull dog from Austria.

More firearms, ammunition and two machetes - one under his bed - were recovered in this year’s arrest in Alicante with Moran suspected to be involved in a high-level conspiracy to supply cocaine.

He is currently in custody in Spain and is awaiting trial in January.
