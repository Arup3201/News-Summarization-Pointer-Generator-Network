A girl who was just 10 years old when she was charged with killing a baby in her mother's care pleaded guilty on Wednesday to several misdemeanors in a plea deal.

A judge signed off on the deal which dropped manslaughter charges against Kelli Murphy, now 12, in a closed-door hearing. As part of the deal, Murphy will submit to a treatment plan and remain in the custody of the Maine Department of Health and Human Services until she turns 18.

'I'm
 satisfied with the outcome. It was the best that we could accomplish 
given the complexities of the case and the age of the juvenile,' Deputy Attorney General William Stokes said.

Murphy was first charged in the death of 3-month-old Brooklyn Foss-Greenway in July 2012.

The charges stem from a night in which the baby stayed over at Murphy's house with Murphy's mother babysat the infant. 

An autopsy and toxicology performed on the baby found 
large quantities of the same prescription medication Murphy took to control her Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

The deal comes after the baby's mother Nicki Greenaway called for charges against Murphy's mother Amanda Huard.

She said the woman was neglectful in watching Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway, and that she should be held liable for her conduct.

The state disagreed.

'Legally speaking, it’s not possible,' Stokes said. 'One of the things we have to prove in any death is causation, and we don’t have any evidence that [Huard] caused anybody’s death.'

The juvenile petition against Murphy 
contained no additional details about the case, including Brooklyn's cause of death, but the baby's mother, Nicki Greenaway, claims to have been told her child was suffocated.

When Greenaway saw her daughter for the first time at a funeral home, the baby had a black eye, bruises on her nose and marks that looked like fingerprints on her cheeks, she said.

'Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway has died as a result of your neglect,' said a notice delivered to the mother in the weeks after her child's death. 'You knew that (the 10-year-old) should not be babysitting children but have continued to allow her to do so.'

Murphy had already been labeled as a 
danger to children before Foss-Greenaway's death, according to documents from the DHHS which detail 
that she suffers behavioral problems, including oppositional defiant 
disorder, ADHD and attachment 
disorder.

Former tenants of Huard's house also claimed Murphy also harmed their baby.

Ashley Tenney and Chad Hopkins have 
named the 10-year-old as being responsible for their daughter's 
hospitalisation in June, brought on by sudden seizures.

Doctors found the same medication in eight-month-old Jaylynn's system that is used by the accused girl to control her attention deficit hyperactivity disorder after they had been left alone together. 

Tenney and Hopkins were living with in the basement of Huard's home, the Maine Sunday Telegram reported.

They say the girl was alone with 
their daughter in June 2012, while Hopkins was elsewhere in the house and 
Tenney was out at work.

The
 couple trusted the girl, they said, that she had shown a 'healthy 
interest' in their daughter up until that point, offering to help with 
diaper changes and bathing.

When Tenney arrived home from her shift at Dunkin' Donuts she found her daughter pale and sweating.

'She was soaked in sweat, just drenched,' said Tenney, 20. 'She was so pale. Whiter than a sheet of paper.'

As they rushed her to the emergency room at MaineGeneral Medical Centre in Waterville, Jaylynn began convulsing and fitting. 

'She
 was on her father's lap, and her head just dropped back, and she 
rapidly started shaking,' Tenney said. 'The first one lasted like 20 
seconds.'

The sudden seizures baffled doctors at first as they struggled to work out what had brought them on.

Medical experts consulted one another and Jaylynn was transferred to Maine Medical Centre in Portland to be reassessed.

'If her head went to the left her arm
 went to the right and vice versa,' she said. 'Her heart rate was high 
and they were worried and didn't know what to do for her.'

In
 Portland doctors probed Tenney about what medications were in Huard's 
house, matching up the 10-year-old's attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder drugs with what they found in Jaylynn's system.

So
 much was detected, Tenney said, that her daughter 'should have been 
dead'. She added that there 'wasn't any way' she could have ingested the
 medication on her own.

In
 the days following the scare, Tenney and Hopkins began looking for a new
 place to live, sickened by the belief that Huard's daughter had 
deliberately hurt their own.

She
 said she had found a canvas bag in a drawer in the 10-year-old's 
bedroom, filled with more than 100 photographs of Jaylynn, some torn, 
others with words like 'my baby girl' written on them.

The
 couple were interviewed by workers from the DHHS Office of Child and 
Family Services, as were with the 10-year-old and her mother. All four 
were told that the girl should not be given care of young children.

But despite the warnings the girl was once again left alone with a toddler just three weeks later, this time with three-month-old Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway whose mother, Nicki, had left in Huard's care overnight.
