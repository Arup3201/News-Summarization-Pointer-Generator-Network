A 10-year-old boy was suspended after he pretended to shoot an imaginary bow and arrow at his classmate, the family's attorney said this week.

Johnny Jones was disciplined after he playfully responded to his friend's imaginary gun duel during class in October, by making an imaginary bow and arrow using his pencil.

Johnny was reported by a girl in his class at the South Eastern School District West in Pennsylvania.

Johnny Jones, 10, was suspended from South Eastern School District West in Pennsylvania for shooting an imaginary bow and arrow in October

Following a lecture by their teacher, Johnny and the other boy were suspended for one day under the school district's zero-tolerance policy against weapons and their school records marked to say they had violated it. 

MailOnline was awaiting a response from Principal John Horton and Superintendent Dr Rona Kaufmann at the school.

The parents of Johnny Jones are considering legal action and want their son's school record expunged.

The family's attorney John Whitehead, from the Rutherford Institute, said today: 'We all want to keep the schools safe, but I’d far prefer to see something credible done about actual threats, rather than this ongoing, senseless targeting of imaginary horseplay.'

The Rutherford Institute has asked that the school remove the incident from the ten-year-old's permanent record.

The school district has until Friday to make a decision on the incident.

According to the South Eastern School District’s Zero Tolerance policy for 'Weapons, Ammunition and other Hazardous Items' the school bans possession of guns, knives and other instruments that can be used to harm. 

It also bans students from carrying replica or lookalike weapons - but makes no mention of the imaginary.
