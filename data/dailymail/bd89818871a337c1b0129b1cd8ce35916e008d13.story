Detectives hunting a teenage girl who vanished in suspicious circumstances more than seven years ago today charged a man with her murder.

Robert Ewing, 59, and another suspect were arrested earlier this week in connection with the disappearance of Paige Chivers on August 23, 2007.

Paige was 15 when she vanished after a row with her father at their seaside home in Blackpool, Lancs. Despite appeals from police, the youngster's distraught family and TV chat show host Jeremy Kyle plus the offer of a Â£12,000 reward no trace of her has ever been found.

During the inquiry Paige 'inherited' thousands of pounds on what would have been her 18th birthday from a trust fund set up following the death of her mother Sheila who died of a heart attack aged 48 - six months before the youngster vanished.

The investigation into Paige's disappearance is now being treated as a 'murder without a body.'

Today
 Lancashire Police said Ewing of Blackpool, had been charged with murder
 and doing a series of acts with the intent to pervert the course of 
justice.

Paige - who 
attended Montgomery High School in Blackpool - lived with her late 
father, Frank, 46, a builder and brother, Jack, but was 'very troubled 
and angry' over her mother's death.

She left the family home 24 hours after an argument over the phone with her father over the spending of some family cash.

Paige
 packed her belongings in her purple suitcase and left home on 23 
August. Police believe after leaving home, she went to the home of a 
middle aged man in the nearby village of Bispham to whom she had been 
introduced by a teenage pal.

The
 man was said to have told Paige that she could not stay at his home. He
 claims he walked her to a nearby bus stop and told her to go to a local
 drop-in hostel for troubled children in Blackpool. But she never 
arrived and has not been seen since.

Disappearance: The inquiry into what happened to Paige remains the most heavily-resourced major investigation in Lancashire Police's history

The last confirmed sighting of her by her family was that day getting on a number 11 bus.

Detectives
 received a letter from a mystery person who claimed to know what had 
happened to the teenager. Police did not reveal the contents of the 
anonymous note but urged the person who sent it to get in touch. During 
the inquiry three men and a woman were arrested on suspicion of Paige's 
murder - but all were released without charge.

The
 enquiry remains the most heavily resourced major investigation in 
Lancashire Police's history with more than 2,800 people spoken to as 
part of the inquiry and over 1,200 statements taken.

The
 investigation has been extended to Peterlee in the North East and the 
Bolton area where Paige is known to have friends plus Nottingham, 
Sheffield, Croydon and the South Coast of England. Police frogman have 
searched a lake and ponds in the Blackpool area.

During
 a 2010 appeal when Paige would have turned 18, sister Maddison Houghton
 who gave birth to a son Connor just days after the teenager vanished 
said, 'All my brothers and sisters are all missing Paige like crazy, and
 we want her to come home. Paige's very out going, she just loved 
everybody, and very caring. You could hear her from everywhere - you 
could hear her half way down the street.

'When
 our mum died Paige couldn't handle things and she kept it all inside, I
 think she probably just couldn't talk about it and decided to go.

'We
 just need her to come home so we can scatter my mum's ashes and we 
don't want to do that without her. I really want her to meet Conner 
because he's her nephew and she hasn't seen him and she'd adore him.

'She
 had some money inherited in my mum's will which she can get on her 18th
 birthday. I just want to make sure and let her know that it's safe and 
in the bank and ready for her when she comes home.'

Earlier this week Lancashire Police confirmed: 'Following
 consultation with The Crown Prosecution Service two men are due to 
appear in court in connection with the murder of Paige Chivers.

'Robert
 Ewing, 59, of Kincraig Place, Blackpool is charged with murder and 
doing a series of acts with the intent to pervert the course of justice.'

Gareth Dewhurst, 
45, also of Blackpool, has appeared in court charged with assisting an offender, doing a 
series of acts with intent to pervert the course of justice and sexual penetration of a corpse.

Both he and Ewing were remanded in custody to next appear at Preston Crown Court on September 30.

A 29-year-old man from Blackpool arrested on suspicion of attempting to pervert the 
course of justice has been released on police bail pending further 
enquiries.
