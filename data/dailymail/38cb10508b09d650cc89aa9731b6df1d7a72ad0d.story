Passengers on board a Qantas flight started vomiting and oxygen masks dropped from overhead when their plane was forced to abort a landing and suddenly increase altitude to avoid hitting a Virgin flight that was on the runway preparing to take off.

The Qantas Boeing 717 flight carrying 95 passengers was 150 metres from landing at Darwin Airport after flying from Alice Spring on Tuesday evening. 

A catastrophic accident was avoided when the Qantas plane was told by air traffic control that a delayed Virgin flight was taking off - forcing the Qantas flight to pull up suddenly.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Virgin Airlines and Qantas for comment. 

A source told NTnews.com.au that  it felt 'like the wheels were down' but then suddenly the plane was climbing real quick and the masks were down and people were spewing'.

The Department of Defence, which controls air traffic at Darwin Airport, confirmed that 'QJE1938 was sent around to maintain the safe seperation of aircraft, due to a delay by the preceding Virgin aircraft'. 

The statement said that Australian Transport Safety Board will not need to investigate the incident as air controllers followed procedures required to avoid an incident. 

The drama comes after another near-miss at Newcastle Airport, which is also controlled by Defence, raising questions about whether civilian air traffic controllers should direct planes in the area, which is close to a RAAF base.
