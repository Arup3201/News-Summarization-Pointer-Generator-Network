Grassroots clubs are missing out on millions of pounds from the transfer of their former players.

That is the fear of Wallsend Boys Club chairman, Steve Dale. His club benefited from the £2million transfer of Fraser Forster from Newcastle to Celtic in 2012 and have now landed another payment in light of his £10m move to Southampton in August.

The windfall is all part of the ‘solidarity contribution’ mechanism set out in the FIFA Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players.

Wallsend Boys Club is one of the country’s most famous talent factories and had the likes of Alan Shearer, Peter Beardsley and Michael Carrick on their books

But because junior clubs have to make an application for their entitlement to the buying club within 18 months of the deal, Dale believes that millions could be going unclaimed by junior clubs worldwide.

‘I'd query how many junior clubs are actually aware of the regulations and what they could be entitled to,’ he told Sportsmail.

‘It's always great to see former players go on to bigger things and everyone at the club is absolutely delighted to see Fraser playing at the top of the game, we all wish him well.

‘At the same time, if the clubs which played a part in his early career can benefit in some small way from his move, this makes a huge difference to the young people we look after week in, week out.’

Wallsend were entitled to payment from the transfer of Forster from Newcastle to Celtic in 2012 and from Celtic to Southampton last summer because the deals were made between different football associations

Wallsend Boys Club chairman Steve Dale fears grassroots clubs could be missing out millions by not claiming money they are entitled to

English clubs only receive the payment when a player moves between clubs registered in different football associations (ie international transfers) and a fee is involved, as was the case with Forster when he swapped Scotland for England last month. It does not apply to domestic deals.

Five per cent of every transfer fee between clubs in different associations is set aside to be distributed to any club – including professional - to which the player was registered between the seasons of their 12th and 23rd birthdays. The amount received is proportional to the time spent under their care, which is recorded on a ‘player passport’.

For example, if a £10m player spent just one season at a junior club they would land around £25,000.

Going forward, it could be an invaluable source of future income for the likes of Wallsend, who had England goalkeeper Forster on their books until he joined Newcastle at 15.

The club is one of the country’s most famous talent factories and more than 70 of their youngsters have gone on to play professionally, including Alan Shearer, Peter Beardsley, Michael Carrick, Steve Bruce and Lee Clark.

And, of their famed alumni, Dale added: ‘Unfortunately, not many of them played abroad! 

‘It's increasingly hard for grassroots clubs at all levels to raise funds each year, so if any are fortunate enough to have a player transfer internationally in these circumstances later in his career, it is important to bear this in mind.

‘Wallsend is a registered charity so most of our income is still from donations, but I hope more junior clubs can benefit from similar situations in future.’
