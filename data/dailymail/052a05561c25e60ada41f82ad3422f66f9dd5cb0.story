A Labour council is using the sound of a baby choking to death in a house fire to campaign against government cuts.

Lambeth Council has also mocked up a newspaper frontpage reporting the entirely fictitious death of five children in a school in a taxpayer-funded campaign against changes to local fire services.

The extraordinary marketing campaign, which includes a video of a baby choked by smoke, has been condemned as ‘beyond tasteless’ and ‘downright sick’.

Baby: Labour-run Lambeth council has produced a video which portrays a child's bedroom filling with smoke

Row: As the clock ticks the coughing suddenly stops and the toy falls on the floor, as the council warns cuts to the fire service will endanger public safety

The sickening propaganda has been produced by the council in south London to oppose plans by the capital’s mayor Boris Johnson to shut Clapham fire station.

A YouTube video features a collection of children’s toys on a bookcase as the room gradually fills with smoke.

In the background a young child can be heard coughing, with the choking sound getting worse as the smoke appears to thicken.

A caption reads: ‘The Mayor of London wants to close Clapham Fire Station. This will add 34 seconds to the average response time for firefighters to reach emergencies in Lambeth.’

A timer starts counting in the corner and when it reaches 13 seconds a toy rabbit falls off the bookcase and the child’s coughing suddenly stops.

The council has also produced a shocking mock newspaper front page with the headline: ‘Five children dead in school fire.’

It also refers to 'tragedy in Clapham' and quotes: ‘"Every minute counts” says distraught headteacher’.

Other fictional newspapers report 'Blaze at old folks home kills 3' and 'Fire wrecks Clapham businesses. 

Pressure: London Mayor Boris Johnson has been targeted in the campaign against cuts to the London Fire Service

The 'story' reports that the 'community is in mourning for five children who lost their lives to smoke inhalation after becoming trapped in a horrific fire at a school'.

But none of this happened, and is part of what the council calls 'the headlines we don’t want to see'.

The poster was used at a public meeting on Monday where up to 90 people were urged to contact a consultation against the closure.

The Conservatives today condemned the scare tactics in the strongest possible terms.

Bob
Neill, Tory party vice-chairman, said: ‘Lambeth council have a bad 
track record for using council taxpayers money to promote political 
scare stories, but this is plumbing new depths.

Tasteless: This dramatic - but fictional - newspaper front page has been produced by Lambeth council

‘To conjure up the idea of the death of children in this way is beyond scaremongering and beyond tasteless. It is downright sick.’

But Lambeth council was unrepentant, insisting the cuts posed a ‘very real danger to the public’

The London Fire Authority, which is headed by the London Mayor, wants to close 12 fire stations across the capital.

James Cleverly, chairman of the authority said: 'I completely understand people are concerned,but the Council’s attempts to generate fear amongst its residents are disgusting.

'These posters are an ill-judged and irresponsible addition to a Lambeth campaign already marred by emotive misinformation.

'LFEPA and the Mayor will listen closely to the views of residents before any final decisions are made.'

Lambeth council says more than 5,500 residents have signed an online petition against the plan to close Clapham Fire station, which serves an area where 16,000 new homes are planned.

Councillor Lib Peck, leader of Lambeth council, said: ‘On Monday night at a packed meeting in Clapham, a firefighter said increased response times will cost lives.

‘No other area of London will suffer more than Lambeth from these proposals which will see the time it takes for a fire engine to reach an emergency rise by four minutes in Clapham, compared to an extra 16 seconds across London.

'The posters and film reflect the very real danger to the public of closing Clapham fire station. We believe it's important that our residents are aware of the proposal to close Clapham fire station and the dangers to public safety as a result of increased response times.’

In April it emerged Lambeth council spent hundreds of pounds of taxpayers’ money on 50 posters and an online advert opposing Coalition cuts in welfare.

The advert, displayed on Lambeth’s website, featured a giant pair of scissors slicing through a pound sign.

It read: ‘The government are making cuts to benefits. If you claim benefits, it is likely you will receive less and may have to find work or move to a different property.’

It then encouraged claimants to contact the town hall’s benefits support team who ‘can help make sure you are getting all you are allowed to claim’.

The Tories reported the council to the local government ombudsman for the abuse of taxpayers’ money.
