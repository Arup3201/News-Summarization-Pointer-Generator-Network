Li Hua organised a funeral and buried the ashes before learning the body was not that of her husband (file photo)

A wife who spent five days mourning the death of her husband in a road crash is to sue the police officers who gave her his body - after they confessed he had survived the accident.

Li Hua, from Nanbu, Sichuan province, southern China, had already staged a full family funeral and buried the ashes from the cremation when police admitted they had mixed up the details of one of the survivors and one of the victims.

Mrs Li found out her husband was still alive on Wednesday.

The injuries to the man's face were so severe the woman did not realise the body released to her was not that of her husband, Wang Daneng.

Her heavily bandaged husband had been cared for in hospital by the family of Zhang Deyong, who was in fact killed in the accident.

When he regained consciousness and began to speak, the family realised it was not Zhang Deyong underneath the bandages, but Wang Daneng.

The pair's details had been mixed up by police officers in the aftermath of the fatal truck crash last week.

Li Hua said: 'When a policeman tells you "this is your husband", you believe him.

'It was a terrible thing to do and they must pay for that.

'We only found out the truth when my husband regained consciousness in hospital and started to speak, then the family realised they didn't know him at all,' she said.

Police have admitted the mistake but a spokesman said: 'It was a serious accident with several dead and several injured.

'We regret the mix-up but Mrs Li was shown the body before she took it away.'
