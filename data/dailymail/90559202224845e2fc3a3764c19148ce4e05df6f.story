A mother who tried to censor television nudity with a towel has become a meme.

Reddit user DantesInfernape shared the hilarious image of his mother on Sunday, with the caption: 'There were boobs on-screen, so my mother took action. I am a 22 year old gay man.'

He explained that he and his modest mom were watching Paul Thomas Anderson's 2012 film The Master, when she got up to shield him from an R-rated visual.

'She never shook the uncomfortability of seeing nudity with her children,' he added.

In fact, his mother has a history of trying to protect him from unsavory movie scenes.

'My mom covered my eyes during the Natalie Portman strip scene in Closer in theaters when I was in 7th grade. Granted, that probably wasn't a movie that a 13-year-old should be watching,' he wrote. 

Other Reddit users were quite entertained by the overprotective mother and quickly began Photoshopping her onto other images.
