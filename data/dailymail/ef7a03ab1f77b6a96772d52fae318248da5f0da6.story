A 'pastor' who took up to $1,000 from trusting parents for the promise of activity-filled holiday camps for their children allegedly concocted the bogus service.

Dejean Gathers is alleged to have duped as many as 40 unsuspecting parents who arrived at one of seven centres across New York and New Jersey to drop off their children safe in the knowledge they would be enjoying themselves in the capable hands of the pastor and his teams.

But they found no one waiting for them and nothing organised, while at the same time being out of pocket and with teary-eyed children to look after during the school holidays.

The children and their parents had been promised trips to theme parks like Six Flags, which has water rides, pictured, and entertainment

According to the New York Post, Gathers, from Atlanta, claims to be a pastor at the Prophetic Promise Cathedral Church in Atlanta. 

The Brooklyn District Attorney's Office is now investigating a flood of complaints from angry parents.

The parents said they found and paid for the service, branded as 'Camp Vision Now', via an online coupon website called Living Social.

They enroled their children to one of five camps which promised trips to theme parks, including Six Flags, which has water-parks, amusement centres and rides, and Chuck E Cheese, a pizza chain with kids games and entertainment. 

They were directed to drop off their children on the first day at a specified nearby centre, which included three churches, two schools, a hotel and a ballroom in locations in Brooklyn, The Bronx and New Jersey.

It wasn't until that moment that they discovered they had been allegedly scammed.

The summer camp also said the children would be dining at family entertainment restaurants like Chuck E Cheese

'I felt so bad because they said they paid $800 or $1,000 for their children to be here all summer and there was no camp,' said an employee at one of the bogus drop-off sites, St. Anthony’s Baptist Church in Crown Heights, quoted in the NY Post.

However, the report says Gather did staff one centre, the ballroom in Crown Heights, with three counsellors — but the city Health Department eventually issued him with a cease-and-desist order because he didn’t have any permits for the disorganised gathering.

Prior to the City's intervention, somewhat confused and bewildered kids were herded into libraries or led on aimless walks around Brooklyn to kill time.

According to the NY Post, Gathers pleaded guilty in 2010 to advertising occupied apartments for rent in The Bronx and keeping deposit money from unsuspecting victims. He also pleaded guilty to larceny charges in Georgia in June 2011 and was sentenced to a year of probation.

He did not respond to repeated calls for comment.
