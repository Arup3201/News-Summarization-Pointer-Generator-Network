The son-in-law of a Monaco heiress shot dead as she left a hospital had run up debts of €9 million in advance of her murder. 

Wojciech Janowski has been accused of paying two hitmen to murder his mother-in-law Helene Pastor as she left a hospital in Nice in May. 

Mrs Pastor's chauffeur Mohamed Darwich was also killed in the attack.  

Wojciech Janowski, 64, (left) had debts of €9 million including an overdraft of €1 million according to investigators probing his mother-in-law Helen Pastor's death. The billionaire, right, was murdered in May 

Mr Janowski initially admitted his role in the killing, although he later retracted the confession, claiming that he did not understand 'all the nuances' of the French language.  

French newspaper Le Parisien said investigators had discovered Mr Janowski owed €9 million including an overdraft of €1 million. 

The newspaper also claimed that Mr Janowski faced the prospect of handing over a further €30 million after an oil deal. 

Mr Janowski has lived with Mrs Pastor's daughter Sylvia for the past 28 years. 

At an earlier court hearing, Erick Campana said that he had 'retracted his statements made while in custody' and 'denies having ordered' the killing.

Mr Campana said Mr Janowski, whohas served as Poland's honorary consul in Monaco, had 'misunderstood the meanings of the terms used by police and was speaking in French while he does not understand all the nuances of our language'.

Mr Campana said he would demand that an appeal court nullify Mr Janowski's detention - and the statements made while in custody - because he did not have access to a lawyer or interpreter during his 96 hours in custody.

However, the judge ruled that Cambridge graduate Mr Janowski must remain in custody pending trial.

Mr Janowski was arrested early last week by police on suspicion of 'masterminding' the killing of Mrs Pastor, who was shot multiple times with a sawn-off shotgun as she was leaving a hospital in the French Riviera city of Nice.

Her driver, Mohammed Darwich, 64, also died from injuries sustained in attack on May 6.

Mr Janowski was charged after prosecutors said he confessed to the contract killing, for which he allegedly spent some 250,000 euros (£198,000) to hire two alleged contract killers.

The two men - a 31-year-old and a 24-year-old originally from the Comoros islands and living in Marseille's rough northern districts - were also apprehended last week and charged.

Mr Janowski's personal trainer was also charged with allegedly organising the murder and acting as a go-between with the killers.

Prosecutors had alleged Mr Janowski ordered the killing 'to lay his hands on the inheritance' due to Sylvia, Pastor's eldest daughter on her death.

Sylvia was initially detained in the case but later released without charge. The two have been in a relationship for 28 years and have a teenage daughter.

Helene Pastor had inherited a huge real estate and construction business set up by her Italian grandfather Jean-Baptiste Pastor, a stone mason who moved to Monaco in 1880.

As the sleepy principality on the French Riviera slowly grew into a playground for the world's rich and famous, the family's fortune skyrocketed.

The real jackpot came in 1966 when Prince Rainier, whose fairytale wedding to Hollywood actress Grace Kelly helped catapult Monaco to international fame, gave permission to Helene Pastor's father Gildo to build high-rise buildings along the seafront.

Mr Janowski heads a Monaco nanotechnology firm and an oil business, and is involved in numerous charities in the principality.

After he was charged, Poland announced it was stripping Mr Janowski of his title of honorary consul 'because of the loss of the irreproachable reputation that is essential for this role'.

It also noted that as an honorary official Mr Janowski did not enjoy diplomatic immunity from criminal prosecution.
