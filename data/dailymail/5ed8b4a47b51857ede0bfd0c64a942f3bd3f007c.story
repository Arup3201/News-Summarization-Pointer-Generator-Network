Pop star Lady Gaga visited WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange  in the Ecuadorean embassy as nine people who acted as his bail sureties were ordered to hand over a total of £93,500.

The singer emerged just after midnight yesterday after spending five hours in Assange's refuge in west London. She had arrived at 7pm and it's believed she had dinner with the 41-year-old.

Assange has been staying in the embassy in Knightsbridge since June after going there to avoid extradition to Sweden to face questioning over allegations of rape and sexual assault made by two women.

He fears that if he is extradited to 
Sweden, he will be sent to the U.S. to face interrogation over the 
whistle-blowing website, which has published secret military files and 
diplomatic cables.

Assange has been granted political asylum by Ecuador but faces arrest if he leaves the embassy after breaking bail conditions.

Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle has ruled Assange's nine backers have to pay the cash by November 6.

Vaughan Smith, a friend who is one of 
the sureties, addressed Westminster Magistrates’ Court last week on 
behalf of the nine, who put up £140,000 between them.

 

He said all those who offered sureties of varying amounts are ‘convinced that they have done and are doing the right thing’.

At the court yesterday, the Chief Magistrate said he accepted that they had all acted in good faith.

‘I accept that they trusted Mr Assange
 to surrender himself as required,’ he said. ‘However, they failed in 
their basic duty, to ensure his surrender. They must have understood the
 risk and the concerns of the courts.’

He ruled that each of the sureties had
 to pay part of the sum originally pledged, as follows: retired 
professor Tricia David £10,000, Lady Evans (the literary agent Caroline 
Michel) £15,000, Joseph Farrell £3,500, Sarah Harrison £3,500 and journalist Phillip Knightley £15,000.

Also having to pay money were Sarah Saunders £12,000, journalist
 Vaughan Smith £12,000, Nobel prize-winning biologist Sir John Sulston 
£15,000, and the Marchioness of Worcester (the former actress Tracy 
Ward) £7,500.

It was revealed last week that the police bill for staking out the Ecuadorian embassy has reached more than £1million.

Scotland Yard confirmed it is costing 
£11,000 every day to ensure the Australian does not flee his bolthole at
 the Ecuadorean Embassy.

The final bill will be much more as Assange continues to defy extradition to Sweden.

Officers have been watching the 
property in Knightsbridge, west London, since Assange breached his 
bail and claimed asylum in June. They have been told to arrest him if he
 puts 'one toe' outside.

Ecuadorean foreign minister Ricardo 
Pinto has warned Mr Assange he could be in the embassy for a decade if 
he is not allowed to leave Britain.

Critics have called on the Metropolitan Police to end the costly stakeout.

Last week, Foreign Secretary William 
Hague admitted there is 'no sign of any breakthrough' after meeting Mr 
Pinto at the United Nations in New York.

The comments came after the hacking 
activist accused the U.S. of persecuting WikiLeaks and torturing Bradley
 Manning, the soldier accused of leaking classified documents.

At least four Met officers guard the 
embassy, on the second floor of a block of flats behind Harrods in 
Knightsbridge, west London, around the clock.

They have set up a £250,000 mobile 
command station on the doorstep of the building and occupy positions 
outside and in surrounding properties.

Officers from every London borough, 
specialist police units and undercover squads have been brought in to 
join the open-ended stakeout.

One colleague said: 'The officers are being moved around every three or four days to stop the boredom setting in.

'There are certainly plenty of other things these officers could be doing than standing there around the clock.'

London Mayor Boris Johnson confirmed the policing bill between June 20 and September 10 was £905,000.

If the costs continued at the average of £11,000 a day the total would now be over £1.1million.

Critics called on the Met to end the stand-off but sources said the force cannot step back from its responsibilities to arrest Mr Assange for breaching his bail.

Jenny Jones, a Green politician in the capital who sits on a committee that oversees the Met’s work, called for the officers to go back on the beat.

She said: ‘It is ridiculous at a time when the Met is stretched as never before that so many officers are waiting around the Ecuadorean Embassy for Assange to attempt an escape.’

Lib Dem Caroline Pidgeon, who also sits on the London Assembly, added: ‘For 100 days Assange has been evading an arrest warrant for the alleged offence of rape and trying to escape the fair judicial process of Sweden.

‘At a time when police counters are closing across London his actions are a gross waste of valuable resources.’
