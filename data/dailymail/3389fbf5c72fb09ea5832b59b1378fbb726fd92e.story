His reputation in the divorce courts had for decades sent a shiver down the spines of millionaires trying to shed their trophy wives.

But it appears that Raymond Tooth, known as ‘Jaws’ because of his reputation as the most formidable divorce lawyer in Britain, may have met his match.

Ayesha Vardag, nicknamed the 'diva of divorce', has taken on her former mentor, who has accused her of trying to pinch his high-profile clients.

Her firm ensured that when people searched for Sears Tooth on Google an advert for Vardags would appear under their logo.

It said: 'Vardags is a world-renowned, top family law firm, dealing with many 
high-profile cases, from celebrities and foreign royals to high-net 
worth and international individuals.'

The move is said to have infuriated Mr Tooth, whose glittering list of former clients includes Jude Law’s former wife Sadie 
Frost, rock star Eric Clapton’s ex Patti Boyd and Irina Abramovich, 
former wife of billionaire Chelsea Football Club chairman Roman.

The 73-year-old claimed that 'newcomer' Ayesha Vardag was suggesting her former boss was past his best and she wanted his clients, because she worked just like him.

The advert said: 'Sharing elements of Ray Tooth's flamboyant and forceful style, Ayesha
 Vardag has been described by senior members of the profession as the 
modern successor to the family law 'crown', which Tooth wore through the
 Eighties and Nineties." Vardags, it added, 'have had a number of 
clients transfer to them from Sears Tooth'.

Legal sources have said the aggressive move has shocked the industry, and that Ms Vardag was 'biting the hand that fed her' because Tooth gave her a job and even represented her in her own divorce.

But since then she has moved on to set up her own firm with bases in London and Winchester, with her clients wives believed to include Pamela Haworth, the fifth wife of the 
Marquess of Northampton and Meshkah Tawfik, who married a Qatari Sheikh.

A high profile case she is dealing with involves a former Miss Malaysia who could receive Britain's biggest ever divorce settlement of up to £500million after splitting from her multimillionaire husband.

Pauline Chai, 66, who lives in the couple's former family home on a 1,000 acre estate in Hertfordshire, is seeking half of Khoo Kay Peng's fortune - he is one of Malaysia's wealthiest businessmen.

Ms Vardags was also involved in changing the law on prenuptial agreements in the Supreme Court acting for heiress Katrin Radmacher.

Mr Tooth is famous for negotiating multi-million-pound settlements in celebrity divorce case.

His highly confidential business dealings are conducted – often late at night for additional privacy – in the glossy London offices of his firm, Sears Tooth, on one of the most  desirable streets in Mayfair.

His own motto is: 'Don't get even, get Tooth', and this appears to have been focused on Ms Vardag.

When he heard about the advert campaign he is said to have called his own lawyers who claimed that Vardags had suggested should avoid Mr Tooth's firm and go there.

They also spoke of copyright infringement, malicious falsehood and defamation.

Ms Vardag, through her lawyers, said no clients had instructed Vardags as a result of the advert.

The Times reported that Vardags said Mr Tooth had not 'lost 
his crown' and agreed to pay £5,000 and £38,000 in costs, but would not admit it was at fault.
