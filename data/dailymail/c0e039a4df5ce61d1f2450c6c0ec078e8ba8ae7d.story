Parents Mike and Laura Canahuati received heart-wrenching news only weeks ago - that their five-month-old daughter Avery has only months to live.

Doctors diagnosed their baby girl with Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy, the most severe kind, and gave her only 18 months to live.

Rather than bemoan their tragic circumstances, the young couple decided to make a blog called Avery’s Bucket List, in which Mr Canahuati writes in his daughter’s voice and chronicles everything she’s done on her so-called bucket list.

Scroll down for video and bucket list

Bucket list: Little Avery Canahuati was diagnosed with Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy on Good Friday and given only 18 months to live

Avery's list: The child's father Mike has been keeping a lengthy list of all the things Avery wants to do before she dies - including eating junk food, left, and wearing a big bow, right

Happier days: Avery was born on November 11, 2011, one of many 11-11-11 babies; she's pictured with proud parents Laura and Mike

The blog, written in Avery’s voice, contains milestones that most every American child will pass in the time they’re growing up – including meeting Santa, 

Avery’s blog has become something of an internet sensation – the website alone has garnered more than half a million page views, and her Facebook page has more than 12,000 ‘likes.’

Avery ‘wrote’ on her blog: ‘I have a lot of living to do in just a little bit of time and I’m going to need all of the help I can get from my parents and anyone else who wants to help.

‘Keep in mind in everything I do, the two most important things are that I’m spending time with my mommy & daddy, while at the same time spreading awareness for SMA.’

Four-legged friend: Some of the readers of Avery's Bucket List suggested the smiling girl play with a newborn puppy

Nearly there: One of Avery's things to do includes meeting Santa. With this outfit, she's on the right track

Fun with mom: Another reader suggested sliding down a slide; in another, Avery is pictured with a plush giraffe stuffed toy

The initial bucket list includes several childhood milestones, such as going swimming, going on a road trip, sit on daddy’s shoulders, have a birthday party, and stay up past my bedtime watching TV with mommy and daddy.

One of goals on the list was a little more salacious: Get a tattoo.

The cheery blog has struck a chord with parents across the world. Mrs Canahuati told Good Morning America that’s when the couple knew they had a powerful platform on which to speak.

The mother said: ‘When we saw how many people it was reaching in a few days, that’s when we realised we could really get the word out on SMA and spread the word as much as we could.’

The disease is the number one killer of U.S. children under two, she said, though the disease is largely unknown.

She urged possible parents to get tested for the genetic disease before conceiving. 

‘Our goal for Avery is to be the face of SMA,’ she said.
