Barcelona midfielder Ivan Rakitic believes team-mate Lionel Messi can continue to be the world's best player for years to come.

Messi is competing with Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo and Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer for his fifth Ballon d'Or crown in January, and the Croatia international can't see past the man that continued to break goalscoring records in the past year.

Not only does Rakitic rate Messi above all, he has set aside special praise for Xavi, too.

Rakitic: 'Messi is amazing, the best in the world and he can be the best for many years to come'

'Messi is amazing, the best in the world and he can be the best for many years to come,' Rakitic told Vecernji list. 

'I still learn from Barca players and Xavi is the best example. He has won so many trophies and still is hungry. He guides us in a way which makes us all respect him - no wonder the team trusts him.

'I enjoy playing football. Every day I wake up with a smile on my face saying: "Great, I am going to train and give my best." Those guys are all global stars but still ordinary people.'

Rakitic has also hailed Barcelona manager Luis Enrique for the way he gets the team ready and that his former boss at Sevilla had a similar approach. 

'Luis Enrique is similar to Unai Emery in the way he prepares the game and training,' he continued. 

'He is also very clear in what he asks us to do, he explains every detail so you fully understand all his requests.

'Sevilla will always be my city and some day I would like to return to southern Spain. I am very proud Sevilla appointed me as captain, my wife and her entire family have always been Sevilla fans and when I became captain I was very happy, it was the biggest honour I've ever had.'
