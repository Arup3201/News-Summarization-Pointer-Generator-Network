Accused: Catherine Kieu is alleged to have cut off her husband's penis and then dialled the emergency services

A woman who faces life in prison for allegedly drugging her husband before cutting off his penis with a kitchen knife and grinding it up in a garbage disposal has been given a $1million bail.

Catherine Kieu, 48, is said to have made her 60-year-old husband dinner at their California home earlier this month and put a poison or drug in the food to make him pass out.

When he woke up, he was tied to a bed and could not move while his wife took a 10 inch knife to his genitalia before throwing the organ into the garbage disposal and turning it on, police said.

The couple, who married in late 2009, were involved in divorce proceedings and the horrific attack followed an argument over the husband having a male friend around friend to stay at the house, according to prosecutors.

In court on Friday, Orange County Superior Court Judge Debra Carrillo set bail at $1 million.

Kieu appeared briefly in a blue jail jumpsuit, with chains 
rattling as she walked. Her long dark hair blocked portions of her face,
and she answered Carrillo's questions through a Vietnamese-language 
interpreter.

She is charged with torture and aggravated mayhem, with sentencing enhancements for great bodily injury and use of a knife. If convicted of all counts, she could face life in prison without parole.

Frank Bittar, Kieu's attorney, declined to comment on the allegations, except to say 'there's a lot there, to the case - more than meets the eye.'

Authorities were called to the 
couple's home in Garden Grove, just south of Los Angeles, after Kieu 
called 911 reporting a medical emergency.

Kieu, who works as a real estate 
broker, told officers who found her husband tied to the 
bed and bleeding from the groin that he 'deserved it'.

She had blood spattered on her legs and shirt when authorities arrived, according to court documents.

The man was rushed to the University of 
California-Irvine Medical Center in Orange where he underwent emergency 
surgery. The severed organ could not be reattached.

The husband told police she served 
him a tofu dinner which tasted 'metallic' and he went to bed at about 9pm feeling tired.

While 
he was sleeping, Kieu 'tied the victim’s legs and arms to the four 
corners of the bed with nylon ropes', prosecutors said.

The victim told authorities that when
he woke up, Kieu pulled his pants 'grabbing the victim’s penis and 
severing it with a knife'.

Kieu then took the penis to the kitchen and 
threw it in the garbage disposal, 'turning it on, and mutilating the 
organ'.

In 1993, Lorena Bobbitt cut off her husband's penis in Virginia and 
threw it out of her car window into a field on the side of the road.

She
claimed years of sexual abuse drove her to the attack, and she was 
acquitted by reason of insanity. The penis was later reattached.
