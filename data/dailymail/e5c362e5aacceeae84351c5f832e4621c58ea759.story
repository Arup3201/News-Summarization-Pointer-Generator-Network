A garage manager trying to stop petrol thieves has been dragged 200 yards down a road and thrown from the vehicle.

Lekshmanan Asokkumar, 58, is fighting for life after trying to write down the registration number of the dark-coloured car at the Texaco in West Kingsdown, Kent.

He is in a critical condition and his son has spoken about how customers described seeing Mr Asokkumar clinging onto the vehicle's windscreen wipers before losing his grip and falling to the road.

Injured: Lekshmanan Asokkumar, 58, pictured with his wife Judie, was in a critical condition after he tried to stop petrol thieves at a garage in Kent

Crime scene: Lekshmanan Asokkumar, owner of this garage in West Kingsdown, Kent, was seriously hurt in a hit and run on the forecourt yesterday

Callous: The 58-year-old father of two was thrown from the car 200 yards down the road and left for dead

His son Arun Geetha Asokkumar, 27, said: 'I was told he hung on to the wipers for about 200 yards before falling off on to the side of the road.

'The car didn't stop, the driver just left my dad for dead. All he did was go outside to take down the car's registration number when he saw they hadn't paid.

'He was standing about three or four feet in front of the car when the driver suddenly took off, hitting my dad.'

'He was thrown on to the car’s bonnet and tried to cling on to the wipers to stop himself falling off.

'The driver was a man and there was a woman in the front passenger seat. They were driving a black hatchback.'

The father-of-two was airlifted to 
King's Hospital in London from the Texaco garage in West Kingsdown, 
Kent, following the incident yesterday afternoon.

Mr Asokkumar's son added: 'I wasn’t there when it happened, but the cashier went running down the road to see my dad.

'He said he was responsive, but had bad head injuries. He had already been taken to hospital by the time I got there. We’re all just in shock and really worried. I can’t believe this has happened.'

Investigation: Police officers and crash investigators examine the scene for clues as they attempt to track down the driver of the car

Cordoned off: The injured man ran onto the forecourt in an attempt to write down the driver's registration number as the car drove off having not paid for fuel

Mr Asokkumar’s wife Judie, 61, added: 'He is very protective about his money and I have told him before not to run after people that don’t pay.'

Kent Police sent the force helicopter up to look for the driver and detectives are now looking at CCTV from the garage.

Police have described the car as a dark-coloured small saloon vehicle and it is believed that a man and woman were inside.

A Kent Police spokesman said last night:  'Officers have not yet been able to speak to the injured man but it is believed that he was working at the Texaco service station and was trying to prevent the car from leaving after it was filled with fuel at about 2.15pm.

'The car, which did not stop, is described as a dark-coloured small, saloon vehicle and it is believed a man and a woman were inside. It is not known whether the car was damaged in any way.'
