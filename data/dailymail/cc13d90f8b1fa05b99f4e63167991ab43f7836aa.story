Action needed: Lord Justice Munby, the top family judge. says that contraception should be forced on problem parents

Problem parents with up to 15 children should be encouraged to use contraception by the courts, one of England’s most senior judges said last night.

Sir James Munby, President of the Family Division of the High Court, said it is a ‘distressingly regular occurrence’ that mothers end up with their dozen or more children taken into care.

He praised the concept of Family Drug and Alcohol Courts, which are being set up in several areas to control the problem.

These courts can give parents with huge families contraception to prevent ‘repetitive pregnancies’.

The judge, who is the most senior family judge in England and Wales, made his comments at the annual meeting of the British Association of Social Workers.

‘The new FDAC projects have dealt with the taking into care of  14 children of one mother and  colleagues have dealt with a case of 15,’ he said.

‘I have certainly dealt with a case of 11 children. These cases are still happening. Eleven children being taken into care, or 14 children – these are very usual.

‘Repetitive pregnancies and repetitive care proceedings are a distressingly regular occurrence.’

The court proceedings involve social services, drug and alcohol experts and doctors, who draw up plans for parents. They also meet judges one-to-one rather than in the courts. It is hoped that this approach will keep children out of care and the parents out of prison, or off drink and drugs.

‘With some local authorities contraception is an important part of the thinking,’ Sir James said. ‘The whole thing is very intensive but it does seem to work. The savings if you can avoid care proceedings are enormous.’

Dropping the traditional adversarial approach used in British courtrooms in favour of a Continental-style inquisitorial approach had helped the new courts be  successful, he added.

‘That was a difficult concept for 
lawyers to accept,’ he said. ‘They were worried about what their  
clients might say. But it has been an absolutely key component in 
getting FDAC to work. The judge is able to built up a personal rapport 
with the mother and father. And from the parents’ point of view, it 
makes them feel part of the process rather than being a spectator.’

In
 a wide-ranging speech, he pointed out there was a ‘tension’ between 
government guidelines in adoption and a recent key ruling from the 
Supreme Court.

He said: 
‘Ministerial guidance came out, in spring last year, which contained at 
some point the statement or an exaltation that social workers should get
 away from the idea that adoption is a last resort.

Backing: Sir James, one of the most senior judges at the High Court, says that avoiding care proceedings will save a fortune

‘Two months later a ruling from the Supreme Court said adoption should in fact only be used as a last resort. They are very difficult to reconcile – that is judicial speak for irreconcilable. In the final analysis, if there is a clash between what the Supreme Court says and the  guidance says, then under our constitutional system the Supreme Court wins.’

If politicians wanted to shift the balance in favour of the Government guidelines, making adoption more frequently used, they should change the law, he added.

He added that the courts must also devise a system which allows children taken into care to find out the reasons for the decision in later life, if they wish, saying: ‘We don’t deal with this adequately’.

Sir James has said previously that a controversial court which can make life-or-death decisions and send people to jail in secret, should be opened up to public scrutiny.

Addressing a conference in  London last autumn, he indicated that the rules for the Court of  Protection should be changed to make it more transparent.

Sir James said it should be treated in the same way as the family courts where media are allowed to attend.

He is also keen to further open up the family courts – which journalists can now attend but are more often than not prevented from reporting the details of a case.

He said that while there were differences between the family court and the Court of Protection, they should be part of a single system. More judgments should be published, so the public could have confidence justice was being done.
