Iain Duncan Smith has waded into the tax row engulfing Ed Miliband by saying the Labour leader ‘seems to have managed to have avoided tax’.

The Work and Pensions Secretary stood by his comments last night despite a furious response from Mr Miliband’s office.

A Labour spokesman said that unless Mr Duncan Smith retracted his comment he would face being known ‘for his dishonesty as well as his incompetence’. But a source close to the minister said he had no intention of apologising.

The intervention comes a week after Mr Miliband was accused of benefiting from a controversial tax avoidance scheme. The Labour leader and his family used a ‘deed of variation’ to divide up ownership of the family home in North London. The deed – which changes the terms of someone’s will – is used almost exclusively to reduce death duty bills in a legal form of tax avoidance.

Mr Miliband – who has spent the past fortnight attacking corporate tax dodgers – denies the charges, saying he has never made any money from the arrangement.

Mr Duncan Smith made his comments during an interview with BBC News. He said: ‘Labour are completely at odds with each other and can’t seem to get their lines right, whether it’s on the Health Service or whether it’s on people who pay tax, let alone the man who runs the Labour Party, who seems to have managed to have avoided tax as well.’

Mr Miliband’s spokesman called on the Work and Pensions Secretary to retract his comment.

‘Iain Duncan Smith brings politics into disrepute by repeating what is a straightforward lie,’ the spokesman said. ‘Ed Miliband has made sure all taxes due have been paid.

‘The people admitting to avoiding tax are Tory donors and the people refusing to act to tackle tax avoidance are Iain Duncan Smith, George Osborne and David Cameron. 

Mr Duncan Smith should retract and apologise today. If he does not, he will be known for his dishonesty as well as his incompetence.’

Last week, Mr Miliband vociferously denied any claims that the deed of variation could have saved him and his brother David thousands of pounds. Both deny any wrongdoing and say they have paid all the tax owed.

The Labour leader said: ‘The deed of variation is something that my mother did 20 years ago. That was just a decision she made. I paid tax as a result of that transaction, I’ve avoided no tax in that. No doubt the Conservative Party wants to smear mud but frankly it’s not going to work.’

The row erupted with Mr Miliband facing another headache with the re-emergence of a former Labour candidate who was embroiled in a vote-rigging scandal.

Karie Murphy was suspended from Labour along with a Unite official amid accusations that the union signed up local people to the party to ensure her selection as the candidate for the Falkirk seat. They were both reported to police before being reinstated in the party after being cleared of wrongdoing in subsequent inquiries.

Miss Murphy, who is a close friend of Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, is now understood to be in the running for the marginal Halifax seat. 

The union has donated more than £10million to the party under the leadership of Mr Miliband, who has consistently refused to publish Labour’s secret report into the Falkirk affair.

Top Tories swapped emails discussing how to smear Labour MPs with paedophile allegations, it was claimed yesterday.

A series of the messages between staff at Conservative Campaign Headquarters were allegedly sent to a national newspaper journalist by accident.

Labour MP Tom Watson made the extraordinary claim in an online blog. He said he was told that the journalist was mistakenly copied in on emails in which Tory officials speculated about which Labour MPs were paedophiles.

The MP claimed the alleged messages meant that senior Conservative officers were either withholding ‘vital intelligence’ from the police or engaging in a ‘smear campaign’ against their opponents.

Mr Watson, former Labour Party deputy chairman and general election co-ordinator, wrote to David Cameron about the alleged emails last month.

Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps replied to Mr Watson saying he had looked into the claims and found no evidence to back them up.

Separately, a senior executive at the newspaper told Mr Watson the emails in fact related to well-established links between senior Labour politicians and notorious campaign group, the Paedophile Information Exchange.

A Tory Party spokesman said last night that Mr Watson’s allegations were ‘completely false and without foundation’.
