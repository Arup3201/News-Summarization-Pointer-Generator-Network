A group of young men in Saudi Arabia have been arrested for 'playing loud music and dancing inappropriately' at a private party. 

The men were celebrating one of the group's birthdays when police stormed the apartment they were in in the city of Buraydah in Qassim province. 

Officers of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, commonly referred to as the morality police, were acting on a tip off, local media reported.

A group of men were arrested in the city of Buraydah in Saudi Arabia (above) after a resident phoned police to report their loud music and 'inappropriate dancing'

Buraydah is home to some of the kingdom's most conservative clerics with many residents observing Wahhabism, a strict interpretation of Islam. 

An unnamed official told the news website Ayn al-Youm the men were found 'in a compromising situation' by police. 

There was cake and candles at the apartment, he added, but there were no signs the men had been drinking or cavorting with women which are both against the law. 

None of the men were dressed traditionally, he said, before urging parents in the area to prevent their children from engaging in such behaviour 'because it can lead to immorality and even homosexuality'. 

Critics took to Twitter to condemn the raid, pointing out that the men had not committed any crimes. 

Others ridiculed their arrests by sharing photographs of royals performing the traditional Saudi sword dance which is widely accepted as being masculine. 

The Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice is tasked with enforcing Islamic law in the region and is known to take action against residents they consider to be inappropriately dressed. 

In 2008 the force arrested an American businesswoman for having a coffee with a male colleague in a Starbucks in Riyadh. 

King Abdullah (left), who died last month, had appointed a reformist police chief. Upon ascending to the throne however, King Salman (right) gave the position to a different cleric

The 37-year-old mother-of-three said she was strip searched and forced to sign a false confession after the incident which, she said, left her fearing for her life. 

Police issued a statement defending her arrest, condemning her behaviour as against Sharia law. 

In October 28 people were arrested after attending a 'depraved' party near Madinah. 

Officers seized alcohol and musical instruments in the raid which came after 30 people were arrested on suspicion of Satanism and debauchery the previous year. 

Former police chief Sheikh Abdullatif al-Sheikh was considered as trying to reform the force's practices under the then reigning monarch, King Abdullah Bin Abdul Aziz. 

Following his death last month, the newly crowned King Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud relieved Sheikh Abdullatif al-Sheikh from the position and appointed Sheikh Abdulrahman al-Sanad as the new agency executive. 

Critics ridiculed the raid on Twitter, sharing photographs of royals performing a traditional sword dance which is considered masculine. Above, the Prince of Wales takes part in the dance during a tour of Saudi Arabia earlier this year
