Eidur Gudjohnsen is back on familiar ground with Bolton Wanderers, taking part in a first team training session with his former side on Monday.

The Icelandic striker signed for Chelsea from the Lancashire side 14 years ago after playing at the Reebok Stadium between 1998 and 2000.

Gudjohnsen, who was contracted to Belgian side Club Brugge last season but is now a free agent, is training with the Championship side to maintain fitness.

There is no indication the striker could be joining Neil Lennon's side, with the club currently on a mini-revival in 21st place having won four of their last six games.

The 36-year-old scored 26 goals in his two seasons at Bolton, before six fruitful years at Stamford Bridge.

He then went to Barcelona, winning the Champions League in 2009, before going on a journey via Monaco, Tottenham, Stoke, Fulham, AEK Athens and Cercle Brugge.
