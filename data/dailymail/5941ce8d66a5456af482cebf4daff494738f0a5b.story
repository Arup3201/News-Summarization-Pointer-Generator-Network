USA are on the verge of qualifying for the last-16 of the World Cup after a dramatic draw 2-2 with Portugal on Sunday.

Jurgen Klinsmann's side had led the game until injury time before a last-gasp equaliser from Silvestre Varela delayed their passage into the second round.

Either way it has been a superb tournament so far for the Americans, who also beat Ghana 2-1 in their opening game, now Sportsmail takes a look at the men who have taken them this far in Brazil.

Soccer stars: USA are on the verge of qualification to the last-16 of the World Cup

Tim Howard – Everton

Born: New Jersey, March 6, 1979 (35)

Clubs: North Jersey Imperials, Metrostars, Manchester United, Everton

Education: Raised in North Brunswick, one of the USA’s most successful exports in fact spent his formative years as a midfield player, balancing his talent for soccer with his obsession with basketball.

Howard, affectionately known as Timmy by those who know him, was a teenage sensation on the court. His basketball coach Eddie Breheney recently told CBS: ‘Timmy’s athletic ability as a high school student was really off the charts. His agility, his hand-eye coordination, his stamina and just his love and passion for the game.’

By the age of 15, though, Howard was in goal for the USA youth teams and emerged as the nation’s most exciting young player, wining the MLS goalkeeper of the year award in 2001 and then earning a move to Manchester United in 2003.

Value: £3million

Born: Massachusetts, 07/11/1985 (28)

Clubs: Rhode Island Stingrays, Houston Dynamo, Stoke City

Education: After emerging into the MLS draft from the University of Rhode Island, Cameron was plucked out by Houston Dynamo.

The versatile Stoke defender, a hero for many young soccer fans in the States, recently reflected on the rise of the game in an interview with the Providence Journal: ‘In Europe, in South America, in Africa — just about everywhere else in the world — most kids grow up playing soccer,’ he said.

‘But there are so many other sports in America. There’s the NFL, the NBA, MLB, the NHL, and they’re all full of great athletes.’

He appeared for the Germans in the u-19 UEFA European Championship in 2009 and represented the country at every youth level up to the under-21 age bracket. Could the Germans come to rue his decision when the two nations face off in the final group game this week?

Besler’s first cousin Maureen Hillis admitted to a local newspaper that the family were still getting to grips with Matt’s World Cup fame: ‘It’s been a lot of fun to be a part of this. To be honest, none of us really know soccer. We were all American football.

'Topeka has some soccer, but let’s face it, it’s not a big soccer town. To even be a part of something that is so big everywhere else is cool.'

Doug Allison, the Furman coach, recently spoke to Greenville Online about how he tempted a teenage Dempsey: ‘His passion is bass fishing. That’s how I recruited him. I was like, “Well, Furman has got a lake, and there are a lot of lakes around Greenville. You can fish at Furman’s lake any day you want” – which was completely untrue (fishing wasn’t allowed). But now they may put a little Clint Dempsey spot out there by the lake.’
