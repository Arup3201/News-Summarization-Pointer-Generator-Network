If you've ever dreamed of getting away from it all with your own slice of paradise for idyllic holidays, then look no further. 

Tiny Dun Maraig - located just near the Isle of Skye - has a setting as beautiful as it is private and it has just gone on sale with a starting price of £10,000.

But you'll need to be happy to rough it as there are no modern amenities of any kind and it is barely the size of half a football pitch.

A rocky, grass-covered tidal island near the north-west tip of Scotland's Skye, close to the  quaint village Uig, it may also be the best chance for many of us to own our own private island.

Listing agent Vladi Private Islands' senior vice president Pedro Arez confirmed Dun Maraig could sell for as little as £10,000 despite describing the opportunity to own it as 'very special'.

'With this kind of island it is very hard to say what is the right price,' Arez says of the space of about 164 by 82 feet. 'To own your own island is very special.'

'The right value is the right value. Between £10,000 and £50,000 is my feeling.'

Size and proximity are two factors driving the price down, as is the fact the property has no planning permission for any form of structure beyond the remnants of a fort that can be seen only with the keenest eyes. 

Dun Mariag was once connected to the shore by a causeway and listing agent Vladi Private Islands say it's still possible to walk to from the mainland at the lowest tide. 

Local attractions include The Fairy Glen, on the other hand, is an unusual miniature landscape of grassy, cone-shaped hills and a turret shaped rock called Ewen's castle 

The island has some kitsch appear though, as 20 years ago it was given away as a prize on a German TV programme Meine Show (My Show). 

Winner Stefan Schluznus, from near Bremen, was 20 at the time and while he initially said he was keen to build a house there to 'enjoy the view' it's not known if he even even visited the island before it was put up for sale. 

On winning the island in 1994, Mr Schluznus is quoted in the Herald Scotland saying: 'I am very happy, very excited. I am jumping in the air. 

'I know you have the Loch Ness monster, whisky, bagpipes, and nice scenery but that is all I know. But all that is going to change.'

The small island has no structures or approval to add any, but boasts tranquility and stunning surrounds

He added: 'I have seen photographs of my island. I am told it is easy to get to in a small boat.

'I am much looking forward to it. Maybe I can build a small house on the island and sit and admire the view.' 

Vladi Private Islands' portfolio includes deluxe islands befitting the rich and famous in the Caribbean and the Mediterranean, but doesn't have a lot to say about Dun Maraig. 

'A rocky structure, covered by grass; attentive owners may even find the remains of a fort if they look closely enough,' their promotional material states, before going on to wax lyrical about its surrounds. 

Singers perform on the German TV show, Meine Show, which gave Dun Maraig away as a prize in 1994

'The village of Uig is located close to this island for sale, offering nice walks which take in waterfalls, woodlands and cliff-tops too,' it says. 

'The Fairy Glen, on the other hand, is an unusual miniature landscape of grassy, cone-shaped hills and a turret shaped rock called Ewen's castle. 

'Visitors that come to this region near the Isle of Skye will be spoiled by good restaurants, a lively bar, hotels, bed and breakfast accommodation, a campsite, shops, a petrol station, and much more. Furthermore the village is served by an excellent transport network, which comprises of boat trips, a ferry service to the Western Isles and a local and mainland bus service.'
