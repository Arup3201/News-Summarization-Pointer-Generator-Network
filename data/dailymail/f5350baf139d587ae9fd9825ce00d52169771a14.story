Judd Trump held his nerve to edge past Neil Robertson and book a final clash with Ronnie O’Sullivan in the Champion of Champions tournament in Coventry.

Trump got the better of a tense safety battle in the 10th frame of the match to edge home 6-4 after Robertson missed a blue which would have taken it to a decider.

Trump led the Australian 3-1 and 5-3 but will be relieved to have nudged home to face O’Sullivan, who in contrast finished with a flourish to see off Ding Junhui by the same score.

Tied at 4-4, defending champion O’Sullivan reeled off breaks of 91 and 125 respectively in the final two frames to move closer to his first tournament win of the current season.

Ding himself had won two successive frames to claw back an early O’Sullivan lead to 3-3 and responded again after the Englishman won the seventh with a break of 105.
