A woman masquerading as a pilot spent hours in the cockpit of a Qantas passenger jet during a long-haul flight, it has emerged.

The ground crew worker wore parts of a pilot's official uniform and was given access to the cockpit of an A380 Superjumbo during the flight from Dubai to Sydney.

Now a union has sent a furious letter to Qantas about the incident after a group of angry pilots complained.

Richard Woodward, vice president of the Australian and International Pilots Association, told The Age: 'It was stupid. She was sitting in the cockpit for a large percentage of the flight,' he said.

'I think it was naive and silly.'

According to the airline, the woman was wearing 'parts' of a pilot's uniform, but they were unable to explain why.

A spokesman said she was sitting in the cockpit for 'operational reasons' and that she had not tried to deceive the flight crew who were all well aware of her true identity.

'We're examining precisely why this 
happened. However, it's clear that the staff member was on the flight 
deck for operational reasons and was not in any way trying to deceive 
the flight crew, who knew the staff member wasn't a pilot,' the airline 
said in a statement.

The 
woman who is understood to work in Qantas's navigation department, had
been issued a 'red' Australian Security Identification Card, which 
allowed her entry to restricted areas, including the cockpit, provided 
she has the captain's permission.

She had worn the pilot's uniforms on both the trip from Sydney to Dubai as well as the return flight. She had been booked onto the flight and had been expected to sit with the crew.  

Mr Woodward added: 'She is purporting to be somebody she is not.

'At the company's direction, they put a person on the flight deck dressed as a pilot who is not a pilot. It is not appropriate under any circumstances. The pilots are all up in arms.'

In the event of an emergency, he said the flight attendants on the A380s would have looked to her for direction because she was dressed as a pilot.

Qantas A380s normally fly with three legitimate pilots on board.
