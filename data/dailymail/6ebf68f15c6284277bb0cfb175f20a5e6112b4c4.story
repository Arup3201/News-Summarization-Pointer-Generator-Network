Two men will appear in court after allegations of racist chanting at St Pancras station following Chelsea's Champions League clash in Paris.

Transport police issued photographs of seven men as part of their probe into the incident which is said to have taken place at around 8pm on February 18.

Witnesses claimed a group of fans marched through the station hurling racist abuse and making racist chants.

This was the day after an incident on the Paris Metro before Chelsea's match with Paris St Germain when a black man was subjected to alleged racist abuse as he unsuccessfully tried to board a carriage.

The two men identified in connection with the St Pancras allegations will appear before Westminster Magistrates in May.

A spokesman for British Transport Police (BTP) said: 'Following a thorough investigation we have reported two 21-year-old men for summons in relation to offences of racially aggravated harassment.

'The men, who are from Mitcham and Worcester Park, will appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Monday, 11 May.'

BTP say they are still investigating a separate incident in which a group of Chelsea supporters are alleged to have made racist chants on a train service from London Euston to Manchester Piccadilly following their side's Capital One Cup Final victory over Tottenham Hotspur on March 1.
