The millionaire founder and CEO of the Panera Bread chain is currently attempting to live on just $4.50 a day as part of a campaign to show what it’s like for the millions of Americans who depend on food stamps.

Ron Shaich, a keen advocate of large corporates giving back, started his low budget food shopping challenge on Saturday and has committed to doing to for an entire week.

Shaich’s effort is part of the SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) Challenge, designed to raise awareness that ‘nearly 48 million people receive food stamps and 16 million children go to bed hungry.’

Not many treats: Ron Shaich's shopping list for his week of living on $4.50 per day consists of a lot of carbs - pasta, lentils and chickpeas. He has almost $6 remaining for a sugar fix at some stage

As well as the millionaire businessman, 26 members of Congress - all democrats - are also trying to live on $4.50 per day.

Blogging about the challenge on LinkedIn, Shaich wrote about the difficulties of trying to buy healthy food on a weekly budget of $31.50. 

To make his money stretch as far as possible, he visited an NSA Supermarket in Dorchester, Mass., to pick up food in preparation for the challenge.

Shaich writes that he soon learned he was going to have to forgo meat, fruit, vegetables and his favorite granola and instead load up on filling, carb-heavy foods.

Shiach spent $25.95 on his trip to the grocery store and bought mainly pasta, lentils and chickpeas

In total, Shaich spent $25.95 - mainly on pasta, lentils and chickpeas - leaving him with just $6 for the rest of the week. He admitted there’s a good chance he’ll use his remaining amount on a sugar fix at some point during the week.

‘This isn't going to be easy. In fact, it’s going to be incredibly hard,’ he wrote last Friday.

‘I haven’t even felt the first pangs of hunger, and I’m already gaining a whole new perspective into challenges that so many people in this country face in dealing with food insecurity - from the embarrassment of having to leave items at the register to the diligence and ongoing calculation required to constantly prioritize and rank every purchase and potential purchase, big and small.’

The House of Representatives could vote this week to cut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, by 5.2 percent. That would mean up to six million Americans would be forced off of food assistance, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Shaich says his intention is not to ‘trivialize anyone else’s experience’ but merely to help spread a deeper awareness of America's growing food instability problem.

Panera Bread a $3 billion a year business with some 1,600 outlets in the U.S.

Panera Bread operates five 'Panera Cares Community Cafes' where there is no cash register and customers pay with suggested donations

His restaurant chain is a $3 billion a
year business with some 1,600 outlets in the U.S. but at five of those 
cafes customers are able to pay whatever they choose for what they eat.

The
unusual concept is part of an initiative by the company to help some of
the millions of Americans who can’t afford to eat on a regular basis.

The
five special restaurants operate under the ‘Panera Cares Café’ brand 
and instead of cash registers, donation boxes sit on the counter, with 
signs telling customers: ‘Take what you need; leave your fair share.’

When the cashiers take meal orders, they hand receipts to customers which show how much the food would normally cost, and then the customer decides how much to leave in the box or to take off their credit card.

The concept of a pay-what-you-can restaurant isn't new, but Panera is the first major corporation to do it

The first cafe opened in the St. 
Louis suburb of Clayton in May 2010 and since then four others have 
opened in Dearborn, Portland, Chicago and Boston. 

Between then, these five cafes are expected to serve more than a million people in 2013. 

The concept of a pay-what-you-can restaurant isn’t new, but Panera is the first major corporation to do it.

Shaich thinks other major companies should start to do the same.

'Home Depot has the capability of 
helping after major storms. The Gap could run thrift stores,' he told 
Quartz earlier this year. 'It’s a challenge to view your business as not
just extracting profit from society.'
