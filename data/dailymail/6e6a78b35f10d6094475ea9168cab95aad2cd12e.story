Frank Lampard and John Terry may have played their last games for Chelsea due to injury problems that have left them doubtful for Sunday's trip to Cardiff.

Lampard did not train today due to an illness while Terry is also struggling with an unspecified problem and are set to miss the Blues’ final game of the season.

The pair’s contracts expire after the clash against the Bluebirds and they are yet to agree an extension meaning they both could have made their final appearances for the club.

Struggling: Lampard is suffering from an illness and is unlikely to play against Cardiff on Sunday

‘Frank is ill and in bed, Samuel Eto’o got an injury today in training, John Terry a little thing too, yesterday,' said manager Jose Mourinho.

‘Normally, all of them are out for this game.’

Eto’o is also out of contract this summer and may have played his final game for the club.

On Lampard’s impact at Stamford Bridge, Mourinho added: ‘Has he played his last game? There’s nothing I can say.

‘On his Chelsea career, not now because he is too young, but maybe in a few years he will have a statue where Peter Osgood is.

‘He is one of the biggest players for this club.’

Doubt: Terry, who is out of contract this summer, has been struggling with an unspecified injury

Staying quiet: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has refused to confirm whether Terry and Lampard will remain at the club
