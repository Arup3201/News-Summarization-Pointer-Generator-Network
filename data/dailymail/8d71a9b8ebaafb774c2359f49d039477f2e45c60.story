A Milwaukee man accused of 'sexting' a 14-year-old Texas girl just weeks after his wife died in a car crash will stand trial.

Michael Gawlitta, 42, faces three charges of 'causing a child between the ages of 13 and 18 years of age to view or listen to sexual activity,' reports Fox.

Gawlitta lost his wife Tammy Gawlitta in a crash during a snowstorm in December of 2013 on 1-43 at Highway 100.

Following the crash, Micheal's community rallied to raise money for his family after the tragic death of his wife Tammy

At the time, Gawlitta's community attempted to support he and his four children, but weeks later detectives say that Gawlitta began inappropriate communication with a young girl.

The 14-year-old girl's mother Ginger seized a cell-phone from her daughter after she learned her daughter had been speaking to a man named Michael with a Milwaukee number for over three hours.

When the mother discovered a video of Michael engaging in a sexual act and whispering her daughter's name she brought the videos to police.

'I never want to see a man from the waist down, completely exposed, calling out my daughter’s name. My first reaction was I was disheartened. I was crying.

You know, I was upset. I just felt weak in the knees. I couldn’t sleep the whole night,' the girl’s mother told FOX6 News on Tuesday, April 8th.

Police spoke with the girl who says she first started talking to Gawlitta on her phone's messenger application.

She decided to talk to Gawlitta because his name was 'Mister Baseball' on the application and she likes baseball.

The girl says that Gawlitta knew how old the girl was and asked her if it was ok that he was 'three times older than she was.'

He also sent her videos at the girl's request but sad that she would not send him videos of herself which made him upset.

The girl claims that Gawlitta never asked to meet her.

Fox reports that each of Gawlitta's charges comes along with six years maximum in prison and $10,000 of fines each.  

TMJ reports that not only had Gawlitta lost his wife in a crash he had also lost his job.

Gawlitta's four children are temporarily in their mother's brothers home.
