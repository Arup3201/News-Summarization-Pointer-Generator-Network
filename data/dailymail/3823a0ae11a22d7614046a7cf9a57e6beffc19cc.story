British Airways check-in clerk Nadia Eweida triumphed over the airline yesterday after a six-year battle to wear her cross at work.

Her right to profess her religious belief should have trumped the airline’s powers to mould its image by imposing petty uniform rules on its staff, European judges declared.

A ‘jubilant’ Miss Eweida, who had lost at a string of hearings in Britain, said her first reaction to the ruling had been to say: ‘Thank you, Jesus.’

But her victory came as three other Christians lost claims at the European Court of Human Rights. Nurse Shirley Chaplin, who wanted to wear a cross with her uniform, was told that her bosses were right to remove her from the wards because of the importance of health and safety for NHS patients.

And two Christians who were sacked in gay rights disputes were both properly dismissed, the Strasbourg court ruled.

Lillian Ladele, a registrar with Islington council, had declined to conduct civil partnership ceremonies. Gary McFarlane, a Relate counsellor, had been reluctant to give sex advice to gay couples.

The judgment in Miss Eweida’s case is likely to open the way for Christians to declare their faith by wearing or displaying the cross at work, unless their employer can show a good reason why they should not.

Victory: Miss Eweida said she 'jumped for joy' and thanked Jesus after hearing the decision this morning

But the Government’s Equality and Human Rights Commission said employers would be confused.

It called for new laws from 
Westminster on the rights of religious believers to demonstrate and 
practise their beliefs in public.

Miss Eweida, 61, had been told by 
British Airways that she must remove the cross she wore with her 
uniform, even though the airline was happy for Sikh men to wear turbans 
and bracelets and for Muslim women to wear headscarves.

After her victory she said: ‘I’m 
overwhelmed, but jubilant. When I heard the result I literally jumped up
 and down for joy and said “thank you, Jesus”.

‘I’m very pleased Christian rights 
have been vindicated. I believe there will be a big impact and it will 
encourage employees who are too timid or reserved to wear their crosses 
not to be afraid to show their faith.’

Backing: The Prime Minister tweeted this morning he was 'delighted' about the ruling in Strasbourg

The Daily Mail revealed in 2006 that Nadia Eweida had been suspended for wearing a cross

The Egyptian-born Coptic Christian was
 sent home without pay in September 2006. Her suspension provoked a 
public outcry after it was reported by the Daily Mail.

The airline allowed her back to work 
in February 2007 under new rules allowing the cross and the Star of 
David to be displayed with uniforms.

However a series of British tribunals and the Court of Appeal said the airline had been right and she had been wrong.

Yesterday the Strasbourg judges said 
that while BA had a right to protect its corporate image, ‘Miss Eweida’s
 cross was discreet and cannot have detracted from her professional 
appearance’.

Lost: Andrea Williams of the Christian Legal Centre holds the cross of Shirley Chaplin, whose complaint about not being able to wear it at work in a hospital was not upheld

Case: Marriage counsellor Gary McFarlane, 51, who was sacked for saying he might object to offering sex therapy to homosexuals also lost today

Disappointment: Shirley Chaplin with her confirmation cross pendant which she wears on a necklace - but her discrimination case was lost today

Government lawyers opposed her claim 
and the three others in Strasbourg. British officials said the 
Government is bound to uphold the decisions of the British courts.

However yesterday David Cameron 
tweeted that he was ‘delighted that the principle of wearing religious 
symbols at work has been upheld – people shouldn’t suffer discrimination
 due to religious beliefs’.

Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu 
welcomed the ruling. ‘Christians and those of other faiths should be 
free to wear the symbols of their own religion without discrimination,’ 
he said.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, 
who has backed the right of Christians to declare their faith, said of 
Miss Eweida’s victory: ‘I’m delighted that the principle of it has been 
upheld by the European Court.

‘The Prime Minister has said we would 
change the law if it wasn’t. Our lawyers are still looking through the 
judgement but their view is it is not going to be necessary to have to 
change the law.’

The judges added: ‘There was no 
evidence that the wearing of other, previously authorised, items of 
religious clothing, such as turbans and hijabs, by other employees, had 
any negative impact on British Airways’ brand or image.

Moreover, the fact that the company 
was able to amend the uniform code to allow for the visible wearing of 
religious symbolic jewellery demonstrates that the earlier prohibition 
was not of crucial importance.’

Dr John Sentamu said tribunals and courts should not have to rule on what symbols people could or could not wear

Christians should be able to wear the symbols of their religion without being discriminated against, the Archbishop of York said today.Reacting to the judgment from the European Court of Human Rights, Dr John Sentamu also said tribunals and courts should not have to rule on what symbols people could or could not wear.But the National Secular Society (NSS) said 'true religious freedom' was for employees who feel parts of their job go against their conscience to find another role.Dr Sentamu said: 'Christians are not obliged to wear a cross but should be free to show their love for and trust in Jesus Christ in this way if they so wish.'In July 2012, the General Synod stated that it is the calling of Christians to order and govern their lives in accordance with the teaching of Holy Scripture and to manifest their faith in public life as well as in private.'This means giving expression to their beliefs in the written and spoken word, and in practical acts of service to the local community and to the nation.'The Equality Act 2010 encourages employers to embrace diversity - including people of faith. Whether people can wear a cross or pray with someone should not be something about which courts and tribunals have to rule.'
