Britain's soaring cost of living which crippled families last year has come to a halt, with the rate of inflation plunging last month, official figures revealed today.

The consumer prices index measure of inflation fell from 4.2 per cent in December to 3.6 per cent in January.

Economists predict it is likely to keep on dropping for the rest of the year. The Government’s target for CPI inflation is two per cent.

But the pain continues for workers because inflation remains far above the average pay rise that they are getting.

The latest figures have seen inflation fall to its lowest level in two years, including a 1.2 percentage point fall since November - although the rate is still 1 percentage point off the Government's target of 2%

Public sector workers who earn £21,000 or more are being hit by a two-year pay freeze while private sector workers are typically getting a rise of between two and three per cent.

Business bosses are only expecting salaries to rise slightly from last year's 0.9 per cent increases, meaning the latest inflation figures will feel 'like a pay freeze' for many employees.

Brendan Barber, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: ‘With prices still increasingtwice as fast as wages, workers are still getting poorer month-by-month while high unemployment and wage stagnation persists.’

The figures are likely to be hailed as 'proof' that the inflationary 'spike' is over, and will be welcomed by cash-strapped consumers as the cost of living begins to move in the right direction.

There was some upward pressure from 
clothing prices in the month as January's sales were less deep than in 
2011, after retailers brought their turn-of-the-year clearances forward 
to draw in customers.

Food prices were broadly flat on the month and had a slight downward impact on the overall rate of inflation.

However, a softer drop in clothing and footwear prices provided some resistance to the fall in the overall rate of inflation.

House prices rose slightly in England over 2011, boosted by London and the South, but fell year-on-year in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, official figures showed.

Across the UK, house prices recorded a small monthly increase of 0.4 per cent in December to average £205,269 the Department for Communities and Local Government (CLG) said, but analysts warned the market remains 'soft' with low consumer confidence.

Typical prices in England held steady with a modest 0.5 per cent rise over last year to £213,574, with the East, London, the South East and the South West all performing above the UK average in December.

But prices fell by 8.1 per cent over 2011 in Northern Ireland to average £133,647, by 4.6 per cent in Scotland to reach £155,595, and by 1.6 per cent in Wales to stand at £145,926.

London, which has had strong interest from overseas buyers, remains the English region with the highest average house price at £346,604, while the North East has the lowest typical price at £131,462.

Clothing
costs fell by 4.9 per cent in January, compared with a 5.9 per cent 
drop in 2011, as discounting and promotion was introduced earlier to 
tempt hard-pressed consumers in the run-up to Christmas.

Other 
measures of inflation also fell with the retail prices index (RPI) 
dropping to 3.9 per cent in January from 4.8 per cent in December, its 
lowest level in just under two years.

Financial experts welcomed the fall in inflation as a trend which could continue into the next quarter.

Professor
Michael Luger, Dean of Manchester Business School, said: 'On balance, 
the news today about further declines in the rate of inflation is 
welcomed. 

'That decline continues a trend begun last autumn and likely to continue into the next quarter, at least. 

'It
reflects the ongoing weakness of the economy which relieves pressure on
prices in general, particularly in the cost of labour.

A
Treasury spokesman said:  'Inflation fell significantly in January for 
the second month in a row, which is good news for family budgets.

The Bank of England and other forecasters expect inflation to keep falling through this year, providing additional relief.'

Despite the newly-announced decrease, Bank of England Governor Mervyn King will still have to explain to Chancellor George Osborne why the rate has yet to meet the Government's target of 2%
