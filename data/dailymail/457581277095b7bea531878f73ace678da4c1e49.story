Ricardo Vaz Te has left West Ham after having his contract terminated by mutual consent.

The 28-year-old's three-year spell with the club comes to an end after finding first team opportunities hard to come by following a number of new arrivals last summer.

The Portuguese forward has been linked with a move to Turkey and is now free to discuss a deal with other clubs as a free agent. 

Ricardo Vaz Te has only made five first team appearances for West Ham this season

Vaz Te, who moved the Upton Park in January 2012, has been limited to one substitute appearance since August and just five all season as Sam Allardyce's side have impressed in the Premier League.

The former Bolton and Barnsley striker will be best remembered by West Ham fans for scoring the winning goal in the 2012 play-off final against Blackpool that ensured the club's return to the Premier League.

'Everyone at West Ham United would like to thank Ricardo for his efforts while at the club and wish him well for his future career,' a club statement read on West Ham's website.

'It has been a pleasure to be at a club like West Ham. It was a fantastic opportunity and I am so grateful for having played here.
