Former culture secretary Maria Miller has worked to stamp out revenge porn

Posting 'revenge pornography' online could lead to a jail term of up to 14 years, under tough new guidelines published today.

The Crown Prosecution Service said uploading explicit images to spite an ex could break sex offence laws or even child protection legislation.

Putting intimate photographs or videos of an under 18 online can carry a 10 year maximum sentence in ‘very serious cases’.

But if intimate images are sent in a bid to force someone into sexual activity the sender could be hit with up to 14 years behind bars, the CPS said. 

Up to now many cases were considered under 'obscene publications laws' - which are harder to prove because they need to pass a high 'public interest threshold' and carry softer sentences.

But prosecutors have moved to toughen up sentences against the 'nasty and invasive crime' amid growing concern over people humiliating their ex partners on Facebook and other internet sites out of spite.

It came as figures revealed nine out 10 revenge porn victims  see their ex-partner escape punishment.

Just six people have been cautioned or charged for uploading explicit pictures of their ex – despite 149 victims asking the police for help.

The Crown Prosecution Service said anyone considering leaking explicit images of their ex partner should know they would be hauled before the courts. 

But the former Culture Secretary Maria Miller said the crackdown did not go far enough.

Mrs Miller said a new law was needed to ban explicit photos and videos being posted on the internet out of spite - not just 'new guidance' to tackle the problem.

She attacked the ‘existing mishmash of legislation’ which let men ridicule their former girlfriends online. 

Mrs Miller said the web could no longer be treated as the ‘wild west’ where anything goes.

She said: ‘In the last two years numerous states in the US have been forced to pass legislation, to protect private citizens from the growing problem of “revenge pornography” – where private and intimate pictures taken as part of a relationship end up online after that relationship ends, with devastating results.

‘New figures just released by police forces in England show the number of people affected by “revenge pornography” in the UK is far greater than previously thought and that the majority of these victims are not protected under the law.’

She said a new law specifically banned ‘posting sexual images online, without the consent of the person depicted’.

Mrs Miller said: ‘I would like the offence of posting this material to sit alongside voyeurism in the 2003 Sexual Offences Act to stop this emerging crime in its tracks.’

The Crown Prosecution Service today outlined new guidance designed to make it easier to punish ‘revenge pornography’ amid growing public concern over the issue.

A spokesperson for the CPS said: ‘No one should have to suffer the hurt and humiliation of “revenge pornography” – a nasty and invasive crime that appears, anecdotally at least, to have increased as social media use has gone up.

‘The Crown Prosecution Service prosecutes these cases using a range of current laws, and we have now clarified our legal guidance to set out clearly how these cases should be brought to court.

‘Due to the very personal nature of “revenge pornography” prosecutors are being asked specifically to consider the impact on the victims involved.

‘The new guidance also makes clear that the context of each case needs to be considered alongside current guidelines to ensure that the most appropriate legislation is used when prosecuting.'

The CPS said 'those intent on attacking former partners in this way' needed to see they would be hauled before the courts for their online abuse.

‘Revenge pornography’ is typically sexually explicit media that is publically shared online without the consent of the pictured individual and is usually uploaded by ex-partners.

‘The images are often accompanied by personal information including the pictured individual’s full name, links to social media profiles and address, and are shared with the intent to cause distress or harm to the individual.’
