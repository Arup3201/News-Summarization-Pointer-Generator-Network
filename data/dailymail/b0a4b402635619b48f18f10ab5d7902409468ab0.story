Walter White is using someone else’s recipe for methamphetamine.

‘Breaking Bad,’ the show about a high school chemistry teacher who cooks meth to support his family after learning he has cancer, owes University of Oklahoma chemistry professor Donna Nelson’s formula to its success.

As the show’s science advisor, Ms Nelson keeps a stern eye over the show’s drug and bomb making.Ms Nelson jumped at the opportunity to join the show because she saw it as a platform for putting accurate, interesting science in front of a young audience, she told KOCO.

Recipe for success: Donna Nelson, chemistry professor at the University of Oklahoma, is the show's science adviser

‘We scientists knew this was a problem because enrollment (in science classes) had been dropping and so I thought this is a wonderful opportunity,’ she told the station.

She also cleared the air regarding how much drugs she has cooked, for posterity’s sake, of course.‘I have to say I have never made methamphetamine,’ said Nelson.

The professor first contacted show creator Vince Gilligan after reading a profile of him in Chemical & Engineering News, she told Vulture.

Calling it an opportunity to build a bridge, she told the site she ‘knew how much the chemistry community wanted to see correct science in movies and television, and that they also wanted to see scientists presented appropriately.’

Mr Gilligan immediately took her up on the offer.

In addition to seeing that Mr White cooks great meth, Ms Nelson also makes sure the protagonist walks the walk and talks the talk. Mr White needs to also talk like a PhD, he does because of her.His lectures in class, his rants to partner Jessie Pinkman and his chats with his son, they’re authentic because Ms Nelson supervises their scripting, she told the station.

Noting a lecture Mr White gave to a class, Ms Nelson said she had to rewrite the entire thing. The memo she sent them was then made the script, they even used her diagrams.

As for Mr White’s meth? The process is real, she told Vulture, but with one caveat.

‘It’s a valid synthesis, the way they’re using methylamine,’ she said, adding that the Drug Enforcement Agency actually has a hand in overseeing the cooking.

‘What they are doing is leaving out steps. Or sometimes they show some steps from one synthesis and subsequent steps from another synthesis, which prevents Breaking Bad from becoming an illegal meth cookbook,’ she added.

Too blue: Ms Nelson says the meth is too blue to be real, but that artistic license took over so Mr White could have a trademark

She has had to allow for a bit of creative license when it comes to the show’s main product, blue meth.

Ms Nelson initially told producer Gilligan that the ‘blue was a little too blue,’ but he ‘wanted Walt to have a trademark,’ she said to Vulture.

‘So, it’s a little exaggerated. That’s OK. It’s not supposed to be 100 per cent factual.’

The meth cooking process is actually overseen by the Drug Enforcement Agency, to make sure it doesn't become 'an illegal meth cookbook'
