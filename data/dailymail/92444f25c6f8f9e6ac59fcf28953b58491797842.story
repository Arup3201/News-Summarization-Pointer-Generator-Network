One of San Francisco's most famous and smelly tourist attractions has gone under - water that is - but it seems inevitable the boisterous star-attractions will come sliding right back.

A colony of sea lions who have resided on the wooded decks of Pier 39 for more than 20 have made a sudden exit, just as they made an expected arrival in October 1989.

Shortly after the Loma Prieta earthquake hit San Francisco, the sea lions began taking up residence at the pier and forming an urban colony.

The pier was this week abandoned by the barking mammals who are thought to have gone south to breed

The decks of San Francisco's Pier 39, seen here in 2012, were once home to hundreds of sea lions

Previously, sea lions barely had enough room to stretch out on the wood pier decks during peak times

By January the following year they had taken over the area, much to the displeasure of marina tenants, and there was soon more than 300 of them lounging about and barking.

The pier soon became a tourist attraction and by November 2009, the colony reached an all-time high of 1,701.

This week the decks, once full of the blubbery sun bathers, were empty with tourists left to look out over rows of empty wooden decks.

It is thought the sea lions may have headed south to breed, as this isn't the first time the colony has disappeared on mass.

Scientists believe the sea lions went south to breed

In 2009 their numbers rose to more than 1,500, but a month later only 10 remained. At the time experts said the length of their stay, rather than their exit, was surprising.

Sea lions are migratory animals so it is in their nature to move around, San Francisco's The Marine Mammal Centre said at that time.
