There was no Ivan Lendl in his coaching box but by and large Andy Murray looked impressively businesslike as he fought his way through to the second round of the French Open.

In conditions of cold air and a blustery wind that could have been plucked straight from his native Scotland he beat world number 55 Andrey Golubev 6-1 6-4 3-6 6-3 to set up a clash with Australiaâ€™s Marinko Matosevic.

Lendl, not with him at a Grand Slam for the first time since 2011, would have been generally pleased with the way his ex-client handled himself against the flashy Kazakh, whose power off both flanks gives his opponents precious little rhythm.

Murray 
remained mainly focused, although he was disturbed at times by the 
overhead cable camera, which kept moving in his eyeline as he tried to 
serve.

His
 start was very satisfactory and full of clean hitting but one area he 
will look to improve was the way her served in a topsy turvy second set,
 which allowed Golubev to break him three times and threaten to get back
 into the match.

Overall,
 however, this was a decent start, and with his scheduled quarter final 
seed Stan Wawrinka out of the tournament there is everything to play 
for.
