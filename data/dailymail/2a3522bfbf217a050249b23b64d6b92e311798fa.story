Are you the sort of character who avoids wandering under ladders? Do you salute any magpie that crosses your path? You're not alone, as 5.8 million people admit to being superstitious.The new research, conducted by The Betway Group, revealed that over ten million people won't walk under ladders for fear that it will bring them bad luck, while a further nine million people believe that breaking a mirror will bring seven years bad fortune.

5.8 million people admit to being superstitious

And it seems people are just as 
superstitious when it comes to bringing about good luck too.

Over 800,000 people in the UK have confessed that they believe in the power of lucky underwear, while 2.7 million people admit to holding onto the 
childhood belief that if you blow out all of your birthday candles in one breath, your wish will come true.

1. Seven 2. Thirteen 3. Three 4. Eight 5. Five

When it comes to number crunching, we have our fixed ideas there too.

The number seven scored as the number the nation cited as their luckiest number, with David Beckham, who plays in a number seven shirt and even gave his daughter the middle name Seven, counted among them.

Over 4.3 million people believed having a lucky number brought them good fortune. And despite popular thinking that the number 13 is the unluckiest of all, in the survey, it came out as the second luckiest.

Richard Wiseman, Professor of the Public Understanding of Psychology at the University of Hertfordshire, said 'People can create luck and good fortune by changing their outlook on life, focusing on grabbing opportunities and creating positive expectations.'

Actress Bebe Daniels crosses her fingers for good luck as she stands underneath a ladder.

'People also create their own superstitions and rituals in the belief it will change their fortunes.''For
many people wearing a lucky football shirt, or not putting their top on
until they run onto the pitch, will change their mood provide a real 
boost in performance during the game.''It is possible through neural programming to think yourself lucky.'

1. If you walk under a ladder you will have bad luck    2. To break a mirror will bring seven years bad luck     3. To open an umbrella in the house will bring bad luck    4. Putting new shoes on the table brings bad luck    5. Friday the thirteenth is an unlucky day    6. If a black cat crosses your path you will have bad luck    7.

Avoid stepping of cracks to avoid bad luck     12. Washing a car will bring rain     13. Wearing a certain pair of pants will bring good luck
