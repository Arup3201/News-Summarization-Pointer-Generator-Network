A French bulldog-pug puppy has to wear bandages on all four legs after suffering horrific injuries which are believed to have happened during dog-fights.

Five-month-old Hero was found by a dog warden in a park in Hull, East Yorkshire, where he was hobbling around and whining in pain.

He had deep lacerations and bite marks on his legs, which are believed to have happened when he was used as dog bait - a 'sport' where smaller canines are restrained and savaged by larger ones.

The dog warden took him to an emergency vets, which found that his wounds about three days old, and he had been wandering around alone and in pain for that time in the bitter January weather.

As a result his injuries were worse and infection had set in and now has had to have all four of his legs put in bandage, which have to be changed every day.

He also has to wear a cone to stop him scratching an ulcerated eye.

Hero is being cared for by an animal trust and is due to undergo an operation after his skin was left so badly damaged its likely it will die off.

Appalling: Staff at the animal trust caring for Hero believe he may have suffered the injuries when he was used as bait in dog fights, or they could be from getting caught in thick wire

Hull Animal Welfare Trust, which believes the animal was being used as bait before it was dumped in Pearson Park, has launched its 'Help For Hero appeal' to raise the £2,000 needed for his care.

Amy Bryan, centre manager, said: 'We are not sure how he received his injuries. Either he got caught in thick wire or, what we think is more likely the case, he has been used as a bait dog.

'I'm not sure why such a dog would have been used for dog baiting. He would be quite expensive to buy, which would suggest he may well have been bred for that or stolen.

'So far we have not had anybody come forward to claim Hero, but we've had plenty of phone calls to say they will home him.

'But we can't do that yet because we have to get him back to full health first. In the meantime we need to raise money to pay for the vet's bills, which will likely be in excess of £2, 000.'

After he was taken to Kingston Vets in the city he was put on antibiotics and pain relief to help him recover, while his dressings are changed every day. 

Natasha Hillary, of Kingston Vets, where he was treated, said: 'When Hero came to us he had lacerations on all four of his legs. He also had an ulcer on his eye.

'It is quite early to tell how he will heal because one laceration is quite deep. He is walking so we expect him to do well. The hope for Hero in the future is that he will find a loving home. 

'He's gorgeous and he craves human attention. It is possible that he was somebody's pet because of his breed but nobody has reported him missing and he is not micro chipped.'

Ms Bryan added: 'Hero will have an operation at the end of this week. In cases such as this, the flesh is so badly damaged it starts to die off. This is why Hero will need his operation.'

Staff at the centre in South Cave are now looking to find the puppy a loving home after his terrifying ordeal.

She continued: 'Hero is very laid-back, even though he must be in horrific pain from his injuries. He is very gentle and I know everyone here has fallen in love with him.

'He was named Hero by the dog warden who picked him up because of how bad his injuries were.

'He will need someone that will be able to carry on his treatment, someone who has time to give him to look after him. He will need regular vet trips after everything he has gone through.'
