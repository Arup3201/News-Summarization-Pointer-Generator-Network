Samsung has topped the first ever customer satisfaction index to focus on smartphone brands. Its Galaxy S III, pictured, beat all Apple handsets

Samsung has beaten Apple to take the top spot in a customer satisfaction survey in the U.S. 

Two of its handsets - the Galaxy S III and the Galaxy Note II - tied in first and second place in the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ASCI) ahead of Apple's iPhone 5, iPhone 4S and iPhone 4.

The survey scored phones, and ultimately brands, on anticipation of quality compared to the product's actual quality, reliability, as well as price and perceived value.

Samsung's Galaxy S III and Galaxy Note II both scored 84 out of a possible 100.

Apple's iPhone 5 and 4S tied in third and fourth with 82 points, while the iPhone 4 scored 81.

Motorola Mobility's Droid Razr Maxx HD handset gave the Google-owned company sixth place with a score of 80 and its Droid Razr was in eighth with 77.

Samsung's Galaxy SII scored 78, in seventh place.

BlackBerry took ninth and tenth place with the BlackBerry Curve scoring 67 and the BlackBerry Bold on 64.

It is the first time the ACSI has compiled a list of the top smartphone brands and their handsets and is planning to release a report annually.

The survey did not cover the period since the Samsung Galaxy S4 was released, which explains its absence from the top ten.

Other ACSI reports already look at brand satisfaction and handset satisfaction individually.

ACSI's index was based on phone and email interviews with 2,500 participants.

The survey scored phones, and ultimately brands, based on anticipation of quality compared to the product's actual quality, reliability, and value for money. Samsung's Galaxy S III and Galaxy Note II, pictured, both scored 84 out of a possible 100

1. Samsung Galaxy S III - 84 out of 100

2. Samsung Galaxy Note II - 84

3. Apple iPhone 5 - 82

4. Apple iPhone 4S - 82

5. Apple iPhone 4 - 81

6. Motorola
Mobility Droid Razr Maxx HD  - 80

7. Samsung Galaxy SII - 78

8. Motorola Mobility Droid Razr - 77

9. BlackBerry Curve - 67

10. BlackBerry Bold - 64

They were asked questions about their 'anticipation' of the quality of a company's product, based 
on past experiences, the product's actual quality, its reliability, and value for money based on the perceived quality. 

These answers were used to create the overall score using a complex methodology. 

The study claims that the presence of Samsung's product at the top of list demonstrates an upward trend.

'If the [Galaxy] S IV performs as well, or even better, in the eyes of customers, Samsung could threaten Apple’s dominance in overall customer satisfaction,' said ACSI Director David VanAmburg.

VanAmburg continued that the Samsung phones scored highly for their larger screens, compared to Apple, and their price.

The most recent ACSI report for 
companies, taken in May, that looked as smartphone and feature phones 
gave Apple the top spot with 81 points, down two points from 2012.

While Samsung took second place with 76 points but had jumped seven points since 2012.

Apple's iPhone 5, right, and iPhone 4S, left, tied in third and fourth place with 82 points, while the iPhone 4 scored 81. It is the first time the ACSI has compiled a list of the top smartphone brands and their handsets and is planning to release a report annually

BlackBerry took ninth and tenth place on the index with its Curve handset scoring 67 points and the BlackBerry Bold, pictured, scoring 64

John Cox from Network World commented: 'The smartphone survey shows Samsung’s strength with U.S. consumers. Yet it’s also striking that the iPhone 4, announced in June 2010 and the iPhone 4S, announced in October 2011 are rated as highly as the 9-month-old iPhone 5 and nearly as highly as the much more recent Samsung phones.'

Samsung launched the Galaxy S III in May 2012 and the Note II five months later. 

Samsung's success may also be due to the popularity of its Android operating system.

A recent study form Kantar Worldpanel ComTech showed 
Android with a 51.5 per cent market share, while iOS had 42.5 per cent.

However, these figures may be slightly misleading because more phones run Android than iOS across the board.

The ACSI figures also contradict a recent study from Quality Insight in Korea.

The marketing firm surveyed 44,168 people about their handset and the iPhone was rated the best smartphone.

The
participants said that the iPhone rarely failed, with only 17 per cent 
complaining about technical issues with their Apple phone.

This
is compared to 31 per cent who reported issues with Samsung phones 
ranging from battery charging problems to screen quality issues.

Apple’s faults were related to touch or button errors.

According
to recent figures from uSwitch, the iPhone is still the UK’s favourite 
mobile phone.

Samsung’s
Galaxy S4 has so far failed to emulate the S3’s resounding success 
although the Samsung Galaxy range still dominates with five handsets in 
the top ten, compared to Apple’s three.

No new entries were recorded for June, despite the recent high-profile launch of the Nokia Lumia 925.
