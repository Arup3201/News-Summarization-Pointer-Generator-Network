Spared prison: Ayan Hadi, the wife of white Muslim convert Richard Dart, admitted failing to give police information about his terrorist plot

The wife of white Muslim convert Richard Dart who was jailed for terrorism offences has admitted failing to provide information that might have helped police arrest and prosecute him.

Ayan Hadi, 31, pleaded guilty to the offence at the Old Bailey today.

Her husband Richard Dart was jailed for six years in April with two co-conspirators Jahangir Alom and Imran Mahmood for planning acts of terrorism.

Hadi was also arrested and charged at the time for failing to disclose information which might have led to his prosecution.

But
 she was pregnant during her first appearance at court and her lawyer 
said any trial hearing would have to take her due date into account.

Dart's brother Robb Leech, who first
 brought the convert's views into the 
spotlight in his television documentary My Brother The Islamist, 
revealed that Hadi gave birth to a baby girl weeks before he was 
sentenced.

Writing in The Times, Mr Leech said: 'While he was in custody before the trial, Rich's new wife gave birth to a daughter, 12 weeks early.

'Now
 healthy with a life full of possibilities ahead of her, she will need a
 father and someone to guide her through the world. My only hope is that
 when Rich gets out, his little daughter will be his calling.'

Today Hadi, from Acton, west 
London, pleaded guilty to withholding information about her husband and 
will be sentenced on August 16.

Mr Justice Sweeney warned that she could also be jailed.

He told her: 'All sentencing options remain firmly open.'

Former BBC security guard Dart refused
 to stand when he was sentenced in April, saying: 'I don’t wish to stand up. I 
believe ruling and judging is only for Allah.'

The
 court heard that Dart and Alom travelled to Pakistan to try to get 
terrorist training, and took advice from Mahmood, who had already 
visited the country.

Dart, a
 son of teachers, also discussed bomb-making with Mahmood, and military 
repatriation town Wootton Bassett as a potential target.

Police
 discovered fragments of text on his laptop that revealed that the pair 
had used the computer to have a 'silent conversation' to avoid possible 
surveillance bugs - opening a Word document and taking it in turns to 
type, then deleting the text.

They
 mistakenly assumed none of it would be stored on the machine but 
forensic experts who worked through 2,000 pages of computer code 
deciphered fragments of what was said, including Mahmood making a 
reference to Wootton Bassett and then adding: 'If it comes down to it, 
it’s that or even just to deal with a few MI5 MI6 heads.'

Dart,
 who changed his name to Salahuddin al-Britani, became involved in 
extremism after moving from his home town Weymouth to east London and 
fraternising with radical preacher Anjem Choudary.

Dart was sentenced alongside Jahangir 
Alom, 26, a former Met police community support officer, and unemployed 
Imran Mahmood, 22.

Mahmood, caught bringing two rucksacks
 with traces of explosives on them back from Pakistan, was jailed for 
nine years, nine months.

Alom, who the court heard served in 
the Territorial Army in G Company of the 7th Battalion the Rifles, was 
jailed for four years, six months.

He wanted to be sent to Afghanistan so
 he could launch an inside attack, but was discharged on medical 
grounds. Police are hunting a fourth suspect thought to have fled to 
Pakistan.

The trio were captured in a huge 
surveillance operation by Scotland Yard and MI5. Investigators learned 
friends Dart and Alom teamed up with Mahmood in a bid to train with Al 
Qaeda in Pakistan, after a previous trip ended in failure.

Mahmood said he had seen a bomb-making manual.

Mr Justice Simon told the trio they 
held 'radical Islamist beliefs and have shown yourselves to be committed
 to acts of terrorism'.

Mahmood and Dart were both given 
extended sentences, meaning that they will serve two-thirds of their 
prison terms rather than half, and they will spend five years on 
licence.

The judge said that they were all 'committed fundamentalists' who would have been prepared to kill.

He told Dart and Mahmood: 'I'm 
satisfied to the required criminal standard that neither of you had 
ruled out an attack in the United Kingdom, and that you, Mahmood, were 
looking at arming yourself with a bomb.'

Counter-terrorism teams also believed that the pair used the same tactic walking down the street with a mobile phone.

Mr Justice Simon said the men held ‘radical Islamic views’, were ‘dangerous’ and could kill.

Choudary, whose groups 
Islam4UK and Muslims Against Crusades have been banned, launched an 
extraordinary defence of Dart, saying he was jailed for a ‘thought 
crime’ and had ‘committed no sin and harmed nobody’, adding ‘Jihad 
training’ is a duty for Muslim men.

The cleric appeared with Dart in a BBC
 film, My Brother The Islamist. In it, Dart said there were ‘many 
misconceptions about Al Qaeda’ and protested at a homecoming for 
soldiers.

Met Deputy Assistant Commissioner 
Stuart Osborne called the case ‘a classic example of how terrorists live
 in our midst’.

Dart and Mahmood were both born in the UK, while Alom was born in Bangladesh but is a British citizen.
