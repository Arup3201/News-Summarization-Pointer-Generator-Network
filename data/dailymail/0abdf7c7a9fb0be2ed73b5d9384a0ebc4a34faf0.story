Orion Jones, 20, allegedly drunkenly peed on a waitress at a popular Florida bar on Saturday 

A Florida waitress thought it was beginning of a tropical rain but later made the realization she was being peed on by a man standing on the balcony above her.

Waitress Tia Cruz, 26, was working at Rick's Bar in Key West Florida early on Saturday morning when she 'began feeling something wet on her body.'

A fellow employee of the largest bar on the island pointed to a man identified as Orion Jones, 20, and said 'he is peeing on you!'

Following the alleged urination, bouncers chased Orion Jones through the bar and restrained him as another bar employee got a police officer.

The Smoking Gun reports that Orion could not be restrained by police so they were moved to taser him.

Jones was charged with disorderly intoxication and resisting arrest. He was also charged with underage drinking.

Jones has past offenses including for marijuana possession and also for burglary and trespassing.

In his report, Officer Curtiss Richardson noted that, 'In speaking with Jones, Jones expressed his desire to seek help for his alcohol problem.'

Jones posted bond and is scheduled for a February 2 arraignment on misdemeanor counts.
