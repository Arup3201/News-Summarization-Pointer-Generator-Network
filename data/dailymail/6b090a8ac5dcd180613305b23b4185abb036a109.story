A mother and her daughters, an aspiring musician about to release her first album, and a group of friends celebrating a birthday are among the people believed to have died in the Quebec train crash.

The death toll for the disaster, when a 73-car train carrying oil derailed and exploded, has reached 50, officials said.

One week after the crash the bells of Ste-Agnes, the Roman Catholic church on the edge of the disaster zone, tolled 50 times at midday in honor of the dead today, followed by a minute's silence.

Vigil: Friends and family of those who lost their lives in the Quebec train crash gather for a memorial

Twenty bodies have been found in the charred remains of  Lac-Megantic's town center, but the 30 people still missing are believed to be dead too.

In several cases, a snap decision to order another drink at the bar, or step outside for a cigarette was all that stood between them surviving or being added to the missing list, according to the Globe and Mail.

Musician Guy Buldoc had just completed a set at the Musi-Cafe bar, close to where the train derailed, on Saturday. While he went to the bar to order a beer his friend Yvon Richard went outside for a cigarette.

Mr Richard survived the blast, but Mr Buldoc, who was married and had two children, has not been seen since.

'The last words he said to me were, "Yvon, I really like playing with you. We have so much fun together",' Mr Ricard said.

A mother and her two young daughters are also believed to have been victims of the deadly crash, which sparked massive fires in the town centre. 

Talitha Coumi Bégnoche and her children, nine-year-old Bianka and four-year-old Alyssa have not been heard of since the disaster, but their home was close to the crash site. 

For parents Jimmy Sirois and Marie-Semie Alliance, their young daughter Milliana survived, but they lost their lives. 

Milliana had been staying with her grandmother because the family's apartment, across the road from the Musi Cafe, was so hot. Because her father was due to work the next day, her parents had stayed at home.

'It must be fate. Milliana, her time hadn’t come yet,' Solange Bélanger, the child's grandmother, said according to the Globe and Mail.

The explosions and fire from the crash destroyed 30 buildings in all, including the public library that housed irreplaceable historical archives.

About 2,000 people - a third of the population - were ordered to leave their homes, and the town's central business district was cordoned off throughout the week.

Gilles Fluet, a 65-year-old who used to work at a door-making factory, left the Musi-Cafe just moments before the first explosion and saw the train go by.

'It was moving at a hellish speed ... no lights, no signals, nothing at all,' he said. 'There was no warning. It was a black blob that came out of nowhere.'

He added: 'I realized they were oil tankers and they were going to blow up, so I yelled that to my friends and I got out of there. If we had stayed where we were, we would have been roasted.'

One of the victims who was unable to escape was 28-year-old Geneviève Breton, who had been due to release her first album.

The singer, who had already found fame on reality show Star Académie in 2009, was sitting outside Musi Cafe with her boyfriend at the time of the crash. She ducked back in for a bottle of water and was never seen again.

A group of four friends who were celebrating the 40th birthday of one of their children are also missing. 

Gaétan Lafontaine had managed to escape the initial explosion but has not been seen since he ran back to the Musi-Cafe to try to find his wife Joanie Turme, a librarian and mother of two.

Their sister-in-law Karine Lafontaine, and friend Marie-Noëlle Faucher, who had two teenage sons, are also missing.

One of the oldest confirmed victims was 93-year-old Éliane Parenteau-Boulanger, who had lived next to the railway line for years.

Her son, Michel Boulanger, said his mother - one of 11 siblings - had refused to move to a nursing home.

He added: 'She had a spirit like David Letterman. She makes you a part of the joke.'

Destroyed: Shells of buildings that were burned down in the blaze

Desolate: Firefighters douse the rail cars among burned trees and debris from the explosion

Many of the evacuees have been able to return home, as the investigation into the crash continues.

Investigators are also examining details of a fire on the same train just hours before the disaster.

A fire official said the train's power was shut down as standard operating procedure, meaning the train's air brakes would have been disabled. In that case, hand brakes on individual train cars would have been needed.

The derailment is Canada's worst railway disaster since a train plunged into a Quebec river in 1864, killing 99.
