French Open champion Maria Sharapova brushed off early hiccups with her serve to ease past British hope Samantha Murray in straight sets.

Fifth seed Sharapova indicated exactly why she sits 242 world ranking places ahead of 26-year-old Murray, coasting home 6-1 6-0 on Tuesday.

Stockport's Murray produced several smart winners, but wasted three break points in the first set, and never recovered.

Sealed with a kiss: Sharapova salutes the crowd after an emphatic win on day two of Wimbledon

Sharapova's routine victory will have 
gone some way to exorcising last year's lacklustre second-round exit at 
the hands of Portuguese qualifier Michelle Larcher de Brito.

The
 2004 champion exerted her five-time grand slam-winning class to consign
 wild card entrant Murray to a second successive first-round Wimbledon 
exit.

Murray followed Brits Johanna Konta, Dan Evans, Dan Cox, James Ward and Kyle Edmund in falling at the first hurdle.

Sharapova's
 rusty serve raised immediate problems, the frustrated Russian facing an
 immediate break point thanks to three double faults.

Out: Murray managed to win just one game as she made an early exit

Unable
 to capitalise on that early chance, Murray held her opening service 
game - only to let another break point slip in the very next game.

Murray's
 nerves bit as she dropped a straightforward game-winning volley into 
the net next, en route to handing Sharapova the first service break.

The fifth seed's confidence and service action restored, next came the power plays.

Sharapova held to love then broke Murray for a second time, before fending off a third break point to serve out the set.

The 27-year-old's merciless drive yielded a near-flawless second set, with Murray unable to claim even a single game.
