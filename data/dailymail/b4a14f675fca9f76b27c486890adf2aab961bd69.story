The Pope has once again shown his willingness to break with tradition by bowing to Muslim royal Queen Rania of Jordan.

As leader of the world's 1.2billion-strong Catholic community, protocol usually dictates that visitors bow to him when they meet him at the Vatican.

But when Rania came to the Holy See with her husband King Abdullah II on Thursday, he inverted that formality by lowering his head to her.

Beautiful: A Vatican official said Pope Francis 'is not interested in protocol'

He made no discernible bow toward her husband, the king. The Jordanian royals were leaving following a private audience with the pope in his library.

'Francis behaves as he did before he became pope and is not interested in protocol', a senior Vatican official told the Daily Telegraph.

Up until the 19th century, those meeting the pope stoop to kiss his slippers and, to this day, the tradition remains that all visitors, including women, bow to him, the official said.

The surprise move came after Pope Francis showed he is well in touch with what's popular in society today by posing for a 'selfie' with young Italian pilgrims in St Peter's Basilica, Vatican City.

It may be something more associated with the Justin Bieber, Victoria Beckham and Kelly Brook, but the leader of the Catholic Church showed he is more-than aware of today's hot topics.

The head of 1.2 billion Catholics worldwide has already amassed more than three million followers on the social networking site Twitter, with his latest offering believed to be the first ever 'papal selfie'.

Around 500 teenagers had travelled from the Diocese of Piacenza and Bobbio for a pilgrimage, and shared a private audience with the pontiff.

He was also presented a gift from his followers of a portrait of Jesus wearing a crown of thorns.

Pope Francis has made a concerted effort to understand and integrate with worldwide youth since he succeeded Pope Benedict XVI.

This was demonstrated when he attended Brazil's World Youth Day, with tens of thousands of people greeting him as he urged young Catholics to 'make disciples of all nations.'

Following his return to Vatican City from Brazil, he Tweeted: 'What an unforgettable week in Rio! Thank you, everyone. Pray for me. #Rio2013 #JMJ.'

Francis has already charmed the masses with his informal style, simplicity and sense of humour.

He has also being known to ring people up who have written to him asking for prayers or told him of personal tragedy.Â
