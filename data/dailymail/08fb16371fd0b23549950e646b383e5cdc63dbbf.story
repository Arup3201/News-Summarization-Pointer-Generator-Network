Posing up for fans' selfies is now a regular occurrence for many celebrities.

But these Wimbledon-going stars got a bit more than they bargained for when they fell victim to a pair of pranksters who pretended to take a picture but were in fact filming the unknowing tennis fans.

The ensuing footage from their awkward encounters has now been viewed by more than 300 people after it was uploaded to YouTube.

Awkward encounter: A prankster from The Gatsby Club poses next to Rafael Nadal for what he thinks is a selfie during Wimbledon. The Spaniard is unaware he is  being filmed

Stunt: The pair also targeted Peter Andre during the tournament which ended on Sunday 

Many of the stars, including Gossip Girl's Ed Westwick,  seem keen to get away asking 'what's going on?' while the pair tell them to 'wait for the flash', while others appear concerned the camera is not working.

Sky Sports News presenter Roger Clarke can be heard to ask 'does it need a flash?' as the pranksters beam at the camera.

But the pair were almost rumbled by presenter Ms Sykes who asked to see her photograph, and they confessed to Robson and X Factor's Chico that they were 'just messing', and had in fact been filming, much to the amusement of the celebrities involved.

Jim Parsons, who plays Sheldon Cooper in The Big Bang Theory, tries to pull a smile as he looks into the lense, not knowing video footage of him is being recorded 

Tiring of tricking the celebrities, the duo, who describe themselves on their YouTube page as 'Just 2 Regular Guys With a Passion to Make People Laugh', then turned their attention to unsuspecting members of the public.

They approached tennis fans, this time pretending to mistake them for stars including actresses Anne Hathaway, Kristen Stewart and Zooey Deschanel, to ask for a selfie, before repeating the trick.

Many of the targets were happy to play along, giggling as they waited for their pictures to be taken.

Stunt: Canadian player Milos Raonic, who was beaten in the semi-final by runner-up Roger Federer in this year's tournament, stops on his way to the court for an impromptu 'selfie'

Smile: Television presenter and model Melanie Skyes happily rests her head on the shoulder of the prankster, believing she is posing for a selfie. She then asks to see the end product, but the photographer refuses
