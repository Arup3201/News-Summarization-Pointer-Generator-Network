Michael Dunn, the man convicted of gunning down a black 17-year-old boy during an argument over loud music at a gas station, has been sentenced to life in prison without parole.

The 47-year-old software developer had faced the mandatory life sentence after he was found guilty last month of first-degree murder in the death of teenager Jordan Davis.

Davis, who was from Marietta, Georgia, was killed when Dunn fired 10 times into a car carrying four teenagers outside a gas station in Jacksonville, Florida in November 2012.

In a 25-second statement on Friday morning, Dunn apologized for the first time, WJXT reported.

'I want the Davis family to know I truly regret what happened,' he told the court. 'I'm sorry for their loss. If I could roll back time and do things differently, I would.'

But he still appeared to defend his actions, adding: 'I was in fear for my life and I did what I thought I had to do. Still, I am mortified I took a life, whether it was justified or not', WJXT reported.

His sentence also carries an additional 90 years for three convictions of attempted murder - 30 years for each count. He will also serve 15 years concurrently for firing a gun into an occupied vehicle. 

The teenager's devastated parents also spoke in court and, in an astonishing show of mercy, the boy's mother said she forgave Dunn.

'For me, there will be no college graduation,' Lucia McBath said. 'There will be no daughter-in-law. For me, there will be no future generation.

'I too must be willing to forgive. And so I choose to forgive you Mr. Dunn for taking my son's life. I pray that God has mercy on your soul.'

Ron Davis, Jordan Davis' father, added: 'My life as I had known it was shattered on November 23, 2012.

'I now call it Black Friday for a completely different reason... The old Ron Davis died that night with Jordan.'

Ron Davis' wife told the court that she still hears her husband crying in his sleep. 

Dunn's family chose not to speak in court as part of the victim impact statements.

Dunn's parents, who appeared emotionless as they attended the hearing, have never said anything publicly or to Davis' parents about their loss, WJXT reported.

Ron Davis previously said: 'They have not once - nobody in their family has come over to us and said, "We are sorry for your loss". And they have to live with that.'

Dunn was convicted of first-degree murder last month.

He had already been convicted of three counts of attempted second-degree murder in February but the jury was deadlocked on the first-degree count, meaning a second trial was ordered. 

The shooting unfolded after a shouting match between Dunn, who had just left his son's wedding, and a group of teenagers in a car at a gas station in November 2012.

Dunn asked Davis and the other teens in the car to turn down the music and a shouting match erupted between Dunn and Davis, who was sitting in the passenger side of the car.  

Dunn fired 10 times and one of the shots killed Davis. No one else in the SUV was injured. 

The defense argued that Dunn had shot at the car repeatedly because he felt in imminent danger.

The four teenagers were unarmed and no weapons were found inside their car.

During testimony, Dunn's fiancee told how they went back to their hotel, ordered a pizza and drank rum and Cokes straight after the killing. 

Rhonda Rouer, who was inside the store when the shooting happened, said she heard shots and was immediately told to get in the car by Dunn, who drove them back to their hotel.

The couple then ordered a meal, made drinks and went to bed.

The next morning when she woke up, the TV was on and she said she saw that Davis had died and she told Dunn she wanted to go home.

They drove straight back to Satellite Beach, canceling plans to have lunch with Dunn's son.

Dunn was arrested after they returned home that afternoon.
