Marc Allen Herklotz, 52, and his wife Robin Lauran Herklotz, 50, died trying to protect firefighters by removing propane tanks and ammunition from their home.

The bodies of the couple were found in the garage of their Black Forest home, close to where investigators believe the fire started.

to evacuate their home because they were thinking of the safety of 
firefighters .

The doors of the couple's car were open and officials said it appeared they were trying to evacuate.

Mr Wing said: 
'Marc was a shooting enthusiast and he had lots of ammunition and also 
propane tanks. A neighbor saw them loading them, trying to remove all of
it, so that it wouldn't pose a danger to firefighters.'

Wing described the couple as happy and added: 'It's a small consolation
for those that knew them that they were together in the end, but it
