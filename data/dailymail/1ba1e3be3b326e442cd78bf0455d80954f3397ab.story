An Oklahoma father is fighting to get custody of his twin daughters after their little brother was allegedly beaten to death by his estranged wife's boyfriend.

Brian Dockery said he and his wife, Tennille Downey, moved the family to Alaska over a year ago to be nearer her family, but the relationship broke down and he moved back to his native Oklahoma last June without his three children.

But on March 21, police were called to his Downey's Wasilla home because 23-month-old Ezekiel had stopped breathing.

Downey's boyfriend, Jyzyk Sharpe, who had been watching the children while Downey was at work, was arrested Friday and charged with second-degree murder by extreme indifference and manslaughter in Ezekiel's death.

The 40-year-old said the toddler slipped getting into the bath but the medical examiner's office found his injuries - several cuts, broken ribs and bruises on both lungs - were not consistent with a fall.Â

'I can't believe that an adult could be so vicious to a child so innocent and so sweet,' Dockery told News 9. 'Why was he trusted in a home with my children?'

Wasilla Police Department officers responded to an East Quincy Circle home just after 1 p.m. where police had been told CPR was in progress on Dockery. The boy was taken to Mat-Su Regional Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead shortly before 2 p.m.

'At the hospital, I observed Jyzyk Sharpe stuttering and displaying involuntary body movements, and (he) was unable to articulate his thoughts,' investigator Daniel Bennett wrote in a criminal complaint.

He added that Sharpe's aunt and uncle who knew him very well reported that they had not seen such behavior from him in the past.'

Sharpe told the investigator that Ezekiel fell while climbing into the bath to join his sisters. He said he was undressing to join them when he heard a smack.

'Sharpe was talking about (Dockery) and stated, "I saw him step over, and I could hear a fall, (a-a) slippery fall, I walk over and look and it was a split second, you just knew instantly, instantly, instantly,"' Bennett wrote, according to KTUU.com.

After the alleged fall, Sharpe said he
 brought the child to a bed, called his mother and 911 and began 
performing CPR. He told Bennett he'd broken the child's ribs during CPR.

Downey denies that Sharpe would have intentionally hurt the boy.

She told police she had been traveling home fro work in Anchorage when she received the frantic call.

'I asked (Downey) if she had any suspicion that (Sharpe) hurt her child at all,' Bennett wrote in the complaint.

'(Downey)
 stated that she did not have any suspicion that (Sharpe) would hurt her
 children because he takes care of the kids as if they were his own.'

In a sweep of the residence, police found a blood smear in the master bedroom, which tested positive to Ezekiel's blood. they also found a glass plate with white powder on it, that tested positive to cocaine.

Downey told investigators the drug was hers not Sharpe's and that the blood stain was from when the twins had pushed Ezekiel down, slitting his lip.

According to KTUU, Ezekiel suffered bruises around his head and back, lacerations to his lips, a fractured rib and a tear of his aorta arch, all of which are indicate 'major blunt force trauma.'

The medical examiner said the injuries were more consistent with 'a victim in a car accident' rather than a fall or CPR.

Dockery's family held a memorial service in Seminole last Monday for the little boy who would have turned two on April 18.

The Swearingen funeral home was covered in pictures of Ezekiel's smiling face.

Lost: 'Ezekiel was a beautiful, pure, innocent spirit,' the toddler's aunt Natasha Parks said of the boy, pictured. 'We were robbed of his life. The suffering is unspeakable and we're utterly devastated'

Twins: 'I think they've endured enough. I'm ready for them to come home. Their home is here with me and my family,' Dockery said of his daughters, pictured.

A proper funeral however, is on hold. 
The family told News 9 that Ezekiel's body is in a holding room in 
Alaska and cannot be buried until around June because the ground needs 
to thaw out.

Dockery said he hopes to bring his son's body to Oklahoma and have him buried in Seminole.

'Ezekiel
 was a beautiful, pure, innocent spirit,' the toddler's aunt Natasha 
Parks told News 9. 'We were robbed of his life. The suffering is 
unspeakable and we're utterly devastated.'

The family want Ezekiel's 4-year-old daughters to come back to Seminole.

'I think they've endured enough. I'm ready for them to come home. Their home is here with me and my family,' Dockery said. 'And I'm not going to stop until I get my girls.'

Parks described the plight as 'the biggest fight of our lives.'

'It's too late for Ezekiel, but it's not too late for Ava and Veloria,' she said. 'We love them dearly, and we need justice for Ezekiel.'

Sharpe is due in court for a hearing on April 14.
