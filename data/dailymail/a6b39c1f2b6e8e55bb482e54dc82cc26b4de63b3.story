Microsoft is said to have drafted in the team behind its Surface tablet to help test prototypes of its smartwatch.

According to technology site The Verge, sources familiar with Microsoft's Surface plans revealed the company had taken the steps to try and get its wearable tech to market.

These claims follow rumours that emerged in April which stated Microsoft was working on a touch-enabled watch as the company aims to cash in on the anticipated boom in wearable electronics.

It's time: Microsoft chairman Bill Gates shows off the firm's smartwatch technology in 2004. Now it has been claimed the company has asked Asian firms to ship 1.5-inch displays for a potential watch-style device

Nothing has been officially confirmed by Microsoft yet, but rumours claim:

The watch will have a removable band that will come in a red, black, yellow and blue.

It will be made of oxynitride aluminium, a translucent form of the metal.

Microsoft's smartwatch is also said to run a version of Windows 8.

Prototypes of the device are being tested by the Surface team and the watch could have the connector featured on the tablet.

At the time, the computing giant reportedly asked 
Asian suppliers to ship 1.5in displays for a potential watch-style 
device and one supply executive said he had met with Microsoft 
researchers and developers.

Whether
Microsoft will actually end up producing the watch is uncertain, but 
some investors and technology firms are expecting a boom in wearable 
electronics, reported the Wall Street Journal.

The U.S. company experimented with smartwatches in 2004 with a product called SPOT, which used FM radio signals to send instant messages and view news headlines, reported CNN.

But production ceased four years later and the SPOT project, which stood for Smart Personal Object Technology, was eventually pulled last year.

The new Microsoft watch is believed to have a removable band that will come in a red, black, yellow and blue.

It is also thought to be made of oxynitride aluminium, a translucent form of the metal and will run a version of Windows 8.

Earlier this week Apple was said to be hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its own smartwatch - dubbed the iWatch.

According to the Financial Times (FT), the tech firm wants to bring in fresh pairs of eyes to look at the device because its in-house developers may be struggling to solve the problems.

A source told the paper that Apple started 'hiring aggressively' in recent weeks, which suggests that the smartwatch is nowhere near being ready for release and could be pushed back to next year.

Some gadgets such as Nike’s FuelBand are intended to measure physical exercise, while others can perform similar functions to a smartphone such as receiving text messages or taking photos.

California-based startup firm Pebble Technology now makes a watch that wirelessly synchronises with smartphones and vibrates to alert users of incoming phone calls, emails and Twitter posts.

And a group of students from India have already begun selling an Android-powered watch called Andoirdly.

Google is also thought developing a smartwatch as well as its eyewear gadget Google Glass. The search giant is set to use its Android software and will battle against Apple's iWatch and a Samsung gadget.

'We see growing demand for wearable gadgets as the size of the smartphone has become too big to carry around'

‘We see growing demand for wearable gadgets as the size of the smartphone has become too big to carry around,’ analyst Wanli Wang told the Wall Street Journal.

‘A smartwatch that is compatible with a smartphone and other electronics devices would be attractive to consumers.’

One research firm anticipates the market for wearable smart electronics to be a £7billion industry within just three years.

College students from India have launched the first fully-featured Android smart watch with built-in Bluetooth, GPS, Wi-Fi and a camera. The Androidly device can also be used to make calls and send texts and costs £150
