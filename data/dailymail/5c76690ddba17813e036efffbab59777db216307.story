Monty Python star Michael Palin has backed calls to save a picturesque seaside resort from having a Costa Coffee.

Southwold in Suffolk has become a hit destination for upmarket holidaymakers, with the coffee giant now looking to install its first branch in the trendy seaside resort.

Palin, 69, also famous for his travel programmes, spoke out after campaigners lost the latest round of their battle to keep Costa out.

Speaking at the re-launch of the Suffolk resort's Electric Picture Palace cinema, he declared it was important to protect Southwold's 'harmony' to prevent it becoming like other seaside towns across the country.

His outburst came after Costa Coffee was given the green light last week to open a cafi at 70 High Street, Southwold, a move which objectors fear will harm the business of its independent traders.

He said 'I don't think anywhere can totally resist change, but Southwold is a very special place. It's a town full of harmony and architectural features that go together beautifully and the fact that is still here is wonderful.

'I wouldn't be very happy if they started knocking through walls and putting in big supermarkets.

'Southwold has got a uniqueness that comes from being slightly cut off, but we have to keep its unique image because we do not want it to look the same as every other seaside town.

'The place has such a wonderful feeling - why would you want to change it much?'

The legendary comic fell in love with Southwold after holidaying in north Suffolk as a child and went on to meet his wife Helen in the town, while his parents retired to the area in 1966.

Fictional Southwold Estate is the country estate of the family of Lady Marjorie Bellamy in the ITV British drama Upstairs, Downstairs, and the town has been used as the setting for numerous films and television programmes.

Julie Myerson, setting her 2003 murder novel Something Might Happen in Southwold, called it 'a sleepy, slightly self-satisfied seaside town'.

1984 writer George Orwell (then known as Eric Blair) spent time as a teenager and in his thirties in Southwold, living at his parents' home.
