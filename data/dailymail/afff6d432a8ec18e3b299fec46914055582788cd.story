Swansea have announced they will be appealing against the red card shown to goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski during Sunday's Barclays Premier League defeat by West Ham.

The Poland international was dismissed in the 68th minute of the match at Upton Park for impeding West Ham substitute Diafra Sakho as he burst through on goal.

However, Swansea manager Garry Monk said after the 3-1 loss that he expected the club to appeal the decision, saying there was both a handball by Sakho in the build-up and that it was not a clear goalscoring opportunity either, and on Monday the Welsh club confirmed they had been in touch with the FA.

'The FA will make a decision on the appeal ahead of Sunday's Barclays Premier League clash with Spurs at the Liberty Stadium.'
