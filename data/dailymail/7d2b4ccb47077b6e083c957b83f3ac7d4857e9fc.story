More bodies may be trapped beneath the police helicopter that plunged into a busy pub, officials feared last night.

Nine people are now known to have been killed – including the doomed aircraft’s civilian pilot and two police officers on board – while 32 pub-goers were injured.

As the scale of Friday night’s disaster in Glasgow unfolded, investigators refused to rule out foul play as they examined possible causes of the crash, including whether the pilot was shot at or blinded by a ‘laser pen’.

Witnesses reported hearing the helicopter engine ‘misfiring’ at 10.25pm, and air accident investigators are examining whether there was a mechanical fault.

But there were also fears the horrific accident could have been caused by a powerful green laser beam from a pen-like device shone into the eyes of the pilot – or even a firearm.

There have been an increasing number of near-misses caused by the blinding laser devices in recent months.

Police Scotland said investigators will ‘retain an open mind’. On a day of national mourning, Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmon warned that the death toll could rise.

Witnesses said the police helicopter 'dropped like a stone' from the sky

Victim: PC Anthony Collins was commended last year for risking his life to save a drowning woman

He said last night: ‘I should say there’s an area which is still to be searched, the area which is underneath the helicopter itself. We have to prepare ourselves for the possibility that there could be further fatalities to come.’

The police helicopter fell out of the sky ‘like a stone’ and smashed through the roof of The Clutha, one of the city’s best-known pubs, when it was packed with 120 revellers on Friday night.

The experienced pilot was named as David Traill, 51, a former RAF flight lieutenant who served in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Tributes were paid to Mr Traill and the two police officers – Kirsty Nelis, 36, and Tony Collins, 43 – who had been returning from a police operation to their heliport two miles away.

Among the fatalities in the pub was 48-year-old Gary Arthur, from Paisley, whose heartbroken daughter Chloe, 18, a Celtic and Scotland international footballer, paid tribute to him, saying: ‘I promise to do you proud. I love you with all my heart.’

Other families faced an agonising wait to see if their missing loved ones are discovered buried in the wreckage.

A ninth body was found by emergency services on Sunday.

DCC Rose Fitzpatrick said on Sunday: 'The site is extremely challenging and the efforts of colleagues from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and investigators have been painstaking.

'We can now confirm that Samuel McGhee died during the incident on Friday. Our thoughts are with his family and friends tonight as they are with all those affected by this tragedy.

'Sadly I can also confirm the discovery of a further body within the site. This takes to nine the total number of people who died on Friday night. 

'Our absolute priority has been to locate the bodies of people who were within the pub at the time of the incident and recover them safely.

'This process takes time, as formal identification procedures have to take place before we can notify relatives and publicly confirm identities.

'We are doing all we can to support the families of those who have lost loved ones. It is essential that we maintain sensitivity and dignity for the families of the deceased.'

The wreckage of the Eurocopter EC135 T2 will be transported to the headquarters of the Air Accident Investigation branch in Farnborough, Hampshire.

After visiting some of the injured at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she felt humbled by the stories she had heard of off-duty medical staff rushing to work in the crash aftermath, and members of the public queuing to give blood the following morning.

Brave: PC Kirsty Nelis, who was killed in the crash, won a commendation for tackling a hammer-wielding thug

Both police officers killed in the Glasgow helicopter tragedy had won praise for bravery.

Kirsty Nelis, 36, won a commendation for tackling a hammer-wielding thug trapped in a lift with her, while Anthony Collins, 43, risked his life to save a drowning woman.

The heroine policewoman was just 25 when she and a fellow officer had been called to reports of a dozen youths drinking and throwing bottles in Greenock, Renfrewshire.

PC Nelis saw one of the teenagers vandalising a lift with a hammer and moved to arrest him.

She recalled: ‘I was petrified – I felt the lift going up and I didn’t know when it was going to stop. I just had to get the cuffs on him and the hammer off him.’ 

In 2010, she married fellow officer Mark Nelis, now 46 and a community sergeant in their home district of Inverclyde.

The couple – who had no children – last year bought a £250,000 detached four-bedroom house in Inverkip.

Her brother, believed to be called Keith, is a fire officer in Glasgow and is understood to have been among the first to arrive at the horrific scene on Friday night.

PC Nelis’s Facebook friends have changed their profile pictures to a thin blue line crossing a black square in her memory. Andrina Romano posted: ‘You will never be forgotten.’ 

PC Collins received a national award last year after diving into a canal to save a drowning woman. He is understood to have been married with at least one child, a boy in his teens.

At the family’s semi-detached home in the Clarkston area of Glasgow last night, a relative said: ‘I’m sorry but we’re not saying anything at the moment.’ 

Those confirmed or feared dead among music fans at The Clutha pub included Gary Arthur, 48, a call centre worker. 

John McGarrigle, 59, a poet, was sitting at his usual table immediately beneath where the helicopter hit and has not been heard from since.

His 39-year-old son, also called John, said: ‘Dad sat at the same place every night and he was sitting at a table exactly where the helicopter landed.’

He said he planned to stand outside The Clutha until all the casualties were removed.

Mr McGarrigle Snr’s friend Sammy McGhee, 56, from Glasgow, was confirmed dead on Sunday.

Mark O’Prey, 44, is believed to be another victim.

Condolences came from the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, the day after messages of support from the Queen and Prime Minister David Cameron.

Charles wrote: ‘My wife and I wanted to send our most heartfelt thoughts and sympathy to the families of those who were lost or injured.’

The Clutha pub – a 1960s haunt of Billy Connolly and Gerry Rafferty – had been packed with revellers in high spirits when the stricken helicopter plummeted.

Horrified witnesses saw the dark blue aircraft dropping ‘like a stone’ with its rotor blades not spinning. Inside, the band was playing so loudly that at first nobody realised what had happened.

A puff of dust and a wooden panel falling off a wall prompted a joke from one of the musicians of local ska band Esperanza, who said: ‘Looks like we’re bringing the roof down.’

But then, in horrifying slow-motion, the ceiling started to bow and collapse. A ‘whoosh’ sound filled the room, described by one witness as ‘like when you take the seal off something’.

Shouts of alarm rang out and a thick cloud of ‘burning’ black dust swept through the crowd, then there was a loud crack as the mangled helicopter burst through the ceiling.

Kenny Hamilton, a 48-year-old painter and decorator, was knocked sideways by the ‘buckling’ bar gantry, and suffered suspected cracked ribs.

Nine people have been confirmed dead so far in the crash, however the death toll could still rise

That did not stop him helping several people lift the shattered bar so another injured man could get out.

Another survivor, Grace Maclean, said: ‘I could barely see a few inches in front of me. I could feel hands grabbing me and people shouting, “Get out”.’

Alleena Coupe said she and her husband Gary were saved only because they had been sitting near the window of the busy bar, but had decided to move. She said: ‘The dust was choking, it burned our throats. People were running about and panicking.’

Yesterday some survivors made a painful return to the harrowing scene bearing flowers – and scars which may take a lifetime to heal.
