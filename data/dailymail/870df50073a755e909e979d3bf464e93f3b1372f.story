Sixty-per-cent of America's 21million university students will graduate with an average debt of $27,300 – but not those who choose to romance their way out of a financial burden.

An increasing number of students are turning to rich benefactors, or sugar daddies, to fund their education – with the University of Texas topping the list of signups last year.

Sugar daddy dating site Seekingarrangement.com reports that it had 425 new sign-ups from the University of Texas in 2014.

The second and third fastest-growing 'sugar baby schools' are Arizona State University with 403 and New York University with 398.

Tuition prices rose by 2.9 per cent - with the rise outstripping a 2.0 per cent increase for the Consumer Price Index.

In total, 1.4million students turned to seekingarrangement.com in their search for benefactors to help fund their education, it said. This represents an increase of 42 per cent.

The cost of education is such that even students from upper-middle class and high income families are turning to sugar daddies, with 35 per cent of those signing up to the site coming from those backgrounds.

Some students have reported receiving $3,000 a month in allowances as a result of hitting it off with an older man.

Brandon Wade, CEO and founder of Seekingarrangement.com, said that his site is tackling a problem the government ignores.

He said: 'While other countries seek to create opportunity and provide a better start for students by abolishing tuition fees or lowering them to reasonable amounts, Congress continues to ignore the problem. The average debt is more than what most of these new graduates will make in a year.'

Undergraduates and graduate students alike contributed to the increase in student sign-ups to the site. 

'It's not only undergraduates, but those pursuing their masters are turning to the site,' said Wade.

'The average debt for graduate students has more than quadrupled since 1989, which is a problem since the fastest growing careers for the coming years require these degrees.'

 Financial assistance is not the only allure, though. Many students turn to sugar daddies for job opportunities either directly or through networking.
