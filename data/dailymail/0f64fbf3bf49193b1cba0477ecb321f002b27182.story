* No driver has ever lost a world title winning 10 grands prix in a season, or at least winning four races in a row, as Hamilton has achieved this year.

* In the last race in Brazil, Mercedes set a new record for one-twos in a single season with 11, surpassing McLaren’s 1988 feat with Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost at the wheel.

* Rosberg’s victory saw Mercedes equal the record number of race wins in a season of 15 held jointly by Ferrari (twice in 2002 and 2004) and McLaren in 1988.

* The duo have also chalked up 30 podium finishes between them, again a new record.

* Mercedes could yet equal Red Bull’s 2011 record for poles in a season with 18. The Brackley-based marque currently have 17 from 18 races.

* In the previous five Abu Dhabi Grands Prix, Hamilton has started from the front row on four occasions, but won only once, in 2011.

* The event marks McLaren’s final race with engine partner Mercedes-Benz after 20 seasons. During that time McLaren have won 78 times and claimed three drivers’ titles and one constructors’ title.

* McLaren, though, have now gone 37 races without a win. Their worst drought is 48 over seasons 1994, 1995 and 1996.

* Sauber stand on the brink of the worst season in their history. The team scored just five points in 1999, but have yet to score this year.

* In Abu Dhabi there have been three different winners of the five races so far - Vettel (2009, 2010 & 2013), Hamilton (2011), Kimi Raikkonen (2012).

* However, in the five races, only once has a driver won from pole - Vettel in 2010. In three, the polesitter has failed to finish.
