They tour the world, party whenever they want and live truly lavish lifestyles but the hedonistic habits of musicians have a serious downside – they are likely to die younger than their vocally challenged counterparts.

A professor at Sydney University has studied seven decades of popular musicians’ lifespans and found they were up to 25 years shorter than the comparable US population, in findings published on The Conversation.

Dianna Kenny, Professor of Psychology and Music at University of Sydney, was eager to find out why so many pop stars die young and examined 12,665 stars from all popular genres who died between 1950 and June 2014.

Tragic: Amy Winehouse, seen here performing in Los Angeles in 2007, died at the age of 27 from alcohol poisoning on 23 July 2011. The British singer had suffered from years of drug and alcohol abuse

Astonishingly 90 per cent of them, 11,478, also happened to be male.

Much has been debated about the existence of a ‘27 club’, an age when a whole host of talented musicians at the height of their fame have died, often through suicide involving drug or alcohol misuse.

After Kurt Cobain, who struggled with heroin addiction, illness and depression, was found dead - having shot himself in the head in April 1994 - the devastating effect fame had on his happiness was revealed.

Before him, came the likes of Rolling Stones rocker Brian Jones in 1969, Alan Wilson, Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin in 1970 and Jim Morrison in 1971.

Jimi Hendrix, one of the most talented electric guitarists in history, died in London in 1970 at the age of 27

Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain's body was found in a greenhouse above the garage of his Seattle home in 1994. He shot himself in the head at the age of 27

When British singer Amy Winehouse also died at the age of 27 from alcohol poisoning, on 23 July 2011, following years of alcohol and drug addiction, the theory was compounded.

Professor Kenny found that the early 1990s were the peak years for death by suicide for musicians, with the amount of stars taking their own lives rising from 5.9 per cent in the decade before to 9.5 per cent.

But she also discovered that over the six decades she studied, suicide rates were between two and seven times greater in musicians than the US population.

American rock singer Janis Joplin was found dead in her Los Angeles hotel room, apparently of a drug overdose, on October 4, 1970. She was also 27

American singer-songwriter and guitarist Jeff Buckley, seen here performing at Glastonbury in 1995, drowned in 1997 while swimming fully clothed

Brian Jones, the founder and original bandleader of iconic rock group the Rolling Stones who fell into drug and alcohol addiction, died at the age of 27 in 1969. He drowned in the swimming pool at his home in Sussex, England, after splitting from the band

As well as suicide, murder is also a big risk for musicians.

The academic revealed that homicide rates were up to eight times greater amongst musicians than the US population.

The fatal shootings of Tupac Shakar, who died in 1996 when he was just 25-years-old during a drive-by shooting, and The Notorious B.I.G who died at the age of 24 in 1997, are just two examples from the staggering statistics.

Musician homicide rates peaked at 6.6 per cent in the 1990s after it was just 4 per cent in the 1980s and 5.9 per cent in and around 1970.

Contrastingly, in the 50s and 60s more musicians died from accidents such as plane and car crashes, such as Buddy Holly and Otis Redding.

Whitney Houston - the most awarded female act of all time, who sold over 200 million records worldwide – died at the age of 48 on February 11, 2012. Her body was found in a bath tub at a hotel in Beverly Hills, California

Lead singer of The Doors Jim Morrison died at the age of 27 in Paris after an alleged heroin overdose

Michael Jackson, seen here at London's Wembley stadium during his Bad world tour in 1988, died at the age of 50 while he was preparing for his comeback tour This Is It 

Alan Wilson, leader of the the American blues band Canned Heat, died at the age of 27. An autopsy identified his cause of death as accidental acute barbiturate intoxication

According to Professor Kenny’s research female musicians tend to die in their early 60s rather than their 80s like the rest of us.

Whereas male musicians die in their late 50s compared to non-rock stars who die around 75.

Whitney Houston - the most awarded female act of all time, who sold over 200 million records worldwide – died at the age of 48 on February 11, 2012.

Coroner’s ruled she had accidentally drowned in the bathtub, with heart disease and cocaine use listed as contributing factor, but her struggle with fame, drink and drugs over the decades was well documented.

Rapper Tupac Shakur died when he was just 25-years-old during a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas

Rival rapper The Notorious B.I.G died in LA in 1997 in a drive-by shooting at the age of 24. He had feared for his life for some time as part of an ongoing East Coast–West Coast feud and because of his level of fame 

Meanwhile, Michael Jackson also tragically died before his time at the age of 50 in 2009.

The singer was preparing for his comeback tour This Is It when he died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication, after suffering from cardiac arrest.

The coroner ruled his death a homicide and his personal physician Conrad Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter.

Professor Kenny concluded that the reason musicians die younger than those that don’t make a living out of singing on stage is because the ‘pop music “scene” fails to provide boundaries and to model and expect acceptable behaviour’.

She claims their lifestyle ‘valorises outrageous behaviour and the acting out of aggressive, sexual and destructive impulses that most of us dare only live out in fantasy’.
