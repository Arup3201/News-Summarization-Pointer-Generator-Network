A Facebook paedophile who is described as ‘every parent’s nightmare’ has escaped being sent to jail.

Timothy Storey, 34, appeared the perfect middle-class husband yet groomed hundreds of children on the social networking site.

By posing online as a privately-educated teenager, he persuaded girls as young as 12 to film themselves naked for his twisted pleasure.

Alias: Using the name 'Tim Stone' and this picture of him as a younger man, Storey forced girls to film themselves

Storey, who is married to an Oxford-educated lawyer although they have been separated for over a year, would threaten to tell the girls’ parents if they tried to end the vile abuse.

Despite being convicted of eight child sex charges, he was given only a three-year rehabilitation order.

MPs and charities said the ‘appalling’ sentence sent out a terrible message to the young victims brave enough to give evidence against him. The case was last night referred to Attorney General Dominic Grieve by Tory MP David Burrowes.

He said: ‘The sentence is woefully inadequate and out of touch with the increasing dangers of online sexual abuse.’

The MP has backed the Mail’s campaign for automatic blocks on online porn unless adults opt out.

To his family and friends, Storey was an ordinary young man with a love of beer and cricket and married to the love of his life. They had a dream wedding in 2010.

Behind the facade he was secretly spending hours on Facebook, posing as a wealthy and sporty prep school teenager called Tim Stone.

On his fake Facebook profile, Storey claimed he left Dover College – an independent boarding school which charges up to £27,000 a year – in 2011.

Dozens of teenagers can still be seen 
as his friends on Facebook, many of them posing in provocative clothing.
 Storey lists ‘sexercise, girls and naughtiness’ among his interests.

The
 police investigation began last year when a 14-year-old girl told 
officers a Tim Stone had sent her sexual images via Facebook two years 
earlier.

She said he asked 
her to send sexual images in return. Officers at Scotland Yard’s 
specialist child exploitation unit quickly discovered that Storey was 
responsible for the account.

When police raided his home they discovered he had falsely amassed almost 800 Facebook friends, all of them girls aged under 18.

He had sent hundreds of private messages to them asking them to send him explicit images of themselves and sent images of his genitals in return.

They discovered another victim, a 13-year-old girl, was encouraged to set up a Skype account which he used to make her strip and display intimate parts of her body.

The girl said she was scared and believed Storey knew where she lived and would tell her parents.

The girl confided in a 13-year-old friend who told Storey to back off. But, in a chilling twist, this girl and another friend became his victims too.

After raiding Storey’s home in Peckham, South East London, police discovered more than 3,000 saved pages of Skype chat which helped them identify further victims.

Seventy-two indecent images of children were found on a laptop and on Storey’s Blackberry mobile phone.

He admitted eight counts of inciting children to engage in sexual activity and two counts of making indecent images of children.

Storey, who is originally from Folkestone, Kent, was sentenced to a 36-month sex offender’s programme at Woolwich Crown Court on Monday.

He was also handed a sexual offences 
prevention order, which is similar to an Asbo, and ordered to sign the 
sex offenders register for five years.

Under
 the latest guidelines, the maximum penalty for inciting a child under 
13 to engage in sexual activity is 14 years behind bars.

This
 is reduced substantially if there is no physical contact. But Mr 
Burrowes said: ‘The impact of predators on child victims is the same 
whether online or in person. Sentences should reflect that equivalence.’

Priti Patel, another Tory MP, said: ‘It is appalling that such a soft sentence has been given for what is overt internet grooming and dangerous behaviour that threatens the safety of our children.

‘This reflects the failure in our criminal justice system when it comes to dealing with the internet.

‘We
 need firm and clear sentences to be handed out to individuals who are 
clearly abusing youngsters in such a horrific and vile way online.’

John
 Carr, of the Children’s Charities’ Coalition on Internet Safety, said: 
‘Storey is obviously a dangerous man and a lot of people will be 
surprised with the leniency of this sentence.

‘A
 lot of people will think he should be in prison. People are noticing 
that fewer and fewer of these offenders are going to jail. It seems 
there has been a shift in sentencing process without a change in 
sentencing policy.’

Detective Inspector Neal Burton, who investigated the case, believes Storey claimed many more victims.

‘He
 is every parent’s nightmare, exploiting and abusing children over the 
internet,’ he said. ‘The victims showed much courage in coming forward 
to report his activities and helping to bring him to justice.

MP David Burrowes

‘He is a serial sex offender who I believe may have abused other victims who have not yet come forward and spoken to the police or confided in anyone else.’

The case is the latest to highlight the frightening trend of paedophiles using Facebook and other sites.

The Government has been warned that social networking and webcams are handing predators direct access to the bedrooms of naive children.
