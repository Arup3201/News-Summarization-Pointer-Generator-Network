More than 150 passengers heading to Edinburgh for New Year's Eve were left terrified after their plane was forced into an emergency landing after one of its two engines failed.

The easyJet flight from Geneva got into trouble over Cambridge and was forced to divert to Luton Airport in Bedfordshire yesterday afternoon.

Its pilot took the decision to take down the Airbus A319 after oil began leaking into one of its engines, which he had to shut off.

Waiting for the plane on the Luton runway were a fire engine and two support vehicles, and trains to and from the airport were temporarily suspended at around 2pm as a result.

The landing was made more difficult as the plane was being battered by strong winds and heavy rain, causing severe turbulence.

An EasyJet spokeswoman told MailOnline the captain 'took the decision to divert as a precaution only' and that 'all passengers were given some refreshments prior to boarding another flight to Edinburgh about an hour and half later.'

Passenger Rody Iskandar was on board the flight and took a picture of the stricken plane as people on board were evacuated.

He was on his way to Edinburgh for Hogmanay when the plane was diverted but still made it to celebrate the start of 2013.

'Emergency arrival in new year eve. Luckily we all safe,' he tweeted.

Luton Airport said today that no other flights were delayed as a result of the incident and that the runway remained open throughout.

'Anything like this where there is a potential issue it is a standard process that a fire engine be sent,' she added.
