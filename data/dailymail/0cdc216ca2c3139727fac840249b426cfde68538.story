The sister of a Muslim fanatic who died in Syria after bragging about his ‘5-star jihad’ was arrested today by police investigating a Syria-related terrorism plot.

Tamannah Shaharin, 29, idolised her jihadi brother Iftekhar Jaman.

The 23-year-old chef from Portsmouth became one of the most infamous British extremists when he boasted on BBC Newsnight that the ‘holy war’ in Syria was like ‘5-star jihad’ because of its ‘relaxing’ nature. He also claimed it was ‘cool’ to hold a gun.

Arrested: Tamannah Shaharin, 29, idolised her jihadi brother Iftekhar Jaman, who became one of the most infamous British extremists when he boasted on TV that the ‘holy war’ in Syria was like ‘5-star jihad’

His tweets and video messages earned him a following and the adoration of his family, who said he had done ‘an honourable thing’ after he was killed in December last year while taking part in an assault on an arms depot. 

But yesterday counter- terrorism officers swooped on his former home in Portsmouth and arrested his brothers – Tuhin, 26, and Mustakim, 23 – as well as their 29-year-old sister at her £500,000 home in Greenwich, South-east London, on suspicion of being involved in a Syria-related terrorism plot. 

Police from the South East Counter-terrorism Unit also held his parents – Enu Miah, 57, and Hena Choudhury, 48 – who are suspected of failing to disclose information about acts of terrorism.

Mr Miah is also accused of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts and raising cash and property for the Syrian fighters who flocked to follow his son.

Last night it emerged that Shaharin – a director of the Muslim Youth Project in Portsmouth – had written on Twitter that she wanted to give advice about the Islamic state but feared the FBI would monitor her tweets.

Police were standing guard outside the terrace house in Southsea, where the door window had been smashed, and police tape surrounded the property

Jaman's family, including parents Hena Choudhury, 48, Enu Miah, 57, and younger brother Mustakim, 23, had still been living at the house at the time of his death

She said: ‘Sometimes you really wana tweet away hardcore advice about khilafa (Islamic state) but scared some under cover fbi would hold it against u!!!’.

The glass panel of the door to the house had been smashed, and neighbours said police had arrived at around 6.30am

Yesterday detectives raided her semi-detached home where she lives with her husband Muhib Ud Deen Mohammed Khan, 33, and his parents. 

A dozen policemen searched the property and vehicles in the driveway.

Shaharin’s husband, son and parents-in-law arrived home last night under police guard and picked up some belongings before leaving. They declined to comment.

Yesterday a woman who worked at the Muslim Youth Project said: ‘I can’t believe it. Tamannah is a lovely woman – there was nothing radical or extreme about her. She took the death of her brother badly.’

Earlier, detectives raided her parents’ terraced home in Southsea.

Neighbours were awoken to the sound of breaking glass as police smashed the front door. 

The family’s business, Masala Takeaway in Portsmouth, was also raided.

Yesterday, just hours before the police raid, Mustakim wrote on Twitter: ‘Sometimes you have to take a side or you will be held accountable for your inaction.’

Jaman, a former Sky call centre worker, left the UK last year after telling his parents he was going to study in Turkey, but he slipped across the border to Syria on May 14.

In a series of calls back to England, Jaman managed to persuade five of his friends from Portsmouth and another three from Manchester to go out and fight alongside him.

A police spokesman said the arrests were linked to overseas conflicts and there was no immediate threat to the UK.

Speaking on BBC Newsnight, Jaman had described fighting in Syria as ‘5-star jihad’ because of its ‘relaxing’ nature. He had also urged fellow Britons to join him, using his Twitter account to glory in his hate-filled missions

Police raided a flat in west London last week as part of an ongoing investigation into terrorism

The news comes as Scotland Yard must decide today whether to charge three suspected Islamist extremists following a series of dawn raids last week, while detectives continue to question three men arrested by counter-terror police in London yesterday.

The men - 'F', aged 24, 'G', 21 and 'H', 25, were arrested in Central London and are now in custody. Police said the two operations are not related.

On Wednesday a warrant of further detention was granted by a magistrates' court for the five men arrested on Tuesday  October 7. 'A', 21, and 'B', 'C', 'D' and 'E', all 20 years old.

'B' and 'D' were yesterday released from custody, while 'A', 'C' and 'E' remained in custody at a central London police station last night.

A search has taken place at a business address in west London and searches were continuing last night at a further four residential addresses in north west London.
