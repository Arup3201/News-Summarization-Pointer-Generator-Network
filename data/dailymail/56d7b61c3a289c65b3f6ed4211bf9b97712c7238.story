A Fort Worth, Texas man’s pregnant wife is on life support and he wants her taken off even though the move would also leave their baby dead.

Erick Munoz says his wife Marlise, 33, who hasn’t regained consciousness since suffering an embolism in November, would not have wanted to live life hooked up to a machine.

The life of the unborn baby, which may have already suffered irreparable damage, now hangs in the balance and Munoz says doctors should fulfill her wishes--which would end the lives of both his wife and their unborn child.

Happier times: Erick Munoz (right, holding their 1-year-old son Mateo) says his wife Marlise (left) did not want to ever be kept alive with a machine. But because she is pregnant, Texas law requires she receive all life saving measures

'I don't agree with this law': Erick says he can't fulfill his promise to his wife because of the Texas law, which applies to all pregnant women, even those with do not resuscitate orders

But in Texas, doctors must take all 
life saving measures to preserve the life of an unborn baby, which in 
this case remains too immature to survive outside the womb.

That means doctors' hands—along with Erick’s—are tied.

‘I don't agree with this law,’ Erick told ABC News as he sadly browsed old photos of his wife and their 1-year-old son Mateo.

Erick and Marlise were both paramedics. Erick says he and his wife had seen enough in the line of duty to know what they would want in this situation.

And this isn’t it.

‘We knew what her wishes were,’ Erick, who found his wife unconscious on their kitchen floor and fought in vain to resuscitate her, told WFAA.

However, Marlise’s wishes don’t matter.

Per Texas state law: ‘A person may 
not withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatment under this subchapter
 from a pregnant patient.’

The
 couple had merely discussed their mutual desire to never be kept alive 
by a machine and hadn’t actually signed a do not resuscitate order.

But that wouldn’t have made a difference.

Texas
 gives rights to the unborn fetus over the mother’s wishes even when a 
DNR has been signed, where the state’s form reads, ‘I understand under 
Texas law this directive has no effect if I have been diagnosed as 
pregnant.’

Tragedy: Erick found Marlise unconscious on the kitchen floor in late November. She'd likely suffered an embolism that cut off oxygen to her brain. She was 14 weeks pregnant and has never regained consciousness

'We knew what her wishes were': Both Erick and Marlise were both paramedics. He found her collapsed on November 26 and initiated CPR, but it was no use. Erick says the couple had seen enough in the line of duty to know they wouldn't want to be kept alive by machines

Questions: In Texas, state law stipulates that, in cases of pregnant women, DNRs do not apply and all measures must be taken to save the life of the fetus. Meanwhile, it remains unclear how the fetus was affected when Marlise's brain was deprived of oxygen for an extended period

That means Marlise and Erick’s baby will likely be taken to full term, or for as long as it appears safe for the fetus to remain in the womb.

Now at 18 weeks, the fetus still cannot be safely delivered. Only at 24 to 28 weeks would doctors deem it safe to deliver via cesarean.

For now, doctors say the baby has a normal heartbeat, though it remains unknown how it was affected when Marlise’s brain was deprived of oxygen.

‘They don't know how long the baby was without nutrients and oxygen,’ Erick told ABC. ‘But I'm aware what challenges I might face ahead.’

Munoz says that, though he doesn’t agree with the law, he’s not interested in fighting a protracted legal battle.

'It's hard to reach the point where you wish your wife's body would stop,' he said.

'They don't know how long the baby was without nutrients and oxygen,' Erick said

Normal heartbeat: For now, the baby in Marlise's womb has a normal heartbeat and could still potentially be carried to full term

'I'm aware what challenges I might face ahead': Though he doesn't agree with the laws, Erick says he's not interested in engaging in a long pro-life vs. pro-choice battle

Erick Munoz of Fort Wort, Texas found his wife Marlise unconscious on the kitchen floor on November 26

@highlight

Marlise was 14 weeks pregnant at the time, too early in the pregnancy for the baby to survive outside the mother

@highlight

She remains on life support because Texas law forbids any action that would harm an unborn child in such cases

'I don't agree with this law': Erick says he and his wife, who are both paramedics, long ago agreed they wouldn't want to remain on life support
