Tough line: The Prime Minister is preparing to take proposals for reform to a European summit in an attempt to renegotiate the relationship with Brussels ahead of a referendum

David Cameron will this week demand the return of powers from Brussels amid new evidence of the massive cost of EU regulation to Britain.

A report published today by the Open Europe think-tank claims that the top 100 EU regulations are costing the UK more than £27billion a year, outweighing benefits in a quarter of cases.

The Prime Minister is preparing  to take proposals for reform to a European summit in what is seen as the first stage of attempts to renegotiate the relationship with Brussels ahead of a referendum.

EU leaders are meeting to discuss ways to improve growth and competitiveness.

Open Europe is publishing a list of the 100 most costly EU regulations to the UK economy using Government data.

It concludes they cost the economy £27.4billion a year – more than the expected revenue from council tax. In at least 24 cases, the Government’s own impact assessment finds estimated costs outweigh the estimated benefits.

The rules include a ‘temporary agency workers directive’, giving temporary staff more employment rights, and an ‘energy performance of buildings directive’, which requires all properties sold, built or rented to have an Energy Performance Certificate.

Benefits are also said to be vastly over-stated and in the case of the flagship climate change regulations, Open Europe estimates that 95 per cent of envisaged benefits have failed to materialise.

Difficult balance: EU diktats cost the UK £27bn a year including £4.5bn for banking rules, £3.4bn climate and energy legislation and £4.1bn for the Working Time Directive

Analyst Vincenzo Scarpetta said: ‘It is hard to understand how policymakers can knowingly impose costs on the economy that outweigh the stated benefits of regulation.’

Annual figures for the five costliest EU regulations are capital rules for banks at £4.5billion; the Working Time Directive, £4.1billion; the EU Climate and Energy Package, £3.4billion; the Temporary Agency Workers Directive, £2billion; and the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, £1.5billion.

Business leaders have also condemned rules on working hours and the hiring of agency workers, environmental and food labelling and plans to require 20 weeks’ maternity leave on full pay.
