PETA claims to be the world's leading animal rights charity - but this shocking picture of garbage bags filled with dead cats has led to claims that the group is actually abusing animals rather than helping them.

The photograph shows the interior of a dumpster outside a North Carolina supermarket, which reportedly contains a pile of garbage bags each filled with the dead cats.

The picture is one of many photos that Nathan Winograd claims depict rampant animal abuse at the organization that took the felines in with the promise of finding them homes.

Bloodshed: Piles of garbage bags containing dead cats are pictured outside PETA's Virginia headquarters

The photo was taken in 2007, when two PETA employees were charged with animal cruelty in connection to the dead cats, according to the Roanoke-Chowan News-Herald.

Veterinarians testified in the case that the cats found in the bags were found to be healthy before their deaths.

In another photo provided by Mr Winograd, a 'pet-killing kit' that was found in the back of a PETA van is seen.

Mr Winograd, the director of the No Kill 
Advocacy Center, says that images such as this exhibit the horrific reality of pets that enter PETA's doors - and don't make it out.

He claims that PETA has killed more than 29,426 animals in
 the last 11 years.

Winograd branded the animal rights group 'little more than a slaughterhouse' in a February blog post.

Saddening: More than 1,0000 cats were euthanized by PETA last year, according to statistics from the Virginia Department for Agriculture and Consumer Services

In an emailed statement, PETA spokesman Ben Williamson said: 'Anyone who is shocked to learn how many animals have to be euthanized annually in the U.S. should ask themselves if they're spaying and neutering their own companion animals, adopting from shelters instead of buying from breeders and pet stores and demanding higher animal-care standards in their own communities. And more importantly, they should look at the photos of animals PETA U.S. served in the impoverished areas in the vicinity of its headquarters in Virginia.'

Mr Williamson added that the euthanasia figures are distorted, and do not include the almost 10,000 dogs
 and cats PETA provided with no-cost to low-cost sterilization 
services, the number of animals delivered to large high-traffic 
facilities for adoption, as well as counseling and preventive services.

The organization has released a video of its own that examines the danger of no-kill shelters, which Williamson says turn away animals due to overcrowding.

Euthanasia: This 'pet killing kit' was found by police officers in the back of a PETA van, according to Winograd

PETA told MailOnline last month that the animals they take in at the center are 'unadoptable.'

In figures from the Virginia Department for Agriculture and Consumer Services last month, it was revealed that PETA killed nearly 90 per cent of dogs and cats placed in the care of the shelter at its headquarters last year.

The charity, well-known for attention grabbing publicity campaigns such as the 'I'd rather go naked' anti-fur campaign, euthanized 1,647 cats and dogs last year and only placed 19 in new homes according to data submitted to the Virginia Department for Agriculture and Consumer Services.

However, the figure that 89.4 per cent of euthanized animals is much higher than their own approximation that half of pets taken to shelters end up being killed. 

According to the statistics 1,110 cats and 733 dogs were handed in to the charity in 2012.

22
 cats and 108 dogs were transferred to another shelter, two cats and 
three dogs were reclaimed by their owner while 1,045 cats and 602 dogs were 
euthanized.

Criticism: PETA, well-known for its hard-hitting adverts such as the one pictured, has come under fire for the number of animals it kills at its shelter in Norfolk, Virginia

Defense: The charity says euthanasia at its Virginia HQ shelter, pictured, is a 'necessary evil' as aside from those suffering they can't find homes for all the cats and dogs handed to them

34 cats and 7 dogs were placed under a category entitled 'Miscellaneous.'

The statistics have been promoted by a restaurant advocacy coalition called Center for Consumer Freedom, which has had numerous run-ins with the charity in the past.  

Justin Wilson, CCF's senior research analyst said: 'The animal rights group is talking out of both sides of its mouth – on one side preaching its animal liberation agenda, while on the other signing the death warrant of over 89 percent of pets in its care. It’s beyond hypocritical.'

'It seems PETA is more dedicated to 
publicity stunts than to keeping the animals in its own care alive. It’s
 the height of hypocrisy for PETA to demonstrate for the 'rights' of 
rats and pigs, while killing tens of thousands of pets. It’s time that 
the Commonwealth of Virginia finally reclassifies PETA’s pet shelter for
 what it is – a slaughterhouse.'

A PETA spokeswoman told MailOnline that they had no choice but to euthanize the animals.

Well-known campaigns: The charity often uses celebrities for its hard-hitting campaigns. It was accused today of being more interested in 'publicity stunts than keeping animals alive'

Campaigns: Among its many projects PETA encourages vegetarianism and veganism and is against animal testing

'We
 have a small division that does hands-on work with animals, and most of
 the animals we take in are society's rejects; aggressive, on death's 
door, or somehow unadoptable,' she said.

'CCF's goal is to damage PETA by misrepresenting the situation and the number of unwanted and suffering animals PETA euthanizes because of injury, illness, age, aggression, and other problems, because their guardians requested it, or because no good homes exist for them.'

A later statement added: 'PETA
 refers adoptable animals to the high-traffic open-admission shelters 
where they have the best chance of being seen and finding a new home.'

In a 2009 blog
 the charity wrote about their opposition to 'no-kill' animal shelters 
saying they often get filled and just have to turn animals away.

It said in some cases euthanasia is a necessary evil and PETA is willing to do 'society's dirty work.'

Sex sells: PETA often uses models in their campaigns. They hit out at critics of euthanasia at their cat and dog shelters yesterday saying it received many unadoptable pets

'As long as animals are still purposely bred and people aren't spaying and neutering their companions, open-admission animal shelters and organizations like PETA must do society's dirty work. Euthanasia is not a solution to overpopulation but rather a tragic necessity given the present crisis,' it said.  

In response to the post, supporters of the charity were torn on the issue but many said a charity in its position on issues such as medical testing, the fur trade and as advocates for veganism should never allow the killing of healthy animals over a lack of suitable home.   

'In my book, the only time it's acceptable to kill animals is the same as the only time it's acceptable to kill people: when their illness is painful and terminal.'

'Anything else is a speciesist double standard. As soon as I hear of a campaign to kill homeless people because it's 'more humane' then I might consider it an acceptable option for homeless animals too,' said one post.
