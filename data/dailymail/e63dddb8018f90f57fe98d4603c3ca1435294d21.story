The funeral has been held for an 11-year-old cancer patient who helped to inspire do-gooders and feed dozens in the process.

Natalia Marsh-Welton from Cincinnati was battling a brain tumor for more than a year, but her one wish was to help feed those less fortunate than herself.

'We were watching Food Network and she was like, 'hey mom' and I was like 'yeah' and she was like 'I've got it can we feed the hungry?'' said Natalia's mother, Kelly Marsh-Welton.

Special girl: Natalia, 11, used her wish from the Make-A-Wish Foundation to give out blankets and soup to the homeless at the Drop Inn Center in Cincinatti

Selfless: Natalia, who was fighting an inoperable brain tumor, died last month

Still going: To date Natalia collected more than 600 blankets and even found the strength to head back to the Drop Inn Center for her birthday in October

Helping out: Donations are still pouring in and Natalia’s family plans to visit a homeless shelter soon to give back

The Make-A-Wish Foundation arranged for the  girl to team up with a world-class chef, and together they created the recipe for Natalia's Soup of Love.

She then helped deliver batches of it to a local homeless shelter.

The little girl, who passed away last month, struggled through chemotherapy. 

She was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor in September of 2013 with a rare and very aggressive brain tumor, described as a high grade bithalamic glioma.

Living without: 'I know everybody misses her because of all the good things she has done when she was still alive,' Natalia's younger brother Malakye Marsh-Welton said

Doctors concluded that because of where the tumor was located, it was inoperable. 

Natalia fought the cancer with radiation and multiple types of chemotherapy until inevitably conventional medicine ran out of options.

One of the side effects of the treatment was that she found it very difficult to stay warm. 

Natalia's wish was for the homeless to have a blanket and a cup of soup.

'I want to make soup for the homeless because I was remembering how cold I was,' Natalia said. 'I hope my wish is a success.'  

Volunteers met Natalia at a drop-in center  to hand out soup and blankets.

Natalia also got help from Panera Bread, which donated bread bowls in which soup was served. Close to 500 blankets were also donated.

Her wish was unusual because often the organization helps people meet their idols or experience something unique, however Natalia simply wanted to give back to the community. 

Mommy's girl: “I hope that people use her as an inspiration. Maybe it won't be soup and blankets, maybe it will be care packages for soldiers or toys for kids,” Kelly Marsh-Welton said

Queen of hearts: The Make-A-Wish Foundation arranged for the 10-year-old girl from Cincinnati to team up with a world-class chef, and together they created the recipe for Natalia's Soup of Love

Thoughtful: Natalia struggled through chemotherapy and could never stay warm, which is one of the side effects. She wanted the homeless to have a blanket and a cup of soup

'To have a kid at that age that's so full of love for other people, she gets excited about helping and volunteering. That's all a mom can really ask for,' mom Kelly said. 

'I know everybody misses her because of all the good things she has done when she was still alive,' Natalia's younger brother Malakye Marsh-Welton said to WLWT.

Natalia collected more than 600 blankets and returned back to the homeless shelter for her brithday in October. 

Looking after Natalia has meant the family's finances have suffered and their credit  cards are maxed out.

The family are hoping that they may be able to continue to raise donations in memory of their daughter. http://www.gofundme.com/SupportNatalia 

'Though she has left this earth I assure you that she lives in the hearts and minds of all who love her and the thousands of people she's touched,' the family said in a statement.

'Our family appreciates all of the kind words and generous donations.'

We'll miss you: Her mom and brother give Natalia a big hug and kiss. The family appear lost without her
