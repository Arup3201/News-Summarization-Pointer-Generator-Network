A drunk driver caused a gruesome car crash that took the life of his passenger who was celebrating his birthday on Friday night.

Hugue Lapomarade, 31, was killed when driver Vladimir JeanPierre smashed his white minivan into a parked flatbed truck in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, in the early hours of Saturday morning.

JeanPierre, 34, has been arrested and charged with manslaughter, reckless endangerment, vehicular manslaughter and drunk driving. Emergency crews had to cut the roof and doors off the vehicle to remove the people inside.

Tragedy: The victim was removed from the car and taken to hospital, but was pronounced dead on arrival

The victim had been out celebrating his birthday before the horrific crash, which occurred at around 4.25 am on Saturday at 1304 Utica Avenue, East Flatbush.

Barry Radow, who works at a local garage told the New York Daily News that police had told him the driver 'hit the tow truck so hard he pushed the truck forward five or six feet.'

Wreckage: According to a witness, the car was driving so fast it moved the truck several feet

Horror: The car's roof had to be taken off to remove the driver and passenger after it hit a flatbed truck

Radow said: 'The car was a mess, they had to cut the roof off. It was really bad.'

Emergency workers arrived at the scene and rushed Lapomarade to hospital, but he was pronounced dead on arrival.

Police said it was not clear if the truck operator was at fault. The flatbed appeared to be double-parked when the white minivan, a white Nissan Quest, hit it.

The truck had been double parked, but police said it was not clear if there was any blame to lay on its owner
