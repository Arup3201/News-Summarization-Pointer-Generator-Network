Former Premier League footballer Jimmy Bullard has touched down on Australian soil ahead of his appearance on ITV reality show 'I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!'

Snapped by photographers as he left the airport with his luggage, Bullard was in high spirits ahead of his latest television appearance.

He will be joined in the jungle by former Superbike champion Carl Fogarty, as well as Irish lingerie model Nadia Forde, who is rumoured to be the ex-girlfriend of World Number One golfer Rory McIlroy.

His most famous celebration came in the form of a mock team-talk he gave his Hull team-mates in 2009

Bullard has raced to the top of the popularity stakes ahead of the show's launch on Sunday, and is 2/1 favourite with bookmakers Coral. 

Other celebrities taking part include TOWIE's Gemma Collins, rapper Tinchy Stryder and actor Craig Charles.

Bullard had a stop-start footballing career, suffering from a number of serious injuries throughout. Despite this, he was always prominent in the dressing room, widely acknowledged as the joker in the pack.

ITV bosses will be hopeful of pranks aplenty from the ex-footballer while he is in the jungle, and Bullard follows on from a host of ex-sportsmen and women who have appeared on the show.

Perhaps his most famous celebration came in the form of a dressing-down he gave his Hull team-mates at the Etihad in November 2009.

After scoring a penalty for the Tigers, Bullard grouped his fellow players into a circle, before recreating an on-the-pitch team-talk that manager Phil Brown had dished out previously.

Forde was reportedly dating World Number One golfer Rory McIlroy, but they have now split
