Row: Number 10 Downing Street and David Cameron were allegedly told in advance that David Miranda would be held at Heathrow

David Cameron was today pulled into the row over the detention of the partner of a Guardian journalist after it emerged Downing Street had advance warning of the operation.

The Prime Minister was reportedly told David Miranda would be stopped at Heathrow Airport on Sunday because he was allegedly carrying 'highly sensitive stolen information that would help terrorism'.

Mr Miranda's partner Glenn
 Greenwald is the Guardian journalist who reported on America's internet
 spying programmes which were exposed by the fugitive whistleblower 
Edward Snowden.

He was stopped under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 as he changed planes 
on a journey from Berlin to his home in Brazil.

A Downing Street source said Number 10 
was 'kept abreast of the operation ' to detain David Miranda, but denied
 any political involvement in the decision, adding: 'The Government does
 not direct police investigations.'

The Home Secretary was also 
briefed prior to the nine-hour detention, while the White House has also
 admitted that President Barrack Obama was also given a 'heads up', it 
was revealed.

But Theresa May said that it was not for her to tell the police who they should or should not stop at ports, or who they should arrest.

She said:'I was briefed in advance that there was a possibility of a port stop of the sort that took place.

'If it is believed that somebody has in their possession highly sensitive stolen information which could help terrorists, which could lead to a loss of lives, then it is right that the police act and that is what the law enables them to do.

'But we live in a country where those decisions as to whether to stop somebody or arrest somebody are not for me as Home Secretary, they are for the police to take, that's absolutely right that they have their operational independence and long may that continue.'

The 28-year-old Brazilian has now launched a challenge over the police's legal basis for holding him and taking his property.

Schedule 7 applies only at airports, ports and border areas, allowing officers to stop, search, question and detain individuals.

Mr Miranda claimed he was held for nine hours by agents who questioned him about his 'entire life' and took his 'computer, video game, mobile phone, my memory card - everything'.

The Guardian has admitted he had been carrying 'journalistic materials' and they paid for his flights, but said he was not employed by them.

While in Berlin Mr Miranda stayed 
withe American film-maker Laura Poitras, who has apparently been helping
 the Guardian get through the Snowden documents.

The
 use of this terror law has been criticised by Mr Greenwald - the 
reporter who interviewed American whistleblower Edward Snowden - as a 
'profound attack on press freedoms and the news-gathering process', and 
has sparked widespread debate on the use of terror laws.

A Guardian News & Media spokesman today said the Guardian is 'supportive' of Mr Miranda's claim.

The
 newspaper's editor Alan Rusbridger told the BBC: 'We will have to work 
out if that is legal or not, and that will be subject to legal 
challenge, I believe, by Glenn Greenwald and David Miranda because it's 
not clear that he was actually committing any offence in carrying 
material through Heathrow.

'I'm not aware of what that offence is.'

He
 went on: 'I think there will be a legal challenge to the use of this 
very controversial bit, this Schedule 7, of the Terrorism Act and its 
use to obtain journalistic material.

'A
 lot of journalists the world over fly through Heathrow and I think some
 of them now are going to be quite anxious about how the British 
authorities regard this bit of Britain that is not quite Britain but is 
Britain.'

Schedule
 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 allows police officers to stop, search, 
question and detain individuals travelling through a port, airport or 
border area.

It is to 
determine whether that person is or has been involved in the commission,
 preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.

Stopping
 an individual does not necessarily mean that the officer believes the 
person is a terrorist - in fact, it does not require any reasonable 
suspicion that they might be one.

Detention
 is permitted for up to nine hours before an arrest or release must be 
made. But last month the Government said the maximum detention period 
would be lowered to six hours.

An
 examining officer may require a person to answer questions or provide 
certain documents - and failure to do so may be considered an offence 
under the Act.

The Home Office 
has defended the decision to detain David Miranda under terrorism laws, 
saying the Government and police 'have a duty to protect the public and 
our national security'.

Scotland
 Yard has defended the use of the Terrorism Act to detain Mr Miranda as 
he changed planes on a journey from Berlin to his home in Brazil as 
'legally and procedurally sound'.

And
 the Home Office appeared to back the decision as a spokesman said: 'The
 Government and the police have a duty to protect the public and our 
national security.

'If 
the police believe that an individual is in possession of highly 
sensitive stolen information that would help terrorism, then they should
 act and the law provides them with a framework to do that.

'Those who oppose this sort of action need to think about what they are condoning.

'This is an ongoing police inquiry so we will not comment on the specifics.'

Mr Rusbridger has also revealed that 'shadowy' Government figures were sent in to destroy hard drives owned by the newspaper.

In
 a comment piece in the paper, he said he held a series of meetings in 
which he was asked to destroy all Edward Snowden-related material.

According
 to the Guardian Downing Street sources allege that David Cameron had 
approved to attempt to get the data because he feared that the 
newspaper's computers could be hacked and the information used by 
terrorists or other enemies of the state.
