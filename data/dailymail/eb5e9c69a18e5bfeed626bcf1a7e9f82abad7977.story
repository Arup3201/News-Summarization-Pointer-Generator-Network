When Manny Pacquiao promised to come out swinging against Floyd Mayweather Jnr, this probably wasn't what he had in mind.

The Filipino star looked relaxed as he took his mind off his upcoming $300million (£200m) mega-fight with a trip to the playground.

Earlier on Wednesday, Pacquiao had completed the 15th day of his training camp with little more than six weeks until he faces Mayweather in Las Vegas on May 2.

The day before, the 36-year-old sparred for the first time with partners Edis Tatli and Kenneth Sims Jnr, completing a total of five rounds.

Tatil, a Finnish lightweight, has lost just once in 25 fights while Sims has fought just five times but his style has been likened to Mayweather's.

'After 13 days of strength and conditioning and boxing drills at Wild Card plus weeks more of working out in the Philippines in February, it was great to finally put on the headgear and spar,' Pacquiao said.

Mayweather also worked the heavy bag and tweeted that his training was 'easy work'

'My sparring partners gave me good work today. They were perfect for testing the strategy Freddie and I have developed to beat Floyd Mayweather. I was very happy with my stamina and speed today.'

Trainer Freddie Roach, meanwhile, said he was impressed with what he had seen. 

'Manny looked so fresh today. I'm very happy with what he showed me,' he said. 'You couldn't tell he had been away from the ring since the Algieri fight in November. Manny is on fire in the gym.'

Mayweather on the other hand, was sticking to more tried and tested training methods as he continued to work on the pads.

The 38-year-old seemed to be enjoying himself, tweeting 'Easy work' after his session.
