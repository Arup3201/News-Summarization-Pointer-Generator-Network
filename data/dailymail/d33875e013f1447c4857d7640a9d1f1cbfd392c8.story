As the National Football League continues to deal with the fallout of the Richie Incognito/Jonathan Martin bullying scandal, a former player has revealed that he, too, was the victim of harassment from teammates as a professional football player - and former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb led the charge.

Former NFL offensive lineman Shawn Andrews was teammates with McNabb for six years in Philadelphia - from 2004 to 2009 - and by the end of his time in the City of Brotherly Love, he'd considered suicide after enduring unsubstantiated rumors about his sexuality and constant harassment from McNabb and others.

Andrews currently is married to a woman and has a son, J.J.

'Bullied': Shawn Andrews says he contemplated suicide after relentless harassment from teammate Donovan McNabb

The harassment was so bad that Andrews was forced to miss training camp before the 2008 season so he could get professional help to deal with depression.

'[McNabb] was a big part of it — he was a big part of my issues there. Bully is a strong word, but he was degrading to me and spread rumors. It’s bothered me that I haven’t really spoken about it,' Andrews told syncweekly.com.

Andrews says he doesn't understand why McNabb turned against him - after all, as an offensive lineman, it was Andrews' job to protect the former Syracuse star from linebackers looking to take his head off.

Andrews isn't sure why he was made to be a target, but says it could have to do with a variety of factors - the way he wore his hair (a mohawk often dyed red or white) or the Vans sneakers he wore, could have contributed to other players' opinion of him.

'Some guys, they just find one thing and run with it,' his brother Stacy Andrews - also a former NFL lineman - says. 'Us having a little style and swag, they just ran with that. Big guys don’t usually wear Vans shoes, but we do. They made some comments and snickered about that. They may not like it that you dress a little different.'

'Center of attention': Andrews comes short of calling McNabb a bully, but says he was certainly no leader

Whatever the reason, the relentless harassment drove Andrews to consider suicide.

'One time I had a crazy idea of flipping my car. I knew I didn’t want to kill myself because I wouldn’t use a gun. I was a coward in that regard. Because if I flip my vehicle and I’m paralyzed and I live ... that’s the kind of stuff that went through my head,' Andrews says. 'I was kind of at my wit’s end, but I was still afraid to talk to somebody. The very first person I opened up to was a paid psychiatrist. It was hard to do.'

After missing training camp, Andrews asked coach Andy Reid if he could address the team as a whole and apologize for his absence.

'I poured my heart out. I’m not a public speaker, so I was nervous,' 
Andrews says. 'But I felt it had to be done, so I was standing there 
talking, and in the middle of talking to them I was making eye contact 
with as many of the [players] as I could. So guess who was looking at me
rolling his eyeballs? Can you guess who was doing that while I was 
pouring my heart out to my teammates? You know how that made me feel? 
After that, my thoughts were so screwed up. Then I started to stutter 
and thought, ‘'These guys probably think I’m full of sh*t.’' At that point
I really cared. [McNabb] was rolling his eyes at me the whole time.'

'A living hell': Andrews says the Eagles locker room had little comradery and was full of immature players

Andrews describes the atmosphere in the Eagles locker room as 'cliquey,' with McNabb always needing to be the center of attention.

'I could be sitting in the players’ lounge with a group, having some laughs, and he’d get his say in so the attention can shift,' Andrews says. 'He was the type of person that had everything in the world he could want, but that still wasn’t enough. He wanted the attention on him. There was a whole lot of that behavior. He wasn’t just that way with me. I’m thinking, ''‘Every day I strap on my shoulder pads and helmet, I’m here to protect you.’''

Andrews also attributes the immaturity of other players to the rumors regarding his sexuality. He says he has nothing against homosexuals, but that being labeled one in the NFL is dangerous. He says that after he caught wind of the rumors, he would wait until other players were out of the shower before he would go in, as to make sure other players didn't think he was there to look at them.

'If you want to question someone, I’d see guys in the shower talking face to face,' Andrews says. 'If you want to go further, I’ve even seen a teammate piss on another teammate. They think it’s funny. They are having a conversation and the whole time one guy is peeing on him and the other doesn’t even know. This is the stuff that goes on, and I am the one having to defend myself. There were a lot of immature dudes on the team.'

After a series of injuries, Andrews was released by the Eagles. He was picked up by the New York Giants and had a much better experience with quarterback Eli Manning.

'We were in the weight room the day after a game, stretching, and Eli came up to me and said, '‘Shawn, thanks for protecting me,’” Andrews said. 'That never happened in Philadelphia. I had heard that Tom Brady bought his linemen Mercedes. That ‘'thank you'’ was my Mercedes. That meant a lot to me, but the entire organization was like that.

'I had the time of my life in New York. I just wished I could have played a few more seasons there.'
