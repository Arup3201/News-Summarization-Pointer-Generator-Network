Detectives investigating the abduction and alleged murder of April Jones are probing claims a van driver tried to snatch a schoolboy 75 miles from where the five-year-old was taken.

The boy, nine, escaped after he was grabbed by the white van driver just before 9am as he walked to school, in the village of Llandybie in West Wales, yesterday.

The child freed himself and ran home to his family unharmed. The case is not linked
to April's disappearance three weeks ago.

Alleged abduction: A man allegedly got out of his van at just before 9am in the village of Llandybie in West Wales, (pictured) to grab the schoolboy by the arm but he managed to escape

Witnesses have been told to call Dyfed Powys police if they had any information about who the man was.

It is the third abduction the force 
is investigating in two months.

In September, two weeks before April was snatched from Machynlleth, the
force revealed it had a report of another attempted abduction near the Mid Wales town.

Investigation: Dyfed Powys Police are investigation the alleged abduction - the force is also investigating the abduction of April Jones, five, who disappeared earlier this month. Her body has not been found

It is understood that a boy had been the
victim of that incident, but had escaped unhurt.

April disappeared three weeks ago after playing with her friends at around 7pm.

Police are still searching for her body and Mark Bridger, 46, has been charged with her abduction and murder.

A spokeswoman for Dyfed Powys Police said of the latest attempted abduction: 'Police are investigating a suspicious incident that occurred just before 9am in Llandybie, Ammanford.

'A nine year-old-boy, walking to school 
along Woodfield Road, has reported that what is described as a small 
white van has stopped by him, a man has got out and grabbed his arm.

'The boy ran home immediately. There is no description of the man at the current time.

'Anyone who witnessed the incident is asked to contact police on 101 immediately.'
