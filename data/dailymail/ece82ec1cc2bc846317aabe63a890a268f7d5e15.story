The families of rival captains Wayne Rooney and Darren Fletcher will watch Tuesday's Scotland-England clash at Celtic Park together.

Rooney and Fletcher, good friends and the captain and vice-captain of Manchester United, have jointly-hired a box for their families to share for the game in Glasgow.

It will be the first time the two countries have met in Scotland since 1999 when England won the first leg of a Euro 2000 play-off 2-0 with a brace from Paul Scholes.

Rooney said: 'I can't wait, I think it will be a great game. It will be a fantastic atmosphere. I'm actually glad it's at Celtic Park. It will be even more special there and it's game I've been looking forward to it since the fixture was made.

'I have had some interesting ones with Fletch about the game! We are close anyway and it will be nice to play against him at international level. We have a box for his family and my family.

'I'm sure the atmosphere will be incredible. With the history with England and Scotland - I grew up with David Moyes and Alex Ferguson as managers - so this is certainly one I want to win.'

'It won't be a friendly. You have some games with England, when they're friendlies, and they're games you know you should win. I always remember one of the most competitive games I've played for England out of all my games was Argentina in Switzerland. It was really competitive, and against Scotland it won't be like a friendly game.'

Rooney has been to Celtic as a fan cheering on his former Everton team-mate Alan Stubbs and also experienced the Parkhead roar as a Manchester United player when they were beaten there in the Champions League.

And he wants his England team-mates to try and stay ice-cool on Tuesday.

'We have to make sure we don't get drawn into it being a battle. We have to make sure we play our football and try and outplay them, rather than out-fight them,' he said.

'I have played there a few times and it's an unbelievable atmosphere.We want to win. It's bragging rights for everyone.'

England manager Roy Hodgson will allow some players to leave the squad ahead of Tuesday's match but Rooney is adamant he will not be one of them as he closes in on Peter Shilton and Sir Bobby Charlton's international appearance and goalscoring records.
