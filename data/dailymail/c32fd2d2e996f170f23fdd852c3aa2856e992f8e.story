Elephants in the South African bush are being trained to use their super-strength sense of smell to sniff out explosives and poachers.

The project, supported by the U.S. Army Research Office, was inspired after elephants in Angola were observed using their trunks to help them avoid areas full of land mines left over from decades of civil war.

Sean Hensman, operator of Adventures with Elephants game ranch in South Africa, said: 'An elephant's nose is amazing. Think about mammoths, which had to find food through the ice.'

During  tests, a 17-year-old male elephant named Chishuru was  walked past a row of buckets- once of which would have a swab laced with TNT scent stapled to the bottom of one.

Sticking his trunk into each bucket, he was taught to stop and raise a front leg when he came across the one with the swab. He got the bucket right each time.

And like a sniffer dog, he was rewarded with his favourite treat: the marula fruit.  

U.S. army researchers, who have been involved in the project for five years, say there will be no elephants on the field but robotic drones could collect material for them to test.

'We could bring scents from the field collected by unmanned robotic systems to the elephants for evaluation,' added Stephen Lee, chief scientist of the U.S. Army Research Office.

Despite their super-strength senses of smell, the jury is still out on who has the better nose: dogs or elephants. 

But Mr Lee did say there was some truth in the old adage that an elephant never forgets.

'Dogs require constant training while the elephants seem to understand and remember the scent without the need for constant training,' he said.

Mr Hensman had previously trained a dozen elephants for anti-poaching patrols in Zimbabwe. 

After his family lost their three farms to President Robert Mugabe's land seizures in 2002, he moved to South Africa to continue his work.

They won't be used in  field but will test scents brought by robotic drones
