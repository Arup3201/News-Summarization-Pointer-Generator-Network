In joint first place are Doutzen Kroes and Adriana Lima, who each raked in $8m in earnings this year and came joint second on Forbes list of top-earning models. Only Gisele Bundchen out-earned them with her $47m paycheck.

Instead the Dutch beauty has built her career around having curves and is now a top player in the industry.
