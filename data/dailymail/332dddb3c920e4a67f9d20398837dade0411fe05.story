Veteran journalist Michael Usher and his crew were kept in isolation at Sydney Airport on Thursday, after flying in from Sierra Leone where they had spent a week filming a story on the Ebola virus.

The five-member reporting team from 60 Minutes was detained inside the Kingsford Smith terminal at Mascot early on Thursday morning, after heading back from the assignment.

The group, including reporter Usher, was on its way home from the west African country after spending several days interviewing workers and filming a story about the Ebola crisis, in which they visited several areas crippled by the virus.

A Nine spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that they were 'being held in an isolated room while Customs and Quarantine officers undertake screening procedures'.

It's understood that a medical team from the NSW Department of Health was called to the airport, to assess the 60 Minutes staff members.

A Customs official confirmed the process: 'With the Ebola procedures, Customs do the initial checks on those who have been travelling in that area, and then refer them to quarantine officials and then State health personnel are brought in.'

According to the network, they all had their temperatures taken and have returned normal readings.

The five staff members were released just after midday, after receiving the all-clear by the Department of Health. In some circumstances, those who have been detained are required to undertake follow-up testing at home.

It's unclear when Michael Usher and the rest of the 60 Minutes Australia crew will be released from isolation at Sydney Airport following an Ebola alert by officials there

Under new government provisions, introduced soon after the Ebola crisis took hold in west Africa, every passenger arriving in Australia is required to fill in a travel history card that is then reviewed by Customs. 

The Department of Agriculture is charged with the process of screening passengers.

They told Daily Mail Australia: 'Since August 2014, bio-security officers of the Department of Agriculture have been undertaking targeted screening and assessment of international passengers entering Australia from Ebola virus disease-affected countries.'

'As part of their normal duties, bio-security officers at Australia’s air and sea ports have always looked for signs of disease that can impact human health. This is part of our role in managing Australia’s bio-security.

'All travellers arriving in Australia at an international airports and those arriving on international cruise vessels need to fill in a Travel History Card which indentifies their travel to or from an Ebola virus affected country, within in the past 21 days.'

Officials said that travellers who are identified are then asked to answer a series of questions about their travel and movement history and have their temperature checked.

'If their temperature is above normal, or they are found to present a risk because of their travel history or movements, a medical practitioner will perform an additional health assessment. This assessment will occur before the traveller is able to leave the airport.'
