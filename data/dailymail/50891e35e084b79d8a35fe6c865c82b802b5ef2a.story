California Highway Patrol investigators believe a 29-year-old woman committed suicide on Friday by getting onto the freeway, driving in the wrong direction, and causing a deadly head-on collision.

Witnesses saw Trista Lynn Stier drive onto Route 67 near Lakeside that afternoon, where she started speeding south in the northbound lane and lined her Ford-150 up with the utility vehicle driven by father-of-two Douglas Menegos, 49.

'She got to the middle and squared up facing oncoming traffic and stayed in that position,' witness Patrick Vargas told NBC San Diego. 'That tells me that it was deliberate.'

The two trucks crashed head-on at high speed, killing both Stier and Menegos.

Fatal: Witnesses saw Stier drive onto Route 67, going south in the northbound lane before she lined up with Menegos' truck and crashed head-on. The two were later pronounced dead at the hospital

Another Ford F-450 was struck in the accident, but the 53-year-old male driver from El Cajon was not injured.

On Monday, the Medical Examiner's Office said they were investigating the crash as a homicide.

CHP Officer Kevin Pearlstein said Stier was 'just looking for the biggest truck you could find' to hit and that there was no indication that the two victims knew each other.

The CHP continues to investigate the crash.

Friends have described Mengos as a devoted family man. He leaves behind wife Lisa, 20-year-old daughter Kara and son Jacob, 17.

A GoFundMe account has been set up to raise money for Menegos' funeral expenses, with the leftover funds going to his children's college education.

As of Tuesday morning, the fund had surpassed it's goal of $20,000.
