Move aside Gordon Ramsay, there's a new head chef in town.

But Justin Bieber lookalike Luke Thomas isn't any old head chef. At just 19 years old, he is the UK's youngest and already has a cookery CV to rival that of Jamie Oliver.

The floppy-haired youngster from North Wales has trained alongside the likes of Heston Blumenthal and Gary 
Rhodes and worked at fine-dining celebrity hotspots such as The Fat Duck and 
the 7* Burj Al Arab in Dubai.

Watch out Jamie Oliver! Luke Thomas is the UK's youngest head chef at just 19-years-old

Luke, who is likely to become quite a hit with the ladies, began cooking at the tender age of 12 and now cooks up a storm every single day in his own restaurant between 7am and midnight.

And there's no stopping the ambitious chef, who is about to open the doors to a new pop-up restaurant.

Opening next month, Luke's new haunt will be set above Embassy in plush Mayfair, where Prince Harry regularly parties.

The pop-up restaurant, which will open its doors for just
six months, is in conjunction with famed hotelier Mark 
Fuller.

Head chef: Luke already runs Luke's Fine Dining at Sanctum on the Green, near Marlow in Berkshire, which will be the subject of a new TV documentary

Dishes likely to feature on the menu include his delicious signature dish: a curry with scallops, crispy mussels and mango.

Fuller is so confident about Luke's skills that he has dubbed him the new Marco Pierre White.

But Luke's true hero is popular TV chef Jamie Oliver.

Speaking to Hello! magazine he said: 'I'm a big fan of his.

'He gives people 
what they want, he cooks food that people can go away and cook at home, 
his restaurants are accessible.

'I need to follow this model because what he's done is create this empire which is so successful.'

And for those hoping to get a glimpse into Luke's culinary world, a new fly-on-the-wall documentary will follow his first year of his restaurant opening: Luke's Fine Dining at Sanctum on the Green, near Marlow in Berkshire.

Speaking about his foodie brainchild,
 he said: 'Although Luke's Dining Room is a little bit more refined in 
the sense of the food, I call it the mix between a gastro pub and a 
restaurant.

'It's not as casual as a gastro pub and not as formal as a restaurant, it's just got great food, great wine and great service.'

Watch out Jamie Oliver.
