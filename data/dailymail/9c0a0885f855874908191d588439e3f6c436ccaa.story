Father-of-one Christopher Foster was stabbed to death in a case of mistaken identity outside a pub in south London last year

An innocent father was stabbed to death outside a London pub after a gang targeted him by mistake in a revenge attack.

City porter Christopher Foster, 34, was stabbed in the back as he smoked a cigarette with a friend outside a pub in Borough High Street, south London on November 29 last year.

Mr Foster, who has a four-year-old daughter, suffered catastrophic internal injuries and died an hour after the attack at the St Christopher's Inn.  

The man who led the gang, Aytach Lisani, 33, has previously pleaded guilty to murdering the father-of-one and faces life behind bars.

Three more men - Rocky Djelal, 34, Billy Dove, 30, Ali Lisani, 38, of south east London - admitted conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm after murder charges against them were dropped mid-trial at the Old Bailey.

Two more defendants were cleared today of the GBH plot.

The court had heard Aytach Lisani had mistaken Mr Foster for another man, Harry Saunders, who was drinking in the same bar and had allegedly slashed the face of a friend, Aydin Salih, months earlier. 

Prosecutor David Fisher told the jury: 'On the evening of Friday November 29 last year Christopher Foster was standing with his friend Danny Murphy outside Saint Christopher's Inn on Borough High Street.

'They were having a last drink outside as were a number of people. The atmosphere in the alleyway was good but it was interrupted by a group of approximately seven men and a man named Aydin Salih.

'Faces obscured by hoods and scarves, their conduct was menacing, some were carrying bats and at least one knife.

'Christopher Foster had his back to the advancing group until at the last moment he turned.

'Danny Murphy believed there would be trouble but had no idea why. They decided to go back inside the pub but before they could do so Christopher Foster was stabbed once to the left side of his back, most probably from behind.

Guilty: Left, Aytach Lisani, who led the gang, previously admitted murdering Mr Foster and faces life behind bars, and right, Rocky Djelal, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to cause GBH part way through the trial

Left, Ali Lisani, and right, Billy Dove, also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit GBH after murder charges were dropped 

'Both men managed to enter the pub but Mr Foster had been seriously injured and collapsed.'

He died in hospital an hour and a half later.

The prosecutor told the jury: 'Christopher Foster had not said or done anything at all that could begin to explain why he was stabbed and you may conclude that he was wrongly believed by a number of these defendants to be a man called Harry Saunders who was in the same area as Mr Foster and had just weeks earlier apparently slashed the face of Aydin Salih.'

Salih was the cousin of Aytach Lisani, of south east London, and an associate of others in the group, the court heard.

Mr Fisher went on: 'This was therefore a revenge attack on a man believed to be Harry Saunders but who was in fact a totally innocent man and a stranger to most of the defendants, if not all of them.'

The attack stemmed from an incident on September 20 last year when Salih, who is in Cyprus, was treated at St Thomas's Hospital for a serious facial injury which needed stitches, the court heard.

But he refused to co-operate with police or substantiate the fact that he had been attacked.

Instead, phone records showed that he contacted Aytach Lisani who in turn phoned his brother Ali Lisani, jurors were told.

Meanwhile, Harry Saunders was in custody between October 9 and 25 last year, the court heard. 

But Ricky Huggins, 29, of south east London, and Mohmmed Aalamani, 28, of east London denied the offence and were cleared today.

Michael Gore, 55, and Joanna Stevens, 33, of south east London, were also found not guilty of perverting the course of justice.

The Old Bailey public gallery erupted in cheers as Huggins, a jobbing actor who had been due to appear as an extra in Our Kind of Traitor, starring Ewan McGregor, was cleared with property consultant Aalamani.

The actor had told the court: ‘It was nothing to do with me. I didn’t want to get involved.’

He admitted he was at the scene and was asked to see if he could spot Mr Saunders in the pub.

‘I didn’t know what he looked like so I knew I wouldn’t be able to see him,’ said Huggins.

He refused when he was asked to go into the pub and was crossing the road as the stabbing happened.

‘I didn’t know an attack was going to take place,’ Huggins insisted.

‘I wasn’t involved.’

Huggins said he was on his way home when he later saw the group chasing Mr Saunders, but did not know what was happening.

‘I was confused as to why people were running,’ he told the court.

Flowers were left at the scene in tribute to the father-of-one, who was targeted in a revenge attack gone wrong 

Aalamani also admitted he was at the scene but insisted he only realised an attack was planned when he heard the cry, ‘get him, get him, get him’.

He said he wanted to go to the police after the attack but was too frightened because murder suspect Aydin Salih, who is believed to be hiding in Cyprus, threatened to kill him.

He added that Salih was ‘pleading’ with him not to contact the police and said he wanted to speak to his solicitor.

‘I was adamant I was going to go to the police,’ he told the jury.

‘He was threatening me, he said don’t be a f*cking idiot and was threatening me.’

He added: ‘I was in an awkward position, I was in the worst position to be in.

‘I knew something but I couldn’t go to the police.

‘I was really scared, really scared.’

‘I was scared of anything that could happen from him, from his side, it could be his cousins or his friends.

‘Just because he is out of the way doesn’t mean that no one could get me.

‘I tried to do as much as I could.’

Aalamani denied he was being part of the gang who attacked Mr Foster.

Two other defendants, Joanna Stevens, 33, and Michael Gore, 54, were also cleared of helping Huggins and Aydin Salih escape from the scene.

Mr Foster worked for six years as a facilities assistant at international law firm Pinsent Masons.  

Sentencing will take place at the Old Bailey on a date to be fixed.
