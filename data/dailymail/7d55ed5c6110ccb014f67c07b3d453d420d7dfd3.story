Stefan Johansen insists there is no chance of Ronny Deila being broken by the strain of trying to lead Celtic to success in his first season as manager.

Deila’s side will try and take another step towards the knockout stage of the Europa League when they face Romanian outfit Astra Giurgiu at Parkhead on Thursday.

Progress in that competition would help make up for a double Champions League exit earlier in a season that has also seen Celtic toil for consistent Premiership form.

Saturday’s 5-0 rout of Ross County was a convincing response to a shock 1-0 home defeat from Hamilton, leaving Johansen hopeful that Deila’s reign is now ready for lift-off.

The two Norwegians previously worked together in their homeland, but Johansen believes his manager is growing in stature to meet the huge demands at Celtic which have troubled some of his predecessors.

‘He’s strong mentally and he believes in what he does,’ said Johansen. ‘I didn’t see that side of him at Stromsgodset because there wasn’t that pressure.

‘But now, when he has that pressure, he has handled it well. He hasn’t shown any weak points.

‘He hasn’t changed, he believes in the football he wants to play and I’m starting to see that get better.

‘Could the pressure and criticism break Ronny? No, I don’t think so.

‘As I said, he is strong mentally. He believes in what he does and, if he doesn’t succeed with that, he can be proud of trying.

‘But I’m sure he’s going to succeed, so that’s not going to happen.’

Asked if he felt Deila could have the same success in the role as Neil Lennon, Johansen added: ‘I think so — and Celtic know that, otherwise he wouldn’t be here.’

‘We lost against Hamilton and everyone was saying things were so bad but we’re still in both of the domestic cups.

‘We are doing well in the Europa League and hopefully we can win the next two games in the group and basically get through.

‘We want to win the league, so we need to keep picking up three points. We’re still in everything and aiming to get the best results.’

Meanwhile, Celtic winger James Forrest could be in line for a comeback tomorrow night.

The Scotland international has been out of action since injuring his hamstring in a substitute appearance against Dundee United in August.

Forrest had made only one previous start under new manager Deila as his fitness jinx continued.

It is understood, however, that the 23-year-old has been progressing well in training recently.

Deila remains keen to ease him back into action carefully but he could now be considered for a place in the squad against the Romanians.
