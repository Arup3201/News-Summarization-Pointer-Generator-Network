Diego Maradona wants Interpol to arrest an ex-girlfriend he claims stole jewellery from him when he kicked her out of his home.

The soccer star says he has asked a judge in Dubai, where he now lives, to order Rocio Oliva's detention so she can be extradited to the Gulf state for questioning.

Maradona, 53, launched legal proceedings for alleged theft against Rocio, 23, earlier this year after asking her to leave his Dubai mansion following an argument over Manchester United goalie David de Gea.

The retired footballer accused her of 
taking watches and jewellery worth more than £250,000 and then banned 
her from talking about him when she agreed to a kiss and tell on an 
Argentine TV show.

He told 
an Argentine TV presenter last night: 'I've waited for more than three 
months to see if she returned them and if the story changed.

'It didn’t change and so we’ve just signed the Interpol extradition request.

'The
 justice system in Dubai is very very tough. It’s true they cut your 
hand off. If you don’t return things, depending on the seriousness of 
the theft, you can do two to five years in prison.

'I don’t make the laws here, I didn’t rob anyone, I didn’t do anything wrong and I hope justice is done.'

Maradona,
 currently in Brazil to do World Cup commentary for an Argentine TV 
station, wrongly accused womens’ football player Rocio of flirting with 
de Gea after dropping in on the goalkeeper while they were doing winter 
training in Dubai in February.

 is said to have exploded with jealousy over disputed claims his then 
bride-to-be tried to swap Twitter and Facebook details with the Spanish 
keeper.

The soccer genius held a glitzy engagement party for Rocio in Rome on Valentine's Day - but put her on a plane to Buenos Aires days later when she reportedly threatened to embarrass him by signing up to a reality TV show after managing to put a lid on the de Gea row.

United keeper de Gea, unwittingly dragged into the dispute between Maradona and Oliva, insisted at the time he had never heard or met 'Mrs Maradona'.

Maradona started dating Rocio after dumping 37-year-old Ojeda when she was four and a half months pregnant with their child Diego Fernando, now one.

Maradona's volatile relationship with Rocio was the subject of constant scrutiny.

Passengers on board a packed plane bound for Argentina told last May how Maradona exchanged insults with Rocio during a heated row.

A politician's wife and air stewardesses are said to have had to step in to try to get him to calm down after Maradona allegedly grabbed his girlfriend by the neck.

Rocio, who has made no public comment after the latest claims, has denied any wrongdoing.
