A Royal Marine Commando has been jailed for attacking two women sex workers because he was angry with the service he received.

Nathan Bantick, 22, of Neath, South Wales, was caught on a massage parlour’s CCTV cameras assaulting the women on Christmas Day morning.

Swansea Crown Court heard Bantick became aggressive when he was told his 30-minute massage session, which cost £40, was over.

Guilty: Nathan Bantick, 22, from Neath, South Wales, standing outside Swansea Crown Court with an electronic cigarette. He pleaded guilty to assaulting two women sex workers and causing actual bodily harm to another customer

He shouted that he'd been 'ripped off' and showed the women, who worked at the massage parlour on Swansea high street, his military ID.

The court heard Bantick then told them: 'Who are the police going to want to believe - you or me?'

Bantick, who was jailed for 12 months at Swansea Crown Court, now faces being discharged from the Royal Navy for the 'uncontrollable attack'.

He pleaded guilty to assaulting Tammy Davie and Xhenia Thoncheva, admitting punching each woman in the head three times.

He also pleaded guilty to causing actual bodily harm to another customer, Jeremy Rees, who confronted Bantick about his behaviour.

The court heard Bantick punched and kneed Mr Rees 20 times. The victim was left with permanent nerve damage after the attack.

The court was told that Bantick and his 
brother Christopher were dressed in Santa hats when they visited the 
Park Lane massage parlour in Swansea at 3am after a night 
out together.

Prosecutor James Hartson said: 'Bantick paid for a 30-minute massage and when he was told his 30 minutes were over he became very agitated.

'He started shouting that he hadn’t received his full 30 minutes and said he’s been mugged off.

Aggressive: The Royal Marine commando attacked workers Tammy Davie and Xhenia Thoncheva and also dealt 20 blows to Jeremy Rees, another customer who tried to intervene

'He shouted aggressively and threatened to hit two masseuses if they didn’t give his money back.

'He punched the plaster board wall near the head of one of the women, grabbed her and pushed her against a wall.

'He took out his military ID saying: “Who do you think the police are going to want to believe, you or me?'

Swansea Crown Court heard how Mr Rees then confronted Bantick telling him: 'You can’t do that to women'.

Mr Hartson added: 'Bantick then launched a sustained attack punching and kneeing Mr Rees to the body. He dealt him 20 blows in total.'

The court heard Bantick also attacked the two women, punching each one of them around three times to the head.

Captured: Bantick was seen walking into the parlour on CCTV. After becoming angry, the Royal Marine commando took out his military ID and asked the women 'who the police would believe'

He was given his £40 back before kicking Mr Rees 'forcibly to the head'.

Bantick fled the parlour but was caught after police issued pictures of him from the CCTV system.

When interviewed by police he told them he’s been ripped off and had become angry when they refused a refund.

Bantick also admitted causing £875 damage to the massage parlour, which sits above an environmental company in the centre of Swansea.

Defence barrister Huw Rees-Davies said a prison sentence could mean Bantick is discharged from the Royal Navy. His senior officer was in court.

Judge Keith Thomas told him: 'This was a frightening display of aggression.

'You showed your military ID in order to threaten and bully - then you launched a sustained and uncontrollable attack.

'Out of spite and revenge you kicked Mr Rees in the head as he lay defenceless on the floor.'
