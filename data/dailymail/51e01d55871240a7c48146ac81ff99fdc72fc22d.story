Huddersfield Giants have signed half-back Jamie Ellis from Castleford Tigers on a two-year deal.

Ellis has made 14 league appearances for the Tigers this season, scoring two tries and kicking ten goals.

The 24-year-old told the club website: 'There is an opportunity to play at scrum-half, my favoured position.'

Ellis is the second Castleford player to sign for Huddersfield in recent weeks, following prop Craig Huby in moving to the John Smith's Stadium.

He continued: 'Obviously my place isn't guaranteed. I'm going to come here, train hard and hopefully get my chance.

'I know a few of the lads already at the Club. Brett Ferres was at Castleford and Craig Huby has also signed which will make it easier to bed into the squad. I just can't wait to get started.'

Huddersfield coach Paul Anderson said: 'Jamie will give us options. He is a very, very good young player.

'Jamie played more and more in a competitive Castleford side and proved his worth. He will add some depth to the halves position. We showed this year that when we had an injury in those positions we had to move people around and we struggled.

'Jamie also brings with him a good kicking game. When we lost Danny (Brough) to injury we knew we had nobody to kick the ball but Jamie can do that, he will become very important to us going forward.'

The club have also confirmed Jack Miller and Peter Aspinall have not been offered extended contracts and will not be part of the 2015 squad.

Elsewhere, Hull FC have handed promising winger Callum Lancaster a full-time contract until the end of 2017.

Lancaster, 17, made his Super League debut against Leeds Rhinos at Headingley in May and went on to score eight tries in his next four appearances, including consecutive hat-tricks against Widnes Vikings and Warrington Wolves.

Lancaster told the club website: 'Hopefully I will get a few more games next season.'
