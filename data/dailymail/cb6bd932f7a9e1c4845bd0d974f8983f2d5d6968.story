Ah, gummi bears. Ursus chewius. Those adorably retro penny sweets which children have enjoyed decapitating with their sharp little milk teeth since pick'n'mix began.

But now for something a little more sinister: the mega bear, a 2.3kg beast of sugar and gelatine that is 1,400 times the size of one of the normal little nine-calorie blighters and boasts an enormous 6,120 calories, more than three times the recommended daily intake for an active adult female.

The humongous monster comes in four flavours - cherry, orange, pink bubblegum and blue raspberry - and will set you back some £34.99 on novelty gift website Firebox... plus a small fortune in the ensuing dental bills.

The enormous beast of a jelly sweet costs £34.99 and will provide you with a toe-curling 6,120 calories

But if the prospect of shoving the whole gooey animal in your gaping maw without even coming up for air scares the life out of you, Firebox have considerately created a medium-sized version.

And, to make it even easier to nibble, lick or suck, they've put it on a stick.

Still a pretty intense sugar hit at 1,233 calories per piece (the equivalent of 137 normal gummi bears), the teddies are still ludicrously huge (11cm and 225g).

Ease yourself into the enormobear with this medium-sized beast on a stick, offering a moderate 1,233 calories per piece

And for those of you who find the idea of gobbling adorable little sugar bears just too much to, er, bear, how do you feel about gummi worms?

Less cute but still gargantuan, Firebox have created a wobbly stretch of wriggler that's 128 times bigger than a normal jelly earthworm... stuffed full of 4,000 calories.

Available in four different double flavour combinations - cherry/blue raspberry, cherry/green apple, cola/cherry and orange/blue raspberry - the £26.99 treat is a 26inch-long snake with a ribbed girth of five inches. Yum.

At 26inches long and with a girth of five inches, the giant gummi worm is not for the faint of heart

Of course, if you're looking to turn your children's tastebuds away from sweets and onto fmore nutritionally sound foodstuffs, the considerate gifting company are helpfully selling flaming hot evil habanero chilli gummi bears (normal-sized), that will confuse the little darlings so much they may swear themselves off sweet-shaped things forever.

The fiery blighters cost £4.99 per 250g pack and taste fruity with a chilli kick. They're almost as hot as the company's red hot chilli jellies, more designed for the mouth-burn enthusiast in your life.

Happy chewin'!

Could flaming habanero chilli gummi bears be the answer to turning your children off sweets forever?
