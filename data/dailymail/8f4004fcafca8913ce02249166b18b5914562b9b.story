Robert Streb earned his first PGA Tour win on Sunday by closing with a seven-under 63 and making a four-foot birdie putt on the second play-off hole in the McGladrey Classic.

The victory sends Streb to the Masters in April. The 27-year-old from Oklahoma has never played in a major.

He won a three-man playoff over Brendon de Jonge of Zimbabwe and Will MacKenzie. MacKenzie was eliminated on the first extra hole with a bogey from the bunker.

On the par-3 17th in the playoff, Streb's shot covered the flag and settled four feet below the hole. De Jonge missed a 35-foot birdie.

It was the second straight week for a first-time winner on the PGA Tour.
