A self-confessed Jammie Dodger addict who ate 24 biscuits a day has lost 16st after ditching the calorie-laden snack.

Sweet-toothed Tracey Foster, 41, from Rowley Regis, West Midlands, was 28st at her heaviest after becoming hooked on the biscuits for nearly 20 years.

The mother-of-two would routinely skip lunch and breakfast and instead opt for Jammie Dodgers washed down with mugs of sugary tea.

Sweet-tooth: Jammie Dodger addict, Tracey Foster, would eat 24 biscuits a day but has now lost 16st after ditching the treat

At the height of her addiction, Tracey would consume three packs of the treats a day - which accounted for 2,000 calories - the entire recommended daily amount for a woman.

She spent £1,255 each year on Jammie Dodgers which she bought in bulk from a local supermarket.

Tracey shot up to a size 30 after almost two decades of snacking on Jammie Dodgers during the day and eating takeaways in the evening.

She explained: 'Ever since I had my children I have struggled with my weight. It slowly crept up on me over the years and my love for Jammie Dodgers didn’t help. Some days I could eat a pack in one sitting and managed three packs a day. I would definitely say it was my addiction.

'Then eating curries and takeaways at night just made it all worse. I would eat a day’s worth of food in the evening, snacking on lumps of cheese, crisps and chocolate throughout the night.

'Fruit and vegetables were swear words in my house. You would never see me with a salad.'

Tracey, who suffers from arthritis, finally changed her ways after doctors refused to perform vital knee surgery in July 2011 due to her 50.23 Body Max Index (you're considered obese with a BMI over 30).

As she was: Tracey would consume three packs of the treats a day - which accounted for 2,000 calories - the entire recommended daily amount for a woman

The full-time mother declined gastric band surgery and joined a local weight loss group where she managed to lose 16 stone in two years after she switched to healthy meals.

Tracey also started regular swimming sessions with husband Scott, 40, to aid her weight loss.

Yesterday, Tracey, who is now a size 10, recorded a personal best 12st weigh-in.

She admits her quality of life has increased dramatically now she's no longer obese and she wishes she'd shed the pounds earlier.

Lifestyle overhaul: She used to dine on calorie-laden takeaways when she was at her heaviest (R) but has now adopted a healthy eating plan and joined Weight Watchers

She said: 'I wouldn’t go on holiday because I knew I wouldn't fit on an aeroplane seat. We didn’t go to pubs or restaurants because I didn’t even think I could fit in a toilet stall.

'Looking back I feel like I’ve missed out on this huge segment of my life. I was plodding along but not really living. On the rare times I went shopping I would see my reflection in the shop windows and nearly break down in tears.

'It was so easy to bury my head in the sand and ignore the fact that I was obese.
But it finally came to a head when I went to the doctor and he told me I
wouldn’t be able to have surgery on my knee because of my size. 'I thought "I can’t live this way anymore"'.

Tracey said her family, including daughter Charlotte, 16, and son Luke, 18, had helped her to stay focused on her weight loss.

Support: Tracey, pictured before her diet, said her husband Scott, daughter Charlotte, 16, and son Luke, 18, helped her to stay focused on her weight loss

She said: 'I wanted to do it on my own with diet and support and it was incredibly fulfilling to achieve my goal.

 24 biscuits (3 packs) a day - (2,040 calories) cost: £3.45

168 biscuits a week (21 packs) - (14,280 calories) cost: £24.15

8,736 biscuits a year (1,092 packs) - (92,820 calories) cost £1,255.80

'Scott loves the new me and my kids think it is brilliant. It was a battle and some days were hard.

'More than once I felt like giving up but I'm proud of myself and the fact I can say I lost 16 stone without surgery.'

Tracey attended the Weight Watchers group in Blackheath which meets once a week.

Group leader Anne Wythes said Tracey was an ‘inspirational’ member of the slimming group.

'I’ve been a leader for 11 years and Tracey is one of the most successful members I’ve ever worked with.

'For me, to see the difference that Tracey’s amazing weight loss has made to her life is so incredibly rewarding, her entire life has changed and I’m so glad it was my meeting that she came to,' she said.
