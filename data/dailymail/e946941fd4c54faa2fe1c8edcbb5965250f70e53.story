When I let you put up the New Year decorations I thought you'd be more festive

It’s usually the biggest night out of the year – but three-quarters of us will stay at home this New Year’s Eve, says a survey.

The high price of taxis, venue entry and drinks means the average New Year’s night out costs £73, leaving 37 per cent of us worrying about the budget.

A survey of 1,000 people by Morrisons found that 31 per cent of those entertaining at home will ask friends to bring a dish or bottle each to save cash.

Some 74 per cent of hosts want a stress-free night away from the oven, with 40 per cent serving a spread of party foods and only 11 per cent cooking a formal dinner.

Morrisons predicts it will sell 15 million olives, 5.3 million sausage rolls and two million bottles of sparkling wine and champagne across the country.

A separate survey by Post Office Home Insurance also found that one in 10 people were planning on not spending any money at all on New Year's Eve.

The Post Office study of more than 2,000 people revealed revellers were planning to spend £50 typically on seeing in 2014, £9 less than they had budgetted for last year.

Londoners are planning to spend the most celebrating the start of 2014 typically at £78, which is more than double the amount those living in Wales have set aside, at £37 on average.

Paul Havenhand, head of insurance at Post Office, said: 'It seems most people are looking forward to a celebratory night in, rather than a 'big night out' this New Year, and many are also looking to spend less this year too.'

As well as saving money, those preferring to spend the evening at home will also avoid the wet and windy weather set to blight New Year's Eve for many parts of the UK.

Up to 15mm of rain is predicted to fall across the land throughout the day on Tuesday and well in to the evening.

Again, those in the west will be hit the worst - with forecasters at the Met Office saying those areas can expect 'much more'.

There is 'no guarantee' rain will ease up before midnight, the weather service added.

The Met Office said 'wet and windy conditions' were set to continue throughout New Years Eve and into New Years day.

It
said conditions have been caused by a succession of low pressure 
systems which are set to continue throughout next week and into next 
weekend.

It added: 'The low pressure systems to come 
through over the next few days should not be as vigorous as the two that
we saw leading up to the Christmas period, but with saturated ground 
and high rivers there may be further yellow rain warnings being issued 
at times.

'The Met Office will continue to 
monitor the situation and review the warnings throughout the rest of 
today and over the weekend.'

Meteogroup forecaster Sean Penston added: 'It
won't be nearly as bad compared to the last two storms but it will no 
doubt make it hard for people recovering from flooding.'
