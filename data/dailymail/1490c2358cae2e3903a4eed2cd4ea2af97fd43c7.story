The Justice Department has charged former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden with espionage and theft of government property in the NSA surveillance case.

Officials have also asked the Hong Kong authorities to extradite the former government contracter who leaked the details of the NSA's top secret PRISM data collection programme.

Snowden, believed to be holed up in Hong Kong, has admitted providing information to the news media about two highly classified NSA surveillance programs.

A one-page criminal complaint unsealed Friday in federal court in Alexandria, Va., says Snowden engaged in unauthorized communication of national defense information and willful communication of classified communications intelligence information.

NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has been charged with espionage and theft and U.S. officials are seeking his extradition from Hong Kong

Both are charges under the Espionage Act. Snowden also is charged with theft of government property. All three crimes carry a maximum 10-year prison penalty.

The federal court in the Eastern District of Virginia where the complaint was filed is headquarters for Snowden's former employer, government contractor Booz Allen Hamilton.

The complaint is dated June 14, five days after Snowden's name first surfaced as the leaker of information about the two programs in which the NSA gathered telephone and Internet records to ferret out terror plots.

The complaint could become an integral part of a U.S. government effort to have Snowden extradited from Hong Kong, a process that could turn into a prolonged legal battle.

Snowden could contest extradition on grounds of political persecution. In general, the extradition agreement between the U.S. and Hong Kong excepts political offenses from the obligation to turn over a person.

Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, welcomed the charges. 'I've always thought this was a treasonous act,' he said in a statement. 'I hope Hong Kong's government will take him into custody and extradite him to the U.S.'

Iceland has a reputation for 
promoting internet freedoms and has long been discussed as an option for Snowden.

As a U.S. citizen, Snowden would not need a visa to enter Iceland and could immediately apply for asylum. He would be free to live in Iceland while immigration authorities decide his case, which could take more than a year, experts have said.

But if Snowden wants to seek refuge in Iceland, he'll have to get there first. And this is where the U.S. could have a chance.

Interpol will sometimes issue a 'red notice' - which is like an international arrest warrant - but keep it sealed so that the person doesn't know it exists. If he tried to travel, he would be arrested at the airport.

If he did get to Iceland, it is unknown if he would be safe. The government of newly-elected Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson is believed to be closer to Washington than past administrations and less keen to foster the country's cyber-haven image.

'I would be very surprised if they (the government) would be eager to engage in any international disputes with the U.S. And it is pretty difficult to be granted asylum here,' Stefania Oskarsdottir, lecturer in political science at the University of Iceland, told Reuters. 'I think what this guy is saying is based on something he is imagining or hoping for rather than actual facts.'

Iceland does have an extradition treaty with 
the United States, but it is unclear if it would cover any crimes 
that he might be charged with.

Michael di Pretoro, a retired 30-year
veteran with the FBI who served from 1990 to 1994 as the legal liaison 
officer at the American consulate in Hong Kong, said 'relations between 
U.S. and Hong Kong law enforcement personnel are historically quite 
good.'

'In my time, I felt the degree of 
cooperation was outstanding to the extent that I almost felt I was in an
FBI field office,' said di Pretoro.

The U.S. and Hong Kong cooperate on law enforcement matters and have a standing agreement on the surrender of fugitives.

However, Snowden's appeal rights could drag out any extradition proceeding.

The success or failure of any 
extradition proceeding depends on what the suspect is charged with under
U.S. law and how it corresponds to Hong Kong law under the treaty.

In 
order for Hong Kong officials to honor the extradition request, they 
have to have some applicable statute under their law that corresponds 
with a violation of U.S. law.

News of the charges broke on Friday 
evening, the same day it emerged that Snowden could be flown to Iceland 
from Hong Kong by the whistleblowing website WikiLeaks.

A businessman connected to the 
controversial website said a chartered private jet is ready for the 
30-year-old, who fled to Hong Kong after leaking U.S security details.

It comes after Iceland admitted holding talks with Snowden 
over the possibility of seeking political asylum.

Olafur Sigurvinsson, head of DataCell, which handles donations to Wikileaks, revealed details of the private jet.

Speaking to Channel2 television, he said: 'Everything is ready on our side and the plane could take off tomorrow.

'We have really done all we can do. We have a plane and all the logistics in place.'

The jet is believed to belong to a Chinese firm and has been chartered at a cost of $240,000.

WikiLeaks
founder Julian Assange revealed on Wednesday he had been in contact 
with Snowden's representatives to discuss his possible bid for asylum in
Iceland.

The former US government contractor fled to Hong Kong on May 20 after leaking National Security Agency programs.

It also emerged that a contractor for the National Security Agency found possible 
discrepancies in a resume submitted by Edward Snowden, but the company 
still employed him, a source said 
on Thursday.

Snowden was hired this spring after 
he convinced his hiring screeners at Booz Allen Hamilton, that his 
description of his education was truthful.

It is unclear precisely which element
of Snowden's resume caused personnel officials at Booz Allen Hamilton 
to raise questions about his background. Also unclear is how he 
satisfied their concerns.

Booz Allen Hamilton has said in a 
statement that 'we will work closely with our clients and authorities in
their investigation of this matter.'

Snowden fled his home in Hawaii, where he worked for NSA contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, after exposing the U.S. government's top surveillance secrets. He is at a secret location in Hong Kong.

In
a column in Icelandic daily newspaper Frettabladid, WikiLeaks spokesman
Kristinn Hrafnsson wrote that a middleman had approached him on behalf 
of Snowden.

'On 2 June, I received a message from Edward Snowden where he asked me to 
notify the Icelandic government that he wanted to seek asylum in 
Iceland,' Hrafnsson, who is also an investigative journalist in Iceland,
told Reuters.

Support: Snowden's image is displayed in Hong Kong, where the whistleblower is currently in hiding

He added 
that he has yet to receive a response from officials about his request 
but said they have a 'moral obligation' to answer the call for help.

The
Icelandic government, which has refused to say whether they would grant
asylum to Snowden, confirmed it had received the message from 
Hrafnsson.

'Kristinn Hrafnsson has contacted two ministries in an informal way but not the ministers,' a government spokesman said. 'There has been no formal approach in this matter.' 

Hrafnsson would not identify who the middleman was.

Snowden has previously mentioned Iceland as a possible refuge.

Iceland has a reputation for 
promoting Internet freedoms, but Snowden has said did not travel there 
immediately from the United States as he feared the country could be 
pressured by Washington.

'Iceland
could be pushed harder, quicker, before the public could have a chance 
to make their feelings known, and I would not put that past the current 
U.S. administration,' Snowden said in an online forum in the Guardian on
Monday.

It had been 
suggested that he would actually flee to the Icelandic consulate in Hong 
Kong, rather than risking boarding a plane to fly there in person.

Icelandic officials told USA Today last week that Snowden is missing a key element.

'The main stipulation for seeking 
asylum in Iceland would be that the person must be in Iceland to start 
the process,' said Johannes Tomasson, the chief spokesman for Iceland's 
Ministry of Interior in Reykjavik.

'That would be the ground rule No. 
1.'

WikiLeaks founder 
Julian Assange, who is holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London to 
avoid extradition to Sweden for questioning over allegations of sex 
crimes, visited Iceland several times in the run-up to some of the 
website's major releases.

Assange denies any wrongdoing.

Yet some experts added that Iceland might not be as welcoming as Snowden hopes.

The government of newly-elected Prime
Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson has not been tested in relation to these cases, but is believed to be closer to 
Washington than past administrations and less keen to foster the 
country's cyber-haven image.

'I would be very surprised if they 
(the government) would be eager to engage in any international disputes 
with the U.S. And it is pretty difficult to be granted asylum here,' 
Stefania Oskarsdottir, lecturer in political science at the University 
of Iceland, told Reuters.
