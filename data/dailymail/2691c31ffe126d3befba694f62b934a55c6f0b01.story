The handshake seen 'round the water cooler was no fluke, it turns out.

When President Barack Obama approached the podium at Nelson Mandela's memorial service and made a beeline for a row of foreign leaders – stopping first to shake Cuban dictator Raúl Castro's hand – it came after representatives from the two historically antagonistic nations had already been in talks for six months.

'[B]ehind the scenes,' two Daily Beast national security reporters wrote on Tuesday, 'U.S. and Cuban officials have held midlevel discussions in Havana and Washington on a range of issues, including direct postal service, migration issues, disaster response, and search and rescue at sea.'

During the president's trip back from South Africa, Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters on Air Force One that 'it's been quite some time since the Presidents of the United States and Cuba were even in the same place.'

But he acknowledged that 'we’re in talks on issues associated with
 migration that, again, I think allow for there to be greater 
connectivity particularly among Cuban Americans and Cuba.'

President Obama shook hands with Castro during the memorial service for former South African President Nelson Mandela, but the 'chance' meeting may indicate a more ordinary diplomatic future

News that the two leaders' deputies have been meeting in secret comes after nearly five years of a foreign policy thaw between the U.S. and the communist island nation, and nearly two decades after Mandela himself suggested that the two countries re-evaluate their icy Caribbean staring match.

The Obama administration has already turned heads by lifting an earlier prohibition on family travel and money transfers to Cuba. But a hostage situation and the iron fist that Castro wields against pro-Democracy activists have largely kept the U.S. at arms' length.

National Security Adviser Susan Rice laid out a case for the softer approach on Dec. 4 during a speech during a Washington, D.C. human right summit.

'Ultimately, it will be the Cuban people who drive economic and political reforms,' said Rice. 'And that’s why President Obama has increased the flow of resources and information to ordinary citizens.'

The hostage situation involves Alan Gross, who has sat in a Cuban jail for four years. He drew a 15-year sentence 'for facilitating uncensored Internet contact 'between a small religious community on the island and the rest of the world,' as White House Press Secretary Jay Carney put it on Dec. 3.

Gross penned a letter to Obama this month, asking for his direct participation in an effort to free him. Some observers hinted on Tuesday that the Obama–Castro handshake may have been an overture toward that end.

The Obama administration, meanwhile, faces immediate obstacles to a Cuba rapprochement that go far beyond the imprisonment of one American.

Raul Castro was a guerrilla commander under his brother Fidel in the 1950s and then helmed Cuba's armed forces for nearly five decades before becoming president in 2008. After the revolution, he was responsible for overseeing the executions of soldiers who were loyal to the deposed, U.S.-supported president Fulgencio Batista

Cuban-American lawmakers were brutal in their assessment of the South Africa handshake, and threaten to make noise if the White House takes public steps toward relaxing its half-century-long estrangement and trade embargo.

'It is nauseating': Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen slammed Obama for shaking hands with the Cuban strongman

'When the leader of the free world shakes the bloody hand of a ruthless dictator like Raul Castro, it becomes a propaganda coup for the tyrant,' Florida Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen said Tuesday during a Capitol Hill hearing.

Ron DeSantis, another Florida Republican, said in a statement that 'the excitement exhibited in some liberal quarters regarding the embrace of Raul Castro by President Obama ignores the millions of victims of the totalitarian Castro regime.'

'President Obama failed the people of Cuba with this very public handshake,' added Arizona Republican Rep. Matt Salmon.

Some criticism came from Democrats, including New Jersey Rep. Albio Sires.

'I'm very disappointed that the president would shake the hand of someone who stands for the opposite of everything Nelson Mandela stood for," the Cuban-American congressman told PolitickerNJ.

'Castro stands for the abuse of human rights and lack of freedom. It was just very hypocritical of the president to go and honor Mandela and then turn around and shake hands with Castro.'

In July the nation of Panama intercepted a ship traveling from Cuba to North Korea with a cargo of what the vessel's manifest said was sugar. It turned out to be a massive cache of missiles and missile parts intended for one of America's more fearful enemies, in violation of both U.S. and United Nations sanctions.

And while Obama and Castro shook hands in South Africa on International Human Rights Day, at least 20 human rights protesters were detained in Havana when they gathered for a public demonstration.

But when it's practical, the Obama administration has seemed to embrace Cuba's involvement in achieving America's other geopolitical objectives.

When Castro agreed to host peace talks between the Columbian government and a Marxist guerilla group called the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), Obama had good things to say about Cuba's decision to put FARC, which is has supported, in the same room with a government whose drug-interdiction policies are crucial to U.S. efforts along the same lines.

Episodes like that, some former government insiders say, have put America on a collision course with a Cuba that's suddenly interested in normalizing relations – an outcome that nearly every nation supported during a recent United Nations General Assembly..

'The Cubans regularly say to people that they are ready for a different relationship,' Obama administration veteran Dan Restrepo told The Daily Beast. During Obama's first term in the White House, Restrepo managed Latin America policy at the National Security Council.

He said in addition to one-on-one midlevel talks, intermediaries have delivered Castro’s messages to the Obama administration – usually U.S. citizens with connections to the Cuban government. Latin American diplomats political leaders, he added, have also been involved with back-channel-communications between Washington and Havana.

New America Foundation fellow Steve Clemons added that 'there has been a string of emissaries, both private citizens and Latin American leaders, who have begun to nudge Obama forward on engaging in talks with Cuba and also carrying a message from Castro that he’s willing to talk.'

Clemons has what the Daily Beast called 'exceptionally close ties to the Obama
 White House.' He also traveled with Vice President Joe Biden when he visited East Asia recently.
