David Forde is set to continue as first-choice goalkeeper for the Republic of Ireland in Sunday’s Euro Championship qualifier against Poland in Dublin.

Despite Shay Given’s eagerness to return to the frontline again, Ireland manager Martin O’Neill is reluctant to jettison Forde at this critical stage of the qualifiers.

The Millwall shotstopper has been rock solid since O’Neill took charge and has also kept two clean sheets against Poland in previous games.

The squad worked on set-piece shape behind closed doors at Aviva Stadium on Wednesday where the indications pointed to Forde as the last line of defence against the Poles, ahead of Given.

Forde, who is set to win his 24th cap, was watched by O’Neill on club duty last weekend. He was given a vote of confidence by the manager before the Euro 2016 qualifiers kicked off against Georgia last September, even though Given had been recalled.

O’Neill faces another massive call regarding Robbie Keane, Ireland’s record goalscorer and most capped player.

Keane, who was stationed by the manager’s side in Wednesday’s squad photo shoot, is pushing for a recall after his shock omission against the Scots last November.

O’Neill feels Keane is a lot fresher than he was four months ago and will be aware of the need for Ireland to score on Sunday at the Aviva.

Keane, 34, has scored four goals in his last two starts at the stadium.

After yesterday’s rest day, O’Neill will be keen to assess the fitness of James McClean, Glenn Whelan and Stephen Ward at training in Malahide today before finalising his strategy to face the Poles, with Forde likely to retain the No 1 jersey.

McClean (ankle) hasn’t trained since shipping a knock in training on Monday while Ward (ankle) has been on the easy list all week — both players have been first choice on the left flank for O’Neill. Whelan, sorely missed against the Scots in

Glasgow, had a tight hamstring but is expected to be fine.

Meanwhile, O’Neill and assistant Roy Keane were on hand last night as the Irish U21s edged out Andorra 1-0 at the RSC in Waterford last night.

Dylan Connolly’s 31st-minute goal separated the sides in the opening 2017 Euro qualifier.
