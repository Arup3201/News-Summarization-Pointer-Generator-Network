From a roast turkey to a prime beefburger and a moreish Belgian bun, this is a feast that no one could fail to enjoy. Provided you like cake, of course.

Every single part of the strikingly realistic-looking array is made from sponge cake, from the turkey's tomato garnish to the glass of Coca-Cola next to the burger.

The amazing gateaux were created by Beverly Hills patissier, Rosebud Cakes, which, along with food, also makes cakes in the shape of guitars, dogs and designer bags among others.

The company, which has produced 
edible artworks for Sean Connery, the Real Housewives and Shaquille 
O'Neal among others, was started by Elin Katz over 25 years ago.

Katz said: 'People are surprised at how realistic they look. We did a turkey cake for Thanksgiving once and someone pulled the leg off because they thought it was the actual turkey.

"Before I start making them I meet up with the customer to see what their needs are and volley a few ideas back and forth.

'I try to do something special for 
them to make them laugh or so that they are deeply touched and make it 
as personable as possible.'

Katz, who, along with her husband, has been decorating cakes for more than 30 years also revealed that the secret of her success is making sure each piece is as individually interesting as possible.

'I draw a sketch - and we decide the
size, colour scheme, flavours and which bits will be edible. I 
just start with a square or circle base and go from there.

'I always try to do something fresh and give people more than just an object.'

Making the cakes can be a time-consuming business, and getting it right can take as much as three days per cake.

'It usually takes a day to make a complete cake,' she says. 'But some projects have taken three days. I have a team of about four people who perform specific roles in the construction.

'The hardest cake I worked on was one I did recently - a Darth Vader and Storm Trooper. That took three days to make and getting it right was really tough.'

Not surprisingly, Katz's edible art doesn't come cheap, with cakes priced between $300 (£200) and $10,000 (£6,650) depending on how intricate the order is.

Interestingly, Katz's busiest time of year isn't the wedding season, but Halloween. 'Halloween is my favourite time, it's so much fun. I always have fun doing those cakes,' she reveals.

'It's stressful because you have a 
lot to put out in a short amount of time. You always wonder whether the 
cake will make it to the party of event. But I have a passion for it, so very day I get up and I'm glad I have this job and make people happy.

'I found my calling - it's so creative and unique.'
