Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt today told MPs that managers who fail patients will be struck off and barred from working in the NHS again

Doctors and nurses could be given pay rises simply for treating their patients with compassion.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt yesterday promised a ‘radical overhaul’ of the NHS, putting a far greater emphasis on old-fashioned care in the wake of the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal.

He said one measure could be to introduce a system of pay rises which would see staff rewarded if they show ‘compassion, dignity and respect’ when treating patients.

But patient groups said nurses should not have to be paid extra just for doing their jobs properly.

Joyce Robins, of Patient Concern, said: ‘It’s incredible when you think of the level that nursing care, and medical care in general, has sunk to. Compassion should be part of doctors’ and nurses’ jobs.

‘They are quite well paid as it is – they certainly should not be getting more. To talk about giving people more money for something they should be doing anyway is wrong.’

The pay plans were among a raft of measures announced by Mr Hunt yesterday in the hope of preventing another disaster on the scale of Mid Staffordshire, where as many as 1,200 patients died from ‘routine’ neglect.

Last month a damning report by Robert Francis, QC, warned of a culture of fear in the Health Service that was obsessed with targets to the detriment of patients. It warned that unless major changes were made to the NHS, the neglect and horrific treatment at Mid Staffordshire would be repeated.

In his formal response to the Francis report, Mr Hunt called the scandal ‘a betrayal of the worst kind’. He said NHS staff would now have a legal ‘duty of candour’ to tell the truth about patient care to patients, families and the Government.

Hospitals could be fined if they fiddle figures on death rates or waiting times or hide mistakes from patients and families.

A series of measures will be enforced in response to the needless deaths of up to 1,200 patients at Stafford Hospital

The Government is also considering 
prosecuting individual doctors or nurses who cover up their mistakes. 
Hospitals will also face tougher inspections from the Care Quality 
Commission which could last up to a month.

They will be rated as ‘outstanding, good, requiring improvement or poor’, in a process similar to the Ofsted system in schools.

And Mr Hunt said he would work closely
with hospitals and NHS Employers, the organisation which sets wages, to
ensure that pay rises given to staff were linked to ‘high quality 
care’.

Under the current system, thousands of
doctors and nurses are given salary increases of up to 8 per cent every
few years just for doing the same job. Hospital doctors earn an average
of £74,000 a year rising to £109,000 for consultants. Nurses are paid 
around £30,500 a year.

It is not yet clear how staff would be
monitored on the quality of their care but it could be through the new 
Friends and Family test, given to patients after hospital treatment. 
Patients are asked if they would recommend the hospital to friends and 
family.

Mr Hunt said: ‘The events at Stafford Hospital were a betrayal 
of the worst kind. A betrayal of the patients, of the families, and of 
the vast majority of NHS staff who do everything in their power to give 
their patients the high-quality, compassionate care they deserve.

‘The health and care system must 
change. We cannot merely tinker around the edges – we need a radical 
overhaul with high-quality care and compassion at its heart.’

As revealed by the Mail yesterday, 
student nurses will be made to work for a year as healthcare assistants 
on wards to give them experience of hands-on care.

Ministers will also 
appoint a chief inspector of hospitals and a chief inspector of care 
homes who will rate organisations.

Campaigners, including relatives of those who died at Mid Staffordshire said the measures didn’t go far enough.

Julie Bailey, who set up Cure the NHS 
after the death of her mother, said: ‘We need safe staffing levels and 
the correct skill mix, that’s the start that’s needed, then we need to 
look at the training.

‘I think there needs to be far more 
emphasis on who they select to go into nursing. We’ve got staff who 
don’t want to work for the NHS, we’ve got patients frightened, older 
people frightened to go into NHS hospitals.

‘This has got to change, and it’s not 
going to change with this style of leadership, command and control. We 
need much more emphasis on the culture and behaviours of the people 
within the NHS, and that starts at the top.’
