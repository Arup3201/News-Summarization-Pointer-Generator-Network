Hedge fund trader Julian Rifat leaked insider tips about companies including Barclays and Volkswagen in exchange for a luxury car and holiday

A hedge fund trader who leaked insider tips about companies including Barclays and Volkswagen in exchange for a luxury car and a family holiday to Oman has been jailed. 

Julian Rifat, 45, abused his senior position at Moore Capital to leak tips about eight major firms.

He used the inside information to place trades worth £285,000 through an associate to top up his basic salary of £125,000 and £615,000 bonus.

Rifat, who lived in a £1.2million home in Oxford, was today jailed for 19 months during a hearing at Southwark Crown Court.

His prosecution was the ninth under Operation Tabernula - an investigation launched in the wake of the financial crisis by regulators the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). 

Rifat, once dubbed the 'face' of the American hedge fund, faced a single charge of insider dealing between 1 June and 24 November 2009.

Prosecutor Mark Ellison QC, for the FCA, said: 'The total value of all eight trades being £285,000, they were all in the form of spread bets. 

'[Rifat] was employed at the time of offending as a senior trader by Moore Capital. He was FCA approved at the time of the offences and had been for a number of years.

'He was in essence, on the evidence, the person at Moore Capital in London that senior bankers would approach to discuss transactions.

'He was effectively, to a considerable degree, the face of Moore Capital in that respect for the purpose of European investment decisions.

'In fact in Mr Rifat's own words he says he was somebody who had direct access to the top four people in the firm. He was somebody who clearly was in a very responsible and trusted position.'

Rifat would be approached by investors about major deals before the information was communicated to the market in a practice known as 'wall crossing'.

However, he would then use this information to tip-off associate Graeme Shelley, a broker at Novum Securities Ltd, who placed trades on his behalf.

In return, Shelley, 45, paid around £60,000, including a £15,000 family trip to Oman and a brand new Range Rover.

Mr Ellison said: 'Once the inside was wall crossed within the company the entire firm was restricted from trading in the stock sharing until a public announcement was made or the offer withdrawn.

'After he had been wall crossed, Mr Rifat would make the time to give Mr Shelley either a ring or a text so as to provide the inside information.'

Rifat, who worked in the company's London offices, was first arrested on his 41st birthday in 2010.

Despite being put on administrative leave by his employers, he was still paid his huge salary as well as two £700,000 payments as part of a 'compromise agreement'.

Rex Tedd QC, for Rifat, said his client was being paid cash that was owed to him as unpaid bonuses from previous years.

It was not a 'golden goodbye', he insisted. 'He is someone who made a career in this financial world. That took a huge amount of effort and a considerable degree of skill.

'The measure of how much he was earning is really the measure of how much he has thrown away through this dishonest conduct.

'What he has lost has been enormous and that can never be regained... he can never have any significant position within the world which he is suited.'

As well as being given a brand new Range Rover, Rifat also accepted a £15,000 family holiday to Oman (file picture) in exchange for tip-offs

Sentencing Rifat, Judge Alistair McCreath, QC, said:  'There can be no doubt at all that in your employment you held a pivotal position, there was reposed in you a very high degree of trust.

'You were described by one of your witnesses in relation to wall crossing as the 'go-to man' so in the organisation for which you worked if there was a question of wall crossing it was to you they came and therefore this highly sensitive information initially to you.

'I must secondly have regard to the circumstances in which you came to be in possession of the confidential information and the use you made of it,' he said.

'It needs to be added that because this information came to you in relation to the eight episodes shortly before the information came public and therefore at a time when the clients could do nothing about market fluctuation. The information was very sensitive indeed.

'The use you made of it is clear, that you have quickly given that information to Mr Shelley who then used it to make unlawful profit.'

Sentencing Rifat to 19 months in prison, the judge added: 'I know the impact this will have on your family and I would if it were possible wish to suspend it, but I'm afraid I cannot.

'This sort of offending is serious in the way I have described and must, save in the most exceptional cases, be marked by an immediate term of imprisonment.'

The trader was also fined £100,000 and ordered to pay prosecution costs of £159,402.

Shelley and another associate Paul Milsom, an equity dealer at Legal and General, had already pleaded guilty to insider dealing.

Georgina Philippou, acting director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said: 'Mr Rifat's behaviour exploited financial markets during a particularly challenging time just as they were taking steps to recover from the 2008 crisis.

'The smooth running of our financial markets requires market professionals to play by the rules - Mr Rifat knew the rules, but he abused them for his own benefit.'

In a statement released through his lawyers after the sentencing, Rifat said he was 'deeply disappointed' at being jailed.

He said: 'After five years of essentially feeling like I have been in open prison and all the uncertainty and delay related to the investigation I truly feel that I have already served my time.

'Whilst I am apologetic and remorseful for the nonsensical offences that I have pleaded guilty to today, I take issue with much of the prosecution's assertions.'
