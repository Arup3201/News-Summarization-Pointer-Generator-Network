King Arthur had the right idea - seat people on a round table and they are less likely to be argumentative and more likely to feel 'they belong', new research claims.

But put them in rows, such as a row of candidates opposite Alan Sugar on The Apprentice, and it is more likely to bring out a person's 'individual' streak.

The findings could be useful for the layouts of classrooms, restaurants and hotel lobbies, said economic professors.

Strategic: Canadian researchers found that people seated in a circular pattern were less likely to argue than those sat in a square or in a row

It could even make the difference to the way people feel at events like weddings or in a meeting, said the study for the Journal of Consumer Research.

Canadian researchers sat volunteers around different shaped tables and analysed their reactions to a variety of advertising.

They found that those seated in a circle or oval were more positive about adverts which conveyed groups - such as a family or a bunch of friends.

Those seated in angular arrangements, such as in a square or rectangle, identified more with those ads portraying individuals or mavericks.

Subconsciously, the style of seating brings out one of two conflicting attitudes, said the researchers from Alberta and British Columbia universities.

Authors Juliet Zhu and Jennifer Argo wrote: 'The geometric shape of a seating arrangement can impact consumers by priming one of two fundamental needs - the need to belong or the need to be unique.'

They added: 'Seating arrangements influence consumers in a wide range of settings such as restaurants, hotel lobbies, public transit, or waiting areas in airports and doctors' offices.

'Circular-shaped seating arrangements prime a need to belong while angular shaped seating arrangements prime a need to be unique.'

Dog eat dog: The findings could have implications for businesses who hold regular meetings and want increase productivity and avoid confrontations between colleagues

Circular seating arrangements are often used on TV to convey a warmer, conversational approach, such as with football pundits on Match of the Day.

Graham Norton's guests, for instance, are sat together on a curved sofa and his chair is positioned as an extension of the same semi circle to produce a chatty, friendly show.

But when Jeremy Paxman famously grilled an increasingly flustered Michael Howard on Newsnight, they were positioned geometrically opposite each other.

That interview is now famous for being confrontational with Paxman asking the then Tory Home Secretary to repeatedly answer the same question he felt he was avoiding.

On The Apprentice, the candidates sit at one side of a long rectangle table and the panel led by Lord Sugar at the other, and the result is a lot more confrontational.

The researchers added: 'The shape of a seating arrangement, a subtle environmental cue, can activate fundamental human needs, and these needs in turn affect consumer responses.'
