A top television executive has taken the blame for a public street fight with his best friend, Australia’s third richest man, outside a luxury apartment complex at Sydney's Bondi Beach on Sunday.

David Gyngell, 47, chief executive of Nine Entertainment, has said he started the brawl with billionaire casino mogul James Packer, 46, at the latter's home in the exclusive Sydney suburb.

Despite Mr Gyngell admitting he instigated the fight, and that no complaints have been made, police are now investigating the incident which was captured on camera and widely published in newspapers across Australia this morning.

Mr Gyngell and Mr Packer’s fathers revolutionised the television industry in Australia and as well as being best friends since high school, they were each other’s best men at their weddings.

Mr Gyngell’s television company, The Nine Network, later broadcast a statement where he accepted blame for the fight on the curb outside James Mr Packer’s flat on Sunday.

 ‘David Gyngell respects the job police do and will cooperate fully with their investigation,’ the statement said.

‘He also fully accepts that he was the instigator of the incident,’ it said.

‘Clearly had he not turned up at Mr Packer's premises in an angry mood, then the confrontation would never have occurred.’

News Corp., headed by Mr Packer and Mr Gyngell’s long-time friend Lachlan Murdoch, reportedly paid more than $200,000 for pictures of the outside Mr Packer's luxury apartment at Bondi Beach on Sunday.

James Packer is chairman of Crown Resorts and has interests in casinos in Australia, Macau and Manila. Forbes lists him as Australia's third-richest person worth an estimated $6.6 billion and he is allegedly dating supermodel Miranda Kerr.

It is said that the fight started after Mr Packer sent angry texts to Mr Gyngell after seeing a van from the latter’s television channel parked near his apartment and assumed Nine were trying to catch him and Miss Kerr together.

Nine employee Nick Tokic later told 
reporters that he lived near Mr Packer and had brought the van home 
overnight for an early job Monday morning.

Mr
 Packer had just returned home to Sydney from Jerusalem and was met by 
an angry Mr Gyngell blocking his driveway when he arrived at his flat.

Cause of it all? Packer is said to have become angry when he thought a TV van from Gyngell's network was trying to catch him with his alleged new girlfriend, supermodel Miranda Kerr, pictured with her son Flynn in Sydney on the day of the fight

Mr Gyngell can be heard shouting: 'I didn't even know you were in f****** Australia,' in video footage of the punch-up.

The pair fought for several minutes while Mr Packer's driver and security guard attempted to separate them.

Mr Packer and Mr Gyngell released a joint media statement on Monday which they said would be their last word on the fight.

‘We have been friends for 35 years and still are,’ they said. ‘In that time, we have had our fair share of ups and downs.’

New South Wales state police on Tuesday said they were investigating the melee and appealed for any witnesses to come forward, despite no official complaint being made.
