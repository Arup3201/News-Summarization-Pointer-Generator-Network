Guilty: Mziwamadoda Qwabe has admitted to the murder of Anni Dewani

A hitman has made fresh claims that honeymooner Anni Dewani’s murder was ordered by her husband.

Mziwamadoda Qwabe said the killing in his native South Africa was designed to appear like ‘a random criminal act’.

He claimed he was told that businessman Shrien Dewani  ‘wanted the wife killed’ and that it had to look like a robbery.

Qwabe, 27, claimed he helped to hijack the couple’s taxi and was behind the wheel when a second hitman, sitting beside him, turned round and shot Mrs Dewani, 28, in the neck.

The father of three’s previously unheard story was laid out in his signed confession document accepted by Cape Town’s High Court yesterday.

He admitted kidnapping, robbery, owning an unlicensed gun and premeditated murder.

While these crimes would normally merit life in prison, Qwabe received 25 years and will be eligible for parole in 17 years, under the terms of a plea bargain to testify against Dewani, 32, from Bristol.

Dewani adamantly rejects accusations that he commissioned and paid for the murder in November 2010.

His most recent extradition hearing 
was told that he is mentally unfit to return to South Africa for trial 
due to post-traumatic stress disorder and severe depression.

In his confession, Qwabe named Dewani 
as a co-conspirator in kidnapping, murder and robbery, and says he was 
recruited for the ‘job’ by taxi driver Zola Tongo, who was jailed for 18
 years for his role in the crime.

Yesterday Mrs Dewani’s uncle, Ashok 
Hindocha, said: ‘We are just happy. Two of the accused have now pleaded 
guilty. Now we want to know what really happened to Anni, why they 
killed her.’

But he added: ‘I would have been much,
 much happier if all the accused were in South Africa and 
cross-examination took place and the truth could be found.

‘To us, Anni is still not dead. We 
haven’t started the mourning process. We can’t. We need to know what 
happened and then we can start working our way through it.’

Shrien Dewani has always protested his
 innocence in the case of his wife Anni's murder. The South African 
authorities claim there is evidence of his involvement but Dewani's 
supporters have answers for many of the questions raised.

Why did the Dewanis enlist the services of cabbie Zola Tongo instead of using a designated hotel taxi?

A
 Dewani family spokesman said there was nothing unusual in jumping into a
 taxi on arrival at a foreign airport. The trip to South Africa had been
 'very last minute', he said, and the Cape Grace hotel where the couple 
were staying had just one luxury limousine transfer that had to be 
booked in advance, costing 600 rand (£56) per journey.

Why was Dewani not harmed in the incident when his wife was driven off and killed?

Dewani's
 friends say he made every possible effort to save her. They say he was 
ejected from the cab in a township and did not know where he was. He 
went knocking on doors and tried to summon help, they said. Dewani is 
also reported to have said he was dragged out of the vehicle, struggling
 throughout.

Why did the couple choose to visit Gugulethu, an area known to be unsafe?

The
 honeymooners were said to have wanted to see the 'real' South Africa. 
It has also been claimed that Tongo suggested he take them to a place 
where they could see some African dancing and that the couple were 
lukewarm about going.

Why did CCTV footage show Dewani chatting to Tongo for 13 minutes shortly after his arrival at the Cape Grace hotel?

Dewani's
 supporters have reportedly claimed he was discussing with the taxi 
driver his and Mrs Dewani's plans for the next few days.

Why did CCTV footage from the hotel three days after the murder show 
Tongo apparently receiving a white plastic packet from Dewani, 
supporting the taxi driver's claim that he was paid for the hit that 
day?

Friends
 and relatives of Dewani have pointed out that if he had left the 
country without settling the taxi fare he would have been accused of 
running off without paying his debts.
