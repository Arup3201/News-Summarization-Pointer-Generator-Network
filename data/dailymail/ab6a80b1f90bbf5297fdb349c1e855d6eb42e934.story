A disturbing video has emerged of a police officer pulling over a 76-year-old man and violently cuffing him before Tasering him twice

During the footage, Under Ground Kings by rapper Drake blares from the cruiser's radio, reports the Victoria Advocate.

The incident comes at a time when police brutality is being closed watched in the US following a spate high-profile cases such as that of Michael Brown, Eric Garner and Trayvon Martin,

The incident happened  after Robinson saw an expired inspection sticker on the car Vasquez was driving back to a garage where he helps with mechanical work.

After Robinson pulled up behind him, Vasquez got out of the car, which is owned by the car lot, attempting to get the manager.

After Robinson pulled up behind him, Vasquez got out of the car, and walked around to the back of the car to show Robinson the dealer tags, which would make it exempt from having an inspection

Robinson arrested Vasquez for the expired sticker and grabbed his arm in a forceful manner

He walked around to the back of the car to show Robinson the dealer tags, which would make the vehicle legally exempt from having an inspection.

But Robinson arrested Vasquez for the expired sticker and grabbed his arm, to which the pensioner pulled away and raised his other arm to swat him away.

Robinson then pushed Vasquez down on the hood of the police cruiser and wrapped both arms under his shoulders so the pair fell to the ground.

When the cop is next seen in frame, he was yelling and holding up a stun gun. 

Police said the officer used the Taser on Vasquez twice while he was on the ground.

'He just acted like a pit bull, and that was it,' Vasquez said. 

'For a while, I thought he was going to pull his gun and shoot me.'

When other officers arrive on the scene, they ask Vasquez for his side of the story and check to see if he is injured.

'Are you hurting anywhere?' the unidentified officer can be heard asking on the video.

'Not yet,' Vasquez replies. 

'Probably later on. I'm 76 years old.'

Vasquez was taken to a hospital, then released without being cited.

Larry Urich, a 62-year-old sales manager at the car lot who watched the incident unfold, said he wanted the officer fired and prosecuted for excessive use of force and causing bodily harm to an elderly person. 

'I told the officer, 'What in the hell are you doing?' This gentleman is 76 years old,' Urich said. 

'The cop told me to stand back, but I didn't shut up. I told him he was a god damn Nazi Stormtrooper.'

Chief J.J. Craig admitted the footage 'raises some concerns.'

He decided to open the investigation after viewing the footage and has personally apologized to Vasquez for the incident. 

Robinson could face a range of punishment from a letter of reprimand to suspension without pay or termination, Craig told the Advocate. 

The investigation will also examine the details of the arrest.

Vasquez said his body still hurts and added: 'I feel like my rights were violated.'

'The police department is supposed to train their police officers to be more conscientious and use common sense. I don't think he had any.'
