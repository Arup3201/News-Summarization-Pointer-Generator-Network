In a single day at the height of the Battle of Britain he shot down three German fighters – one before breakfast, one after breakfast and one in the evening.

Air Commodore Ronald Berry became one of the RAF’s greatest aces of the Second World War, helping to destroy some 30 enemy aircraft.

Indeed, he was held in such esteem that he was one of the few airmen chosen to lead Winston Churchill’s coffin at his funeral in 1965.

Now the medals of this remarkable pilot are expected to fetch a six-figure sum at auction, not least because Air Commodore ‘Ras’ Berry as he was nicknamed was one of The Few who helped save Britain in the battle for the skies in the summer of 1940.

Sale: Air Cdre Berry won the CBE as well as the DSO, DFC, 1939-45 Star, Air Crew Europe Star, Africa Star, Defence Medal, War Medal and Air Efficiency Award

The Spitfire pilot, who died in 2000 
aged 83, later admitted that seeing German bombers destroy British 
cities had motivated him to wreak revenge on the enemy.

He
 was involved in one of the first dogfights of the war in December 1939 
and also fought the Luftwaffe over France and North Africa.

In all, he notched up an impressive tally of up to 30 ‘claims’ on enemy aircraft, including 14 confirmed ‘kills’.

On
 August 31, 1940, aged just 23, he destroyed three Messerschmitt 109 
planes after being scrambled three times in one day. Air Commodore 
Berry, who sported a handlebar moustache, was born in Hull in 1917.

Two
 months after the outbreak of war he was sent to Montrose in Scotland to
 help protect the airfield there and served in 603 Squadron.

Days later 
he was involved in one of the earliest interceptions of the war when he 
damaged a Heinkel 111 bomber.

Due to increasing RAF casualties, 603 
Squadron was sent to Southern England in August 1940 during the height 
of the Battle of Britain.

By the following month, the pilot was involved
 in up to four dogfights a day, earning him his first Distinguished 
Flying Cross.

After the 
Battle of Britain he was one of only eight out of the 24 original pilots
 from the Squadron left. He was promoted to Squadron Leader and took 
part in convoy patrols. His fighting record later continued in Tunisia.

After the war he was in charge of the Air Fighting Development Unit in 
Norfolk, and was appointed OBE in 1946 and CBE in 1965. He later retired
 with wife Nancy, with whom he had a daughter, to East Yorkshire.

A
 spokesman for London auctioneers Spink said: ‘Ronald Berry was very 
much one of The Few who stopped Operation Sea Lion, Hitler’s plan to 
invade Britain, from happening.’ The medals are being sold in London on 
April 24.

Skills: The pilot, right, was one of the 'Few' who saved Britain from invasion by the Nazis
