It was man vs. food and the giant meal won.

Jacob Whitaker, 20, from Yadkinville, North Carolina, took on Old Stage Grill's burger eating challenge but was unable to finish his plate in the 45-minute time frame.

He thought he would have no problem polishing off the 4lb double bacon cheeseburger and 2lb portion of cheese fries - totaling more than 10,000 calories - but was surprised by how difficult the feat was. 

'The cheese... there was a lot of cheese,' he said, commenting on what he found most difficult.

A spokesperson from the American-themed diner said they weren't sure about the nutritional value of the burger but  it contains an 'unrealistic amount of calories.'

Challengers are asked to put up $40 in advance.

If they succeed in eating all the food in 45 minutes, they get their money back, a T-shirt and their name on the wall. 

If they lose, the restaurant keeps the $40. 

Whitaker didn't meet the challenge but was forgiven the $40 dollar fee.  

He said that he plans to keep trying until he can clean his plate.

'It's a lot harder [than I thought it was] and I wasn't prepared,' he said, commenting on his first attempt last Wednesday.

'I got it in my head that I couldn't do it and was sort of slowing down.'
