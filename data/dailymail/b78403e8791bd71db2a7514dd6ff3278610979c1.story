A high school senior has won the right to wear her 'I ♥ Boobies (Keep a Breast)' bracelet to school - after a two year battle with administrators who complained the accessory was disruptive. 

Sara Dickinson, whose grandmother died from breast cancer, was threatened with detention and even a court injunction after she wore the jewelry to support cancer awareness during her sophomore year at Nathan Hale-Ray High School in East Haddam, Connecticut.

The high schooler enlisted the help of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Connecticut, who said the school was denying the teenager her First Amendment right to free speech.

According to Dickinson, she bought 
the $4 rubber wrist band from The Keep A Breast Foundation, a 
youth-focused cancer advocacy group during her sophomore year.

But after wearing the bracelet for a 
few months in 2010, she faced resistance and was told by her school 
principal, Eric Spencer, that she could no longer bring it to school 
because it was disruptive to students.

'I could see how [the bracelet] could
be distracting but my rationale was that kids in my school walk around 
with hair that is absolutely neon pink,' Dickinson told The Hartford Courant, adding, 'I really feel that neon pink hair is much more distracting than a white bracelet.'

She
relented and stopped wearing the bracelet but after a friend's mother 
was diagnosed with breast cancer, she began wearing it again to school. 
This time it was confiscated on two occasions and she was threatened 
with detention.

Dickinson
said that school officials presented a compromise last June, offering 
to let students design a similar bracelet but with different language. 
She added that the school said they would seek an injunction to prohibit
her from wearing the wrist band at school if she persisted.

Dickinson rejected this offer and instead contacted the ACLU for guidance.

The advocacy group wrote to the 
Connecticut school in early August, saying that a student's right to 
free speech still must be protected within the confines of school 
property, citing a Supreme Court case from 1969 - Tinker v. Des Moines 
Independent Community School District.

The
letter further explained that limits on a child's speech is only 
justified if the language threatens to 'materially or substantially 
interfere with ... the operations of the school' or if it is deemed 
'vulgar and lewd,' according to another case in 1986, Bethel School Dis.
No. 403 v. Fraser.

Disruptive? The teenager says she doesn't think her bracelet is as disruptive of some of the odd fashions she sees high schoolers sporting

In 2011, a Pennsylvania School District similarly objected to the 'I ♥ Boobies (Keep a Breast)' tagline and a group of female students from the area have been embroiled in a back-and-forth legal battle.

A federal judge ruled in April that the ban, on the grounds the language is lewd, vulgar or sexually offensive, was unconstitutional. The school district has appealed the decision and arguments are expected to be heard in early 2013.

Given the legal precedence, the ACLU requested that the Connecticut school district rethink their policy forbidding Dickinson and other students from wearing the bracelet.

After receiving the letter, the school reached out to Dickinson's mother, Terry, informing her that Sara could resume wearing her bracelet to school.

'It's nice to know somebody is going to let me exercise my rights,' Dickinson told the local paper, adding, 'The whole point was to get everybody talking, to raise awareness of breast cancer.'

The ACLU was similarly celebrating the victory.

'The school district has made the right decision. Public school students have free speech rights that can't be violated merely because school officials dislike the message or the way it's expressed,' Sandra Staub, legal director of the ACLU of Connecticut, said in a statement.

'While restrictions can be placed on speech that threatens a substantial disruption in the school or on speech that is so lewd and vulgar as to undermine the educational mission, Sara's bracelet caused no such harm,' she added.
