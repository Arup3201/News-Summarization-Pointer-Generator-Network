It's Hot or Not time again as IAN LADYMAN reveals what's been making him feel warm this week and what's been leaving him cold inside.

WHAT'S HOT

FC UNITED

Sir Alex Ferguson was persistently irritated by FC United, which is one of the many reasons to quite like them. Set up in opposition to the Glazer takeover at the other United in 2005, the club has moved steadily up the non-league pyramid, has a new £5million stadium on the horizon and has now announced a remarkable friendly against Benfica in May to mark its ten-year anniversary. Proof that there is another way to enjoy football after all.

LAWN AND RHODES

Mark Lawn appeared on Match of the Day last Saturday wearing a dubious tie and looking as though he's not unfamiliar with the odd night at Bradford's best curry houses. And who is to say he isn't entitled? He and the more reserved Julian Rhodes are joint chairmen of Bradford City. Their money saved the club from extinction in 2002 and they will never get it back. Now, though, the two have a League Cup final and a win at Chelsea to reflect on.

THE BIG BASH

Some idealists - including West Indies legend Michael Holding and my own father - refuse to watch Twenty20 cricket, deriding it as a betrayal of the sport's very fundamentals. But consider this: if you can't perform two of cricket's three basic skills (bowl, bat or field) very well then you won't even get a game. Australia's annual shindig is competitive, skilful and doesn't carry passengers. If you don't think it's proper cricket then you aren't watching closely enough.

WHAT'S NOT 

MICHAEL OLIVER

Deep in to Chelsea's riveting clash with Liverpool on Tuesday, home full-back Branislav Ivanovic was seen shaking hands with the match referee after being booked. It seemed a peculiar business but on reflection seems entirely appropriate. Ivanovic was clearly congratulating Oliver on making his first correct decision of the night. One more stamp from (Diego) Costa and Martin Skrtel would have qualified for a free cappuccino.

MANUEL PELLEGRINI

Sleeping on a plane - first class or at the back - is nothing like being in your own bed. But then, to some, the FA Cup is nothing like the Barclays Premier League. So maybe that was why the Manchester City manager scheduled his players to fly back from Abu Dhabi less than 24 hours before they played - and lost - against Middlesbrough last weekend. Let's hope the in-flight movies were worth it.

MARIA SHARAPOVA

We wish the 27-year-old well in the Australian Open final on Saturday against Serena Williams. More so, we hope the ensuing phone chat with father Yuri goes ok. Sharapova Snr used to be his daughter's rather volatile coach. Now he skis while she plays and shouts if she loses, offering us a depressing insight in to the women's tour we would rather not see. 'I like honesty, I appreciate that,' said Sharapova. Yes, Maria, of course you do.
