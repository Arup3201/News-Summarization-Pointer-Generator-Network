'Outrageous': The Eco Garage on Holland Road, West London was selling diesel at 177.9p a litre

Millions of Britons will begin their Easter getaway tomorrow under the shadow of the fuel panic fiasco.

Drivers will face congestion, roadworks and record prices to fill up their tanks.

Petrol is at a record 141.79p a litre and diesel at 147.71p – although many garages are charging much higher prices.

Chelsea Cloisters Services in 
Knightsbridge, West London, was yesterday charging an incredible 174.9p a
 litre for petrol, while the ECO filling station in Kensington’s Holland
 Road was selling diesel at 177.9p a litre.

AA
 president Edmund King said: ‘These prices are absolutely outrageous and
 beyond the pale. Some garages are clearly cashing in and profiteering 
from the panic at the previous pumps.’

The RAC said petrol was 6p a litre more expensive than at Easter last year and more than 24p compared to Easter 2010.

Diesel is now averaging 147.71p a litre compared with 141.69p at Easter 2011 and only 117.6p at Easter 2010.

RAC patrol ambassador of the year, Kevin Andrews, said: 'Although the high cost of fuel is likely to put many off travelling this Easter it's still important for people to plan their journeys before setting off to avoid getting lost and wasting precious fuel.

'Allow plenty of time for your journey particularly if you're heading for a popular resort or travelling at peak times.'

Talks aimed at resolving the fuel tanker drivers dispute and head off the threat of strikes are currently underway.

Conciliation service Acas are acting as mediator between Unite, the union representing tanker drivers, and seven distribution companies.

The dispute over terms and 
conditions and health and safety has been brewing for more than a year 
but flared up last week when Unite announced that workers in five of the
 firms had voted to strike.

The Government advised motorists to top 
up with fuel, leading to chaotic scenes at garages across the country as
 people queued for petrol.

Unite announced on Friday it would not be 
striking over Easter as it engaged with Acas over the peace moves, and 
would have to give seven days notice of any industrial action.

Unite General Secretary Len McCluskey said: 'For nearly two years, we have been trying to persuade the fuel distribution sector to work with us to defend best practice across the industry.

'It is vital that common, minimum standards on safety, training, wages and pensions are agreed to put a floor of best practice in the sector.'

No fuel: Garages across the country have seen their fuel supplies dry up after the Government sparked a frenzy of panic buying at the pumps ahead of a potential tanker strike

Waiting game: Drivers caused a backlog of traffic in some areas last week as they queued up for petrol and diesel while sales of jerry cans soared

The chairman of the body which represents thousands of independent petrol stations has called for urgent discussions with ministers over Britain’s transport fuel crisis.

In a letter to Energy Secretary Ed Davey, Brian Madderson of the Retail Motor Industry Federation (RMI) predicted that fuel shortages caused by last week’s panic buying could continue until at least the Easter weekend and possibly beyond as petrol stations struggle to restock.

He also said the confidence of independent fuel retailers had been 'abruptly shaken' by the Government’s 'perceived inability' to manage the issue of a potential strike by tanker drivers.

'Beyond the pale': Edmund King, the president of the AA, accused garages of profiteering from the fuel panic

However, Allan Davison, divisional director of 
Hoyer, said he was 'very hopeful' a solution to the dispute would be 
found and the strike would be headed off.

'It’s not in anyone’s 
interest to have a strike - for ourselves, for the drivers, for the 
members of the public and everyone else - so we’re hopeful we can get to
 some sort of resolution,' he told ITV’s Daybreak programme.

He also offered assurance that plans had been made for coping if a strike did go ahead.

'It
 could be damaging but we along with other companies are looking at 
contingency plans,' he said, adding: 'We’re working with the military to get 
trained drivers in and that process at this point in time is working 
very well for us.'

The
 Highways Agency said tomorrow night – Maundy Thursday – and Easter 
Monday afternoon were likely to be the busiest over the Bank Holiday 
weekend, especially on the main holiday routes, as people set out and 
return from short breaks or day trips.

Drivers and rail passengers also face delays and disruption from roadworks and engineering works, though both highways and rail bosses say this will be less than usual as repair work has been lifted.

Several major rail routes will have restricted services, with engineering works taking place at London Liverpool Street and the main West Coast mainline shut at various times between Crewe, Liverpool or Preston and further north between Carlisle, Glasgow and Edinburgh.

But train bosses say there will be fewer instances of buses replacing trains on the rail network this Easter compared with last Easter.

On the roads, roadworks, lane restrictions and temporary speed limits will remain in place on 22 busy routes, including stretches of the M1 and M25.

Just the beginning: This was the scene on the M40 on the first day of the Easter Getaway at the weekend. The Highways Agency said tomorrow night and Easter Monday afternoon were likely to be the busiest over the Bank Holiday weekend

But the Highways Agency said it had completed or suspended 90 per cent of roadworks on England’s motorways and major A-roads.

Sites where roadworks will remain ‘for safety reasons’ include 22 miles of the M1 near Luton in Bedfordshire, an 11-mile stretch of the M25 near St Albans in Hertfordshire, 11 miles of the M4 near west London and 23 miles of the M62 near Leeds.

Traffic information company INRIX said motorists heading for the West Country were likely to face the worst delays. In one piece of good news for travellers, planned strikes by ground staff at Stansted Airport over Easter were called off after peace talks.
