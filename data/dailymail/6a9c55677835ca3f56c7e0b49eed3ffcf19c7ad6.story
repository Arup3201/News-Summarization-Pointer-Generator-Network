Gerry McCann has flown to join his wife Kate in Portugal in the hope he 
may give evidence in their libel case brought against a disgraced police
 chief.

Mr McCann had remained at home looking after the couple's 
twins while his wife attended the trial against the former policeman 
Goncalo Amaral, in Lisbon.

The heart specialist is now on his way to 
join his wife Kate, according to the family's spokesman Clarence 
Mitchell, and he hopes to give evidence against Amaral who the couple 
claim engulfed them in a ‘massive tidal wave of lies’ when he published a
 book on his thoughts on the Madeleine McCann investigation.

Lisbon: The heart specialist and his wife have accused the former Portuguese policeman of libelling them

Quoted in The Star, Mr Mitchell said last night: 'I can confirm Gerry McCann is hoping to give evidence.'

In his 2008 bombshell book, 'The Truth of Lies', Amaral claimed that Kate and Gerry McCann hid their daughter's body after a 
fatal accident at the family's Algarve holiday apartment. He said they 
staged her disappearance to cover up their negligence – accusations the 
McCanns vehemently deny.

The couple, from Rothley, Leicestershire, 
launched £1million libel proceedings against Mr Amaral, who was sacked 
as the head of the investigation after he launched an outspoken attack 
on British police.

They are also suing his book publishers and a TV station which broadcast an April 2009 documentary repeating Mr Amaral's claims.

The
 trial, which began earlier this month at Lisbon's civil court, has 
heard that Mrs McCann told friends she was ‘devastated’ by Amaral's 
book.

Their friend Susan Hubbard, the wife of an Anglican minister 
who counselled the McCanns after Madeleine’s disappearance from a 
holiday resort in Praia da Luz, told the court: ‘The thought that most 
people in Portugal thought Madeleine was dead was devastating for both 
Kate and Gerry – and the thought that was added, that they had something
 to do with it.’

Defamed? Kate McCann, pictured speaking to press outside Lisbon's civil court last week, has brought a case of libel against the former police chief in the country who she says launched a 'smear campaign' against her

Lie', which accuses her of staging her daughter's disappearance, despite
 a lack of evidence

Mrs McCann, a GP, cried as the court heard she was 
unable to eat and constantly wept in the days after Madeleine’s 
disappearance on May 3, 2007.

But Mrs Hubbard, 46, said Mrs McCann’s 
despair turned to ‘anger and surprise’ after the couple were named as 
arguidos – or suspects – by the Portuguese police.

Mr Amaral’s book, 
The Truth Of The Lie, was published three days after the Portuguese 
authorities formally closed the investigation in 2008 and cleared the 
couple as suspects.

The McCanns’ lawyer, Isabel Duarte, said it also contained claims that the family’s ‘Find Madeleine’ fund could be fraudulent.

The
 fund raised £2million in public donations and was used to pay for the 
search for Madeleine to continue after the Portuguese case was closed.

A
 private detective who worked for the fund said he received abuse 
instead of information after Mr Amaral’s book soured public opinion 
against the McCanns.

Skipton, Yorkshire, said the McCanns viewed Mr 
Amaral's book as a 'gross breach of confidentiality' because it showed 
he had been speaking to publishers while he and colleagues claimed laws 
on secrecy prevented them from discussing the Madeleine case with the 
couple.

The trial has also heard from Alan Pike, a trauma expert who 
has been helping the McCanns since Madeleine's May 3 2007 disappearance 
on the Algarve.

The told the court last week that Mrs McCann 
'referred to killing herself as an option to end the trauma she was 
experiencing' after the publication of the book.

The court also heard
 yesterday that the book fuelled internet trolls to incite 
conspiracy-theorists to plot to kidnap the couple's twins Sean and 
Amelie.

Close family friend Michael Wright told the court the 
theories in Mr Amaral's book gave conspiracy theorists on anti-Mccann 
Internet forums 'focus' because he had been in charge of the botched 
investigation into Madeleine's disappearance.

He said: 'There were 
several examples of them inciting forum members to abduct one of the 
twins as they felt they would be able to throw some light on what may 
have happened.

'On one of the Internet forums, called The 3 Arguidos,
 there was an Internet conversation in great length where a member was 
suggesting that someone should abduct Sean or Amelie because they may be
 able to get information out of them that would confirm Mr Amaral's 
theories.'

Mr Wright, who helped monitor Internet activity on missing
 Madeleine for the couple, said he felt compelled to tell Gerry and he 
was interviewed by police from his home county of North Yorkshire after 
they decided detectives should be alerted.

He said the threats also made Gerry and Kate more vigilant about the use of the Internet by their twins, now eight.

'I know Amelie has Googled her name and discovered sites to do with the conclusions of Mr Amaral's book,' he told the court.

'I do not know if she opened any of the pages and fortunately she told Gerry and Kate.

'But
 I know they will definitely be in a position where over the coming 
years they will search on the Internet and they will find people who 
will be saying their parents killed their sister.'

Amaral, 56, is denying defamation.

He
 insists everything he published in his book is already contained in 
police and court case files on Madeleine which have been made public - 
an argument disputed by the McCanns.

The case, due to finish hearing evidence in November, continues next Friday.

It
 is believed Kate's mother Susan Healy, cousin Michael Corner and 
Gerry's sister Bridget Cameron, known as Trish, will be called as 
witnesses.
