Buyers must first register on realAs before they can get a prediction on the app, which is completely free. 

Underquoting  has become rife in the industry, with agents using it as a way to attract lower end bidders to an auction.

Agents then hope that potential buyers will get caught up in the excitement of the event and bid well over their budget.  

Speaking to The Weekend Australian, RealAs Chief executive Josh Rowe expressed how his app wants to put some honesty back into the real estate business, however strict laws are preventing real justice for buyers. 

'From the point of view of the buyer, underquoting clearly wastes their time. They are spending a lot of money on research, appraisals, building and pest inspections, then they find that the property goes for way over the estimate,' Mr Rowe said.

According to data from the app, agents consistently underquote properties going to auction by up to 33 per cent

'Buyers are frustrated and angry… There are laws against it but the problem is that it is practically unenforceable.'  realAs was the brainchild of David Morrell, Australia's first buyers' agent.

David knew that it was buyers who decide how much they will pay for a property.

If buyers knew the sale price, it would even up the playing field and put an end up agen manipulations.  

Speaking to the Financial Review Mr Morrell said the he thought of the idea for the app while on a trip to George Mason University in Washington DC.

 'They had just come up with a predictive algorithm. At the time I was lamenting how hard it was to get the real price from estate agents. I asked the professors: 'Could this be adapted to predict real estate prices?' The answer was yes,' he said. 

Passionately talking about the realAs, Mr Morrell said: 'It's very clever and its going to be very disruptive. It will put underquoting to bed.'
