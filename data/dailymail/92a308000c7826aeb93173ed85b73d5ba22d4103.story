Australian journalist Peter Greste took to Twitter to express his sheer joy after being released from an Egyptian prison where he was held for over 400 days.

The 49-year-old Al Jazeera and ex-BBC journalist shared a photo of himself on a beach in Cyprus at about 9:30pm Australian time on Tuesday, with his arms thrown in the air and the caption: 'Free in Cyprus! Feels sweet. Peter back online for first time in 400+ days. Special thanks to Mike 4 [sic] nursing twitter'.

It was followed by a Tweet that confirmed Greste was on his way home: 'Brother Mike and I due to head home to Australia shortly. Can't wait for the family reunion.'

Freedom at last: Australian journalist Peter Greste, pictured on a beach in Cyprus on Tuesday, took to Twitter to express his sheer joy at being released from a Cairo Prison 

He was released from prison and deported on Sunday after a presidential 'approval'. The official and an Interior Ministry statement said he was released under a new deportation law passed last year

However a shadow of grief continues to underlie even the tweets of Greste, who continues to advocate for the release of his colleagues Canadian-Egyptian Mohamed Fahmy and Egyptian national Baher Mohamed.

'Special thanks to all who've supported us over the past year. MUST NOT FORGET THOSE STILL IN PRISON @Bahrooz #FreeAJStaff @MFFahmy11… Keep shouting #FreeAJStaff' he wrote.

The three men were sentenced to up to 10 years in jail in 2013 after being accused of helping the Muslim Brotherhood, an outlawed terrorist organisation, due to their coverage of the violent crackdown on Islamist protests following the military overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi.

Just prior to his first tweet in more than a year, a message on his account read: 'This is Mike who has been running Peter's twitter account since his arrest. A truly massive thank you to everyone who joined the campaign.

It was followed by a Tweet that confirmed Greste was on his way home and looking forward to seeing his family again

'Your contribution has been immense. I now gladly pass over the reins to @PeterGreste Freedom in Cypress!!'

Greste was released from prison and deported Sunday after a presidential 'approval,' according to an Egyptian prison official and the nation's official news agency. The official and an Interior Ministry statement said he was released under a new deportation law passed last year.  

Greste also used his first interview since being deported to call on Egypt to release the other detained journalists and reveal the trauma of leaving his colleagues behind in the Cairo prison.

The journalist said he didn't truly believe he was being freed until he was seated on a plane bound for Cyprus.

'You spend 400 days in such close proximity with people and you really get to know them very, very well,' the 49-year-old told Al Jazeera in Cyprus on Monday. 

Just prior to his first tweet in more than a year, these two tweets appeared on his account 

Greste appears in a defendants' cage in a courthouse near Tora prison in Cairo, Egypt in May last year. 

'So it was a very difficult moment walking out of that prison, saying goodbye to those guys, not knowing how much longer they will have to put up with this.'

Greste said even when driving to the airport on Sunday he wondered if his ordeal was really coming to end given there'd been other moments when freedom appeared imminent but was 'snatched away'.

'So I really didn't want to let myself believe it really was happening until I got my backside on a seat on the plane with my brother Mike and we knew, then, that for me at least, this is over.'

The Australian said the key to surviving jail had been to stay fit physically, mentally and spiritually.

Greste exercised by running, kept mentally fit by studying and remained spiritually strong through meditation.

'It was a way of enforcing a kind of discipline on myself and dealing with each day as it came,' he said.

'Hopefully ... I've come out of it not too damaged.'

The award-winning correspondent described his release as a massive step forward.

'I just hope that Egypt keeps going down this path with the others,' he said.

'If it's appropriate for me to be free it's right for all of them to be freed.' Greste wasn't expecting to be released ahead of a scheduled retrial.

However while running on Sunday the prison warden called him over and told him to pack his things.

'I said "What do you mean?" and he said "You're going" and I said "Where, to another prison?" and he said "No the (Australian) embassy is coming they'll be here in an hour".'

Greste said Monday that his freedom was something of a 'rebirth' and that key to his well-being while incarcerated for more than a year was exercising, studying and meditating

Greste said he is now looking forward to 'watching a few sunsets and the stars' and 'feeling the sand under my toes'.

Fahmy's relatives expect the Canadian-Egyptian to also be deported under a decree passed by Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi that allows for the transfer of foreigners on trial.

Canada said Greste's release was positive and it remained 'very hopeful' Fahmy would be freed soon.

Al Jazeera also vowed to pursue the campaign to free its other two journalists.

But Heather Allan, head of newsgathering at the channel, admitted she wasn't confident Mohamed, an Egyptian, would be released.

'(But) are we going to keep on fighting it? Absolutely,' she said.

'We are not going to leave him there.'

Mohamed's family has pinned their hopes on a presidential pardon or his acquittal on appeal.
