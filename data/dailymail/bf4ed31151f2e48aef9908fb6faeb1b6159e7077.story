More than £340million worth of songs were illegally downloaded in the  UK in the first half of 2012, research revealed yesterday.

Millions of Britons are breaking the law rather than paying for music, evidence from the Digital Music Index by analysts Musicmetric has shown.

The data suggests that the blocking of Pirate Bay – a file-sharing website – earlier this year, has had little impact on an industry worth £1.2billion a year in exports alone.

Slowing market: Record labels recognise that the illegal download business is damaging to their sales

Albums by Ed Sheeran and Rihanna were among the most popular downloads

People looking to download music for free have instead turned to BitTorrent, a network where tunes can be obtained speedily, but mostly  illegally, from other users.

The sample also reveals how tastes – and the willingness to break the law – differ by region, providing record labels with useful information about file-sharing patterns among consumers.

Manchester topped the list of most illegal downloads per capita, with 1.3m in six months, closely followed by Nottingham and Southampton, while London came 20th.

The most popular downloads were albums by pop idols Ed Sheeran, Rizzle Kicks and Rihanna, although in retiree hotspot Bournemouth the most popular record was The Discography of the Eagles.

Matt Mason, executive director at 
BitTorrent which offers legal downloads but is frequently misused, said: 'Knowing what people are downloading and where is incredibly valuable to labels and artists.

‘It’s short-sighted to think that we can simply tell people to stop and they will,’ he added.

Record labels recognise that although the illegal download business is damaging to their sales, there is also the potential to capitalise on the massive online fan base, whether through tours, advertising or sponsorship.

Chief executive of Musicmetric, Gregory Mead, said: ‘Knowing exactly where your fans are has long been a holy grail for record labels.

‘Understanding what drives them to engage will be vital to helping the industry prosper again soon.

'The challenge for copyright holders is to find ways to monetise music files torrented online.'
