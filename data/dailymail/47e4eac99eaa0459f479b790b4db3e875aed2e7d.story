Praying for salvation? Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi resorted to Facebook

Silvio Berlusconi logged on to Facebook yesterday to insist he will not quit as Italian prime minister.

Rumours swirled around Rome that the billionaire was about to yield to pressure from EU leaders for a coalition government to step in to embrace tough austerity measures.

Brussels is accused of masterminding 'coups d'etat' to keep the single currency together, with Greek leader George Papandreou having been seen off after he proposed giving his people a vote on an EU bailout package.

There are growing fears that debt contagion is spreading across the Continent, threatening to engulf Italy's economy and sending shockwaves across Europe.

Mr Berlusconi, who is facing a crunch budget vote in the Italian parliament this afternoon, went online to say he was staying where he was.

The 75-year-old wrote: 'Reports of my resignation are completely unfounded and I don't know where they have come from.'

He took to the social network site after leaving the Italian capital for a 'prearranged appointment', which turned out to be a meeting with members of his family at their luxury villa at Arcore near Milan – the venue for his infamous 'bunga bunga' sex parties.

Last night, Mr Berlusconi added another comment to his Facebook page, saying: 'Let's go forward, we must be ready to fight because if there were an unelected left-wing revolution against the government that would be the opposite of democracy.'

As dozens of government MPs threatened to defect, the Italian leader told the centre-right newspaper Libero that those who abandoned him were traitors.

'I'll propose a confidence vote. I want to see who tries to betray me,' he declared.

Earlier, Giuliano Ferrara, editor of the newspaper Il Foglio and a close friend of Mr Berlusconi, said the leader was on the brink: 'The fact that Berlusconi is about to step down is given as read, it is just a question of time, maybe even minutes.'

Italy is the third biggest economy in 
the eurozone and its political woes and debt worries are seen as a huge
threat in the wider crisis facing the single currency.

Berlusconi's latest assurance over 
his majority may be bad news for Italian bonds, which sold off again on 
Friday to push their yield to a record euro-era high above 6.4 per 
cent.

It demonstrated that investors were steering clear of lending to the debt-plagued nation and increasing the likelihood of Silvio Berlusconi accepting a bail-out .

He is currently under intense external pressure to
end months of procrastination over structural reforms and measures to 
cut Italy's 1,900billion euro public debt.

The spread over 
German bunds, reflecting the higher risk premium investors place on 
Italy, also hit a record above 4.6 percentage points.

Bond
prices would recover and the yield spread would fall by a full 
percentage point if the government should fall, according to a Reuters 
survey of 10 fund managers, market analysts and strategists last week.

Economy
Minister Giulio Tremonti was forced to deny reports that he had 
forecast a 'catastrophe' on financial markets next week unless 
Berlusconi stepped down.

European
Central Bank council member Yves Mersch underscored Italy's high stakes
on Sunday, saying the ECB frequently debates the option of ending 
its purchases of Italian bonds unless Rome delivers on reforms.

Without that bond-buying program, the run on Italian bonds would probably already have spiralled way out of control.

Rebel MPs have threatened to desert 
him in large numbers in this afternoon's vote on Italy's accounts for 
last year – an occasion which should be routine but is being seen as a 
crucial test of his strength.

Mr
Berlusconi, who is his country's longest-serving post-war leader, is 
said to have the support of only around 300 out of 630 MPs, and if he is
defeated it is very likely he will resign. Fresh elections would be 
held in January, a year earlier than planned.

EU leaders are determined to have a 
technocratic government in Rome, just as they have done in Athens, 
despite growing unease about the implications for democracy and the 
concept of sovereign nation states.

Mr Berlusconi has already been forced 
to accept that officials from the International Monetary Fund and the EU
will be drafted in to oversee the chaotic public finances.

However, the think tank Open Europe 
said in a report Italy will need at least £700billion over the next 
three years just to stand still.

Yesterday the nation's borrowing costs soared to their highest level since the euro was created.

The yield, or interest rate, on 
ten-year Italian government bonds leapt to a punishing 6.66 per cent. 
Economists say 7 per cent would make a bailout unavoidable.

'The current feeling is that Italy is 
too large to bail out with the current mechanisms in place, should 
Greek-like turmoil spread to Italy,' said Peter O'Flanagan of Clear 
Currency.

Mr Berlusconi's fate appeared to have 
been sealed at a Brussels summit late last month.

Asked at a joint press
conference whether he could sort out Italy's economic difficulties, 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Nicolas Sarkozy 
exchanged glances and laughed – a moment that triggered outrage even 
among Mr Berlusconi's critics at home.

David Cameron insisted last night the eurozone will get no help from the rest of the world until it puts its own house in order.

Britain's impatience with Germany's 
refusal to put its taxpayers' money behind an economic rescue package 
appears to be reaching boiling point following the failure of last 
week's crunch G20 summit.

Mrs Merkel is refusing to allow Bundesbank 
gold reserves to fund an expansion of a eurozone bailout fund, or to 
countenance the European Central Bank doing more to prop up the 
splintering single currency.

'It is for the eurozone and the ECB to
support the euro, and global action cannot be a substitute for concrete
action by the eurozone,' said Mr Cameron.

Labour leader Ed Miliband accused the 
Prime Minister of favouring a policy of 'collective austerity' rather 
than trying to foster growth as a solution to the economic crisis.

Loud and clear: Russia foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has said his country would not be willing to lend directly to the eurozone, preferring to channel any support through the IMF

Russia, holder of the world's third largest forex reserves, today delivered a vote of no confidence in Europe's approach to resolving its sovereign debt crisis.

It came as the head of the International Monetary Fund visited Moscow to seek support.               

Without directly referring to the eurozone's bailout fund, foreign minister Sergei Lavrov made it clear Russia would not be willing to lend directly to it, preferring to channel any support through the IMF.              

He added that this was the joint position of the so-called BRICS caucus of emerging markets nations that have accumulated trillions of dollars in foreign reserves to insure against external shocks.

He told a press conference: 'Our countries are ready to take part in joint efforts, including the provision of credits, under those rules and channels that exist in the International Monetary Fund.'

Lavrov said that, in return for financial assistance, emerging markets wanted earlier agreements on 'deep reform' to the IMF and the global financial system to be implemented.

Lavrov spoke before Christine Lagarde, making her first visit to Moscow since taking over as managing director of the Fund, met President Dmitry Medvedev at the Kremlin.

Medvedev made no substantial comment at a photo-opportunity with Lagarde, who also made no comment.

She was due to give a speech later today, meet Finance Ministry and central bank officials, and hold a news conference tomorrow.

It was not clear whether Lagarde would meet Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, the senior partner in Russia's ruling 'tandem' who has announced he will run for the presidency next year.           

Putin was hosting a meeting of a regional security group in St Petersburg attended by Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao.
