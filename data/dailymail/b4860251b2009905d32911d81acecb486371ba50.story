An 18-year-old woman who arrived in Queensland from west Africa has again tested negative for Ebola and has returned home.

'The patient has undergone a second round of testing and results show that she does not have Ebola Virus Disease,' a statement from Queensland Health said on Wednesday.

The woman has been discharged from the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital.

A Queensland Health spokeswoman told AAP the 18-year-old woman confirmed the young woman will complete the 21-day incubation period for Ebola at home.

Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young, pictured here in 2009, confirmed the young woman will complete the 21-day incubation period for Ebola at home and is expected to return to normal life mid-week

She's expected to return to normal life mid-next week.

She was taken to hospital on Saturday night after coming down with a fever.

On Monday she tested negative for Ebola, but remained in isolation until her second test also confirmed that she was clear of the virus. 

The woman moved to Australia from Guinea about 15 days ago with eight members of her extended family and immediately went into home isolation.

She  was one of 19 people from four African families who agreed to go into home isolation earlier this month, after travelling to Queensland from parts of west Africa ravaged by the deadly virus.

Staff were checking the family's health daily and on Saturday night the 18-year-old developed a fever

Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young said Queensland had been aware of the family's arrival, and the woman, two other adults, and six children had not come into contact with anyone since being in Australia.  

The 18-year-old is the third person in Queensland to have been tested for Ebola.

Earlier on Wednesday, Queensland Premier Campbell Newman said all people arriving in Australia from Ebola-affected countries should be tested for the disease regardless of their symptoms. 

Thousands of people have already died from the virus in West African nations such as Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia 

Mr Newman wrote to Immigration Minister Scott Morrison requesting new measures be taken to protect the country from Ebola.

The premier called for quarantine workers to test all passengers coming from Ebola-affected areas for the disease within 24 hours of their arrival.

He said travellers coming from Ebola zones should have to give their contact details and their temperature recordings to quarantine officers.

Mr Newman said within 24 hours of their arrival they should undergo comprehensive Ebola assessments.

Australia is yet to confirm a single Ebola case, but the Queensland government has been talking about the looming threat and its actions to protect against it nearly daily. 

This is the second scare this month after Cairns nurse Sue Ellen Kovack returned from Sierre Leone exhibiting symptoms.

She had been working as a volunteer treating patients but was later cleared of having the potentially deadly virus.  

The teenager is doing 'very well' and she and her family have been 'very responsible'
