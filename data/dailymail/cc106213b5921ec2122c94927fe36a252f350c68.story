A Massachusetts lawyer is concerned that it will be difficult to find impartial jurors for an upcoming murder trial given his client’s unique appearance, namely, implanted horns and a satanic tattoo.

Caius Veiovis, 33, is the third suspect to face trial in the August 2011 slayings of David Glasser, Edward Frampton and Robert Chadwell.

Veiovis' signature look includes two rows of bumps resembling horns protruding from his forehead, a ‘666’ tattoo between them, and other facial and neck tattoos. He also had surgically altered the shape of his ears to make them elf-like. 

Serious charges: Caius Veiovis, 33, is facing kidnapping and murder charges in the torture, killing and dismemberment of three men in 2011

Scary: The suspect's attorney is concerned his 'unique appearance' could prejudice potential jurors

Inspired by the occult: The 33-year-old has 3D horns implanted into his forehead, a 666 tattoo and additional body art on his face and neck, as well as surgically altered 'elf' ears 

After discussing the matter, a Hampden Superior Court judge on Thursday told defense lawyer James Reardon Jr. he would ask potential jurors if there was anything about the Veiovis’ appearance that would keep them from being fair.

The trial is scheduled to start September 3. Veiovis has pleaded not guilty to counts of murder, kidnapping and witness intimidation.

The heavily inked man is accused of helping David Chalue and Adam Lee Hall kidnap, torture, murder and dismember David Glasser, Edward Frampton and Robert Chadwell in Berkshire County on August 28, 2011.

The victims' mutilated remains were later found in a ditch in Becket, Masslive.com reported. 

According to investigators, the co-conspirators killed Glasser because he was expected to testify against Hall, a member of the Hell’s Angels biker gang, in an unrelated assault case.

Defense lawyer James Reardon Jr brought up his client's appearance out of concern that it could influence the outcome of the trial

The two other men were murdered because they witnessed Glasser’s abduction.

Adam Hall, 37, was convicted in February of first-degree murder and kidnapping, and sentenced to three consecutive life terms, plus 42 years.

Chalue also has been found guilty and sentenced to three consecutive life terms in prison for his role in the triple homicide.

During the pre-trial hearing Thursday, Veiovis’ attorney asked the presiding judge to move the trial to a different location due to publicity, but his motion was denied.

'There's a serious factor of curiosity and concern when the jury first sees him,’ James Reardon Jr said in Hampden Superior Court.

The lawyer then brought up the issue of his client's appearance out of concern that jurors may find it challenging to be impartial because of the horns and tattoos.

‘I think we have to get it out there,’ the lawyer stated.

Berkshire District Attorney David Capeless responded that he was not planning to parse through the meanings of the body art, or try ‘to connect them to the charges.’
