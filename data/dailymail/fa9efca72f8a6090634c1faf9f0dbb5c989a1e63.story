The two young women snapped in risque positions with the 71-year-old owner of the Dallas Cowboys say they were too drunk to remember what happened that night.

The women, Lindzie and Jordan — whom TMZ claims are strippers in Houston and Forth Worth, respectively — have contacted their own lawyers out of fear that the married billionaire, Jerry Jones, will go after them in court.

'There was a lot of alcohol involved,' the women told TMZ, denying that they had anything to do with leaking the photos or being a part of an extortion plot against Jones.

Racy: A man who is alleged to be Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones is seen fondling a much-younger woman in a picture that surfaced last weekend. The 71-year-old has been married for 50 years

Blackmail? The photos were released by a Dallas man who says they were taken to extort Jones. Above, another shot that allegedly shows Jones with a woman who is not his wife

The photos, which were published last 
weekend in a strange 20-page manifesto attributed to a Dallas 
'entrepreneur,' claim to show Jones grabbing one blonde woman's breasts some five years ago.

In another shot,
a brunette woman on her knees grins as she leans her head against the man's
pelvic area.

The man who published the photos, that have appeared in several publications including the Huffington Post, claims they were taken by someone else to extort Jones, who is worth an estimated $2.7billion.

Jones has not yet issued a statement on the pictures.

Despite their poses, the women told TMZ that a third friend snapped the pictures and that neither of them had noticed photos were being taken.

The women deny that they wanted the pics to go public.

Jones appears to be in a restroom with both women in the two pictures.

The photos are potentially especially scandalous considering Jones has been married to his 72-year-old wife Gene for 50 years.

They have three adult children 
together: sons Stephen and Jerry Jr and a daughter Charlotte. All three 
of their children work for the Dallas Cowboys company and the couple 
have nine grandchildren.

Jones is described as a 'dedicated businessman and family man' on the Cowboy's official website.

The photos emerged in
connection with a manifesto posted online titled 'Uncovering the Truth' which
has 'For: Jerry Jones' written on the cover.  A link to the  report was  tweeted to several news outlets on August 3.

According to the
manifesto, the pictures were taken by a different person to blackmail
Jones, but the manifesto strays into theories about numerology and he also calls
himself the 'Son of God'. 

Sources told Deadspin that the man who tweeted the link to the report 'used to be fairly well connected in Dallas' and would often attend parties with Cowboys and Mavericks players. 

What were they doing? Another image released online doesn't include Jones, but appears to show the woman he grabbed in one of the other photos
