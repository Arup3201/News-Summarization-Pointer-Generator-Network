An amateur historian has unearthed the identities of the men who captured top Nazi Heinrich Himmler - discovering that one of them was his own grandfather. 

Chris Mannion, 52, found old military papers which show his grandfather Lieutenant Sergeant Patrick Mannion caught Adolf Hitler's right-hand man.

The evil Nazi was then the world's most wanted man and is known to have been found by a unit of four British and two Russian soldiers as he tried to flee Germany in 1945.

Himmler, who was one of the men responsible for the Holocaust and was head of the SS, was wearing an eye patch disguise and carrying a bag of money when he was captured.

He was taken to a checkpoint, quizzed and moved to a camp where he was identified  - before killing himself. 

The names of his arresting officers has always been known but the four British men who first found him - from 196 Battery of the 73rd Anti-tank Regiment - had been shrouded in mystery.

Mr Mannion, from Manchester, says he discovered who the men were when researching his grandfather's military career.

He spent £30 accessing military service records of his grandfather - who he knew had served with 196 Battery.

But he was stunned to find the records show Lt Sgt Patrick Mannion was one of the men who found Himmler.

An arrest report he was sent shows Himmler was picked up by one non-commissioned officer and three gunners.

Mr Mannion says the documents show they were Gunner John Fletcher, Gunner Michael Faye, Gunner N Carlston and his own grandfather.

The official records show one of the men fired a shot before Faye grabbed Himmler - and the group led him to the checkpoint.

Mr Mannion now plans to publish the records and his findings in an upcoming book about Himmler's capture - and the men who found him.

He said: 'As a young boy I looked up to him for being a soldier, and would play with his medals and bits and pieces he brought back from the war.

'I never knew what he had done in the war, I was always curious, but no one could tell me for certain.

'In the end I set out to find out myself. There was a rumour in the family about a high-ranking Nazi official but I didn't think in a million years I would find out anything like this.

'I decided to get his service records, paid £30, and was sent 2,600 pages. They had the records of the capture of Himmler - and there was my grandfather's name.'

When Himmler received the news of Hitler's death, he travelled to Flensburg where he remained for the first week of May.

On May 15, 1945 he dismissed his staff and left with his two companions for a hide-out in the Harz Mountains.

The three men set out on foot, moving across country, seeking cover in the woods, and sleeping in sheds or haystacks.

Himmler's group were stopped on several occasions but managed to bluff their way through, until they tried to cross through Meinstedt on May 21.

When they were about to travel through Meinstedt they were surprised by a British patrol of the four men from 196 Battery.

They tried to evade capture but, after warning shots were fired, they stopped to be searched, taken to a military checkpoint and detained.

Over the following two days, Himmler was moved to several camps and then the headquarters of the Second British Army in Lüneburg, south of Hamburg, where he admitted who he was.

A doctor tried to examine him but Himmler bit into a cyanide pill he had concealed, collapsing and dying shortly afterwards.

Mr Mannion's documents showed that his grandfather fought in Normandy, Belgium, Holland and Germany.

He landed in Normandy the day after D-Day, and was also involved in peacekeeping after the war, routinely patrolling Germany arresting fleeing Germans and preventing further unrest.

According to the files, it was on one such patrol that Lt Sgt Mannion and three other members of his patrol stumbled across the group of Germans, who were acting suspiciously.

The report reads: 'On 21 May 45, at about 1930 hrs, one of the patrols which the Regt sent out daily to neighbouring villages, saw three men emerging from a wood, at Meinstedt.

'The patrol hailed the men, and when they failed to stop, fired a warning shot.

'The three men then approached. As they held no allied release permits, the serjeant in charge of the patrol sent them back by truck.'

The amateur historian said: 'The report says that Himmler was in disguise with an eye patch, having grown a beard.

'What gave it away was his papers were just too correct, they were brand new, and he also had a bag stuffed full of money, it's all in the report.

'He had two men with him, who were obviously SS, and they knew Himmler wasn't who he said he was, so they handed him over.'

Mr Mannion, who never met his grandfather, added: 'I was proud of him anyway, for going to fight for his country as millions did, but this is just the icing on the cake.

'It took me a few weeks just to take it in, all the pictures of Himmler now I can't see it in the same way, because my granddad caught him.

'When you see the records you realise they did momentous things, it's really something to be proud of. It's made me feel closer to my grandfather. I'm in awe of him.'

Lt Sgt Mannion died in in 1948 following complications of injuries sustained in the war.

The son of a school teacher, Heinrich Himmler was born in Munich on October 7, 1900, and went on to become the architect of the Holocaust and one of the Nazi party's most dreadful chiefs.

His first involvement with the Nazis was in 1923, and he was their propaganda leader between 1926 and 1930. He was made head of the S.S. - the Schutzstaffel - a major  organisation and Adolf Hitler's personal bodyguard, which became one of the most powerful organisations under his leadership during the Third Reich. Himmler developed it from a 290-man battalion to a huge group with its own military.

He became president of the Gestapo (Secret State Police) once the Nazis had come to power in 1933, and set up the very first Nazi concentration camp, Dachau, the same year.

Himmler was obsessed with the idea of the Germans as the Aryan race and racial purification and encouraged Aryans to only breed with each other in special programmes he set up. 

During the Second World War, after Hitler had successfully invaded Poland, he was able to force more than a million Poles and 300,000 Jews out of the west of the country.

In 1941, Himmler was present at the shooting of 100 Jews by firing squad in Minsk. He deciding that having to witness such killings might affect the mental health of his S.S. men, and declared that alternative methods of genocide be found. 

In 1942 he was charged with control of 'the final solution to the Jewish problem' - the Holocaust. He was given control of the concentration camps, including Auschwitz, and by spring that year it was greatly expanded to include gas chambers. In total, close to six million Jews were killed by the Nazis during the Holocaust. 

When it became clear that the Nazis were going to lose the war, Himmler attempted to bargain with the Allies, and Hitler consequently stripped him of all his duties. After the surrender he used a fake identity to try and escape, but was captured.

He committed suicide while being held by the allied forces on May 23, 1945, by swallowing a cyanide capsule.
