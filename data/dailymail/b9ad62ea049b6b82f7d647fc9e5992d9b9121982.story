While the majority of the country ate Christmas dinner and drank far too much on Christmas Day, Keegan Brown was hard at work between 8am and 4pm.

The 22-year-old was sifting through thousands of bottles for the NHS Foundation Trust he works for on the Isle of Wight — a complete contrast from a week ago when he spectacularly knocked out the three-time world champion John Part on the opening night of the William Hill PDC World Darts Championship.

‘I’m a lab assistant,’ explained Brown. ‘And every single specimen that is produced on the island has to go between me and 12 people first.

'It is a busy job, sorting out between 1,500 and 2,000 specimens a day for the right department. I receive everything — you name it, I have seen it.

‘Blood, urine. I have seen toes, hands, spleens. After checking them, they are given to the scientists.

‘The job is brilliant. Working Christmas Day and Boxing Day keeps my feet on the ground. 

'Working makes you more eager. It makes you hungrier to knock the work on the side and become more of a professional.’

And after knocking out Part last week Brown will give two-time world champion Adrian Lewis a formidable challenge on Sunday night.

Brown was named after the former Newcastle United manager Kevin Keegan by his football-loving dad.

Funnily enough, though, despite his famous name, he dislikes watching the game. ‘My dad is a Geordie but my family moved from the North East,’ he said.

‘Summer on the Isle of Wight is about 30 degrees and in Durham it’s 15! My mum is from the island and when I was six months old we moved there. 

'My dad worked on the original structure of St Mary’s Hospital back in 1988, where I am now working as a lab assistant. It is all a bit of a tale.’
