Daigo Smith is the first to admit he's tried online dating, which in itself ought to be enough to wipe the last oily layer of taboo off the subject.

An affable and ambitious former media man who owns his own personal training company and boasts a pair of dimples you could crack walnuts in, the east London entrepreneur speaks frankly about how hard it is for busy singletons to find like-minded souls in this seething metropolis of choice.

There's too much choice, Smith feels, and it's not all very good. Especially when it comes to online dating. Disillusioned, Smith and his business partner David Standen set about creating a dating website of their own.

The catch is, not all of you will be 
allowed on. You can only join Loveflutter (named for that 'butterflies in the stomach' feeling, according to Smith) if you're 'interesting' enough, and 
whether you are is determined by a multiple choice test.

Questions
 range from 'how many languages do you speak?' to 'would you parachute 
jump?' and 'if you were in a band would you be backing singer, guitarist
 or lead vocals?'.

'We
 want to connect similar people who are interesting and adventurous and 
confident,' Smith told MailOnline. 'So we teamed up with Dr Simon Moore, a chartered psychologist, to decide what makes someone 
"interesting", and came up with the questions.'

Loveflutter is highly gamified and only lets people join if they are proved to be 'interesting' enough through an online quiz

Loveflutter uses the Google Knowledge Graph you to connect with similar people in your area

If you do make the cut, the hyper-gamified dating site is colourful and fun, and Loveflutter's unique selling point is that it uses the Google Knowledge Graph to match people who not only share identical interests, but also those who share similar interests.

Creators say: 'Forget about those cheesy one-liners 
and silly ice-breakers, we match you with people who share the same 
interests as you, so you can share some great times together and chat 
about things you both love.'

Are you interesting enough to make the Loveflutter cut and find yourself on a date?

'Where other dating websites fall down is that you can only match with someone if you've ticked the exact same boxes or mentioned the exact same films,' explained Smith.

'On Loveflutter, if you say you like 
Pulp Fiction, the site will also bring up people who like Quentin 
Tarantino, and even those who like Reservoir Dogs.'

The site picks your interests from Facebook, but also allows you to add or delete your own on your Loveflutter page.

And as well as the Knowledge Graph, Loveflutter use Foursquare to link people on dates: once you've found someone you like, the 'suggest-a-date' button picks up your location and theirs and enables you to suggest via message a place equidistant from both points.

Smith and Standen say: 'We think we're the best dating site in London for people looking for some fun loving times and people searching for single Londoners who are into the same kind of stuff.

'We're not a dating agency, we're an online match maker, whether you're dating in Shoreditch, dating in Islington, dating in Clapham, dating in Notting Hill, dating in East London, dating in Central London, dating in North London, dating in West London or dating in South London.'

The dating start-up launch today across the UK and America, with memberships ranging from free to pay-as-you-go to Â£29.99 per month, depending on how much access you want.

Creators say Loveflutter is intended to put the fun back into dating
