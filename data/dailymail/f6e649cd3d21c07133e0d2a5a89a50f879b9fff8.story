Labour councillor Anita Ward tweeted in support of the Je Suis Charlie marchers - but accidentally added added her support for the terrorists

A former Lord Mayor of Birmingham has apologised after accidentally tweeting a hashtag in support of the Charlie Hebdo killers.

Labour councillor Anita Ward, who is also the Birmingham County Royal British Legion chairman, tweeted in support of the Je Suis Charlie marchers on Sunday - but then accidentally added her support for the  terrorists who killed 17 people in Paris last week.

She wrote: 'Thoughts are in Paris with all those marching in unity for #JeSuisCharlie but don't foget #JeSuisKouachi #JeSuisAhmed & Others.' 

#JeSuisKouachi is being used on social media by people supporting the massacres.

In a rush to upload the Tweet, Cllr Ward did not realise her mistake until she started receiving 'vile' replies on the social media site.

An audibly upset Cllr Ward today told MailOnline: 'It was literally down to carelessness on my part.

'When I started typing #JeSuis suggestions automatically came up, and I accidentally pressed the wrong one - I didn't even realise what I had done it until I started getting some really vile tweets back.

'I apologised immediately. I couldn't believe it. If I could take it back and undo it, I would. 

'All I can do is keep apologising, I wasn't paying attention and no one can beat me up more about that than me. It was a genuine, genuine mistake.  

'I can take people criticising me, I deserve that. But some of the vileness, it's just been unnecessary.

'I've deleted my account, it was a stupid mistake. I've learnt my lesson and in future I won't be using it.

'It's been a tough couple of days.' 

Some took to the social media site and called for her immediate sacking, despite her immediate apology.

One of the replies she received said: 'Just when you thought #Labour couldn't be more vile, they ask you to remember the poor terrorists killed in Paris...'

Cllr Ward has repeatedly apologised for her use of the hashtag, but has been forced to delete her account

Cllr Ward is a staunch supporter of the British forces and is also Birmingham's official Veterans' Champion

She deleted the tweet almost immediately and apologised as she came under fire before deleting her account.

Cllr Ward is a staunch supporter of the British forces and is also Birmingham's official Veterans' Champion.

Her son was shot by the Taliban while serving with the Irish Guards in Afghanistan five years ago.

Cllr Ward told the Birmingham Mail: 'I get it and I am sorry. Most of all to the families of those killed and to my son who was injured in Afghanistan fighting these type of people.'

She told the paper her use of the hashtag was a genuine mistake in a moment of carelessness.

'I didn't even see them [the hashtags] come up,' she added. 'I obviously wasn't paying attention and have learned my lesson not to press 'send' in a rush.

'I apologise for any offence caused.'

Some people took to Twitter to support Cllr Ward, and showed how auto-complete settings on Twitter throw up linked or similar phrases, with the #JeSuisCharlie message followed by #JeSuisKouachi and #JeSuisAhmed.

Former Birmingham Conservative councillor Philip Parkin said: 'It's very easy to make a mistake on here.

'You've deleted and apologised. End of.' 

#JeSuisAhmed has been used by thousands as way of paying tribute to dead Muslim police officer Ahmed Merabet, after he was gunned down in Paris.

The celebration of Mr Merabet, who was killed at point blank range by suspected Islamic fanatics, echoes the 'JeSuisCharlie' (I am Charlie) demonstrations that have swept the world in the wake of last week's shocking massacre.

The incident also comes after a Fox News pundit who claimed that Birmingham is closed to non-Muslims sparked a comic backlash as web users took to Twitter to mock the outlandish statement. 

The controversy originated when Mr Emerson, a self-styled expert on terrorism, was participating in a Fox News discussion in the wake of the attacks on Charlie Hebdo's office in Paris.

'In Britain, it's not just no-go zones,' he claimed. 'There are actual cities like Birmingham that are totally Muslim where non-Muslims just simply don't go in.' 

The pundit later apologised for his blunder - just 22 per cent of the city's residents are Muslim, compared to 46 per cent describing themselves as Christian - but could not stop the bemused reaction.

Among those criticising Mr Emerson were Prime Minister David Cameron, who said yesterday: 'When I heard this, frankly I choked on my porridge. This guy is clearly a complete idiot.'
