West Ham's stars helped spread some Christmas cheer on Tuesday afternoon as captain Kevin Nolan led a hospital visit to a children's ward in east London.

Just a stone's throw away from the Hammers' Upton Park home, Nolan was one of eight first-team players from Sam Allardyce's squad to hand out festive goodie bags containing games, mini-footballs, towels and much more to young patients on the Rainbow Ward at Newham University Hospital.

Nurses and hospital staff were equally delighted as they posed for photographs and got autographs from Nolan, James Tomkins, James Collins, Stewart Downing, Mauro Zarate, Diego Poyet, Matt Jarvis and Alex Song.

Defender Tomkins said he and his team-mates were aware of how difficult the holiday season can be for those who cannot be at home for Christmas.

'It's a time of year I enjoy coming to see the kids and being very humble, as some of them are really ill and you just hope they can get home in time for Christmas,' he said.

'Spending time with family is what it's all about at this time of year, so it keeps your feet on the ground when you know there are kids out there going through a tough time.

'We just wish them all well and hope they get home and spend Christmas in front of the tree, which is where everyone wants to be. I have got a fairly big family and I can obviously relate to seeing the mums and dads here with their kids in hospital, which is not the ideal place they want to be.

'All the lads have been really positive and given them some nice West Ham treats for Christmas, so hopefully we have puts some smiles on faces.'

The Hammers, meanwhile, will be looking to maintain their fine form when they host the Premier League's bottom side Leicester on Saturday.

Allardyce's side are unbeaten in their last five games and sit high in fourth place, just three points behind Manchester United.
