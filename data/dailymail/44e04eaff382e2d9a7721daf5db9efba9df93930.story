A first grade student was forced to go hungry after being denied a school meal by a lunch lady who told him 'guess what? You can't have a lunch.'

The seven-year-old, known only as Xavier, is part of a free lunch program and lined up as normal to eat at Cascade View Elementary School in Snohomish County in Washington last month.

But when it was his turn to receive his sack lunch, he was told he wasn't allowed.

Seven-year-old Xavier, who was told he wasn't allowed lunch despite being on a free school meals programme at Cascade View Elementary School in Washington state 

He claims that the lunch lady told him 'guess what? You can't have lunch.'

He was then handed a slip saying he had a negative lunch balance.

Now his father Eric has said he is thinking of removing his children from the school and is angry about the way his son has been treated.

Xavier said he waited his turn to be given a sack lunch but was then told by a lunch lady 'guess what? You can't have lunch' 

He added that his children's lunch balances should always be covered as they are entitled to food stamps and state funding.

He told Q13Fox.com: My question was never answered as to why he was denied. I was very mad. I couldn't believe it happened.

'It happened to me as a child and I could still feel that hurt and I can only imagine what he went through.

The boy's father Eric, pictured with his son, says he is angry that Xavier was forced to go hungry and is thinking of removing his children from the school 

'That’s like saying, ‘Hey, you don’t have your book bag so you can’t have your education’. They need to concentrate. They can’t concentrate without eating. '

The Snohomish County School District told the channel that they were looking into the incident.

A school spokesman added that even if a student's lunch balance goes below negative $20 or more they will still receive a cheese sandwich as well as a drink and unlimited fruit and vegetables.
