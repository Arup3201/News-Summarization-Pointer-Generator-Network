One of the two teens charged for the brutal bludgeoning to death of a WWII veteran in Spokane, Washington, has made the astonishing claim that he was buying crack cocaine from the 88-year-old and that the deal turned violent.

The bizarre allegation that war hero Delbert 'Shorty' Belton was a drug dealer emerged during 16-year-old Kenan Adams-Kinard's first court appearance yesterday where he was charged with first-degree murder and first-degree robbery.

Relatives of Belton derided Adams-Kinard's claims, calling them desperate and saying that Belton was senile, eccentric in his old age, but certainly not a crack cocaine user or pusher.

'That's a bunch of crock,' Belton's daughter-in-law Barbara Belton said to NBC News. 'Of course these kids are going to make excuses.'

Dark past: Adams-Kinard was convicted of third-degree theft and fourth-degree assault in June

Adams-Kinard and Demetrius Glenn, who are both 16, have been charged with battering 88-year-old Battle of Okinawa veteran Belton to death with flashlights in his car outside his Eagles lodge on Wednesday after a botched robbery.

Both were charged as adults and both have previous convictions for assault and were caught on security cameras in the area at the time of the killing.

Glenn gave himself up immediately to the police, but Adams-Kinard went on the run for four-days and allegedly told friends during his time in hiding that the beating occurred because of a drug deal gone wrong.

Police have said that they have a letter in their possession, written by Adams-Kinard to his mother, in which he claims that Belton was selling them crack cocaine.

The letter said that after purchasing a 'zip of crack cocaine from Shorty,' the teens 'proceeded to sock him.'

'I took his wallet and another ounce 
of crack from his pockets,' the letter said, according to the court 
document. 'He was unconscious so I made sure he was still breathing, and
then I took off.'

Police 
have said that they seriously doubt Adams-Kinard's story and 
spokeswoman, Monique Cotton said in a statement: 'We have no evidence to
support that.'

Even 
Glenn's lawyer, Christian Phelps, told NBC News that he was skeptical 
and said, 'It doesn't seem plausible to me. I wouldn't put any stock in 
it at this point.'

However, Phelps also pointed out that, 'there are no eyewitnesses and no forensic evidence that links either of the kids to the crime.'

Yesterday, upon the apprehension of Adams-Kinard, police revealed the sickening brutality inflicted on the helpless 88-year-old victim.

Attacked in his car on Wednesday in the parking lot of Eagles lodge, Delbert Belton was found wedged between the two front seats of his car on Wednesday and was battered so badly he sustained brain damage and had lost too much blood to survive the violent attack.

Kenan Adams-Kinard and Demetrius Glenn, both 16, are accused of battering the war hero to death with flashlights after he fought back during a robbery and according to Belton's daughter-in-law 'They just kept hitting and hitting him.'

'He was an 88-year-old man,' said Barabara Belton to NBC News.

'Even if they wanted his money and he didn't want to give it to them, they didn't need to do that.

'They did a horrendous thing and they need to pay the consequences.'

And speaking one day after the dawn arrest on Monday of 16-year-old Kenan Adams-Kinard following a four-day manhunt for the killing of 88-tear-old, Delbert Belton, his uncle said that living in a small town narrowed his ability to make friends.

'He hung around with the wrong people and made the wrong choices,' Odell Kinard said of his nephew, Kenan Adams-Kinard. 'It's the summer and ain't nothing to do here.'

Charged with first-degree murder for the killing of Delbert 'Shorty' Belton, Adams-Kinard is due to appear in a Spokane court today, one day after another 16-year-old, Demetrius Glenn was charged as an adult and held on $2 million bail.

Glenn's lawyer says he plans to plead not guilty for the murder of Delbert - who took a bullet in the Battle of Okinawa - who was clubbed to death with flashlights as he tried to stop an apparent robbery in a crime which has captured the attention of the nation.

Police in Spokane said that Belton, was in his car in the parking lot outside his Eagles Lodge when the attack occurred on Wednesday night.

'The motive for this attack was robbery,' said Spokane Police Chief Frank Straub to NBC News.

'Race was not a factor. Additionally, there was no gang activity that was associated with his incident,' he added, noting that many commentators had pointed to the fact that the teens were black and the victim was white.

'These are two young men who just spun out of control.'

Glenn made an initial court appearance Monday afternoon. He is charged in Spokane County District Court with first-degree murder and first-degree robbery. The charges carry a potential life sentence.

District Judge Richard Leland, presiding over a packed courtroom, said the brutality of the attack and vulnerability of the victim make the high bail proper.

Glenn had turned himself in Thursday 
night, the same day Delbert Belton died of his injuries. The slightly 
built youth gave yes and no answers to questions from the judge but 
otherwise said

nothing.

Defense
attorney Chris Phelps noted after the hearing that the case has gone 
viral on the Internet, with many people expressing strong opinions.

'The evidence doesn't indicate what happened,' Phelps said, adding that witnesses only reported 'two kids running away.'

Straub said it appeared that Belton fought back against his attackers, which may have increased the severity of his beating.

‘Our information is that the 
individual fought back and that may have made this, you know, a worse 
situation,’ said Spokane Police Chief Frank Straub in a Monday press 
conference.

Straub was quick to maintain Belton’s innocence in the matter.

‘I'm not being critical of Mr. Belton,’ he clarified. ‘We certainly encourage individuals to fight back, and he should have. But it shouldn't have happened to begin with.’

While Glenn turned himself almost immediately, Adams-Kinard remained in hiding for four days as police worked with churches and the teens family to get him to surrender.

'The family was helpful. The family encouraged him to surrender. The family got the gravity of this,' said Straub to NBC News.

However, Odell Kinard expressed his shock at learning his nephew has been accused of killing a man.

'It really hurt to hear that,' he said to NBC News.

'He has to take responsibility,' he added. 'But the family is praying he gets 10 years or less.'

Unusually, Straub spoke of the lives of the suspects in this brutal case and the impact this crime could have on them.

'It bothers me that a distinguished World War II veteran lost his life,' Straub said. 'But the lives of the young suspects are also likely ruined,' he said.

'He came close to losing his life in service to this country in Okinawa and then he gets killed needlessly in the parking lot while he’s waiting for a friend. That’s the tragedy of this thing,' Straub said of the victim.

'The second piece is two young men whose lives and the lives of their families are ruined by criminal activity.'

Belton was born and raised in Spokane. He survived being shot in the leg in 1945 at Okinawa, one of the fiercest battles of the war, and went on to spend 33 years working for Kaiser Aluminum before retiring in 1982.

Belton was called Shorty by his friends because he was little more than 5 feet tall, his niece Pam Hansen said.
