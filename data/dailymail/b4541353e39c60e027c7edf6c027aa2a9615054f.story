Frustrated: President Barack Obama pauses while speaking about the budget and the partial government shutdown

Taliban has mocked the US shutdown, telling politicians that they are ‘sucking the blood of their own people’.

The comment was made by the Islamist militants, who are embroiled in a conflict with troops from the US and its allies in Afghanistan, in a statement issued on Wednesday.

It described American leaders as ‘selfish and empty-headed for taking money from their people and ‘lavishly spending the same money in shedding the blood of the innocent and oppressed people’.

The statement, according to AFP, said: ‘The American people should realise that their politicians play with their destinies as well as the destinies of other oppressed nations for the sake of their personal vested interests.’

It added: ‘Instead of sucking the blood of their own people, this money should be utilised for the sake of peace.’

The conflict in Afghanistan has claimed the lives of 444 UK servicemen and women and 2,270 US troops.

There was anger on Tuesday over remarks made by Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who said that Britain and the US had done little more than cause ‘suffering, loss of life and no gains’.

In an interview to mark six months before he leaves office, he said: ‘The entire Nato exercise was one that caused Afghanistan a lot of suffering, a lot of loss of life and no gains because the country is not secure.’

Losses: The war in Afghanistan has resulted in thousands of deaths for Nato forces

He accused Nato of focusing on Afghan villages rather than Taliban and Al Qaeda ‘sanctuaries and training grounds’ in Pakistan and also attacked air strikes as a ‘violation’ of sovereignty.

Karzai was installed in 2001 after allies drove the Taliban from power and he agreed that they should continue fighting.

In the interview he also accused NATO on
 focusing their war against terrorism on Afghan villages instead of 
Taliban and al-Qaeda bases in neighbouring Pakistan.

Following his attack on the organisation, NATO’s former Secretary-General, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, hit back at Karzai's critique, calling it 'unfair' to the soldiers who have lost their lives to protect a country not their own.

The shutdown, meanwhile, has pushed 
hundreds of thousands of workers off the job, closed national parks and 
museums and stopped an array of government services.

President Barack Obama and John Boehner, the top Republican in Congress, are pressuring each other to open the way for votes to end the government shutdown and raise the federal debt limit.

The shutdown has been forced by Republicans who oppose the Affordable Care Act – or Obamacare – a healthcare reform plan that recently became law.

They want to see cuts made to it, so are refusing to vote on the federal debt limit being extended until they can negotiate changes.

The debit limit, currently at $16.94tn, is set every year by a normally routine temporary spending bill, but this year Republicans are using it as leverage.

Without having approval from both sides on what it can borrow, the Government has had to halt payments to various institutions and services it funds and, of course, lots of employees.

Barack Obama has warned that if the government's borrowing authority is not extended by October 17, the United States will not be able to pay its bills.
