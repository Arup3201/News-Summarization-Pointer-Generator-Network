A six-year-old boy fell to his death through a child-safe window thinking he was ‘invincible’ like his hero Spider-Man.

Kevin Morais was climbing along the window ledge in his bedroom on the third floor when he lost his grip and fell into the back garden.

His mother, nurse Maria Morais heard the fall and found her ‘naughty little boy’ lying in a pool of blood.

Breaking down in tears, she told West London Coroner’s Court: 'I went to
open the door to see what had fallen and it was my son.'

The mum-of-two, who is a trained nurse, said she called an ambulance, but Kevin was already unresponsive. 

'I said "I know my son is dead". 'He is dead",' she sobbed.

She told the inquest her son had just finished tidying his bedroom, and doing his homework, when he went upstairs to play.

She added: ‘Kevin was that sort of child, he used to feel bored very quickly, so he disappeared upstairs and I thought, that’s OK, his Dad’s upstairs in the living room and his sister is also upstairs.

‘After a few minutes, ten to 15 minutes after he disappeared from me, I just heard a bump in the garden and then what straight away came to my head, what has my husband left untied to fall.

Tragic: This is the home in Southall, London, were Spider-Man fan Kevin Morais fell to his death. His parents house has the cream door

‘I didn’t hear any screams or shout just a strong bump on the floor.

‘I went to open the door to see what is falling because I couldn’t hear and I saw my son there, and he was there on the floor with the blood around him.

‘Obviously I shout and scream, my husband came down and my daughter as well. They couldn’t believe what had happened.

‘They tell me keep talking to him, I was calling to him, there was no response, I said I know my son is dead. He is dead.’ 

Kevin had already fallen from the third floor of his family home in Southall, west London a year earlier. The inquest head he thought he was 'invincible' after 
surviving the fall.

He escaped uninjured, but Mrs Morais 
said she had called her landlord to check the windows because her 
‘naughty boy’ loved climbing on anything.

A statement from PC James Rose said: 
‘I spoke to the family friends and they explained how Kevin loved 
Spider-Man and had jumped from a window two years previously and had 
suffered only a scratch and this may have made him think he was 
invincible.’

Dad John Morais, who is a builder, 
told the inquest he felt the windows could open too easily when he 
examined them after Kevin’s death.

‘After all that tragedy when I came up to the window I found with a push it opened easily,’ he said.

Awful: This is the window from where the 6-year-old fell

‘I don’t want to create any 
speculation that is beyond my understanding, but one thing is for sure 
because of one window that was supposed to be locked I lost my son. I 
hope it doesn’t happen to any other family.’

When asked by the coroner if he had 
anything to add he said: ‘Just end everything, because whatever, nothing
is going to bring my son back.’

Mrs Morais had not touched the window
since saying: ‘Its too painful for me to go near the window, the only 
thing I do every day in that room is open the curtains and close the 
curtains.
‘I just want this to be over its too painful for me to go through this.’

But PC Katie Dunford, one of the first on the scene, told the inquest there was only a small gap.

‘I could see the left window was open
and the window had a safety feature which prevented them from opening 
fully, and I remember thinking at the time I didn’t know how a child 
could fit through that gap, because it was only a small gap,’ she said.

Detective Sergeant Fiona Hepworth confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances or neglect issues relating to the death.

Coroner Lorna Tagliavini ordered the housing association A B Dominion Homes to examined the safety catches on their windows to avoid another tragedy after the inquest was unable to establish exactly how Kevin had fallen.

She said: ‘It is quite clear that very tragically Kevin managed to get out but the circumstances are not clear.

‘We simply do not know whether there was a small gap, a large gap or whether there was a fault that needs to be addressed.

‘I am concerned that as these are standard windows in a large number of properties that there is potential for a repeat occurrence to happen.’

He was flown to hospital by air ambulance after the accident on March 6 2011, but died the following day.

Director of Property Services for the
company, who run 35,000 homes, David Lingeman said that incident 
occurred when the property was owned by a different company.

He said the window had not been examined since the death out of respect to the family.
He confirmed it was there responsibility to ensure they were safe.

The coroner added: ‘I have found on 
the balance of probabilities he was climbing on the windowsill and 
either fell against the window or opened it sufficiently for him to fall
through.

The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death.
