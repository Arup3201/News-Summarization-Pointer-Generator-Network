General Motors is sending Facebook messages to car owners who have still not fixed a potentially deadly ignition-switch defect.

The automaker has resorted to using social media and making phone calls eight months after it began recalling more than two million vehicles.  

There has been heavy publicity surrounding the recall, including thousands of news stories and five congressional hearings, but it seems that the message is still not getting through.

CEO of the automaker Mary Barra has even sent a personal letter urging people to get the switches replaced

Despite recall letters that bluntly warn that the defect can lead to injury and even death, only about 1.16 million of the 2.36 million affected vehicles still on the road have been brought in for repairs. 

As a result, GM has been forced to go beyond the usual ominous-sounding recall letters.

It has sent out Facebook messages and made phone calls to owners of the cars, mainly Chevrolet Cobalts and Saturn Ions. 

CEO Mary Barra has even sent a personal letter urging people to get the switches replaced.

'In some cases we've gone to the owners' home and gotten the vehicle, gave them a loaner, and are working to fix it,' Ms Barra said last week.

GM announced in February and March that it was recalling the cars after taking more than a decade to disclose the defect, now linked to at least two dozen deaths. 

It explained that the ignition switches can wear from heavy, dangling keys. If the key chains are bumped or people drive on rough surfaces, the switches can suddenly change from the 'run' position to 'accessory' or 'off'.

This cuts off power-assisted steering and brakes and can cause drivers to lose control. The air bags also may not inflate in a crash and protect the driver and passengers.

GM is urging people not to put anything on their key rings until the switches are replaced. 

One of the unrepaired cars belongs to Kim Atkins, a media relations specialist in Austin, Texas, who received recall notices in April and June for her 2007 Cobalt. 

Busy with moving back to her hometown from college and starting a new job, she ignored them both.

'I didn't think it was very serious just from the wording on the recall notice,' said Ms Atkins, 24. 'I'm sure that it was important. I didn't get a sense of what the actual issue was, just neglected to do it.'

Ms Atkins said her fiance is mad at her for dallying. Now, she has made an appointment to bring her car into the shop this week. She has also removed everything from her keychain as instructed by GM.

Seven-year-old Trenton Buzard received an undisclosed compensation payout after he was paralysed when his great grand mother's Chevrolet Cobalt careered out of control when the ignition switch failed

Because the recalled cars are no longer produced, parts supplier Delphi Automotive had to bring machinery out of mothballs to start cranking out replacement switches.

Repairs finally began in April when the replacement switches started to arrive at dealers. Last Wednesday, GM announced that Delphi had made enough to fix all the cars.

Barra said the challenge now is to find those people who 'have still not called the dealership and said, "Hey, let's get my car scheduled."'

GM's extraordinary efforts to reach people were part of an agreement that ended a federal investigation into why the automaker failed to promptly disclose the switch problem.

It is not unusual for some car owners to ignore recall notices. The average completion rate 1.5 years after a recall begins is 75 per cent, according to federal safety regulators. But few recalls are as serious as this one.

 Kenneth Feinberg, the lawyer handling compensation claims for GM, on Monday raised the number of deaths attributed to the defect to 24. That toll is likely to rise as he handles more cases.

Among the 24 is Virginia law student Lara Gass, 27, who died in March when her 2006 Saturn Ion rear-ended a tractor-trailer and caught fire on Interstate 81 while she was on her way to work as a law clerk for a federal judge.

Witnesses told her family's lawyer, Bob Hilliard, that the air bags did not inflate, an indication of a defective switch.

At the time of the crash, GM had announced the recall and was sending warning letters. But the parts were not yet available. Her family recently accepted a settlement from Feinberg for an undisclosed amount.

Among the most recent cases settled is that of seven year old Trenton Buzard, from New Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

He was paralyzed when the car being driven by his great grandmother Esther Matthews lost control due to the faulty switch and ploughed into another vehicle on April 2, 2009. 

Two families from Wisconsin have accepted a settlement offer from General Motors after two teenagers were killed in their cars in a crash caused by a faulty ignition switch.

Amy Rademaker, 15, and Natasha Weigel, 17, were killed with the Chevy Cobalt they were passengers in crashed. A fault with the car's ignition switch turned off vital systems such as the power steering and airbags moments before the crash. 

About one-third of those who have not had the repairs done are people with children, while one-fifth are young people without children, GM spokesman Terry Rhadigan said.

Usually those people who do not get their cars repaired are the ones who have not seen any symptoms, said John O'Dell, senior editor for the Edmunds.com automotive website.

'People just don't want to be bothered,' O'Dell said. 'They don't see this as a problem. 'It's not happening to me. 'Then they just forget about it.'
