One of the most notorious sex scandals in British history has taken a mysterious new turn after a chance discovery.

A portrait of a young woman involved in the Profumo affair has been found on the back of a drawing of Christine Keeler, whose affair with a married Cabinet minister shook the Establishment in the 1960s.

The woman apparently witnessed the moment the model first met John Profumo at a debauched party - but her identity is completely unknown and curators are now appealing for help in discovering who she was.

Some have pointed out that the picture is almost identical to another key player in the scandal - but unfortunately, no one knows her name.

The discovery of the pastel sketch was made by a curator at the National Portrait Gallery, where an exhibition marking the 50th anniversary of the scandal has just gone on display.

Clare Freestone noticed that a drawing of Ms Keeler by scandal-ridden doctor Stephen Ward had a note attached to it by its subject.

The note, from March 1975, read: 'This is me, but I don't know who the girl on the back is - she is somebody we just picked up at a bus-stop.'

When they turned over the paper, they saw a beguiling portrait of a young woman with a fashionable haircut looking off to her right.

Scandal: John Profumo was forced to resign from the Cabinet after it emerged he was sleeping with Ms Keeler

In Ms Keeler's autobiography, Scandal!, she says that Ward had asked her to find girls to attend a party in 1961 at his house on the Cliveden estate, owned by the aristocratic Astor family.

'Driving past London airport we offered a lift to a girl waiting at the bus stop,' she wrote. 'She seemed nice, so we invited her to the party at Stephen's cottage.'

That party turned out to be the start of the affair between Profumo, then the Secretary of State for War, and Ms Keeler, a showgirl 27 years his junior.

The Tory MP walked in on Ward, Ms Keeler and their unknown new friend in the swimming pool, and chased the model around when she was wearing nothing but a towel.

All this must have been witnessed by the woman, who could also have met distinguished guests at the estate such as Ayub Khan, then the president of Pakistan.

Ms Keeler's memoir records that the mystery guest was driven back to London after the party.

The Profumo affair was considered 
emblematic of the early 1960s, a time when the traditional British way 
of life was rapidly being replaced by modern customs.

John
Profumo was forced to resign as Secretary of State for War in 1963 
after it emerged that he had lied to Parliament about his relationship 
with model and showgirl Christine Keeler.

The Conservative minister was 27 years older than his lover, and was married to actress Valerie Hobson.

The
scandal was even believed to endanger national security when it was 
revealed that Ms Keeler was also having an affair with Soviet spy 
Yevgeny Ivanov, as well as notorious drug dealer Johnny Edgecombe.

When
Harold Macmillan resigned as Prime Minister later that year, his 
decision was widely thought to be linked to the fall-out from the 
affair.

Profumo, who died in 2006, devoted the rest of his life to rehabilitating his reputation through charity work.

The National Portrait Gallery is keen to discover the woman's identity to fit another piece into the puzzle of the Profumo affair.

'We would love to know who she is,' curator Terence Pepper told the Guardian. 'Or if one of her friends knows who she is, or her grandchildren. It is a real mystery and that's why we need some help.'

Ms Keeler, 71, one of the few actors in the scandal who is still alive, has not commented on the mystery.

Her friend Leon Norell, who was at the Cliveden party, told The Times: 'I vaguely remember giving a lift to somebody. She must be about 70 now.' He added that he thought her name might be Ursula.

One intriguing possibility is that she could be a woman known as 'Miss X' who testified against Ward at his trial for living off the proceeds of prostitution.

The witness, who bears a striking similarity to the portrait, told a court in 1963 that the osteopath had seduced him and added that he had a two-way mirror as his bedroom door.

Ward's trial came in the wake of Profumo's affair with Ms Keeler, which led to the minister's resignation and helped to bring down Harold Macmillan's government in 1963.

The relationship was considered particularly scandalous because the model was simultaneously sleeping with Yevgeny Ivanov, a Soviet spy attached to the Russian embassy.

Scandal '63: The Fiftieth Anniversary of the Profumo Affair opened at the National Portrait Gallery this week, and runs until September 15.
