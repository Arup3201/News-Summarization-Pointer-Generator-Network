QPR have been offered Corinthians striker Alexandre Pato.

The 25-year-old, who previously played for Italian giants AC Milan, could make the move to west London in this transfer window. 

Pato is on loan from Corinthians at Sao Paulo - where he has scored 12 goals in 30 appearances since joining earlier this year.

Adel Taarabt is keen on a move away from QPR and could make a move to wealthy Dubai club Al-Ahli

After a very much up-and-down few years since leaving Milan in 2012, a move to the Premier League strugglers could be the right tonic to reignite the Brazilian's career at the highest level. 

Redknapp could fund the deal by offloading £65,000-a-week Adel Taarabt to wealthy Dubai club Al-Ahli. 

The Moroccan has made it clear he wants a move away from Loftus Road, although his preferred destination is Italy.
