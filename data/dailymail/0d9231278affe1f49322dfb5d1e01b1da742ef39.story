Jamie Roberts could be granted an early return to Wales if Racing Metro go ahead with plans to terminate the centre’s contract before the World Cup.

Sportsmail understands that, although nothing has been finalised, the 28-year-old is considering his options and could leave France this summer if a severance deal is agreed with the Parisian club.

A dual contract with the Welsh Rugby Union is one possibility and, speaking to Sportsmail last month, the Lions star revealed that he would ‘love’ a return to the Cardiff Blues at some stage in his career. ‘I wouldn’t dream of playing for any other team in Wales apart from Cardiff,’ said Roberts.

A media report in Wales on Monday claimed that Racing are considering letting Roberts go 

‘In England, if you grow up playing for Bath I’m sure you would have no qualms about going to play for Leicester or a London club. Demographically in Wales it’s very different.

‘When I finish in France, there will be some big decisions to make. That’s a bridge I’ll have to cross pretty soon and I’m looking forward to doing it. I would love to go back to Cardiff one day.’

Cardiff Blues chief executive Richard Holland last night told Sportsmail he would be keen to open negotiations with Roberts, while a source close to the player said he is ‘looking at his options’.

Roberts is contracted to Racing until the end of next season but, despite a man-of-the match showing against Northampton recently, has made only 26 appearances in 18 months. 

Roberts will be entrusted with shutting down France centre Mathieu Bastareaud in Paris on Saturday 

‘If Jamie was to become available, we would of course be keen to have discussions,’ said Holland.

The centre was left out of Sunday’s squad for the top-of-the-table clash with Clermont Auvergne and, speaking yesterday, Wales assistant Shaun Edwards said he would be welcomed back across the Channel.

‘We want all of our players back in Wales, but I haven’t spoken to Jamie about it,’ said Edwards. ‘I just want Jamie to concentrate on one thing this week and that’s the match against France.

‘It’s a big help having the players in Wales. I remember when Mike Phillips was with Bayonne. In those down weeks where they normally have a rest and get their body back together, they have to go back and play again. In the end, it is very taxing. There is also the travelling.’

If that scenario unfolds, it would potentially create a dual-contract opportunity for Roberts with the Welsh Rugby Union and a Welsh region
