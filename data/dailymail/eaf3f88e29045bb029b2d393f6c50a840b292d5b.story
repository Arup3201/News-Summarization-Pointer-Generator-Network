A key report on the impact of fracking was censored 63 times in just 13 pages.

Even the author's name was among the redactions by Whitehall officials, which have been described as 'comical' by campaigners.

The internal report, written in March by Defra's Rural Community Policy Unit, has now brought fresh accusations that the Government has something to hide over the effects of shale gas exploration.

Deleted sections included eight from the executive summary, four from the chapter on economic impacts, four from the section on social impacts, and 17 from the analysis of the impact on local services.

The chapter examining the effect of drilling on house prices had three sections cut. Only three paragraphs survive in the conclusion.

Even a summary of previous research is heavily censored – despite the original studies being freely available to the public.

Defra – the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs – claimed yesterday that there was a 'strong public interest' in withholding all the information so officials could consider the issue without 'closing down discussion'. It gave copies of the report to the Environment Agency.

But Green Party MP Caroline Lucas accused the Government of wilfully withholding negative data about fracking – the process by which shale gas is extracted from rock.

'This report would be comical if it was not so serious,' she told Radio 4's Today show. 'The only conclusion you can draw from looking at this report is that the Government has something to hide and we need to know what that is.'

The document, entitled Shale Gas: Rural Economy Impacts, was released after an environmental information request – similar to a Freedom of Information request.

One section that remains intact refers to a 2010 study which found the value of properties near a well in Texas fell by up to 14 per cent.

A Government spokesman last night said there is no evidence that house prices would be affected by fracking, adding that it will provide energy security, growth and jobs. Defra said the decision to redact was made by civil servants alone.

Information Commissioner Christopher Graham has already said he will not tolerate the censorship of embarrassing reports and is seeking a review of a study into the HS2 high speed rail project.
