Brentford are in talks to sign Lewis MacLeod from Rangers.

The 20-year-old has been tipped to become one of the best midfield talents to emerge from Scotland and has been watched by Aston Villa, Burnley, Blackburn and Everton in recent months.

However, Championship promotion hopefuls Brentford have made a move to sign him in January.

It is understood Brentford were alerted by coach David Weir, the former Rangers captain, who still keeps a close eye on Scottish football and has good contacts with his former club.

Brentford hope to convince MacLeod that he has a better chance of regular football at Griffin Park and will join a team on the up rather than one struggling in the Premier League.
