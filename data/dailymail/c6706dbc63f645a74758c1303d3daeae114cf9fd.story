Tragic: Cain MacDonald, of Inverness, was described by his parents as 'a loving, happy and active child'

A six-year-old boy has died after hitting his head on a metal pole while playing on a trampoline in a garden with his friends.

Cain MacDonald, of Inverness, was described by his devastated parents Myrrh and George as ‘a loving, happy and active child’.

The Dalneigh Primary School pupil died at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness last Thursday.

Cain’s parents said: ‘He was a typical wee boy and loved playing outside with his brothers, cousins and friends. We are devastated by his loss and he will be sorely missed by us all.'

The couple have another son, Reagan, nine.

In a letter to Cain’s relatives, his headteacher Shona MacKinnon said: ‘Cain was a popular little boy who is greatly missed by us all.

'This is a shock to all the school community and we are all deeply saddened.’

Georgina Quin said in a Facebook tribute: ‘Just don't know what to say, doesn't seem real. Going to miss seeing your cheeky wee smile every day. A special little boy who will never be forgotten.’

Rachel Mackay added: ‘Absolutely heartbreaking. My thoughts are with the family. Cannot even begin to comprehend how they must all be feeling. Rest in peace little one.’

And Donna Hooper said: 'A beautiful boy - he looks just like his father. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Macca (George) and his family. No parent should have to bury their child.'

Education: Cain MacDonald, who died last Thursday, was a pupil at Dalneigh Primary School in Inverness

Northern Constabulary sent a report to 
the procurator fiscal but there were not thought to be any suspicious 
circumstances, reported the Scottish Sun.

Cain's father Mr MacDonald says on his Facebook profile page: 'Most importantly I'm a very proud father to two amazing sons... Reagan MacDonald and Cain MacDonald. They light my world up.'
