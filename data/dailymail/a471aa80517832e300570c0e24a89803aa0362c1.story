One week into the Barclays Premier League season and Louis van Gaal is already beginning to sound a little like his predecessor.

‘I’m not hired to be fired,’ said the Manchester United manager. ‘I’m hired to build up a team. It’s a process and that process needs time.

‘I think the fans of Manchester are intelligent. I’ve already said that the first three months will be difficult for the players, especially, and the fans. I’ve said it also to (executive vice-chairman) Ed Woodward and the Glazer family that it is always like that — this is not an overnight job.’

Four months after his sacking by Manchester United, David Moyes is still upset that his own attempt to play the long game at Old Trafford was cut short after less than a season. Van Gaal, then, should be careful about looking too far into the future.

Nevertheless, the Dutchman’s lament was easy to understand. These are extraordinary times at Old Trafford as the club’s first continental manager endeavours to impose a new playing style on a squad that looks short of quality and is already ravaged by injury.

United lost to Swansea at home on the opening day and on Sunday they travel to Sunderland at the end of a week that has told us a lot. Manchester City and Chelsea have won away and look primed and ready, with strength in depth waiting on the bench.

United, meanwhile, are trying to plug holes, with Woodward looking for salvation in the last week of the transfer window and Van Gaal seeking understanding from his new audience. This week former United midfielder Paul Scholes claimed he was ‘scared’ of the future he envisaged for the club.

‘Paul Scholes has to believe in the philosophy,’ said Van Gaal. ‘I can imagine that the fans are also scared because they have seen the last year and now they have seen the first home match. But they have to believe. Two weeks ago I was the king of Manchester and now I’m the devil of Manchester.

‘It’s the football world — especially the media. The club have hired me for my philosophy, not because I’m a nice person. I am a nice person but it is my philosophy they hired.

‘For example, I have to drive on the left over here and I have to pay a lot of attention to drive properly. It costs me a lot of energy. It’s the same for the players. I bring another philosophy into the club and that’s difficult for them because I have to give a lot of information. I’m only saying what is my experience. 

Heading for the exit: Danny Welbeck has been told he can leave Manchester United during the transfer window 

‘Clubs like Barcelona and Bayern Munich are a good reference point. That’s what I am saying, it will take three months. But it could be one month, or it could be four months. But it is not a question of being champion at the end of the season, because we have to build up a team, and that process takes maybe longer.

‘At my other clubs, we did it in the first year, so what can I say? We have to wait and see, and believe in it. But when I have to say it five times, it is not a good signal.’

United’s new signing Marcos Rojo sat alongside Van Gaal at his press conference on Friday. The fact the central defender does not yet have a work permit to enable him to play perhaps sums up the start United have made to the new season.

Rojo may have to wait until Tuesday in the Capital One Cup at MK Dons, a game where Danny Welbeck may also figure after apparently being told by the manager that he can leave the club.

Van Gaal wouldn’t confirm that he was looking to sell the England striker but nor did he deny it. It is, however, hard to imagine United selling a talented 23-year-old in whom they have invested so much without buying a replacement first.

‘I know what I have said to Danny and Danny knows exactly what I have said to him,’ said Van Gaal.

‘I don’t speak about it, it’s private. I assume Danny Welbeck is not talking about our conversation and that’s the way it should be.’
