Boston bomb suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev faces charges that could lead to the death penalty.

The Obama administration has a range of legal options and has indicated it intends to move quickly to build a criminal case against the 19-year-old.

Massachusetts doesn't have the death 
penalty, but he is expected to be charged early this week with using weapons of mass destruction to kill people, a federal crime that does carry that sentence.

Investigators plan to first question him
 without informing him of his legal rights to remain silent and have an 
attorney present.

The CIA officers waiting to interrogate 
him are part of a unit that questioned the most high-profile terror 
suspects at Guantanamo Bay, according to U.S. defence sources cited by 
The Times newspaper.

Looming decision: The Obama administration has indicated it intends to move quickly to build a criminal case against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev

Critical: Tsarnaev, who was arrested Friday night, remains in critical condition under heavy guard after he was apprehended in Watertown

The High-Value Detainee Interrogation
 Team was set up in 2009 to extract information from suspects as quickly
 as possible after their capture when they are at their most vulnerable.

Several Republican lawmakers on Saturday criticised the administration's approach because they said it would afford Tsarnaev more rights than he deserves.

The federal public defender for Massachusetts called for the quick appointment of a lawyer to represent Tsarnaev because of serious issues involving his interrogation in the absence of a lawyer.

Prosecution of Tsarnaev in federal court would seem a natural course for an administration that previously won a life sentence against Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab of Nigeria for trying to blow up a packed jetliner using a bomb sewn into his underwear on Christmas Day 2009.

Death penalty? The Obama administration has a range of legal options in the Boston Marathon bombings, and they could include seeking the death penalty against the 19-year-old suspect in the case

Instead of reading Tsarnaev his Miranda rights, prosecutors planned to invoke a public safety exception created by the need to protect police and the public from immediate danger

The administration also will put 
Osama bin Laden's son-in-law on trial in January on charges that he 
conspired to kill Americans in his role as al-Qaida's chief spokesman.

As
 a U.S. citizen, Tsarnaev could not be tried by a military commission 
under current law; the only option for prosecuting an American is in 
civilian courts.

A federal official with knowledge of the case said Tsarnaev was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in September 2012.

The official was not authorized to speak publicly about details of the case and requested anonymity.

Tsarnaev
 was under armed guard at a Boston hospital and was reported in serious 
condition and unable to be interrogated Saturday.

He has yet to be charged but prosecutors appear to have no shortage of federal laws at their disposal.

The
 most serious charge would be the use of a weapon of mass destruction to
 kill people, which carries a possible death sentence.

Three people died in the twin explosions in Boston and more than 180 were injured.

Massachusetts does not have the death penalty, and it remains to be seen whether the administration would try to persuade a jury to sentence Tsarnaev to death.

Outspoken: Sens. John McCain, R-Arizona, and 
Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, are part of a group of four lawmakers 
demanding not to read the teenager his Miranda rights

The state could try to bring charges 
against him, including for the death of Sean Collier, the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology police officer who authorities say was killed by
 Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan.

An early question that arose after Tsarnaev's capture on Friday was how to conduct his initial interrogation.

The administration said it would not immediately inform him of legal protections known as the Miranda rights.

Instead,
 prosecutors planned to invoke a public safety exception created by the 
need to protect police and the public from immediate danger.

The
 American Civil Liberties Union's executive director, Anthony Romero, 
said the exception applies only when there's a continued threat to 
public safety, like whether there is imminent danger from other bombs, 
and is ‘not an open-ended exception’ to the Miranda rule.

The
 federal public defender for Massachusetts, Miriam Conrad, said her 
office expects to represent Tsarnaev after he is charged and that he 
needs a lawyer appointed as soon as possible because there are ‘serious 
issues regarding possible interrogation.’

But several congressional Republicans said Tsarnaev's rights should be even more restricted than the administration intends.

‘I
 am disappointed that it appears this administration is once again 
relying on Miranda's public safety exception to gather intelligence 
which only allows at best a 48-hour waiting period that may expire since
 the suspect has been critically wounded,’ Senator Saxby Chambliss of 
Georgia, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said 
in a statement hours after Tsarnaev was captured.

Joint statement: Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New 
Hampshire, left, as well as Rep. Peter King, New York, right, both 
signed the statement saying there were valuable things that the suspect 
could reveal

Chambliss' concerns were echoed by Senators John McCain, R-Ariz., Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., as well as Representative Peter King, R-N.Y.

‘A decision to not read Miranda rights to the suspect was sound and in our national security interests,’ the four said in a statement. 

‘However, we have concerns that limiting this investigation to 48 hours and exclusively relying on the public safety exception to Miranda, could very well be a national security mistake. It could severely limit our ability to gather critical information about future attacks from this suspect.’

But Representative Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a former federal prosecutor and member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the administration should ignore ‘hasty calls to treat the suspect as an enemy combatant.’

‘This is not a foreign national caught on an enemy battlefield, but an American citizen arrested on American soil,’ Schiff said.

‘The Justice Department has demonstrated a far greater ability to successfully prosecute suspected terrorists in federal courts than the military commissions have thus far been able to show. Nothing must be done to compromise the public safety, the ability of prosecutors to seek justice for the victims or our constitutional principles.’

While the Republicans asserted that Tsarnaev can be held as an enemy combatant, the Supreme Court has never resolved whether citizens or foreign nationals arrested on U.S. soil can be held by the military, as opposed to civilian authorities.

The court twice was prepared to take up that question in recent years, once while George W. Bush was president and once since Barack Obama became took office.

Both times, the administration moved the suspected terrorists, U.S. citizen Jose Padilla and graduate student Ali al-Marri, from a military brig to civilian confinement to head off the high court case.
