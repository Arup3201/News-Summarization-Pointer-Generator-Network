Four suspected illegal immigrants have been detained after reportedly hanging on to the top of a lorry as it drove along a motorway.

Kent Police were called to the London-bound carriageway of the M20 at 12.15pm today following reports of suspected migrants on the vehicle.

It is understood the driver pulled over after seeing an arm hanging down from the roof of his lorry as he drove along the motorway.

Police were notified and the lorry parked up on the hard shoulder to await their arrival.

Police were called to the M20 in Kent after four men suspected of being illegal immigrants were seen sitting on top of a lorry 

The men have been detained and Kent Police say they will now be handed over to immigration authorities

The motorway - the main route between the Channel Tunnel and London - was closed near Ashford while police removed the men, said to be of 'Middle Eastern appearance'.

The lorry stopped 12 miles from the exit of the Channel Tunnel and around 15 miles from the Port of Dover, where ferries arrive from France. 

A Kent Police spokesman said: 'Kent Police was called at 12.15pm today to a report of some suspected illegal immigrants on the M20.

'Officers attended the London-bound carriageway at junction 9 and four people have been detained. The immigration authorities will duly be informed.'

Last month, 13 suspected illegal immigrants, believed to be from Ethiopia, were detained after being spotted running from the back of a lorry on a busy motorway.

Rush-hour traffic had to be slowed between junctions 12 and 13 of the M25 as Surrey Police dealt with the incident on September 22.

Just four days earlier, a man was arrested for alleged 'facilitation offences' after 24 Eritrean nationals were discovered in the rear of an HGV in Whitfield, near Dover, Kent.

Police arrived at the scene and closed the motorway but had to wait for firemen to arrive to remove the men

The incident caused huge tailbacks on the motorway, which runs from the Channel Tunnel to London

The latest discovery comes a day after riot police were called to the French port of Calais as more than 400 immigrants tried to storm lorries bound for the UK.

French police used tear gas and batons to disperse the crowd but chiefs admitted some illegal immigrants may have got onto lorries during the disturbance.

A Home Office spokesman said: 'We work closely with the police to tackle illegal immigration and continue to strengthen the security of our border to stop those who have no right to enter the UK.

'If people have a genuine need of protection they should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach.

'If they are just seeking to evade immigration control they need to know that they are risking their lives and that they will get caught.

'The new Immigration Act makes it harder for people to live in the UK illegally.

'It makes it harder for illegal immigrants to abuse our benefits and public services, and makes it easier for us to remove them by reducing the number of appeals.'
