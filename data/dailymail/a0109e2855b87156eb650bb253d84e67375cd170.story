After being selected by the St. Louis Rams in the 2014 NFL Draft, then waived from their practice squad, Michael Sam's professional football future seemed somewhat bleak.

That all changed in September however when the Dallas Cowboys added him to their practice squad, though they too waived him in late October making him a free agent.

Now, Sam is wondering why he keeps getting cut because he says he has the talent to play professional football.

Cut: Michael Sam (above) the first openly gay NFL player, was recently asked about being cut from the St. Louis Rams and Dallas Cowboys and why he was not on any NFL team's roster

So in love: Sam has been very public about his relationship with boyfriend Vito Cammisano

When asked by TMZ why he thought he was not on the roster of an NFL team, Sam said; 'I think I was the SEC Defensive Player of the Year last year ... so I don't think it had to do with talent.'

And while they took that to mean Sam was saying he was cut because he was gay, he quickly clarified his statement on Twitter.

'Despite what headlines you may read, I’ve never said and have never believed that I am being kept out of the league,' wrote Sam.

'I know I have talent to play in the NFL and I look forward to getting an opportunity once again to prove that I can help a team win.' 

Clearing the air: Sam later clarified his statement to TMZ on Twitter

Reaffirming: He repeated that he knew he had the talent, but has never believed his sexuality is why he was cut or not playing

Superstar: Sam was named one of GQ's Men of the Year

Football or not, Sam's career has been taking off since he graduated from University of Missouri, with the  24-year-old becoming perhaps the most famous openly gay professional athlete, becoming so big he even graced the cover of GQ as they named him one of their Men of the Year. 

And if the NFL doesn't work out he does have a big fan in Mötley Crüe front man Vince Neil, who has been very vocal about wanting him for he new Las Vegas Arena Football League team.
