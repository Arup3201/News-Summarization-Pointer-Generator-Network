Whitney Thompson is used to breaking boundaries. She was the first ever 
plus-size winner in the history of America’s Next Top Model and has 
since launched a plus-size dating site, worked with pop royalty Rihanna and fronted 
hundreds of campaigns.

Her latest? Flying the flag for plus-size women in a fun and flirty new lingerie campaign.

The 26-year-old,
 who won the modelling show back in 2008, stars in a tropical photoshoot for Panache's Sculptresse range.

New gig: Plus-size model Whitney Thompson is the new face and body of Panache's lingerie range

Posing in an American style diner, Whitney models the vibrant and playful lingerie, which is available from a 36-46in back and from a D-J cup, to perfection.

American-born Whitney is extremely vocal with her views on the plus-size industry and has become a poster girl for fuller-figured women.

‘If men were only attracted to women 
who looked like Victoria Beckham, then we would all look like her. But 
they’re not and that’s why we are all different shapes and sizes,' she told MailOnline last year.

Whitney
 has taken it upon herself to spread her message to the masses in her 
role as an ambassador for the National Eating Disorder Association.

She travels to Universities all over the States and attends global charity events to support the cause.

Speaking
 about her work, she said: ‘After winning the show I knew I wanted to be
 involved in philanthropy and as the only plus-size model in the history
 of the show I knew I needed to do something in touch with that; it felt
 like a good fit for me.

‘University
 age is when you’re deciding who you’re going to be for the rest of your
 life so I love that I’m impacting on people.’

And
 it seems like her hard work is paying off. She was recently named one 
of the most influential women in the world, beating off stiff 
competition from the likes of Hilary Clinton and Michelle Obama.

One thing Whitney refuses to do is bow to pressure to eat less or exercise more in the name of her figure.

‘I travel all the time, I haven’t 
been home in over a year because I am literally on a plane every other 
day’ (she was recently photographed in 200 outfits in one day during a shoot in 
Istanbul.)

‘When I can and I have the energy, I run because it’s the easiest thing to do but I don’t ever do anything I don’t want to do.

‘I’ll
eat what I want to and I think that’s the problem – people stop 
listening to their bodies and start listening to the media.

‘We
have a multi-million pound diet industry that wants us to think we are 
fat so they succeed, they get our favourite celebrities on board and the
problem is that no one is listening to themselves.

Mouthpiece: Whitney has long championed a fuller figure and refuses to bow to pressure to diet or lose weight

‘If I want a steak and chips, I am going to eat it and when I feel like going on a run, I will.

‘But I’m never going to force myself 
to do that. Life is too short; I could walk outside and get hit by a bus
 so I may as well eat what I want to eat,’ she said.

‘At the end of the day, you have to look in the mirror and say: “This is it, this is the only body I’ve got.”

‘I’ve definitely been criticised for marching to the beat of my own drum but I take pride in that. You can’t listen to anyone.

‘It
 hurts. I’ll get called a fat cow or that I am huge. People are harsh. 
The show is in over one hundred countries so I get hate mail from lots 
of people but the fan mail is worth so much more than that.

‘The reason I went on top model was 
because I wanted to live out my motto: “You must be the change you wish 
to see in the world”.

‘There
 was no other plus-size model that was really outspoken about the 
industry and I feel like I have accomplished everything that was on my 
check-list.

‘If I did stop modelling tomorrow, I would be satisfied with the work I have done.’
