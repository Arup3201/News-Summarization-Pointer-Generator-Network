An insecure boy has transformed his figure, his confidence and his love life after taking up weightlifting as a young teenager.

After a tough breakup Lou Brierley, 21, from North Wales, put all his focus into training  and before he knew it he was competing at a national level - and turning heads.

'I started working out when I was 16 due to a recent end in a relationship; I needed something to keep me busy and occupied... the gym seemed like a good idea,' he says.

After a tough break up in 2010 a 16-yr-old Lou Brierley, 21, from North Wales put his focus into training and before he knew it was competing at a national level - and turning heads. Pictured here aged 16 in 2010 before training started (l) and recently, four stone heavier, aged 21 (r)

'Before I started training I thought I was skinny and didn't really like the appearance that looked back at me in the mirror. 

'I was a typical gaming geek. I used to eat microwave meals and drink tonnes of Irn Bru with no real feeding pattern - more than likely between a game on the Xbox. 

'I was tall, thin and that was about it. I only weighed about 10 stone, so it was time things changed.  

'I quickly got the bug and enjoyed working out more than I thought. I saw progress in my body and this spurred me on even more, wanting to be bigger, leaner and stronger.  

'My first bodybuilding competition was 2011, when I had just turned 18. I then competed at a higher level in 2012 and qualified for the British Natural Bodybuilding Federation finals.

'After bodybuilding my focus changed from wanting to be the most aesthetically pleasing to being the strongest I could possibly be. 

'I hung up my trunks and pursued powerlifting, in which I again qualified to a national level achieving a 210kg squat and a 240kg deadlift. 

Lou says being in 'competition condition' became good for catching people's attention

'My biggest focus at the moment is developing my career and my personal training business, however I hope to make a return to both bodybuilding and powerlifting in the next few years.'

And it seems his path to fitness has helped his love life, as he's since bagged a girlfriend. 

'Dating wise, being in competition condition was always good for attraction and catching peoples attention - but nothing more. My girlfriend of 16 months, Beth Jones, was actually first attracted to me because I was "ripped", so I guess you could say it helped!

'Beth is actually training to be a fitness instructor. She is in college and currently trains with me during the week. We met through friends, then we started training together and then our relationship developed further.'

Beth says: 'I remember seeing Lou and I was instantly attracted to him. He was tall, dark, handsome and I loved his six pack! 

'There are quite a few positives about working out together. We motivate and support each other to reach our goals. Lou is honest with me about what areas I need to work on. I love training with Lou as each session is enjoyable and he fully supports me in everything I want to achieve. 

'I am extremely proud of what Lou has achieved, the biggest thing for me is seeing how much he has grown as a person. His maturity and attitude has changed so much and seeing his transformation is amazing for such a young man too. I know there is a lot more to come out of him and I am with him every step of the way.'

But Lou says his biggest support when it comes to competitions is his mother.

'Throughout competition prep she was amazing, she helped prep meals, helped me pull through tough times and even tanned/shaved me the night before the competition. I couldn't have done it without her.

'My health has improved massively and so has my quality of life. 

'My outlook on nutrition is completely different - I eat to feel and look good so I don't mind taking longer to plan and prepare meals. 

'I truly believe the struggles and dark times I faced during competition prep has shaped who I am today. My mentality and my focus have improved dramatically and I am now a very driven goal-orientated person, before which I was lacking focus, clarity and self-belief.'

'In regards to image I have gone from a small 10 stone, up to 15 stone at my biggest but I tend to carry a weight of around 14 stone year round.

'My whole shape has dramatically changed, as well as the way I view myself. I never believed image was important, but in the job I now lead I feel it is a massive part of building the respect of clients.

'I became a brand ambassador for BodyBuilding Warehouse after entering a social media competition and I'm so grateful to my sponsors for their support, encouragement and inspiration.

'With my shift in mind set and focus I am now set on helping other people transform their lifestyles like I did mine. I would like to compete again as both a powerlifter and a bodybuilder, but for now I am primarily focused on growing my business, The Fitness Academy, and helping others.

'My advice for youngsters wanting to follow in my footsteps would be to learn the basics. 

'Get good at the basic movements and ensure you are doing them correctly. Research and ask people who have been there and done what you're trying to achieve and then make your own judgement on what you believe. Nutrition wise, keep things simple, don't over complicate things. For training, exactly the same, don't get caught up in these advanced routines for advanced trainees, just keep it simple, and stick to the basics. They will work.'

Jack Lovett a personal trainer and expert in teen fitness from Spartan Performance says starting a structured resistance training programme at 16 is perfectly safe 'provided it is done so under qualified guidance'.

The fitness expert, who has trained UFC star Davey Grant, fighter Curt Warburton and Newcastle United's Alex Gilliead since he was 14 years old, says: 'I certainly concur that the confidence-boosting qualities experienced by Lou's are not exclusive to him,'

'Every single youth we have trained at Spartan has benefited both in the gym and out of it. I find training to be incredibly empowering. It does not discriminate. Hard work and dedication is rewarded accordingly.' 

When prepping for a competition Lou trains four times a week split across the muscle groups

The heaviest I've been is 96kg and my last stage weight was 75kg with a body fat of around 7 or 8 per cent. 

Competition mode

When I'm in prep I train four times a week split across the muscle groups.

It would be chest and shoulders, back and traps, arms, and legs, across a four day time period.

A typical training split I use when training for competitions include weight and cardio sessions, training two on, one off and cardio every other day for 20 minutes each session. 

Off season 

Now when in 'off season' mode I train three times a week on a push-pull, legs basis with more of an emphasis on recovery between workouts. 

It is very much based around compound exercises trying to add as much stress to the body as possible. 

Rep ranges are often kept between five and eight but sometimes I go as high as 12, depending on exercise and body part.

Stretching and foam rollering is very important for me as my hips have taken a beating through powerlifting, so I follow an 11 set routine before I train to make sure my hips are fully ready for training. 

Supplements 

My supplement regime is very consistent, on waking I have a multi vitamin, vitamin D3, omega 3 fish oils, 1 scoop of Warrior Greens superfood blend and one scoop of Warrior Reds superfood blend, this covers all health bases and gives my body a prime platform for growing.

During training I used PeptoPro which is a fast digesting protein, alongside cyclic dextrin which is a fast digesting carbohydrate and kick starts my recovery before I've even finished my workout. 

Diet       

I eat plenty of chicken cooked in extra virgin olive oil, steak, spinach, kale, sweet potato, peanut butter, porridge, whey and some white rice. I snack on protein bars and popcorn and drink plenty of coffee (perhaps too much).

Those are most of my food choices, and I just vary the quantities. My competition diet consists of higher protein, moderate carbs and low fats. Nutrition is key.
