Authorities have revealed details surrounding the arrest of Sydney man Peter Gardner who is being held in a Chinese jail for alleged drug-smuggling.

Gardner will find out his fate on Sunday - his 37th day in custody - whether or not he will be charged or released as this is the longest Chinese police can hold someone without an outcome.

The 25-year-old was taken into custody along with Kalynda Davies, also from Sydney, who has since returned to Australia. 

 Chinese authorities alleged they found 30kg of ice inside the luggage of Sydney man Peter Gardner 

Gardner could face the death penalty by firing squad for allegedly attempting to traffic 30 kilograms of methamphetamine, also known as the drug ice.

Guangzhou Customs claim they found the drugs in 60 vacuum-sealed bags inside Gardner's luggage while he was on his way to Sydney on Flight CZ325, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

His two pieces of hand luggage had to be forced open by authorities in an interrogation room in Baiyun Airport as the zippers were super glued.

It is believed to be the most ice local customs have ever found leaving the country. 

The pair had only travelled to Guangzhou - in China's southern region - for three days and were on their way home November 8. 

They were stopped at security screening after checks revealed something unusual inside Gardner's bags. 

A month later, his companion - Ms Davis - was released without warning, with authorities later explaining there was no evidence that tied her to the alleged drug trafficking in a statement to Fairfax Media.

'There was no evidence that shows [Davis] had any subjective intention to take part in this drug trafficking crime,' Guangzhou Customs said.

These details emerge as the father of Gardner said he did not know if his son was innocent.

Russell Gardner told The Daily Telegraph his son was 'doing okay' while in prison.

The woman who was with Gardner at the time of his arrest was Kalynda Davis.

She was also taken into custody but was released and returned to her relieved family in Sydney last Tuesday after spending a month in a cramped Chinese prison cell. 

But Peter Gardner, who she met on Tinder just weeks before travelling to China, remains locked-up in Guangzhou.

'I don’t know if he's innocent. She obviously was innocent because the police wouldn't have let her go if they couldn't pin it on her,' Gardner's father told the Telegraph. 

'There’s probably more to the story but the embassy know and the lawyers know.' 

Mr Gardner said his son, who had never been in serious trouble  before, had not been allowed to make any contact with  his anxious family, except for sending a couple of letters.

Despite this, and the threat of the death penalty, he said Chinese police were treating his son 'okay'.

'I’ve got over that initial shock you get at first, but you’ve got to take it as it comes. We’re managing, we’re pulling together. We’re still a close family, the Chinese are treating him okay,' he said. 

Peter Gardner, a New Zealand national, had been living in Richmond in Sydney's north-western suburbs after completing his apprenticeship at a western Sydney construction firm. 

Russell said the accusation his son had been carrying methamphetamine did not make any sense. 

He said he had hired a Chinese lawyer and the family were nervously waiting on the findings of  the Chinese investigators. 

A former friend told Fairfax Media Gardner was a 'great guy' who was 'very caring, nice and softly spoken'.

'I guess he just got tangled up in a bad way of life. Every time I talked to him he was always genuine and never seemed like he would get involved in that,' the Richmond High School alumni said.

While Gardner remained in jail, his travel companion, Kalynda Davis, touched down in Sydney last Tuesday.

Family and friends of the 22-year-old were seen coming in and out of her home in the days following her homecoming.

Friends of Kalynda Davis in Sydney have told media 'she's doing fine.'

'She's great, she's innocent, she's fine,' a friend said outside the family home. 

Daily Mail Australia understands Ms Davis will catch up with some of her friends in private over the weekend. 

Kalynda Davis's (pictured) friends say they have constantly believed that her truth was always going to come out

Ms Davis met Gardner just weeks before they took a spontaneous trip to China together 

Kalynda Davis’ anguished father said he ‘just collapsed’ as soon as his little girl returned home after an ordeal he described as 'a parent's worst nightmare and multiply it by ten'.

‘I knew she was so innocent. I prayed every night that the truth would come out… We found out that she was being released on Friday [December 5] night,' former policeman Larry Davies told The Western Weekender.

‘We cried and cried and cried and cried and I don’t think I had more than four hours sleep after that until last night, when she was home safely.'

Ms Davis quickly found herself in a living hell after starting out on what was meant to be a fun spontaneous trip with Gardner who she met on Tinder two weeks before.

Ms Davis later told her father: 'I'm sorry dad, I didn't do it, I didn't do it, I didn't do it'.  

The Glenmore Park resident's long blonde hair was cut into a short bob while she was locked up in the detention centre. 

She was kept in a small holding area, ‘with a small area to sleep and that’s it’, but her family last week praised the Chinese authorities for being very respectful in their treatment of Kalynda. 

Kalynda Davis was driven away from the family home by her father to escape the hype and attention just a day after she arrived home last week

When friends of Ms Davis heard of her return, all they could express was relief.

'SHES HOME!! BIGGEST SMILE EVER!,' close friend Dan Stella wrote on his Facebook page.

'The last month has been a daily struggle but today I sit here with tears of happiness.

'I can't even concentrate, drivin' off the road and s**t haha. "So happy!" Every day we have something to be thankful for!  

'Today is kal is home safe and well with love ones. See you soon, always had ya back, always will... so glad your ok "best day of my f**king life...... love ya kal".'

A school friend told Daily Mail Australia the Davis family would be delighted to have Kalynda home for Christmas.

'This is amazing news. Especially for her family, they must be so happy to have her home for Christmas and I'm so happy for them all and ecstatic to hear she's home,' they said.

Kalynda's friend of more than a decade, Blake Tatafu, 22, told Daily Mail Australia he was overjoyed at his good mate's release.

'I don't think there's actually words to describe [how I'm feeling]', Mr Tatafu said.

'It just proves that the truth will set you free.' 

A family liaison officer- DFAT's Claire Went - was sent from Canberra to China to support the Davis family, who said in a statement they would not have made it through without her.

'Without the support of Ms Went we would not have been able to get through this difficult time', they said. 

Asked if he was delighted Kalynda was home safe, John, a visiting elderly relative told Daily Mail Australia: ‘Of course we are.'

Her family have always said she was innocent in the entire incident, which saw her facing a possible death penalty 

Following their daughter's return, Kaylnda's parents - father Larry and mother Jennifer - told reporters they were pleased and relieved Kalynda was free and safe following her month-long ordeal in Guangzhou.

In a statement, they said: 'We are happy to have Kalynda back home. We have always known Kalynda to be innocent of these allegations.'

'Her return home today is a clear statement of her innocence.

'We have received so much support from family and friends. We thank everyone for the support we have received during the last month.'
