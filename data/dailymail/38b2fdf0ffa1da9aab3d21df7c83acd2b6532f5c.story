David Cameron is to warn there is 'no going back' if Scotland votes for independence in his last public appeal to keep the United Kingdom together.

The Prime Minister will use a speech in Aberdeen tomorrow to warn a Yes vote will the Scotland and the rest of the UK 'go our separate ways forever'.

His campaigning visit – his tenth to Scotland this year – comes after he spent yesterday considering a union of a different kind by attending a society wedding in Hampshire.

With four days to go until the historic referendum on Thursday, polls suggest the race is neck-and-neck.

Mr Cameron has been mocked by Yes campaigners for not making more trips to Scotland, claiming the appearance of senior Tories north of the border bolster support for independence.

But the Prime Minister will use his speech to Conservative activists in Aberdeen to set out a positive case for preserving the Union, and argue against using the referendum as a chance to punish Westminster parties.

He is expected to say: 'This is a decision that could break up our family of nations and rip Scotland from the rest of the UK.

'And we must be very clear. There's no going back from this. No re-run. This is a once-and-for-all decision.

'If Scotland votes yes, the UK will split, and we will go our separate ways forever.'

The latest Poll of Polls, compiled by political expert Professor John Curtice at WhatScotlandThinks.Com, puts the No campaign narrowly ahead on 51 per cent. It follows four new polls overnight, with only an ICM survey for the Sunday Telegraph giving the Yes campaign a lead, which based based on a smaller-than-normal sample of only 700 people

He will reject attempts by First Minister Alex Salmond to portray the choice as being one of 'whether Scotland is a nation'.

Mr Cameron will say: 'Scotland is a proud, strong, successful nation. The vote on Thursday is about two competing visions for Scotland's future.

'The Nationalists' vision of narrowing down, going it alone, breaking all ties with the UK.

'Or the patriotic vision of a strong Scottish nation allied to the rest of the United Kingdom with its own stronger Scottish Parliament at its heart and with the benefits of UK co-operation on jobs, pensions, healthcare funding, the currency, interest rates.'

Downing Street insiders said Mr Cameron had spent the weekend working on his speech.

But he also found time to mingle with well-heeled guests in the Hampshire village of Northington, where Samantha's half-brother Jake Astor married Victoria Hargreaves.

The younger son of Viscount Astor and his wife Annabel, 33-year-old Jake is an Old Etonian who studied at Oxford University and works as a Mandarin-speaking investment analyst, while his wife is a consultant for a luxury brand.

The couple were thrown a pre-wedding reception in Downing Street two days ago, laid on by the Prime Minister's wife.

They are part of the aristocratic Astor family, descended from the 19th Century fur trader and America's first multi-millionaire John Jacob Astor.

Mr Cameron may have had the marriage in mind as he prepares to warn against the break-up of the 'family of nations'.

First Minister Alex Salmond claimed that people saying they would vote against his dream of independence were 'only deferred ‘Yes’-es', as Better Together leader Alistair Darling insisted the No campaign was on course for victory. The two men appeared on the Andrew Marr Show, where Mr Salmond posed with a violin

The latest raft of opinion polls all point to differing results, but suggest the result is too close to call.

A Panelbase survey for The Sunday Times put No on 50.6 per cent and Yes 49.4 per cent.

A poll by Survation gave the No campaign an eight-point lead on 54 per cent to 46 per cent while an Opinium survey in The Observer put No on 53 per cent and Yes 47 per cent.

However, a surprise ICM poll for the Sunday Telegraph put the Yes campaign eight points ahead, on 54 per cent, although it was based on a survey size of only 700 people.

More than 4.2million people have registered to vote in the historic referendum which will decide the fate of the 307-year-old Union. Experts predict the turnout could be as high as 85 per cent. 

Better Together leader Alistair Darling insisted internal campaign research put them comfortably ahead, but he suggested half a million people in Scotland have not decided how to vote with opinion polls suggesting the race is neck and neck.

First Minister Alex Salmond claimed that people saying they would vote against his dream of independence were 'only deferred ‘Yes’-es', as he faced claims he was embarking on a 'premature victory lap' with four days until the historic referendum.
