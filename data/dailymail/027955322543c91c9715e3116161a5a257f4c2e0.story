Whether spiralling up statues, connecting narrow passages, or scaling the side of a mountain, the world's most treacherous staircases all have one thing in common: they require nerves of steel.

From the 70 per cent incline on the stairs of the Cambodia's Angkor Wat temple to the slippery rock path cascading down the side of Ecuador's Pailon de Diablo Waterfall, the scariest steps are often as stunning as they are terrifying.

Even the world's most adventurous traveller will be challenged by the Half Dome in Yosemite National Park, in California, where a cable ladder is required to ascend the 400m incline. 

To worship at Machu Picchu's Moon Temple, intrepid hikers must scale another 600 feet of granite rocks, whereas 4, 444 steps are required to reach the top of the Florli Stairs in Lysefjord, Norway.  

At the Mount Huashan Heavenly Stairs in China, the steps are carved into a sacred Taoist mountain.

There's no official count on how many there are, so take heed when embarking upon this initial ascent, which also includes a three-plank-wide horizontal walk and then second flight of mountainside stairs to reach the top.

Still, if you're eager for some serious bragging rights amongst your friends, try these impressive ascents on for size.
