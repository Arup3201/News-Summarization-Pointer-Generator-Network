Con Edison found a 'hazardous situation' in August in one of the three buildings that was destroyed in an explosion and fire in Manhattan's East Village last week.

Utility workers dispatched in August found 'dangerous gas line connections' after a Con Edison worker reading gas meters smelled gas, according to a Con Edison spokesman.

The worker smelled gas on August 6 in the basement of the building that exploded at 121 Second Avenue on Thursday.

Firefighters kept blasting water at pockets of flames among the rubble on Friday as it continued to smoulder

Cars were flattened by the debris as the three buildings collapsed overnight following the explosion 

When they were at the building in August, the utility workers found 'multiple leaks' in hoses that were connected to the gas line, the New York Times reported. 

The company spokesman said Con Edison shut off the building's gas for about ten days, until it was determined to be safe. 

The owner of Sushi Park, the restaurant where the explosion occurred, told the  Times that utility workers determined that gas intended for his restaurant was being siphoned off illegally for use in newly-renovated apartments upstairs. 

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Friday that the blast was possibly tied to someone 'inappropriately' tapping into a gas line. 

An hour before the blast, Con Edison utility inspectors had been at the scene and determined that pre-existing work was not satisfactory, but the problems were not safety related, the mayor said. 

A general contractor who went to check out the gas leak report as Sushi Park was one of 50 people arrested in February in a sweep of the city by building and housing inspectors.

Dilber Kukic was accused of bribing an undercover investigator to dismiss violations at two properties, the Manhattan District Attorney's office said. 

He is hospitalized and could not be reached for comment. 

In all 11 buildings were evacuated after the blast, leaving residents of 144 apartments needing places to stay

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said it could take up to a week for rubble to be cleared from the explosion site 

Firefighters have gone through the rubble but Nicholas Figueroa, 23, and Moises Luconare, 26, are stil missing

Twenty-two people were injured - four critically - and Nicholas Figueroa, 23, and Moises Lucon, 26, remain unaccounted for after the explosion.  

On Saturday, rescue crews with cadaver dogs clawed through smoldering rubble in the search for Figueroa and Lucon.

Authorities said it could take a week of careful digging through twisted debris, bricks and splintered wood before the basement is reached.

In all 11 buildings were evacuated, leaving residents of 144 apartments needing places to stay. 

Con-Ed said they may return to their homes as soon as Sunday.

The Manhattan district attorney's office and the NYC Department of Investigation are looking into whether gas and plumbing work being done privately in one building led to the explosion.
