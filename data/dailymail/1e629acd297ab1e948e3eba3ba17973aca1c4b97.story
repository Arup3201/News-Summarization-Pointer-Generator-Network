Police raided the dressing rooms at the Stadium of Light and Sunderland's training ground as part of their probe into Adam Johnson.

The 27-year-old England international was arrested on March 2 at his £1.85million mansion on suspicion of having sex with a 15-year-old girl and was bailed until Wednesday.

And Sportsmail can reveal that as part of the probe, officers also turned up at the 49,000-capacity Stadium of Light and the 60-acre Academy of Light and scoured both dressing rooms as part of their hunt for evidence.

It is also understood that all Sunderland staff were called into meetings following Johnson's arrest and warned away from posting anything about it on social media and from speaking to the press.

Johnson, who earns £50,000 a week, has been suspended by the struggling Premier League club.

The Black Cats, who are currently facing a battle against relegation, are now without a manager after Gus Poyet was sacked on Monday.

A source said: 'You don't expect to see police officers in a dressing room and quite a few people at the club were shocked by it. They were looking for things such as second mobile phones and notes, anything that would help them, really.'

Changing rooms at the club's Academy of Light training ground were also scoured by local police

Johnson was released on bail until March 18 and will continue to help police with their inquiries

They added: 'All staff were called into meetings and told in no uncertain terms that they were not to put anything on things like Twitter and Facebook and not to talk to the press about it under any circumstances.'

Johnson, a winger, has been in a relationship with girlfriend Stacey Flounders for three years.

Miss Flounders recently posted photographs of the couple’s first child, Ayla Sofia, who was born on January 8. It was unclear if she and her daughter were at home at the time of the player’s arrest.

He has scored 20 times in 105 games for the club, including the winner at Newcastle in this season’s Tyne-Wear derby.

Born in Sunderland, Johnson signed for the club for £10m from Manchester City in 2012.

Three unmarked police cars, a police van, several plain-clothed officers and a forensics team were seen at Johnson's house, close to the quiet hamlet of Castle Eden, as he was questioned at Peterlee police station.

Ex-Middlesbrough man Johnson has been bailed until March 18.

Sunderland were thumped 4-0 at home by fellow strugglers Aston Villa on Saturday with thousands of angry supporters leaving the match before half-time with their team already four goals down.
