Tottenham's topsy-turvy start to the Premier League campaign continued as the north London outfit suffered a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Alan Pardew's Newcastle. 

Mauricio Pochettino's side have now won just three of their opening nine Premier League games after suffering their fourth loss of the season. 

Here, Sportsmail's Craig Hope gives his verdict on how the players performed at White Hart Lane.

Tottenham (4-1-4-1)

Hugo Lloris 5.5

Barely had a save to make but picked the ball out of his net twice and that made the difference.

Hugo Lloris was unable to stop his side from conceding two goals against Alan Pardew's Newcastle

Eric Dier 5.5

Strong and willing to get forward but both United goals came from his flank.

Jan Vertonghen 6

Cruised through the afternoon but still ended up on the losing side.

Younes Kaboul 6

Like Vertonghen had little to do but they failed to prevent either concession and for that they must be culpable.

Danny Rose 5.5

A frustrating 90 minutes for the full-back and very little came off for him on an attacking front.

Etienne Capoue (off 67) 5

Strolled through the game without making any impact.

Erik Lamela (off 78) 6

Showed flashes but never once threatened Krul and was thwarted at every avenue.

Ryan Mason 6.5

Laid on the cross for opening goal and was bright throughout, linking play and making himself available.

Tottenham's Ryan Mason claimed the assist for Emmanuel Adebayor's opener

Christian Eriksen 6

Never hid but did little with the ball either. A disappointing afternoon on the whole.

Nacer Chadli 5

A real surprise to see him last the full game. Did very little.

Emmanuel Adebayor (off 83) 6

Took his goal well and there were signs of improvement, but he faded after the break.

Adebayor scored Tottenham's only goal of the match in the 18th minute

Harry Kane (on 67) 6

Looked the best bet for an equaliser late on and one cross-cum-shot flashed across goal.

Aaron Lennon (on 78)

Roberto Soldado (on 83)

Newcastle (4-2-3-1)

Tim Krul 6.5

Could do little about Spurs goal and undertook rest of his duties with minimum fuss.

Daryl Janmaat 6.5

Lamela had a couple of periods where he switched flanks and tried to get the better of Janmaat, but on both occasions he was given short shrift and sent back to the right.

Steven Taylor 7

One under-cooked back-pass caused a first-half scare but he was solid apart.

Fabricio Coloccini 6.5

Recovered from a shaky start and marshalled his backline well.

Paul Dummett 6

Up against the in-form Lamela he must be applauded for affording the Argentine little chance to shine.

Jack Colback 6.5

Neat and tidy as ever, without being spectacular, but provided the throughball for Ameobi’s equaliser.

Vurnon Anita (off 46) 5

Struggled to get to grips with Spurs’ midfield and was no surprise to see him sacrificed at the break.

Gabriel Obertan (off 46) 5.5

Little chance to replicate recent form given high, hopeful balls forward and made way at half-time.

Gabriel Obertan was handed the chance to impress but failed to make an impact 

Moussa Sissoko 7.5

This was the perfect platform for Sissoko to shine, for it was all about his power and pace rather than lack of panache.

Yoan Gouffran 6.5

Put a shift in and repeatedly cleared corners at the near post.

Ayoze Perez (off 79) 7

It looked a thankless task early on but the full debutant kept going and got a deserved winner with his first since joining the club.

Newcastle striker Ayoze Perez scored what turned to be the winning goal against Tottenham

Subs

Sammy Ameobi (on 46) 7

What an impact! Within eight seconds of the restart he had scored with a super finish and he continued to cause problems.

Remy Cabella (on 46) 6.5

Provided the cross for Perez’s winner and looked far brighter than of late.
