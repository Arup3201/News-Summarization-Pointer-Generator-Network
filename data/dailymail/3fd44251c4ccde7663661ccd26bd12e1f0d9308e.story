A police officer and former U.S. Marine who survived two tours of duty in Iraq was gunned down on Thursday while pursuing a hit-and-run driver in Plymouth Township, Pennsylvania, a day before his 35th birthday.

According to officials, Brad Fox was running down a suspect, identified as 44-year-old Andrew Charles Thomas, following a car accident when he was shot in the head - becoming the first officer from his department to be killed in the line of duty.

Thomas was later found dead after apparently turning the gun on himself, according to police. 

Partners: Officer Brad Fox was killed in the line of duty while pursuing a suspect in a hit-and-run crash, while his K-9 dog, Nick, was injured

Hero: Fox, a former combat Marine, served two tours of duty in Iraq before attending a Philadelphia K-9 school and joining the Plymouth Township police force

Fox, a seven-year veteran on the force who had just graduated from a Philadelphia K-9 school, leaves behind a wife pregnant with their second child, and a five-month-old daughter.

'There are just no words that can begin to express the magnitude of this tragedy,' said Montgomery County District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman during a Thursday night press conference.

'Officer Fox served two tours of duty in Iraq. He put his life on the line day in and day out. Men around him lost their lives.

'He was able to come back from that service, come back to the comfort of his country and to lose his life so senselessly today. There are just no words to explain how horrific it is, how senseless it is,' Ferman said.

Hectic scene: Fox and other officers responded to the scene of an accident involving an SUV that drove off after smashing into another car

Hot pursuit: Fox spotted the SUV abandoned and chased the driver on foot into an industrial area

Ambush: Police say the suspect fired at least four rounds at Fox from a hiding place on a hill, striking him in the head at this spot now marked by flags

The tragedy began unfolding at around 5:16pm Thursday when officers responded to a three-car accident on East Ridge Pike in the Conshohocken section of the suburb, according to WFMZ.

About half-an-hour later, officers on the scene spotted a 2006 Infiniti SUV speeding past other cars in the opposing lane of traffic.

Fox and his fellow officers followed the SUV as it slammed into another vehicle and drove off, according to investigators.

Fox, accompanied by his K-9 dog, Nick, found the SUV abandoned on Ernest Station Road and went in pursuit of the driver on foot into an industrial area along the Schuylkill River Trail.

Shortly after, responding officers came across Fox lying in the grass with a gunshot wound to the head, His dog was also grazed by a bullet, but survived. 

The 34-year-old was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he died soon after.

Suicide: Police found the killer in the grass next to train tracks with two self-inflicted gunshot wounds to the chest

No. 1 suspect: Fox's suspected killer, Andrew Charles Thomas, left, was questioned in the 1999 disappearance of his fiance, Maria Procopio, right, but was never chagred in that case 

Officers scoured the area and found the suspected killer on the other side of the train tracks with two fatal gunshot wounds to the chest, according to police. A .9mm Beretta gun was discovered next to his body. 

‘This was a senseless, senseless act for a car accident,’ Plymouth Township Police Chief Joseph Lawrence said.

A preliminary investigation has revealed that Thomas ambushed Fox from his hiding place on the hill above the train tracks and fired at least four shots at the officer and his dog.

Thomas has been a fugitive on a forgery charge for seven years before he was captured this May. He pleaded guilty to the count which stemmed from him using $140 worth of counterfeit Acme gift certificates in 2005, according to police.

Family tragedy: Fox leaves behind a wife, who is pregnant with their second child

Thomas was on probation for theft and had assaulted a police officer in the past during an arrest. 

However, beside the small-time crimes, the 44-year-old had been the prime suspect in the 1999 high-profile disappearance of his fiance, 34-year-old Maria Procopio, according to NBC10.

Loyal friend: Nick, Fox's K-9 partner, was grazed by a bullet, but is expected to recover

Procopio went missing in September of 1999 after leaving her shift at QVC in West Chester, Pennsylvania. Her body was never found, and Thomas was never charged in the case.

Officials say that while serving time for the assault, Thomas told officers to dig up a wooded area in Whitemarsh Township, where a cache of weapons was unearthed.

Thomas used up to 40 different aliases and social security numbers during his life, police said.

On Thursday evening, Fox's fellow officers rode in a motorcade to escort his body from the Medical Examiner's Office to the funeral home.

Fox, who was described by Police Chief  Lawrence as a hero, was an organ donor, so even in his death he will help save lives.

The officer's killing sent shock waves 
through the suburban community, with many local residents flying 
American flags at half-staff in honor of the fallen hero.

Many grieving friends and even strangers also took to 
the Internet, launching a Facebook page called RIP Officer Brad Officer, 
which has attracted nearly 23,000 followers by Friday night.

Plymouth Township police will be off duty through at least September 19, according to Patch.com. Volunteers to cover their shifts were being solicited from other police forces around the region on Thursday night.
