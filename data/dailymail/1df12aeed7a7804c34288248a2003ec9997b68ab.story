Any mother would despair at seeing their child covered in mud.

And this flamingo was no different.

She gave her chick a stern look when he came back to the nest with dirt all over his white feathers.

Who's a naughty boy? This mucky flamingo chick, pictured with his mother, was covered in mud after taking its first steps out of the nest

But her anger didn't last as, before long, the chick snuggled up in his mother's feathers and enjoyed a bite to eat.

At just two weeks old, the flamingo 
chick had been taking his first steps out of the nest among the 80,000 
strong colony of birds in Rio Maximo national reserve in Cuba.

It spent half an hour slipping and 
sliding around in mud as he tried to scramble back to the nest before 
its mother noticed he was gone.

Photographer Andrey Gudkov spent a day watching the pair bond.

The mother flamingo would collect food in her beak from a nearby brook before returning to feed her son.

Feeding time! The chick ate a pureed dinner of plankton, shrimp and tiny fish from his mother's bill

Mr Gudkov, 40, said: ‘This mum and baby caught my eye because they were a bit separated from the other flamingos.

‘We were able to sit right inside the colony as flamingos aren't afraid of people.

‘But we still had to arrive before sunrise and leave after sunset, sitting motionless in the mud so we didn't disturb them.

‘The mother left the nest to feed and refresh herself, before coming back to feed the youngster.

‘I could hear them chattering away the whole time they were together.

‘When the mother returned, the chick would stand up, open his beak and ask for food.’

Each feeding session lasted a few seconds as the chick enjoyed a pureed dinner of plankton, shrimp and tiny fish from his mother's bill.

In time, this diet will bring out the flamingo's pink colour.

Mr Gudkov, a marine biology graduate, added: ‘After the chick is fed, it normally sleeps and the mother covered her baby with her wings to protect him from the heat.

‘I was interested in the one-to one feeding process and seeing how the flamingos interacted.

‘I loved the geometry of their long legs and necks, compared with the petite chick.

‘Their relationship made for a very tender picture showing how the big bird communicates with the small, weak chick.’

Mr Gudkov, a professional wildlife photographer from Moscow, Russia, was joined by a group of scientists in Rio Maximo national reserve, Cuba.

Each Spring, up to 100,000 flamingos fly in from the Caribbean to nest here.
