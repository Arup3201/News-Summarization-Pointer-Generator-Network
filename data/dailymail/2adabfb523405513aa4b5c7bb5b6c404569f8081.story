A vigilante cyclist dubbed 'the most hated man on two wheels' after using cameras to convict 70 motorists has even got a fellow bus driver sacked, it has emerged.

Dave Sherry, 37, has become notorious for filming drivers breaking road laws on his way to work with three cameras on his helmet and bike and then handing footage over to police.

But he has also turned in four clips of bus drivers using handheld devices behind the wheel during his two-and-a-half year crusade for road safety and said he would happily do it again.

The father-of-five from Harlow, Essex, saw one driver with his eyes off the road and as he passed his cabin, he darted his head to the right to capture the incriminating footage.

'The only people who are unhappy with me are the ones that drive like complete idiots. If you do no wrong then you have nothing to fear,' he said.

'If you are a good driver then you are not going to be on the YouTube for driving like a professional.

'Some aren't going to be happy with what I do but I don't care - life goes on. It's all in the name of safety. At the end of the day we are called professional drivers for a reason.

'If you want to do something wrong then you have got to face the consequences.

'If that means the job centre and a P45 then fine. If you break the rules then I will make sure you will be sorry - I will gladly do it again.'

Bus operators Roadrunner Coaches claimed that the driver had been viewing a handheld ticket machine - but sacked him anyway.

A spokesman said: 'The driver has since been dismissed because he shouldn't have been looking at something when he was driving.'

Essex Police investigated the incident in September 2013 but are yet to confirm the outcome.

The vigilante cyclist has handed three other clips of bus drivers on phones to the police in the hope they are prosecuted and fired.

He has also shamed dodgy cyclists by posting videos of them running red lights to his YouTube account.

During his 40-mile round-trip  from his home in Harlow, Essex, to a depot in east London, Mr Sherry lets motorists know his views on their driving and has even given a police officer a ticking off.

He takes his evidence to police and councils and says the footage has been used to secure 70 convictions for driving offences including speeding, overtaking too close and running red lights.

The father-of-five says he has secured two convictions for assault on him by angry drivers and is having a taxi driver investigated over claims he went the wrong way round a roundabout.

As well as helping police investigate driving offences - he says two drivers have been prosecuted for assault

Mr Sherry says he is now so notorious that he often has to fend off attacks from irate drivers, including several who have thrown punches.

He even goes equipped with a horn as loud as a jet plane to alert dangerous drivers of his presence. 

'I do what I do because I want to make our roads safer for everyone. If people follow the Highway Code there would be so many fewer accidents and casualties,' he said.

Mr Sherry started filming drivers cycling from Harlow to his east London bus depot two-and-a-half years ago after he was involved in an accident.

He said: 'Someone hit the back of my bike and the police said they couldn't do anything because it's my word against them.

'That spurred me on, so I went and got my cameras.'

The London bus driver said he is now 'Britain's most hated cyclist'.

The bus driver insists he posts the videos to highlight bad driving and to keep the roads safe for cyclists

Mr Sherry is unapologetic to those caught by his cameras and says: 'It's like a war zone out there'

'That spurred me on, so I went and got my cameras.'

Mr Sherry straps £1,000 worth of cameras to his bike for his daily rides and even resorted to wearing body armour for protection against motorists.

To stay safe he dresses head to toe in fluorescent clothing and took to wearing £80 body armour after he was assaulted in the line of his self-appointed duty.

He was punched in the stomach by a furious van driver, who police confirmed received a caution for ABH, in June 2013.

He said: 'He just saw red and went for the attack. He properly knocked me back with a punch and I smashed the back of my head on rocks behind me.

As well as a camera mounted on his helmet, he also had one of the front and one of the rear of his bike

Mr Sherry is not the only cyclist to attempt to shame drivers with videos shot from helmet and handlebar cams.

Lewis Dediare - also known as 'Traffic Droid' - has a camera mounted on a three-foot pole protruding from his modified bicycle.

The 39-year-old also carries a ruler to measure  his distance from cars and brandishes  a 'red card' at offending road users.

Like Mr Cherry, he also uploads his footage to YouTube and Twitter and will often hand it over to police so the drivers can be further punished.

Mr Dediare's antics were filmed for Channel 4 documentary The Complainers last year.

He says his naming and shaming video clips have resulted in around 200 police warnings every year, as well as several prosecutions.

The telecoms officer set out to take action against poor driving in 2009 when he was hit by a car which failed to indicate as drove into his lane while out cycling.

He broke two ribs and also injured his back and hip, but when he learned the driver had only been given a driving education course he felt more needed to be done to warn motorists of the dangers they pose to cyclists.
