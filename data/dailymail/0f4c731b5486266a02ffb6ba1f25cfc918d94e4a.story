Suspcious: During the clips, the sales assistance appears to be checking the shelf Rashid has just browsed, making sure everything is still there

But when he pans the camera and catches the employees, they quickly change their tact and act as if they are simply straightening Dorito bags, flipping hot dogs or rearranging displays.

Some of them are seen running off and hiding behind the shelves to avoid suspicion. 

Rashid decided to record the shopping experiences after employees repeatedly trailed him.  

With his second video, he posted a message saying: 'It happened again... this time I'm not even mad... I'm used to it now.'

In the video he is heard saying: '[The employee] been following me around the store the whole time. There she goes! She thinks I'm stealing.'

It has attracted 2,777 comments and been like by nearly 70,000 followers. 

After his videos became internet hits, he tweeted: 'Discrimination is never cool. I'm glad I could shed some light on such a sensitive topic in a positive way.'
