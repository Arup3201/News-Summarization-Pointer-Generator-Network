One Saturday evening a few years ago, a football manager confided his thoughts on Roy Keane to a small group of journalists. 

He deplored his behaviour, his disciplinary record and his general air of brooding malevolence. 

Somebody made the tentative suggestion that Keane might have one or two good points. The manager thought for a moment. ‘Maybe,’ he said. ‘But he keeps them bloody well hidden.’

At the time, it was an image which Keane did little to dispel. For him, it appeared, football was a violent game in a violent world. You played, you fought, you prevailed. And if you could inflict a little damage along the way, then so much the better.

Roy Keane does little to dispel his image as a malevolent hard man in the first half of his book The Second Half

In his playing days, it appeared, football was a violent game in a violent world - a game to be fought and won

It was a joyless philosophy, but Keane seemed a joyless individual; truculent, combative, a man who could pick a fight in an empty room.

The fact that he was a wonderful player, one of the finest of his generation, only enhanced his aura.

Some suspected the aggressive persona was something of an artifice; the cropped head, the jutting jaw, the intimidating stare.

There was more than a whiff of calculation about the way he carried himself, but so daunting was the effect that few were prepared to question his credentials. If it really was an act, then Roy Keane was a hell of an actor.

In truth, the question has not been settled by his latest autobiography, The Second Half.

Keane is at pains to reassure us that he really was the monster of myth and legend. His violent clashes are regurgitated in lingering detail.

The notorious assault on Alf-Inge Haaland is not only exhumed but opens the book: ‘I wanted to hurt him and stand over him and go, “Take that, you c***”. I don’t regret that.’

He describes a fight with Peter Schmeichel in a Hong Kong hotel: ‘Peter had grabbed me, I’d head-butted him.’

He relates in detail an altercation with Manchester United’s assistant manager Carlos Queiroz: ‘I’m surprised I didn’t knock him out.’

For those who subscribe to the popular perception of Roy Keane, the first half of this book will reinforce every prejudice. But then he becomes a manager. Everything changes, and his book captures those changes quite brilliantly.

We become aware that Keane possesses a rare capacity for self-analysis. On the face of it, he is the epitome of gruff indifference: ‘This is me. If you don’t like me, tough!’

In fact, he worries about his tendency to self-destruct, he articulates the difference between anger and rage, and he reveals an insecurity we scarcely expected in so assertive a character. And he gathers together all the strands of this infinitely complex personality, and goes off to manage Sunderland.

His confidences are occasionally beguiling: ‘I’d never had an office before. Now I had a secretary. I had a phone; a phone with buttons and different lines. I had a leather chair that swung around, a swivel chair. For the first few days I used to swing around on it. If any of the players or staff had peeped through the office window they would have seen me going, “Wheeeh!”’ He didn’t put up pictures of his family, since he didn’t want to make the place too comfortable: ‘I thought: “If things go badly, I want to be able to clear it out pretty quickly.” One box.’

In passing, he supplies a delightful deflation of the risible Robbie Savage. Keane has the vague thought that Savage might give Sunderland a lift. ‘So I got Robbie’s number and rang him up. It went to his voicemail: “Hi, it’s Robbie — whazzup!” — like the Budweiser ad. I never called him back. I thought: “I can’t be f****** signing that”.’

He picks up on the small things, like the pre-match choice of music.

‘The last song that was played before the players went out on to the pitch was Dancing Queen by Abba. What really worried me was that none of the players, nobody, said: “Get that s*** off”… We lost 3-1. I don’t think it was down to Dancing Queen, but after the match I criticised the players… They were going out to play a match, men versus men; testosterone levels were high. You’ve got to hit people at pace. F****** Dancing Queen. I wouldn’t have minded if it had been one of Abba’s faster ones.’

Slowly, certainly, he grows to love the club. He becomes utterly engaged in the complexities of the job; not merely the tactics and performances, but the human relationships, the anticipation of crises, the way the staff would come to him with marital difficulties or problems with their children.

‘I think that was one of my strengths,’ he says. ‘I think I had a kindness to me. But there was never a day when I’d go into work and come out in the same mood; there’d always be something going on.’

He starts to enjoy it, the setbacks and the successes.

He takes Sunderland from the foot of the Championship to the title in his first season. He preserves their Premier League place in his second.

He revels in the victories and tells a harrowing tale of his reaction to a 7-1 beating at Everton: ‘I hardly left the bed for 48 hours. I don’t think I even showered for two or three days. I was punishing myself.’ 

In the third year of a three-year contract, after some hard words with the new owner, he takes his leave. Just like that. Some six months later, he joined Ipswich. It was the wrong club at the wrong time. Again, he is fiercely honest: ‘I don’t think I’m a bad manager, but at Ipswich I managed badly.’

We sense that he almost welcomed the parting. But it was to Sunderland that he gave the best of himself, where he discovered what the job entails, and he tells his story with startling clarity and almost painful candour. It is light years beyond the usual pap of managerial memoirs: ‘Toe-to-toe with Jose… Wild nights with Fergie… My Dream Team to play Mars.’

Keane’s book, ghost-written by Roddy Doyle, is an endlessly absorbing piece of work. It may well be the finest, most incisive deconstruction of football management that the game has ever produced.

In short, it is something of a masterpiece. Roy Keane’s good points are hidden no longer.

PS

The people who conduct post-match interviews for Sky Sports are rarely mistaken for Jeremy Paxman. But last weekend’s cross-examination of Alex Song and Stewart Downing, following West Ham’s victory over QPR, touched brave new levels of obsequiousness. ‘Guys,’ began the interrogator, ‘after that brilliant win against Liverpool, was that a decent way to back it up?’ As the great Eric Morecambe used to say: ‘There’s no answer to that.’
