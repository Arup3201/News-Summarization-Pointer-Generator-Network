Expenses: Chancellor George Osborne among nine ministers claiming housing and travel expenses for their children

Scores of MPs including cabinet ministers are claiming housing and travel expenses for their children, it has been revealed.

The watchdog which monitors their expenses says 148 MPs made claims to rent larger properties for their young families, and claimed back money for their children’s train journeys.

These arrangements are within the rules, which were changed after the 2009 expenses scandal to allow MPs with children to claim thousands of pounds more than others.

However critics say such arrangements, revealed last night under freedom of information laws, would be unthinkable in the private sector, and are still too generous.

Such expenses revealed last night by the regulator involve nine minsters, including Chancellor George Osborne and culture secretary Maria Miller.

Labour leader Ed Miliband and shadow front bench couple Ed Balls and Yvette Cooper - who all have young children - have claimed allowances for them under the rules.

The latest claims in the Daily Telegraph come as MPs are poised to receive a £10,000 pay rise, recommended by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa).

Ipsa’s chairman Sir Ian Kennedy is expected to defend the move today, with a speech in which he will argue ‘you get what you pay for’

But Danny Alexander, the Treasury chief secretary told the Mail that voters would be ‘appalled’ if politicians accepted a huge rise while salaries in the rest of the public sector have been capped.

Mr Alexander said: ‘I think the British public would be appalled at the prospect, particularly given the state of the public finances. 

‘MPs have not seen the proposals as yet but I hope that when they come forward that they reflect the pay situation in the rest of the public sector and the very difficult economic circumstances we are in.’

Ipsa will not publish its long-awaited proposals for MPs’ pay and pensions until next week, and it is not expected it will come in until 2015.

But the body, which was set up in the wake of the expenses scandal, is widely expected to propose a pay rise of up to £10,000, coupled with cuts to MPs’ gold-plated pension.

The pay recommendation will also cast renewed scrutiny on the wider package of MP perks, including their expenses - claimed by 148 MPs for 300 children.

Claiming: Culture Secretary Maria Miller is also among the nine claiming. These arrangements are within the rules, which were changed after the 2009 expenses scandal

Many MPs insist that the necessity to have two bases means that they must be compensated for the costs associated with their children

Their basic wage is £66,000 and child benefit has now been axed for other working families earning more than £60,000.

Since 2010, MPs have claimed almost £140,000 for their children’s travel. They are allowed to claim £2,425 for each child who ‘routinely resides’ with them.

But more than 90 MPs have claimed above the accommodation cap of £20,000 a year - even for flats.

Divorced Greg Barker, the energy minister, claimed £23,904 between 2011 and 2012, for a two-bedroom flat in central London - £2,150 a month.

Meanwhile his ex-wife and children live in his constituency of Bexhill and Battle for £697 a month.Mr Barker said: ‘All of the claims were pre-approved by Ipsa and fully comply with the Ipsa rules.’

Chris Ruane, the Labour MP for the Vale of Clwyd, claims £1,906 a month for his London flat. He has two children and his eldest daughter turned 18 in November.

He also owns a flat about three minutes’ walk away. Mr Ruane said: ‘I have acted completely within the rules.’

The biggest travel claimant was Mary Creagh, the Labour MP for Wakefield, who has two children and claimed £4,061 in one year, mostly on rail tickets.

On the BBC’s Question Time last night Dr Sarah Wollaston, Tory MP and GP, said MPs should have a pay rise in return for giving up expenses and second jobs to make it a more ‘professional’ system.

But Labour’s Margaret Hodge said: ‘The timing is absolutely dire. Why should we be different from teachers and other public sector workers?’
