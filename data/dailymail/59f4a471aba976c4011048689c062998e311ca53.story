A coffin measuring almost 8ft long that has been specially made for Britain's former tallest man will be carried by ten pallbearers at his funeral.

Christopher Greener, of Bromley in south London, grew to 7ft 6ins tall before surgical intervention stopped him growing. He held the record as the UK's tallest man for four decades.

The 71-year-old, who weighed 30 stone, had to have a bespoke coffin made after he died last month and will be buried in a double plot of land near to his home. 

Christopher Greener, formerly Britain's tallest man, will be buried in a bespoke coffin measuring almost 8ft that will need to be carried by 10 pallbearers 

Funeral directors have calculated that Mr Greener's coffin will need at least 10 pallbearers to carry it because of the size and weight of the casket. Usually there are four pallbearers to carry a coffin.

They estimate the coffin will just about fit into the hearse, with less than two inches of space left.

Matthew Uden, funeral director at Hayes-based W. Uden & Sons, said: 'We've had to have the coffin specially made.

'They are normally about 6ft 2ins but this is just under 8ft - it's quite a difference.

'But the real struggle is making sure it's tough enough as he was quite a heavy chap too.

'We measured everything before we ordered the coffin and it just about fits into the hearse by about 2ins.'

Because of its size Mr Greener's coffin also has extra handles fitted so it can be carried by the extra pallbearers. 

Mr Greener was diagnosed at 27 with a condition known as pituitary gigantism where a tumour had grown on his pituitary gland, an organ that controls bodily functions including release of growth hormones.

Funeral directors said more pallbearers will be needed to carry the coffin because of its length and weight

Surgeons removed the tumour when he was already in the record books for being UK's tallest man and he would have continued to grow if they had not.

He played basketball internationally for Great Britain in the late 60s and early 70s and played the circus giant in David Lynch's film The Elephant Man.

Barry Tolson, who lives in Spain after emigrating from Croydon, south London, was Mr Greener's friend for more than 20 years and is helping to arrange the funeral.

He said: 'Chris, as my wife would say was a gentle giant. He was very funny, caring and kind and our whole family will miss him terribly.

'He struggled towards the end of his life with his health and found it increasingly difficult to get around.

'Mowing the lawn and day-to-day chores were extremely difficult for him being so extremely tall but he was always cheery and never stopped making us laugh.

Mr Greener lost his title as Britain's tallest man in 2007. The 71-year-old spent the majority of his life towering over friends and family. He is pictured above at a friend's wedding

'He even joked to Irene, my wife, that he expected getting a coffin to fit him could be difficult and that he wouldn't mind if we just got someone to "break his legs".' 

Christopher will be buried at St Mary's Cemetery in Hayes, Bromley, on March 9, after he died on February 11 at nearby Princess Royal University Hospital. 

Mr Greener lost his title of Britain's tallest man when he was replaced in 2007 by Neil Fingleton, who measures 7ft 7.56ins tall. 

Mr Fingleton, from Durham, also played basketball and is now an actor, having recently starred alongside Mila Kunis in Jupiter Ascending. 

Neither however beat the record of William Bradley, who at 7ft 9ins tall, was known as the Yorkshire Giant until his death in 1820. 

Last year Leonid Stadnyk, believed to be the world's tallest man at an estimated 8ft 5in tall, was carried to a graveyard on the back of an open truck because his remains were too large for a hearse. 

Throughout his life Mr Stadnyk, of Ukraine, had been refused to be measured to determine his height because he said it would be humiliating. 

Among the activities Mr Greener was able to take part in was basketball where he shone on the court
