Former Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel claims that nothing less than winning the Premier League will be good enough for incoming manager Louis van Gaal next season.

The Dutchman is expected to be confirmed as David Moyes' replacement next week and will be tasked with returning the club to former glories after a dismal season ended with a seventh place finish.

While returning to play Champions League football would be a step in the right direction for Van Gaal, Schmeichel insists the 62-year-old will set his targets higher.

'The club needs a strong man to steer us back up,' he said.

'We have finished seventh, so the top four is a good target to set yourself for next season. But Van Gaal will not want to accept the top four - he will try and win.

United are expected to dip heavily into the transfer market as the new manager attempts to rebuild a squad capable of challenging, with Schmeichel believing two players who have been linked to the club - Toni Kroos and Mats Hummels - would be excellent signings.

'United have got [Phil] Jones, [Chris] Smalling and [Jonny] Evans but going by what the media are saying, Hummels is a target,' he told the Daily Express.

'That's a good starting point to bring him in. He has good leadership skills and he is a fantastic defender. He's someone we've been looking at for a couple of years and he's been heavily connected with United.'

A central midfielder is also seen as a priority and Van Gaal is expected to follow up his predecessor's interest in Germany international Kroos.

'We need to bring in a midfielder -- players like Toni Kroos who has been mentioned for a long time and he would be a great addition.

'We need players that can install or restore the confidence in the club and squad as well.'
