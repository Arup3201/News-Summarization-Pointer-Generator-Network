On Sunday’s season premiere of Mad Men, Don Draper is told by wife Megan: ‘Don’t rip the ads out of my magazines.’

The show, which has become known for its strict historical accuracy, used a February 1969 issue of Playboy as a prop, and now the iconic title has released images of the actual ads Don might have wanted to keep.

The issue featured ads for Volkswagen cars, Schlitz beer and Rise shaving lotion, as well as placements for cigarette companies Marlboro, Pall Mall and Sail of Holland.

Playboy magazine experienced its heyday in the 1960s for its famous centerfolds and intellectual articles

Don and Megan have a discussion in their Los Angeles kitchen in the season seven premiere of Mad Men, just before Don was instructed not to rip ads from her magazines

Pall Mall's cigarette ad echoes a time when tobacco products were not heavily regulated by the government

Perhaps most pivotally, the ads 
express many of Don’s vices that have so vividly been played out by 
actor Jon Hamm over the show’s last seven seasons.

A
 heavy smoker, whose early run in the show was shaped by his copywriting
 work for Lucky Strike,  Don would have been both personally and 
professionally intrigued by the many cigarette ads that filled Playboy’s
 pages.

The tobacco ads’ lack of Surgeon General warnings and advisories may create a visual shock for the modern consumer. In fact cigarette companies at the time actually used medical findings to their advantage.

Pall Mall's ad, for example, claims that its cigarettes are ‘now lower in “tar” than the best-selling filter king! Who says so? The latest U.S. Government figures.’

Another one of Don’s favorite substances, alcohol, presents itself in full-force throughout Playboy’s advertising.

Schlitz beer, the preferred cheap beer of mid-century Ivy League-rs, uses a classic advertising approach in its 1969 campaign

Clubman's sports jackets advocate their innovations in synthetic materials (a growing sector at the time) and also promote their now laughably modest price of $65

Placements for Lejon vermouth and 
Antique bourbon position themselves as viable candidates for inclusion 
on Don’s consistently-stocked office bar cart.

While
 it appears that Don is currently taking a rest from drinking, as it was
 the primary reason for his suspension from work, previews for this 
week’s episode depict his reoccurring difficulty with managing his 
alcoholism.

Don also has a 
penchant for fast, sleek cars. The Ford Mach 1 Mustang ad depicting a 
Yuppie couple in matching WASP attire would have no doubt piqued his 
interest.

However, he may have personally disagreed with Ford’s tagline: ‘If you haven’t got a past yet … get a Mach 1. Now.’

Marlboro's Playboy spot is unlike today's cigarette ads for its complete lack of medical warnings and advisories

Ford looks to appeal to an upper-middle-class consumer with its Mach 1 ad that is equal parts aspirational and attainable

Considering
 that Don has an extensive past, which includes his original identity as
 Dick Whitman, it’s likely that he would have rolled his eyes at this 
line aimed at those who are more naïve.

The
 luxury products in Playboy’s glossy pages would have been published at 
the tail end of the Sixties’ economic prosperity, which would soon wind 
down in the following decade when an oil crisis, exceeding inflation, 
and declining manufacturing rates would hit the U.S.

In
 1969, the United States was also in the midst of the Vietnam War. The 
ads published in Playboy exhibit how those Stateside were often 
disconnected from the troops battling in horrific conditions many miles 
away.

Rise shaving lotion's ad evokes the Sixties' feminine ideals of big hair, doe-eyes, and a baby face

Lejon Vermouth's approach to advertising is incredibly straightforward, while also utilizing the long-form style of copy that was so popular in the pre-Internet era

Gilette's advertisement speaks to the hardships of the Vietnam War, still in full thrall in 1969

Mad
 Men’s seventh and final season debuted on April 13. The season has been
 split into two parts, with the first seven episodes running through the
 end of May, and the remainder airing next year.

The Emmy-award winning show first premiered in 2007.

Antique bourbon's hedonistic imagery perhaps aims to rope in a more rambunctious type of consumer

Cigarettes, this time a brand called Sail from Holland, looks to draw consumers by providing them with incentive to try the foreign brand
