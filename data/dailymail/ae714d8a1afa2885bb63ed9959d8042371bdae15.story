It is a terrifying moment for any man - as they lean down on one knee and fumble to open that tiny velvet box... their whole future dependent on the answer to a four-word question. 

But now it has become clear just how risky proposing to the woman you love really is. 

A new survey has shown that nearly one in four women have turned down at least one marriage proposal during their lifetime.  

A new survey has revealed that one in four women have turned down a marriage proposal in their lifetime, with the top reason being that the man wasn't 'The One' (picture posed by models) 

The most common reasons are because they feared the proposer wasn't 'the one', that it 'didn't feel right' or that their partner wasn't taking the proposal seriously enough.

Others even said they have rejected a proposal because they thought it was nothing more than a joke.

But 23 per cent of people who have declined a proposal admitted they'd regretted the decision later on.

It also emerged 59 per cent of men feel nervous at the prospect of proposing to their partner, with 15 per cent admitting that the thought made them break out in a cold sweat.

Almost one in three women also revealed that they would turn down a marriage proposal if the man hadn't gone to enough effort while popping the question (pictured posed by model)

One man even recorded his own heart rate leading up to, during and after proposing during a break to Rome, with his pulse spiking at 131 beats a minute as he got down on one knee.

A spokesperson for travel firm SuperBreak, who commissioned the research, said: 'We realise that proposing is a big decision for most people and the survey results clearly show this.

'It can take a long time to pluck up the courage to pop the question and to not hear the answer you are hoping for can be difficult.

'And it seems many women will turn down a proposal simply because it wasn't done in the way they were hoping.

'So if you are planning to propose, make sure you have an idea of what your partner would like and hopefully you will be celebrating hearing 'yes'.' 

Of the 2,000 Brits questioned over their proposal experiences, 37 of women revealed they had been proposed to  twice in their lifetime and 12 per cent admitted men had asked for their hand in marriage no less than three times.

1. I wasn't certain they were the one

2. It just didn't feel right

3. I don't/didn't want to get married

4. It didn't feel like they meant it

5. I didn't think we'd been in a relationship long enough

6. We'd already split up and they were trying to win me back

7. I was worried about what other people would think

8. I didn't think we could afford it

9. I thought it was a joke

10. I didn't think my partner was taking it seriously enough

While issues over the condition of the relationship were most likely to solicit a 'no' from the woman in question, the research has shown that the effort that goes into the proposal is also a big factor.  

 29 per cent of women admitted they would turn down their partner just on the basis of the proposal itself being poor.

52 per cent revealed they were hoping for a traditional 'down on one knee' proposal and 20 per cent wanted an 'all-singing, all-dancing' proposal. 

It also emerged just 22 per cent of men actually planned to, or did, spend the traditional two months' salary on a ring for their partner.

One in ten men don't intend to spend a great amount on a ring saying that they 'don't see the need for a ring.'

The study found the most romantic destinations for proposing to a partner are Paris, Venice and Rome.
