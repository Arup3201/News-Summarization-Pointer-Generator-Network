The weekend arrest of Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman - the brutal leader of the Sinaloa Mexican cartel and the countries most dangerous drug lord - is unlikely to put a dent in drug trafficking and may even fuel more violence as power struggles erupt, experts have warned.

Mexican Marines stormed a condominium in the resort city of Mazatlan on Saturday and arrested Guzman, whose elusiveness after a 2001 escape from prison and $5 million bounty on his head elevated him to folklore status, NBC News reported.

Guzman built an empire while on the lam and even made Forbes list of billionaires.

His success was celebrated with a folk song.

In recent years, he eluded authorities by scurrying to safety in a warren of underground tunnels.

'When most of America thinks of organized crime, they naturally think of guys like John Gotti, Sammy ‘the Bull’ Gravano, even guys like Al Capone,' Michael Braun, former chief of operations for the DEA told NBC News.

'But the reality of the situation is Chapo Guzman made those guys look like absolute Boy Scouts.'

Some tens of thousands of people have died under Guzman's reign in drug-related violence.

Experts say Guzman had a hand not only in drug trafficking but also the smuggling of guns and people across the border.

But Gregory D. Lee, a retired supervisory special agent for the DEA and now criminal justice consultant based in Pebble Beach, Calif., told NBC News that Guzman’s arrest will have 'no impact whatsoever' on the flow of drugs from Mexico to the United States.

Most wanted: Guzman is one of the most wanted men in the world and is considered the 'Osama bin Laden of the drug war'

'As long as there’s a demand for drugs, people like El Chapo and his cohorts are going to continue to fill that demand,' Lee said.

According to the State Department, Mexican drug gangs send between $19 billion and $29 billion worth of drugs each year into the United States, including marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine and, increasingly, heroin.

The amount of heroin seized at the Southwest border grew 232 percent — 559 kilograms to 1,855 kilograms — between 2008 to 2012, according to U.S. National Seizure System data.

Guzman's capture also allows for rival gangs to seize control of the drug flow into the States.

Escape: Guzman escaped from a Mexican prison in 2001 by hiding in a laundry bin. Authorities believe he had inside help

Guillermo Valdes, former chief of the Mexican intelligence agency told Bloomberg news service that a top lieutenant, Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada, is the likely successor to Guzman as leader of the Sinoloa Cartel.

'El Mayo has been leading the Sinaloa Cartel alongside El Chapo for 25 years,' Valdes told the news service.

'He’s very intelligent.'

Guzman will face a host of charge in Mexico related to his rile as Sinaloa boss as well as grand injuries in at least seven U.S. federal district courts, including Chicago, San Diego, New York and Texas, who have come forward with indictments since his arrest.
