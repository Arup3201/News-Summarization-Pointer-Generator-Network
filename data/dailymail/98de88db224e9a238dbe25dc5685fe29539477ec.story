International titles and adoration can go to a person's head but a Spanish soldier who was voted one of the hottest men in the world is determined to keep his boots on the ground.

Despite winning the Mr Universe title recently, Ruben Lopez has vowed to continue learning and stick with his career in the army instead of seeking bigger or better things.

Mr Lopez, who was born in Navas de San Juan, defeated 40 participants from all over the world to be crowned Mr Universe last September in Lima, Peru.

The 22 year-old joined the Spanish Army in 2011 and he was subsequently posted in the Armoured Brigade Guadarrama XII at the El Goloso military base in Madrid.

Mr Lopez, was assigned to the RBA Section (telecommunications) from the Signals Company.

Despite having being named the most handsome man in the world, Mr López has no intention of giving up his army profession. 

He has been studying for his degree in physical education and working as a model.

In 2013, the military man won the Beauty of Spain contest.

In a brief video that provides a glimpse into his day job, Mr Lopez said he is just another person to those who know him.

The soldier said: 'I am still the same and I will be. Here in my work I am still just one more soldier. I still need to make efforts day by day and keep learning and improving.' 

The new Mr Universe, who has worked in the fashion industry since he was 14 years old, is treated as 'just another soldier' even though he is very handsome, according to female soldier Lorena Pozas Martin.

She said: 'He is one more among us but we have that feeling of "Wow, we are working with Mr Universe!" But, I don’t know, he is just one of us.'

During the video Mr Lopez can be seen doing push-ups, running with colleagues, lifting weights, and putting on his boots, shirt and beret.

The soldier can also be seen drinking coffee with colleagues, putting stairs on a military vehicle, working with an antenna and watching a leopard tank passing by.
