She may be a heavyweight politician, but Angela Merkel has never looked so lightweight.

Her noticeably slimmer figure is apparently down to observance of a strict new diet.

The result is that she has lost around one and half stone, with pictures of her taken this year and last highlighting the difference her perseverance has made.

The previously favoured cheese and sausage sandwiches and biscuits are now strictly off limits, with the German Chancellor, 59, now munching on fruit and vegetable snacks instead, according to Germany's Bild newspaper.

A story it ran this week asked why Mrs Merkel was looking so slim – and quoted White House correspondents who said that she was looking ‘much more fresh and sporty’ during her visit to the U.S capital last week.

She has reportedly asked for any tempting sandwiches and biscuits to be put beyond arm’s reach.

Bild said: ‘At meetings, she now has a bowl full of raw chopped carrots, red and green peppers and leeks sitting in front of her. She has given instructions that the plates full of sandwiches for other members of her party should be taken out of her reach.’

Her will power drew praise from Italian mountaineer Reinhold Messner, who guided Mrs Merkel on a South Tirol hiking trip last summer.

He claimed that she could walk for six hours without stopping for food.

During Mrs Merkel's visit to the White House she and President Barack Obama put their differences over the U.S.'s spying program aside and threatened tougher and broader new sanctions against Moscow if it doesn't quickly change its disruptive behavior in Ukraine.

'We will not have a choice but to move forward with additional more-severe sanctions' if Russia disrupts a presidential election in Ukraine scheduled for May 25, Obama said at a news conference with Merkel outside the White House early Friday afternoon.

This was the first time the two world leaders had met since the Edward Snowden document leak that revealed the U.S. National Security Agency had been listening to Merkel's personal cell phone calls for more than a decade.

In October, Obama promised that the U.S. was no longer hacking her personal calls. That courtesy does not apply to other residents of Germany, including other German officials, however.
