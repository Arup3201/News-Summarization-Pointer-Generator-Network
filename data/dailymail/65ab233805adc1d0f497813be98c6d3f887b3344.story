They may be known as fast and vicious killers, but it seems even the king of beasts needs a cat nap every now and again.

These pictures show the soft side of one of nature's deadliest predators as a lion has a nap in a tree.

The shots were taken in the Maasai Mara national reserve in Kenya by designer Mark Bridger.

British photographer Mark Bridger captured the sleeping cat while on safari in the country

Mark, 45, was in Kenya for seven days after winning a photography competition and was amazed to get these shots of a the lazy lion.

Mark, from West Malling, Kent said: 'I was on safari for seven days and I was waking up at 6am every day and staying out for about ten hours in order to take the perfect shots.

'We were in a safari jeep with no sides when I spotted the lionness up the tree.

'Maasai Mara is one of the only places on the planet where lions sleep in trees. It just doesn't really happen outside of Kenya so it was great to see.'

Mr Bridger says he woke up every morning at 6am and stayed up for ten hours in order to get the perfect shots

Lions sleeping in trees, while not unheard of, is not common. They prefer to sleep in packs on the ground

Mark took his photographs of the lazy lionness from the safety of the Jeep, and the docile big cat didn't even notice.

Mark said: 'If I had stepped out of the Jeep I am told she would have jumped out of the tree and killed me for sure.

'It was amazing to see such a power creature looking so lazy, hiding up in the tree. I'm glad I managed to capture the moment.'

Lions are mostly active around dusk, when they hunt, or at night, and spend most of the day time asleep

Mr Bridger took the pictures from a Jeep while in the Maasai Mara, one of the few places lions sleep in trees

Lions are most active at night, or just after dusk when they hunt in short sharp bursts of activity, and spend up to 70 per cent of the rest of the day asleep.

In order to escape the heat of the savannah where they live, they will often lay down in long grass or shelter under dense shrubs.

Sleeping in trees in unusual behaviour for the species, which prefers to nap in packs on the ground.
