A 23-year-old has been charged with criminal damage and trespassing after a man was seen wandering on the roof of the Houses of Parliament last night.   

Braydon Liam Anderson  is accused of spending eight hours on top of the historic landmark on Saturday night with police, fire engines and specialist negotiators scrambled to the scene. 

It is not clear where he was part of a climate change protest staged earlier in the day which saw several others arrested. 

Scotland Yard confirmed on Sunday that Anderson, from Northampton, had been charged with criminal damage and trespassing. He will appear in Magistrates' Court on Monday.

Braydon Liam  Anderson, 23, has been charged with criminal damage and trespassing after a man was seen wandering on the roof of the Houses of Parliament last night

Police and fire fighters descended on the Palace of Westminster at about 9.15pm on Saturday after the alarm was raised

Anderson was charged on Sunday after tourists reported seeing a man walking up and down the roof for hours. On Sunday afternoon it was still unclear how the man gained access.

It came after around 5,000 protesters gathered for a climate change demonstration outside Parliament on Saturday afternoon.  

It is still not clear whether the man was staging a protest or not. Anderson will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court tomorrow.  

The man was seen calmly walking around on the roof of the building before being arrested by police. It remains unclear how he got there  

Specialist negotiators were dispatched to the scene last night - but police said there was no suspicion of a suicide attempt

Eyewitnesses described seeing emergency services on the roof of the Palace of Westminster on Saturday night after police were called

Tourists  stopped to look up at the man as he wandered around the landmark's roof. On Sunday he remained in police custody

Specialist negotiators were called to the scene to communicate with the man who was later arrested unharmed.

He is not believed to have given a reason for why he scaled the building or how he got there.

Tourists stopped to observe the unfolding situation last night, with many pondering how he was able to gain access to the building.

One witness told the Daily Telegraph: 'He's just walking up and down, looking a bit vacant.'

'Tourists are stopping to look. He doesn't have any flags or banners.'

Two fire engines from Soho and one fire and rescue unit from Chelsea attended the incident, according to London Fire Service.

A Scotland Yard spokeswoman confirmed Metropolitan Police officers and the London Fire Brigade were on the scene to deal with the incident

Security alert: The man appeared calm but described as 'vacant' by onlooking tourists who questioned how he got up onto the roof

Flashback: In 2009, more than 20 Greenpeace activists managed to climb on to the roof of the Palace of Westminster to stage a protest

On Saturday a spokesman for the House of Commons said: 'The incident is currently being investigated by police. We will wait and see the outcome of that before we proceed.' 

The roof has been the scene of stunts by campaign groups in the past, including by protesters demonstrating against plans for a third runway at Heathrow Airport in 2008.

A year later more than 20 Greenpeace activists climbed on to the roof of the Palace of Westminster in a protest over climate change.

It was reported at the time that protesters managed to slide ladders through the railings surrounding the building and then use them to climb on to one of the lower roofs. 

The demonstrators also scaled the ramparts and a turret on top of Westminster Hall, unfurling yellow banners which read: 'Change the politics, save the climate.' 

Fathers 4 Justice campaigner Guy Harrison, 38, spent five hours on top of Westminster Hall in 2005 with a banner which read: 'Does Blair care?' 

New Fathers 4 Justice said it did not know the name of the Westminster protester but confirmed that a protest was being planned for Westminster.

Members of the campaign group visited the site last week and a spokesman said: 'With many MP's away pre election campaigning security around Parliament appeared noticeably much more relaxed than unusual last week.'

Their plan involved a 'sympathetic insider who works as a researcher for a Lib Dem MP' but they refused to hand over any money.
