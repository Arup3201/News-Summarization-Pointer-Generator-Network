Cesc Fabregas perks up when he talks about the killer instinct, the ruthless streak that all teams develop at the start of a success story.

On instant recall is the World Cup in 2010, when Spain turned to every available resource to reach the final after titanic struggles against Paraguay in the last eight and Germany in the semi-final.

Fabregas was part of that team, realising a boyhood dream when he lifted the most famous trophy in world football with one of the best sides in history.

Chelsea’s dressing room is developing a winning mentality again, lifting their first trophy together at Wembley 10 days ago when Jose Mourinho’s team won the Capital One Cup. It has given them belief.

‘When you unlock the mental fear of the quarter-final, which is what we did with the national team, we felt we could become champions,’ said Fabregas. ‘Once we were champions we were unstoppable, but you have to take this fear out and take it away. We have to believe we are the best.

‘We have to be ready mentally to win every situation because this game will not be a walk in the park.’

He was talking about Wednesday evening’s opponents Paris Saint-Germain, a tough nut to crack in the Champions League as Laurent Blanc’s team arrive in London protecting an unbeaten run that stretches back to January 10.

Fabregas likes what he sees in the Chelsea dressing room and yet his experience, after nearly 500 appearances for club and country, tells him there is still room for improvement.

‘If there is one thing missing it is killing teams,’ he admitted. ‘Sometimes we don’t kill them when we have the chance.

‘When we score one we have to score more and more. That’s the only way we can really improve, developing that killer instinct.’

Chelsea can smother teams, a tactic Jose Mourinho has refined quite brilliantly over the years with Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid. Fabregas is eager to please his manager as he learns a new, more disciplined position alongside Nemanja Matic in the centre of midfield.

Fabregas loves his football at Chelsea, cheerfully claiming that he is at the top of his game following his move from Barcelona last summer.

‘I have to be more disciplined and you don’t see me in the box so much,’ he added. ‘I am more positional, always behind the ball, always finding solutions for the other players and controlling the tempo.

‘If you asked me 12 months ago whether I would work with Jose I would have said “no”, but you can never say never.

‘Working with Jose, it has been really good so far, but I expected that. I knew he was a great personality and I knew coming to Chelsea, a big club with a big manager, that I would work a lot. I have enjoyed this the most in my career. We need to keep growing as a team.

‘I will give everything for Chelsea to win the Champions League, but it doesn’t mean I can’t sleep at night.

‘For every football player they want to win the World Cup and the Champions League.’

Mourinho has revealed his admiration for Fabregas, pictured in 2006, during his younger years at Arsenal

Mourinho admired the Spain midfielder from afar when he was running the show for Arsenal. Fabregas played in the 2006 Champions League final, alongside Gilberto Silva when Arsenal were beaten by Barcelona after extra time in the Stade de France.

He was in the centre of midfield that night, putting in an arduous shift in the boiler room because Arsenal were down to 10 after the dismissal of goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.

A year later he faced Chelsea in the Carling Cup final, unlucky to lose after a battle royal with some players of pedigree in Mourinho’s side.

‘As a kid he played against our midfield in the League Cup final in 2007 and we had (Michael) Essien, (Claude) Makelele, (Frank) Lampard and (Michael) Ballack, and he was playing fantastic football,’ said Mourinho.

‘I never felt he could work with me because when I was at Chelsea he was at Arsenal and when I was at Real Madrid he was at Barcelona. So it was quite unexpected for me that he wanted to come to Chelsea.’

Now that he is here, they wouldn’t be without him.
