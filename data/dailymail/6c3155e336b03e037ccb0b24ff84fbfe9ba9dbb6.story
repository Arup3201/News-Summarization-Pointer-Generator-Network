Tragedy: Dr Thomas McAfee died after stumbling and being trampled to death by an elephant while on safari in Tanzania

The sister of a former UC San Diego dean who was trampled to death by a herd of elephants while on Safari said that her brother knew the risks of getting close to Africa's wild animals.

Skyli McAfee confirmed that her brother, Dr. Thomas McAfee, 58, had 'an accidental encounter with an elephant' while at Tanzania's 1,096-square-mile Tarangire National Park and tragically died as a result.

Declining to give any more details about her brother's death, McAfee said that her brother was an experienced traveler who had been to Africa many times and knew that elephants were dangerous and unpredictable.

'My brother certainly was aware of those risks, but he was doing what he wanted to do,' said Skyli McAfee to UTSan Diego.

'He was supportive of conservation efforts and his family continues to be.'

The American doctor killed in Tanzania after being trampled to death by an elephant, died because he lost his footing and fell while attempting to run from the animal.

McAfee, 58, a dean at University of California was in Tarangire National Park on a luxury safari when the tragic accident occurred.

The doctor and two unidentified companions were apparently viewing game on foot when they stumbled upon a herd of about 50 elephants.

The trio ran from the herd, but McAfee 'fell down and one of the elephants trampled on him,' reports The Citizen.

‘Sensing danger, the tourists took to their heels, but unfortunately Macfee fell down and one of the elephants trampled on him. He died while receiving treatment at a nearby dispensary,’ acting Manyara Regional Police Commander Mussa Marambo told the newspaper.

It isn't clear whether McAfee and his companions were part of a guided tour or out on their own, although visitors are supposed to be accompanied by armed rangers during walking safaris.

McAfee was enjoying a vacation before starting a new position as chief executive of the Keck Medicine of USC Medical Foundation.

Hi body was taken to the Arusha Lutheran Medical Centre (ALMC) as arrangements were being made to ferry it home.

There is no word yet on when his body will be flown back to the United States.

Elephants are known to make unprovoked attacks on people, but more often they react when they feel that their family is threatened or cornered.

As the world's largest land animal 
weighing up to 15,000 pounds, a charging elephant is a frightening and 
deadly force to be reckoned with.

According
 to Debra Kain, director of Health Sciences Research Communications at 
UC San Diego, the death has come as a huge unexpected shock.

In an email sent to NBC San Diego,
 Mounir Soliman, assistant vice chancellor and executive director of 
Health Sciences International said, 'It's a true tragedy and great loss 
to all of us at UCSD. We are planning several events in celebration of 
Dr. McAfee's life.'

Tarangire
 National Park is the sixth largest national park in Tanzania and covers
 1,100 square miles and is home to 550 species including the giraffe, 
zebra and is noted for the famous termite mounds that dot the landscape.

A luxury safari in the park with accommodation at one of the top lodges in the area can cost up to $1,000 a night.

In
 a varied career at UC San Diego, McAfee was the dean of Clinical 
Affairs for the UC San Diego Health Sciences, as well as chief executive
 officer for UC San Diego Faculty Practice.

According his online biography, McAfee joined UCSD Health Sciences in 2002 as their physician-in-chief.

His former colleages at UC San Diego, David Brenner, MD, Paul Viviano and Larry Friedman, MD, released the following email on Sunday to staff.

'It is with regret and personal sadness that we inform you that Dr. Thomas McAfee, until very recently, the Dean of Clinical Affairs for UC San Diego Health Sciences and CEO for UC San Diego Faculty Practice, was killed in an accident while on vacation in Africa. We have no other details at present,' reads the email.

'Dr. McAfee served us and worked alongside us for more than 11 years, and his death is a great loss – both to many of us personally, and to the field of health care which would have benefited enormously from his talent and dedication in coming years.

'Dr. McAfee was adventurous in spirit, loved to visit new places and to meet new people. A celebration of his life will be held in coming weeks for the Health Sciences community.'

University of California San Diego: McAfee¿s last day with UC San Diego was fairly recent

On Tuesday he was to have begun as CEO of the newly formed Keck Medicine of USC Medical Foundation.

'We can confirm the death of U.S. citizen Thomas McAfee in Tanzania on August 31.  We offer our condolences to his family and loved ones on their loss,' said a spokesman for the U.S. State Department,

'We are in contact with the family and are providing all appropriate consular assistance.

'Out of respect for the privacy of those affected, we decline further comment.'

McAfee was set to begin a new job at the University of Southern California this Tuesday, Sept. 3, as the CEO of the Keck Medicine of USC Medical Foundation

Leslie Ridgeway, director of media relations for Keck Medical Center of USC, released the following statement Sunday afternoon for Thomas Jackiewicz, senior vice president and CEO of USC Health:

'We are devastated by this news,' said Jackiewicz.

'Tom was a dear friend of mine and a respected colleague. His contributions to health care were numerous, and he was excited about the opportunity to begin a new chapter of his life and career helping us propel USC forward in its health-care growth.

'The world has lost a kind and talented individual far too soon.'
