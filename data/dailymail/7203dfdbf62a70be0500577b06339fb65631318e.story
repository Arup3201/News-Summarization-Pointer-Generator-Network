A group of Oxford University students who became an internet sensation with their cover of a Shakira hit are back with their own spin on a classic Christmas tune.

The all-male choir, known as Out of the Blue, has produced an a cappella version of Mariah Carey’s All I Want For Christmas Is You in support of charity.

And just like they did with their cover of Shakira’s Hips Don’t Lie, the young men have put together a music video for their growing fan base.

The group's music video blends solo performances, dance routines and a few lighter moments

The clip has received nearly 100,000 views on YouTube since it was uploaded earlier in the week.

With people in the giving spirit over the holidays the 13-member choir is hoping to raise as much cash as it can for Helen and Douglas House, the world’s first children’s hospice.

It provides palliative, respite, end-of-life and bereavement care to children and young adults with terminal illnesses, and their families.

People can support Helen and Douglas House by downloading the group’s charity Christmas single.

The YouTube video shows the choir performing solos and dance routines around campus with a few bits of comedy sprinkled in for added enjoyment.

As their rendition of All I Want For Christmas Is You comes to an end, the choir switches to a fun version of Santa Claus Is Coming To Town.

Earlier this year, the group scored a massive hit with its cover of Shakira’s Hips Don’t Lie, and the accompanying music video went viral.

The video has more than five million views, giving the choir a new legion of fans. It shows the singers wearing suits and shaking their hips to the tune in the historic grounds of the university.

Shakira even tweeted a link to her 26 million followers and a message telling the group that she loved their medley.

Founded in 2000, Out of the Blue is made up of students from Oxford and Oxford Brookes universities with a roster that changes every year.

The choir has toured the UK and made appearances at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, and it reached the semi-finals of Britain’s Got Talent in 2011.
