Former Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino is unsure whether Lionel Messi will ever hit top form again watching his compatriot struggle to make a impact in consecutive La Liga defeats to Real Madrid and Celta Vigo.

Despite scoring seven league goals in 10 games this season, Messi has failed to reach the heights he managed under the tutelage of Pep Guardiola between 2008 and 2012.

And Martino, who left Barca at the end of last season after just a year at the club, believes the 27-year-old may no longer be able to play at the level he once did.

Former Barca boss Gerardo Martino believes hsi compatriot Messi may never recapture his best form

Appearances: 11

Goals: 9

Assists: 9 

Chances created: 44 

Pass accuracy: 84.5 per cent 

Martino told Marca: 'Any comparison with the two-to-three-year period in which he was at his best [is unfair]. It's very difficult to get back to that sort of level after so long.

'I don't know if we'll have the chance to see it happen. It's like when people compare Barcelona now to what they were like under Guardiola.'

Messi will look to forget his side's successive defeats in La Liga when Barca take on Ajax in the Champions League at the Amsterdam Arena on Wednesday night.

Luis Enrique's men are second in Group F behind Paris Saint-Germain but know three points in Holland will all but secure their safe passage to the knockout stages of the competition.
