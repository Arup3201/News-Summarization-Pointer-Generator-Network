A seven-year-old boy who asked Santa for a new heart is recovering after receiving a life-saving transplant.

Micah Muller, from Waynesburg, Ohio, was born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, a rare condition that affects blood flow to the heart. After complications last September, he was admitted to the hospital and put on the heart transplant waiting list a month later.

Micah, who wasn't expected to live through the New Year, received a new heart on December 20 - just in time for Christmas.

Gift of life: Micah Muller asked Santa for a new heart and received a life-saving organ transplant just five days before Christmas

'It's amazing,' Micah's mother LaVonne Dougherty told  Fox 8 News Cleveland. 'It's surreal. Never though that we would be here. Never thought it.'

One of the doctors at the Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital said Micah had been dying after 'a lifetime of being sick' prior to the surgery.

Ms Dougherty admitted that she struggled with her emotions when her son was put on the heart transplant waiting list.

'Just the idea of: “Okay. Am I wishing for another child to die - you know another family's worst tragedy - to save my own?”' she said. 'Psychologically it could do a number for you.'

Now Micah's goal is to go home with his mom and play with his three older sisters, Cassie, Madeline and Julie.

Micah, who has been fighting for his life since the day he was born, had his first surgery when he was one week old. He faced another soon after, and by the time he was five months old, he had endured a total of three surgeries.  

Unwavering support: After being admitted to the Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital last September, Micah was visited by Batman, as well as LeBron James and other members of the Cleveland Cavaliers

Although his condition limited his physical abilities, Micah lived at home and attended school at Sandy Valley Elementary before he was admitted into the hospital last September.

Throughout his stay at the Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital, Micah has received visits from Spider-Man, Batman and Thor, as well as LeBron James and other Cleveland Cavaliers players.

Last December, Micah's school principal Vic Johnson told The Press-News that his student is an inspiration.

'Micah is one of the most amazing young people I have ever met,' he said. 'Courage and energy are two words directly associated to him.He has taken on this challenge since birth, never wavering.'

Mr Johnson added: 'He's full of life every minute of the day. You can't help but smile when you're around him.'
