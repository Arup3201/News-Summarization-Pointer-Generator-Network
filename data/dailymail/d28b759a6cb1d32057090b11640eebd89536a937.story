A radical Polish nationalist has been arrested on suspicion of plotting to detonate four tonnes of explosives outside his country's parliament while the president and prime minister were inside.

Polish officials said the suspect was a scientist who had a 'fascination' with Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik, who killed 77 people in bomb and gun attacks last year.

The 45-year-old was arrested after analysis of Breivik's contacts abroad helped lead Polish investigators to him.

A video recording taken from the suspect 
showed what prosecutors said was a test explosion he conducted, leaving a
large crater in the ground.

'The case looks very serious': This gun was among a cache of weapons and explosives allegedly assembled by a Polish nationalist suspected of planning to detonate a bomb outside the country's parliament

Sophisticated: The alleged arsenal collected by the scientist included remote-controlled detonators which are triggered by mobile phones

A collection of manuals on mines, bombs and ammunition was recovered and a video recording taken from the suspect allegedly showed a test explosion he conducted

Prosecutors said the scientist works for a university in the southern city of Krakow and had assembled a 
small arsenal of explosive material, guns and remote-controlled 
detonators and was trying to recruit others to help him.

Polish television, citing sources close to the investigation, said the suspect planned to copy methods used by Breivik said he was driven by far-right views like the Norwegian.

Prime Minister Donald Tusk told a news conference: 'The would-be bomber did not hide his fascination with Breivik. This should not be ignored.Â  This should be a warning and a good lesson to Poland in the future.

'This is a new and dramatic experience. So far, we have had no experience with these kind of incidents.'

'In the planning': Prosecutors claim the suspect carried out reconnaissance in the neighbourhood of the Sejm, the Polish parliament

Tensions: Poland has no experience of militant violence in its modern history, but society is deeply polarised between supporters of liberal values and those who believe the country is neglecting its Catholic roots

New threats: Speaking about the arrest, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said: 'This is a new and dramatic experience. So far, we have had no experience with these kind of incidents'

'Targeting the president': More components for the Polish scientist's alleged bomb plot on his country's parliament

Terrifying: A horde of ball bearings which would likely be added to the bomb material to make them more destructive

Prosecutor Piotr Krason told a news conference that the suspect did not belong to a political group or party.

'He claims that he was acting on nationalistic, anti-Semitic and xenophobic motives,' he said.

'He
carried out reconnaissance in the neighbourhood of the Sejm 
(parliament). This building was to be the target of the attack. He 
collected explosives and materials for detonation.

Poland
has no experience of militant violence in its modern history. Society 
is though deeply polarised between supporters of liberal values and 
those who believe the country is neglecting its Catholic roots and 
succumbing to foreign influence.

Earlier
this month, a rally in the capital, Warsaw, by right-wing nationalists 
turned violent, when youths in the crowd started throwing flares and 
stones at police.

'Target': Poland's Parliament in Warsaw, where the terror suspect was allegedly planning to detonate four tonnes of explosives while the country's top politicians were inside

Earlier on Tuesday, prosecutors said 
they had initiated legal proceedings against the bomb plot suspect on 
Nov. 5 and that Poland's Internal Security Agency would handle the case.

'The case looks very serious,' Pawel 
Gras, a government spokesman, told TOK FM radio station. 'We know that 
the possible targets were to be the president, the parliament and the 
government.'

Polish society 
is deeply polarised between liberals and those who believe the country 
is neglecting its Catholic roots and succumbing to foreign influence.

Most
right-wing groups renounce violence, but some on the margins are more 
radical. A rally in the capital, Warsaw, this month by right-wing 
nationalists turned violent, when youths in the crowd started throwing 
flares and stones at police.

Prosecutors produced evidence suggesting the unidentified suspect was planning a sophisticated attack.

They showed reporters photographs of pistols and bags of ammunition which they said he had bought in Poland and in Belgium.

They also showed several vehicle licence plates, both Polish and foreign, which they said had been found among his belongings.

They said the suspect had used his scientific background to assemble the explosives himself. 'He is a specialist in the field,' prosecutor Krason said.

Officials said that they had found explosive substances including hexogen and tetryl, as well as detonators that could be triggered remotely using a mobile telephone.

The dean of the Agricultural University in Krakow, where prosecutors said the arrested man worked, said the man had never given any reason for suspicion.

'It never occurred to us that at our school there could be a person involved in such matters. There were no indications from his co-workers that anything unusual was happening,' Roman Sady said.
