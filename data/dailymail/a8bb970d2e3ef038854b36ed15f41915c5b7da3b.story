A former opium addict has described his 20-year love affair with the drug and the vomit therapy that cured him in a tell-all book.

At the peak of his addiction, Steven Martin, now 50, would smoke up to 30 pipes per day and was unable to leave his home at night for fear he might not get a fix.

'Opium Fiend, A 21st Century Slave to a 
19th Century Addiction' opens with this harrowing description of the 
American author trying to cut himself off from a drug that had taken 
over his life as a freelance journalist in Southeast Asia.

Anything for a hit: In this photo taken in mid 2007, Steven Martin himself smokes opium in the living room of his apartment in Chinatown in Bangkok when he had a twenty-pipe-per-day opium habit

Describing the first time he tried to get help in the late 1990s, he said: 'After seven years of curious dabbling I had awoken from my pleasant 
dream and found myself a voracious opium fiend with a 30-pipe-a-day 
habit.'

He tells how, one Halloween night, in a blacked-out bedroom in Bangkok's Chinatown, he went into physical and mental free fall.

High fever oscillated with shivering cold, gut-wrenching stomach pains brought on waves of diarrhea.

Howling in agony, he leapt around the room in a kind of devil dance, his body smeared with oily sweat, vomit, mucus and feces.

It was then that he joined Thailand's Tham Krabok Monastery, where 
hundreds of Thai and foreign addicts have sought treatment through 
Buddhist monastic discipline and a vomit-inducing herbal drink in what he calls 'Thai puking rehab'.

'Hell on earth': A Western drug addict pauses over the trough during induced vomiting to detoxify her body at the Tham Krabok monastery in Thailand. Martin says their screams were so loud they could be heard in the local town

'Here,' he wrote in The Fix, 'under the auspices of monks, novices, and nuns in toga-like robes,
you will find scores of recovering drug addicts from countries all over
the globe, ready to take a particularly unpalatable cure involving five
days of induced high-intensity vomiting.'

He describes being told to kneel with other addicts over a trough and handed a shot glass containing a 'muddy potion' to drink. The result 'brought forth torrents of rust-colored puke [...] until the deluge became dry heaves.'

This ritual was repeated every day 'while a crowd of spectators sang songs to conga-drum rhythms and cavorted about while we gagged and retched'.

Such is the nature of coming off opium in this way, he said people who lived near the 
monastery 'used to complain that at night they could hear the addicts’ 
screams all the way into town'.

Although Martin doesn't advocate opium use, his memoir is no simple cautionary tale, nor was he your average backpacker junkie, such as still roam this region of cheap and plentiful drugs.

After intensive research, Martin says he never found a detailed, honest account by an opium addict, even during the drug's heyday.

'And as a result of the almost 
complete eradication of opium smoking in the traditional Chinese manner,
it seemed that such a book never could be written — that the subject 
had been lost to history,' he said in an interview.

'I knew that my experiences were uncommon. I simply wanted to share my story.'

It's
one that in equal measure details both the bliss the drug induced — 
'never again would sleep be so delicious; never again would dreams be so
real' — and the pain of dependence and repeated attempts at withdrawal.

Five years later, now living in Los 
Angeles, the 50-year-old author acknowledges the drug's continuing siren
call — as do experts on addiction.

'I think about opium every day — 
that's no exaggeration,' he says. 'While sleeping I dream about smoking 
opium, and sometimes I wake up from these dreams lying on my left side, 
in the same exact position that an opium smoker who is right-handed like
myself would lie in order to prepare and smoke his pipes.'

Dr. Christian Brule, a French doctor 
who coordinated drug policy at the Council of Europe, agrees that opium 
addiction is extremely difficult to shed, both physically and 
psychologically, the craving still there decades after the last pipe is 
smoked.

Big business: A Thai soldier displays opium poppies at a hilly area of Tak province during an annual search and destroy opium eradication operation. Steven describes it as 'a habit that had financed empires and made fortunes all over the world'

'We call it the syndrome of lost heaven,' he says.

Martin
traces his addiction to childhood, when he exhibited a more than normal
penchant for collecting things and an allure for exotic Asian 
artifacts.

After a stint in the U.S. Navy he moved to the Philippines and then Thailand, home for 18 years.

His introduction to opium came in 1992 in Laos, where the last of the old Chinese-style opium dens still existed.

'Opium smoking, a habit that had financed empires and made fortunes all
over the world, was now so rare that only in this landlocked backwater 
could the classic Chinese vice be witnessed,' he writes.

It's
still around in Southeast Asia today, but mainly used by elderly 
hilltribe people and young Westerners seeking a quick, exotic thrill 
while trekking in northern Thailand or hanging out in backpacker 
destinations like Vang Vieng in Laos.

The so-called Golden Triangle, which 
includes areas of Laos, Myanmar and northern Thailand, remains the 
world's number two opium producer although Afghanistan accounts for some
75 per cent of the crop.

But
almost everywhere the opium is refined into heroin, which has 
supplanted the ancient opiate, along with designer drugs and sometimes 
morphine.

'Only very 
particular personalities still go into this hellish opium experience 
these days,' says Brule, who has also worked with addicts while helming 
several international organizations related to narcotics.

What
hooked Martin initially was not the drug itself but obsessive amassment
of pipes, lamps and other opium-smoking paraphernalia.

He eventually gathered one of the world's largest collections, wrote a book on the subject and pursued scholarly research into opium's history, culture and abiding romantic image.

An opium pipe became for him a thing of rare beauty and 'symbol of the old Orient — as archaic as rickshaws, Chinese junks and man-eating tigers.'

Closer to home, he came upon the largely forgotten fact that in the 19th and early 20th century the United States was awash with opium. There were dens in Manhattan and popular songs like 'Fast Asleep in Poppyland.' "Yen", was originally used to mean a craving for opium.

Along the way, Martin's occasional, recreational pipe led to a powerful addiction.

Martin doesn't hold back when describing the pleasures he drew from the drug. He experienced 'a welling euphoria followed by a serene sense of well-being washing over me like a succession of tender caresses.'

'Opium is a charismatic lover who takes 
you to heaven, giving you years of warmth and affection, and then, like a
schizophrenic, inexplicably and without warning begins putting you 
through hell'

- Steven Martin, former opium addict and author of 'Opium Fiend'

A few pipes made him feel he could recapture childhood's boundless optimism and wonder at the world.

'Opium is a charismatic lover who takes you to heaven, giving you years of warmth and affection, and then, like a schizophrenic, inexplicably and without warning begins putting you through hell,' he notes.

And Martin was entering the lower depths, rooted to his apartment, his work neglected, afraid to be away for even a single night lest he go without a fix.

The death of a close companion in 2008 - possibly from sudden opium withdrawal - hit him hard.

He had often smoked up to 30 pipes a day with Roxanna Brown, who remains a local legend for her expertise in Southeast Asian ceramics and her tragic life.

A Vietnam War reporter, she lived in constant pain after losing a leg in a car accident and died in a U.S. prison where guards failed to provide her with medical care.

Charges of alleged fraud involving smuggling of Thai antiques were dropped, the U.S. government paying compensation to her family.

With the help of his detox at Tham Krabok Monastery he has freed himself from opium's grip.

But the last line of his book is no ode to deliverance: 'When the cravings get particularly keen, I tell myself that when health is lost to disease or old age, I will find a way to once again to light the lamp, take up the pipe, and roll myself into sweet oblivion.'
