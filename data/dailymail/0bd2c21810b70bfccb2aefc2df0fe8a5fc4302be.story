The mum of a 15-month-old toddler who got a coin lodged in his throat has described how lucky she feels that her son survived the drama.

Lesley Pattinson, 39, from Fylingdales, North Yorkshire had to rush to save her son Harry after he began to cough and retch after something got stuck in his throat.

The quick-thinking mum said that she was at home with her son Harry who was sitting on the carpet at the other end of the living room when she saw him pick up something on the floor, put it in his mouth and swallow it.

Lucky boy: Harry Pattinson stands with his mum Lesley who saved him when he nearly choked after accidentally swallowed a penny

X-Ray: The X-Ray shows a one pence piece stuck in little Harry's throat which he accidentally put it in his mouth

What's this mum: Little Harry looks at the one pence piece that he put in his mouth which is now safely in a toddler proof container which he will not be able to open

She said: 'It
 was like it happened in slow motion - before I could stop him he had 
already swallowed the coin. It's so strange because he's usually such a cautious
 little boy, he's not one to throw himself into something without 
checking with me first, usually he'd show me what he'd found rather than putting it straight into his mouth.

'I rushed over to him and he was coughing, choking. His lips started to turn a little bit blue. He was retching. It was really scary and just horrendous, but as strange as it sounds, I was really calm about it all.

'I'm not first aid trained but I think as a mother you see all sorts of things, and
 I knew that I needed to stay calm. It was my job to stay calm and 
reassure him. If I had panicked we wouldn't have got anything done 
sooner.

'I
 picked him up and tried to soothe him, while thinking about what I 
should do. After just a couple of minutes, he seemed to calm down. He 
wasn't gasping for breath, he seemed to be quite relaxed, but I knew that I needed to get him to hospital.

However, the family lives in a remote area so help was not readily available so she had to do all that she could at home at that very moment.

She added: 'It's a miracle he survived really. The coin was lodged right at the top of his throat. Luckily it went down his food pipe instead of his windpipe, otherwise the outcome could have been horribly different.

'But because it was so close to the top of the pipe, at any moment it could have flipped up and gone down his windpipe.

The full time mum lives with her partner Dennis Shaw, 42, and her other three children Marcus Pattinson, 11, Declan Pattinson, ten, and nine-year-old George.

Super mum: Lesley Pattinson said she is not first aid trained but knew that she needed to stay calm

She added: 'I decided not to ring for an ambulance because we live in such a rural area that I know it takes so long for an ambulance to get to us, so I got in the car and drove us to Whitby A&E.

They rushed straight up to X-ray and from the picture they could see that the coin was lodged right at the top of Harry's throat.

She remembers that she tried to keep him calm so the coin wasn't dislodged, but her son seemed to be fine and quite happy.

She added: 'The doctors decided they had to send him to a hospital with a specialist anaesthetist for children.

'We waited for an ambulance and then it took about half an hour to get to the hospital, so we arrived at James Cook [hospital] around three hours after he swallowed the coin.

'As soon as we got there they took him up to theatre and gave him a general anaesthetic, and pulled the object out with what I think were like some pincers. Thankfully, they didn't have to make any cuts.

'When he came round, he was fine. We gave him some milk and because he'd kept it down they said to us that after a few hours he was fine to go home.Since then he's been absolutely fine.

The grateful mother realises that her quick thinking actions saved her child's life and she said that she can't believe she was so calm, but she knew that panicking wouldn't help.

She said: 'You're all a child has got in that moment to sort things out for them, that was my job and I'm glad it ended so well.'

'I feel very lucky that we've got a happy ending - it just makes you appreciate what you've got, really.'
