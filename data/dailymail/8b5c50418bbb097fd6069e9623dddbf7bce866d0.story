Fifty-three people have been wounded in a car bomb in a Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut as Britain announces £50m aid to help Syrian refugees in Lebanon.

Blast: Eighteen people have been wounded in a car bomb in a Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut, Lebanon

Destruction: The blast occurred this morning in the south suburbs which are dominated by the Lebanese Shi'ite Hezbollah militant group that has been fighting in Syria's civil war, security sources said

Target:: The blast was apparently targeted a shopping mall in the Bir al-Abed area

Verdict: 'This is the work of agents trying to create strife in Lebanon,' said Hezbollah parliamentary Deputy Ali Meqdad at the site of the explosion

Tensions in Lebanon have been high following the intervention of Hezbollah in support of President Bashar al-Assad's forces fighting a two-year revolt led by Syria's Sunni Muslim majority.

'This is the work of agents trying to create strife in Lebanon,' said Hezbollah parliamentary Deputy Ali Meqdad at the site of the explosion.

A Reuters reporter on the scene saw a large fire raging at the site of the blast, which apparently targeted a shopping mall in the Bir al-Abed area.

The area is also home to many Hezbollah political offices.

Climate: Tensions in Lebanon have been high following the intervention of Hezbollah in support of President Bashar al-Assad's forces fighting a two-year revolt led by Syria's Sunni Muslim majority

Emergency: Civil Defence members extinguish the fire. Fires were raging from dozens of cars which were set ablaze in the parking lot where the car rigged with explosives was left

Ambulances and fire engines sped through the streets to rescue casualties.

Hezbollah gunmen cordoned off the area of the blast, which damaged cars and buildings.

Fires were raging from dozens of cars which were set ablaze in the parking lot where the car rigged with explosives was left.

'I
haven't heard an explosion like this one since the 1980s(when a car 
bomb targeted Hezbollah's late spiritual leader Sayyed Mohammed Hussein 
Fadlallah)' a woman in southern Beirut said.

Shopping areas would likely have been full today, the day before the Islamic holy month of Ramadan begins.

The attack is the second strike to hit Shi'ite southern Beirut this year.

Attack: A pillar of dense black smoke billowed above surrounding high-rise apartment blocks. Ambulances and fire engines sped through the streets to rescue casualties

Frequency: The attack is the second strike to hit Shi'ite southern Beirut this year. Two rockets hit the area in May and Lebanese security forces have disarmed several rockets near Beirut in recent months as well

Injured: Hezbollah's al-Manar Television said five people were injured when a car bomb exploded in the parking lot of a building housing a religious center and a supermarket in the heavily populated area

Threats: Sunni Muslim militant groups have threatened to carry out attacks against Hezbollah following its military intervention in Syria

Assistance: Men gather near burning cars at the site of an explosion

Two rockets hit the area in May and Lebanese security forces have disarmed several rockets near Beirut in recent months as well.

It was unclear who was behind Tuesday's blast or May's attack.

It was unclear whether any members of the Hezbollah leadership were in the area on Tuesday.

The
last car bomb to hit Beirut targeted a senior intelligence official in 
October. Wissam al-Hassan was part of the country's leading Sunni 
opposition party, which has supported the uprising in Syria.

Syria's
conflagration has polarised Lebanon, a country of four million that is 
still healing from its own 15-year civil war, a conflict that divided 
the country along similar sectarian lines now plaguing Syria.

Lebanon's
Sunni Muslims mostly support the rebels in Syria, while Shi'ites have 
largely supported Assad, who is part of the minority Alawite sect, an 
offshoot of Shi'ite Islam.

Sunni Muslim militant groups have threatened to carry out attacks against Hezbollah following its military intervention in Syria.

Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has promised that his group will continue fighting for Assad after it spearheaded the recapture of the strategic town of Qusair last month.

Nasrallah said Hezbollah was aware of the cost of military engagement in Syria's civil war and would not be deflected from its goal.

Meanwhile today the UK pledged £50 million in aid in an effort to alleviate the humanitarian crisis caused by refugees fleeing the conflict in Syria.

International Development Secretary Justine Greening announced the funding during a visit to Lebanon, which is in danger of being overwhelmed by the influx of people attempting to escape the bloodshed in neighbouring Syria.

The £50 million will help meet emergency food and shelter needs for the 585,000 refugees already in Lebanon and will also be used to strengthen the infrastructure needed to cope with the exodus.

Ms Greening said: 'The number of refugees in Lebanon looks set to double by Christmas. That means that a country half the size of Wales will be hosting over one million refugees. I pay tribute to the generosity of the Lebanese people but this is now a crisis for the region, not just for Syria, and we have got to deal with that reality.

'On top of that, a shocking one in 10 female refugees has suffered violence. I am determined that we must all do more to ensure that we do not lose sight of their particular needs in this wider crisis. Keeping people safe and preventing violence has to be a top priority.'

The money comes from the £175 million to tackle the Syrian crisis announced by Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit last month.

Lebanon now hosts more refugees as a percentage of the population than any other country in the world, with nearly 3,000 more arriving daily.

This is creating tensions around the availability of housing and putting pressure on Lebanon's education and healthcare systems, as well as water, sanitation and other infrastructure.
