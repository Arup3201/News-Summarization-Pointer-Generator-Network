Something strange has materialised on the streets of Leeds.

Twenty-four blue telephone boxes resembling Doctor Who's Tardis have turned up in the city centre.

But don't panic. Multiple incarnations of the Time Lord haven't arrived to protect West Yorkshire from an alien invasion.

The phone boxes are actually an eye-catching way of bringing free wi-fi access to internet users.

The internet hub scheme has been branded 'sci-fi wi-fi' - and the traditional red phone boxes have been painted blue to look just like the Doctor's famous time machine.

The booths have been installed by telecommunications company aql to store network equipment under what it is calling the Leodis project (Leeds Electronic Ordnance and Digital Information System) - appropriate, given that Leodis was the Victorian name of the city.

The boxes are locked and all services are accessed from the outside using touch panels behind glass - allowing the public to make phone calls and gain wi-fi access.

Each 'Tardis' will house a high bandwidth network and is solar powered, avoiding the need to dig up the streets to install electricity and the network.

Telecom company aql has spent £30,000 buying the 1930s' boxes and having them restored

They also feature an interactive screen allowing users to leave video blogs and messages to share their memories about the area where each box is located.

This information will be archived and shared online to contribute to a digital history of the city.

CEO and founder of aql, Dr Adam Beaumont, said: 'We wanted to create an icon for Leeds - something unique which if you had your photo taken next to it and uploaded it, for example, to Facebook, friends would say - "aha! you must be in Leeds!"

'We're hoping that the boxes become something that the residents accept as part of the cityscape.'

The blue painted boxes are 'recycled' classic K6 phone boxes from the 1930s - originally designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, who was also the designer of Battersea Power station, Waterloo Bridge and Liverpool Cathedral - and will allow free wi-fi access to anyone nearby.

Lurene Joseph, chief executive of Leeds 
and Partners, said: 'These boxes are a great illustration of Leeds’ 
digital ability and confidence and will be another excellent part of the
 city’s infrastructure.

'They’re forward looking, innovative but rooted 
in strong traditions and are another example of anambitious young company driving forward enterprise, jobs and opportunity in Leeds.'

Aql has spent £30,000 buying the 1930s' boxes and having them restored. 

The company has also invested in another site on the outskirts of the Leeds suburb Beeston which will allow them to roll out connectivity to areas of Hunslet further south.

The booths have been installed by telecommunications company aql to store network equipment under what it is calling the Leodis project (Leeds Electronic Ordnance and Digital Information System). Leodis is an old name for the city (above)
