Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas told a group of college students on Tuesday that race and gender relations are worse now than when he was a kid in a segregated Georgia.

According to Yahoo News, at Palm Beach Atlantic University in West Palm Beach, Florida, Thomas, the second black justice to serve on the court, lamented how society is more 'conscious' of racial differences than it was when he grew up in segregated Georgia before and during the civil rights era.

The conservative justice who, among other things, has written opinions supporting limits on Affirmative Action, added that 'the worst things that have been done to me, the worst things that have been said about me, by northern liberal elites, not by the people of Savannah, Georgia.'

Speaking out: Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas told a group of college students on Tuesday that race and gender relations are worse now than when he was a kid

The justices of the U.S. Supreme Court: Thomas, the second black justice to serve on the court, lamented what he considers a society that is more 'conscious' of racial differences than it was when he grew up in segregated Georgia in the days before ¿ and during ¿ the civil rights era

The justice spent some of his childhood in Georgia when public facilities in his home state of Georgia were segregated by race, Ku Klux Klan billboards were up and didn't dare set foot in parts of Savannah.

His second wife Virginia, to whom he's been married since 1987, is white.

Yahoo News reported that he equated racial injustice with the day-to-day unfairness of life, criticizing the amount of focus placed on racial issues in national discussions.

'My sadness is that we are probably today more race and difference-conscious than I was in the 1960s when I went to school.'

Outspoken: The conservative justice who, among other things, has written opinions supporting limits on Affirmative Action, added that 'the worst things that have been done to me, the worst things that have been said about me, by northern liberal elites, not by the people of Savannah, Georgia.'

'To my knowledge, I was the first black kid in Savannah, Georgia, to go to a white school. Rarely did the issue of race come up,' Thomas said during the service hosted by the nondenominational Christian university.

'Now, name a day it doesn’t come up. Differences in race, differences in sex, somebody doesn’t look at you right, somebody says something. Everybody is sensitive. If I had been as sensitive as that in the 1960s, I’d still be in Savannah. Every person in this room has endured a slight. Every person. Somebody has said something that has hurt their feelings or did something to them — left them out.'

'That’s a part of the deal,' he added.

In his 2007 memoir, 'My Grandfather's Son,' he described his experience growing up as an African-American Catholic in Georgia during the Jim Crow era. 'I was a two-fer for the Klan,' he said.

After leaving the church for awhile he reconciled with Catholicism in the mid-1990s after become someone disenchanted with it while at Holy Cross.

Thomas moved north from Georgia for college and graduated from Yale Law School in 1974 after marrying his college sweetheart in 1971.

Straight-talking: To my knowledge, I was the first black kid in Savannah, Georgia, to go to a white school. Rarely did the issue of race come up,' Thomas said during a chapel service in Florida

He went on to a successful judicial career that took him all the way to the Supreme Court. Along the way he claims to have experienced more discrimination in the North than the South.

'The worst I have been treated was by northern liberal elites. The absolute worst I have ever been treated,' Thomas said.

'The worst things that have been done to me, the worst things that have been said about me, by northern liberal elites, not by the people of Savannah, Georgia.'

In his autobiography, Thomas recalled his rocky confirmation being worse than his childhood growing up under segregation, writing, 'my worst fears had come to pass not in Georgia, but in Washington, D.C., where I was being pursued not by bigots in white robes but by left-wing zealots draped in flowing sanctimony.'
