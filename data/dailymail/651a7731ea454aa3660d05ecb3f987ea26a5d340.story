It may sound like something out of a sci-fi film, but reading text messages off contact lens in the eyes could soon be a reality - bringing a whole new meaning to the term 'instant messaging'.

Scientists have developed a new technology that allows electronic messages sent from mobile phones to be directly projected on to contact lens placed in the recipient's eyes.

The spherical curved LCD display, created by Belgian researchers at Ghent University, handle projected images using wireless technology.

The researcher have shown off the contact lens, which contains a working LCD display. They say it could one day be used to show emails and other information - and even lead to 'Google glasses' without the glasses

The lens' capability were demonstrated by scientists who showed a dollar sign being projected on to the lens.

It is a step towards 'fully pixelated contact lens displays' with the same detail as a TV screen which could completely transform the way we communicate.

'Normally, flexible displays using liquid crystal cells are not designed to be formed into a new shape, especially not a spherical one,' said Jelle De Smet, the main researcher on the project.

'Thus, the main challenge was to create a very thin, spherically curved substrate with active layers that could withstand the extreme molding processes,‚Äù he said.

'Moreover, since we had to use very thin polymer films, their influence on the smoothness of the display had to be studied in detail.

'By using new kinds of conductive polymers and integrating them into a smooth spherical cell, we were able to fabricate a new LCD-based contact lens display.'

Not far off: The lens that can receive text messages could be ready to go on sale in just a few years

The new technology means the entire surface of the contact lens can be used to project images and messages.

Researchers are also looking at the possibility of also using the lens as sunglasses which adapt to the level of sunlight.

Jelle De Smet, the chief researcher on the project, added: 'This is not science fiction.

'This will never replace the cinema screen for films.

'But for specific applications it may be interesting to show images such as road directions or projecting text messages from our smart phones straight to our eye.'
