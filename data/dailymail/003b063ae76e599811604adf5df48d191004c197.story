Malia Obama was spotted attending music festival Lollapalooza in Chicago this weekend.

President Obama's eldest daughter, who recently celebrated her 16th birthday, was attending the gig with friends - and a few burly Secret Service members on Sunday.

The teenager attempted to blend in with the crowd in a summery daisy-print skirt and top and some grungy boots suited for the muddy field - but failed to do so.

She left after watching the last act Chance The Rapper, where R. Kelly came on stage, on Sunday night.

The teenager stayed until the finale was over and then left the park on foot with friends, according to TMZ.

Music fans took to Twitter to share their excitement over seeing the first daughter. One teenager, Sarah, tweeted a selfie with Malia with the caption: 'J chillin with Malia Obama.'

One journalist Jessica Hopper tweeted that she had seen the 16-year-old watching Lorde, writing: 'i was standing next to malia obama (plus secret service) = total utopian teen dream!'

Malia was pictured at one point in the crowd standing next to a burly man dressed in black believed to be Secret Service, TMZ reported. Lorde played her set on Friday night.

Another, JD, tweeted: 'I asked Malia Obama for a picture and she said she wasn't allowed to take pictures with people.'

Lollapalooza took place over three days at Grant Park in Chicago from July 31 with as many as 300,000 people in attendance. A regular three-day ticket costs $250. 

Headline acts included Kings Of Leon, Eminem, Outkast, Arctic Monkeys, Skrillex and Calvin Harris. 

Malia is an avid music fan - last month she went to see Beyonce and Jay-Z in Chicago with mom Michelle and younger sister Sasha, 13, while the First Lady was in town for a Democratic fundraiser.

 In an interview with People magazine in December, Michelle Obama revealed that her daughters are big fans of Beyonce's music.

'They love Jay Z. They love Beyonce. Sasha is still a One Direction fan, although I think Malia has become a little less into boy bands,' Mrs Obama said in a joint interview for People Magazine.

'They've gotten to know Beyonce, and she has always been very sweet to them,' Mr Obama added.

Already this summer, Malia has worked in Los Angeles as a production assistant on the set of 'Extant,' a new CBS sci-fi thriller starring Halle Berry and produced by Democratic Party donor Steven Spielberg. She's also learning how to drive. 

The 16-year-old has also been touring different colleges in California, including Berkeley and Stanford, as she prepares to head off to college in 2016.  

Malia goes into the 11th grade this fall at the private Sidwell Friends School in Washington.
