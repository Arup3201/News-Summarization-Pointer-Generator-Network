She has worked in farming for almost four decades - and is patron of nearly 50 organisations in the British countryside.

But tonight, Princess Anne was happy to speak out about gassing as the most humane way to cull the badger population.

The Princess Royal said she supported the controversial method - deeming it a 'much nicer way' to kill badgers than shooting.

Voicing her opinion: Princess Anne has cited gassing as a 'much nicer way' to cull badgers than shooting

In an interview with BBC's Countryfile programme, she said: 'Most of the people who did [badger culling] in the past will tell you that gas is a much nicer way of doing it, if that's not a silly expression, because of the way it works.

'And how it works is that you go to sleep, basically. I don't believe that shooting was ever a particularly good 
way of dealing with it.'

Princess Anne runs the sprawling Gatcombe Park estate in Gloucestershire, where bovine TB has wiped out a third of one of her herds in the past two years.

She said she thought badgers were a 'source' of the TB outbreak due to their increasing population - adding that the rise in numbers could cause problems for other species such as hedgehogs, bees 
and ground-nesting birds.

Appearing on the BBC One show, the Princess Royal also said genetically
 modified crops 'have a role to play' in helping feed the world, putting
 her at stark odds with her older brother Prince Charles.

The Queen's daughter admitted she seldom discusses the issue with the Prince of Wales, who once 
suggested the method risked creating ‘the biggest disaster 
environmentally of all time’.

She said new methods were needed to ensure the world's population is 
adequately fed, adding that those who are opposed to the idea have to 
accept GM crops will be cultivated.

During the 
extraordinary interview, Princess Anne also 
suggested that eating horsemeat is ‘worth looking at’ as a way of reducing the numbers of neglected or abandoned horses.

She said: 'The meat trade adds value to the animals so there is some point in 
keeping it healthy if there's an end point it can go to.'

She added that she had tried eating horse meat in past - and had found it tasted 'very good'.

Princess Anne's comments about gassing badgers came after Environment Secretary Owen Paterson 
refused to scrap the controversial pilot badger culls.

An
 independent report found that the ‘controlled shooting’ used so far has
 not been an efficient or humane way to reduce the number of badgers in 
the South West.

Her remarks have been met with fury from animal rights campaigners and zoologists, who argue that gassing - which was banned in 1982 - is inhumane.

An
 independent report published on Thursday found that the badger cull in 
Somerset and Gloucestershire had been marred by poor marksmanship.

Badgers had in some cases taken longer than five minutes to die and far too few animals were killed.

Controlled shooting - the shooting of free-running badgers - was not an efficient way of killing the animals, the report found.

Professor
 Rosie Woodroffe, senior research fellow at the Zoological Society of 
London, said: ‘Gassing badgers was government policy in the 1970s, and 
reports of the time are full of frustration about how it just wasn’t 
very effective.

‘Sub-lethal concentrations of gas were inhumane. That’s why gassing was banned by ministers in 1982.

‘The
 problem seemed to be that badger setts are built to hold warm air in 
and keep cold drafts out - so it was very difficult to achieve lethal 
concentrations of gas.’

She added: ‘Culling works against the grain of badger ecology and behaviour.

‘It’s
 much more promising to explore the possibilities for vaccination, which
 could potentially exploit the same aspects of badger biology to improve
 the effectiveness of TB control.’

Meanwhile, Mark
 Jones, of Humane Society International, said: ‘It is extremely 
disappointing that a prominent member of the royal family should endorse
 the gassing of a supposedly protected indigenous wild mammal.

‘Gassing
 experiments carried out at Porton Down in the early 1980s were 
abandoned because of the appalling levels of suffering to which the 
badgers were exposed.

‘Any
 attempt to reintroduce gassing would doubtless result in a slow and 
painful death for many badgers, and potentially other non-target 
animals.’

But tonight, the Princess Royal backed the gassing method - and claimed that she did not think her willingness to cull badgers was incompatible with her passion for wildlife.

She also advocated the use of land for smaller rural developments, built in groups of 'about ten' with proper telephone and internet access.
