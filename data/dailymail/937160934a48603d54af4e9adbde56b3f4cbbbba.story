Gobbledygook: Russell Brand, has been recognised for his public speaking and writing - with an award

Russell Brand has finally been granted the recognition he deserves.

Yesterday the comedian and self-styled revolutionary was honoured with an award – for speaking gobbledygook.

He won the annual Foot in Mouth prize from the Plain English campiagn, joining the likes of John Prescott and George W Bush.

Organisers said Brand – who has carved a career out of using many, often inflammatory, words when one would do – was ‘out on his own’ in the competition.

They added: ‘While we admire Russell’s determination to open up a debate about democracy and the dire state of the world, we struggle to make sense of most of his comments.’

The group’s website said that Brand’s ‘seemingly endless stream of gibberish, both written and verbal’ had clinched the award. Brand, 39, who was sacked by MTV for going to work dressed as Osama Bin Laden the day after 9/11, later hosted Channel 4’s Big Brother’s Big Mouth and wrote memoirs My Booky Wook and Booky Wook 2. 

He is worth around £9million and lives in Shoreditch, East London. This week he backed a protest against rising rents in the city, but got angry with a reporter who asked him what his own home cost.

He has taken to railing against the political system – despite admitting he does not vote – and has appeared on Newsnight and published a manifesto, Revolution.

The Plain English judges singled out this rant from The Guardian: ‘I felt very connected to activism – particularly activism that feels loaded with potential. Not the oppositional activism that seems like there’s a stasis around it – earnestly sincere, but a monolith.’

Confrontation: The award came two days after Brand accused Channel 4 News journalist Paraic O’Brien of being a ‘snide’ as he was interviewed while helping to deliver a petition to 10 Downing Streeet

They also enjoyed this interview, from the Financial Times: ‘I find [capitalism] hard to understand. It obfuscates truth and I think an economic ideology is oppositional to the spiritual ideologies that are what we need to adopt if we’re to save our planet and humankind.’

The Plain English campaign, set up in 1979 to promote clear language, suggested that some of Brand’s ramblings might be ‘due to him being more worried about self-promotion than about making sense.’

London Mayor Boris Johnson was named Plain English Communicator for urging clarity in politics, and Golden Bull prizes for ‘written tripe’ went to Edinburgh Council, Buckinghamshire County Council, HMRC and BT.  

On the BBC: Over the last year, Brand has taken to railing against the political system - despite admitting he does not bother to vote - with two appearances on Newsnight (one pictured above, in October)

'Sticking up for clarity in Westminster': London Mayor Boris Johnson was named Plain English Communicator for his comments on gobbledygook in politics

On Clashing Cultures: ‘This . . . indifference seems like nerdish deference contrasted with the belligerent antipathy of the indigenous farm folk, who regard the hippie-dippie interlopers, the denizens of the shimmering tit temples, as one fey step away from transvestites.’On 

On Time: ‘People don’t realise that the future is just now, but later.’ 

On Capitalism: ‘The economic arm of the individualism and materialism ideologies that keep us framed in a narrow bandwidth of consciousness prevents us from seeing that we’re all connected.’
