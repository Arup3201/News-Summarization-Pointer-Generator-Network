A white van man who dumped a huge pile of waste down a countryside lane has been fined £1,000 after police tracked him down from a McDonald's receipt found among the rubbish.

Patrick Lishman, 30, dumped the waste on secluded Washingwell
Lane in Whickham, Tyne and Wear, before driving off.

But hidden among the scraps of wood, 
plastic bags and old electrical fittings were two McDonald's receipts 
which he'd crumpled up and chucked out the window.

Fly-tipper Patrick Lishman, pictured left, has been fined £1,000 for dumping waste in a secluded area after workers from Gateshead Council tracked him down from a McDonald's receipt left among the piles of rubbish

Investigators from Gateshead Council found the receipts and, using some old-fashioned detective work, used them to track down Lishman.

The receipts, one for a chicken sandwich and fries and another for a sausage and egg mcmuffin and a bacon, egg and cheese bagel, stated the meals had been purchased from a McDonald's on Shearlegs Road in Gateshead.

Investigators then trawled through CCTV from the store until they found footage showing Lishman 
ordering the meals at the drive-through in his white Ford Transit van which was loaded up 
with waste.

They then tracked Lishman to his home in Marian Court, Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, when Police traced the vehicle registration.

The 30-year-old was this week handed a £1,000 fine after admitting fly-tipping - depositing controlled waste without a waste management licence - at Gateshead Magistrates Court. He was also ordered to pay £100 costs plus a £100 victim surcharge.

Dumped: Patrick Lishman left this mound of rubbish, including scraps of wood, plastic bags and two McDonald's receipts down a secluded lane in Whickham, Tyne and Wear

Colin Huntington, service director of waste services and grounds maintenance at Gateshead Council, said the authority goes to great lengths to catch up with fly-tippers and other environmental pests.

He said: 'The amount of waste dumped was significant. Our investigating team did a great job of tracking down the culprit.

'I hope that this sends out a clear message to anyone who thinks that they can get away with dumping waste illegally.

'Even the smallest of clues can be used to trace those responsible and the consequences can be serious.'

Lishman dumped the waste at the side of the country lane on January 16. Investigators were also able to trace evidence in the bags of rubbish back to Durham Prison.

Detective work: Investigators found the McDonald's drive-through address on the receipt and tracked down the restaurant's CCTV footage which showed Patrick Lishman buying food from the chain

After contacting the prison they discovered Lishman had been subcontracted for the removal of waste. 

This is not the first time fly-tippers have been tracked down through their own rubbish.

Fly-tipper Scott Hamilton was also caught when he left his personal details in a pile of rubbish. The 21-year-old, from Walker, Newcastle, dumped unwanted furniture in a park and left a note with his personal details among the rubbish.

Another fly-tipper Mohammed Javad also dumped refuse along with paperwork that had his details on. Officers traced the waste back to the 41-year-old's store, the Beer and Food Discount Centre on Welbeck road, in Walker, Newcastle.

Caught out: Investigators used the number plate of the white van, pictured in the CCTV footage still filled with rubbish, to trace Patrick Lishman's address
