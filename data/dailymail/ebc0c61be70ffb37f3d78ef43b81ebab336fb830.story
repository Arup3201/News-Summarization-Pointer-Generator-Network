The world's top airlines collected more than £31.5billion in extra charges in 2013, an increase of more than £4billion on the previous year.

Some airlines are making up to 40 per cent of their money from charging for extras like seat allocation, checking in luggage and food and drink on flights, according to a report by consultancy IdeaWorks Company.

And when it comes to budget flights charging for extras, there are some surprise contenders at the top of the list.

Taking off: Jet2 is one of the airlines relying on extra charges, ranked in the top five airlines for extras in the world

Despite once leading the way as the budget airline that takes the most money from so-called ancillary charges, Ryanair only appears in fifth place in the 2013 report.

1.  Spirit - 38%

2.  Wizz Air - 35%

3.  Allegiant - 33%

4.  Jet2.com - 28%

5.  Ryanair - 25%

6.  Tigerair - 24%

7.  Jetstar - 21%

8.  AirAsia X - 20%

9.  easyJet - 19%

10.  AirAsia Group - 18%

It is actually beaten by Jet2, the Leeds-based budget airline, and Wizz Air, the Hungarian carrier which operates across Europe.

The top carrier overall for extra charges was actually Spirit Airlines, which advertises itself as 'ultra low cost' and operates across the US, the Caribbean and Latin America.

Wizz Air took second place, relying on ancillary charges for 35 per cent of its revenue, while Allegiant - a US airlines based out of Las Vegas - Jet2 and Ryanair completed the top five.

Asian and Australian carriers also made it into the top 10, including Tigerair and Jetstar, with easyJet coming in ninth place, with extras equally 19 per cent of its income.

The statistics show a massive increase in extra charges by airlines.

In 2007, when the report was first launched, Ryanair led the way with anciallry charges representing 16 per cent of the money it took from customers.

Now the top airlines, Spirit, relies on extras for 38 per cent of its money, with Ryanair raking in 25% of its cash from seat charges, baggage charges, car hire commission and food and drink.

The report states: 'Spirit Airlines earns its top listing through aggressiveness. The airline is simultaneously proud of complementary objectives. It’s proud of its ability to deliver ultra-low fares for consumers, and equally proud of pushing the limit on fees.

Beyond tickets: Wizz Air relies on extra charges for 35 per cent of its income

Charm offensive: Ryanair has changed some of its costs in a bid to become more customer-friendly

'It introduced the idea of charging fees for large carry-on bags in 2010.4 That same year, the average fare charged to consumers fell to its lowest point since the carrier had changed to a low fare strategy in 2005.5 Not surprisingly, the non-ticket component (ancillary revenue) increased from $3.38 (£1.93) to $31.28 (£18.32) during the same period.'

The report also quotes Ryanair boss Michael O'Learly once saying: 'The other airlines are asking how they can put up fares. We are asking how we could get rid of them.'

Ryanair's drop in the tables comes amid a charm offensive by the airline after worries that it was angering customers too much with hidden costs.
