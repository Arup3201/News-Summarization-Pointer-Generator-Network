Democrats serving on a House committee tasked with investigating the  attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya said today that key questions about the September 11, 2012 assault had already been 'asked and answered' and the committee was at risk of 'wasting taxpayers' dollars.'

They also argued that four months after it's creation, the committee, which was allotted $3.3 million in funding for 2014, has still yet to put forth clear objectives and a timeline to complete its investigation. 

'If we do not define the scope of the committee's work in advance, this committee may end up being a committee in search of a mission, taking, on a life of it's own and costing taxpayers millions,' Rep. Adam Schiff, a senior member of the House Intelligence Committee argued.

The House Select Committee on Benghazi, whose formation was announced in early May by House Speaker John Boehner, will hold it's first public hearing tomorrow morning.

Ahead of the hearing, the committee's five Democrats released a 133-page Compendium of Investigative Resources and a Benghazi on the Record online database that lists frequently asked questions about the Benghazi attack, including, 'Where was the president and what did he do on the night of the attacks?'

Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking member on both the Benghazi committee and the House Oversight and Government Reform committee, said Tuesday that Democrats sifted through previous reports and hearings to create the database, and they hoped that their Republican colleagues would use it as a a research tool.

'In this time of austerity, we don't want to be wasting taxpayers' dollars,' Cummings said, after the government has already conducted numerous reviews of the events that occurred leading up to and during the attack. 

'We need to make full use of the extensive investigations that have come before us already,' he said.

'We need to avoid duplication, conserve taxpayer dollars, and help improve the security of US facilities and personnel around the world.'

Already, seven congressional committees have held investigations into Benghazi and they have released nine reports, the Democrats said.

'We should not be spending the time that we have on this committee reviewing questions that have already been answered in numerous investigations and reports,' Rep. Tammy Duckworth, a freshman Democrat on the committee, said today.

'If we want to make sure that no American diplomat, no American life, no american service member is ever put in the same kind of jeopardy again,' she continued, 'then we need to move beyond the questions that have already be answered.'

Tomorrow's Benghazi committee hearing will supposedly do just that. 

The topic of the hearing is whether the State Department has implemented the 29 changes in policy recommended in an Accountability Review Board report released several months after the Benghazi attack.

The ARB encouraged State to increase the number of U.S. forces at embassies in high-threat areas and rely less on local law enforcement for the protection of American personnel after it's investigation into the Benghazi assault found that 'systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies at senior levels within two bureaus of the State Department' were responsible for security that was 'inadequate' for the consulate in Benghazi.

'If we do not define the scope of the committee's work in advance, this committee may end up being a committee in search of a mission, taking, on a life of it's own and costing taxpayers millions,' Rep. Adam Schiff argued

House Republicans have criticized the Accountability Review Board in the past for failing to interview then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for its investigation, as well as two deputy secretaries of state. 

A news report released on Monday from The Daily Signal, an outlet ran by conservative think-tank The Heritage Foundation, claimed that ARB's investigation was further flawed because it did not have access to all of the documents relevant to it's inquires.

Raymond Maxwell, a former deputy assistant secretary for Near Eastern affairs, claims he stumbled upon State Department employees, including one of his subordinates, hiding information that could be damaging to Clinton or her allies. 

'She told me, "Ray, we are to go through these stacks and pull out anything that might put anybody in the [Near Eastern Affairs] front office or the seventh floor in a bad light",' Maxwell's employee allegedly told him.

Maxwell told The Daily Signal that those documents were set aside and put in basement room to be reviewed by Clinton's staff. Only the least damaging documents were provided to the ARB, he claimed.

A State Department spokesman said on Monday that Maxwell's accusations were 'totally without merit.'

Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican on the House's Benghazi committee, told The Daily Signal that the committee would investigate the charge nonetheless.

'I'm 100 percent confident the Benghazi Select Committee is going to dive deep on that issue,' he said. 

Cummings scoffed at the allegations on Tuesday, saying that when Maxwell was interviewed by Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa 'he never talked about this.'

'He had plenty of opportunities to do it, he didn't,' Cummings claimed, noting that the committee questioned him 'extensively.'

'But keep in mind we have allegations seem to come out every week,' he said, others of which have turned out to be erroneous.
