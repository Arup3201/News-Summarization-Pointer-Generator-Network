A British boy has drowned after falling into his grandparents’ swimming pool on Spain’s Costa del Sol.

Relatives tried to save the four-year-old after finding him floating in the water at the start of a family holiday in Cartama near Malaga.

The boy, named locally as Shae Colford, had flown over with his parents and a sibling on Saturday.

An autopsy was due to take place today and an investigating judge was put in charge of a probe into the tragedy.

But police said everything was pointing towards the child's death being a tragic accident.

Police and paramedics were alerted around 6pm yesterday after 
the boy's mum spotted him in the water and pulled him out.

The incident happened at a house next to the main road linking the 
villages of Coin and Cartama around a 20-minute drive inland from 
Malaga.

The dead boy, thought to be the youngest of two children, had flown to 
Spain on Saturday with his parents to visit his expat grandparents.

A spokesman for the Guardia Civil, the police force covering the area 
where the tragedy happened, said: 'The autopsy is yet to take place but 
we're treating it as a tragic accident.'

Spanish media called it Black Sunday for drowning deaths after the boy died in Cartama and two others also drowned

The Spanish media has dubbed the day as a 'Black Sunday' for drowning deaths.

Just 60 minutes later a 50-year-old man was found floating in the sea off the coast of nearby Torrox.

And earlier in the day on the eastern Costa Azahar a Romanian woman, 46, drowned off the coast of Castellon at 10.25am.
