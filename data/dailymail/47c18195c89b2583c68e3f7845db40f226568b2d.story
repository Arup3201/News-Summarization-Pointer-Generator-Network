Charles Manson, one of America's most notorious mass murderers, was denied parole today in his 12th and possibly final bid for release from a California prison.

Manson, 77, who has not attended parole hearings in recent years, was not present for the review of his case by the state board at Corcoran State Prison where he is serving a life term.

The Corrections and Rehabilitation Department said Manson would next be eligible for parole in 15 years, when he would be 92 years old.

He had been denied release 11 times before, most recently in 2007, when the board ruled that he 'continues to pose an unreasonable danger to others and may still bring harm to anyone he would come in contact with'.

There was currently no explanation for the board's latest rejection, which was announced two and a half hours after the hearing began this morning at Corcoran, about 175 miles northwest of Los Angeles.

Amid the hippie culture of the 1960s, Manson, a charismatic ex-convict, put together a collection of runaways and outcasts known as the Manson Family.

In the summer of 1969 he became one of 
the 20th century's most infamous criminals when he directed his mostly 
young, female followers to murder seven people.

Son of a serial killer: Matthew Roberts believes that he is the lovechild of Charles Manson

Questionable history: Roberts, 44, claimed he was conceived at a San Francisco, drug-fuelled orgy attended by Manson in 1967 and has said: 'It was like finding out your father is Hitler.'

Veracity: Roberts cannot be sure Manson is his father unless he sees 'somebody scrape a piece of skin off [Manson's] ass and bring it to a lab'

Among the victims was actress Sharon 
Tate, the pregnant wife of filmmaker Roman Polanski, who was stabbed 16 
times by members of the cult in the early morning hours of August 9, 
1969.

Her sister Debra Tate attended Manson's parole hearing this morning and testified before the board.

Four other people 
also were stabbed or shot to death in Tate's home that night by the 
Manson followers, who scrawled the word 'Pig' in blood on the front door
before leaving.

The following night, Manson's group stabbed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca to death, using their blood to write 'Rise,' 'Death to Pigs' and 'Helter Skelter' - a misspelled reference to the Beatles song - on the walls and refrigerator door.

Roberts first wrote to Manson in 2009 and the killer replied to Matthew's letter straightaway and has since sent him a string of ten rambling handwritten notes and postcards signed with the swastika

Manson is serving a life sentence for those seven slayings and the murder of an acquaintance, Gary Hinman, who was stabbed to death in a separate murder in July 1969.

Manson originally was sentenced to death in 1971 but was spared execution after the California Supreme Court declared the death penalty unconstitutional. In 1977, his sentence was commuted to life in prison with the possibility of parole.

California later resumed executions but Manson's life sentence was left intact.

A photograph of Manson released last 
month showed the aging, gray-bearded killer, his face still bearing the 
scar of a swastika he carved into his forehead during his sensational 
1970 murder trial.

Following
what was likely to be Manson's last parole hearing, the man who is 
convinced that the mass murderer is his father said he wanted to be sure
after previously inconclusive DNA tests.

Killed: Sharon Tate was murdered by Charles Manson and his cult followers in 1969. She was almost nine months pregnant

Matthew Roberts, 44, claimed he was conceived at a San Francisco, drug-fuelled orgy attended by Manson in 1967 and has said: 'It was like finding out your father is Hitler.'

He told CNN today that he cannot be sure Manson is his father unless he sees 'somebody scrape a piece of skin off [Manson's] ass and bring it to a lab'.

Roberts first wrote to Manson in 2009 and the killer replied to Matthew's letter straightaway and has since sent him a string of ten rambling handwritten notes and postcards signed with the swastika - a symbol the killer has tattooed on his forehead.

He also confirmed he was his father, recalling times spent with Matthew's mother.
