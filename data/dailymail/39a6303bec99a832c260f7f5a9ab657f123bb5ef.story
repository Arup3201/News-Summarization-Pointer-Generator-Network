First it was her man, now she's after her job ... it doesn't look like Made In Chelsea girl Lucy Watson will be making friends with co-star Louise Thompson anytime soon.22 year-old Lucy was spotted on a photo shoot for British fashion label Gorgeous Couture in Ibiza this weekend.

The stunning brunette from Fulham has replaced Louise, her arch rival in the reality show, as the face of the luxury fashion brand.

Sneaking away from the Channel 4 cameras for a weekend the TV star was seen posing on the rooftop of the boutique hotel Es Vive in bright body con dresses and a nude swimsuit with gladiator heels.

Lucy joined Made In Chelsea last season and immediately ruffled feathers with her 'take me as I am' attitude.

She revels in her reputation as the show's mean girl and has been seeing bad boy Spencer Matthews, Louise's ex-boyfriend, since the beginning of the second series.

She first asked for his number when he was with long term love Louise, and so news that she has now replaced her as the celebrity face of the brand is bound to smart.

The Gorgeous Couture shoot is Lucy's first fashion campaign and she had a full glam squad on hand to primp her, including two make-up artists, one hairdresser and a celebrity stylist.

She tweeted a picture of her hair and make-up to her 260,000 Twitter followers saying: 'In hair and make-up for @GorgeousCouture new collection!' before posing in up to 20 different outfits at various locations around the party island.

Viewers of the show are used to 
diva-ish behaviour from the leggy socialite, and it doesn't look like she was working too hard as she also found time to tweet envy-inducing pictures of her poolside lunch and developing tan lines.

The campaign images are due to be 
released later this summer and insiders on the shoot claim that the 
pictures will be much sexier and glossier than Louise's 2012 shoot.

Petite Louise probably isn't too 
worried though as she has just been snapped up as the face of Theo Paphitis's 
lingerie and swimwear brand Boux Avenue.

The Chelsea girl posed in the brand's summer collection aboard Theo's luxury yacht, tweeting snaps of her and new love Andy Jordan.
