At least 70 people were arrested at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris during violent protests against Francois Hollande as he commemorated France’s war dead.

The disturbing scenes are a massive humiliation to the 59-year-old Socialist president, who is by far the most unpopular head of state in his country’s recent history.

Armistice Day is a public holiday in France, and traditionally a time for solemn reflection as the country unites to remember the end of World War I, and those who have died in other conflicts.

But today the centre piece of the commemorations – the head of state laying wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier – turned into an unruly farce.

As millions watched live TV broadcasts, protestors started booing and then shouted ‘Hollande resign!’

There were also chants about Hollande being in charge of a left wing ‘dictatorship’ in which unpopular laws were being passed without consultation with ordinary people.

Fighting then broke out on the Champs Elysee as armed police tried to arrest those responsible for the disturbances.

It was then that Hollande and his fellow ministers were rushed away in a waiting limousine, accompanied by police sirens and whistles.

‘The atmosphere was extremely ugly,’ 
said one onlooker. ‘There were a lot of people showing a great deal of 
disrespect for the president. This is unheard of on Armistice Day.’

Among those protesting were so-called ‘Red Hats’, a group of activists from Brittany who are furious at the number of factories closing down, particularly in the agricultural sector.

Unemployment and the cost of living have spiralled since Hollande came to power last year, yet he is still threatening tax rises and other punitive measures.

Many French are particularly angry about a proposed ‘eco-tax’, which has been suspended following outbreaks of violence at the end of October.

Conservatives from a group angry at the Socialists’ same-sex marriage bill which was enacted this year were also out in force in Paris today.

Supporters of the far-right National Front were also demonstrating, along with those who are opposed to their anti-immigration and anti-Europe views. Many blame Hollande’s failing policies for the rise of extremism within France.

There were further ugly Armistice Day scenes in the southern town of Chateaurenard, near Avignon, when MP Bernard Reynes, of the an opposition UMP party, was stabbed three times in the back as he took part in commemorations.

Two people, including a knifeman, have been arrested. Hollande has further November 11th public duties to attend to today, and security has been stepped up around him.
