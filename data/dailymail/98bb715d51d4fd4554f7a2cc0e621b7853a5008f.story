Unthinkable tragedy: Among the dead was Dianne Chickaway, 37, whose husband, Dale, survived the horrific crash that, in all, killed six people

The heartbroken mother and father of the five Native Americans - all under 10 years old - killed in a Mississippi car accident Saturday will bury their brood during a single, tragic funeral this week.

Misty Dreifuss, a Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians spokeswoman - all six dead belong to the tribe - said the children's funeral will be held Wednesday at a tribal building in Choctaw.

A wake for the siblings was planned for Monday, she said.

'It has hit the community very hard,' Dreifuss told the AP of the 10,000-member tribe, one of three federally-recognized groups of Choctaw Indians in the U.S.

A funeral for Dianne Chickaway, a 37-year-old friend of the children's family, meanwhile, is scheduled for Thursday at Hopewell Baptist Church in Leake County, according to Dreifuss.

The crash's cause remains under investigation, and no charges have been filed. A Mississippi Highway Patrol crash reconstruction team was reportedly going to visit the scene Sunday.

Neshoba County Sheriff Tommy Waddell said the victims apparently drowned after their Dodge Durango swerved off County Rd. 107 shortly after midnight Saturday, plunged down an embankment and into a fast-moving, rain-swollen creek, located 20 miles southeast of the Mississippi city of Philadelphia.

Duane John, the siblings' father who was driving the Dodge Durango, remained hospitalized for hypothermia and water inhalation. Mother, Deanna Jim, and 
Chickaway's husband, Dale Chickaway, also survived.

Authorities said they performed 
alcohol testing on Duane John, but that results would not be 
publicly revealed until at least Wednesday, the same day as the children's funeral. Despite the recent rainfall 
and the winter storms sweeping the country, officials said they are confident inclement conditions did not cause the wreck.

'This accident is not weather-related at all,' Waddell told The AP.

'It looked like he has just run off 
the road and went into the water,' Deputy County Coroner Marshall Prince
added to the AP. 'It was deep and swift. The vehicle was completely 
submerged.'

Authorities 
identified the deceased children as Daisyanna John, 9; Duane John, 8; 
Bobby John, 7; Quinton John, 4; and Kekambas John, 18 months 
old. In all, the doomed Durango counted nine occupants, none of whom were apparently wearing seat belts or child 
restraints at the time of the accident, officials said.

Four of the five children attended Pearl River Elementary School, Dreifuss told The AP.

'It's always sad to hear of the death 
of a tribal member,' Tribal Chief Phyliss J. Anderson wrote in a 
statement obtained by the AP. 'But today our tribe experienced ...the loss of six beautiful
Choctaw souls.

'I cannot begin to imagine what the 
friends, relatives and loved ones are feeling. There are no words that 
can express our sincere condolences to such a horrific accident.

'I join 
many of you in the outpouring display of love and support shown to the 
families during this difficult time,' Anderson added. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with 
them.'
