Sunderland stars scrubbed up to take part in their annual fashion show in support of the club's charity Foundation of Light on Monday evening.

First team players including John O'Shea, Lee Cattermole and Adam Johnson sported designer threads as they strutted their stuff down the catwalk at the event held at the Stadium of Light.

This year's theme was vintage carnival, with clothes supplied by intuMetroCentre, and a range of live entertainment to entertain the guests including manager Gus Poyet.

Now in its sixth year, the show managed to raise £40,000 last term and the players will be hoping they can beat that total  to help up to 42,000 people through the charity.

The players were joined on stage by just some of the young people who have taken part in education, sport, health and community programmes run by the Foundation of Light.

Midfielder Jordi Gomez was taking part in the event for the first time, he told the Sunderland Echo: 'This was my first time on the catwalk, it's been OK. All I could do was my best. It's a great thing for everyone, I have been looking forward to it.' 

Ken Teears, development director at the Foundation of Light, said: 'Out of all the events we run, the fashion show is the pinnacle of the winter calender and one of our biggest fundraisers annually.

'The children get a real buzz out of going down the catwalk with their heroes, and it is a once in a lifetime opportunity, for them.'
