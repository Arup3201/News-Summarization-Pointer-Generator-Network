Soldiers are set to get a Google Glass-like augmented reality system designed for the battlefield.

Called ARC4, it allows commanders to send maps and other information directly to the soldier's field of vison.

The gadget attaches to a military helmet, and can even be integrated with weapons control system.

Called ARC4, the new system allows commanders to send maps and other information directly to the soldier's field of vison.

The system can overlay key information such as the location of enemies, satellite footage and mission objectives

Rather than looking down at a 2D map or chest-worn computer, the soldier sees virtual icons (such as navigation waypoints, friendly/blue forces, and aircraft) overlaid on their real-world view.

The software will run on a specially adapted display that clips onto helmets, or on a range of existing AR goggles.

It can track exactly where a user is looking and adjust the display accordingly.

The firm behind it, Applied Research Associates, says the system was developed as part of a six year project with substantial investment from the US Military's DARPA unit.

'We worked closely with warﬁghters throughout the design, analysis, and ﬁeld testing phases of the program,' the firm said.

Rather than looking down at a 2D map or chest-worn computer, the soldier sees virtual icons (such as navigation waypoints, friendly/blue forces, and aircraft) overlaid on their real-world view.

'You are able to perform your mission with high awareness of their surroundings, with enhanced safety, speed, and in close coordination with team members,' ARA claims.

'This state-of-the-art technology provides heads-up situational awareness for the military – allowing soldiers to perform their jobs with enhanced safety, speed, and mission effectiveness,' the firm said.

However, it could also be used in logistics and even by the public.

How it works: The system is connected to control units on the soldier's body. Information is sent wirelessly to the soldier and displayed over one of their eyes.

As well as military uses, the new system could be used for:

Consumer Products: Real-world object tagging and sharing for socially networked users

Team Coordination: Shared awareness for emergency management and response

Logistics and operations: Tracking assets, personnel, and tasks for worksites and events

Immersive Training and gaming: Virtual avatars and effects embedded with live operations

The software will run on a specially adapted display that clips onto helmets, or on a range of existing AR goggles.

It can track exactly where a user is looking and adjust the display accordingly.

The gadget's lead engineer, Dave Roberts, said it is 'a flat-out game changer that’s ideal for anyone who wants to visualize, create, and share heads-up information.

'ARC4 will change the way you see and interact with the world around you – the same way the smart phone changed the way you communicate.'

The firm experimented with dozens of prototypes for the system before deciding on the final model (left)

The ARC4 software renders AR information on any wearable see-through display – including night vision devices, making it easy to integrate with existing product.

The firm also says its system is more advanced that Google's Glass.

'ARC 4 does more than present conventional communications and directional information (e.g., messages, tweets, maps, pictures) in a heads-up fashion.

'ARC4 is transforming your view of the world with digital tags that persist as if painted on physical objects. Imagine it as virtual grafﬁti.'
