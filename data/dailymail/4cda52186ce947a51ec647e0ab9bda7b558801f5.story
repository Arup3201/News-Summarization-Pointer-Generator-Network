A man is fighting for his life in hospital after plunging from a hotel penthouse onto iron railings 60ft below.

The 19-year-old barman at the hotel is said to have suffered 'horrendous injuries' after he fell from a roof terrace at Glasgow's Blythswood Square hotel early this morning.

He was discovered bleeding and badly injured on the pavement below, near a foot long spike that had apparently broken off a row of metal railings on West George Street, Glasgow.

Two metal railings appeared to be broken after the man was discovered with 'horrendous' injuries early today

Broken off: A section of metal railings outside the Glasgow hotel was clearly missing a black iron spike

The man was attending a private party on the rooftop terrace of the five star hotel's penthouse suite, which costs Â£1,500 per night, when the incident happened.

Inspector Kenny Darroch, of Police Scotland, said: 'There was a small group who appeared to have been at a party in the penthouse and the man has fallen.

'He is now at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. He's alive but he has horrendous injuries.'

A colleague who wished to remain anonymous said: 'I have been told that it was a barman working at the hotel.

'I think the party was hosted by a former head barman at the hotel who was coming back to spend all his money.

'It is an absolutely horrible thing to happen.'

Police officers cordoned off Blythswood Square and stopped traffic for several hours while officers took photographs and statements at the scene.

A spokesman for the Scottish Ambulance Service said: 'We got a call at 4.55am about a 35-year-old male lying in the street.

'There is suggestion that he's fallen off the roof. We've taken him to Glasgow Royal Infirmary.'

Cordoned off scene: The man, who police say is in a 'serious condition' in hospital, has not yet been named

Hotel: The man had been at a party at the five star hotel and spa in an historic building in the city centre

A police officer at the scene, who asked not to be named, said: 'There is no investigation - we're not looking for anyone - but there's obviously protocol to follow.'

Described as 'magnificent' on the Blythswood Square hotel website, the penthouse suite has a rooftop terrace, private bar and dining room with views over the city which 'will quite literally take your breath away'.

Guests are treated to a bottle of Dom Perignon 2003 Epernay Champagne, on arrival and can enjoy a well-stocked complimentary mini bar.

This morning, the hotel's managing director Hans Rissmann declined to comment on the incident.

A spokeswoman for Police Scotland confirmed the man was in a 'serious' condition and said: 'Around 5am a report was received of a man having fallen from the roof of a building in the centre of Glasgow.

'We're still trying to piece together the circumstances.'
