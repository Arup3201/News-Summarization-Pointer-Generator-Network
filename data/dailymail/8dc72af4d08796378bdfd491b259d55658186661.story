A healthy and active five-year-old who has his own vegetable patch has been branded overweight by a government initiative.

Oliver Knight completed a medical as part of the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) to assess his body mass index (BMI).

Measuring 1.085m (3ft 6in), and weighing 20.6kg (3 stone, 3lb), Oliver's BMI is in the 91st percentile, putting him in the 'overweight' category.

This percentile means he weighs more than 91 out of 100 of his peers.

Green fingers: Oliver has a love of healthy food and even tends to his own vegetable patch in his back garden

Still growing: Oliver eats healthy meals every day, with a typical dinner consisting of potatoes and salad

Energetic: Oliver's puzzled mother Sharon describes her child as 'absolutely full of energy'

His
mother Sharon, 40, was shocked to receive the letter from Oldham 
Council, claiming her son is energetic and loves vegetables, but says 
she won't tell Oliver about the result because of the way it could 
affect him.

Mrs Knight said: 'Oliver is such a skinny little thing. I couldn't believe what I was reading.

'Firstly, I can't believe they're doing this to five-year-olds. They're still growing, and they need three meals a day.

Oliver Knight has been classed as overweight as his BMI percentile is 91

'But Oliver eats healthily all the time - we have our own vegetable patch and he loves salad.

'The other mums at school get wound up because their children won't eat as many vegetables as he does.

'And we don't buy sweets or sugary treats, because I have an autistic son and if he eats them it doesn't do him any good.

'He needs to eat healthily, so I just don't have them in the house.'

Mrs
Knight says a typical meal in the family household would be chicken, 
with salad and potatoes, and that Oliver has Weetabix for breakfast plus
the healthy lunch the school provides.

She added: 'He exercises all the time, 
because we have family days out where we go walking or cycling. He's 
absolutely full of energy.'

Back in February, Oliver took part in a school project on healthy eating.

His mother says that when he got 
home, he didn't want to eat his tea or breakfast the following day 
because he was so scared of getting fat, and she's scared that if he 
sees the letter, the same thing will happen again.

Sharon 
said: 'There is just no way Oliver is overweight. It's concerning to 
think that they are saying this to people who are so young.

'They wonder why so many young people have eating disorders, and then they do this. It's really annoyed me.

'As
a family, we just eat healthy meals and get out and about. I've been 
told not to take it to heart, but you can't say that to a child.

'According to the Royal College of 
Paediatrics and Child Health UK 2-18 years growth chart, a child with a 
BMI above the 91st is classed as overweight, while a child above the 
98th centile is clinically obese.

Shocked: Sharron Knight brandishes the letter from Oldham Council which branded Oliver 'overweight'

Banned: The Knight's house is free from sugary sweets and drinks. Instead Oliver enjoys healthy fruit and veg

A Public Health England spokesman said: 'The NCMP is recognised as being fundamental to efforts to tackle childhood obesity in England. It records the height and weight of children in two age groups at state maintained schools every year. The results inform local authorities about levels of obesity in their populations.

'Parents also receive these results because they have said, through focus groups, it's important and they want to be aware of potential issues with their child's health.

'Evidence shows parents and health professionals do not always recognise overweight in children, which is why an objective measure rather than visual assessment is important.'

Mum's the word: Mrs Knight has vowed to keep the letter secret from her son. She claims other mother's get 'wound up' because their children refuse to eat their fruit and vegetables
