Hotel staff refused to serve a man with Down's Syndrome fish fingers - because the dish was on the children's menu.

Willie Forbes, 47, who visited the Royal Highland Hotel in Inverness for dinner while on holiday with his family, was told the meal - his favourite - was only available to under-12s, his niece claims.

Mr Forbes' niece Clare 
Cummings, 19, said staff at the Scottish hotel had discriminated against
her uncle because of his disability, and thousands of people aired their disgust at the incident on a 
Facebook page calling for a boycott of the venue.

Anger: The hotel in Inverness has come under fire for refusing to serve Mr Forbes the dish he ordered

The page - on which the hotel was branded 'disgusting', 'shocking' and 'disgraceful' for refusing to serve Mr Forbes the meal he wanted - appears to have been taken down.

The firm's regional manager Indranil Banerjee issued an apology via the hotel's own Facebook page for the upset caused to Mr Forbes and his family, but insisted staff had not discriminated against him because of his disability.

The hotel in Station Square is investigating the incident.

Mr Forbes lives in supported accommodation in Aberdeen, but was in Inverness for the day following a weekend at Lochloy Holiday Park in Nairn with Miss Cumming and her mother Linda.

Miss Cumming said the trio went into the restaurant at the Royal Highland Hotel for a meal, but were told Mr Forbes could not have the fish fingers from the children's menu because it was only for those aged under 12.

'I tried to explain he had Down’s Syndrome and had special dietary requirements,' she said.

'He
can’t eat big portions, only little portions. The waitress went and got
a supervisor but he was like, "No, you can’t have that". We just got up
and left.'

Miss Cumming said they ate next door at the Filling Station restaurant, where staff 'couldn't have been nicer'.

'We got the kids' menu and everything,' she said.

Miss Cumming said she was convinced Royal Highland staff discriminated against her uncle because of his disability.

'They made us feel like we weren't part of the clientele. It is just unacceptable,' she said.

The shocked teenager described her family's experience on her Facebook page, and someone unknown to the family later set up a page calling on people to boycott the hotel in response.

Mr Banerjee has urged Miss Cumming to contact the hotel as he said no direct complaint has been made.

'I would like to reassure all of our guests that we pride ourselves in providing equal opportunities to our diners.

'I truly regret the distress that Willie and his family have experienced,' he said.

He said the family was offered a 
choice of meals from the adult section of the menu - which included fish
goujons that would have been provided in a smaller serving.

This was denied by Miss Cumming, who said she wanted Mr Banerjee to travel to Aberdeen and apologise to her uncle in person.

A separate Facebook page was set up in support of the Royal Highland Hotel in the wake of the incident.
