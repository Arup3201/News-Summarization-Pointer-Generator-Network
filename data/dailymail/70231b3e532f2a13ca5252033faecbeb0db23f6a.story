Snatched from the Regents Park townhouse of the Marks and Spencer’s heiress in a daring heist, it was lost for more than four decades.

The £25 million Gauguin masterpiece hung on the wall of a former Fiat factory worker for 40 years before he realised its true value and reported it to the police.

Now the Sicilian shift worker who unearthed Fruit on a Table or Small Dog, by Paul Gauguin, has been allowed to keep the painting, and it has returned to pride of place on his kitchen wall.

A court ruled a pensioner, 70, could keep the £25million Gauguin masterpiece, which he paid the equivalent of £19 for 1970

The anonymous pensioner bought the painting for 45,000 lire, or £19, along with a Bonnard, also stolen from the London home of Mathilda Marks in 1970.

The paintings then travelled across Europe by train before coming up for sale at the railway lost property auction in Turin in 1975.

Many years later the man's art student son noticed the painting's similarity to Gauguin's other works and made enquiries with art police.

Now, after no one claimed the paintings, a court in Rome has ruled that he could keep both the £25million Gauguin and Woman with Two Chairs, by Pierre Bonnard, thought to be worth £500,000.

The pensioner, now 70, whose name is protected by Italian law, said he would finally be able to take his wife on a honeymoon they had never been able to afford ‘from Trieste to Vienna’. 

He also wants to buy a farm in his native Sicily- and splash out on some more paintings.

He told La Repubblica he didn’t expect to keep the works. ‘But now I feel like a citizen who has done his duty.'

He remembered: 'When I brought them home from the auction I thought "I don't care who painted them. They are beautiful."

'Don't ask me why I liked them. It was intuition.'

The paintings were found in April this year, 44 years after three conmen managed to convince a London housekeeper that they were carrying out security checks.

One posed as a policeman, while his two accomplices pretended to be fitting a new burglar alarm.

They took the paintings from their frames while the housekeeper was making them a cup of tea.

Investigators found the painting still hanging in the kitchen and began a painstaking search to discover its real owners.

After trawling through back catalogues of exhibitions they read about the disappearance of the 1889 Gauguin and traced the paintings to Mathilda Marks and her husband, author Terence Kennedy.

Both have now died, leaving no children. The Metropolitan police say there have not been able to trace the owners nor have their been any claims on the painting in the UK.
