A man has pleaded guilty to the horrific killing of his young grandson.

Raymond Matthew Brittle, of Thurmont, Maryland, abused the two-year-old over an extended period of time, but ultimately killed the toddler one night when he refused to eat his dinner, beating him with a belt, kicking his body and even lifting the child up by his head.

The boy died three days later at Children's National Medical Center in Washington D.C. on September 8, 2013.

Raymond, 40, has been indicted on seven charges, including second-degree murder, first-degree child abuse resulting in death, second-degree child abuse, conspiracy and assault.

He pleaded guilty to all charges and faces up to 55 years in prison. 

His wife Melissa, 37, who was home when the incident occurred, pleaded guilty earlier this month to first-degree child abuse resulting in death.

The Frederick News-Post reports that it was Melissa who got Raymond to confess to the child's cause of death, after she agreed to be wired and record a telephone conversation between her and her estranged husband, who she filed for divorce from earlier this year. 

'Why did you do it to him?' she asked him, according to charging documents.

'Missy, you were right there when I did everything. You said he needed his ass beat,' Raymond responded.

The couple initially said the boy had fallen down a flight of stairs and off a trampoline.

This was also not the first time the young child had suffered gruesome treatment from his monster grandparents, with the medical examiner noting the boy was covered in bruises, had a largely fractured skull and his brain had shifted.

The injuries to Robert's head were akin to those of a child who had fallen from a several-story building said the medical examiner. 

Even more upsetting may be the cuts found in the boys mouth, reportedly the result of Raymond brushing the boy's teeth with a wire barbecue brush.

Doctors at Children's National Medical Center called it one of the worst cases of child abuse they had ever seen. 

The couple had been caring for the child for months after Melissa's daughter left the boy with them.
