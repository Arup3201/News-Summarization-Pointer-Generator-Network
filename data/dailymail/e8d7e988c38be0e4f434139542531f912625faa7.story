The failure to teach youngsters a trade has led to the end of the artisan class and forced companies to fill jobs with foreign workers, business experts  have said.

Nick Hewer and Margaret Mountford – who appeared alongside Lord Sugar on The Apprentice – claim young British adults have a sense of entitlement and are lacking in work ethic, hampering their chances of finding employment.

Speaking ahead of a documentary on migrant workers that will be broadcast next week, Miss Mountford, 62, said: ‘There’s nothing unlawful about employing people at £11 an hour rather than £15 if you can get them.

‘But is it wrong to be British and to have a sense of entitlement? We have decided as a nation that 50 per cent should go to university and look down on trade qualifications, and it’s better to go and get a media studies degree that doesn’t get you a job than to go and learn a trade – whereas in Germany, it’s as hard to get into technical colleges as it is to get into the good universities.’

Mr Hewer, who now presents Channel 4’s Countdown, claimed the demise of the artisan class had left Britain ‘teeming with bodgers’.

He said: ‘I think the artisan who exists in Europe doesn’t exist in this country.

‘Now anybody who loses their job buys a Mitsubishi Warrior with lots of chrome and is suddenly a plumber.

‘The truth of the matter is that the country is teeming with bodgers because nobody gets trained.

‘The old apprenticeships have gone and people think, “I think I’ll do a bit of plastering and bricklaying”. So nobody is actually trained.

Lack of incentive: Mr Hewer said that the old apprenticeships have gone - leaving bricklayers and builders without proper training

‘The artisan class in Europe still exists. I don’t think that in Germany, Spain or France they have programmes called Rogue Traders and Rogue Builders where you call in plumbers and builders and they just rip you off.

‘It’s a bit of a British tragedy, and I don’t think it exists in other countries where trade is a good thing.’

The comments come days after the Government’s Migration Advisory Committee warned that too many school-leavers lack even the basic abilities to ‘look people in the eye and get out of bed’.

The immigration panel claimed British students are given little incentive to work by the benefits system.

As a result, businesses have had to turn to workers from overseas who are better qualified, more reliable, confident and – unlike their native competitors – have the good manners needed to deal with customers.

Mr Hewer said Polish migrants ‘have the guts, the energy, the initiative and are prepared to slog it out in another country in a different language ... inevitably, they are going to be more driven’.

He added: ‘The fact that they slammed their front door in Vilnius and hacked their way across Europe to a foreign country shows that these are people with initiative, drive and ambition.’

He will appear in the BBC show Nick and Margaret: Too Many Immigrants?, which pairs UK-born citizens with five London-based immigrants from all over the world to explore their impact  on Britain.
