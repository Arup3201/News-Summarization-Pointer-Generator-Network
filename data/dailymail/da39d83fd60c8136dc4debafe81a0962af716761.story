Manchester United central defensive target Mats Hummels has revealed that he may remain at Borussia Dortmund - even if the club fail to qualify for the Champions League.

Dortmund have endured a terrible season to date and languish second bottom of the Bundesliga having collected just 15 points from 17 games.

Qualification for Europe's premier competition looks extremely unlikely - they are 12 points behind fourth place - and rumours had suggested Hummels would leave if Dortmund did not reach the Champions League.

But the 26-year-old German international has intimated that is not necessarily the case.

Speaking to Die Welt, Hummels said: 'We have worked to the maximum in every game but a few times but opponents were better than us.

'We have to get up and move up the ranks as soon as possible.

'Would I play in Dortmund without the Champions League? I do not think qualification for the Champions League will be the only requirement to be happy.'
