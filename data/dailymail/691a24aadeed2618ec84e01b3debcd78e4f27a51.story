Meeting up to discuss the end of a relationship has officially been replaced by e-mails and texts as research discovers young people are increasingly choosing to dump partners electronically.

An online relationships study from Pew Research Center found both sexes are guilty of breaking up with someone online, but women marginally beat men by one per cent.

In total, one in six Americans have dumped someone, or had someone dump them, by text message, email, or through social networks.

College-educated singles aged between 20 and 40 are the most prolific users of online dating, according to research from Princeton Survey Research Associates.

One in 10 internet users now turning to dating websites - up from just three per cent of American adults in 2008.

Similarly, seven per cent of smartphone users say that they have used a dating app on their phones.

And compared with eight years ago, online daters in 2013 are more likely to actually go out on dates with the people they meet on these sites.

Sixty six per cent of online daters have gone on a date with someone they met through an online dating site or app, up from 43 per cent of online daters in 2005.

The figures come from the study carried out by Aaron Smith and Maeve Duggan at the Pew Internet Project.

They surveyed 2,252 Americans about online dating sites, using websites and search engines during relationships and how technology impacts modern-day relationships.

According to the findings, the most prevalent electronic heartbreakers are aged between 18- and 29-years-old at 22 per cent.

However, 16 per cent of 30- to 49-year-olds admitted to resorting to text or email to end a relationship along with seven per cent of over 50s.

The trend has been linked to the rising popularity of online dating sites, which has more than tripled in the past five years.

As more people meet and forge relationships online, the researchers believe they are then more likely to end relationships in the same way.

Women were found to be most likely to dump someone electronically, according to an online relationships study by Pew Research Centre in Washington. The most prevalent electronic heartbreakers are aged between 18 and 29 years old and the trend has been blamed on the rise in online dating sites

It's not all doom and gloom, though. Around a fifth of people who meet online go on to fall in love and get married.

Smith and Duggan's study also found 30 per cent of people who use 
online dating sites search for information about their dates before 
meeting them, and this figure jumps to 41 per cent among users aged 18 
to 29 years old.

Elsewhere, almost half of young users admitted to using search engines and social network sites to snoop on their exes.

In total, 11 per cent of American 
adults have used a dating site or dating app and men and women are 
equally likely - 54 per cent - to complain when a person's profile is 
misleading.

More than 
40 per cent of women who use online dating sites claim to have been 
victim to 'unwanted approaches' compared to just 17 per cent of men. 

The
figures are similar on social network sites, too, with a third of women
and 19 per cent of men admitting to have blocked someone for flirting 
or acting in a way that makes them feel uncomfortable.
