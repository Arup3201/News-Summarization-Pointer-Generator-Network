In court: Former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi

Former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi today told a court that photographs taken of him surrounded by women were an  attempt to make his home look 'like a harem'.

The pictures published in the glossy Italian magazine Oggi showed the 75-year-old walking hand in hand with the women who 
were described as 'Berlusconi's Angels'.

They showed some sitting on his lap and in one snapshot he is pictured with his 
eyes closed and his hand inside a woman's T-shirt.

The images were printed over eleven pages which ran them under the headline: 'Berlusconi's Harem.'

Unusually for Berlusconi - who is 
currently involved in four trials - he appeared in court as a victim as 
he brought the civil case against the former editor.

It was later revealed all the women 
were aspiring TV starlets with one being identified 
as Angela Sozio, 39, a former Big Brother contestant.

The media tycoon turned politician 
told the court in Milan: 'Holding hands with my guests is something I do
all the time. It's normal for me to do that, to make my guests feel at 
ease.'

He added of the photographs, which were published in 2007 by Oggi's then editor Pino Belleri:  'The way they were presented as 'Berlusconi's harem' was totally different to reality.'

The pictures were taken by Antonello Zappadu at Villa Certosa, Berlusconi's luxury home near Porto Rotondo on the island of Sardinia, a well known millionaire's playground where he has entertained several high profile international political guests over the years.

Among them were Tony Blair and his wife Cherie who famously spent the weekend with Berlusconi in the summer of 2004, just hours after he had undergone a hair transplant and he was snapped alongside the couple wearing a bandanna.

They were treated to a spectacular fireworks display which ended with the words 'Viva Tony' lighting up the night sky - and neighbours complaining about the noise from the eruption that was produced from a specially built fake volcano.

Berlusconi added: 'The way the pictures were taken, they deliberately excluded images of male guests because the photographer was looking for a sale.

'To take the pictures that he did he would have to have come onto the property - it would not have been possible any other way.

'My staff found that branches and flowers in the area where the photographer was had been broken and trampled of.

'The grounds and garden of villa Certosa are wonderful - I have the largest hibiscus in the world and there is also a working pizzeria, ice cream parlour and fairground. People who are my guests leave very reluctantly.'

Prosecutor Alberto Nobili told the court the 15 photographs which had been published were 'taken illegally' and as such Mr Belleri was also guilty of wrongly receiving them.

Berlusconi then told the lawyer defending Mr Belleri that he had no problem returning to give evidence as he was so regularly in the Milan court building 'I have an office' - a reference to his four ongoing trials including one for sex with an underage prostitute.

Judge Maria Teresa Guadagnino adjourned the trial until next year and afterwards Berlusconi was clapped and cheered as he went shopping in a nearby street.
