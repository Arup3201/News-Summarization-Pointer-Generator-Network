One of the most peculiar sights of this World Cup came last week in Recife.

As the roads of the north-east coastal city ran two feet deep in water after overnight rain, journalists on a media bus battling through the torrents to reach the Arena Pernambuco took photographs and shot video of the chaos.

It was only after a few moments that it became clear that some of the townsfolk – clinging to lamp posts and traffic islands to keep dry – were taking photos right back.

Spectacle: The atmosphere at the stadia in Brazil has been impressive

To many – probably most – Brazilians, this World Cup is a curiosity, something that has simply been going on around them. There are not many local black faces in the stadia on match day.

World Cup 2014 has out priced vast swathes of its host nation but we shouldn't be surprised and it is not alone. This is the way in modern sport.  Go on to a council estate in London and ask people how many of them have tickets for the next Six Nations and you will get my point.

It was the same in South Africa in 2010 and will be the same in Russia in 2018. The World Cup has long since been an event for tourists and televisions.

If you own a hotel or restaurant in Brazil then you will have won over the last three weeks. If you live in one of the scruffy narrow streets that branch off the new four lane highway that runs up to the Estadio Castelao  in Fortaleza then forget it. This World Cup – like all the others – has been nothing more than a procession passing by your window.

Eye-catching: There has been 154 goals scored at the World Cup so far

As a model for social equality, then, this World Cup has achieved little. As a sporting event, however, it has passed its test comfortably and – thanks to the beauty of the football – spectacularly.

This, remember, was supposed to be the World Cup that wouldn't work. It was to be the tournament where stadia weren't ready, where the infrastructure wouldn't cope and where visiting football fans would lose their wallets and mobile 'phones.

They said all this before South Africa, of course, and, just as it didn't happen then, it hasn't happened here.

There is a firmly held belief here in Brazil that things are better when left to the last minute. It's reflected in the haphazard nature of the service industry. If you want your bar meal by full-time, then you are really better off ordering it before kick-off.

Certainly, that has been reflected in the way that the stadia, airports and hotels dragged themselves in to shape just in time. Those who visited Brazil in April returned with horror stories of unfinished airport terminals, half-completed roads and stadia without roofs on. 

But while it hasn't been perfect, it has certainly worked.

Success: Sepp Blatter has been kept in the background by events on the pitch

While you wouldn't wish to get to the airport in Natal in a hurry – the shiny new road from the terminal gives way to cobbles and potholes after about a mile – or reach the stadium in Recife in time for a pre-match sandwich, these have been the exceptions.

The airports here would certainly shame Heathrow in Manchester and while some hotels haven't been places in which you wish to linger for post-dinner drink it must be remembered that Brazil remains, in essence, an extremely poor country.

Those who have followed their teams across this vast landscape will have returned home exhausted, penniless and with more air miles than Richard Branson. Brazil doesn't do trains.

That, however, is FIFA's issue and, happily, it is one they seem set to address in time for Russia 2018 where we will return to the old system of basing each group in one city. That way, supporters won't get to see as much of Russia but will also mean a World Cup holiday won't require a second mortgage.

FIFA, of course, will make a fortune out of this tournament.  Ticket prices are far too high and some FIFA-recommended hotels profit from the uncertainty of the knockout stages by charging last-minute visitors rates to make the eyes water.

More than £800 for two nights at the Fortaleza Holiday Inn, anyone? 

It is indicative, though, of a successful tournament that FIFA president Sepp Blatter has hardly been mentioned since this one started. When the football is good, and the World Cup ticks along without undue drama, all the rest just becomes a sideshow.

My World Cup so far totals twelve matches, 16 flights and – most importantly – 36 goals. That's a spectacular return in keeping with the overall figure of 154 goals so far. The atmosphere in the stadia has far outstripped that of South Africa, thanks largely to vastly increased numbers of visiting fans from competing nations.

And the really good news? There are still eight games to go.
