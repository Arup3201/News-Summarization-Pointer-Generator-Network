It's back: The Daily Mail Schools Trophy returns

An eagerly awaited North-South showdown launches the second Daily Mail Schools Trophy when Whitgift host Sedbergh on Saturday.

The clash is a first trip for the Cumbrian rugby establishment - whose old boys include Will Carling and Will Greenwood - to Whitgift, the Croydon-based school who helped nurture Danny Cipriani and Marland Yarde.

Last season, Woodhouse Grove, the Bradford-based school, inched out Sedbergh to win the Trophy and were rewarded by a visit from Sir Clive Woodward.

‘We’ve travelled up twice to Cumbria and lost twice,’ said Whitgift’s head coach Chris Wilkins.

‘But the one time they were due to come to us there was an outbreak of mumps at Sedbergh and the fixture was called off.’

Sedbergh lost only once last season and so, understandably, Wilkins is keen to face them on home turf.

‘It’s a great game to start the season. We expect another good contest,’ Wilkins said.

Sedbergh and Whitgift are among the pack out to stop Woodhouse Grove, who went 12 games unbeaten last season.

Woodhouse Grove - Adrian Sweeney: ‘We’ve lost 11 of our squad so we need to rebuild. But we still expect to be competitive. We have some good players coming through and some very promising teams further down.’

Sedbergh - Simon Mulholland: ‘We went on tour to South Africa in the summer and it provided exactly the sort of rugby we wanted. We played some excellent rugby in helping to put a new team together.’

Hampton - Zoran Higgins: ‘We’ve had five or six good seasons now so we’ve set the standards high. We expect to do well and hope to be very competitive, but there some good teams around and you always expect tough games.’

Whitgift - Chris Wilkins: ‘We have a hard working group which has been bolstered by some very good players from our Under 16 squad. We have a tough fixture list so let’s see how we get on.’

Dulwich - Sam Howard: ‘It’s looking like a transition season for us and we are not as big. But we are hoping our backline will play some very exciting rugby. Consistency will be the key.’

Brighton College - Nick Buoy: ‘We are looking to have a strong squad. A lot of the players from the lower sixth gained good experience last season and are ready to step up.'

To cap that success Woodhouse completed a national double by capturing the schools’ 20-20 cricket title.

This year, however, they will field a new-look team with 10 or 11 new faces due to pupils moving on.

Grove should know if they have a title-challenging squad by the end of September, as their opening games are against two of Yorkshire’s strongest schools - St Peter’s York and QEGS Wakefield.

Elsewhere, RGS Wycombe host Wellington and Millfield on successive Saturdays, while Solihull, who came fifth last year, face trips to rivals Old Swinford and King’s School, Worcester.

It all amounts to an action-packed start to a terrific autumn of rugby.
