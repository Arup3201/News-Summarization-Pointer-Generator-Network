Luckily, Harry Redknapp already has enough happy White Hart Lane memories to last him a lifetime.

Because on Sunday, returning to Tottenham, his Queens Park Rangers team were destroyed in a wholly one-sided encounter.

It was a day of intriguing sub-plots, Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino’s first home game, Leroy Fer and Mauricio Isla making their QPR debuts, while former coach Les Ferdinand also made his return to White Hart Lane after his summer departure following Tim Sherwood’s sacking — as guest of QPR chairman Tony Fernandes.

But the most interesting storyline was Redknapp’s return. There was no fairytale ending though, only misery, as he watched his team — and their new 3-5-2 formation — blown away.

Redknapp was afforded a warm welcome by Spurs supporters on his first return to the ground since his controversial sacking in 2012.However, the QPR fans were not pleased midway through the second half when their manager answered calls from home fans to give them a wave, triggering boos from the already frustrated travelling contingent.

‘A disappointing day, very disappointing,’ admitted Redknapp. ‘We started poorly and didn’t get out of it. We looked a little bit like a team of strangers.

‘It doesn’t hurt more because it’s Spurs, it’s three points. That’s all that matters to me. Getting beat here is no different to getting beat anywhere else.’

Redknapp will have left knowing that under Pochettino, this current Spurs team have the potential to recreate the free-flowing winning football that became a feature of his four-year Tottenham reign.

Following Sherwood’s dismissal, chairman Daniel Levy entrusted Pochettino with the task of bringing flair back to White Hart Lane.

And, Tottenham showed tangible evidence the Argentine is heading in the right direction.

‘At the moment we want to put in place our philosophy and try always to convince we can play in the way Tottenham played in their history,’ said Pochettino. ‘But it’s important to keep the reality and stay calm because if you lose two games, you are in danger.

‘It’s always better when you win. It’s easier to develop your style and philosophy when you win. We are top of the table but it’s nothing because it’s two games in.’

Tottenham's 48-pass move that led to Nacer Chadli’s second goal was twice as long as any Premier League goal scored in 2013-14.

HOW EVERYONE HAD AT LEAST ONE TOUCH

Etienne Capoue 14

Jan Vertonghen 10

Nabil Bentaleb 6

Younes Kaboul 4

Erik Lamela 3

Danny Rose 3

Nacer Chadli 2 

Eric Dier 2

Emmanuel Adebayor 2

Christian Eriksen 1

Hugo Lloris 1

For QPR, the signs were ominous from the outset, Tottenham dominating possession; Pochettino’s high-pressing style already having a clear influence.

It took 12 minutes for Spurs to open the scoring, Nacer Chadli coolly finishing at the back post after Richard Dunne failed to deal with Emmanuel Adebayor’s cross from the left.

Matt Phillips missed an undeserved chance to equalise for the visitors on 20 minutes, firing over with just Hugo Lloris to beat.

Redknapp knew it was the sort of chance his side could not afford to squander, and he was right as Spurs set about putting themselves three goals clear before half-time.

Christian Eriksen rattled the bar with a superbly executed 30-yard free-kick in the 24th minute before Spurs’ latest hero Eric Dier added to his growing reputation by scoring Tottenham’s second, nodding home Erik Lamela’s 30th-minute near-post corner after slack marking from Fer.

Seven minutes later, Lamela showed why Tottenham have been so keen to persevere with him despite a disappointing first season. He cut through QPR’s shell-shocked defence before producing an inch-perfect cross to leave Chadli with the simple job of heading past Rob Green. 

After a difficult first season at Spurs, the Argentine showed signs of major progress. Two first-half assists provided tangible evidence of that, but it was his body language and demeanour that was perhaps most impressive.

Lamela wanted the ball at every turn, not afraid to express himself — a far cry from last season’s injury troubles. But how Chadli was afforded the freedom of the penalty area to score his second will have infuriated Redknapp.

Much has been made of QPR’s switch to a 3-5-2 system, but no formation or tactics could account for the woeful individual defending that cost QPR three goals.

Television cameras at White Hart Lane cut to Spurs legend Glenn Hoddle, now a QPR coach, sitting in the stands, furiously writing notes before the half-time break.

Dunne carried the can for QPR’s defensive woes, the Irishman substituted by Nedum Onuoha at half-time. But the second half was only ever going to be a damage-limitation exercise for Rangers.

Spurs added one more, Adebayor scoring a deserved goal after excellent work from Chadli and Danny Rose. For Pochettino the future looks bright after three wins. Next week, though, Liverpool will provide a clearer view of the progress made under the Argentine.

For Redknapp, far from looking to the future, his return to White Hart Lane may cause him to look back in anger at this humilating defeat.
