Row: Bess Price Australian politician has sparked a race row after saying prison is good for Aboriginies

An Australian politician has sparked a race row after saying prison is good for Aboriginies as 'it means they get to spend time with their families.'

Bess Price, an MP for the sitting Country 
Liberal Party made the comments after the Legislative Assembly agreed to changes in mandatory sentencing 
for violent offenders.

Price, an Aboriginal Australian activist,Â  was responding to the
 Labor Party's opposition to the law changes, which they said would see 
prison numbers increase significantly.

The member for Stuart argued that jail had 
benefits for young Aborigines.

'While they are being imprisoned, 
they don't get to drink, they don't get into trouble, they are fed three
 times a day,' she said.

'They are in there with their family members.

'They sleep in their language groups and they all come out of prison much healthier.'

Labor's Member for Nhulunbuy, Lynne 
Walker, said Price's comments were a 'sad indictment it is, of where our
 system is,' reported TNT magazine.

'When the Member for Stuart says that our families want our 
young people locked up, because prisons; they're safe places, it's where
 people can dry out for three months, it's a safe environment and where,
 sadly, a lot of family members are in there, so they're not alone.'

Controversial: Price said that jail had benefits for young Aborigines. 'While they are being imprisoned, they don't get to drink, they don't get into trouble'

She told Parliament she was saddened by Ms Price's statement and said it painted a disturbing scenario.

The North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency (NAAJA) says the comments by Ms Price reflect a sad state of affairs according to ABC.

Several people took to Twitter to voice their annoyance at her comments.

@NATSILS who describe themselves as 'the peak body for Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Legal Services' wrote on their Twitter page 'Bess Price how wrong you are. Symptoms of the real issue. Poverty.'

One user wrote 'What a tragic, simplistic and scary view' while another accused her of creating 'an apartheid.'
