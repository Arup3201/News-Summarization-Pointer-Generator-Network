Like an eye-watering optical illusion, thousands of wader birds are seen at the RSPB’s Snettisham reserve.

As far as the eye can see, the huge flock creates amazing ripples and patterns as the birds huddle closely together.

Known as the 'Snettisham Spectacular', the breathtaking sight was caught on camera by wildlife photographer Tom Mason.

Patterns: The spectacular sight can only be seen a handful of times throughout the year

The Snettisham reserve lies on the edge of The Wash, Norfolk, and is one of the most important bird estuaries in the UK.

A few times a year a higher than normal tide force thousands of waders - including knot, oystercatchers, sanderlings and more - to advance up the mud flats in search of food.

The RSPB says the best time to see this natural phenomenon is between August and January.

Waders can also be seen on the high tides from mid-July to late May.

Snettisham Spectacular as it only happens when the tides, flocks and 
winds are right

Tom said: “I visited Snettisham to see
the autumn high tide spectacular, during which over 20,000 waders flock
over the reserve - settling on land before heading back to sea as the 
tide recedes.

'The 
event only happens on occasions when the tide, flocks and winds are all 
right so I was very lucky to witness this amazing event.'
