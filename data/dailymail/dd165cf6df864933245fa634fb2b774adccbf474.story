A prisoner sent a frightening letter to a woman saying she had to give him £50 - or he would get someone to rape her grandchildren.

Joseph Harry Brown pretended to be another Durham Prison inmate when he wrote the letter to avoid checks on his outgoing mail.

Victoria Lamballe, prosecuting, told Durham Crown Court how Brown said he knew people who were leaving prison all the time who would 'enjoy raping the woman's grandchildren'.

A grandmother received a terrifying letter from Joseph Harry Brown, posing as another prisoner, which threatened to rape her grandchildren unless she sent him £50. (Posed by model)

This letter was one of many unpleasant threats made by 41-year-old Brown, who is serving an indeterminate sentence for public protection (IPP).

He had committed a series of offences since being refused parole - just some of the 113 offences on Brown's criminal record, which include arson assault and robbery.

Brown once took another prisoner hostage by tying him up, assaulting him and setting fire to his cell.

He set fire to another cell after being transferred to Preston Prison.Brown, of no fixed abode, admitted the charges of false imprisonment, making threats to kill, assault by beating, blackmail and two charges of arson.

These charges took place between January and March this year.Brown did not attempt to defend the charges against him.

Milena Bennett, defending, said: 'Unusually, my client instructs me he does not wish me to put forward on his behalf any matters in relation to the offences.

HMP Preston: Brown will be detained indefinitely and will serve at least seven-and-a-half years. He will not be released until he is considered to no longer pose a danger to the general public

'He accepts he committed these offences and knows he faces a lengthy sentence.'

Judge Michael Cartlidge handed Brown another IPP and said the prisoner would not be considered for parole until he has served another seven-and-a-half years in jail.

He said: 'It seems you think your life is hopeless after your parole was refused.

'That is a tragedy in itself.

'It also seems you are determined to spend the rest of your life in prison.

'You remain a danger to the public, and were I passing a determinate sentence it would have been 15 years.'
