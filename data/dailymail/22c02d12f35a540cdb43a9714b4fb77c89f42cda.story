The MailOnline exclusively revealed earlier this week that Justin Bieber's rumoured new girlfriend is British teen singer Ella-Paige Roberts Clarke.

And now it's been revealed the Bay hitmaker has been pulling out all the stops to woo the pretty brunette during his current trip to the UK.

Bieber reportedly impressed the 17-year-old by taking her on a date in a Rolls Royce... just a night after taking her to Justin Timberlake's BRIT Awards after-show concert.

So that's the appeal: Justin Bieber reportedly wooed 17-year-old British singer Ella-Paige Roberts-Clarke by taking her on a date in a Rolls Royce earlier this week

According to the Sunday Mirror, the 18-year-old Canadian star reportedly sent a Rolls Royce round to her home to pick her up and escort her to the flashy five-star Lanesborough Hotel in London where he was staying as he readied kicking off his UK tour.

Just hours after his wild tour of London clubs, including kindly giving two young women a lift home on Tuesday, Bieber was spotted taking Ella to Timberlake's BRIT Awards after-show concert.

The following day the MailOnline revealed her identity as the 17-year-old ambitious singer from Norfolk who friends said was 'determined to become famous'.

A source told MailOnline: 'Since she was at school she always wanted to be famous. The weird thing is she has worked so hard but just being seen with Justin Bieber is probably going to make her career.'

Another added the pretty brunette dropped out of sixth form and has been travelling after being funded by her photographer mother.

On her Twitter page Ella-Paige describes herself as a singer/songwriter/model and was obviously recognised by friends at he concert with Bieber as she tweeted today: 'Might turn off my phone for the day I am stressed.'

A source, who knows Ella-Paige from Norfolk, said the 17-year-old had moved to London and spent time in LA modelling.

It is unclear how the teenager met Justin, who split from long-term love Selena Gomez on December 30 but rumours the pair may have mutual friends have surfaced.

A source, who went to community college in London with the model, told MailOnline Ella-Paige may have met the star through her mother who is reportedly seasoned photographer with contacts in the record industry.

Canadian Justin, 18, wore his trademark 
sunglasses, cap and unusual trainers as he headed in actor/singer 
Justin's after-show concert with his head down.

Sources said the pair were certainly arriving together, although they were at pains not be photographed side-by-side.Â 

Ella-Paige looked like she had made much more of an effort for the evening in her all-black outfit and chic leather jacket.

Justin, who is in the UK for the British leg of his tour, shunned the BRIT Awards and simply went to his old pal's concert on Wednesday evening.

Jessica and Justin both went to the 
BRITs and even managed to fit in the Sony and Belvedere after-party at 
The Arts Club after performing at The Forum in Kentish Town for the gig.

Obviously
Baby singer Justin has got used to telling the time as on Wednesday he 
was spotted with just one watch - rather than the two he had on the 
night before.

Newly single Kelly Brook, 33, also rubbed shoulders with celebrities at the concert, where Justin impressed fans.

Bieber has been taking in the sights of London, spotted going to The Roadhouse in Covent Garden, alongside the Black Eyed Peas' will.i.am before heading to Harrods the day after.

Justin split from long-term love 
Selena Gomez late last year after reportedly clashing over the singer's 
flirtations with a number of Victoria's Secret models at their annual 
catwalk show in November.

But even Justin's mother, Pattie Mallette, has urged the former teen sweethearts to reconcile.

Speaking to Savannah Guthrie on The Today Show, she recently said: 'You know, I just try and support whatever he's wanting.

'I
think Selena is a sweetheart, and whatever they decide is great. It's 
tough letting go and letting our kids make the mistakes they need to 
make.'

Pattie has been 
urging Justin, 18, to reconcile with the 20-year-old Spring Breakers 
actress because she feels Selena is a good influence on him.
