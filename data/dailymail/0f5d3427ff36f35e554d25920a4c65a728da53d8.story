A police force has produced a bizarre jargon-filled ‘mission statement’ – that doesn’t even mention crime.

It is so filled with gobbledegook that it has been branded ‘absolute rubbish’ and short-listed for an award highlighting nonsense in official paperwork.

The internal document from Warwickshire Police says it aims to ‘protect people from harm’ with a range of ‘outcome focused’ functions that ‘are  professionally competent and understand the operational  policing context of their  services, ensuring that they are quality assured, effective and efficient’.

Solving something: The 1,200 word document from Warwickshire Police does not mention the word crime once

The Enabling Services Directorate, a four-page management mission statement for HR, IT and communications, speaks of police chiefs vowing to be ‘accountable through performance measurement’. In 1,200 words, the word crime does not appear.

The document is a contender for the Golden Bull award, run by the Plain English Campaign.

Spokesman Chrissie Maher said: ‘It’s absolute rubbish as far as I am concerned. It’s a screen to hide behind. It just makes me think "what are they up to?"’

‘How can I make informed decisions if they do not talk to me in plain English? Gobbledegook gives me no choice. Most of us do not use words like that.

‘I’m not asking for ‘the cat sat on the mat’ but all familiar words seem to have been sieved out and all you are left with is a horrible mess. I can’t understand any of it.'

Bureaucratic tape: The four page internal memo has been nominated for an award highlighting paperwork nonsense

‘After 50 years it’s the worst I have ever seen it.They seem to want to cloud negative messages in jargon.

‘It’s a screen to hide behind. It just makes me think ‘what are they up to? What are they trying to cover up?’’

A Warwickshire Police spokesman said: ‘We always welcome feedback on our communications.

‘This document was prepared for an internal audience.

‘The role of the new directorate was discussed in team meetings and this summary document was used as a basis for that discussion.

‘No one said they did not understand the directorate’s role in protecting people from harm after these meetings.’

Ironically, the force has even drawn up its own jargon-busting list of do’s and don’ts for officers.

The list advises officers not to refer to the colour black in case it offends someone.

The report states: ‘Don’t use phrases that include Black in a negative context, such as ‘Black mark’ ‘Black day’.

Officers are also told not to use the words Afro-Caribbean but say someone is either Black African-Caribbean or of ‘dual parentage.’

Bobbies are also warned against using colloquialisms or ‘terms of endearment that may cause offence such as 'my love' or 'my dear’.

Elsewhere West Midlands Fire Service wants to save paper, or as they put it: ‘Reduce the consumption of raw materials in line with the organisation’s value for money and environmental strategies.’
