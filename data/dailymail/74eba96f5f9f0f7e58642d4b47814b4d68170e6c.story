While Apple was unveiling its Watch yesterday, some of the biggest names in technology were showing off their own wearable devices in London.

The likes of Samsung and Intel are at the annual Wearable Technology Show (WTS) alongside smaller firms and startups. 

Devices on show include Samsung's virtual reality headset, a Bluetooth medical splint and a bag that warns owners if they've left something at home.

WTS is the industry's largest event, with more than 100 companies displaying their products, and it is taking place at the ExCel exhibition centre in London. 

Among those at the show is European 10,000m champion Jo Pavey, 41, who is testing the latest in smart training devices.

In particular she has been trying out Intel's £130 SMS Biosport earphones that work with a smartphone app to measure running pace and heartbeat. 

The latter normally means wearing a bulky and uncomfortable device on a chest strap, she said. 

Elsewhere Samsung has been showing off its Gear VR headset and Gear S smartwatch.

The watch has been discussed a lot over the past 24 hours since its main rival Apple launched its own first wearable. 

The Gear S has a 2-inch curved screen and can be used to show messages and notifications from a connected phone at a glance.

There is also a port for a nano SIM that gives the watch its own mobile network, and the screen can be customised - as well as the colour of the straps. 

Samsung's Gear VR uses the 5.7-inch Quad HD display of a Galaxy Note 4 mounted into the specially designed headset to enter virtual worlds. The Korean firm also recently unveiled it Gear VR Innovator Edition. Both are powered by Oculus Rift technology but the Innovator is 15 per cent smaller than the Gear VR

Meanwhile the Samsung Gear VR uses the 5.7-inch Quad HD display of a Galaxy Note 4 mounted into the specially designed headset to let people enter virtual worlds. It also includes basic head tracking capabilities.

The Korean firm also recently unveiled its next-generation version of the headset called the Gear VR Innovator Edition. 

Both are powered by Oculus Rift technology but the Innovator is 15 per cent smaller than the Gear VR.

Another product on show is a prototype handbag fitted with sensors that can warn a user if an item they usually carry with them has been left at home

Optimised to work with the latest S6 and S6 Edge handsets, the Innovator has reduced pixilation to make images appear more realistic and a wider field-of-view.

Samsung has also redesigned the Innovator model to give a better weight balance making it more comfortable to wear.

Some of the smaller names showcasing their devices at WTS include Burg, Osteoid and Sunfriend. 

Dutch firm Burg make a range of smartwatches for children and seniors, created by lifestyle designer Hermen van den Burg.

Its latest $129 Burg 31 is fitted with GPS and offers one-touch emergency calls and speed dialing of up to three pre-set numbers without the use of a connected phone.

The watch makes and receives calls using a SIM card, but it can also be paired with Android phones, iPhones and other smartphones to place calls via Bluetooth.

The water-resistant device additionally lasts for two days on standby. 

The Osteoid splint, designed by Turkey-based Deniz Karasahin, perfectly fits to a patient's arm using 3D scans. 

This data is transferred to modelling software, which determines the overall size and geometry of the finished cast. Once printed, a locking mechanism and algorithmically generated ventilation holes are added. 

The Osteoid splint (pictured) perfectly fits to a patient's arm using 3D scans. A low intensity pulsed ultrasound (Lipus) bone stimulator is then placed directly on a patient's skin. The company said that spending just 20 minutes a day in the cast reduces healing time by up to 38%

Sunfriend's UVA=B wristband is said to negate the need for suncream by monitoring the wearer's exposure to UV rays. Wearers begin by entering their skin tone and skin sensitivity, on a scale of 1 to 11. Sensors monitor UV levels and LEDs light up gradually. Once the safe limit has been reached, these LEDs begin flashing

According to Mr Karasahin, a low intensity pulsed ultrasound (Lipus) bone stimulator is then placed directly on a patient's skin when the design has been printed.

The medical cast is combined with the Lipus stimulator system to speed up healing.

The company said that spending just 20 minutes a day hooked to the system, which plugs directly into the cast, reduces healing time by up to 38% and increases the healing rate up to 80% over traditional casts.

Sunfriend's UVA=B wristband is said to negate the need for suncream by monitoring the wearer's exposure to UV rays.

Wearers begin by entering their skin tone and estimated skin sensitivity, on a scale of 1 to 11.

Sensors inside the waterproof wristband then monitor UV levels and LEDs light up as UV exposure accumulates. 

Once the safe limit has been reached, these LEDs begin flashing.

It is hoped the watch will help people overcome the problems of vitamin D deficiency.

A pair of the £99 SunnyCam HD video recording glasses (pictured) is also being showcased. As well as having a camera built into the frame, each pair has a Micro SD card to record footage on to. The glasses are capable of recording 1280 x 720 or taking regular photos

It does this by recognising variations in weight.
