The deputy editor of The Guardian has been made editor of BBC2’s beleaguered current affairs programme Newsnight.

Ian Katz, who is also the left-wing newspaper’s head of news, will replace Peter Rippon – who was forced out after a report into the abuse of young girls by Jimmy Savile was dropped.

The controversy also brought down former BBC director general George Entwistle and was followed by further strife when the show ran a report wrongly linking former Tory Party treasurer Lord McAlpine to claims of historic child abuse in North Wales.

The corporation’s new director general, Lord Hall, has taken a close interest in the selection of the new editor, such is the importance in mending the show’s image.

The programme had erupted into internal war over the handling of the dropped Savile investigation, which was being led by journalists Liz McKean and Meirion Jones.

The Pollard Review into the dropped investigation into Savile had been highly critical of the relationships between people on the show.

For the last few months the programme has been edited by Karen O’Connor.

Mr Katz joined the Guardian in 1990 having worked as a features editor and foreign correspondent and editor of the Saturday edition of the paper.
