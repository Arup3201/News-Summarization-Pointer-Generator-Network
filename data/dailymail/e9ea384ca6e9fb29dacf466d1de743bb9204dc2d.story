Charged: Marckenson Chery is facing a minimum of ten-years in prison for allegedly participating in Skype sex sessions with a 15-year-old girl

A 28-year-old Fort Lauderdale man appeared in court on Monday facing up to 10-years in prison after a 15-year-old girl's father discovered alleged cyber-sex sessions between the pair.

Marckenson Chery, who turns 29 this week, is accused of several online sex sessions with the San Francisco teenager during which he convinced the alleged victim to masturbate, show herself naked and then watch while he masturbated.

The teen told Chery, whose Skype name is 'Swag likeus Robinson', that she was 15 and investigators claim that she reminded him this several times during the two months they were online.

Federal agents from Homeland Security say that the California teen met Chery online in September using the anonymous online chatting site called Omegle.

They then moved their relationship to video messaging service Skype and when the girl's father became suspicious in November he took her phone and discovered 143 pages of sexually explicit chat between the two.

He handed this over to San Francisco police who then contacted Homeland Security Investigations agents in South Florida.

Appearing in federal court in Fort Lauderdale on Monday, Chery pleaded not guilty to one charge of enticement of a minor.

His attorney, Joshua Fisher, said he did not want to comment on the allegations until he has properly reviewed the evidence.

If convicted, Chery faces between 10-years to life in prison and a $250,000 fine.

Joe Trias the deputy special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in South Florida said that criminals use many different apps to make sexual contact with children and teens.

'We are seeing an increase in these kinds of cases, though I'd be hesitant to call it a trend,' Trias said in a phone interview with the Sun Sentinel on Monday.

'There's such a huge variety of apps â€¦ the criminal element is always going to find ways to use them for their own purposes.'

He warned parents to be vigilant with the social their children are using.

'The way one of our agents puts it is: 'Do you want a 30-year-old man in your child's bedroom at 1 a.m.?' Trias said.
