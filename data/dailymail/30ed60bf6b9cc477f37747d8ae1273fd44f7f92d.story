The parents of a US journalist who was kidnapped in Syria more than two years ago claim communication from White House officials about their son has been 'exquisitely horrible' and the Barack Obama has never spoken to them. 

Despite a pledge by the President to work with families of hostages and do anything to try and find them, Marc and Debra Tice claim he has never spoken to them about the disappearance of their son Austin and the only certain thing they have is that they have no idea where he is.

Austin Tice was last heard from in August 2012 near Damascus as he took photos to report on the conflict for a number of news organisations.

Mr and Mrs Tice said communication from the White House has been very limited since their son's disappearance. 

'That line of communication has primarily been one way,' Mrs Tice told NBCNews.

She said officials were keen for them to share any information they receive, but said communication back from them 'has been exquisitely horrible, honestly.'

The couple have struggled with the normal approach to keep a low media profile that officials believe can captives safer, and have instead done publicity campaigns in the hope that the American Government may take more action.

The former Marine was in the region reporting for McClatchy News, the Washington Post, CBS and others when he was taken. So far, no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping and no demands have been made.

Earlier this week Mr Obama said the Government would do all it could to help find people who had been taken hostage after kidnapping victim Kayla Mueller was confirmed dead. The 26-year-old aid worker from Austin was kidnapped in Syria in August 2013 by ISIS.

Marc and Debra Tice said communication from the US Government has been poor and 'exquisitely horrible' 

The extremists said she had died during a Jordanian air strike on Friday.

Mr Obama said: 'It's as tough as anything that I do -- having conversations with parents who understandably want, by any means necessary, for their children to be safe.

'We will do everything we can short of providing an incentive for future Americans to be caught.'

Footage of a man who appeared to be Austin surfaced in September 2012. 

In a crudely shot video, a group of armed men lead a blindfolded American up a rocky hillside, where he makes statements in broken Arabic before becoming too distressed to carry on.

Barack Obama said this week that the Government would do everything possible to try and find hostages

The identity of the man hasn't been confirmed, but friends of Austin believe it is him. 

At the time Mr and Mrs Tice said: 'Austin is the oldest of our seven children. The Tice kids are very close, and Austin's absence is agonizing.

'We steadfastly work and pray for Austin's safe return. We are sustained by our faith and by the kind thoughts and prayers that are being offered for Austin and our family. We are humbled, amazed and deeply grateful for the tremendous outpouring of support and assistance we have received from every corner of the globe; affirmation of all the lives that have been touched by our extraordinary son.'
