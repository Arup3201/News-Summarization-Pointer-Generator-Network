Workers in France are flocking to Marks & Spencer to enjoy classic British dishes - with chicken tikka masala now the biggest-selling ready meal in Paris.

The nation, which is fiercely proud of its culinary heritage, appears to be ditching more traditional French food in favour of treats such as Stilton, crumpets and curry which are sold across the British company's French stores. 

At the flagship store in Beaugrenelle - which features the largest food hall outside of the UK and Ireland - chicken tikka masala flies off the shelves, according to the company's head of international food.

And Jill Bruce told the Guardian is has now become the top-selling ready meal in its store across the entire capital.

The Champs Elysees store also sells more chicken tikka masala than any branch in the UK and also prides itself on shifting the fifth highest number of BLT sandwiches.

The surge in popularity of British food means Marks & Spencer, which saw sales in Europe up 3.9 per cent this year, now has ten food-selling stores in Paris.

Five of these are standalone stores, including the one at Beaugrenelle, which features the largest food hall outside of the UK and Ireland.

And a new franchise partnership with French company Relay France will also see ten more food stores open around Paris. In total, there is expected to be another 20 stories in the capital alone over the next three years.

The planned expansion would make Paris M&S’s largest food market outside of the UK. 

Steve Rowe, M&S Executive Director of Food, said: 'M&S Food is in much demand globally.

Pret A Manger is also experiencing a popularity surge in the French capital, along with several other British brands

'From toasted crumpets in The Hague to red wine in China, our international customers are very quick to tell us what their favourite M&S products are.

'This is why expanding our fresh food offer presents us with a strong growth opportunity.' 

And it's not the only British firm benefiting from the nation's changing tastebuds, with Pret A Manger having just opened its 11th store in Paris.

Luscombe Drinks, based in Devon, has also reported that its sale to France have tripled  in the past two years, while Tyrrells expects to hit €12m, up from about €10m, as its vegetable crisps win over the French.
