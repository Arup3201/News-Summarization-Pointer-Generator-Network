The pink argyle and white diamond ring, worth at least $577,000, was stolen from Theodore Bruce Auctions on Saturday 

About 100 people were walking through the auction centre during the time it was stolen, police revealed.

However each of the diamonds in the ring has been laser inscribed with a serial number.

More than 90 per cent of the world's Argyle diamonds are sourced from The Argyle Diamond Mine in West Australia's Kimberly desert.

The diamonds are so incredibly rare that the Argle Pink Diamonds website writes: 'an entire year’s worth of Argyle pink diamonds over half a carat would fit in the palm of your hand. The rarest of the rare, blue and violet, would barely fill a teaspoon'.
