A woman who was depressed, had poor skin and was lacking in self-esteem due to her size has shed the pounds and turned her life around.

Shelly Bannister lost 14in from her waist, 7in off her hips and slimmed down from 16st 5lbs to just over 13st by following a gruelling diet and fitness regime for seven weeks.

Car worker Shelly, 25, had reached rock bottom in May when she registered for a gastric band operation.

Before and after: Shelly Bannister, pictured on arrival at boot camp, left, and at the end of her seven-week stint, right, lost 14in off her waist, 7in off her hips and slimmed down from 16st 5lbs to just over 13st by following a gruelling diet and fitness regime for seven weeks

At the last minute she changed her mind, quit her job and enrolled at No.1 Boot Camp in Norfolk. The seven-week stay wasn't cheap at £4,699 but she says the camp's healthy food and military-style training run by ex-Special Forces experts turned her life around. 

Shelly said: 'I was just eating poorly - lots of convenience foods. At 5ft 2in, I don't carry extra weight well. 

'After steadily gaining weight through my teenage years and trying every diet there is to do and failing, I decided something had to change. 

'I had become depressed and anxious and felt unwell all the time. I just didn't enjoy anything anymore and needed to get my health and weight under control.  

'I booked an appointment to get a gastric band and that's when I thought to myself, "What am I doing?".

'I had become that desperate that I was willing to put myself through an operation - this wasn't right.'

Slimming down: Shelly considered a gastric band operation but at the last minute she changed her mind, quit her job and enrolled at a gruelling military-style bootcamp to turn her life around

Bold move: She took the drastic step of quitting her job and signing up to boot camp for seven long weeks and says it has completely changed her life

Knock-on effect: Shelly, who has a history of skin problems, says her face has never been clearer since embarking on her new lifestyle 

Shelly knew she had to break out the vicious cycle that she found herself in - and the only option was a complete lifestyle reboot. 

She took the drastic step of quitting her job and signing up to boot camp for seven long weeks. 

Shelly, who lives with her boyfriend in Wythall, near Birmingham, explained: 'I quit my job not knowing how soon I would be able to get another one or if I even had enough money to pay my bills, but I finally decided my health needed to be more important than anything else.

'The first week was hell. I ached in places I didn't know possible and I thought, "What have I done?".' 

Tough times: Shelly knew she had to break out the vicious cycle that she found herself in - and the only option was a complete lifestyle reboot and while it wasn't easy, it has certainly paid off

Challenge: Shelly said that her first week at bootcamp was 'hell' and that she ached in places she didn't even know possible

She continued: 'All these fears soon disappeared, though, when I stepped on the scales at my first weigh in and I had lost 11lbs and 5in off my waist. I couldn't believe it and couldn't wait to carry on.

'Over the seven weeks I could feel myself getting fitter. My skin was clear for the first time in years and I was sleeping much better. I have been taught so much about nutrition that I feel confident I can go home and continue my journey and know what to eat and where I have been going wrong previously. 

'I've regained my health, happiness and confidence, which is worth more than anything and I have even got my job back. 

'The most shocking moment was seeing my before and after pictures. I couldn't believe the difference. I did not think I would achieve this much in such a short period of time. I will never go back to the unhealthy, overweight person I was before.'

Gruelling: The bootcamp is run in a military style by ex-army officers and is a firm favourite of Made In Chelsea stars Spencer Matthews and Binky Felstead 

Worth it in the end: As the days passed, her fears soon disappeared and when she stepped on the scales at her first weigh in and had lost 11lbs and 5in off her waist, she was motivated to carry on
