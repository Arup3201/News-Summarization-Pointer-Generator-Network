A teenage girl dug herself out of shallow grave after she was raped by two men and buried alive.

The 13-year-old was snatched while walking to Koran lessons from her local village in Punjab and raped by the men in an isolated area.

Her attackers then buried her alive when they thought that she had died during the assault.

Horrific: A 13-year-old girl was buried alive and left for dead after being snatched while on her way to Koran class in the Toba Tek Singh region of Pakistan

But she regained consciousness and managed to dig her way out of the muddy grave and flag down a passerby.

She was taken to a medical centre and survived her horrific ordeal.

According to the New York Post, her father Siddique Mughal told local police that his daughter had been taken.

But they initially refused to investigate the incident.

But they were ordered to arrest the girl's alleged attackers by the Lahore High Court Chief Justice's Complaint Cell.

A judge from the Toba Tek Sing area, where the attack took place, has also been asked to investigate the matter.

Child rape is becoming increasingly problematic in Pakistan.

According to Pakistani children's charity Sahil, the number of children raped between 2002 and 2012 increased from 668 to 2,788.

One of the most notable cases was that of Kainat Soomro who was attacked by four men when she was aged just 13 in 2007.

She was shunned by her village after speaking out against her attackers and was labelled a 'kari' or 'black virgin'.

Despite her own family being ordered to kill her to rid themselves of shame, they stood by her despite threats of violence against them.

Her father and one of her brothers were beaten, and another older brother went missing and was later found murdered.

Despite her quest for justice, her alleged attackers were eventually acquitted.

She told the Press earlier this year that her family have 'lost everything'.
