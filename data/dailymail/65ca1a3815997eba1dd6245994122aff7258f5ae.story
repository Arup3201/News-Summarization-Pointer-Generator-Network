David Cameron attempted to smooth relations with Nicolas Sarkozy yesterday by effusively backing his campaign to retain the French presidency.

At a kiss-and-make-up summit in Paris, the pair swapped compliments after weeks of strained relations following Mr Cameron’s decision to veto the European treaty on dealing with the financial crisis.

At the time, Mr Sarkozy castigated him for the move and publicly snubbed his handshake at a summit. But yesterday it was all smiles as he claimed he might have used the veto himself had he been British prime minister needing to defend the City.

The pair met on the anniversary of the war in Libya in an attempt to rekindle the close alliance they forged during that conflict by stepping up support for rebels now seeking to oust Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad.

They agreed the world was not doing enough to help rebels in Syria, and revealed the two countries were working together on ways to give assistance to the opposition.

Beside Mr Sarkozy at a press conference in the Elysee Palace, Mr Cameron said: ‘I don’t think that there has been closer French-British co-operation at any time since the Second World War, not just in Libya but also on the vital issues of Syria, Iran, Somalia and defence co-operation.’

President Sarkozy is trailing his socialist rival Francois Hollande by a wide margin in the polls. It means the PM’s vocal backing could be risky – alienating the likely winner.

‘This summit has given me the chance to 
wish my friend well in the battle he has ahead,’ said the Prime 
Minister. ‘I admire Nicolas Sarkozy’s leadership and courage and I think
 he’s achieved great things with his country.’

The Prime Minister paid warm tribute to his host’s role in the diplomatic and military effort to defend the Libyan people against the Gaddafi regime, saying he was ‘absolutely convinced that, were it not for his leadership, we would not have now in Libya people who are free to choose their own future’.

And he added: ‘I believe it is a relationship that is easily strong enough to survive the odd bump or bounce that we sometimes have when we have a disagreement. That is what politicians do and it is what friends do as well.’

The president returned the compliments, praising Mr Cameron as ‘a brave man’, and insisting there were ‘more convergences than divergences’ between the two. He said he wanted to ensure that euro members take account of the UK’s concerns over the impact of greater financial co-ordination on the EU’s single market, while Britain would show more understanding for the eurozone’s need to act swiftly to resolve its problems.

‘I have always been of the view that Europe needs Britain, and, together with David Cameron, we are putting together working methods whereby we are going to understand one another’s red lines and come up with a greater degree of convergence,’ said Mr Sarkozy.

‘We have had divergences of views but perhaps had I been in David Cameron’s position I would have defended Britain’s interests in exactly the same manner he has.

‘What I can tell you is that there has never been a personal opposition between us. A head of state is there precisely to defend the interests of his nation, to lead others to understand how vital those interests are.’

The Prime Minister and President Sarkozy unveiled a £500million deal to step up nuclear co-operation.

The two countries will work together to build nuclear plants, creating 1,500 British jobs, says Downing Street.

Rolls-Royce and the French firms EDF and Areva will sign contracts to begin building the first in a new generation of power stations at Hinkley Point in Somerset.

The deal will see ministers and businesses in the UK and France work closely together on research and development and with the International Atomic Energy Authority to improve global ability to fight nuclear disasters like Fukushima in Japan.

Civil nuclear energy agreement worth more than £500million for parts and construction work on new nuclear power plant in Hinkley Point, Somerset, and training facility in Bridgwater.

Proposal for new pilotless military drone capable of more precision strikes will advance to procurement stage and will involve Britain's BAE.

Plans for joint command and control centre for future military operations will be accelerated.

Two leaders will also discuss options for offering support to rebels within Syria - although military intervention not a suggestion.

Mr Cameron said: ‘Today’s summit shows the strength and depth of Britain’s ties with France.

‘As two great civil nuclear nations, we will combine our expertise to strengthen industrial partnership, improve nuclear safety and create jobs at home.’ Rolls-Royce is to open a factory in Rotherham to produce components for the plant at Hinkley Point as part of a £400million deal with the French energy giant Areva, supporting 600 jobs in the company and 600 in its supply chain. Meanwhile, EDF will conclude a £100million agreement with Keir/BAM Nuttall for the first construction works at Hinkley Point and will set up a £15million training campus for future nuclear engineers in nearby Bridgwater.

The two countries will also work closely on nuclear defence, swapping the ‘most sensitive dossiers’, the Prime Minister said.

He added: ‘At our last summit, we 
signed a historic partnership on defence. Today, we will match that 
ambition on nuclear energy.’ The deal has been signed against a 
confusing backdrop in the UK. Recently departed Energy Secretary Chris 
Huhne said he was in favour of new nuclear plants only if they were 
funded by the private sector.

His
 successor in the Cabinet, fellow Liberal Democrat Ed Davey, once 
opposed a new generation of nuclear power stations which he said would 
cost taxpayers tens of billions of pounds.

In 2006, Mr Davey said: ‘In addition to posing safety and environmental risks, nuclear power will only be possible with vast taxpayer subsidies or a rigged market.’ But after succeeding Mr Huhne he said he would not oppose the construction of new plants, again so long as they are not subsidised by the taxpayer.

In 2006, as leader of the Opposition, David Cameron was pictured on a sled in Norway to prove his commitment to a green agenda.

In a subsequent article about energy policy for The Independent he failed to mention the word nuclear once.

David Cameron’s nuclear love-in with 
Nicolas Sarkozy is no more than a rerun of a similar event at 10 Downing
 Street when Gordon Brown sold off state-owned British Energy to the 
state-controlled French power giant EDF in 2009.

As
 part of the deal Downing Street encouraged Centrica, owner of British 
Gas, to take a 20 per cent stake in British Energy in an effort to 
demonstrate that the UK was still very much involved in new nuclear 
development.

Similarly,
 this time around the Coalition Government – which has never been 
particularly enthusiastic about nuclear power – has managed to give the 
contracts signed in Paris a British tinge by ensuring that Rolls-Royce 
is among the sub-contractors with £400million of work.

Entente: The two had endured a more frosty reception in recent months after Mr Cameron refused to back an EU treaty to stabilise the euro

Yesterday Downing Street was anxious 
to play up the benefits for Britain, claiming the new facilities will 
create 1,500 jobs. But the reality is that if and when the 
super-powerful nuclear plants are built the main beneficiaries will be 
the leading French engineers Areva, who are in charge of the design, 
licensing and commissioning, and EDF, one of the biggest developers of 
nuclear power across the globe.

A lack of courage and series of 
mistakes by successive governments has meant that Britain’s home-grown 
expertise in the nuclear industry – which made it a pioneer in the 1960s
 and 1970s – has been dissipated and the field left to the French. The 
Blair-Brown government finally put paid to our ambitions to be a leader 
in nuclear technology when state-owned British Nuclear Fuels sold off 
Westinghouse, the world’s leading expert on pressurised nuclear 
reactors, to Toshiba of Japan in 2006 for £3.5billion.

In the run-up to the 2007 election 
New Labour had made it clear that it wanted nothing to do with nuclear 
energy and intended to pursue a renewables agenda. That rapidly changed 
when it became clear that Britain would be left almost entirely 
dependent on imported natural gas supplies over the next decade or so 
unless it adopted a nuclear strategy.

And EDF has had difficulties with a new build in its own backyard in Brittany.

If
 EDF is to become engaged it will require a huge subsidy from consumers.
 The Government will have to guarantee EDF a ‘base price’ for the energy
 it produces. Because of the enormous capital costs of the project it 
will be far higher than the market price for power produced by natural 
gas.

In addition the 
consumer will also have to pay for a £200billion refurbishment of the 
National Grid so it has sufficient capacity to carry the power surge 
from the new nuclear plants.

Households
 in Britain already are struggling to pay their utility bills. But with 
the advent of new nuclear we will place ourselves in hock to overseas 
interests and the bills will be even higher.
