On a variety of topics, he’s not exactly known for pulling any punches.

And Jeremy Clarkson doesn’t hold back when it comes to discussing his own physical condition.

The Top Gear presenter admitted yesterday he has let himself go and put on ‘a lot’ of weight – and that a doctor has branded his fitness level as ‘atrocious’.

Transformation: Jeremy Clarkson pictured looking streamlined in the 1980s, admitted he has let himself go while speaking on The Chris Evans Breakfast Show yesterday

The presenter, who regularly makes headlines for his on-air remarks, spoke on The Chris Evans Breakfast Show.

During the interview, it was pointed out to him that, even with his usual paunch, he appears to have to be ‘a bit’ fatter on the latest Top Gear DVD. 

Clarkson, 54, immediately corrected Evans, saying: ‘Not a bit – a lot fatter.’

Describing his ample stomach as ‘the product of hard work’, he added: ‘I eat a lot but mostly I’ve cultivated it by sitting down all the time. Literally all the time, I’m now exhausted.

Getting to your studio this morning I had to have a 15- minute rest.’ He added: ‘I had to go for a medical the other week. They put me on a treadmill and described my fitness as atrocious.’

The stars of BBC’s Top Gear have been accused of trying to set fire to the cars that embroiled them in a row in Argentina.

The country’s ambassador to the UK has written to the BBC threatening legal action and saying Jeremy Clarkson and his fellow crew members could be guilty of criminal offences.

The TV team fled Argentina in October after it emerged they were using a Porsche with the registration number H982 FKL, seen as a reference to the Falklands conflict of 1982.

The ambassador, Alicia Castro, said they had acted illegally by abandoning and trying to torch the Porsche and two other luxury vehicles. The BBC said: ‘We absolutely refute the suggestion the Top Gear team intended to set fire to the vehicles.’

But Clarkson claims he is not concerned if his weight or outspokenness – he was unrepentant after being drawn into a series of racism rows this year – did lose him the job he has held for more than a decade on the BBC Two show, saying he would simply ‘do something else’.

Earlier this year, it emerged that Clarkson did not always cut such a portly figure. 

Photos from the 1980s showed the presenter as a far skinnier young man, complete with tiny shorts and scrawny legs.

These days the father-of-three has painted himself as a man unable to shy away from indulgence.

He has claimed he cannot write his scripts without ample supplies of alcohol, cigarettes and caffeine, adding: ‘The amount you drink when you’re writing, that’s the thing that worries me.’

And in a recent newspaper column, he wrote: ‘I get tired pulling on my socks these days. 

So, if I want to live much past the end of next weekend [my doctor] says I must give up smoking, drink less, walk more, lose weight.

But in typical nonchalant style, he said of his role on Top Gear: ‘If somebody decides one day that actually you really have got too fat or you really are awful then you do something else.’
