Perhaps the sight of those frenzied shoppers wrestling each other over a discounted TV set has left you wondering where all the traditional Christmas good cheer has gone. The answer is: Dresden.

Christmas markets started in Germany, and Dresden is one of the oldest of the lot.

It is also one of the most glorious. There is not a whiff of Christmas fatigue, no suggestion of a terse ‘let’s do something different this time’ or a tetchy ‘I’m not hosting again after last year’.

City of lights: Dresden really comes to life in November and December, when stalls fill its Altmarkt square

Dresden is delighted to host and celebrate all things Christmas from late November, with most markets closing on Christmas Eve. It feels like its entire population (at about half a million) is on board. There are 11 markets dotted around the city, ranging from a handful of stalls lining a small passageway to the River Elbe to large affairs with mini fairground rides and candyfloss. The oldest (now in its 580th year) and most celebrated is the Striezelmarkt on Altmarkt Square in the old town.

We gather here as daylight fades for the grand opening. It involves a welcome speech from the city’s mayor, songs from a young woman in huge angel wings and a man dressed as a miner, a band, and then, as darkness falls and fairy lights in the fir trees twinkle, an enormous stollen cake (2,014 cm long in honour of the year, and pictured right) is brought to the stage by the city’s bakers.

Stollen cake (well, the original and authentic version anyway) is exclusive to Dresden and Christmas. This one arrives with such fanfare that it should come with police outriders.

Gifts of all shapes and sizes: Visitors can pick up all manner of Christmas presents at the Striezelmarkt

Love hearts and sugary serenades: Baked goods are always a key element of any German Christmas market

There is an almost tangible sense of festivity and community as young families, couples and groups of friends wander around nearly 250 wooden stalls. There is also a strong and irresistible aroma of warm gluhwein, roasting chestnuts, bratwurst, and an entire cow roasting on a spit.

Between the food and the handbags, sweets, handmade jewellery, blown-glass ornaments, woollen hats, scarves and gloves, pottery, toys, candles and sheepskin slippers, you could wrap up most of your Christmas shopping here in an afternoon.

It is one big, romantic, cosy grotto, and there’s something touchingly sincere about the market. Perhaps this is because so many of the stalls are selling handmade things. There are no madly hiked prices and nothing that looks like it would break the minute you got it home.

Much smaller than the Striezelmarkt, and completely charming, is the medieval Stallhof market in the shadow of the castle. It is tucked away down a passageway and, as well as handmade jewellery and bunches of mistletoe, it is full of surprises.

Fun for visitors of all ages: Dresden's markets are a magical affair for even the youngest of visitors

There are crates of wine in bottles like huge bell-bottomed test tubes, a stall devoted to ropes and twine, a smithy with antique bellows the size of a VW Beetle, and a wooden toy stall where I spy primary-coloured catapults, bows and arrows and even an axe, which would make for a lively Christmas.

We are staying at the swish Swissotel in the old town, and it’s a pleasure to stroll the quiet streets amid the spectacular skyline of spires and domes — rebuilt, original brick by original brick where possible — after 15 sq miles of Dresden’s centre was almost levelled in 1945 by the Allied bombing raids.

Our guide, Cosima, shows us black-and-white photos of the rubble and craters.

It’s affecting. The Zwinger Palace, Frauenkirche (Church) and the Semper Opera House look even more mighty and imposing when you realise how painstakingly they were put back together.

We pass the baroque Hofkirche, built on the orders of the 17th-century ruler August the Strong. August’s heart is buried in a silver capsule in the crypt and will, according to Cosima, beat again when a beautiful woman walks past it. It seems a fitting test, as August apparently had 12 mistresses and a wife, all of whom he built palaces for.

Local delicacy: Stollen cake originated in Dresden, and is still a key feature of the city's Christmas markets

His favourite mistress was ensconced in Taschenberg Palace (now a hotel), though she overstepped her place and spent the last 49 years of her life in prison.

But we don’t dwell on her fate. It’s Christmas, after all, and Dresden is one big irresistible advent calendar, with a Santa’s hat on top.

And not a flat-screen scrap or an Xbox brawl in sight.
