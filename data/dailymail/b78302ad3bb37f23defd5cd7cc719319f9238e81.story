Kris Bradley wept as he was found guilty of attempted murder following a hammer attack on Matthew Probert in Lincoln

A man who smashed a promising rugby player’s skull with a claw hammer so hard that bone splinters embedded into his brain wept as he was found guilty of attempted murder today.

Matthew Probert, 21, was left with 'life-changing' injuries after he was attacked by Kris Bradley, 23, after he accidentally bumped into him in a bar.

Mr Probert was on a night out at the Walkabout bar in Lincoln with team mates from Scunthorpe Rugby Club celebrating a friend’s 21st birthday when he was set upon by Bradley.

Pictures taken by bystanders show a dazed Mr Probert slumped on the ground with 
the hammer  embedded in his forehead following the brutal attack on August 
31 last year.

He later told court he had no idea he had the tool stuck in his head until he was in the ambulance - when he tried to wrench it out of his skull himself.

Bradley sobbed uncontrollably as he was found guilty of attempted murder following a five-day trial at Birmingham Crown Court.

Bradley’s friend Daniel Burrell, 22, who supplied him with the hammer was found guilty of assisting an offender.

The jury of eight men and four women returned a majority verdict after four-and-a-half hours of deliberations.

A third man, Alex Taylor, 21, who was with Bradley when he attacked Mr Probert, admitted assisting an offender at an earlier hearing.

The court had heard that Bradley and Taylor decided to set upon Mr Probert after a row erupted in the Walkabout bar in Lincoln city centre.

The three men were booted out of the pub and continued arguing in the street before Mr Probert walked away.

Bradley and Taylor then planned to 'mete out revenge' and stalked him through the streets until they corned him in an alleyway.

The court heard Bradley called Burrell and told him to bring him a hammer which he used to batter the young rugby player.

Prosecutor Gordon Aspden told the jury: 'They wanted to mete out revenge.

'Kris
 Bradley called Daniel Burrell and asked him for help. Daniel Burrell 
drove into the city and brought with him a claw hammer.

'On arrival Kris Bradley collected that claw hammer from Burrell’s Vauxhall Corsa and hid it in the waist band of his trousers.

'While Daniel Burrell waited they then set out to find Matthew Probert with the hammer.

'They eventually found him, alone, walking in a side street.

'Kris
 Bradley approached him from behind, followed by Alex Taylor, he took 
the hammer out of the waistband of his trousers and struck Mr Probert 
with it on the head.

'The 
force of the blow penetrated into his skull. The two claws went through 
the left side of his forehead, through his skull and into his brain.

'Matthew Probert was taken completely by surprise. He collapsed on the pavement with the hammer left inside his skull.

'Job done, Kris Bradley ran back to Daniel Burrell’s car followed by Alex Taylor.'

Rugby player Matthew Probert was left with life-changing injuries, the court heard

Bradley was caught when he ran into a car and left a hand print on the bonnet.

Police used the print to identify him using the national database.

The
 court heard Bradley and Burrell sent callous text messages to each 
other just hours after the brutal attack, joking about getting 
'hammered' and having a 'smashing time'.

Yesterday Bradley was remanded into custody and warned he faced a long prison sentence when he returns to court on March 31.

Judge
 Melbourne Inman QC said: 'Obviously whilst a prison sentence is 
inevitable, it seems to me the dangerousness (of Bradley) needs to be 
considered.

'This is now the fourth time you have been involved in violence and no doubt being drunk in public.

'A long custodial sentence is obviously inevitable, until then you will be remanded in custody.'

Burrell and Taylor were bailed and ordered to return to court on the same day for sentencing.

Mr
 Probert was taken to Lincoln City Hospital before being transferred to a
 neurosurgery unit at Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, with the 
hammer still embedded in his skull.

He
 told the court he was so stunned by the ferocity of the attack he only 
realised what had happened when he was in the ambulance and he tried to 
wrench out the hammer by hand.

In a statement read to the court, he said: 'I remember being served a drink at Walkabout, but nothing more.

'My
 next memory is the handle of something sticking out of my head in the 
ambulance. I tried to reach and take it out but the paramedic stopped 
me.

'It was only in the hospital that a nurse told me it was a hammer.'

Mr Probert, who did not attend the trial, was yesterday said to be 'delighted' with the verdict.

His girlfriend Elisha Davis, 21, of Scunthorpe, said: 'Obviously we are delighted with the verdict. 

'The last few months have been very difficult for Matthew but he is now in a position to be able to start to put it behind him.'

Hungate in Lincoln where promising rugby star Mr Probert was attacked with the claw hammer

His
 father Mark Probert, 48, said: 'We are pleased with the outcome of the 
investigation into the horrific assault on my son Matthew, he could died
 and even now he is struggling to come to terms with what happened to 
him on the night in question. 

'I
 would like to thank the ambulance crew and the hospital staff who cared
 for him. I am also grateful for all the hard work of the police and the
 prosecution team.

'Matthew
 does not wish to speak to the media but I hope to be there when the 
offenders are sentenced and will issue a more detailed statement then.'

Investigating officer Detective Sergeant Cunningham, of Lincolnshire Police, said: 'We are very pleased with these convictions. 

'The
 outcome of this case could have been very different, if you strike 
someone on the head with a claw hammer there is a very high likelihood 
that they will be killed or very seriously injured. 

'I
 would like to thank the police team, the CPS and the whole prosecution 
team for their very thorough and professional work on this case.'
