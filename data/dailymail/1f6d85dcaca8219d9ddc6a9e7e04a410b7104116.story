The Ministry of Justice have said it would be 'difficult or impossible' for Ched Evans to work abroad, meaning the convicted rapist may never play professional football again.

The 25-year-old is looking to return to football after being released from prison in October, but the striker's former club Sheffield United bowed to pressure on Thursday and withdrew their offer to allow Evans to train with them.

No other clubs in the Football League have expressed an interest in signing Evans, and the Ministry of Justice have confirmed it is unlikely the ex-Wales international can rebuild his career abroad.

'In general terms, a sex offender on licence would have to have regular meetings with their offender manager and that is difficult or impossible to do if they are living abroad,' a spokesman told MailOnline.

Evans, who plans to appeal his 2012 conviction for raping a teenage waitress in a hotel in Rhyl, served half of his five-year sentence. The remainder of the sentence will be completed on licence, meaning he must regularly check in with an offender manager until 2016.

Evans will be 27 by the time that has been fulfilled, and he will remain on the Sex Offenders Register for life.

He was initially told he could train with his former team in Sheffield after his release from Wymott Prison on October 17, but the League One club performed a U-turn following high profile criticism.

 Evans released a statement protesting his innocence against the conviction with Massey by his side

Among those was Olympic champion Jessica Ennis-Hill, who vowed to have her name removed from one of the stands at Bramall Lane if Evans was re-signed, and TV presenter Charlie Webster, who quit as a patron of the club.

A petition gathered more than 150,000 signatures against Evans re-joining the Blades, and the club released a statement severing their relationship with the convicted rapist.

‘Following the statement dated 11th November and after ongoing and extensive deliberation, Sheffield United Football Club has decided to retract the opportunity for its former player, Ched Evans, to use the club’s facilities for training purposes, as was previously intended,' it read.

'The club initially accepted a request from The PFA (Professional Footballers' Association) for Ched Evans to be able to train. The reaction to this has been at an intensity that could not have been anticipated when first announced.

'The club condemns rape and violence of any kind against women in the strongest possible terms.'

The PFA accepted the club's decision but added it hopes Evans will find a club.

'It may ultimately be of benefit to both parties to move on and for Ched to look for a fresh start at a different club,' a statement on Friday read.

'It is hoped that Ched will be given an opportunity at another club to return to the job he is trained to do.'
