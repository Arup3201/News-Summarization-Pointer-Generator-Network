George Osborne was turned away from a town centre cafe - because the owner was too busy with the lunchtime rush.

Amanda Biggs was approached by the Chancellor’s aides the day before he made a whistle stop tour of Bolton yesterday.

But she said it wouldn’t have been fair to her regulars at the Thyme Deli and Cafe in Horwich, Bolton.

Amanda Biggs, the owner of Thyme Deli in Horwich, Bolton, turned away George Osborne because she was too busy with the lunchtime rush

Ms Biggs said: 'They initially just told me it was a senior figure but didn’t tell me it was George Osborne, even if they had it wouldn’t have made any difference.

'I had to tell them no because they wanted to reserve seating for 10 people at our busiest time.

'As a local business I didn’t want to tell my regular customers that they couldn’t come in because that wouldn’t be fair and wouldn’t be good for business.'

She stressed her decision had 'absolutely nothing to do with politics'.

Ms Biggs added: 'This was purely a 
business decision, If Mr Osborne had wanted to come and speak to me 
about my shop at a later time then that would have been fine - this 
wasn’t politically motivated and it certainly wasn’t a PR stunt for the 
shop.

'This is the same decision I would make every time.'

Amanda Biggs said it would not have been fair to her regulars to give up one of her tables for the Chancellor

Mr
 Osborne visited businesses in the town's Winter Hey Lane to find out 
how the economy was coping and to campaign for Chris Green, the Tory 
candidate for Bolton West at next year’s general election.

An aide to the Chancellor insisted he was not offended. He said: 'We totally understand that because they are so busy at lunchtime they couldn't take a reservation for a meeting with local businesses.

'Next time George is in Bolton he will definitely try it out. He is on the side of all hardworking people who are running their own business.'

Despite not being able to stop for a coffee the Tatton MP and his group called into Cafe Latte and Home Bakery.

Diane Farrimond, aged 50, who works in the shop, said: 'We didn’t actually get to sit down with him because we were so busy running around serving people.

'I do think it is good that these politicians are visiting us. They should do it more but if I’m honest I don’t think his government are helping us.'

Mr Osborne also called into J.Greeley Butchers.

Owner Duncan Greeley said: 'I wasn’t star struck or anything, the Chancellor is just a title - it makes no difference to me.

'Things are very tough for businesses like mine at the moment.'

Mr Osborne's cafe snub came after the Prime Minister visited a branch of Nandos in Bristol for a meal.

David Cameron did not face the same difficulty being allowed into Nandos in Bristol as the Chancellor faced getting a cup of tea in Bolton

David Cameron visited the fast food chain - famous for its spicy peri-peri chicken and chips - with aides last night.

A Downing Street spokeswoman said Mr Cameron ate chicken and coleslaw at Nando's.

Asked whether he checked if the meal he was ordering was halal, following days of controversy over restaurants' use of meat slaughtered according to the traditional Muslim ritual, the spokeswoman said: 'The Prime Minister is comfortable with the meat he eats and buys.'

She added: 'I don't think it's unusual for someone at the end of the working day to want to go and have a meal.'
