Horrifying: Dwayne Ward, 17, is fighting for his life following the attack in Turkey

A group of attackers who stripped a British teenager naked and 'stabbed him 17 times' for kissing a local girl in a Turkish bar also tried to slit his wrists to 'finish him off'.

Dwayne Ward, 17, was found with his wrists slashed and his body soaked in blood in a garden in the Tepe district of Marmaris by locals.

The teenager, who has been enjoying a night out with his older brother on Tuesday, is now out of intensive care after fighting for his life, and doctors hope he will fully recover, The Sun reported.

A police report revealed Dwayne said: 'I was having fun while I was out and I kissed a Turkish girl at the bar I was in.'

'I went to another bar and that was when they hit me in the head with a hard object.'

He then added, according to The Sun: 'I don't remember the rest.'

The teenager, from Middlesbrough, Cleveland, was on holiday with his brother Darren, 32, and their mother Doris.Â 

He was found at 7.30am with injuries including cuts to the throat, chest, groin, legs and back.

The teenager was taken to the intensive care unit of the Marmaris State Hospital and was initially in a critical condition.

Anxious wait: Today Dwayne Ward's mother Doris, right, and brother Darren, 32, left, were seen waiting outside Marmaris State Hospital as he underwent further surgery - he was found stabbed over a dozen times on Tuesday

Around 270 officers had been deployed
on the case. Between them they watched footage from 217 CCTV cameras 
over 48 hours finally getting a clear clip of Ismail A, 24, and Attila 
Dincer, 26, closing in on Dwayne.

Police CCTV clearly shows Dwayne 
wobbling down a deserted street as his two alleged attackers move in behind him.
Attila Dincer, 31, links arm with the drunken Dwayne as Ismail A, walks
on his other side.

Marmaris police showed photos of the 
pair to hundreds of locals ultimately leading to the identification and 
arrest of Attila who quickly gave up his accomplice.

The pair are now in custody having reportedly 
admitted the attack.

Attila is facing charges of robbery and wounding 
with intent while Ismail is charged with robbery and attempted murder 
crimes which can carry prison sentences of up to 36 years.

Suspect: Attila Dincer (blue T-shirt) is led away by police. He is being questioned in connection with the stabbing of 17-year-old Dwaine Ward in the Turkish resort town of Marmaris

Ismail A, 24, the second suspect being questioned. He was arrested on a bus in Konya, 354 miles from Marmaris

Troubling time: Older brother Darren, visits the police station to give evidence

Dincer was arrested in the early hours of
Thursday morning and shortly after Ismail from Aksaray, was 
arrested on a bus in Konya, 354 miles away.

Using information believed to have 
come from Dincer, Turkish police in Mugla liased with other forces 
across the country - tracking Ismail on a bus heading for his home town.

According
to police and hospital reports Dwayne had been stabbed more than a 
dozen times including twice in the throat and several times in the 
chest. It is said to have pierced his heart.

It is said he had also been stabbed in the groin, legs and back and his arms had been slashed with a razor.

Today family and friends today spoke of their horror after the 'quiet, decent' football-loving teen was attacked.

Carolyn Ward, a relative of Dwayne's,
said: 'It has been a massive shock to the family, his dad Wayne is due 
to fly out out to Turkey soon.

Two British men are believed to have died in separate drowning incidents in Turkey, while a teenager is fighting for his life after he was stabbed ten times

'From what we understand his 
condition has improved slightly and we are hoping that proves to be the 
case. He's such a nice, quiet young lad, it's hard to believe he's been 
set on like this.'

Dwayne's uncle, Vincent Ward said: 'It's hit everyone very hard, his Dad's in bits about it but is going out there tomorrow.'

Wayne Hand, 17, a former school friend at Middlesbrough's Macmillan Academy, which Dwayne left last year.

Wayne said: 'He's a really nice genuine lad and definitely not the sort to go looking for trouble.

'If he got into bother it will have come to him because he's just not one of those people who invites it.

At school he was quiet and well liked.

'After leaving MacMillan he moved on 
to Middlesbrough College and that's where he's studying now, I think 
it's something sports based.

People on Belcekiz beach called paramedics after noticing that a body, believed to be that of Anthony Gissing, was floating in the sea without moving

'He's a good footballer and loves 
sport of all kinds. There have been loads of people on Twitter and 
Facebook this morning talking about him as word has spread of what's 
happened.

'He's a very popular lad and we're all totally shocked. We just want to see him him recovered and home as soon as possible.'

Neighbours at the family's neat semi 
detached home were also shocked by the news that Dwayne had been left 
fighting for his life.

One neighbour said: 'He is a 
respectable, decent lad from a nice family. He is certainly not the sort
of kid who would have gone looking for trouble.

'He spent most of his time kicking a football around at the back of the house either on his own or with his mates.

The attack took place after the young 
man and his older brother, had been out drinking in the 
town's Bar Street on Monday night.

The brothers had reportedly become separated among the crowds and Darren had returned to their hotel alone.

The
brothers are believed to be on holiday with their mother- staying at 
the privately run Ali Baba Otel close to the town's busy market place.

The local dignitaries from the popular Mediterranean seaside town took flowers and chocolates when they visited the family to offer their apologies for the brutal attack which took place in their resort.

Speaking
from the Ali Baba Otel, his mother said: 'Dwayne's 
facing another operation this morning. His dad's flying out from the UK 
to be with him.

'I'm too distressed to talk about it.'

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) confirmed hospitalisation of the teenager.
