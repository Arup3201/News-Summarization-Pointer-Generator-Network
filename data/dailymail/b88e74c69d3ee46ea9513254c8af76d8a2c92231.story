Crackdown: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said a tougher approach is needed with prisoners who brag that the system is easy

Two violent thugs caught boasting of their easy prison life on Facebook have been stripped of their perks, put in segregation and face a police investigation.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling reacted with fury to the pictures published in yesterday’s Mail showing Sonny Barker and Korrel Kennedy posing in their cell and surrounded by gadgets.

Mr Grayling demanded the prison authorities ‘throw the book’ at the pair, who now face having up to 42 extra days added to their sentences.

The thugs – whose antics have sparked a new ‘soft justice’ row – have lost their TV, are being made to wear prison uniform and could be moved to a tougher jail. Police have also been informed.

Having a mobile phone in jail is a criminal offence carrying a two-year sentence, but prison officials rarely bother to call in the police.

Mr Grayling is determined that faith in the entire prison system should not be undermined by thugs boasting on Facebook.

Between July 2009 and June 2011 a shocking 342 inmates, including murderers, were caught using the social networking site while locked up.

The pictures show Barker and Kennedy with a PlayStation, as well as a TV that is showing a music channel.

Other pictures appear to show a cell filled with a mini-fridge, sound system, piles of snacks and posters of topless women.

Barker, 20, was jailed for eight years after he held a mother and daughter at knifepoint in their home during a burglary.

But the serial offender smuggled a phone into his cell at HMP Rochester in Kent to show off his cushy surroundings.

Kennedy, 20, a former Jean Paul Gaultier model, was jailed for chasing a man with a knife and threatening hospital staff.

Bragging: Sonny Barker (left) and Korrel Kennedy (right) posted pictures with a mobile phone they were not supposed to have. Carrying a phone is a criminal offence and carries a two-year sentence

Consequences: The men have had their TV taken away and have been forced to wear prison uniforms. They could face an extra 42 days on top of their jail terms

In his first post on Facebook on June 
29, Barker wrote: ‘What’s happening! Coming from live from prison. Whos 
(sic) missing me.’ He added: ‘I’ll be home soon. Real soon December 
2015.’

When one friend wrote he had ‘it on 
smash’ – prison slang for living an easy life inside – he replied: ‘When
 haven’t I had it on smash? Admit it, been bossing since Elmley 
[Prison].’

HMP Rochester is
 a Category C young offender institution for 650 males deemed 
untrustworthy and likely to try to escape. Past inspections have found 
evidence of bullying and a Fight Club-style culture.

The men now face being moved to a 
Category B jail. Decisions on whether to add days to their sentences 
will be taken by an independent adjudicator within days.

Last
 night a Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘We are introducing a tough
 new regime in our prisons, and we are serious about enforcing it.

'Prisoners are not allowed to access social networking sites, and we do not tolerate this kind of behaviour.

‘When an offender breaks the rules, we strip them of their privileges and they are dealt with severely. This is the right thing to do, and it sends a clear signal to any other prisoner who might step out of line.’

Mr Grayling has made a determined effort to stop prisons being seen as ‘holiday camps’.

But there are concerns that the tough message has yet to properly filter down to individual jails, with governors taking action over Facebook only when a minister intervenes. Ministers have now issued new guidelines reminding jails of their duty to act.
