Sugenth Jeyakumar, 14, died after being injured during a tackle in a PE lesson football game at Whitmore High School in Harrow, north London

A 14-year-old schoolboy has died after making a sliding tackle in a football match during a school PE lesson.

Sugenth Jeyakumar was playing with classmates when he slid in for a tackle on the astroturf pitch at Whitmore High School in Harrow, north west London.

The teenager, who was in Year 10 at the school, was taken to Northwick Park Hospital following the incident last Tuesday but died from his injuries soon after.

It is believed he suffered a severe knock to the chest, causing internal bleeding which led to his death.

The coroner has been informed and an inquest is due to take place next year.

Tributes have now been paid to the youngster, who has been described as a 'great lad' and an 'amazing friend, caring brother and loving son'.

A Facebook group in tribute to the teenager says: 'May you rest in peace - you're now in a better place. Much love.'

Jack Dowling, a friend of Sugenth, wrote on the social media site: 'RIP brother I miss u man we will never forget u miss u sitting in rmt history and business gone but never forgotten always loved miss u bro. (sic)'

Schoolfriend George Rance also wrote: 'R.I.P - everyones thoughts are with your family and friends.'

Vitushan Lulu Krishnamohan added: 'Truly a great lad. Doesn't deserve to have his life taken. R.I.P.'

And Colin Gall said: 'RIP sad news. Lovely guy gone too young.'

Meanwhile, a friend on Twitter, writing under the name Nikita, wrote: 'RIP Sugenth you will be missed by everyone can't believe you're already gone. Hope you're looking down on everyone and smiling.'

And another, under the name Holly, said: 'Boy in the year above me died today on the football pitch - RIP Sugenth you will be missed.'

Sue Hammond, headteacher of Whitmore High School, said Sugenth had a 'great future ahead of him'.
