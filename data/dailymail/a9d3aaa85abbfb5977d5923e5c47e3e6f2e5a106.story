Petrol prices are plummeting towards the one dollar per litre mark just in time for the Christmas holiday season.

The national average for petrol prices is currently $1.21 per litre with prices as low as $1.09 in Sydney on Tuesday. 

The last time motorists saw the average petrol price in Australia drop below a dollar was back in 2005 between February 14-20, the Australian Financial Review reports. 

'If we don't get to a dollar, we will get very close to it,' NRMA spokesman Peter Khoury said.

Despite the slump in oil prices, companies in Australia are not using the recent drop  to inflate petrol prices for consumers.

'With Coles and Woolies setting their price at $1.14, I can't see the independents putting their prices up any time soon,' Mr Khoury said. 

'I think like the rest of the country, the NRMA would be over the moon about sub-one dollar petrol.

It comes as the NRMA's director Alan Evans called on petrol companies to pass on savings that are currently being seen in Sydney, with petrol still more expensive in Brisbane, Canberra, Darwin and Tasmania.

The average petrol price in Sydney last Friday was $1.16 per litre.

'The supermarkets and their associated oil companies should be Santa Claus and not Scrooge to Canberra motorists,' Mr Evans said. 

'A large supermarket chain has capped prices in the Sydney metropolitan area at $1.14 or less until 4 January next year while independent retailers are offering regular unleaded in Sydney as low as $1.12 per litre.

'We would to see the petrol companies extend this Christmas gift.'

The drop in fuel prices equates to an annualised $2.5 billion reduction in household expenses since October, according to figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. 

Commsec chief economist Craig James told Business Insider acts like a tax cut and the savings put more money in people's pockets. 

'Families are saving $32 a month compared with a year ago,' he said.
