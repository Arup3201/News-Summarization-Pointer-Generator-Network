Is this the lumpiest road in Britain?

A 94-yard village street with just 16 semi-detached homes has residents fuming after they counted 80 potholes.

They will have to endure the bumps through winter as there is no money left to repair Rothbury Avenue, South Tyneside - and there is no guarantee it will be done next year either.

Driven potty: Winter has only just begun but residents of bumpy Rothbury Avenue in Monkton Village, South Tyneside, have counted 80 potholes. There is no money left to fix them until at least next spring

Appalling: How one resident described the road, claiming it was the worst in Britain - is yours even worse?

Funding gap: Labour South Tyneside Council says it will not prioritise the street because it is a minor road

Frederick Lazenby, 80, has launched a petition calling on South Tyneside Council to fix Rothbury Avenue, in Monkton Village.

He said: 'It's in a terrible state. It has been like this since I moved in 30 years ago. It has just got worse and worse.

'There
are a lot of old people in the street and those in wheelchairs are 
having difficulty getting across the road. Those driving cars are 
finding the road terrible as well.

'They are trying to dodge them but you can't anymore - there are that many of them.

'It is definitely worse than any other street in Britain that I know of.'

Resident Frederick Lazenby, 80, said: 'Those in wheelchairs are having difficulty getting across the road'

Residents of the street's 16 houses have threatened to sue the council if their cars are damaged by the bumps

A Nightmare on Rothbury Avenue: The street in Monkton Village, South Tyneside, is just 94 yards long

South Tyneside Council says repairing the road will cost £5,157, a price it cannot afford - because its road repairs budget has already dried up.

Executive director Mike Conlon said: 'The council's current mainstream road resurfacing budget is fully committed for the current year.

Councils across England and Wales have united to claim potholes will hit 'crisis point' this winter.

They begged the government for more cash, saying years of spending cuts meant projects already 'on the back burner' were being delayed further and further.

Transport chairman for the Local Government Association, Cllr Peter Box, blamed 'decades of underfunding by Whitehall'.

He said in March: 'We're now facing a bill of £10.5 billion to bring our roads up to scratch. Unless something changes we risk swathes of Britain's road network becoming dangerously strewn with potholes, particularly if flooding and severe winters become more common.'

Potholes appear over winter when water repeatedly freezes and thaws inside cracks in the road surface, opening them wider.

Most councils use instant 'emergency repairs' to fix danger potholes, but these have to be followed up with a permanent, more expensive fix which many authorities say they are struggling to afford.

'Rothbury Avenue will be considered for resurfacing during the next financial year commencing in April 2014.

'It
should be noted, however, that there is no guarantee that funding will 
be available. The street is a quiet cul-de-sac and major roads and bus 
routes will take priority.'

He added there had already been 'extensive' pothole repairs carried out in recent years 
to keep the road safe.

Resident Brenda Melia, 67, said: 'I am disgusted at the decision. There is another winter ahead 
and it is only going to get worse.

'It
is going to cost the council more in the long-term. If my car is 
damaged when reversing I'll be claiming off them, that's for sure.'

Her husband Dennis, 69, added: 'The 
council keeps going on about Monkton Village being Jarrow's jewel in the
crown and yet they are allowing the road outside our homes to get into 
this state. It is damaging the look of the area.

'What
would happen if I had to put my house up for sale and a prospective 
buyer came and saw the state of road? There's no way I could sell it at 
its true value.'

Another resident, who did not want to be named, said: 'I think it is very dangerous. In this street 80 to 85 per cent of residents are old aged pensioners. I am 80 years old and my wife is 79.

'There is a lady in a wheelchair who has to travel up the street to find a safer part of the road to cross. The whole surface of the road is falling to pieces.'

'I am appalled by the state of it. If it was Councillors' Row it would be done immediately. It is only going to get worse when the bad weather comes.'
