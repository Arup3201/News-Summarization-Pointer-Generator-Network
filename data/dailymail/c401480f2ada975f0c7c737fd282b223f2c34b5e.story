An 18-year-old football star has been shot dead accidentally by a 17-year-old friend who had allegedly been drinking while they were on a hunting trip.

Nate Maki's body was found in a pickup truck in a field near Bowie, Texas at 11.30pm on Saturday after his friend Michael Underwood accidentally shot him once in the head with a rifle.

Underwood, who had been camping with Maki and two female friends in the field before a day of hunting, alerted authorities, who found beer cans, a rifle and a shotgun at the scene.

The body was found on the 
driver’s side of a 2008 Chevrolet extended-cab pickup owned by 
Underwood's grandfather, authorities said. He was pronounced dead at Bowie Memorial Hospital.

Loss: Nathan Maki, 18, is pictured with his girlfriend Peyton Bucklew. He was killed on Saturday while on a camping trip after a 17-year-old friend accidentally shot him with a rifle as he sat in a truck

Underwood was arrested at the scene and charged with a minor for alcohol consumption but freed on bail the next day. Authorities are investigating who provided the teenagers with the alcohol.

Sheriff Paul 
Cunningham said the four teenagers were camping on property owned by Underwood’s uncle and 
were waiting for dove season to officially begin Sunday so they could hunt.

He called the shooting a tragic accident but did not reveal exactly how the gun went off.

'At this
time there’s no evidence of this being an intentional shooting, and 
it’s an extreme tragedy to all those involved,' he said.

The two teenage girls immediately fled the scene after Maki was shot dead.

Trip: Maki, pictured, was camping on the land he was due to go hunting with three other friends on Sunday

'Their
best friend just died,' Cunningham said, CBSDFW reported. 'There was alcohol involved. They were scared 
and just fled the scene. That's not uncommon.'

Investigators found the girls and interview them. The investigation is ongoing and the next stage will involve presenting evidence to the district attorney to see if he wants to pursue charges.

'Safe rooms' have been set up for students returning to Guyer High School, where Maki studied and played on the football team, for the first day since losing their classmate. Students can talk with counselors or write notes to the Maki family in the rooms.

He leaves behind a girlfriend, fellow sports player Peyton Bucklew, who told NDCDFW that Maki was her 'best friend'. Photos on Facebook show the couple grinning side by side in their uniforms.

Scene: His body, which had suffered a bullet to the head, was found in a parked pickup truck on the land

Support: Students at area high schools have shown their support by writing 33 - Maki's jersey number - on their wrists and by holding memorial services. His funeral was held on Thursday morning

'Football
was everything to him,' she said. 'Those
are his brothers out there. He would do anything for 
them. It will be hard, but I know they are going to go out 
there and play for him.'

Guyer Head Coach John Walsh told the Denton Record-Chronicle he was shocked at the death.

'As a coach or administrator, you don't prepare for anything like this,' he said. 'But Guyer's a strong family and we're going to take care of the Makis along the way.'

Oschlor Flemming, who coaches the running backs for the high school team, added: 'Nathan [was] a great kid... He always had a big smile on his face. I don't think he had an enemy in the world.'

He added: 'The hardest thing about being a coach, you're used to being able to fix stuff for these kids. That's the hardest part about watching these kids. You know you can't fix it.'
