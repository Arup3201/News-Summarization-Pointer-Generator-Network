QPR manager Harry Redknapp says the club are building for a season with striker Loic Remy, despite the Frenchman coming close to a move to Liverpool last month.

Redknapp was in dire need of the 27-year-old in front of goal during Saturday's 1-0 friendly defeat to PAOK at Loftus Road, the Hoops taking 70 minutes to test the opposition goalkeeper.

Remy, who may have scared off potential buyers with a failed medical at Anfield, has been superb in training, according to Redknapp.

'We're all geared up for him to stay,' he said. 'He's fine, he has trained great and his attitude has been first-class. I couldn't have asked for more from him.

'He's here and he wants to work and get in the team.'

Clint Hill's own goal late on rounded off an uninspiring performance in front of a sparse crowd, but new £6millon midfielder Jordon Mutch played the full 90 minutes on his debut.

Rio Ferdinand and Steven Caulker started in a five-man defence, and looked assured enough in front of a bombardment from the Greek Superleague runners up to give QPR real hope of avoiding relegation comfortably this season.

PAOK hit the post and forced two fine saves from Rob Green, with Charlie Austin's header, cleared off the line, representing the hosts' best effort.

Junior Hoilett was tested to lead the line with Austin, but QPR fans feel another striker would round off a successful summer. Remy would be like a new signing.

Redknapp admitted the squad was short, but insists the Remy situation has not affected his search in the transfer market.

'Not at all, it shouldn't do. But we need the squad, we need to strengthen. [Pre-season] hasn't been great, we haven't had very good games.

'Hopefully with a weeks training Loic will be fit to play next week.'
