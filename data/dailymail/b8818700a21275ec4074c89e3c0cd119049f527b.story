(San Antonio lead the series 2-0)

Tony Parker scored a game-high 22 points to help the San Antonio Spurs beat the Oklahoma City Thunder to take a 2-0 series lead in the Western Conference Finals.

Point guard Parker added five assists to his haul, as the Spurs ran out 112-77 winners at their AT&T Center.

Shooting guard Danny Green hit seven three-pointers in his 21-point haul as San Antonio took control of the match at half-time.

The 26-year-old made two shoots from 
downtown in the final two-and-a-half minutes of the second quarter to 
turn the hosts three-point deficit into a 14-point lead.

Tim Duncan reached his 153rd career play-off double-double with 14 points and 12 rebounds, as the Spurs recorded a seventh win from their last eight matches by a margin of 21.9 points.

For the Thunder, the season-ending absence of the influential Serge Ibaka looks to have had a detrimental affect on the No 2 seeds as they struggle to contain the Spurs attack.

Oklahoma's MVP Kevin Durant and Russell Westbook again led their efforts with 15 points apiece.

However, the dynamic duo struggled to break through the San Antonio defence, which was highlighted by Durant's scoreless drought of 14 minutes and 43 seconds in the first-half.

It was only the fifth time from 69 play-off games where he had failed to score less than 20 points.

The scoreline of the match became so one-sided that Thunder coach Scott Brooks pulled Durant and Westbrook out of the game with 1 minute and 47 seconds left in the third quarter.

After the game Brooks demanded a response from his players after the defeat: 'We're a much better team than we played tonight,' he said.

'We've got three or four days to figure it out. We've been in this position before. We don't want to be in this position, but we are.'

Game 3 takes place on Sunday at Oklahoma's Chesapeake Energy Arena.
