Townsend Griffiss was the first US air force officer was killed in Europe, following America's entry into World War II

This is the face of a forgotten hero -
the first U.S. air force officer killed in Europe after America's entry
into the Second World War.

Fighter pilot Lt Col Townsend 
Griffiss was highly regarded by the 
military but his name was, until now, virtually lost to history.

He was the first of 30,000 American airmen to lose their lives in the bloody conflict - shot down in friendly fire after the plane he travelling in was tragically mistaken for a German aircraft on February 15 1942 on its way from Cairo to the UK.

Now, on the 70th anniversary of his death this week, his contribution to the war effort is being remembered in a feature for the BBC's online news magazine.

His death at 41 led to improved training for airmen to help them recognise the differences between military and civilian aircraft.

He also helped establish a key supply route across Siberia for American lend-lease aircraft.

There is no memorial to Lt Col Griffiss in the UK, although the US
Army Air Force named their British headquarters after him, Camp 
Griffiss, at the Teddington end of Bushy Park, in west London, which has now been demolished.

Another airbase in New York was also named after him.

Born in San Diego in California to a 
wealthy well-to-do family Lt Col Griffiss was a keen polo player.

He trained as a fighter pilot and served in Hawaii in the 1920s.

After being posted to bases in California and Texas he worked in Paris and Berlin as an air attache from 1935. Between 1936 and 1938 he excelled in his observations
and analysis of the civil war in Spain.Â 

This was seen as a way to test 
military technologies and the U.S. government wanted information on how 
aircraft and tanks were used and deployed.

In September 1940 the U.S. had agreed to
help Britain in the conflict and provide the nation with 50 naval 
destroyers in return for the lease of military bases in various 
territories.

Following his stint in Spain and another stint in the U.S. he arrived in London at the end of the Blitz, in 1941, becoming a special observer unofficially 
preparing for the military alliance with Britain following Pearl 
Harbour. His aide was Gen James Chaney.

However, in November that year, he 
left his post and was sent to Moscow to work with the Soviet government 
trying to negotiate the opening of a Siberian supply route for American 
lend-lease aircraft.

The existing route to Russia from the UK was via the Middle East which took longer.

Despite two months of conversations 
with Russia, his bid to create the new delivery route failed, but bad 
weather meant it was impossible for him to return to Britain straight 
away.

It was the start of a series of events which led to his death, following which he was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal.

He travelled to Tehran and then to Cairo where he boarded an unarmed B-24 Liberator to the UK operated by the British Overseas Airways Corporation.

This type of plane later became one 
of the most familiar heavy bombers used by U.S. airmen but at the time 
there were not many around.

The flight was the first of its kind 
and was fraught with delays due to strong winds which meant it would 
have run out of fuel on its route across the Bay of Biscay and around 
Brittany.

The captain eventually suggested a 
direct route across occupied Europe at night and it took off on 
Valentine's Day even though a message from RAF Transport Command stating
it was against the flight got lost amid conflicting communications.

The plane reached the coast of northern France and registered as hostile on British radar screens.

It was shot down by two spitfires from a Polish Air Force squadron based in Exeter who mistook it for a German Focke-Wulf 200 aircraft and everyone on board was killed, including Griffiss, a brigadier of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, a Navy lieutenant and a Rolls Royce employee.

Following the tragedy it was realised
that fighter pilots needed more training in recognising the differences
between military and civilian aircraft.

It was also a cause of great embarrassment to the Air Ministry and the Air Chief Marshal Charles Portal wrote to Gen Chaney to ease the situation.

He was described as an 'outstanding officer' and the citation on his Distinguished Service Medal said he displayed 'rare judgement and devotion to duty' 
and 'contributed materially to the the successful operation of the 
Special Army Observers Group, London'.

Months after his death the Soviet authorities changed their mind on the supply route Lt Col Townsend had been trying to set up and in the summer of that year it became the main route for U.S. deliveries to Russia.
