'We love offering Australian women the tools to design their own fashion, and are constantly inspired by the creativity and diversity of designs across bikinis, tanks and one-pieces we see coming through,' Ms Aram said. 

Just three years ago - at the peak of her career - Bisk was diagnosed with chronic fatigue which meant she could never fulfill her dream of competing at the Olympics

Just three years ago - at the peak of her career - Bisk was diagnosed with chronic fatigue which meant she could never fulfill her dream of competing at the Olympics.

At the time she had just returned from representing Australia at the Delhi Commonwealth Games and was working towards the London Olympics.

Instead Bisk had to walk away to focus on recovering.

The former elite pole vaulter has attracted a legion of almost 100,000 followers on her Instagram with photos that show off her incredible flexibility.   

Her photos - and their focus on health and fitness - have attracted the attention of fitness-wear label Sport Le Moda. She was named its new ambassador. 

'Amanda's story and dedication to her health really struck a chord with us. One of the key philosophies of Kini Swimwear is about accepting your body with it natural limitations, and celebrate your uniqueness,' said Emily Pinniger, Co-Founder and Creative Director of Kini Swimwear. 

'Amanda is the perfect example of this, rising above adversity by working with her body to create something new and exciting,' she said.
