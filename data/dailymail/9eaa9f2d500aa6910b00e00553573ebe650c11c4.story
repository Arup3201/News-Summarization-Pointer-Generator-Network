Florida has become the latest state to take steps to allow the use of marijuana on prescription, as it's prominent senator Marco Rubio dodged the question of whether he had ever used the drug.

The Republican rising star - who is touted as a potential presidential candidate - declined to say whether he had smoked the herb in a direct question at an education forum.

'If I tell you that I haven't, you won't believe me,' said Mr Rubio. 'And if I tell you that I did, then kids will look up to me and say, "Well, I can smoke marijuana because look how he made it."'

The senator's comments came as Florida's lawmakers introduced identical bills to legalise the use of marijuana for medical purposes.

It is hoped that the proposals will be passed before Florida voters decide on a ballot initiative in November to amend the constitution to allow for the change in the law.

Jeff Clemens and Joe Saunders, both Democrats in Florida's Senate, brought patients and their families to the unveiling of their bill, which would implement by statute the constitutional amendment on the November ballot.

'This bill puts patients before politics,' said Cathy Jordan of Parrish, president of the Florida Cannabis Action Network, who has lived for 28 years with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig Disease.

Mrs Jordan, whose speech is slurred by her illness, sat in her wheelchair next to her husband, Robert, who read her statement at a news conference in front of the Senate building.

The amendment, and the newly introduced legislation, would specify tight state regulation for doctors to prescribe marijuana for treatment of conditions like cancer, HIV/AIDS, ALS and other severe afflictions.

Identically worded bills were introduced in both houses of the state legislature yesterday, in an effort to ease their quick passage.

The session starting March 4 will mark the fourth year such a bill has been introduced. Prominent Florida Republicans, along with Governor Rick Scott and Attorney General Pam Bondi, vigorously oppose a change in the law.

Allowing the medical use of marijuana - a move already taken in 20 states and the District of Columbia - has been seen as a first step to ending the ban on recreational use of marijuana.

Federal law currently classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug, meaning that it regarded as having a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use.

Nevertheless, Colorado and Washington have both voted to legalise the drug for recreational use under state law.

Mr Rubio, one of Florida's two representatives in the U.S. Senate, yesterday insisted that he opposed the legalisation of the recreational use of marijuana.

He said like most teenagers he made dumb decisions when he was younger, and he said he didn't need the help of marijuana or alcohol to further that, the Associated Press reported.

The Florida Supreme Court has already 
approved the ballot language on the amendment and it will become law if 
60 per cent of the voters approve it in November.

Raiding the cupboards for food is a well-known effect of smoking cannabis.

But for years, scientists have been unable to understand why cannabis’ active ingredient, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), causes such a powerful surge in appetite.

Now a European study has revealed that people get ‘the munchies’ after using marijuana because their sense of smell and taste is heightened.

A group of neuroscientists, led by Giovanni Marsicano of the University of Bordeaux, found that in mice, THC fits into receptors in the brain's olfactory bulb.

This dramatically increases the creature’s ability to smell food and leading them to eat more of it, they said in a study published in Nature Neuroscience.

If the findings hold true for humans, it may help develop treatments for appetite disorders by changing the link between smell and appetite.

Polls
 show it has a strong chance of success. If the amendment passes, Mr 
Saunders said the 2015 Legislature will have to pass implementing 
legislation specifying 'how will we grow it, how will people who need it
 get access to it and how will those who are seeking to abuse it receive
 consequences?

While Republican leaders oppose the medical marijuana amendment, a separate bill allowing use of a non-euphoric marijuana extract known as 'Charlotte's Web' is also making progress in the Florida House. The derivative is drawn from a portion of the marijuana plant that does not get users high, but has shown results in treating seizures.

The amendment is seen as a key driver to encourage Democrat voters to turn out at the polls in November.

The petition campaign that put it on the ballot was bankrolled by Orlando attorney John Morgan, a close ally of former Governor Charlie Crist, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for another term as governor.

Mr Crist supports the amendment and political observers expect the referendum will draw more young and minority voters, who tend to vote Democratic.

The earliest recorded use of marijuana dates from the third millennium BC, but since the early 20th Century it's possession, use and sale has been illegal in most countries in the world.

Despite the prohibition and a longstanding 'War on Drugs', the United Nations has said that it is the world's most-used banned drug.
