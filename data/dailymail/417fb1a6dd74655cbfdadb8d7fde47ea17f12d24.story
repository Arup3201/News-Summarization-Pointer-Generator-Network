A homeless man has been crushed to death in a San Francisco elevator shaft where he was sleeping.

The unnamed man was discovered at around 9:30 p.m. Sunday after authorities responded to reports that a rider was stuck in an elevator.

'The rider said he had been riding up to the concourse when he heard a crunching sound, followed by a scream,' transit police Lt. Michael Hayes said. 'Then the elevator stalled.'

Investigators are trying to determine how the unnamed man managed to get inside the Bay Area Rapid Transit station elevator shaft at the bustling Montgomery Street station.

A BART spokesman said there are only two ways to enter - either the ventilation shafts that lead to the elevator shafts, though these have been checked and are apparently secure, or the hatch door in the elevator. To get in through the hatch door, the man would have needed a boost, a spokesman said.

He was found dead on top of the elevator along with personal belongings that apparently included bedding, transit spokeswoman Luna Salaver said.

'We don't understand why anyone would seek refuge in an elevator shaft. It is disturbing, upsetting and highly unusual,' Salaver said. 'This has never happened before in our 40 years of service.'

Authorities suspect the man was homeless, and it was unknown how long he had been inside the elevator, Salaver said.

He had no identification when he was found.

First time: Ticket agents and police, who conduct sweeps for homeless people inside stations prior to closing time, said this had never happened before

Homeless and transient people generally camp overnight outside a station's gate to get away from the elements, Salaver said.

Crews are checking all elevator shafts in downtown San Francisco stations today to ensure there are no other people in danger. The Montgomery station elevator is out of order after the tragic incident.
