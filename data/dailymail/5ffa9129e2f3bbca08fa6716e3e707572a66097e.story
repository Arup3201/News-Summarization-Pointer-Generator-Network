SFO paid Miss Williamson £98,946 for her to travel down and stay in a London hotel for three days a week between 2008 and 2012

Taxpayers paid travel and hotel bills of nearly £100,000 so the CEO of a fraud and corruption watchdog could commute to London from the Lake District, a report reveals today.

Phillippa Williamson, the now-former chief executive officer of the Serious Fraud Office, was also given an ‘irregular’ £407,000 pension top-up that did not go through the proper approval process.

The report, which described the SFO as a case study in ‘how not to run a public body’, found that Miss Williamson was allowed to work from home in the picturesque Lake District.

The SFO paid £98,946 for her to travel down and stay in a London hotel for three days a week between 2008 and 2012.

MPs on the Public Accounts Committee, which produced the report, have condemned the ‘astounding’ working conditions afforded staff at the body.

Three senior staff taking voluntary redundancy were offered severance packages worth £1million without the required approval being sought from the Cabinet Office or the Treasury.

Miss Williamson received a total of £464,905, the chief capability officer Christian Bailes was handed £437,167 and the head of technology Ian McCall received £49,885.

The decisions on pay-outs and redundancies were made by the former director and accounting officer, Richard Alderman. He retired in April last year, four days after Miss Williamson left the SFO.

He was accused of showing a ‘disregard for the proper use of taxpayers’ money’.

Richard Bacon, a Tory MP on the committee, said: ‘The reputation of the Serious Fraud Office has been undermined by a catalogue of errors and poor judgement, and the morale of its staff has suffered as a result.’

The MP said of Mr Alderman that, ‘By 
deciding the size of severance packages, and not seeking alternative 
placements for staff, he failed to follow due process.’ The committee 
particularly criticised the golden goodbyes given the three senior 
staff. Mr McCall’s package included £34,450 to which he was ‘not 
contractually entitled’.

Mr Alderman also decided on a £15,000 special payment each to Miss Williamson and Mr Bailes so as to avoid grievance actions, despite legal advice that there were no such claims to be made.

Miss Williamson had been hand-picked for the role by Mr Alderman, as they had previously been colleagues elsewhere in the civil service. No records were kept on why she was given the job, nor on a subsequent promotion.

The report found that the former director’s actions had taken place in a culture where ‘external advice and scrutiny was to be avoided wherever possible and with an apparent need for secrecy’.

Confidentiality clauses were used in the severance packages.

Labour’s Emily Thornberry, Shadow Attorney General, said that Mr Alderman should be pursued for ‘squandering’ £1million. She called on the Attorney General to charge him with misconduct in public office.

She said: ‘I am pleased that the PAC share my concerns about what has been going on at the SFO and that they have investigated thoroughly.

‘However, it’s still the case that no-one has been held accountable for this or has had to pay anything back.’

In a gruelling session the committee held while compiling the report, it also emerged that Mr Alderman had embarked on 12 foreign trips taking 52 days in his final year.

He visited China, the Philippines and Tanzania while researching the Bribery Act, he told MPs.

Labour MP Austin Mitchell told him at the time: ‘It looks to me, from the outside, like this is an organisation run by lawyers for lawyers and the prolongation of their perks and predilection for easy money.’

After the session, Mr Alderman wrote to the committee acknowledging MPs were ‘justified’ in criticising him and offering his ‘deep and unreserved apology’.
