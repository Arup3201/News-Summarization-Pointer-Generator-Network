Families of victims of the 7/7 London bombings have slammed the BBC for a 'disgusting' documentary that investigates conspiracy theories surrounding the atrocity.

The programme, to be aired on BBC3 and hosted by Irish comedian Andrew Maxwell, probes claims that the co-ordinated blasts were in fact part of a Government plot to boost support for the Iraq war.

The attacks killed 52 people when four suicide bombers detonated their home made devices on Tubes and a bus during the morning rush-hour commute.

'Disgusting': Programme makers even blow up a London bus in the documentary that explores the theory that the 7/7 bombings were in fact a government plot to garner support for the 'war on terror'

In tonight's documentary show producers blow up a double-decker London bus in a bid to recreate the explosion in Tavistock Square that killed 13 people.

It also features conspiracy theorists - including model Layla Randle-Conde - playing the parts of the bombers in a reconstruction of events.

June Taylor, whose daughter Carrie, 
24, died in the underground blast near Aldgate Station told The Sun: 
'The BBC can’t get any lower than this. 
They should have spoken to the families.'

Branding the programme 'disgusting', she added: 'They are trivialising the tragedy. People don’t want to be back in that dark 
place. It puts us through the pain all over again.'

Kim Beer, 54, of Borehamwood, Herts, who lost her son Philip, 22, in the Tube 
blast near King’s Cross said it was in 'really bad taste', adding: 'How do they 
think we live with this?'

A BBC spokeswoman said of 7/7 Bombings: Conspiracy Road Trip: 'The series takes conspiracy theorists on a journey to fully explore the facts and challenge their beliefs.'

Between 8.50am and 9.47am on July 7 2005, four British Muslims - Mohammad Sidique Khan, 30, Shehzad Tanweer, 22, 
Jermaine Lindsay, 19, and Hasib Hussain, 18 - blew themselves up using 
home-made explosives, killing 56 (including themselves) and injuring 700 on three Tube trains 
and a double-decker bus.

They had travelled on a mainline train from Luton into King's Cross 
Thameslink Station in London, each carrying a heavy rucksack of 
explosives.

It is a timeline that has been endorsed by a high-level 
Parliamentary inquiry and a government report, both published in May 
2006 ten months after the event, based on 12,500 statements, a police 
examination of 142 computers and 6,000 hours of CCTV footage.

The report insisted that the bombers carried out the attacks on their own, constructing 
explosives from chapatti flour and hair bleach mixed in the bath at a 
flat in Leeds, Yorkshire, where all four had family and friends.

However there have since been a wave of conspiracy theories around the attacks.

One
 of the more popular accuses then Prime Minister Tony Blair, the 
Government, the police, and the British and Israeli Secret Services of 
murdering the innocent people to stir up anti-Islamic fervour and create
 public support for the 'war on terror' and looming war in Iraq.

Suicide bombers: Four British Muslims - Mohammad Sidique Khan, 30, Shehzad Tanweer, 22, 
Jermaine Lindsay, 19, and Hasib Hussain, 18 - used home-made explosives to carry out the attacks

It also alleges that the four British
 Muslims were tricked by the authorities into taking part in what they 
were told would be a mock anti-terror training exercise.

What they weren't told, it is claimed,
 was that the Government was going to blow them up, along with other 
passengers, then pretend the four were suicide bombers.

Theorists have also accused government agents of setting off pre-planted explosives under the three Tube trains and on the bus.

The aftermath: Theorists have also accused government agents of setting off pre-planted explosives under the three Tube trains and on the bus

They
 suggest that the four Muslims were not, in fact, on any of the Tube 
trains, claiming that they missed them altogether because of the train 
delays on the Luton to London line.

Some
 even believe that because the four did not get onto the Tube on time, 
three of them were murdered by police at Canary Wharf later that morning
 and the fourth - the bus bomber - ran off.

An earlier version of this article carried a headline which said that the documentary suggested that the Government had plotted the 7/7 attacks.  We accept that this was seriously wrong: the true position was, as explained in the article, that the programme actually challenged the beliefs of the conspiracy theorists and did not suggest that the Government was in any way responsible for the attacks.  We apologise for the error.
