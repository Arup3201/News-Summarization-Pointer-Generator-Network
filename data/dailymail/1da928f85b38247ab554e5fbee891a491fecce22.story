Bubble baths, poker cards and a strategically placed exercise balls are some of the only things covering up the brave models of an Ohio rest home, who have stripped down for a good cause.

It was the Pleasant Pointe Assisted Living residents, who are all in their 80s and 90s, who came up with the idea for a charity calendar that showed a little bit of skin.

Teresa Morris, the administrator of the Barberton rest home, said the residents were inspired by a similar calendar another retirement center nearby had done.

Wilma Purvis and Norma Elfrink were the centerfold for the stripped down charity calendar made by residents of the Pleasant Pointe Assisted Living facility in Barberton, Ohio 

'They were so cute about it,' she told the Daily Mail Online. 'It wasn't about shock value, but to be bold and beautiful.' 

Morris said the only thing her mother, who was Miss July, was worried about was getting her hair done before the shoot.  

The calendar features the proud models in a variety of places and poses, often with an appropriate holiday theme.  

Miss February, 87-year-old Dottie Rutter, lies in a bubble bath covered in rose petals as she enjoys a box of chocolates to honor Valentine's Day. 

The 98-year-old Maxine Garden, who  passed away after the shoot, can be seen smiling behind a large exercise ball, happy bare (almost) all in the facility's gym.

The calendar's centerfold is Wilma Purvis, 94, and Norma Elfrink, 91, playing a game of poker with some very large cards - not to mention Coronas and cigars. 

Miss October Jean Genet (right), 90, told Daily Mail Online that she jumped at the chance to be in the calendar when asked.'It's a wonderful thing, to feel young again,' she said

Lifetime Barbertown resident and Miss October Jean Genet, 90, was a housewife before moving into Pleasant Pointe.

She told Daily Mail Online that she jumped at the chance to be in the calendar when asked.

'It's a wonderful thing, to feel young again,' she said.

She said none of the models said no to the shoot in December and that she 'felt glamorous' after taking off her clothes to pose in a witches hat.

Mrs Genet was sad that her husband, who died in November, did not get to see the calendar.

However, she said her whole family, which includes five daughters, 14 grandchilden and 30 great-grandchildren, have picked up copies. 

'They can't believe that's grandma,' she said.

Pleasant Pointe spokesperson Michelle Clapper said the residents were 'very excited' to be a part of the charity calendar, she told the Akron Beacon Journal. 

She said they were 'like 20-year-olds' on the morning of the big shoot, giggling and 'having the time of their lives'. 

'I do not believe the elderly should just sit around staring at each other,' she said. 'I want a fun environment. I love supporting their independence.' 

'I wanted them to decide what they wanted to do,' said Morris. 'That's what we're here for.'  

Proceeds from the calendars, which are selling for $12, will held provide shoes for children who attend schools in the area. 

The residents recently donated $2,000 to the fund. 

Pleasant Pointe says that it has had to order more calendars to keep up with demand, according to WKYC.

None of the residents had ever done any sort of naked modeling before.
