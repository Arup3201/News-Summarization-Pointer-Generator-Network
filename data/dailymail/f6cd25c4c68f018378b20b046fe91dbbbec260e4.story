It took just two days and a small collection of everyday household items for a group of German hackers to bypass the fingerprint sensor on an Apple iPhone 5S.

Chaos Computer Club, based in Berlin, took a high-resolution photograph of a fingerprint from the side of a glass.

They then scanned it, before laser printing it onto a transparent sheet and covering it in woodglue. Once the glue had dried, they peeled off the print copy and pressed it on the scanner.

A fingerprint was photographed using 2400 dpi resolution. The image was inverted and laser printed onto a transparent sheet with a thick toner setting. Hackers then poured woodglue onto the print pattern, pictured top. After it dried, the sheet was lifted and pressed onto the sensor, pictured bottom, to unlock the phone

The fingerprint of the iPhone 5S owner was photographed from a glass surface, using 2400 dpi resolution.

The
 image was cleaned up using photo-editing software, inverted and laser 
printed with 1200 dpi onto transparent sheet with a thick toner setting.

Hackers then poured pink latex milk or white woodglue into the print pattern created by the toner onto the transparent sheet.

After
 it dried, the thin latex sheet is lifted from the sheet, breathed on 
'to make it a tiny bit moist' and pressed onto the sensor to unlock the 
phone.

During the launch, Apple claimed the new iPhone with a fingerprint sensor was 'much more secure than previous fingerprint technology.'

Hackers became so keen to prove the tech giant wrong that a security researcher called Nick DePetrillo even set up an online race to be the first to bypass the technology.

He was offering £10,000, alcohol and other prizes for anyone who could hack Apple's new range of security features.

The German hacker, nicknamed Starbug, said: 'In reality, Apple's sensor has just a higher resolution compared to the
 sensors so far.

'So we only needed to ramp up the resolution of our 
fake'

'As we have said now for more than years, 
fingerprints should not be used to secure anything. You leave them 
everywhere, and it is far too easy to make fake fingers out of lifted 
prints.'

Chaos Computer Club first published the steps taken to bypass fingerprint scanners in 2004 and they claim that it uses everyday household items - meaning anyone can do it. 

The method involves the fingerprint of the iPhone 5S owner being photographed from a surface, such as a glass, using 2400 dpi resolution. 

The image is cleaned up using photo-editing software, inverted and laser printed with 1200 dpi onto transparent sheet with a thick toner setting.

Hackers then pour pink latex milk or white woodglue into the print pattern created by the toner onto the transparent sheet.

After it dries, the thin latex sheet is lifted from the sheet, breathed on 'to make it a tiny bit moist' and pressed onto the sensor to unlock the phone.

Apple's new software has been slammed for causing users to feel sick.

Features
 on software including zooming screens and app windows, full-screen 
slide transitions, a 'faux-3D parallax effect' on the home screen.

As the phone is tilted, the icons appear to move independently from the wallpaper.

Stuff magazine investigated
 the effects these motion-based features had on users and discovered 
claims of nausea, motion sickness and even vertigo.

Frank Rieger, spokesperson of the CCC said: 'We hope that this finally puts to rest the illusions people have about fingerprint biometrics.

'It is plain stupid to use something that you can´t change and that you leave everywhere every day as a security token.

The public should no longer be fooled by the biometrics industry with false security claims. Biometrics is fundamentally a technology designed for oppression and control, not for securing everyday device access.'

Security expert Graham Cluely added: 'It’s worth remembering that fingerprints are not secrets. You literally leave them lying around everywhere you go, and they could be picked up by others.Relying on your fingerprints to secure a device may be okay for casual security – but you shouldn’t depend upon it if you have sensitive data you wish to protect.'
