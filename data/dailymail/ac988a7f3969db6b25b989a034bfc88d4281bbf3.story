A Kuwaiti woman has been arrested in Saudi Arabia for driving her diabetic father to hospital.

The woman was stopped by police near the border with Kuwait and detained before being held in custody pending investigation, according to the Kuwait Times.

It comes a week after a group of women staged a high-profile protest against the ban on female drivers in Saudi Arabia.

Officers were said to be unsympathetic with her when she told them her father was ill and needed to be taken to hospital.

It is not clear whether the womanâ€™s father made it to hospital after her arrest.

At the end of October, a group of Saudi women got behind the wheels of cars in protest at the ban on women holding a licence in the kingdom.

Four women successfully drove, defying the ban, despite warnings from police officers and ultraconservatives in the Arab state.

No specific law exists banning women from driving, but the female population is not issued with licences.

Powerful religious leaders, who exert a far-reaching influence over the monarchy, enforce the ban, warning that breaking it will spread 'licentiousness'.

In the run up to the protest, police warned anyone disturbing public order would be dealt with forcefully.

Ultraconservative clerics staged protests earlier in this week against the online petition campaign, which was launched in September, which claims to have more than 16,000 signatures.

The account's website, oct26driving.org, and official English language YouTube account were hacked on Friday, according to activists.
