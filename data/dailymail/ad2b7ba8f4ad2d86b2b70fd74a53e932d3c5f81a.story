Lassana Diarra has arrived in London for a medical with Queens Park Rangers.

The French midfielder is hoping for a return to the Premier League and would become Harry Redknapp's seventh signing of the summer.

Diarra, 29, was recently sacked by Lokomotiv Moscow and has previous experience of English football with Chelsea, Arsenal and Portsmouth.

The 29-year-old has been in dispute with Lokomotiv coach Leonid Kuchuk and refused to turn up for training.

Sportsmail revealed Rangers' interest earlier this month with the sticking point Diarra's £80,000-a-week salary.

However, he is ready to compromise his demands to push through a deal and link up with Redknapp, who was his boss at Portsmouth.

Diarra left Portsmouth in 2008 to sign for Real Madrid, where he made 87 appearances for the Spanish giants.
