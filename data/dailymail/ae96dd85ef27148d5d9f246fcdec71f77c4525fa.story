A controversial ‘seduction artist’ accused of encouraging violence against women now faces a ban from entering the UK, it emerged last night.

Julien Blanc runs a ‘pick up’ company for men which critics say uses sexually abusive methods to attract women and encourages his clients to treat women badly.

He was expected to come to Britain next week to run a two day seminar, but campaigners have demanded he is blocked from entering.

'Pick-up artist' Julien Blanc has been criticised over his sexually abusive and racist methods

Home Secretary Theresa May – who has a long record of refusing those whose views and behaviour she considers unacceptable, is expected to intervene in the case.

Last week a minister in her department, Liberal Democrat Lynne Featherstone, said she was lobbying Mrs May to refuse Mr Blanc a visa.

Video footage shows the 25-year-old Mr Blanc using racist language and apparently grabbing women by the throat. His other proposed methods include threatening to commit suicide and isolating women from their friends.

One comment posted on his Twitter feed stated: ‘Dear girls, could you please save me the effort and roofie (spike) your own drink? #JustKidding’ .

His website suggests that men who are otherwise not successful at meeting women can ‘shortcircuit’ their target’s ‘emotional and logical mind.’

Miss Featherstone said she was ‘extremely concerned by the sexist and utterly abhorrent statements Julien Blanc has made about women’.

She claimed his appearance in the UK would lead to an increase in sexual harrassment and intimidation of women.

Labour’s shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper has also called for Mr Blanc to be barred.

A YouTube video shows Mr Blanc on the streets of Tokyo grabbing young women and pushing their heads towards his groin. He describes ‘romping through the streets just grabbing girls’.

A blog post describes how to use ‘use coercion and threats’ and ‘emotional abuse’ to control women.

It states: ‘Makes threats to hurt her; make her drop charges; make her do illegal things; threaten to report her to welfare; prevent her from taking a job; take her money and humiliate her.’

He was forced to leave Australia last week when his visa was cancelled. A similar campaign was mounted to bar him from Canada.

A petition calling for him to be refused entry to the UK has received more than 136,000 signatures.

The woman behind the petition, who goes by the pseudonym of Caroline Charles said: ‘Julien Blanc dresses up his seminars as dating advice, which at best is disingenuous - he focuses on tricking women into having sex in order to make money.

‘It is wrong on every level - it is promoting violene against women and girls, it takes advantage of men and it sends a message to survivors of sexual assault that they will not be listened to. To allow someone into the UK who is explicitly promoting these things is abysmal.’

Other commentators have suggested that the campaign against Mr Blanc merely generates him unwarranted publicity.

Blanc’s company, Real Social Dynamics, runs three day courses costing around £1200. His company is due to host a two day course starting on 27th November and another from December 19. Eleven more events are scheduled for next year.

Mrs May can use discretionary powers to ban anyone for reasons of ‘unacceptable behaviour’.

The Home Office refused to comment on the specific case for legal reasons. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘The Home Secretary has the power to exclude an individual if she considers that his or her presence in the UK is not conducive to the public good.’

Mr Blanc’s representatives did not respond to requests for comment.
