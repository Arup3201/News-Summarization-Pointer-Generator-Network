These are the shameful scenes from a 2am brawl involving at least 20 drunken revellers in a town centre.

The fight erupted between two groups of men and women during a Saturday night in Telford, Shropshire.

West Mercia police have released the footage in a new bid to catch those involved.

The footage sees women wearing mini-skirts and high heels using handbags as weapons and even pointing out victims for the men to attack.

Several of the instigators adopt a boxing stance as they throw punches at each other.

Early in the footage a man wearing a yellow t-shirt and dark trousers knocks a man to the floor with a vicious right hook as he is standing with his hands by his sides.

Police described the violence, which took place on May 26 last year, as a 'major disorder'.

Chris Ammonds, a spokesman for West Mercia Police, said: 'This appears to have been a major incident of disorder and we are keen to identify anyone who was involved.

'We will not stand for this type of behaviour in Telford and therefore we are releasing a number of CCTV images today in the hope the public can help us identify some of the individuals shown on the stills.

'We would ask anyone who identifies any of the men captured on the footage to contact us as soon as possible, but it is probably worth noting that we suspect that some of the individuals involved in this disorder were not local to Telford.

'We believe one of the groups involved in this disorder contained men from elsewhere in the Midlands and therefore we would ask people from outside Telford to study these images too.'
