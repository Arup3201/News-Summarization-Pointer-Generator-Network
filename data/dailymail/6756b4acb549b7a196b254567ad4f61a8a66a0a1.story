World Cup posterboy Neymar is leaving everyone playing a guessing game over his fitness ahead of Brazil's last-eight clash with Colombia.

Brazil's number 10 picked up left thigh and right knee injuries in the second-round win on penalties against Chile but coach Luiz Felipe Scolari has declared him fit.

Despite that, Neymar was pictured during Brazil training sporting strapping on his right leg as Scolari led training and his star striker sat on the sidelines alongside him.

However, mystery remains as to how fit he is - and before the session he was seen cycling and laughing with team mate Marcelo, showing no ill effects of the problems he picked up against Chile.

Brazil spokesman Rodrigo Paiva said on Monday: 'The worst is the knee - it's what's hurting the most.'

'He will be evaluated again, but team doctor Jose Luiz Runco said fans don't have to worry because he's not a concern for the match.'

But the strapping on their talisman's leg will still have Brazil fans worried.

And he is still yet to complete a full training session with the rest of the squad as the countdown to the quarter final with Colombia keeps ticking.

While Brazil maintain he will be ready to play in their biggest game so far, it remains to be seen how fit he will be even if he does recover in time.
