John Sheardown, a former Canadian diplomat who sheltered American citizens in Tehran during the Iran hostage crisis of 1979, has died aged 88.

The cool-headed Mr Sheardown played a pivotal role in the so-called Canadian Caper when CIA operatives posed as members of an Irish film production company to rescue US citizens on the run following the Iranian revolution.

The audacious plan was celebrated in last year's film Argo directed by Ben Affleck, however Mr Sheardown did not feature as a character.

Yet so important was his role in the real-life events that his omission from the movie led to accusations that the filmmakers had 'rewritten history'.

After a mob stormed the U.S. Embassy building in Tehran they took 52 Americans hostage in retaliation for Western support for the recently deposed shah. However six Americans managed to evade capture.

All six were taken in by Sheardown at his home in the suburbs north of Tehran. Two then stayed at the home of Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor while the other four remained with the Sheardowns.

Describing the tense situation that lasted for an agonising 72 days, Mr Sheardown said: 'We were under surveillance.

'We had tanks at one end of the street and a fellow that walked up and down. They were always suspicious.'

Kathleen Stafford, one of the Americans described Mr Sheardown as 'a lifesaver'.

To
avoid tipping off the Iranian authorities to the Americans' presence, 
the Sheardowns would buy food from several different stores to disguise 
the amount that was being consumed.

The six fugitives were eventually driven from Sheardown’s home to the airport by an Iranian employee in a Canadian Embassy van. They boarded a Swissair flight and were flown to safety on a plane called 'AARGAU'.

Talking to the Washington Post, historian Robert Wright described Mr. Sheardown as exuding 'the sort of quiet but unyielding resolve that made him a natural leader in a crisis.'

Sheardown was born in Windsor and served as a tail gunner in during the Second World War.

He broke both legs bailing out of a crippled Halifax bomber over Britain, but somehow managed to crawled to a pub and order a drink. He recovered and was soon back flying missions over Germany.

According to his wife, Zena Sheardown, he was suffering from Alzheimer’s disease and died on Dec 30 at a hospital in Ottawa. 

The Iranian hostage crisis was one of America’s darkest hours, in November 1979, Iranian anti-American protesters had shocked the world by storming Tehran’s U.S. embassy and taking 52 Americans hostage. They were to be held for the next 444 days.

But a maverick CIA agent persuaded a desperate U.S. government that the best way of spiriting six trapped diplomats out of the most dangerous place on Earth was to turn the golden rule of espionage operations — Don’t Attract Attention — on its head.

The six — consular chief Bob Anders, agricultural attaché Lee Schatz, and two young couples, Mark and Cora Lijek, and Joe and Kathy Stafford — were split between the homes of the Canadian deputy chief of mission, John Sheardown, and ambassador Ken Taylor.

A month after the embassy take-over, CIA agent Tony Mendez, 38, a veteran of the Vietnam War hatched a bizarre plan in which he would reinvent himself as  Kevin Costa Hawkins, an Irish sci-fi film production manager leading a pre-production team into Iran on a location-scouting mission.

Mendez flew to Los Angeles to enlist John Chambers, the make-up artist who had created Mr Spock’s ears in Star Trek and who won an Oscar for the simian masks he made for 1968’s Planet Of The Apes.

Chambers brought in a special effects colleague, Bob Sidell. The trio took over offices recently vacated by makers of the thriller The China Syndrome and, in four days, set up their own company.

Mischievously calling it Studio Six Productions, they designed business cards for the six trapped diplomats, and invented CVs of former film credits for each of them.

Mendez commissioned a film poster which appeared as a full-page advert in Hollywood trade papers Variety and the Hollywood Reporter. They even threw a small launch party.

Soon, the studio was being inundated with scripts, including one from Steven Spielberg. Hollywood’s finest were taken in — but would the Iranians be so easily convinced?

On January 25, 1980, after the mission had received the personal approval of President Carter, Mendez flew to Iran. Alert to the possibility officials might call to check the story, he left his colleagues manning the phones in LA.

He arrived in Tehran on an early morning flight, knowing the terminal would be quiet, and wasted little time meeting the Canadian ambassador, Ken Taylor, who handed him the six passports his government had made for the Americans.

Mendez, meanwhile, forged the necessary Iranian visas, using the ambassador’s Scotch to moisten his ink pad.

That evening, Mendez met the six and outlined his plan, assigning them roles in the film crew.

‘Being all fairly young, we didn’t really think about the danger we were in,’ Lee Schatz, now 64, tells me. ‘Frankly, we were more worried what would happen to our Canadian hosts if we were caught.’

Did they think the plan totally ludicrous? ‘No,’ says Lee, ‘because Mendez told us to be convincing in these situations, you have to like the idea of who you’re going to be. You have to have some fun. And as Mendez had wryly told us: "Everyone wants to be from Hollywood.”’

Over the next two days, Mendez spent hour after hour drilling his charges, testing them endlessly on their cover stories and getting them used to their new identities.

In the early hours of January 28, they all piled into a van to drive to the airport, suitably disguised. Most had attempted to look as ‘movie industry’ as possible, with oversized sunglasses, eccentric hairstyles and lapels so wide they almost didn’t need a plane.

Bob Anders, the conservative consular chief, had gone the whole hog, dressing in a blue silk shirt two sizes too small and unbuttoned to reveal a hairy chest and gold medallion. He completed the act with a  blow-dried bouffant hairdo and a walk that Mendez remembers as ‘ridiculously mincing’.

At the airport, the six entered the terminal nervously with Mendez. As Revolutionary Guards wandered through the queues harassing other travellers, the group checked in smoothly with Swissair and got through customs.

Mendez recalls the six were really embracing their roles by this point. ‘We were trying to look like we were having a good time. We wanted to be the Hollywood people who didn’t get it — who were out celebrating at the worst time in history. It was part of the cover story.’

Suddenly, disaster loomed. Lee Schatz joined the non-smoking queue for immigration out of habit, while the others stood in the smoking queue.

Separated, he found himself being quizzed by an immigration officer who peered suspiciously at his passport photo and demanded to know if it was really him.

Apparently unconvinced, the officer went into a backroom with the passport. The group froze, but mercifully he returned bringing only a cup of tea. He shrugged at the passport and stamped it. They were almost home and dry.

As the plane — coincidentally named Aargau — left Iranian airspace, bound for Zurich, Mendez gripped the bag he had thankfully never had to open: the one full of Argo posters, relevant Hollywood magazines and even the film storyboards that he might have needed to convince suspicious officials.
