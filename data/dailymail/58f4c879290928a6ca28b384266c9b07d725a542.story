The love story behind these dazzling jewels could have inspired the plot of the much-loved musical The King and I.

The breathtaking necklace, bracelets and ring were given to English teen Ceril Heycock by her husband Prince Bira of Siam as birthday gifts after they wed in 1937.

Many of the pieces the British-educated prince lavished on his young bride are adorned with opals - Ceril's birth stone.

The impressive collection of jewels - which Ceril wore until her death in 2010 - is expected to fetch as much as £60,000 at auction tomorrow.

After their wedding in 1937 Ceril, then 17, and her royal husband - a world-famous racing car driver - moved to Cornwall.

After Bira was given the collection - made up of two brooches, four bracelets, a necklace and a ring adorned with opals, diamonds and pearls - by his cousin Chula, he gave the pieces to his young bride as gifts.

Tradition dictated that Ceril could not dispose of the jewels during Chula's lifetime.

The glamorous couple, who met at art school, divorced in 1949, and Prince Bira went on to marry a further three times.

But the pair are understood to have remained in contact, and the prince is said to have finally reunited with his first true love in 1983.

Ceril wore Bira's gifts throughout her life.

The bond between the Thai prince and the young English woman echoes the plot of the classic musical The King and I.

The acclaimed film, starring Yul Brynner and Deborah Kerr, tells the tale of the unspoken love between the King of Siam and English governess Ann Leonowens.

Siam was renamed Thailand in 1939.

Ceril's family inherited the collection of jewellery upon her death, and the pieces are set to go under the hammer tomorrow.

The pieces, which date back to the late
 19th and early 20th century, are expected to fetch tens of thousands according to auction house Sothebys.

Justin
 Roberts, specialist at Sothebys, said: 'Ceril was an English lady who 
married Bira Prince of Siam in 1937 and they lived in Cornwall during 
the war.

'As he was higher up in the royal hierarchy, Bira’s cousin Chula would give him an allowance regularly.

'Chula
 inherited opal jewels from his mother after her death and he gave them 
to Bira, who then gave them to Ceril as her birthday was in October, of 
which opal is the birthstone.

“Chula
 also gave Bira a loose diamond which he had made into an engagement 
ring, we believe by Cartier in London, and a variety of other jewels as 
was tradition.

“It’s 
unusual to have jewellery with such lovely provenance and what is also 
interesting is that Ceril was not allowed to dispose of them in Chula’s 
lifetime,' Mr Roberts said.

'After Chula 
died Ceril kept hold of the jewels but after her death the
 jewels were passed down through her family, who have now decided to sell
 them.'

Bira was a high profile racing car driver who took part in Formula One and Grand 
Prix competitions.

The Eton and Cambridge University-educated prince won the Monaco Grand Prix just a year before 
marrying Ceril.

He died from heart failure on December 23, 1985, in Barons Court station in west London aged 71.

The auction is due to take place tomorrow.
