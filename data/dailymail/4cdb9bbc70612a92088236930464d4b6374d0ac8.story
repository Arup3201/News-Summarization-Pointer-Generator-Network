As well as driving an XE from London to Berlin for a four-part documentary, he's taken part in a high-octane test at Spa, Belgium, with the help of ex-F1 driver Martin Brundle.

He said: 'My work takes me around the world, but I rarely have the time to get behind the wheel myself.'

Prime Minister David Cameron welcomed Rolls-Royce's official announcement that it's to build its first ever 4x4, creating hundreds of new jobs.

He was present as the firm announced the multi-million pound investment at its Goodwood factory, in West Sussex, on Wednesday and hailed it as a huge vote of confidence in the UK and its economy.

He said: 'The Government will do everything we can to support you because it is something the country needs more of.' The new super-luxury offroader (as imagined by Auto Express above) is set to go into production within three years, adding to a line-up which includes the Phantom and Ghost limousines and variants, plus the Wraith fastback.

It will be a high-bodied allterrain vehicle with all-new aluminium architecture, which Rolls-Royce says is 'worthy of carrying the Spirit of Ecstasy into the future'.

Were it not for a Press leak, this would be a test of the latest version of the Ford Fusion. That was the name planned for the mid-size hatchback, which in 1998 replaced the longrunning Escort. But Ford's then boss, the mercurial Jac Nasser, was so incensed that the cat had got out of the bag, he changed the name and revealed it just seconds before the curtains came up at its Geneva Motor Show launch. Now with 12 million sold worldwide, we're on the third generation.

Ford does so many things without fuss that it's easy to take its cars for granted. A big mistake. The company puts a great deal of attention to detail into each model. So this newcomer is both effortless and nimble to drive, but also engaging, thanks to a crisp six-speed manual gearbox linked to a willing, yet frugal and award-winning, 1-litre 125bhp EcoBoost engine.

The base price of the car I drove was £18,795, but it came with a few extras including Frozen White paint (£250), door edge protectors (£85), but most significantly the Ford Sync2 DAB navigation system (£500) with a big 8in touch-screen with on the central dashboard. It includes a splitscreen display, voice-control of audio, satnav, climate control and mobile phones, spoken street names, 3-D highway, junction and landmark views and even the Michelin guide. A chunk of money, but well worth it.

The ergonomics make it easy to sit in and drive. Buttons tend to be where you want them.

Ford said it's listened to customers who asked for simplicity inside the car with fewer controls and switches to navigate around.

So a sensible de-clutter results in a cleaner, more modern feel to the interior with black satin trim and chrome detailing. Sufficient space in the back. The boot is big enough for the weekly shop.

Good economy at around 60mpg — almost 50mpg in town, helped by stop-start technology. Acceleration from rest to 62 mph is 11 seconds which, while it won't break any speed records, is fine for family motoring. CO2 emissions are low at 108g/km.

My Zetec trim level is the third of six which range from basic Studio to Style, Zetec, Zetec S, Titanium and Titanium X. Standard equipment includes 16 in alloy wheels, a quick-clear heated windscreen, air conditioning, remote central locking, hill-start assist, Thatcham category 1 alarm, halogen headlamps, sports-style front seats and a driver-seat lumbar adjust.

@highlight

Exterior styling has been refined to make it look more streamlined, but the main brief seems to have been, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

@highlight

Up against tough competition such as the Volkswagen Golf which, although more expensive, is a hard act to follow.

@highlight

There are some handy parking aids on offer, which use ultrasonic sensors to locate parking spaces and steer the car into them automatically. Sadly on the model I tested, they were not fitted.

@highlight

Having plumped for a midrange model, you might ask what else is on offer. Beyond the standard Titanium X trim there's the 135mph ST, with its 250 bhp 2-litre EcoBoost petrol engine, which hits showrooms this month from £22,195. There's also a 185 bhp diesel with a top speed of 135mph and 19in alloys, and a high-performance 320 bhp 2.3-litre allwheel drive RS — the 30th vehicle to wear the RS badge since 1968.
