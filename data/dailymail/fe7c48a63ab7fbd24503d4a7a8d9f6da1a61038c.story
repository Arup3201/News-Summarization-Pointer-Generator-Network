A mother who broke almost every bone in her body in a horror car crash has spoken of how her five-month-old daughter miraculously escaped the collision without a scratch.

Lisa-Marie Stoneley, 34, suffered a catalogue of devastating injuries and was left in a coma for eight days after the car in which her family travelled home from a carnival hit another car head on.

But despite being left in a wheelchair and unable to go back to work, Ms Stoneley said that she just wants to focus on the fact that her family all survived.

The mother-of-two, who said she had 'too many broken bones to count', broke both legs, fractured her spine and several ribs, cracked an elbow, shattered her pelvis and ripped cartilage in both knees in the crash on the B3168 at Bay Hill, Somerset in October.

She also suffered a dislocated and fractured ankle, a dislocated toe and swelling on the brain. All but one of her vertebrae were damaged or broken.

Incredibly, Faith, who is now nine months old, escaped the crash unharmed.

Ms Stoneley said that it was a miracle of chance that her baby daughter survived - she is normally strapped into her baby seat on the driver's side of the car but on this occasion had been strapped in on the passenger side.

Securing her in her seat on the other side meant that she missed the impact completely.

Ms Stoneley, from Yeovil, Somerset, said: 'I will never understand why we did it but as a result she missed the whole impact.

'I didn't see Faith for 
five-and-a-half weeks after the accident. I was feeding her myself so 
had only been away from her for about an hour - so to go from that was 
really hard.'

Ms Stoneley's
partner Louis Wood, 36, and son Ryan Roe, 15, also broke their knuckles
in the collision, while Ryan's friend Jamie Steer, 16, severed a major 
artery.

Jamie spent weeks in intensive care and has only recently returned to school.

Ms Stoneley
spent a total of 10 weeks in hospital after the crash four months ago, 
and said it was a 'miracle' her family had survived.

The Stoneley family were on their way back from Ilminster Carnival on October 6 last year when their Vauxhall Corsa (above) collided with a Vauxhall Astra heading in the opposite direction

She said: 'I really think someone was watching over my family that day, it is a miracle we are all still here.

'Faith left the accident without a single scratch and she has been wonderful ever since. Nothing has phased her.

'When
I was first in hospital the doctors told my family there was no 
guarantee I would be okay, given the number of my injuries and the 
nature of them.

'Things weren't looking good at the start but luckily I am quite stubborn so I wasn't giving up that easily.

'I was covered in bandages from all my cuts from the car and I had a plaster cast on my ankle when I was in hospital.

'It sounds strange but at the time I 
didn't realise how serious my injuries were. It is only now when I am in
quite a lot of pain that I think "gosh".'

They were on their way back from 
Ilminster Carnival on October 6 last year when their Vauxhall Corsa 
collided with a Vauxhall Astra heading in the opposite direction.

Lisa-Marie Stoneley said she suffered 'too many broken bones to count'. Here is the extent of her injuries...

Lisa-Marie
had to be cut free from the car by firefighters after being trapped 
inside the car for three hour and rushed to Derriford Hospital in 
Plymouth, Devon.

She was placed on a ventilator after she stopped breathing and doctors were initially doubtful that she would pull through.

She has had three rounds of extensive surgery to fit screws to her pelvis and metal bars inserted in both legs.

Still wheelchair-bound at the moment and awaiting even more surgery, Lisa-Marie hopes that she will be able to walk again.

But she will definitely not be able to return to her job as a healthcare assistant.

She said: 'It's baby steps at the minute.

'It is frustrating as I was very active before. The way I look at it is I could be really angry and really upset but then the only person who would be affected is me.

'I would rather look at it that we got out of it alive. I've got two legs and two feet, and I've got the opportunity to walk again.

'I would rather focus on the positive and get on with my life instead of thinking "what if". We can't change anything, it's already happened.'
