A young British couple feared dead after blizzards and avalanches hit Nepal, killing at least 39 people, have turned up safe and well.

Jade House, from Liphook, Hampshire, and Oliver De Paolis, from London, both 24, contacted their families to say they had been trekking in another part of the Himalayas when the disaster struck.

There had also been concern for British advertising executive Lizi Hamer, 31, and her New Zealand-born wife, Lisa Walton, a former Olympic hockey player.

Jade House and Oliver De Paolis, both 24, messaged families to say they were in different part of the Himalayas when snow storms and avalanches struck yesterday 

Storms claimed the lives of at least 39 people yesterday near to Annapurna, but Miss House and Mr De Paolis were both elsewhere at the time

Ms Hamer, from Loughborough, and Ms Walton, 38, live in Singapore and had arrived in Nepal on Tuesday for a five-day hike. 

But yesterday it emerged they too had been at a safe distance from the Annapurna mountain when appalling weather descended last Wednesday, trapping hundreds of tourists and Nepalese guides. 

Annapurna is the world's tenth-highest mountain and Nepal's most popular trekking area. The trail goes through Dolpa district and can take up to 25 days to complete.

Rescuers have pulled out more than 230 trekkers - most of them foreigners - since rescue efforts began on Wednesday. 

But they are still searching for more survivors, who are believed to be stranded in lodges and huts. Hiking remains difficult because of waist-deep snow. 

An unofficial list online names a number of Britons who are still unaccounted for, but also details some who have been deemed safe after making contact with their families. 

Lizi Hamer, 31, and wife Lisa Walton were also reported to be safe and well yesterday after tragedy

Among those named is 26-year-old Peter Roddis, an engineer from Hove, East Sussex.

Jade House's mother, Angela, 48, said the couple had been taking a round-the-world trip after graduating from Birmingham University last year. 

'I had a WhatsApp message from Jade saying, 'Just to let you know we are fine, far from the weather and avalanche'.'

They were in Malaysia and Thailand before Nepal. 'Family and friends have been calling all day wondering if they're OK. I'm just relieved that they're safe.' 

'Missing': Engineer Peter Roddis, 26, from Hove, East Sussex, is among those Britons still unaccounted for

The remoteness of the region can make it extremely difficult for trekkers to contact home, while others may have taken safe trekking routes but not yet returned. 

The parents of Nigel Vardy, 46, from Belper, Derbyshire, who was also thought to be missing, last night spoke of their relief at hearing he was alive.

It is understood Mr Vardy, who calls himself Mr Frostbite, managed to post a message on Twitter telling them that he was OK.

His mother Maureen said: 'The relief is enormous. Mountaineering is a good hobby for him but not for his mum and dad.'

Experienced: The family of Nigel Vardy, pictured, last night spoke of their relief. Mr Vardy, 46, arrived to climb Himlung Himal in Nepal despite losing parts of his fingers, his nose and all of his toes to frostbite on a 1999 trek

Mr Vardy, an experienced mountain climber, left his home earlier this month to climb Himlung Himal in Nepal.

He continued to climb despite losing parts of his fingers, his nose and all of his toes to frostbite on Mount McKinley in Alaska in 1999. 

His sister Amanda  said: 'The Britons that Nigel was with have all come back safe. We will get full confirmation when people have talked to him - so, good news.' 

Christopher Kneale said he spent days desperately attempting to contact his daughter, Clare Glazebrook, and her husband, Jamie, in the hope they had survived.

Honeymoon: It is thought father-of-three Andy Kimmerling, pictured, was in the area with his wife Suzanne, whom he wed last month

He told the BBC he finally received an email confirming they were safe from the trekking company the couple were travelling with but has still been unable to contact them directly.

Mr Kneale said: 'We've had to go through the trekking company who, I presume, have made contact with the Sherpas out there. It's been tense and horrific - not knowing was the worst.'

Artist Katie Francis, 59, who was trekking with her husband Duncan Hedges, 55, of Malvern, Worcestershire, narrowly avoided being caught in the storms and spent 24 hours helping to treat victims of the avalanche. 

Among those Britons accounted for today is father-of-three Andy Kimmerling, who moved from Cambridge to France 15 years ago.

It was feared that he had gone missing while on honeymoon with his wife Suzanne, whom he wed last month. 

But the 54-year-old's family today confirmed that the qualified mountaineering instructor was safe and had been having trouble with his phone signal.  

Mr Kimmerling, a management consultant, tried to climb Everest last year but had to turn around before he reached the summit. 

Among those who remain unaccounted for is Peter Roddis, 26, from Hove, East Sussex. 

His girlfriend, NHS clinical scientist Lisa Hallet, said she last spoke to him on Wednesday.

She posted online: 'He said he was planning to head out that day or on Thursday, but I have not heard from him since.'

Christopher Pugh and Martin Warner are listed as being from the UK and are also missing. The names of two other British nationals - Katie Hill and Jay Devine - were added to the unofficial list online last night. 

Anxious friends and family of Carole Starr, who is not on the list, said they had not heard from her in five days and feared she was in the area when the storms hit. 

She last contacted her family on Monday when she arrived in Pokhara, a town popular with tourists about to start the trail. 

A Nepalese soldier, pictured left, rescues an avalanche victim buried in the snow after finding him on Sunday

Nepalese soldiers carry the body of a victim of yesterday's blizzard into a helicopter as the death toll rises

Other survivors, suffering from  frostbite, have also made it to safety today as the death toll rose to 39

Among those who have been confirmed dead were Canadians, Indians, Israelis, Slovaks and Poles. 

Fears for the missing climbers grew as nine bodies were spotted yesterday by a rescue helicopter.

The steep terrain made it impossible for it to land, according to Yadav Koirala, from Katmandu's Disaster Management Division, but it was able to rescue three survivors.

The Nepalese government has announced a high-level committee with two senior ministers to monitor and co-ordinate rescue efforts in what looks set to be the country's worst mountaineering tragedy. 

A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office confirmed it is working with local authorities in Nepal to account for every Briton believed to be in the affected area.

She added that embassy staff in the capital, Kathmandu, had not been informed of any British casualties.
