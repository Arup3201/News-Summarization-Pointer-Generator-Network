Princess Beatrice showed she has a royal flair for fashion as she turned up at the Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty exhibition in a black tuxedo gown slashed to the thigh.

The 26-year-old guaranteed all eyes were on her, yet still managed to appear elegant as she flashed some leg on her way into the venue. 

The slender princess inadvertently brought back memories of the 2012 Oscars, when pictures of Angelina Jolie 'legbombing' went viral on the internet.

Princess Beatrice flashed some thing as she made her way up the steps of the V&A museum in Lodnon, where the opening of the Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty exhibition is being held tonight

The princess accessorised her black dress with a sequinned butterfly hair-clip, a diamante bracelet and gold box clutch, along with a pair of black stiletto court shoes. 

Her make-up channeled a Fifties Hollywood star, with a smokey eye and a bright red matt lipstick.  

Beatrice is one of the most fashion-conscious members of the royal family and is frequently seen attending events with some of the UK's biggest IT girls.

She is firm friends with the supermodel Kate Moss, who is also at the event this evening and is one of the stars of the party, with her 3D holographic image taking pride of place.

The Alexander McQueen label is all about standing out from the crowd and doing things differently, with this tuxedo dress being a prime example of the brand's classic with a twist style.

In fact, when the late Lee McQueen was at the helm of the design house he became renowned for the statement clothes and controversial themes evident in his collections. Since Sarah Burton has taken over the label, she's continued to pay homage to this ethos.

So if you're wearing McQueen eveningwear, you better get ready to make a statement, which is exactly what Princess Beatrice has done in this frock which features a thigh-high split, as well as a tuxedo design front that gives an androgynous spin to the look.

The 'borrowed from the boys' trend is a go-to favorite of style icons like Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne and has a undeniably chic outcome. So if you fancy getting in on the action too, just get shopping our edit of tuxedo dresses below!

The princess appeared delighted to be at the exhibition of the late designer 

Beatrice's thing-baring gown served as a reminder of the 'legbomb' that Angelina Jolie did at the 2012 Oscars 

 The new Savage Beauty retrospective that will be the largest retrospective of the late Alexander McQueen's work hosted by the museum, with more than 200 different pieces set to go on show. 

 Among the pieces included are gowns from his 1992 postgraduate collection, as well as some of his A/W10 designs - the last the designer would ever create.

His final collection was never completed, with just 16 dresses shown to fashion editors in Paris a month after he died in February, 2010. 

But while McQueen might be gone, his brand lives on and, in the capable hands of his former assistant Sarah Burton, continues to go from strength to strength.

Jamie Hince and Kate Moss also attended the exhibition 

David and Victoria Beckham were also invited to the event

Sarah Burton said: 'Lee was a genius and a true visionary who pushed boundaries, challenged and inspired,' she explains. 'He believed in creativity and innovation and his talent was limitless. 

'Savage Beauty is a celebration of the most imaginative and talented designer of our time.'

'I am thrilled to announce that the V&A will bring this wonderful exhibition to London to celebrate the extraordinary creative talent of one of the most innovative designers of recent times,' adds V&A director Martin Roth.

'Lee Alexander McQueen was brought up in London, studied here and based his globally successful McQueen fashion brand here – by staging the exhibition at the V&A it feels like we are bringing his work home.' 

Other guests in attendance at the event this evening include Annabelle Neilson, Jamie Hince, Naomi Campbell, Erin O'Connor, Laura Carmichael, Colin Firth and  Salma Hayek.
