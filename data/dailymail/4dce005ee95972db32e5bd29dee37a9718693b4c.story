Striking a pose and smiling happily at the camera, these photos are similar to hundreds of thousand of snaps which are posted by young people on Instagram everyday.

But the marked difference is the subjects are wearing the Israeli Defence Forces' uniform representing a country that is currently engaged in a deadly battle with Gaza. 

This week's deadly exchange of rockets and airstrikes between between the two enemies has seen lives lost on both sides, but these relaxed snaps, posted on Twitter, do not betray the turmoil.

Strike a pose: These photos happy are similar to hundreds of thousands which are posted by young people on Instagram everyday... except for the guns and uniform

Girls in action: This photo reads: 'Northern boundary of the state of Israel.' Women make up almost one-third of the force, and 50 per cent of its officers, making the Isreale Defence Forces one of the most gender-equal units in the world

Support: A girl does a thumbs up pose with the hastag '"#istandwithisrael #IDF"'

The snaps are accompanied by supportive hashtags.

One girl relaxing in the sun in her uniform wrote: 'Out in the sun, in the dust of the war, one nation standing stronger than before.'

Two boys smiling with weapons slung casually over their shoulders have the accompanying line: 'We're coming for you gaza!'

The young men and women are
part of Israel's compulsory military service which is compulsory for 
most Israelis over the age of 18, with men serving three years and women
two.

Fun in the sun: The poster of this photo wrote: 'Out in the sun, in the dust of the war, one nation standing stronger than before'

Arty shot: The girl on the left posed with a handbag in a lift while she takes a photo while the boy in the snap on the right, wrote: "#israel #army #soldier #USA'

Happy: These two girls pout and smile for a photo with the hashtags reading '#idf #israel #army #soldier #life'

Women make up almost one-third of the force, and 50 per cent of its 
officers, making the Israeli Defence Forces one of the most gender-equal
units in the world.

Today the Israeli army started calling up 16,000 reservists, as officials said the Jewish state was preparing for a possible ground offensive into the Gaza Strip.

'They're distributing emergency call-up notices now, the process has started,'  said an army spokeswoman.

'As part of Operation Pillar of 
Defence, the IDF (army) will begin recruiting 16,000 reservists,' the 
military said on its official Twitter feed.

Time for a close up: The post with this photo reads: 'Army time..#army #solider #uniform #idf'

Smiles all round: A group of young recruits gather in a circle for a photo. Military service is compulsory for most Israelis over the age of 18, with men serving three years and women two

Israeli
Defence Minister Ehud Barak on Thursday approved the call-up of 30,000 
reserve soldiers, who can be drafted into action by the military at any 
point, the army's official spokesman said.

The move came as Israel pressed a 
relentless air campaign against Gaza militants which looked increasingly
likely to expand into a ground operation after a rocket struck the sea 
just off the coast of Tel Aviv and a second landed to the south of the 
sprawling coastal city.

'We are in the process of expanding the 
campaign,' the military's chief spokesman, Brigadier General Yoav 
Mordechai, told Channel 2 television on Thursday.

Loyalty: Although the person who took this photo is not visible, they showed their allegiance to their country by putting their uniform on their bed and writing 'Ready to defend my country'

Declaration: 'Ready for war' was the accompanying caption with this photo

Group connection: Under this photo the person who posted it online wrote 'Family'

'The defence minister approved ... based
on the army's request, the recruitment of another 30,000 soldiers. We 
will determine how many of them will be called in,' he said.

'This means that all options are on the table.'

Senior cabinet minister Moshe Yaalon 
also warned that Israel was considering a ground operation in order to 
stamp out rocket fire.

'We are preparing all the military 
options, including the possibility that forces will be ready to enter 
Gaza in the event that the firing doesn't stop,' he wrote in a series of
postings on his official Twitter account.
