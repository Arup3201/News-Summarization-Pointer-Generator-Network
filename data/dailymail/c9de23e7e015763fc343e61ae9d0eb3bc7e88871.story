A callous thief posing as a Good Samaritan stole a motorbike from its owner as he lay seriously injured in the road after a crash.

Glenn Hawkins, 35, was left with a broken collar bone, punctured lung and two cracked ribs after coming off his £8,000 Kawasaki ZX-6R on a city centre road.

Seconds later, a passer-by pretended to lend him a hand by moving his green-and-black sports bike, which still had the keys in the ignition.

Despicable: Glenn Hawkins had his motorbike stolen by a passerby posing as a Good Samaritan as he lay seriously injured in Bond Street, Bristol, (above) after a crash

But instead of helping, the crook roared off with the powerful 600cc machine as his victim lay stricken in the road.

Speaking from his hospital bed, construction manager Glenn said: 'I was pretty annoyed and that’s putting it lightly.

'If I had got hold of him, he would have ended up in the hospital bed next to me. Now I just want to get my bike back.

'If anyone sees it, or the thief who stole it, I would really appreciate it if they called the police as soon as possible.'

Glenn, from Redland, Bristol, was on the way to get his motorbike serviced last Wednesday when a cyclist stepped out in front of him.

The crash, at 10.30am on Bristol’s Bond Street near the city’s Cabot Circus shopping centre, sent him flying off his bike and sprawling into the road.

When dazed Glenn looked around, he was stunned to be told his bike had been nicked by a man described as being stocky, black and wearing a black and white hooded top.

The crash victim had only bought the bike - known as a ‘Ninja’ - one month ago and describes it as 'my baby'.

Glenn said: 'I came off my bike and skidded along the road. When I got up I said ‘where’s my bike?’ and I was told someone had stolen it. '

He was forced to spend five days at Bristol Royal Infirmary, including his birthday, and is expected to miss another fortnight of work while he recovers.

As well as the broken bones, Glenn had to have four stitches in his left leg and suffered painful friction burns.

The cyclist escaped uninjured, but was shaken up by the ordeal.

Glenn, who has ridden bikes since he was a teenager, said: 'I might need physio and more treatment - so I don’t know when I’ll be able to ride a motorbike again.'

Avon and Somerset Police confirmed they were hunting the suspect and the motorbike.

A spokesman said: 'While Mr Hawkins was being treated, someone offered to help move his motorcycle out of the way and then rode off on it in the direction of Portland Square.

'Despite an extensive search of the area by local response officers, the stolen motorbike was not located.

'Other inquiries, including the examination of CCTV, are underway to identify the person responsible and return the bike to the owner.'
