A Connecticut man convicted of killing a mother and her two daughters in a 2007 home invasion said the crime got out of control and that he felt so remorseful he was suicidal, a psychiatrist testified today during the sentencing phase.

Dr Richard Dudley Jr testified that Joshua Komisarjevsky told him the situation became increasingly out of control but he didn’t know what to do.

'He explained that the victims certainly didn’t have to die,' Dr Dudley said. 'He talked about how bad he felt about that. And he talked about how at the end of it all how suicidal he was.'

Guilty: The jury convicted Joshua Komisarjevsky last month on all 17 counts in the home invasion - including capital felony, murder and sexual assault

Prosecutors have questioned Komisarjevsky’s remorse, noting he blamed the sole survivor, Dr William Petit, for not doing more to help his family even though he was beaten with a bat and tied up. In his taped confession to police, Komisarjevsky spoke matter-of-factly and laughed occasionally.

Dr Dudley said he did not believe Komisarjevsky’s views about Petit were inconsistent with remorse.

He said those feelings were more related to believing he was not protected as a child from sexual abuse he suffered by his foster brother.

The jury will decide whether Komisarjevsky gets the death penalty or life in prison.

Komisarjevsky and co-defendant Steven Hayes were convicted of capital felony, murder and sexual assault in the killings of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters at their Cheshire home.

Hayes is on death row after he was convicted last year of raping and strangling Hawke-Petit and killing her daughters, who died of smoke inhalation after they were tied to their beds and left to die in a fire.

Komisarjevsky portrayed himself as reluctant to commit the burglary with Hayes because in the past he always acted alone and didn’t know Hayes well. But he also described the thrill he got from home invasions, Dr Dudley said.

Prosecutor Michael Dearington reminded jurors that Komisarjevsky targeted the Petit house and sexually abused Petit’s 11-year-old daughter. He pressed Dr Dudley on whether the crime was motivated not only by money but also by sexual assault.

'I think the possibilities are open,' Dr Dudley said.

Komisarjevsky’s nine-year-old daughter is scheduled to testify by videotape on Wednesday as the defence tries to convince the jury to spare him the death penalty. The girl was interviewed earlier by a child psychologist and the defence is expected to play about 20 minutes of her nearly hour-long interview.

Dr Dudley testified that Komisarjevsky is 'extremely attached' to his daughter.

'He saw her response to him as just kind of unconditional acceptance,' Dr Dudley said.

Under cross examination, Dr Dudley said Komisarjevsky only spent weeks with his daughter before he was charged with the home invasion. He had been in prison earlier for a string of residential burglaries.

Dr Dudley testified on Monday that Komisarjevsky has suffered from a mood disorder since he was a child that includes periods of profound depression. He also said Komisarjevsky, who was adopted, has a family history of mental illness.

Mr Dearington pressed Dr Dudley on why he relied on an anonymous letter about the family’s history. Dr Dudley said his diagnosis was based on his own evaluation of Komisarjevsky and that the letter was consistent with his findings.

At least 10 per cent of the population suffers from mood disorders, Dr Dudley said.

He concluded that Komisarjevsky's judgement was impaired by his mental condition, but that it was not a direct cause of the crime.

Meanwhile, Komisarjevsky's tearful mother, Jude Komisarjevsky, told the jury today her son is shocked at his role in the crime and she blames it on sexual abuse he suffered as a child.

'He was just in shock that he was involved in something like this,' she told the court. 'He was asking how did this happen, how did I get to this point? He eventually got to the point, I can't retrace the steps. So he's just trying to see what he can salvage for himself.'

The defence says Komisarjevsky was sexually abused between the ages of four to six by a foster teen his family had taken into the home.

'I think we basically feel that we wished we had said no to being foster parents, because we don't think we'd be here today,' Jude Komisarjevsky said, crying.

Jude Komisarjevsky, who testified at the beginning of the sentencing phase, was called to take the stand again today, and testified about bringing her granddaughter to see Komisarjevsky in prison when he was sentenced for earlier home burglaries.

The defence showed jurors a photo of Komisarjevsky with his daughter during one visit as his mother described how she would sit on his lap as he read her stories.

Jurors also saw photos of Komisarjevsky with his arm around his daughter opening a Christmas present. One daughter smiled as she viewed the photos.

Jude Komisarjevsky recalled her son putting his daughter to bed the night of the crime.

'He talked about her, how sweet and precious she was,' his mother said. 'I had a sense he felt things were not good and this was like a goodbye.'

The defence is expected to rest next Tuesday. The sentencing phase began October 25.
