An online campaign to expose Nigel Farage’s ‘less pleasant and stranger utterances’ is needed to tackle the threat UKIP poses to the Tories, Andy Coulson has warned.

The former Number 10 spin chief sounds the alarm about Tory ‘vulnerability’ to UKIP and warns his old boss David Cameron that more needs to be done to woo voters who have flocked to Mr Farage.

UKIP has become a club of ‘disgruntled’ ex-Tories who are ‘fed up’ with Mr Cameron’s leadership, Mr Coulson claims.

Setting out a blueprint for seeing off the threat posed by Mr Farage’s anti-EU party, Mr Coulson calls for a video compilation of the UKIP leader to be posted online.

A £120billion blackhole in UKIP’s spending plans should also be exposed to more scrutiny.

But Mr Coulson warns in an article in GQ magazine that with UKIP expected to win next year’s European Parliament elections, Mr Farage will have a right to demand a place on TV leaders’ debates ahead of the general election.

It is the latest intervention from Mr Coulson, who quit as Downing Street director of communications in January 2011.

He is now facing trial over allegations related to conspiracy to hack phones and conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office.

Branding the UKIP leader ‘Mr Mirage’, Mr Coulson urges the Tories to compile a blooper reel of Mr Farage’s ‘less pleasant and stranger utterances’ which could be posted on YouTube.

The misdemeanours of UKIP MEPs in Brussels should also become front page news if the Tories are to reverse the perception that Mr Farage’s leads an anti-politics party.

Appeal: Mr Farage has managed to attracted 'disgruntled' Tories fed up with David Cameron's leadership, Mr Coulson claims

Tory analysis suggests there is a £120billion blackhole in UKIP’s policies which ‘must be hung around [Mr Farage’s] neck’.

However, the former editor of the News of the World  warns against a repeat of Mr Cameron’s 2006 claim that UKIP members as ‘a bunch of fruit cakes and loonies and closet racists’.

The slur was repeated in the days before the local elections this year, when Tory minister Ken Clarke said he had ‘met people who satisfy both those descriptions in UKIP’.

After a furious backlash, UKIP went on to take one in four votes in elections to councils across England.

Mr Coulson says the Conservative strategy to tackle UKIP has been ‘misplaced for years’ with the Tory leadership being ‘dismissive, arrogant and downright rude’.

Mr Coulson adds: ‘As a result UKIP has become a club for disgruntled, invariably older Tories fed up with the leadership’s attitude mostly, although not entirely, towards Europe.

‘More dangerously it allowed the party to present itself as the natural home for anyone fed up with mainstream politics.’

Increasing pressure on the Tories, Mr Farage has threatened to go to court to secure a place on TV leaders’ debates before the general election. Mr Coulson says the UKIP leader may have a ‘bit of a point’.

He argues: ‘The Conservatives should meet the UKIP debating challenge sooner and have Farage boxed off long before the first TV debate.

‘It should be led by a senior Cabinet member, not the PM . ... Hague, as Foreign Secretary, is perfectly placed for some net practice on Farage’s preferred playing surface of Europe.’

Battle: Mr Coulson argues the UKIP leader will have a claim to taking party in 2015 general election TV debates, if his party tops the polls in May next year

Mr Coulson adds: ‘Europe will, of course, continue to be the drum that UKIP bangs the loudest.

‘The Conservatives’ post election in/out referendum promise took the wind out of UKIP sails but more work will need to be done as next year’s European elections approach.

‘On that issue, I’m in no doubt, William Hague is already burning the midnight oil.’
