Criticism: NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson has said that hospitals are 'very bad places' for elderly people

Hospitals are ‘very bad places’ for elderly people, according to the head of the NHS.

Sir David Nicholson said they were not the right place to care for ‘old, frail people’, and called for community care to be expanded to accommodate the growing elderly population.

He compared modern treatment of the elderly to the ‘national scandals’ of the Sixties and Seventies caused by treating mental health patients in large asylums.

‘If you think about the average general hospital now, something like 40 per cent of the patients will have some form of dementia,’ Sir David told The Independent.

‘They [hospitals] are very bad places for old, frail people. We need to find alternatives.’

He added: ‘The nature of our patients is changing – and changing rapidly. You are getting a larger and larger group of frail, elderly patients who are confused.’

Sir David, who is currently the NHS’s chief executive, was speaking for the first time since his appointment as head of the Health Service’s Commissioning Board.

The new body will take over responsibility for all NHS services in England from the Department of Health in April.

His warning comes after a series of scandals involving substandard care of the elderly, including at Stafford Hospital, where up to 1,200 patients may have died unnecessarily.

He said: ‘I would compare it with where we got to with the big asylums. If you remember what happened in the 1960s and 1970s, there was a whole series of national scandals about care of mentally ill patients.

‘The response was not just to say that the nurses who looked after these patients needed to be more caring, but actually there was something about the way we treated these patients and the model of care that needed to change.’

Sir David’s plans to revolutionise elderly care, particularly for dementia patients, include treating common conditions locally and using funds to keep patients out of hospital.

Creating community-based treatment centres, managing long-term conditions and preventing falls would be key to future care of the elderly, he said.

Such expansion of community services could lead to hospital closures, with services concentrated in larger, specialist centres.

In December, Prince Charles spoke about the ‘crisis in caring’ in Britain, warning that modern medicine and technology were putting the ‘human touch’ at risk.

He said he was ‘sure that there is much more that can be done to foster and enhance those age-old qualities of human kindness and compassion’.

Weeks earlier, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt had said there was a ‘kind of normalisation of cruelty’ in the worst hospitals.

Sir David – who will be in charge of an annual budget of £93billion, but seek more than £20billion of savings – said the Commissioning Board would not be afraid to challenge ministers over financing.

He said it would also tell the public how much money the NHS needs to achieve goals such as keeping waiting lists down and improving life expectancy.

‘We will be saying, “If that’s the amount of money which is available, these are the sorts of things we will be able to deliver and these are the sorts of things that we can’t”,’ he said.

‘That’s a big change. We will be saying, “If you do this, this is what we think the implications will be”.’
