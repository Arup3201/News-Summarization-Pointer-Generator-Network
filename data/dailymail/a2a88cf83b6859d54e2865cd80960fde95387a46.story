The ceremony took place in front of 26,000 people at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park with the iconic Olympic stadium as the backdrop.

Prince Harry was also in attendance for the final event of the Games that saw wounded servicemen and women competing for medals. More than 400 competitors from 13 countries have taken part in the games.

It seems the Prince, who turns 30 tomorrow, was in particularly high spirits as he joined rock band the Foo Fighters on stage to celebrate his achievement in organising the Games.

He also commented that he would be enjoying a celebratory beer tonight with the British Armed Forces team captain, double-amputee Dave Henson, as both men turn 30 tomorrow.

Also in attendance was Princess Eugenie with her boyfriend businessman Dave Clark. The Princess wore a hoodie and green jacket, accessorised with an unusual present-shaped ring while her boyfriend opted for a grey jumper.

Both appeared to be enjoying the event, laughing to each other during the evening.

Prince Harry was most recently linked with former beauty pageant winner Camilla Thurlow – staying with her on a luxury yacht, three months after he split from Cressida Bonas but the pair were both seen last month at the Wilderness Festival in Oxfordshire where Miss Bonas danced within metres of her ex-boyfriend.
