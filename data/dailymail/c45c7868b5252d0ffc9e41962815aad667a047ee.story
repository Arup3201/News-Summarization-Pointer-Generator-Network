These stunning caves and their intricate patterns are a real work of art.

Artist Ra Paulette has spent the last decade excavating tunnels and passageways, and carving designs and benches in the sandstone cliffs in northern New Mexico.

Each cathedral-like room takes him years to complete and is a masterwork that was created without the use of machines.

Each room has its own unique design with patterns that were carved by hand

Holes carved into walls or ceilings fill the rooms with natural light 

Calling it his final and most ambitious project, the 68-year-old's art caves are decorated with unique patterns as holes carved into the walls or ceilings fill rooms with natural light.

Some rooms look like comfortable living areas, with benches that Ra crafted by hand using small tools.

After chipping away at the walls, he carries rocks and dirt out of the cave by hand.

Ra launched the laborious project ten years ago when he grew tired of artistic differences with patrons and gave up on commissions.

He is now the subject of a documentary directed and produced by Jeffrey Karoff.

Ra explains on his website: ‘Manual labour is the foundation of my self-expression. To do it well, to do it beautifully is a “whole-person” activity, engaging mental and emotional strengths as well as physical strength.'

He added: ‘When digging and excavating the caves I break down all the movements into their simplest parts and reassemble them into the most efficient patterns and strategies that will accomplish the task while maintaining bodily ease.

'Like a dancer, I “feel” the body and its movement in a conscious way.

‘I’m fond of calling this “the dance of digging”, and it is the secret of how this old man can get so much done.’
