At the vanguard of the new order of younger players, the 23-year-old said he was happy with his start but the windy conditions on the outside courts were challenging.

'It was a good start for me. Of course, I expected it to be tricky,' he said.

'I think it was just a little tough for everyone to get into that rhythm, to get used to the court. It was pretty windy today.'
