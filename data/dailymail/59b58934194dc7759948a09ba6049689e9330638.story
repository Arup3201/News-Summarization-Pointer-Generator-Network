CERN's Large Hadron Collider will be restarted in March after a £97 million upgrade that could help solve some of the universe’s greatest remaining mysteries. 

The world's biggest particle collider, located near Geneva in Switzerland, has been undergoing a two-year refit. 

Its two proton beams — each with a diameter less than a third that of a human hair — will now contain energy equivalent to the detonation of 154 tons of TNT.

Upgrade: The LHC's computer screens are dark, but behind the scenes, work  gave the vast machine a mighty upgrade, which will enable the collider to advance the frontiers of knowledge even farther

It was shut down in February 2013, and will be turned back on in March 2015 - at double power, scientists revealed. 

Experts believe that the souped-up power  will allow them to explore aspects of high-energy physics — such as dark matter, the suspected existence of new fundamental particles and gravity.

It may even be possible to produce microscopic black holes.

In 2012, a less powerful version of the collider confirmed existence of the Higgs boson particle, 'the God particle' which explains how fundamental matter took on the mass to form stars and planets. 

It led to worldwide fame for Peter Higgs, an emeritus professor of physics at Edinburgh university, who first suggested it existed and shed tears as he was awarded the Nobel prize for physics. 

That discovery was a landmark in physics but there are still plenty of other mysteries to be unraveled, including the nature of 'dark matter' and 'dark energy'.

New frontier: When experiments resume in 2015, scientists at CERN will use its enhanced power to probe dark matter, dark energy and supersymmetry

Scientists: A year ago, the world's largest particle collider made one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science, identifying what is believed to be the Higgs Boson -- the long-sought maker of mass

Work is now 'in full swing' to start circulating proton beams again in March, with the first collisions due by May, the European Organization for Nuclear Research said. 

'With this new energy level, the (collider) will open new horizons for physics and for future discoveries,' CERN Director General Rolf Heuer said in a statement.

'I'm looking forward to seeing what nature has in store for us.'

CERN's collider is buried in a 27-km (17-mile) tunnel straddling the Franco-Swiss border at the foot of the Jura mountains. 

The entire machine is already almost cooled to 1.9 degrees above absolute zero in preparation for the next three-year run. 

The old machine had several drawbacks. However, there are many other unsolved questions that could now be answered.

DARK MATTER  

Mysterious dark matter is one of the greatest mysteries in modern astrophysics. It cannot be seen directly with telescopes; and it does not emit or absorb light. The total mass–energy of the known universe contains 4.9 per cent ordinary matter and 27 per cent dark matter and 68.3 per cent dark energy. Experts believe that the souped up power of the collider will allow them to make dark matter. 

 

HIGGS BOSON

The existence of the Higgs boson was put forward in the 1960s to explain why the tiny particles that make up atoms have mass. Theory has it that as the universe cooled after the Big Bang, an invisible force known as the Higgs field formed. This field permeates the cosmos and is made up of countless numbers of tiny particles – or Higgs bosons. As other particles pass through it, they pick up mass. In 2012, a less powerful version of the collider confirmed existence of the Higgs boson particle, which explains how fundamental matter took on the mass to form stars and planets.

 

ANTI MATTER - Antimatter is material composed of antiparticles, which have the same mass as particles of ordinary matter but have opposite charge and other particle properties such as lepton and baryon number, quantum spin, etc. There should be as much anti matter as matter but it has disappeared. Now scientists hope that the LHC could locate it. 

Energy: The LHC's particle collisions transform energy into mass, the goal being to find fundamental particles in the sub-atomic debris that help us to understand the universe

As engineers focus on the technical mission, physicists are sifting through data that the mighty atom smasher has churned out since 2010 

These include the relative lack of antimatter in the universe, when equal amounts of matter and antimatter were created in the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago, and the possible existence of other new kinds of particles.

Tara Shears, a physics professor at the University of Liverpool said: 'We have unfinished business with understanding the universe.' Shears works on one of the four main experiments at the collider. 

CERN's work can baffle non-scientists, but researchers want to find ways to make it simple to understand the work done by the large Hadron collider.

The new collider uses magnets to accelerate subatomic particles called protons to near light speed.

Each proton has similar energy to that of a small fly, but each bunch contains 115 billion protons and has as much energy as a 330 pound motorbike travelling at over 90 mph.

There are 22,208 bunches in each beam and two beams travel in opposite directions through the tunnel and have the equivalent energy of the Eurostar train at maximum speed. 

Scientists aim to smash the beams together inside detectors to recreate conditions similar to the conditions existing after billionths of a second after the Big Bang. 

The latest Large Hadron Collider (LHC) replaced the Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP), which ran from 1989 to 2000. It came online in 2008, but ran into problems, forcing a year-long refit.
