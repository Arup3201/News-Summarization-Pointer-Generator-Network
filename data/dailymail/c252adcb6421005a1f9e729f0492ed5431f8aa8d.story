Ed Balls today ambushed George Osborne on live TV by forcing him to agree to take part in a head-to-head election debate on the economy.

The Tories had tried to argue that they would not discuss the idea of a clash between the would-be Chancellors until the leaders' debate had been resolved - which seems unlikely.

But appearing together on BBC One, Mr Balls forced Mr Osborne to shake on the deal, raising the prospect that it could be the only televised election debate between the two parties before polling day.

Mr Balls insisted Prime Minister David Cameron may be 'scared' of a one-on-one debate with Labour leader Ed Miliband but he was up for the showdown with Mr Osborne.

After he was put on the spot, the Chancellor shook Mr Balls's hand but suggested Danny Alexander, Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury, should be included.

Speaking on BBC One's the Andrew Marr Show, Mr Osborne said he was sure an election debate between the different finance spokesmen of the parties would take place.

Asked if he was keen on the debate, shadow chancellor Mr Balls replied: 'Of course, and I would like to go further. George and I don't need the broadcasters to sort these things out.

Mr Osborne tried to claim that his Lib Dem deputy Danny Alexander should be included as well

'George is not a coward. David Cameron doesn't want a head-to-head with Ed Miliband but I'm very happy - I will have a head-to-head debate, just the two of us, the potential chancellors during the election campaign.

Addressing Mr Osborne, he said: 'You can say now - are you up for it?'

The Chancellor replied: 'As I say, happy to have these chancellors' debate, just as we did in the last election.'

Mr Balls extended his hand out to Mr Osborne to shake on a one-on-one debate, telling the Chancellor: 'Come on George, let's go for it.'

Mr Osborne appeared hesitant, saying he would be happy to meet Mr Balls in a debate.

He shook the shadow chancellor's hand, adding to Mr Balls: 'We're going to see who else wants to be part of it. I have got a very effective Chief Secretary who I think would also want to be part of that debate.'

Mr Balls added: 'If only David Cameron was up for a one-to-one debate like George, it would be alright - for some reason David Cameron is running scared.'

Mr Osborne said: 'I think we should include Danny Alexander.'

Mr Balls countered: 'No, one-to-one. We just shook on it.' 

Speaking on BBC 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics, Mr Balls said he was unsure if Mr Osborne had agreed to the debate or not.

He said: 'He started shaking hands and he was agreeing to a head-to-head debate with me. By the end of the handshake it sounded like he wanted to bring along his deputy Danny Alexander.

'It was clear and then it was unclear. I thought George Osborne was going to do what David Cameron has ducked for weeks and weeks.

'He started the handshake doing it - by the end, constructive ambiguity I think.' 

Labour's Ed Balls squirmed today as he repeatedly refused to rule out entering a power-sharing deal with the SNP.

A surge in support for the Scottish Nationalists looks set to deprive Labour of a majority and leave Nicola Sturgeon's MPs holding the balance of power.

Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg today vowed never to enter coalition with a party which wanted to break up the union.

But Mr Balls refused to match the promise, despite being challenged as many as 12 times during a TV interview.

He would only say that Labour has 'no plans, no need, no desire' for a pact with the SNP.

Challenged on BBC One's Andrew Marr show, Mr Balls said parties who ignore the need to tackle the country's deficit are 'completely wrong' and 'irresponsible'.

But his opposition to the SNP did not stretch to categorically ruling out sitting in Cabinet with them.

Told by Mr Marr to say the words "I rule it out", Mr Balls replied: "Ed Miliband said it's nonsense. It's not part of our plans.

'You know Andrew, you've been covering politics for 30 years, parties, large parties at this stage say we're fighting for a majority and we are.

'I'm not going to get involved in speculation about post-election deals.

'We're fighting for a majority.'
