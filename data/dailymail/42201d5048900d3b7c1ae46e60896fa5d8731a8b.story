Prince William is said to be nervous about Thursday's investiture ceremony

Prince William is set to step up as a senior royal this week when he hosts his first investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace.

William will represent the Queen during the hour-long event on Thursday, when he will hand out medals to luminaries – including an OBE to British tennis star Andrew Murray – and dub new knights with a sword.

The 31-year-old prince has told aides he is ‘a bit nervous’ about the service, when dozens of recipients will be honoured.

A royal insider said: ‘William has been practising using the sword and pinning the medals on a servant so that he gets it right.

‘He obviously doesn’t want to slice anyone’s ear off or stick a pin into their chest.

‘Above all he realises this is the biggest day in the lives of some people who are being honoured, and he wants it to go well for them.’

The source added: ‘His biggest challenge is being tall – it’s not easy to stoop down and talk to some of the smaller recipients and to pin the honours on.’

Last month Kensington Palace announced that the second in line to the throne was to leave his full-time job as an RAF search-and-rescue pilot in order to take on a greater royal role.

The prince was immediately criticised, however, for suggesting that he would not significantly increase the number of official duties he does each year - which stands at just 40 or so, compared to more than 300 conducted by his grandmother – in favour of a ‘transitional year’, learning more about the way the monarchy works.

Although he has represented the Queen on official visits abroad, Thursday’s investiture will be the most significant role he has carried out her behalf to date – and is one he will regularly conduct when he is king.

It is not clear why the Queen has asked her grandson to go as she has no official engagements in her diary on that date.

But it is known that the 87-year-old monarch finds standing for up to an hour at a time, leaning forwards to pin on the medals and wielding her heavy sword, rather tiring and a great strain on her back.

‘The Prince was always going to start doing more royal duties but he wants to add them in slowly and do each one well without rushing into things,’ said a source yesterday.

Around 25 investitures are held every year, mostly at Buckingham Palace, but also at Windsor Castle and Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh.

As well as the Queen, they are sometimes performed by Prince Charles and, on rare occasions, Princess Anne.

At the start of the ceremony William will enter the Ballroom attended by two Gurkha orderly officers, a tradition begun by Queen Victoria in 1876.

Having served in the Army, Royal Navy and RAF, William will have a choice of uniform, but Prince Charles normally wears a Royal Navy outfit.

Also on duty will be members of the Queen’s Body Guard of the Yeoman of the Guard, created by Henry VII in 1485.

Music will be provided by a military band or an orchestra from the Purcell School of Music.

After the national anthem has been played, either the Lord Chamberlain or a Lord in Waiting will announce the name of each recipient and their achievement.

William will then award them the decoration before congratulating them, shaking their hand and having a brief chat.

Those who receive a knighthood kneel on the investiture stool and are dubbed on the shoulder by the royal using a sword which belonged to the Queen’s father George VI.

As well as Andy Murray, other notables taking part on Thursday include Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Christopher Allison, National Olympic Security Co-ordinator for London 2012, and comedy producer Jon Plowman.

In October last year Her Majesty pulled out of an investiture at Windsor Castle with a bad back and Prince Charles had to fly down from Scotland to hand out 90 honours.

The Queen has suffered from sciatica, which causes lower back pain and numbness in the legs, as well as knee problems that required surgery.

She stands for the entire hour during every investiture, and two years ago the dais in the Waterloo Chamber at Windsor Castle was lowered by a few inches so that she didn’t have to stoop down so far to pin medals on.

‘It is quite a strenuous exercise to hand out the medals without mistakes, engage people in conversation and to keep bending down,’ said an insider.

‘The Queen has done it without complaint for years but she is now 87, and she will be delighted that William is stepping up to support her by taking on some of her duties.’

A Buckingham Palace spokesman declined to comment, saying details of royals taking part in investitures were never announced until the day.
