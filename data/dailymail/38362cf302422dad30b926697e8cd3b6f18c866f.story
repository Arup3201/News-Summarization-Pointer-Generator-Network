The world stopped the moment President John F. Kennedy was assassinated and the vision of him slumping against the first lady in their open top vehicle in Dallas has been seared into the nation's memory.

Now, 50 years on, the some 800,000 letters of condolence sent to his widow will form the basis of a TLC network movie.

'Letters to Jackie: Remembering President Kennedy' will air this fall, half a century since Kennedy's killing on November 22, 1963.

The film revisits the aftermath of the assassination to examine the former first lady's role in helping the nation through its grief as she suffered through her own.

In mourning: Americans expressed their sorrow over the loss of a great man

Twenty celebrities will read the letters, including Zooey Deschanel, Kirsten Dunst, Anne Hathaway, Mark Ruffalo, Betty White and Michelle Williams.

The heart-wrenching sentiments of ordinary Americans, often riddled with grammatical errors, are teamed with never-before-seen home movies and photographs of the Kennedy family.

'Dear Mrs Kennedy, You & your family have our sorrow of the death of your husband, not only because he tried to help us as Negro but all so he was human,' Mrs. Frank Borders of Shelby, North Caroline wrote.

'We loved your husband because he thought Negroes was Gods love and made us like he did white people and did not make us as dogs. Mrs. Kennedy we are praying for you and your family.'

Meanwhile, Janis Hirsch of Trenton, New Jersey, offered some advice.

'Dear Mrs. Kennedy, I am only thirteen and I know you are well educated, but I still feel I could give you some advice. I have been operated on four times for polio and I am now recuperating from a broken hip, but I know you have problems too, so I'll tell you my remedy for smiling and happiness. Always sing "You Gotta Have Heart" from "Damn Yankee's" and I think you'll be happy.'

According to The Washington Post, some 45,000 cards, letters and telegrams arrived within three days of the shooting. Within seven weeks 800,000 had been received. Thousands more arrived arrived after that.

The stunned citizens poured their hearts out to the first lady about the man many of them felt they knew.

Anniversary: The film comes 50 years after Kennedy, pictured here with Queen Elizabeth II, was killed

'I have grown up without a father. Last year the head man on my list, my grandfather, passed away. Since then your husband was the man I looked up to. I feel that I knew him,' confided student Nancy Ashburn of Beacon, New York, according to The Post.

'As I write this letter I burst into tears, over the loss of a great man. His memory will last forever. Thank you for listening. P.S. I wish they would let me get my hands on the assassinator.'

Gabriele Gidion, a German-born Jew who settled in New York, described never having felt such a sense of loss as she did when JFK was killed.

She wrote in her heart-wrenching letter: 'Dear Mrs. Kennedy: Twenty-six years of: escaping from Hitler — growing up in wartime China fleeing from Communism — watching my father's futile struggle against cancer — seeing my roommate killed in an automobile accident — all these I deemed adequate preparation for some of life's bitter moments. Yet NEVER, until last Friday, have I felt such a desperate sense of loss and loneliness.'
