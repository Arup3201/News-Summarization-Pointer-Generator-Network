A US drone strike has killed the terrorist behind the Westgate shopping mall attack which left 67 people dead in Kenya's capital Nairobi.

Adan Garar and two others are suspected to have been killed after their car was targeted near the town of Bardhere in Somalia.

Senior US and Kenyan officials say Garar, a top member of the al-Shabab extremist group, was thought to have helped plan the devastating attack on the Westgate mall in 2013.

A Kenyan official, who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorised to give the information to the media, says Garar is also suspected of planning failed attacks on Kenya's coast and in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, last year. 

The U.S official also insisted on anonymity.

Anti-terror police foiled a planned attack in the coastal city of Mombasa after they intercepted a car packed with explosives in March 2014, according to Kenyan authorities. 

According to police, al-Shabab militants had planned simultaneous attacks on the international airport in Mombasa, the ferry crossing and a supermarket. 

Deadly: 67 people were killed in the Westgate attack, which was carried out by four gunmen from al-Shabab

The car laden with explosives was to be detonated on a ferry.

Al-Shabab, an Islamic extremist group, has vowed to inflict violent attacks on Kenya and Uganda because the two countries have contributed troops to the African Union force supporting the government in Somalia.

Sixty-seven people were killed in the Westgate attack, which was carried out by four gunmen from al-Shabab.
