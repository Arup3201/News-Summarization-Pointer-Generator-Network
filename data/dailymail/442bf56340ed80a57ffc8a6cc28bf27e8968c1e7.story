A Health Department employee of 38 years has been suspended for answering customer calls in a voice that sounds so much 'like a robot' he's confused customers into thinking he's an automated recording.

Ronald Dillon is accused of talking in a 'deliberately robotic fashion' at least five times between February and April of 2013, representatives for the Health Department said during a disciplinary hearing.

He's now been suspended  for 20 days.

Department of robots?: Ronald Dillon was suspended from working at the Department of Health because he 'spoke like a robot' on customer service calls and even convinced them he was an automated recording

Dillon's boss at the agency's IT help desk apparently repeatedly told Dillon to stop using the robot voice after fielding complaints from callers, Administrative Law Judge Kara Miller was told.

One customer hung up on Dillon then spoke with another employee and told her there was a new automated answering system. 

She said she had hung up when she heard 'the robot' answer the phone because she needed to speak to a human about her registration issues. 

At the hearing, the Heath Department played the recording of Dillon's robotic sounding and extremely enunciated reading.

'You have reached the Help Desk. This is Mr. Dillon. How may I help you?' said the recording.

Dillon was originally sentenced to 34 days suspension but his penalty was lowered to 20 days after he gave the judge his reasoning.

Dillon defended his voice saying he was merely trying to enunciate clearly because he has a thick Brooklyn accent, reports DNA info.

Ronald didn't admit to trying to sound like a robot but he did say he isn't much of a people person and that working in customer service is a glitch in the department's employment system.

He added that his boss, Barry Novack, picked on him and that he was simply trying to please him by eliminating his accent over the phone.

'They objected to the tone of my voice so I made it atonal,' he said.

Judge Miller lowered his suspension after his explanation but said Dillon is a 'disgruntled' employee who doesn't like his boss.

Boss' orders!: Ronald Dillon argued he wasn't speaking like a robot but that he was trying to speak slowly because he has a Brooklyn accent and can be difficult to understand 

'There is a difference between speaking slowly and distinctly and speaking so robotically that callers did not believe that they were speaking to a person,' she wrote in her decision.

Dillon has worked for the Health Department since 1976 and has never had any prior disciplinary problems.

Dillon's job at the department has dwindled over the years and he wasn't so pleased with his new responsibility answering tech questions from the public about NYCMED, a web portal allowing healthcare providers to register with the Health Department.

'He appears to be [a] disgruntled employee who is acting out because of the restructuring that has occurred within the department over the last few years,' she wrote.

Dillon served as a project manager and a supervisor for many years before being drafted to the customer service desk.

Dillon told the judge he didn't have any background in customer service.

'It's a bullying-in-the-workplace issue,' he said.

He asked his supervisors to transfer to another agency unit but they said no.

'It's an experience. Not one that I would want people to go through, but it's an experience,' he said of working the phone line.
