Controversial comments: Jockey Ruby Walsh, pictured Tuesday, said 'you can replace a horse' after race death

A star jockey prompted outrage yesterday by playing down the death of a horse during a big race.

After spectators and TV viewers watched in horror as Our Conor suffered a fatal fall at the Cheltenham Festival, Ruby Walsh said the animal was replaceable.

The 34-year-old Irishman said: ‘Horses are horses. You can replace a horse’.

The comments by Walsh, who has twice won the Grand National, provoked a furious response from animal rights campaigners. They described his words as callous and lacking respect for the horse.

Mr Walsh, who reached a record 40 wins at the Festival after a double-victory yesterday, added: ‘It’s sad, but horses are animals, outside your back door. Humans are humans. They are inside your back door.

‘You can replace a horse. You can’t replace a human being. That’s my feeling on it.’

The comments sparked fury from animal rights campaigners and are likely to reignite the debate over whether horse-racing is an unnecessarily cruel sport.

Campaign group Animal Aid said that Mr Walsh had ‘no respect’ for the animals that have brought him success.

Horse-racing consultant Dene Stansall said: ‘He has shown callousness for the animals that have earned him a good living.

‘It’s completely disrespectful. To treat the death of a horse in such a way shows that they are merely machines for people to make money.

‘Ruby Walsh is the leading jockey at Cheltenham and wants to support the event as much as he can, but you cannot disregard the lives of horses just because they are not humans.

‘We would expect more from him. This shows he has got little empathy for a horse that really suffered before it died.’

Tragedy: Our Conor, right ridden by jockey Daniel Mullins, suffered a fatal fall during The Festival Champion Day at Cheltenham Racecourse on Tuesday

Our Conor fell as he ran in the main race of the day, the Champion Hurdle. The five-year-old, which is thought to have been sold for one million euros last year, slammed into the ground as he contested the lead with Captain Cee Bee at a furious pace.

Screens were put around the horse as he was treated by vets, but officials later announced that he had been put down.

They said: ‘Our Conor was attended by vets immediately and they did everything possible to save him. After extensive treatment for a back injury, the decision was made to humanely put the horse down.’

Campaigners have complained about the Festival and claimed the race-course is the most lethal in the country.

According to Animal Aid, 48 horses have lost their lives there since March 2007, with 15 deaths at the Festival. In 2012, five horses died in just two days.

They say the Festival puts horses under enormous pressure due to its big and noisy crowds and also warn that many of the races feature too many horses, making it difficult for the animals to judge their jumps.

'Lacking respect': Ruby Walsh, seen after taking a record sixth Mares' Hurdle title at the Cheltenham Festival on Tuesday, was attacked by animal rights activists

Last night the British Horseracing Association said: ‘The welfare of the sport’s equine and human participants is paramount to British Horseracing and remains the over-riding priority for all those involved with the staging of the Cheltenham Festival.

‘Cheltenham Racecourse employs eight veterinary surgeons, whose sole responsibility it is to provide care to the horses throughout their time at the racecourse.

‘In the event of an incident on the racecourse any horse affected will receive immediate attention and treatment from the racecourse’s veterinary team.

‘Qualified paramedics and doctors are also on hand in the case of any incident involving a jockey.

‘If necessary, horses and riders will be transported from the course to receive further treatment at the most appropriate equine hospital or Accident & Emergency hospital.

‘British Racing is open and transparent about the risks involved in the sport - the BHA Veterinary team monitors injury rates at every licensed racecourse. Over the last 15 years the equine fatality rate has fallen by one third to 0.2% of all runners.

‘Despite the best efforts of all involved, as with participation in any sport involving speed and athleticism, there remains an inherent risk of injury.’

It said that campaign groups such as Animal Aid are not welfare organisations, but ‘extremists’.

Mr Walsh, from Kildare in the Republic of Ireland, yesterday led Vautour to victory in the opening race of the Festival, romping home with six lengths clear.

He later scored a second win on Quevega in the OLBG Mares’ Hurdle Race.

The jockey won the Gold Cup on Kauto Star at the Festival in 2007 and 2009.
