Adelaide mother, Danni McLean, discovered the blade while preparing a meal for her daughter

An Adelaide mother discovered a two-centimetre razor-sharp metal shard in a packet of organic baby food she was about to feed the nine-month-old daughter.

Danni McLean was emptying a packet of Woolworths' Organic Baby Macro food to feed to her daughter Willow, when the food started leaking out of a cut towards the bottom of the packet.

Ms McLean said she felt around the cut, and discovered the two-centimetre blade covered in baby food.

Ms McLean said she contacted the supermarket, and then took to Facebook to warn others about the potentially deadly discovery.

Her post has gone viral since being uploaded on Thursday, with over 5,000 shares in two days.

'Let me start by saying Woolworths is acting on this matter urgently however recalling a product of the shelves takes too long and I need to relieve myself of this burden in keeping it secret and make sure other mothers are aware ASAP,' Ms McLean wrote on the social media website.

She was shocked to discover the two centimetre long blade when it cut through the opposite end of the sachet on Thursday

Danni McLean found the shard of metal in a Woolworths' Organic Baby Macro meal which she was preparing for her nine-month-old daughter Willow

'Do not buy macro baby food at the moment as the photos below show you what I found in Willows food yesterday!

'That sharp object covered in oily grease is a blade about 2 cm long. As I was squeezing the food into a bowl yesterday I felt something in my hands and was all the food coming out from the other end along with a blade! #thisisnotorganic.'

Photos taken by the Ms McLean, show the blade protruding out of the bottom of the pouch of Organic Tomato Chicken with Pasta Puree, having pierced the base of the sachet.

After notifying Woolworths and receiving no reply in 24 hours, she took to social media to warn other mothers from buying the product

Later that day she reported that a Woolworths representative arrived at her home to collect the blade and packet for testing.

Woolworths has since issued a recall for the nationally sold product.

However they have only recalled the singular batch of Tomato Chicken and Pasta flavour, offering a full refund to its customers.

A Woolworths spokesman said: 'We would like to sincerely apologise to the customer for not keepingher informed about the investigation after she contacted us on Wednesday.

'We are fully investigating this incident. All Macro baby food in this type of packaging is x-rayed before leaving the manufacturer and after discussion with them we are confident in ruling that out as a source.

'Our initial investigation shows the product was not spoilt which indicated the blade entered the packaging not long before the customer found it.

'We will continue our investigation to get to the bottom of it but we think this is an isolated incident.

'As a precautionary measure we withdrew the product from shelves immediately after being informed by the customer.'
