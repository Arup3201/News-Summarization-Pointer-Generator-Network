Missing: Arthur Neal Jr, 86, was last seen at his home on Trinity street in Detroit, Michigan, on December 20

The family of an elderly man who disappeared in the middle of the night just days after he won $20,000 on the lottery say they fear for his life.

Arthur Neal Jr, 86, was last seen at his home on Trinity street in Detroit, Michigan, on December 20. He was driving a black, 1998, Cadillac Deville, with a Michigan plate of BMZ -7786.

The African American grandfather is 5ft 7 inches tall and weighs 160 pounds with a medium complexion, gray hair, and a full beard and mustache. 

Neal's worried granddaughter, Lawanda Marshall, said they had become concerned after he failed to show up for Christmas, as he would not have missed Christmas with his family.  

According to his relatives, Neal  had recently won  $20,000 in a lottery game, but had no plans to leave town.

Marshall said that the information about his lottery win was widely publicized and his family think this could be the reason he has vanished into thin air.

Marshall said: 'It bothers me greatly because I don't think that's the type of information that should have seeped out – if that was the case – especially that neighborhood in which he was staying and reside.' 

Neal's family said they went to his house to check on him and found his home in disarray and a door left ajar which raised their suspicions  further.

Vehicle: Neal was last seen driving a black, 1998, Cadillac Deville, similar to this white model, with a Michigan plate of BMZ -7786

His family said that he still does masonry work despite his age.

They are appealing to anyone with information to report it to police.

Anyone with information should contact Detroit Police on (313) 596-5640.
