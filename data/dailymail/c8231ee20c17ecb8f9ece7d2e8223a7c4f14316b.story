A widow locked in a 10-year legal battle with a Texas hospital to have her husband's heart returned says the organ she was given could be from an animal.

When Linda Carswell's husband, Jerry, died unexpectedly after being treated for kidney stones in 2004, his heart was removed and kept without the family's permission.

The remains were finally released by St Joseph Medical Center but when Mrs Carswell had them tested independently the results were disturbing.

Questions: Linda Carswell has filed a petition to ask why the organ the hospital claims is heart tissue from her husband, Jerry, was found to have no human DNA when she had it tested by an independent laboratory

Grief: Linda, pictured with husband Jerry, wanted his heart returned so she could fully lay her husband to rest

When scientists at NMS Labs, a forensic laboratory in Pennsylvania, examined the heart they could find no trace of human DNA.

According to a biologist, the missing human DNA could be a result of how the heart had been preserved, or a 'real possibility that the heart submitted was not human'.

The lab analysis also questioned what the tissue had been preserved in, stating it 'didn't smell like formaldehyde'.

The shocking results mean Mrs Carswell is still unable to fully lay her husband to rest. She told ProPublica she feared burying the unknown organ tissue could 'desecrate the grave'.

Mrs Carswell told Mail Online: 'The hospitals and their pathologists continuously have represented to the courts and to us that it was Jerry's heart, that it was properly preserved, and that DNA testing would confirm it was his heart.'

Shocked: Linda Carswell, pictured with Jerry and their granddaughter, says she was horrified to learn that no human DNA could be found in the heart tissue

She added that after the long legal battle following her husband's death, the family thought nothing could surprise them.

'Now we are more than surprised - we are shocked and horrified,' she said. adding: 'As much as we would like to put this behind us, now we find it necessary to go back to court.'

The family's attorney, Neil McCabe, said they had approached the court to ask for depositions of relevant representatives of the hospitals and pathologists, to get answers about why the materials that they claimed was Mr Carswell's heart were found to be devoid of human DNA.

'Whether or not our inquiries will lead to further legal action must await the court's decision on our request for depositions and what those depositions reveal,' he told Mail Online.

Unexpected: Jerry Carswell was being treated for kidney stones when he unexpectedly died at Christus St Catherine Hospital in Texas

Autopsy: When the retired teacher's body was examined at St Joseph Medical Center, part of the heart was removed and kept

For the family, the results mean they
 are still lacking closure in the unexpected death of Mr Carswell, who 
died shortly after being given drugs on the day he was due to leave 
Christus St Catherine Hospital in Katy, Texas.

The retired teacher had been admitted to hospital for kidney stone treatment.

His
 widow successfully sued the hospital for $2 million for fraud over an 
independent autopsy she had requested to see if the drugs had played a 
role in her husband's death.

The autopsy didn't determine a cause for death and did not include the drugs test the family had requested.

The hospital was cleared of causing the father-of-two's death by negligence.

A
 court of appeals upheld the lawsuit verdict, but the hospital is asking
 for the case to be heard again. It declined to comment on the DNA 
testing of the heart.

Two years after her husband's death, Mrs Carswell also discovered that the St Joseph medical center that carried out the autopsy had kept part of her husband's heart.

The hospital argued that it needed the tissue for possible evidence in the legal battle, but finally an appeals court ordered that it be returned to the family.

Erin Lunceford, an attorney for the medical center, told ProPublica she didn't know why the heart had no human DNA.

Closure: The ongoing legal battle and DNA test results have been hard for Linda, who is mourning the loss of Jerry, who died in 2004

She said the hospital was now under new ownership and the heart was only under the current owner's possession.

Mrs Carswell, who has filed a petition to be able to question the hospital about the DNA results, said the analysis 'really hurts me'.

'I felt it was right to get Jerry’s heart returned to us, to our family, so we could bury the heart and get it out of their hands,' she said. 'I couldn’t think of just leaving Jerry’s heart.'--
