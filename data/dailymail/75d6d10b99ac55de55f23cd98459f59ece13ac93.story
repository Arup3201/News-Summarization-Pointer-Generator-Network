Police turned a blind eye to  allegations of sexual abuse of white girls by gangs of largely Pakistani men for more than a decade, it was claimed yesterday.

Research, reports and case files also revealed that council officials were desperate to cover up any racial link to the abuse of young girls.

The research shows that a string of warnings dating back as far as 2000 were ignored by the authorities. In many cases, police action was taken only against the victims.

Confidential documents have revealed the scale of sexual exploitation of young white girls in Rotherham, South Yorkshire

Among the alleged crimes for which no one was prosecuted were:

South Yorkshire Police headquarters in Sheffield where details of the problem of sexual exploitation are revealed in internal reports prepared by the force

According to previously confidential 
documents seen by The Times, police in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, found
 evidence of thousands of similar crimes and described ‘networks of 
Asian males exploiting young white females’.

The groups were reported to have trafficked victims to cities including Bristol, Manchester and Birmingham.

Despite this, just two prosecutions of groups of men for sexual abuse have taken place in South Yorkshire since 1996.

The revelations about sexual exploitation in Rotherham echo the activities of a street-grooming gang which preyed on dozens of young girls in Rochdale, Greater Manchester.

Nine members of the group, including ringleader Shabir Ahmed, 59, were jailed for a total of 77 years by a judge at Liverpool Crown Court in May.

An 11-week trial heard that the men would target vulnerable teenage girls and pass them around for sex.

If the girls did not submit, they were plied with cheap vodka and raped.

It emerged during the trial that police and social services had missed opportunities to stop the abuse.

Ahmed, pictured above, was jailed for 19 years for his role in the street-grooming ring.

In August he was given a separate 22-year prison term, to run concurrently with the first, after he was convicted of raping another child in his community.

Earlier this month, Rochdale Borough Safeguarding Children Board announced that a serious case review into the exploitation would be held.

The board's chairman Lynne Jones told the BBC that the review would look at the experiences of four young people and how agencies responded to their needs.

The review would focus on what help was available to the girls in the early stages of their ordeal and how reports of concern about the victims were handled.

In 2002, Home Office-funded research 
criticised officers for treating young victims as ‘deviant and 
promiscuous’ while ‘the men they were found with were never questioned 
or investigated’.

Revealing the fears over the racial 
element to the abuse, a 2010 report from the Rotherham Safeguarding 
Children Board said the crimes had ‘cultural characteristics ... which 
are locally sensitive in terms of diversity’, but warned of 
‘sensitivities of ethnicity with potential to endanger the harmony of 
community relationships’.

Denis MacShane, MP for Rotherham, 
said: ‘There’s a culture here of denial and cover-up and a refusal to 
accept the reality that we have men living in the Rotherham community 
who treat young girls as objects for their sexual pleasure. It’s time to
 tell the truth. We must root out this evil.’

The
 revelations come only three months after it emerged that social 
services in Rotherham had known for six years that a teenage mother, 
murdered for bringing shame on the families of two men who had used her 
for sex, was at clear risk from predatory gangs.

Laura
 Wilson, 17, had been groomed by a string of men before she was stabbed 
and thrown into a canal to die for informing her abusers' families of 
the sexual relationships.

Her
 killer Ashtiaq Asghar, who was 18 at the time, was given a life 
sentence and will serve a minimum of 17-and-a-half years after he 
pleaded guilty to murdering Laura in October 2010.

But
 it emerged in June that Rotherham Council's social services were well 
aware she was at risk and had received information about certain adults 
suspected of targeting her from the age of 11.

A
 serious case review report confirmed that Laura had dealings with 15 
agencies and identified 'numerous missed opportunities' to protect her.

It stated that she eventually became 'almost invisible' to care professional.

Rotherham Council's Cabinet member for services for children, young people and families, Councillor Paul Lakin, said: 'There is no question that we will do whatever we can to protect our young people from harm in whatever form that threat takes.

'The Council has already acknowledged publicly that there have been lessons learnt from previous work, cases and investigations and that the support offered to a small number of vulnerable young people has not always reached the high standards we always look to provide.

'From that learning, improvements have been made and new services introduced and those developments will continue.

'Following the recommendations from a serious case review, inspections and our own learning on other cases, the sexual exploitation team has recently evolved from the original youth serviceproject into the new multi-agency service to improve preventative and support work along with boosting efforts to investigate cases and bring people to justice.

'We are also maintaining our major investment in protecting children at a time when public sector budgets are under increasing pressure.

Eight men who gave young girls small change and cuddly toys in exchange for sex were jailed yesterday.

The predators, who picked up victims aged between 13 and 15 from care homes and the streets, slept with them for as little as £5. Others received cigarettes and ‘treats’, including toys.

Anthony Lambert, 51, Stefan Godfrey, 44, John Shaw, 55, Ijaz Ahmed, 35, Mark Adaoui, 40, Colin Simpson, 55, David Shardlow, 56, and Ian Yeoman, 60, were jailed for a total of 41 years and seven months at Derby Crown Court for a series of sex offences.

'We have pledged our commitment by prioritising the amount of money being put into safeguarding services along with prevention and early help work with families to help ensure they get the support they need.

'Sexual predators do come from different sections of the community and are criminals who need to be brought to justice regardless of their background.

'We have worked closely with communities and community leaders across Rotherham in recent years to enlist their support in helping to tackle some of these issues and to educate people about sexual exploitation.

'The response has been very positive and our commitment to continue to tackle this issue is shared by local agencies and our communities.'

A South Yorkshire Police spokesman 
said any suggestion that it ‘and its partners have been reluctant to 
tackle child sexual abuse is wrong’. He added that safeguarding children
 was not just about prosecuting individuals.
