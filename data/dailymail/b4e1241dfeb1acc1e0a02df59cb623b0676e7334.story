Motorists can breathe a sigh of relief, as soaring gasoline prices are now in the rear-view mirror thanks to a sharp drop in the value of crude oil.

For the first time in months, retail gasoline prices have fallen below $3 a gallon in places, including parts of Michigan, Missouri and Texas.

The national average for regular unleaded gasoline is a more-comfortable $3.51 per gallon, down from a high of $3.98 in early May.

Economists caution that gasoline savings, while welcome, won't matter much to people if the worst economic fears come to pass.
