Two white ex-Milwaukee police officers have been given $300 fines for their roles in a sordid string of illegal anal cavity probes inflicted on male suspects, all of whom were black.

Six months after ringleader Michael Vagnini was sentenced to just 26 months in prison for the crimes, Jeffrey Dollhopf and Brian Kozelek were given the small fine and ordered to perform 100 hours and 20 hours respectively of community service.

Both officers pleaded no contest to disorderly conduct as a party to the crime in October and quit the police department in early December as part of a plea agreement.

The pair were facing a maximum sentence of 90 days in jail but their attorneys stressed that neither were ever charged with ordering or conducting the strip searches. They were, however, present when the grim probes took place.

According to the Journal Sentinel, 
prosecutors said in the proceedings that the two men should have acted 
to stop Vagnini, who been sentenced to just over two years in 
prison.

Vagnini, who is also white, pleaded no 
contest to four felonies and four misdemeanors for inflicting 
abhorrently invasive cavity searches on dozens of male drug suspects.

A
 fourth officer, Jacob Knight, took a plea deal in which he agreed to 
resign from the department and was sentenced in October to 20 days in 
jail, 60 hours of community service and a $300 fine.

According
 to The Journal Sentinel, one victim said that an officer put a gun
 to his head while Vagnini administered a choke hold, touched his 
scrotum and put his fingers in his anus. Another man was probed so 
violently that he bled, a court heard.

Wisconsin
 law clearly prohibits police officers from administering cavity 
searches. Only medical professionals may do so, and only when authorized
 by a warrant.

But Vagnini 
even conducted the illegal search a 15-year-old boy, touching his anus 
and genitals during a traffic stop in December of 2011. The JS 
documented at least a dozen similar instances of Vagnini performing 
invasive, illegal searches on black men.

Two years: Ringleader Michael Vagnini, pictured center in June, pleaded no contest to four felonies and four misdemeanors for inflicting abhorrently invasive cavity searches on dozens of male drug suspects. he received two years in prison

The assaults happened over two years, according to a criminal complaint.

The
 victims, identified only by their initials, told prosecutors the 
officers searched them between February 2010 and February 2012.

Prosecutors
 say the stories are strikingly similar: The men allege that Vagnini 
stopped them, placed his hand down their pants and probed their anus or 
shifted their genitals, saying he was looking for drugs.

Milwaukee
 County District Attorney John Chisholm charged Vagnini with 25 counts, 
including conducting an illegal strip search, misconduct in office, 
sexual assault and conducting an illegal body cavity search.

One of the victims testified under oath that officers stopped him in July 2011.

Vagnini
 pinched his anus, causing him to yell out 'Man, what are you doing? 
Don't touch me like that! You can't be doing that!' Vagnini replied with
 words to the effect of 'Be a man and give it up.'

Vagnini
 took the man to a room in a district police station, throwing a box in 
the room and told him if he defecated once in the box he would let him 
go.

The man tried to 
comply, investigators said in the complaint, but couldn't and was 
released with a ticket for driving with a suspended license.

Disgusted: Chief Edward Flynn told reporters at the time: 'Quite frankly I'm disgusted by the willful action of some of the officers of our police department'

Officers
 Dollhopf and Kozelek were in the room but did nothing to stop the 
proceedings and didn't report Vagnini to a supervisor, the complaint 
said.

A similar scenario 
allegedly took place that September, when Vagnini took a man he stopped 
to a room in the same police station after saying 'I want to see what 
he's got in his butt.'

He allegedly inserted his finger into the man's anus, prompting the man to call out 'This ain't right! Call my attorney!'

Vagnini then told the man to get the drugs out on his own, gave him a garbage can and had the man push the drugs out and place them into the can.

The complaint did not specify what type of drugs the man was hiding but said Dollhopf and Officer Jacob Knight were in the room and didn't try to stop Vagnini or report him.

Another victim testified that, in February, Vagnini saw him coming out of his aunt's house, cuffed him, and then searched his anus.

When the man tried to pull away, Vagnini put him in a chokehold. Two officers held his arms and one pressed a gun to his head, the victim said.

Chief Edward Flynn is under fire following the abhorrent scandal.

He told reporters at the time: 'Quite frankly I'm disgusted by the willful action of some of the officers of our police department.

'And I'm appalled by the willful inaction of some other officers in our police department in failing to stop egregious conduct. There's no justification for this.'
