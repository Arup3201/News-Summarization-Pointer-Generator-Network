Risk: The EU watchdog claims eating brown toast could put you at higher risk of getting cancer (file picture of model)

It's enough to make you choke on your marmalade. An EU watchdog says toast, that most British of breakfast delicacies, should be eaten only when it is a light yellow colour – not an appetising brown.

And heaven forbid if you prefer your toast – whisper it – burned!

The new warning from the European Food Safety Authority is designed to highlight the dangers of the chemical acrylamide, which forms in certain foods cooked at high temperatures. 

Putting health and safety high on our daily menus, the EU’s experts are also advising consumers not to eat dark, crunchy chips and crisps or to drink instant coffee – because of an increased risk of cancer.

The chemical is mainly found in crisps, savoury snacks, chips, soft and crispy breads, biscuits, crackers, cakes, cereals and coffee.

But more of Britain’s most beloved foods – such as crispy, dark roasted potatoes and jacket potatoes – could be affected as home cooks are urged to boil, steam or sautee potatoes instead of frying and roasting them.

Food manufacturers and catering outlets have already been improving processes to reduce acrylamide but the watchdog is anxious home cooks across Europe should also minimise the risks.

Consuming too much acrylamide has been linked to an increased risk of cancer for years but this is the first time European Commission scientists have studied the data and issued warnings to consumers.

Their draft opinion states: ‘Laboratory tests show acrylamide in the diet causes cancer in animals. Scientists conclude that acrylamide in food potentially increases the cancer risk for consumers of all ages.’

The chemical forms only in starchy foods – not burned or grilled meat, for example – when they are baked, fried or roasted in temperatures above 120C to 150C (248F to 302F).

This causes a process known as the Maillard reaction which browns the food, makes it crispy and crunchy and adds taste. But it also creates acrylamide which forms another substance known as glycidamide.

Dr Diane Benford, who heads EFSA’s expert committee on contaminants in food, said: ‘Glycidamide is the most likely cause of gene mutations and tumours seen in animal studies.’

Advice: The European Food Safety Authority is offering advice on how to make toast without risk 

An EFSA spokesman said: ‘We have published an infographic about acrylamide in food on our website to raise awareness among consumers throughout Europe.’

Britain’s Food Standards Agency already samples food products for acrylamide and levels have been decreasing. 

Out of 544 tests last year, only 17 products had higher levels of the chemical. But these included popular items such as Tesco’s own-brand ready salted crisps, Sainsbury’s wholegrain bran flakes, TUC Original salted snack biscuits and Hovis extra wheatgerm crackers.

An FSA spokesman said: ‘Consumers are not advised to stop eating any of the foods which are known to contain acrylamide but to follow Government advice on a healthy, balanced diet to minimise exposure.’

Tom Stansfeld, of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘While studies have shown acrylamide to cause cancer in mice and rats, research involving people is far less conclusive, and there isn’t good evidence of a link.’
