Fashion designer Dame Vivienne Westwood has used the launch of her new collection to urge Britons to 'vote Green' as all other parties preach 'consumption'.

She is reportedly donating £300,000 to the Green Party ahead of this year's general election and will be touring universities to promote the party's values to students.

The maverick designer, 73, who is known for her political activism, released a statement at her London Fashion Week show today saying: 'We are in incredible danger'.

She describes the kind of girl who would buy her Red Label clothes, saying: 'She is an art lover and she really thinks culture is very, very important.

'If we had true culture we would not be in the situation we're in. Culture has been replaced by consumption - which is quite a different thing.

'At the moment we are controlled by 1% of the world population who are in power.

'They preach consumption and they preach war, and they're taking us into disaster. We are in incredible danger.

'There is no point in voting for the others. She is going to vote Green.' 

Westwood has taken part in anti-fracking protests and has been a vocal supporter of environmentalist campaigns. 

She will be visiting Liverpool, Norwich, Brighton and Sheffield, among others, ahead of this year's general election.

'I am investing in the Green Party because I believe it is in the best interests of our country and our economy,' she said.

'I hope that by example other individuals and businesses will follow suit. If we get behind this we can make a real difference and the time is now.'

Amelia Womack, deputy leader of the party, will be accompanying Westwood, who previously donated £300,000 to the party, on the tour and speaking alongside her.

Westwood also wrote a pamphlet called End Capitalism, which explained one of her main reasons for voting for the Greens was because of its 'pro-community' stance.

Young Greens co-chair Clifford Fleming said the party was 'incredibly excited' to have the fashionista's support.
