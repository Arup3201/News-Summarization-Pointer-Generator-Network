A student who suffered a stroke has condemned the hospital where she was treated as a 'disgrace'.

Furious Jennie Cosh, 20, claims she was left fitting after nurses at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital ignored her calls - despite one standing at the bed next to her.

She says staff on the hospital's stroke ward were stretched beyond their limits, meaning they were not able to respond to patients' needs properly.

Stroke victim Jennie Cosh, 20, says her treatment at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital was a 'disgrace'

Jennie alleges that elderly patients were forced to soil themselves when there was no response to them repeatedly pressing the buzzer and loudly wailing for help.

The journalism student, who is now recovering at home in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, said she wanted to raise awareness of conditions in the hospital to help others.

She said: 'I was shocked at how poor the standard of care was at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital.

'I was lying in a hospital bed, having a fit, and a nurse just two metres away ignored my cries for help.

'It is supposed to be a "centre for excellence" for stroke victims but that wasn't my experience at all.

'I was put on a big ward in an open bay with very little privacy - and I was the youngest patient by about 60 years. Staff hardly paid any attention to me.

'I felt totally isolated and alone and it was worse for some of the elderly patients around me who were constantly buzzing for assistance and being ignored.

'One poor lady was buzzing repeatedly and, as there was no answer, she ended up soiling herself.

'Another threw up over herself. It was a disgrace.'

Jennie was suffering from a splitting headache, dizziness, blurred vision and a high temperature on June 26 last year while eating dinner with parents.

She went outside to cool down where she struggled with her right leg before taking a combined aspirin pain killer tablet.

Furious Jennie claims she was ignored by nurses even after calling out for help

Her worried parents took her to the doctor after her symptoms persisted and she was given the shock news that she had suffered a stroke.

Doctors have still not been able to pinpoint exactly what caused her stroke. Jennie describes herself as 'perfectly healthy' and does not smoke, drink or take drugs.

Jennie was admitted to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital hours after visiting the doctor and remained there until July 2.

She added: 'I remember at one point I started to feel faint and buzzed for a nurse. There was no response and I started fitting.

'Although there was a nurse on the very bed next to me, she didn't even acknowledge me for nearly 10 minutes.

'I couldn't believe how bad it was, but I was only there for a short time. But what about the elderly people who are in for weeks on end?'

Jennie has been left with limited feeling down her right side from the ordeal, but has been working hard to regain full fitness.

A spokesman for Gloucestershire Royal Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, said it would need more details for a full investigation.

He said: 'Gloucestershire Hospitals is committed to providing high quality and safe care for our patients and we take complaints seriously.

'We are disappointed to hear that Jennie Cosh was unhappy with the care provided. We would like to invite her to speak to us about her concerns.'

Paralympic athlete Mel Nicholls suffered three strokes before the age of 30, while pop star Jessie J had a stroke at 18.
