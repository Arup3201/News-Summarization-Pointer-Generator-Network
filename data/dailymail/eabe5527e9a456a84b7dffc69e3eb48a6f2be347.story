Barclays saw more than £2billion wiped off its value yesterday as it revealed emergency plans to help plug a £12.8billion black hole in its finances.

The embattled lender said it would go cap in hand to shareholders to try to raise £5.8billion by selling new shares.

The huge shortfall in the amount it needs to cushion itself from future financial shocks was almost twice as big as expected, causing its shares to plunge almost 6 per cent, knocking £2.3billion off its value.

Towering challenge: The bank is looking to raise £5.8billion through a share issue as they shore up their finances

The lender, which has a huge casino 
banking operation built up under disgraced former boss Bob Diamond, is 
the only lender on the high street forced to take such drastic action.

It came as Barclays revealed another 
£2 billion bill to compensate customer mis-sold payment protection 
insurance as well as small businesses duped into paying for complex 
investments alongside loans.

Richard Lloyd  from consumer group 
Which? said: ‘The eye watering PPI compensation bill continues to 
escalate, showing how much banks have been in denial about the scale of 
their mis-selling.’

Profits in the first half of the year slumped 17pc to £3.6 billion compared to the same period last year.

Last month the Bank of England 
ordered lenders to plug a £27.1 billion shortfall in the amount of 
capital they need to protect themselves against future losses.

Barclays, Nationwide, the Co-op Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds all fell short.

But Barclays and Nationwide were the only two banks to miss  tougher ‘leverage ratio’ rules restricting how much they can lend.

These dictate that banks can lend up to £33 for every £1 of capital they hold in reserve.

Share issue: Barclays are issuing £5.8billion worth of new shares to meet new regulatory requirements

Barclays plans to raise £5.8 billion 
by selling new discounted shares to existing investors, including just 
under 700,000 ordinary shareholders.

The bulk is likely to be snapped up by pension funds and investment firms.

If they do not take up the offer, 
investors will see the value of their existing shares eroded as millions
of new Barclays shares are flooded into the market.

Prospectuses will be sent to investors in September with the bank aiming to complete the shares sale in October.

It also hopes to raise up to £2 billion by issuing high interest bonds – known as Co cos -  to customers.

These are effectively IOUs, whereby an investor lends the bank money and receives regular interest payments in return.

The rest of money will be raised by winding down some of the complex financing provided to big businesses and pension funds.

Barclays had hoped to meet the target
by the end of 2015 but lost a battle with the Bank of England’s safety 
watchdog the Prudential Regulation Authority.

It will have to plug the shortfall in its finances by June next year.

Barclays’ chief executive Antony 
Jenkins came under fire  last month after he said the bank may have to 
cut lending in order to meet the targets.

But yesterday he insisted that there 
would be no reduction on the amount of loans provided to households and 
businesses as a result of its plans.

Hit: Shares in Barclays fell around 5 per cent upon opening this morning, but are still up significantly in the last 12 months

Denying that the shortfall in its 
finances was a result of ‘reckless trading,’ Jenkins said: ‘This will 
not affect our lending to businesses or support for the mortgage market 
in the UK.’

The news came as Barclays revealed the spiraling cost of past wrong doing.

This included a provision of £1.35 
billion to compensate customers mis-sold payment protection insurance 
alongside loans and credit cards.

This takes its bill for the scandal 
to just under £4 billion, with High Street lenders racking up a total 
bill of almost £18 billion so far.

Barclays also set aside £650 million 
to compensate businesses mis-sold  interest rate swaps to small 
businesses alongside loans.

Thousands of firms, from fish and 
chip shops to hair salons, were duped into buying these complex 
financial instruments which were meant to protect them against rising 
interest rates.

But when interest rates fell to 
record lows many were left stranded on expensive contracts or hit with 
crippling bills if they wanted to switch to a cheaper loan.

Barclays boss Antony Jenkins has promised to clean up the bank since replacing  former chief executive Bob Diamond last summer.

Diamond was ousted after Barclays was fined £290 million by British and American regulators for rigging Libor interest rates.

But a string of scandals continue to dog the bank.

These include an investigation by the
Serious Fraud Office into its previous fund raising with Qatar 
investors during the financial crisis.
