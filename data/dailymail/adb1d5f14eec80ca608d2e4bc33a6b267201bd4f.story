A New Jersey Walmart customer has become the owner of a number of fish she purchased after discovering a dozen dirty fish tanks filled with dead and dying fish at her local store.

Donna Lohmeyer was with her young grandson when the pair went to look at the live fish at the Flanders Walmart outlet.

Instead of happily swimming pet fish, Lohmeyer and her grandson came upon a nightmarish scene.

Cruel: Fish were left to die in tanks without filtration or light in freezing temperatures

'Most [of the fish] were dead, and rotting in the tanks... Many were still swimming â€” starving, freezing, choking on foul water full of ammonia and algae,' Lohmeyer told Mendham-Chester Patch.

She says there was no power or filtration in any of the tanks, but they were still full of fish.

Other customers in the live pets section of the store told Lohmeyer that the power had been off for more than a week.The water temperature in the tanks was 64 degrees, she said.

Neglect: Other customers said the power had been off for more than a week and the tanks were full of dead fish

The disgusted customer asked to see the store's manager and was told he was unavailable. She then asked to see the pet department manager, who was 'on break.'

After waiting more than an hour, Lohmeyer purchased the remaining 'least sick' fish to rescue them from the putrid tanks.

Mendham-Chester Patch contacted Walmart's head office in Arkansas and was told the store had stopped selling live fish 'months ago.'

Training: Walmart says it will retrain workers in the Flanders store in how to correctly care for live fish

Patch responded with pictures taken by Lohmeyer's daughter Dina of the tanks in their local Walmart.

Walmart representative Kayla Whiting finally responded after receiving the pictures, saying, 'This is unacceptable.'

'There are protocols in place that were not followed, and associates [in the pet department] will be retrained immediately,' she told Patch.

No Walmart staff members have been punished for the incident.
