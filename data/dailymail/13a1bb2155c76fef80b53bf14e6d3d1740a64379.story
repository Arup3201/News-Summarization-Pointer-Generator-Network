A century on, the four seasons bring constant changes to the scarred landscapes and ruins of the World War I battlefields in Belgium and northern France.

Spring has its red poppies; summer its sun-kissed green foliage; autumn stuns with vibrant colours; and winter brings the bleakness of rain and mud.

Soldiers of the 1914-1918 Great War had precious little time to appreciate the colour. Instead they endured the mud as relentless shelling destroyed woods and villages and created desolate, treeless landscapes, while many cities were reduced to heaps of rubble.

One hundred years and the force of nature have slowly changed those haunted places, yet many of the relics still exist, both above and below the surface. 

Some bunkers have turned into stables; shell craters became drinking ponds for cattle. Many trenches and tunnels remained largely untouched on what was known as the Western Front, a battle line stretching from Belgium to the Swiss border.

Each season offers a different view to the relic hunter.

A road that seems to yield nothing in summer due to heavy foliage unveils a trove of treasures in the desolate winter.

The Ziegler Bunker in Boezinge, Belgium, is one of the best preserved on the Ypres Salient, and the line of bunkers on Aubers Ridge in France give the viewer an idea of how important high ground was in World War I...

A WWI bunker at the Fort of Walem in Walem, Belgium. The fort was built in 1878 as part of the fortifications around the city of Antwerp. After heavy shelling during WWI in 1914, the fort surrendered and under the rubble still lie the bodies of Belgian soldiers 

A wooden cross with a poppy is left at a bomb crater named the 'Pool of Peace' in Heuvelland, Belgium. The crater was created by the largest of 19 mine explosions detonated to signal the start of the Messines phase of the Third Battle of Ypres. The explosion was set off on June 7, 1917 underneath one of the then highest German front-line positions on Messines Ridge. The blasts were reportedly heard as far away as London

The Ziegler bunker in Boezinge, Belgium. It is sometimes referred to as the 'Viking Ship' due to its shape. The bunker was constructed by the German Army and later conquered by the French

Two German bunkers on farmland in Pervijze, Belgium. One hundred years after the guns went silent, thousands of bunkers still exist along what was the Western Front which stretched from Belgium to the Swiss border. Many are protected by local historical authorities while many others decay slowly

Anzac Camp bunkers in Voormezele, Belgium. The bunkers were originally constructed by the British. Their location was close to the front line with trenches running both in front of and behind the bunkers

British trenches are preserved at Hill 62, Sanctuary Wood in Ypres, Belgium. The farmer who owned the site was required to leave his land in 1914 when the war began. After returning to reclaim the land, much was cleared away, but he continued to maintain part of the trench

The remains of the Chateau de la Hutte, in Ploegsteert, Belgium. The chateau, due to its high position, served as an observation post for the British artillery but soon afterwards was destroyed by German artillery. The cellars would serve as a shelter for a great part of the war and Canadian soldiers soon nicknamed it 'Henessy Chateau', after the name of the owner

A bomb crater from World War I named 'Ultimo' is surrounded by a fence and trees in St Yves, Belgium. The crater is a result of one of several explosions under the German front line

An artillery shell lies at the opening of a bunker near Beaucamps-Ligny, France. Fifteen British WWI soldiers were re-buried at nearby Y Farm Commonwealth cemetery in Bois-Grenier, France on Oct 22, 2014, nearly a century after they died in battle. The soldiers, who served with the 2nd Battalion, York and Lancaster Regiment, were discovered in a field five years ago in Beaucamps-Ligny and identified through a variety of means, including DNA

The remains of the German Lange Max gun pit in Koekelare, Belgium. It was originally designed to be a naval gun, but was later adapted as a railroad gun which was capable of long range

A German-built bunker next to the roadside in La Bassee, France. The bunker was named Le Trois Maisons (the three houses). La Bassee was occupied by the Germans from October 1914 and was part of the battleground of what is known as the 'Race to the Sea'. This 'race'  saw reciprocal attempts by the Franco-British and German armies to envelop the northern flank of the opposing army through Picardy, Artois and Flanders - rather than an attempt to advance northwards to the sea

The remains of a German bunker (left) at the Australian Memorial Park in Fromelles, France. The park is situated on what would have been the German defensive line during battles in 1916 against Australian forces. Right, a bunker on Aubers Ridge near Illies, France. Aubers Ridge offered German troops as of Oct 1914 a strategic advantage by being located on the high ground near the River Lys

A German-built bunker (left) next to a farm building in Lizerne, Belgium. Local archaeologists have recently discovered Belgian and French trenches in the area, which was bitterly fought over during the war and was also the site of one of the first poison gas attacks. Right, a bunker is covered in overgrowth in Fromelles

The British bunker at Hellfire Corner in Ypres, Belgium. The section was given this name due to the frequent shelling by the German Army

A German trench at the Bayernwald Trench site in Wijtschate, Belgium. The area was instrumental for the German Army in the assault on Messines Ridge. The trench was restored in 1998 after being abandoned for nearly 100 years and is based on an actual German trench that existed on the site

The Western Front circa 1916: British infantrymen occupy a shallow trench in a ruined landscape before an advance

Some 7.5million men lost their lives on the Western Front during World War One.

The front was opened when the German Army invaded Luxembourg and Belgium in 1914 and then moved into the industrial regions in northern France.

In September of that year, this advance was halted, and slightly reversed, at the Battle Of Marne.

It was then that both sides dug vast networks of trenches that ran all the way from the North Sea to the Swiss border with France.

This line of tunnels remained unaltered, give or take a mile, for most of the four-year conflict.

By 1917, after years of deadlock that saw millions of soldiers killed for zero gain on either side, new military technology including poison gas, tanks and planes was deployed on the front.

Thanks to these techniques, the Allies slowly advanced throughout 1918 until the war's end in November.

But the scars will forever remain.
