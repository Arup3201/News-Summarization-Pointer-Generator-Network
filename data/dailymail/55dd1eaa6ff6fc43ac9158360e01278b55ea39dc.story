A new clothing company allows fashion lovers to rent jeans on a monthly basis - and then trade them in for a new pair when they get bored of wearing them.

Holland-based brand Mud Jeans, the brainchild of Dutch entrepreneur Bert van Son, leases a variety of different styles of jeans for the bargain price of $7.40 per month, and then recycles any returned products in order to create new clothing designs and accessories, from sweaters to shoulder bags.

The company even offers a free repair service to customers who damage their jeans during the lease period. 

'It's about being on trend': Mud Jeans invites customers to lease their favorite pair for a monthly fee - and then return them when they get bored

Suitable for everybody: The company offers products for both men and women 

'The idea favors usage over ownership, tapping into a new consumer philosophy,' Mr van Son told Co.Exist. 'It's about being on trend without ever actually owning clothes.'

Having successfully trialed the concept in the Netherlands, the entrepreneur and his son Michiel Van Son are now trying to raise the funds needed to bring the idea to the United States.

Thus far, the pair have raised just under $15,000 via their Kickstarter page and are hoping that the business - and its core ideals - will soon be ready to go global. 

'We’re the first brand to introduce a rental system for jeans,' the page explains. 'All returned jeans are recycled. Why? Recycling diminishes the amount of waste, water and consumption of raw materials.'

Michiel adds: 'My father’s dream started two years ago when he launched Mud Jeans. With 30 years of experience in the textile industry, he was frustrated by business models founded on the presumption of unlimited and cheap natural resources. It was time for a change. 

'He wanted to tap into a new consuming philosophy, one based on using instead of owning. People have always rented cars and washing machines, so why wouldn’t they lease jeans?'

In addition to the jeans, fashion fans can also lease hoodies and shoulder bags, all of which are made from organic materials and produced using only the most eco-friendly methods. 

'Mud Jeans wanted to challenge itself by designing denim that requires less production water,' the brand description says. 'After many samples, we’re proud to introduce DRY MUD. Probably the driest denim in the world! Unwashed denim needs less maintenance. 

'Unwashed denim needs less maintenance': Customers are encouraged to only wash their jeans after wearing them for a few months

Money-makers: Mud Jeans' founders Bert and Michiel van Son are hoping to raise enough money to set up a base for their business in the US

'Mud Jeans encourages you to wait months before you first wash them and even longer for the next wash. The men’s product is a 12.5 ounce denim made from 30% recycled denim and 70% organic cotton. The women’s is made from 98% organic cotton and 2% elastane for extra comfort.' 

Eventually the brand's creators hope to have bases in various locations around the world and are eager to establish what they refer to as 'Mud Recycle Hubs', where customers can return their old jeans for recycling before selecting a new pair. 

'You can enjoy DRY MUD for as long as you like, keeping in mind that each pair belongs to Mud,' the website states. 

'Once they're worn out, you can pick out a new pair and send back the old. New denim yarn is born when returned jeans are shredded and blended with virgin cotton. From this yarn new products are made...'
