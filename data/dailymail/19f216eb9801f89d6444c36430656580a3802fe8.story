Thai authorities have arrested a beach vendor after he shoved and chased away a Russian tourist because she wouldn’t rent a sunlounger or parasol from him.

The heated confrontation on Koh Larn, a picturesque island in the Gulf of Thailand, was recorded by a fellow beachgoer and the online video clip has gone viral in the Southeast Asian country.

It shows the pushy male vendor hovering over the woman and kicking sand at her as she attempted to soak up the sun in a public area where sunlounger or parasol rentals are not required.

After approaching her on popular Nang Nual Beach, the angry vendor circles the woman, who is seated on a beach towel, and berates her as she begins to pack up her belongings and put on her flip-flops.

The argument continues as the vendor, standing impatiently with his left hand on his hip, starts to kick sand at the upset holidaymaker. 

That’s when the woman jumped to her feet and whipped her towel toward the vendor, spraying sand in his face, which is covered.

He proceeds to grab the bikini-clad woman by the arm and shove her away from the water, but she stands her ground and continues to plead her case.

With more force, the aggressive man shoves the woman a second time and she storms off camera and continues to shout at him.

Fellow beachgoers are seen relaxing or playing nearby, but no one bothers to intervene on the woman's behalf.

A report in the Bangkok Post said the bullying incident sparked a police investigation that led to the arrest of a 28-year-old man.

The man, from Cambodia, was held because he entered Thailand illegally, but he was not charged for the confrontation because the victim is no longer in the country and it would be difficult to secure a conviction, authorities told the newspaper.

The vendor, known as Ping, told police the incident occurred last year and he was following his boss’ orders. The video found its way onto the Internet this month.

In an act of embarrassment, police took the handcuffed vendor back to the beach on Sunday and forced him to re-enact the row with a model as a photographer snapped pictures that were shared with Thai media.
