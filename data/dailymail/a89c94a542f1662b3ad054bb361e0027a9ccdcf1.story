Barack Obama's new White House video may be filled with shots of beautiful Alaska scenery, but it was a mere five seconds that got everyone talking.

The minute-long film was released to announce a new push by the administration to protect a large portion of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for preservation, effectively protecting it from oil drilling. 

But it wasn't only the video's message that riled Republicans - it was the fact the clip featured Obama explaining the new initiative while en route to India on Air Force One, an aircraft with a fuel capacity of 53,611 gallons.

President Obama was criticized after a new White House video announcing his administration's push to protect a large portion of Alaska's Artic National Wildlife Refuge featured him on Air Force One 

'Alaska's National Wildlife Refuge is an incredible place — pristine, undisturbed' Obama begins in the video as various shots of Alaska's wildlife and landscapes skate by

'Alaska's National Wildlife Refuge is an incredible place — pristine, undisturbed,' Obama begins in the video as various shots of Alaska's wildlife and landscapes skate by. 

'It supports caribou and polar bears, all manner of marine life, countless species of birds and fish, and for centuries it supported many Alaska Native communities. But it's very fragile.

'That's why I'm very proud my Department of Interior has put forth a comprehensive plan to make sure we're protecting the refuge and designating new areas, including Coastal Plains, for preservation. 

'And I'm going to be calling on Congress to make sure they take it one step further, designating it as a wilderness so we can make sure this amazing wonder is preserved for future generations.'

The plan, which would protect 12 million acres of the Artic National Wildlife Refuge from oil drilling, has angered Republicans in the state and Washington alike.

Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, the new chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee,  said the move 'effectively declared war on Alaska', Politico reported. 

'It supports caribou and polar bears, all manner of marine life, countless species of birds and fish, and for centuries it supported many Alaska Native communities. But it's very fragile,' he said

'What's coming is a stunning attack on our sovereignty and our ability to develop a strong economy that allows us, our children and our grandchildren to thrive,' she later said in a joint statement with other legislators in the state. 

'It's clear this administration does not care about us, and sees us as nothing but a territory. We will fight back with every resource at our disposal.' 

Alaska Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan called the move 'just one more example of President Obama thumbing his nose at the citizens of a sovereign state' and said it 'will put Alaska and America’s energy security in serious jeopardy.'

Just days before Obama released his video, Sen. Murkowski introduced a bill to permit oil production in the refuge.

The White House has defended the proposed expansion in a blog post written by presidential counselor John Podesta and Mike Boots, head of the White House Council on Environmental Quality.

'The Obama administration believes that oil and natural gas resources can be developed safely. Unfortunately, accidents and spills can still happen,' they write. 

'The Coastal Plain of the Arctic Refuge, one of the few remaining places in the country as pristine today as it was when the oldest Alaska Native communities first set eyes on it, is too precious to put at risk. 

'By designating the area as wilderness, Congress could preserve the Coastal Plain in perpetuity — ensuring that this wild, free, beautiful, and bountiful place remains in trust for Alaska Natives and for all Americans.'

Environmental groups likewise heralded the move, which would protect a site that is vital for Alaska's wildlife.

'This wilderness recommendation has been a long time coming for the place where life begins for the porcupine caribou herd and for many of America's polar bears,' Center for Biological Diversity Alaska director Rebecca Noblin said. 

Jamie Williams, president of The Wilderness Society, said in a released statement: 'Some places are simply too special to drill, and we are thrilled that a federal agency has acknowledged that the refuge merits wilderness protection.' 

Democrats and Republicans have debated oil drilling in the region, which is currently off-limits and is estimated to hold 10.3 billion barrels of recoverable oil, since the 1970s. 

Congress has tried and failed repeatedly to get legislation to open up the 1.5 million-acre coastal plain to drilling in the past. It came closest in 1995, when President Bill Clinton vetoed it. 

Obama wouldn't be any more receptive if Congress passed legislation again and his wilderness designation will require Congress' approval too. 

And Republicans in Congress, already critical of the administration on its energy policies on federal lands, are just as unlikely to give Obama what he wants.

But the president's new initiative is just the beginning of a series of decisions that the Interior Department could make this week concerning the state's oil and gas production, the Washington Post reports. 

The department will also consider whether to impose additional limits on oil and gas production in parts of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, as well as the Artic Ocean.  

But environmental groups  heralded the move and said 'some places are simply too special to drill'
