Two of Britain’s supermarket giants have locked horns after Tesco reported a surge in sales but Sainsbury’s disputed the figures.

Tesco, the UK’s biggest retailer, said takings for the six weeks around Christmas were up by 1.8 per cent on the year before.

However, Sainsbury’s claimed the rise, the biggest for three years, was an exaggeration.

Improvement: Tesco recorded its best Christmas figures for three years, with like-for-like sales up 1.8 per cent

The attack – evidence of an increasingly bitter battle between the two – was swiftly dismissed by Tesco as a ‘smear’.

Sainsbury’s pointed out that Tesco’s 
figure included sales made through vouchers given to shoppers under its 
Clubcard loyalty scheme. An email from Sainsbury’s said the 1.8 per cent
figure was ‘disingenuous’.

But even without the voucher sales, at
1.4 per cent Tesco’s rise was ahead of the 0.9 per cent at Sainsbury’s 
for the same period.

Significant investment: Tesco has taken on an extra 8,000 staff and launched its Everyday Value range

Shoppers buying food and drink online for Christmas gave Tesco a particular boost, with website sales up by 18 per cent.

'More to do': Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke is trying to reverse the fall in profits recorded by the chain last year

More than half a million food orders were fulfilled in the week before Christmas.

The sales surge follows a £1billion 
action plan by Tesco  to refurbish stores, employ 8,000 more customer 
service staff and launch new ranges.

These included Everyday Value 
budget products, which along with upmarket Finest outperformed other 
ranges.

The latest figures are a stark 
contrast with a year ago, when Tesco revealed a Christmas sales slump of
2.3 per cent and its shares lost almost £5billion in a day.

While Sainsbury’s executives launched a
series of briefings to accuse Tesco of massaging the figures, the boost
surprised the City, bringing a 3 per cent rise in the share price 
yesterday.

John Ibbotson, of consultants Retail 
Vision, said: ‘After a listless 2012, the empire strikes back.

'With 
like-for-like sales growth jumping to its highest level for three years,
Tesco has come out fighting.

'The £1billion invested in revamping stores
and boosting customer service is finally delivering a handsome return.’

Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke 
said: ‘I am pleased with our performance over the important Christmas 
and New Year period in the UK.’

But he added: ‘Whilst our seasonal performance is encouraging, there is a lot more to do.’

Some analysts were cautious, 
suggesting it would take further improvements to demonstrate the 
company, which takes £30 of every £100 spent in supermarkets, has seen a
permanent return to growth.
