Young One Direction fans have been left 'inconsolable' after buying standing tickets for the band's hotly anticipated arena tour only to discover that under-12s must be seated.

Parents have been treating their children to tickets for the group's concerts, but some have failed to read the small print which includes restrictions for the youngest fans.

One of those is Lynsay Short who bought her eight-year-old daughter Ruby Lynn a Â£50 ticket to see the band at the Stadium of Light in Sunderland next month.

'Inconsolable': Eight-year-old Ruby Lynn is devastated after being bought standing tickets to see her idols One Direction on their arena tour only to learn that under-12s must be seated at their gigs

Ruby, who has a shrine to 1D in her room, was all set to see her idols on May 28 with her mother, aunt Sharon, 42, and cousin Abbiegail, 11, who is also banned from the standing area.

But last week Mrs Short, of Grangetown, near Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, saw an article in their local paper about how under-12s would not be allowed into the standing stalls.

Mrs Short, 36, said she hadn't read the small print on the website when she paid for the tickets.

She said: 'Ruby is inconsolable and she hasn't stopped crying. It is so cruel to raise a little girl's hopes like this only to dash them.

'When I saw it in the paper I contacted the stadium to double check it was correct. I can see absolutely no reason why kids aren't allowed in the standing area.

'It is absolutely ridiculous, they say it is for health and safety reasons, but that is just stupid.

'I would have been right beside Ruby the whole time, and if there had been any trouble I could have just picked her up.

'We have been in the standing area of concerts before and it is absolutely fine.

'I am not sure if One Direction are involved, but the stadium have said it is not their policy, it has come from One Direction.

'I don't think this will stop Ruby from liking One Direction, but I am certainly not happy with them.'

Mrs Short says is now desperately trying to sell her tickets online and says she cannot bear to attend the concert without her daughter.

She believes that the terms and conditions should have been made a lot more clearer on purchase.

Ruby has been a One Direction fan since they were on the X-Factor and her favourite is Louis.

She was also left devastated last year when her mother failed to get her a ticket because they had all sold out.

One Direction's management, Modest Management, were approached for a comment but did not respond.

A spokesperson for the Stadium of Light said: 'The age restrictions apply to every One Direction show at every UK venue, they are not specific to the Stadium of Light and have been put in place centrally to ensure the safety and comfort of everyone attending the concerts.

'The terms and conditions of sale of the tickets, along with FAQ's on the various ticketing websites, clearly state the age restrictions at point of purchase.'
