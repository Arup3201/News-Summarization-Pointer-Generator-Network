Pione Sisto's parents decided to celebrate their son's call-up to Denmark's Under 21 side by interrupting a press conference and making a song and dance about it.

The FC Midtjylland midfielder is originally from Uganda but  is eligible to play for Denmark as he moved away from his homeland as a baby.

The Danes have moved quickly to hand him an international call-up following the 19-year-old's impressive start to the league campaign - and to mark the occasion his parents performed a tribal dance in front of the cameras.

Sisto was named the Danish Superliga Player of the Year for 2014 at the start of December after shining in Glen Riddersholm's side during the past couple of seasons.

His parents, who were both covered in white powder, danced in front of the Danish media during the press conference.

However they were not fazed as they sang while onlookers watched on in surprise. Sisto eventually joined his parents before being covered in white powder and posing for pictures.

Sisto has scored seven goals in 17 league games for Danish league leaders FC Midtjylland so far this season.
