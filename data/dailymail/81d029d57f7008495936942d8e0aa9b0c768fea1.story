Julie Bishop revealed she should have been a long distance runner in a recent interview and now she has taken strides to show that she was not joking.

The foreign affairs minister hit the pavement on Monday morning on the way to Parliament House in the nation's capital.

Sporting a blue tank top layered over a pink T-shirt, Australia's most powerful woman gripped her phone as she made tracks to work.

The foreign affairs minister hit the pavement on Monday morning on the way to Parliament House in the nation's capital 

Although she was out of office for her training she was seen with her phone gripped tightly in her hand 

Leading by example! Health Minister Susan Ley also turned up to work in her exercise gear after some early morning training

Julie Bishop had swapped her training gear for a more appropriate option by the time she took her place next to the Prime Minister Tony Abbott in parliament

But she was not alone in trying to get more active.

Health Minister Sussan Lay was also seen strapping on her blue sneakers.

Dressed in a navy workout skirt and teal T-shirt, Ms Lay was seen entering Parliament House with a black handbag on her shoulder.

In a candid interview with Australian Women's Weekly in this month's issue, Ms Bishop spoke about her love of running and how it was her way to relax after a hard day's work.

'I'll run and run and run... I should have been a long distance runner,' she said.

It has been a stressful few weeks for Ms Bishop who has been negotiating with the Indonesian government to stop the execution of Bali Nine duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukuraman.

The foreign affairs minister has said that she loves to exercise and that it helps her overcome jetlag

Julie Bishop has revealed she should have been a 'long distance runner' in a magazine interview because she runs to get over jetlag and it helps to keep her balanced and focused

Ms Bishop, who became the first female deputy leader of the Liberal Party and the first to be Foreign Affairs Minister, is now one of the most famous faces in Australian politics

Along with that, she has had to stave off rumours of her taking over the top job from Tony Abbott.

But all these issues seemed a million miles away for Ms Bishop as she worked up a sweat on the streets of Canberra. 

The foreign minister has made no secret that she is a keen runner.

She runs to get over jetlag after meeting with some of the world's most powerful leaders.

Even when Ms Bishop is back home in Perth at the beach taking time out from the hustle and bustle of Canberra, she's still running.

The 58-year-old has even spent the past 17 years climbing up the political ranks.

Ms Bishop, who became the first female deputy leader of the Liberal Party and the first woman to be foreign minister, is now one of the most famous faces in Australian politics.

She is renowned for her immaculate and polished appearance as she makes deals and shakes hands with some of the world's most powerful leaders. 

But when she does go back home, she can often be found having a coffee at the surf club where she is vice-patron in just a 'T-shirt and shorts', the magazine reports.

It's in stark contrast to the Armani brand clothing, red high heels and pearl and diamond earrings she is normally photographed wearing.

People have revealed deep down Ms Bishop is in fact a 'girly girl', but she maintains it only takes her 30 minutes to shower, dress and do her hair and make-up every morning.

Ms Bishop, who is renowned for her immaculate and polished appearance, holds her own in the male-dominated top ranks of the Liberal party 

She regularly flies across the world to meet with the top leaders in her role as Foreign Minister

Ms Bishop first took up a ministry position when former Prime Minister John Howard (back) appointed her as Minister for Ageing in 2003. She is pictured here being sworn in by Governor-General Michael Jeffery (right)

Ms Bishop, who up until last year was the only woman in Prime Minister Tony Abbott's Cabinet, is no stranger to operating in a male-dominated environment.

As a new recruit in her first job at a legal firm in 1978, Ms Bishop was asked to hand around drinks at a function while her male counterpart was allowed to mingle with the partners.

'I knew I couldn't stay at that firm,' she told Women's Weekly.

At age 38, she became managing partner at Clayton Utz law firm and was tasked with managing 27 top male lawyers.

Yet she famously came out last year and refused to identify herself as a feminist.

She  does not have children, but her new relationship with property developer David Panton received a flurry of attention when they were photographed at the Melbourne Cup racing carnival together last year

Despite Liberal leadership speculation over the past month, Ms Bishop still maintains she is happy in her current role as Foreign Minister

She is not married and does not have children, but her new relationship with property developer David Panton received a flurry of attention when they were photographed at the Melbourne Cup racing carnival together last year.

Her popularity has jumped over the past 12 months, mainly due to her strong performance on the international stage in relation to foreign diplomacy and national security.

Ms Bishop fiercely confronted Russian President Vladimir Putin late last month at a summit in Italy to question him over the MH17 disaster over the Ukraine.

Ms Bishop grew up on a cherry farm and was educated at the prestigious St Peter's Collegiate Girls School in Adelaide. She is pictured in 1982

The Foreign Minister was also regarded for pushing the resolution the United Nations Security Council passed back in July to allow Australia and other countries access to the Malaysian Airlines crash site to retrieve the bodies.

But despite Liberal leadership speculation over the past month, Ms Bishop still maintains she is happy in her current role as Foreign Minister.

'(I'm) living the dream and loving the job,' she told Daily Mail Australia in November. 

'I am in the best job I could ever wish for. It's the job I wanted to do when I went into politics.'
