Users of legal highs have been warned that they are ‘dancing in a minefield’ after a huge surge in the number of deaths.

Ninety-seven people were found dead with the substances in their system in 2012, up from 12 in 2009. It means the toll has risen by eight times in three years.

In around two thirds of cases, the post-mortem examination established that the legal high was the direct cause of death.

Professor Fabrizio Schifano, of the National Programme on Substance Abuse Deaths at St George’s University of London, warned: ‘These type of drugs are showing up more than ever before. 

‘Clearly this is a major public health concern and we must continue to monitor this worrying development. Those experimenting with such substances are effectively dancing in a minefield.’

The figures were compiled from reports submitted to the university by coroners. 

Of the 97 deaths involving legal highs, around a third were chemically similar to the illegal drug mephedrone – known as meow meow or bubbles.

Ketamine will today be made a Class B banned substance amid fears that it is ruining young people’s health.

Anybody caught possessing the horse tranquilliser, which is used as a party drug, will face up to five years in jail. 

Known as Special K, it was taken by up to 120,000 people last year.

But there is mounting evidence that it is causing huge health damage, 
with users as young as 20 being forced to have their bladders removed 
due to its toxic effects.

It has also been linked to a string of deaths.The drug achieved notoriety when ex-Co-op bank boss the Reverend Paul Flowers was caught trying to buy it.

In December, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs said that ketamine should be upgraded from Class C to B.

That
 recommendation has now been accepted by Home Secretary Theresa May. 
Other Class B drugs include cannabis and amphetamines such as speed.

Others mimicked the effects of amphetamines such as ketamine, while one was linked to a synthetic form of cannabis. In many cases, users took multiple substances as well as alcohol.

The report warns that many legal highs have undergone no human testing and the damage they do is ‘virtually unknown’.

Maryon Stewart, whose medical student daughter Hester died after taking the legal high GBL, warned: ‘Young people are largely unaware of how grave a threat they face from legal highs. 

‘With precious little education on these substances, young people are living in an information vacuum.

‘The appalling tragedies in the report are all avoidable so it is absolutely critical everyone wakes up to the dangers to our children from these untested substances.’ 

Another legal high victim was Adam Hunt, who bought a substance called AMT over the internet from Holland in August. 

Four days after he took the drug, he was dead. His mother Bernadette found the 18-year-old collapsed in his bedroom. 

He was taken to hospital but doctors were unable to save him.

Originally developed as an anti-depressant, AMT is a ‘psychedelic’ drug which can have effects similar to ecstasy. However, it can also cause severe nausea and anxiety.

Adam passed 11 GCSEs and had been studying electrical engineering at college.

Determined: Last night crime prevention minister Norman Baker said: 'I am determined to clamp down on the reckless trade in so-called legal highs'

In a statement after his death, his parents said: ‘He was very thoughtful and caring and loved his family and friends dearly.

‘His life had such potential and was all in front of him. Sadly it has been cut very short.’

The report also recorded growing numbers of deaths from cocaine, which reached 115, and ecstasy.

Last night crime prevention minister Norman Baker said: ‘I am determined to clamp down on the reckless trade in so-called legal highs which, as this report shows, has tragically claimed the lives of far too many people in our country.’
