The batman's funeral service was held earlier this month in his hometown of Macksville as thousands bid an emotional farewell as they gathered to say their goodbyes.

While mourners across the world paid tribute to the cricketer by placing their beloved cricket bats outside their homes as a sign of respect and posting it on social media with the hashtag #putoutyourbats.

Meanwhile, Phillip's older brother returned to Sydney grade cricket for the first time since the Australia batsman's death - with the most appropriate score.

Jason Hughes scored 63 for Mosman against Sydney, the same number of runs his famous brother had made when he was fatally struck by a bouncer two weeks ago.

The elder Hughes was said by onlookers to to be emotional when walking out to bat for the first time since Phillip died on November 27, and also when he reached 50.

He apparently did not know the score he was on when he fell to the bowling of Nathan Sowter.

Jason had been encouraged by Phillip to move to Sydney to play cricket and spoke at his brother's funeral, thanking him for helping him develop as a person and a cricketer.

'You have given me confidence, strength, you supported me and gave me a strong desire to succeed,' he said.

There was also a tribute to Phillip at the first Test against India in Adelaide, where his friend David Warner looked heavenward during an on-field post-match interview to thank him for the win.
