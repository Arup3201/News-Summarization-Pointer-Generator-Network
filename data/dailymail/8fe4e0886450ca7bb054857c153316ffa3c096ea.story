The Spanish royal couple visited Malaga this week, paying a visit to a museum celebrating the work of modern artist Pablo Picasso.

Leaving daughters Leonor and Sofia at home, Queen Letizia, 41, and King Felipe, 46, made a stop at the art museum before going on to a formal dinner.

Queen Letizia stepped out in an elegant black dress with a sheer, embellished back by Spanish designer Felipe Varela, coupled with heeled sandals and a black clutch. Her outfit was complemented by a soft, sweeping up-do and understated make-up.

The pair are visiting the Spanish region of Andalucía for the first time since they came to the throne earlier this year. Last month they enjoyed an intimate family holiday in Mallorca.

So far this year Felipe and Letizia have already visited the regions of Cataluña, Castilla y Leon, Galicia and the Balearic Islands and will be jetting off again later this month when they visit the UN in New York.
