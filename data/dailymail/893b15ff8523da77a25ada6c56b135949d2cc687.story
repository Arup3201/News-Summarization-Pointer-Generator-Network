Host nation Brazil narrowly scraped through to the Quarter-Finals of the World Cup in a nail-biting finish to this Group of 16 tie against Chile.

The world's number one-rated team played South American rivals Chile at Mineirao Stadium in Belo Horizonte probably expecting a relatively easy win.

The Chileans had a different view and took the game to the hosts who are bidding to be world champions for the sixth time. It could easily happen, given the momentum that is gathering behind this team, but to outsiders, based on objective evidence they look anything but champions.

Still when Gonzalo Jara stepped up and struck his penalty against the post, an entire nation finally drew breath and erupted in celebrated.VIDEO Scroll down Jhendelyn Núñez flashes her Chilean bra after Sanchez scores

Brazil won 3-2 on penalties

The tension had been excruciating for
 players and fans up until that point in an almost-unbearable penalty 
shoot-out. Chile, who had until the penalties performed heroically, fell
 apart, scoring just two of their five with QPR reject Julio Cesar 
saving two.

But even Brazil struggled. Willian pulling one penalty lamely wide and Hulk allowing his to be saved Claudio Bravo.

To
 a nation and to Fifa’s relief, David Luiz and Marcelo proved true and 
then at the last it fell to Neymar. The burden seemed too much as he 
jinxed and hesitated in his run up - but then pulled the ball calmly to 
the right of Bravo to score what would turn out to be the winning 
penalty.

So amidst the celebrations, the performance could be forgotten. Timid and lacking in fluency, Brazil limped over the line.

Perhaps
 they will grow into a champion mentality with each hurdle they clear. 
Yesterday they created more chances than Chile but for long periods were
 out-thought tactically by a delightfully composed Chilean side, 
directed by Jorge Sampaoli.

In
 fact, they were lucky even to get to penalties. In the last minute of 
extra time, Maurico Pinilla exchanged passes with Alexis Sanchez and 
fairly thumped the ball of the cross bar, as Brazilians looked on aghast
 and bewildered.

That overpowering sense of expectation for a sixth world title mixed with a fevered outbreak of nationalism created an extraordinary entrance for the Brazil team with the stadium fairly shook as the din engulfed it throughout the spectacle.

The National Anthem increased the volume still further: even the mascots had their arms around each other and were bellowing it out.

On this occasion the players managed to repress their tears that have characterised previous games and led to fears that the occasion was overwhelming them. On a darker note, parts of the Chilean national anthem were obscured by a din of whistles: it’s not all Carnival and sunshine in Brazil.

Referee: Howard Webb (England)

Before the match, the most-heated 
discussions had surrounded the anticipated performance of Howard Webb, 
the Chileans fearing that referees here are under pressure to favour 
Brazil.

The Brazilians in turn countered that the Chileans were 
themselves putting Webb under pressure not to award them tight 
decisions.

And the 
Yorkshireman was soon put to the test, with Neymar playing in Hulk on 13
 minutes.

The Brazilian forward, in the penalty area, raced towards goal
 but Mauricio Isla nicked the ball from between his legs.

Down went Hulk
 and the Mineirao Satdium roared in anctipation but Webb, correctly, 
waved away the appeals to howls of anguish.

They
 need not have protested quite so fervently. Within five minutes they 
were ahead from a bog-standard set piece.

Neymar drilled in a corner, 
Thiago Silva angled the flick on to the far post and though David Luiz 
was there to direct it home, it was actually the out-stretched leg of 
Eugenio Jara who diverted it into the net.

Luiz wasn’t waiting for a 
dubious goals’ panel to deliberate, racing away accepting the adoration 
of the crowd and team-mates. At that stage, it looked to be a long 
afternoon for the Chileans.

Yet
 Brazil have been a strange mixture at this World Cup; at times they 
play with real verve and incision; but they can also look an anxious 
group of young men, unsure whether they can bear the weight of 
expectation. Equally, Chile have been one the joys of the tournament, 
playing some of the best football.

And
 with Brazil reverting to their tentative demeanour and Chile refusing 
to be cowed, a small earthquake occurred in Belo Horizonte: Chile 
scored. The manner of the goal amply demonstrated Brazil’s nerves.

A 
Marcelo throw-in was sloppily touched back to him by Hulk; Eduardo 
Vargas nipped in and played it first time to Alexis Sanchez. The 
Liverpool target simply took one touch to control and a second to score 
with a fine finish from inside the box. In small pockets of the stadium,
 small red corners erupted and embraced each other. Yet everywhere else 
there was a stunned sense of disbelief.

Brazil
 would respond. Fred should have done better from close range when Isla 
did enough to encourage him to blaze a shot over rather than direct it 
goal-wards from close range; Dani Alves had an excellent strike well 
saved by Claudio Bravo; and Neymar clearly had the measure of Francisco 
Silva and Gary Medel, frequently out-running them.

But Chile also threatened with Sanchez playing in Charles Aranguiz on half time, forcing 
Julio Cesar to make a smart save.

Brazil
 attempted to regroup. Fernandinho, staring is first match at the 
tournament and replacing Tottenham’s Paulinho, sized up a shot on 48 
minutes. It flew just wide and the Manchester City midfield winced, yet 
it steadied the crowd somewhat. Brazil, it seemed, would surely put this
 right.

Still greater 
excitement ensued on 51 minutes, when Hulk raced on to a long ball, took
 it down and touched it past Bravo.

Belo Horizonte rejoiced but they had
 reckoned without the prying eyes of assistant ref Michael Mullarkey, 
who judged that Hulk had controlled the ball with both his shoulder and 
arm.

It was a tight decision, probably correct but predictably it had 
Luiz Felipe Scolari up off the bench and in a rage for much of the next 
five minutes.

The arrival of 
Jo brought an expression of fresh hope from the crowd that would 
bewilder Premier League audiences. And Chile it was who came closest to 
scoring on 65 minutes. Mauricio Isla played a great one-two with Arturo 
Vidal and then pulled the ball back for Aranguiz.

He struck with power 
from close range and if a nation could collectively gasp in premature 
horror, this was that moment. Only a superb reflex save from Julio Cesar
 prevented the national calamity.

Yet
 Chile were undeterred. Marcelo Diaz and Vidal in midfield were 
establishing a grip on the game and Sanchez was a lurking threat.

The 
Brazilians continued to chant and to sing but it was the football 
equivalent of whistling in the dark, for their team lacked the authority
 you might have expected.

As much was confirmed when Hulk delivered a 
perfect cross into the path of Jo, who, three yards out from goal and 
with just Bravo to beat, failed to make any contact with the ball.
