A missing cat survived a 1,700-mile journey while being trapped in the undercarriage of an inter-city train.

Polly spent two days trapped under the front carriage as the First Great Western train made a series of trips between London, the West Country and South Wales.

The tabby was only discovered after train manager Emily Mahoney-Smith heard meowing when the train stopped briefly on its way to Cornwall.

Nine lives: Polly had her leg amputated after surviving a 1,700-mile journey trapped under the train

The two-year-old cat is thought to have climbed on board the high-speed express near her home in Plymouth, Devon, before enduring the two-day journey without food and water.

She suffered a badly-broken leg during the ordeal, which later had to be amputated.

Vets said by the state of her injuries Polly may have been trapped for even longer.

Ms Mahoney-Smith, 33, said the cat could only have got into the sealed unit when the panels were removed for maintenance at the shunting depot near her home.

She said: 'She was in surprisingly 
good condition and her coat was very shiny, although she was incredibly 
smelly from her infected leg.

Polly's leg was so badly broken that vets had no choice but to amputate but she is now recovering

Polly was found on a First Great western train on the line from Penzance to London Paddington

'She was very friendly and when I made a couple of PA calls she could be heard purring in the background.

'It's amazing how she survived for so long - I think she climbed into the train as she was after rats in the shunting yard.'

Polly disappeared from her home three weeks ago before finding herself locked inside the train.

The 06.51 service from Plymouth to 
London Paddington set off on Thursday, January 10, and then travelled from
the capital to Swansea.

It then headed back to Paddington later in the day before ending the day in Bristol via Westbury, Wiltshire.

The
following day the same train went back to Paddington via Worcester and 
Oxford before completing another run to Swansea and back to London.

Finally it left Paddington at 19.03 on Friday heading for Penzance in Cornwall nearly six hours away.

Polly was eventually found late on Friday evening when Ms  Mahoney-Smith heard the distressed cat.

Ms  Mahoney-Smith said she first thought the noise was a fault with the air suspension and went onto platform to check.

She saw no sign of the cat and the train carried on into the night but she heard the meowing again at the next stop at Saltash.

The
train could only wait temporarily there because part of it was on the 
Tamar Bridge but at the next station at St. Germans Emily and the driver
got out where they pinpointed the noise and were able to pull her out.

Ms  Mahoney-Smithtook her on board and fed her tuna from a sandwich from the train's buffet and put her in a box in her compartment before calling the RSPCA.

On-call vet Matthew Berriman said the cat was in such a bad state that he thought she was a stray and was preparing to put her down.

However he checked for a microchip and found that she belonged to retired train driver Arthur Westington, 84, and his wife Louisa, 82, who gave permission for Polly's front right paw to be amputated.

The cat is now recovering from her ordeal and 
operation at the Rosevean Veterinary Centre in Penzance and is expected 
to return home with a few days.

Mr Berriman said Polly could have been trapped for even longer because the fracture to her leg was 'easily four or five days' old'.

Mrs Westington said: 'Polly dashed out of the back door and we thought she'd gone for good.

'We missed her and were very surprised when the cattery rang to say she'd been found and was in Penzance.

'She's
lost her front paw and is now on antibiotics and resting but we can't 
wait to have her back - she's certainly seen more of the country than we
have.'

Train operators First Great Western added: 'We're pretty sure the cat had been stuck on board for some time.

'It was ensconced in the underbelly of the train and it couldn't have got in there unless the train was in a depot or static for a considerable period of time.

'That part of the train isn't accessible from a normal station stop so the latest it could realistically have stowed away would have been at Plymouth where it started service.

'We've calculated it did at least 1,667 miles but luckily we managed to get it to a vet and it's going to have a happy ending by going home.'
