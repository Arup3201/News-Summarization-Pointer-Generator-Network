There is no question: the Capital One Cup has been a more exciting competition to watch over the last three years than its more glamorous older brother, and is immediately throwing up talking points left, right and centre.

Here, Sportsmail takes a look at five ties to keep an eye out for in the first round for a variety of reasons.

MK Dons vs AFC Wimbledon

It may be a decade since the birth of MK Dons – obviously coinciding with the dramatic fall of Wimbledon - but this remains a bitter clash. So much so that the away supporters are refusing to spend a single penny inside stadium:MK such is their overt loathing for Pete Winkelman’s club and are planning on eating at a nearby IKEA before the game.

The Swedish store does do a mean meatball, in fairness.

Winkelman, meanwhile, refused to call the Dons by their proper name in a recent interview, merely referring to the League Two side as ‘AFC’. 

Not happy: AFC Wimbledon supporters hold up placards during their game at MK Dons in December 2012 

Invasion: Away supporters celebrate at stadium:MK but Karl Robinson's side scored an added-time winner

Brighton vs Cheltenham

This is a big evening for Sami Hyypia. Even though we’re only in the first week of the season, the former Bayer Leverkusen boss has failed to win 13 of his last 18 as a manager.

That includes the rather peculiar home defeat against Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday – his first in charge – and Hyypia needs to get off the mark quickly.

Albion, after all, weren’t too far away from reaching the Premier League last season. A loss to Mark Yates’ Cheltenham wouldn’t be disastrous in the grand scheme of things but it certainly wouldn’t help the new boss in the short term.

Big evening: Sami Hyypia wants to get himself a first win as Brighton boss since taking over this summer 

Shrewsbury Town vs Blackpool

This will hereby be known as the Matt Williams derby. The Seasiders lost their club secretary to the League Two side during the summer after Williams wasn’t given a justified pay rise and change in title by chairman Karl Oyston. He subsequently moved to Shropshire as chief executive – a role he was performing at Bloomfield Road without the grand title.

Williams moving on has been to the Seasiders’ detriment; he signed most of the players and sorted their registrations – something new secretary Chris Hough has staggeringly failed to manage as Jose Riga revealed he had just nine (nine!) players available on the morning of their first game against Nottingham Forest.

Former Pool players Scott Vernon, Mark Halstead and James Caton could also line-up for the Shrews.

How many? Blackpool had just nine players registered on the morning of their game away at Nottingham Forest

Leeds vs Accrington Stanley

Dave Hockaday is thought to be a touch out of his depth as a manager of a Championship outfit. Even owner Massimo Cellino said as much when talking to Sportsmail last week. Disparaging is probably the word to go for. ‘Don’t forget where he came from; league five. He’s like a baby, who is in a toy shop.’

Oh. Well, Hockaday lost his first game in charge at Millwall on Saturday, with Accrington posing a more familiar challenge given the boss’s previous experience at Forest Green Rovers. Saying that, Accy have been in the Football League since 2006. Big night for Dave, eh?

You don't know what you're doing! Leeds owner Massimo Cellino (right) doesn't fully trust Dave Hockaday

York vs Doncaster

This should be a little bit lively. Bootham Crescent is heaped in nostalgia that radiates through the rickety old stands; it’s a ground that can create a brilliant atmosphere. It has the semblance of a Yorkshire derby, albeit a minor one.

Nigel Worthington’s side lost away at Rovers on penalties in this round last year so they’ll be out for a bit of revenge.
