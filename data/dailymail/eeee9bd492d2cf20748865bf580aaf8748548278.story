Crystal Palace are closing in on the signing of Jordon Mutch after agreeing to pay up to £5.75million for the midfielder.

The 23-year-old has failed to make an impact Queens Park Rangers since his move in the summer and has been freed to leave by manager Harry Redknapp.

And Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew has moved quickly to land Mutch ahead of next week's transfer deadline.

The Eagles have agreed a £4.75m fee rising to £5.75m with add-ons.

Palace are also trying to complete a move for Newcastle striker Shola Ameobi, but face late competition from QPR.

Ameobi held talks with Palace on Tuesday as Pardew looks to reunite himself with the experienced centre-forward.

Palace have allowed midfielder Stuart O'Keefe to join Cardiff.
