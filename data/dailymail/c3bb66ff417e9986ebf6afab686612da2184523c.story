Career criminal Noel 'Razor' Smith, who has 58 convictions and spent 32 years in prison, believes the current system is failing 

Are prisons working?

At a time of high re-offending rates, a surge in violence and suicides and a steady rise in prison populations, many have suggested Britain's prisons are in crisis.

Career criminal Noel 'Razor' Smith, who has 58 convictions and spent 32 years in prison is well-placed to comment on the issue.

The grandfather-of-six was first arrested aged 14 for stealing apples. From there he 'threw himself into a life of crime' becoming a professional robber and committing more than 200 bank robberies.

As he described it: 'I loved being a criminal, it was a buzz being out there on the sharp end, gun in hand, masked and taking the prize.'

Smith spent time inside 34 different prisons, including the notoriously tough Whitemoor where he was locked up with infamous murderers such as police killer Harry Roberts, who was released last November after 48 years behind bars.

He was also imprisoned at Belmarsh where he struck up an unlikely friendship with shamed MP Jonathan Aitken and took him under his wing – or as he said 'I stopped some of the others stripping him down naked and humiliating him.'

He finally turned away from a life of crime after spending five years at HMP Grendon, a voluntary prison that provides a regime of therapy.

Having spent the majority of his adult life in prison, he believes the current system is failing.

He said: 'I would raise it to the ground and start again. The problem is they are not rehabilitating anyone in prison at the moment.

'Prison should only be for the very dangerous, which is about 5,000 to 6,000 people of the 89,000-odd people in prison. As it is, there are people being locked up who don't need to be there taking up spaces and wasting money.

'For example many people go to prison who have drink and drug problems, but they are not a danger to the public and they should be dealt with in hospitals. Similarly about 15 per cent of prisoners are homeless and it's often not their fault they end up in prison.

'But the policy at the moment is to send everyone to prison. They want to build new prisons but that sends out the message they want to invest in the future criminality of our children. They should be looking at reducing the number of prison populations.'

The seasoned criminal said the way to reduce the re-offending problem is to give prisoners proper vocational and educational training as an incentive to move on with their life after prison.

At present, 46 per cent of adults are re-convicted within one year of release.

'There is such a high re-offending rate because in prison people do nothing with you. Most of the recent violence and disturbance has been because there's no work and prisoners are locked up for 23 hours a day.

'If I was in charge I would make sure prisoners had vocational training and some form of education, so they have something to do when they get out of prison. Lots of people come in to prison without being able to read and write and when they are released that is still the case. That isn't right.

'Also when people leave prison there is no after care and they are given £46 which is expected to last them for four to five weeks.

'It is a culture shock for people coming out who have served long sentences. It's a great feeling of relief when you are released but after a few weeks it can be depressing and you're left on your own.'

He believes the use of therapy at Grendon is the most successful way of preventing prisoners from spiralling back into a life of crime. Grendon is the prison with the lowest re-conviction rate in the UK.

Smith in the early 1980s with his son Joseph, who was found hanged in an alley - following his son's death, he applied to HMP Grendon and believed the therapy at the prison helped him turn away from a life of crime

Smith decided to apply for Grendon after his 19-year-old son Joseph hanged himself.

At that time he was in Whitemoor prison and had become an 'elite career criminal' surrounded by high profile 'lifers'.

But because he was deemed such a danger to the public, he was prevented from attending the funeral and felt he had let his family down.

It was at that moment, he started to look for rehabilitation and moved to Grendon, where he spent the next five years.

He said: 'Grendon works because it treats people's problems unlike the other prisons when the prisoners are just locked away. They treat people with respect and there was a programme of therapy every day. The main thing they tried to instil in you was victim empathy.'

But what of the argument that a tough approach should help put prisoners back on the straight and narrow? Surely if prison is a tough and inhospitable regime, convicts will be determined to never re-offend?

Smith disagrees. 'My first experience of prison was in the 1970s when I was put in a 'shock' detention centre for those under 17. They decided that the way to stop young people re-offending was to brutalise them so badly they never wanted to go back to being a prisoner.

'This tactic may have worked if it was used for about 10 days, but I had it for six months which just made me think not to respect authority.

'It is similar problem nowadays where they are making sentences longer and longer, which removes the shock factor. People can get used to anything as it becomes the norm. It's terrifying for about four or five weeks.'

Smith also takes a somewhat controversial stance when it comes to drugs in prisons – a problem common to all UK prisons.

He is sceptical about the policy of mandatory testing, introduced by Michael Howard in 1995.

He believes the testing - while initially helping to tackle the problem - in the long-term has meant more prisoners now take heroin instead of cannabis.

He said: 'When the testing came in, people started taking heroin because it got out of the bloodstream much quicker.

'After a test people also knew they had a clear run of days when they could use it without being caught.'

He also explained how prisoners found ways to avoid being tested positive, such as drinking three litres of water before a test to flush the drug away from their bloodstream or keeping a little bag of urine down their trousers.

When he was locked up in Whitemoor prison, Smith forged a relationship with Jonathan Aitken, so what is his view of another high profile criminal, Ched Evans' efforts to return to football?

Despite stressing the importance of prisoners getting back into work, he does not believe Evans deserves his return to the game. His planned move to Oldham fell through this week following threats to the club's 'staff and families'. 

'Prisoners aren't allowed out of jail unless they do re-offending courses. Part of the re-offending process is admitting to the crime you have committed and knowing you have done wrong.

'Ched Evans has served half his sentence and still shows no remorse for what he has done. He may think he is not guilty but as it stands he is still a convicted rapist and what's to stop him doing it again?'

- Between 1993 and 2012, the prison population in England and Wales more than doubled: rising from 41,800 to over 86,000.

- Prison has a very poor record for reducing re-offending – 46 per cent of adults are reconvicted within one year of release.

- Overcrowding is getting steadily worse: 77 of 119 prisons in England and Wales are now overcrowded.

- In 2000 there were 2.9 prisoners for each prison officer, but by 2013, it had increased to 4.8 prisoners for each prison officer.

- The National Offender Management Service, the agency responsible for running prisons, has to make savings of almost 25 per cent by 2014-15.

- In 2012, 47 per cent of prisoners reported they had no qualifications, and 15 per cent reported being homeless before custody.

- In the last 20 months, 125 prisoners have killed themselves in British prisons.
