Freddie Starr (pictured in 2011) has been arrested for a second time by detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile sex scandal

Comedian Freddie Starr has been arrested for a second time by detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile sex scandal.

The entertainer, 70, answered bail yesterday and was rearrested over further allegations of sexual offences.

His detention came after he was first arrested in November last year over claims he tried to grope a woman when she was 14.

Scotland Yard said that a man had been ‘further arrested on suspicion of sexual offences in connection with further allegations made to Operation Yewtree’.

The investigation is the national inquiry sparked after allegations of abuse were made against Jimmy Savile.

It has been split into three strands - allegations against Savile, those against Savile and others, and those against others.

Starr was originally arrested under the ‘Savile and others’ strand, but the re-arrest was not linked to Savile.

He has denied any wrongdoing.

His detention for the second time follows the arrests of pop star Gary Glitter, DJ Dave Lee Travis, publicist Max Clifford, comedian Jim Davidson and entertainer Rolf Harris.

Starr, Travis, Mr Clifford and Davidson have all publicly denied any wrong-doing and gave statements after their arrests.

Harris’ lawyers at London law firm Harbottle & Lewis attempted to stop details of his arrest becoming widely known by sending threatening letters to newspapers.

But last week he was identified by The Sun as having been arrested by Yewtree officers.

Critics say Yewtree, set up in the aftermath of the Savile scandal, has turned into a ‘celebrity witch-hunt’ and police are arresting suspects on flimsy evidence.

Starr, who was first arrested in November, weeks after the Savile scandal erupted, has complained about his treatment.

He was taken into custody near his home in Warwickshire and questioned over claims he tried to grope a woman called Karin Ward when she was 14.

Ward, who waived her right to anonymity, claimed Starr had had a ‘very bad attack of wandering hands’ with her nearly 40 years ago. He vehemently denied her claims.

It prompted Starr to seek an injunction to prevent the claims being aired, but his High Court application was rejected.

He initially denied ever meeting his accuser, or appearing with her on Savile’s 1974 BBC show Clunk Click, but footage later emerged of him and Miss Ward in the same shot.

The comedian has claimed he has lost £1million in earnings from cancelled shows.

After police raided his home and seized a computer hard-drive, address books, photographs and his iPhone, Starr said: ‘It’s horrible. I’m being made to feel like a criminal.

‘I’ve never ever been in trouble before and I haven’t got a police record.

‘It’s heartbreaking and it’s affecting my health and everything. It’s unbelievable. I’m absolutely drained.’
