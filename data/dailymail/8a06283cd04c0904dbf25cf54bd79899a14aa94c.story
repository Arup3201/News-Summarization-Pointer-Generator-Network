Labour's flagship immigration policy to force firms to take on British apprentices unravelled within hours today, as it emerged the jobs will be open to anyone from within the EU.

To much fanfare Ed Miliband unveiled the plan to compel large firms who bring in skilled foreign workers to also 'train up someone who is a local worker'.

Despite efforts to woo business leaders to back Labour's reforms, industry groups lined up to slam the 'apprentice tax' which they warned would create a raft of 'daft' new red-tape at a time when firms were struggling to stay afloat.

Mr Miliband said he wanted to reduce low-skill immigration and insisted the party was committed to introducing an immigration bill in its first year of office.

He said Labour would force firms to train a British apprentice for every non-EU overseas worker they bring to the UK to help create a 'high wage economy' and ease the cost of living 'crisis'.

'Any firm that wants to bring in a foreign worker from outside the EU will also have to train up someone who is a localworker,' Mr Miliband told the Sunday Mirror.

But it emerged that under EU law it is illegal to block other Europeans from apply for jobs, including apprenticeships, in the UK.

With youth unemployment running at 50 per cent in Spain and millions out of work across the continent, a two-year placement with high-skilled British employers would be an attractive prospect for many from overseas.

Tory skills minister Matthew Hancock said: 'I have been advised by Government lawyers that legislating to require hiring British apprentices would be contrary to EU law.'

Tory Education Secretary Michael Gove said: 'This policy was meant to be the centrepiece of Ed Miliband's conference - and it's turned into a shambles.

'If he can't get this right - how can he ever be trusted to run the country?'

Labour sources stressed that the vast majority of apprentices in Britain are British, with most taking up posts near to where they live.

Pledge: Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna said firms should hire British apprenticeships as well as foreign workers

Under the Labour plan all firms with more than 50 employees will have to train an apprentice for every worker they hire from outside the European Union.

It is claimed it could create up to 125,000 apprenticeships over five years.

Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said it was proof Labour have learnt from their mistakes on immigration.

A new Ipsos Mori poll shows only 19 per cent of voters think Labour has the right policies on asylum and immigration.

Mr Umunna admitted that while in government Labour were sometimes worried that dealing with immigration involved issues of race.

He said it was important that companies train British people in the skills firms need.

Mr Umunna added: ‘I think we acknowledge that we didn't get everything right in government in respect of immigration.

‘To start with we were too afraid of talking about it because sometimes people were worried that that involved issues of race.

‘But I don't think it is racist to worry about how immigration impacts on our economy and the opportunities for our young people and what you've seen today is the Labour Party showing that we've listened, we've learned from some of our mistakes and we're determined to ensure that we've got an economy that works for working families.’

But the policy has raised fears of a short-term skills back if firms are discouraged from taking on high-skilled foreign workers.

John Longworth, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: 'This is an "apprentice tax" on employers and job creation.

'It serves neither to control immigration, where we should have a points system linked more strongly to economic benefit, nor young people, who should be encouraged and properly supported rather than being used to control immigration by other means.'

Simon Walker, Director General of the Institute of Directors, said: 'Several of Labour's proposals are completely removed from reality and betray the fact that their authors can have had no experience of running a business.

'Compelling companies to take on an apprentice for every non EU employee is a daft policy which would damage many small and medium sized businesses just as they are starting to grow.'

Pressure: Ed Miliband announced that all firms bringing in skilled staff from outside Europe should be forced to take on an equal number of ¿local¿ apprentices

Mr Miliband arrived in Brighton with the party's poll lead dwindling and internal critics warning he has failed to set out a clear strategy for the 2015 general election.

A total of 38 per cent of voters say the Tories have the right policies on the economy, almost double the 20 per cent who back Labour.

Mr Miliband’s party has also been rocked by the reopening of old wounds with the publication of disgraced Gordon Brown spin doctor Damian McBride's insider account of vicious party in-fighting.
