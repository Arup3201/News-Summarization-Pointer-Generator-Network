A
disabled grandmother has been left distraught after ‘rude’ nurses failed to
offer her a shower or hair wash throughout her two week stay in hospital –
where she also contracted superbug MRSA.

Dorothy Middleton, aged 77, has been left in fear of returning to hospital
following the shocking treatment which her family have labelled ‘absolutely atrocious’.

Her daughter Dorothy Snowden, aged 54, made the claims
against Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield, West Yorkshire where she was
initially admitted for shoulder pain on June 12.

The Daily Mail has routinely highlighted the scandalous
treatment of the frail and aged as part of its long-running Dignity for the Elderly
campaign.

Mrs Snowden said: ‘It was absolutely atrocious how she has
been treated.

‘There is no patient care in that hospital.’

Mrs Middleton is partially paralysed following a stroke 20
years ago and also suffers from diabetes.

Mrs Snowden claimed her mother was not once offered a shower
or hair wash and nurses banged her knee against a bed rail, but when the  grandmother complained she was told by nurses that it was arthritis.

Although scans were taken of the pensioner’s stomach, knee
and hip, her daughter claims the shoulder pain was not investigated.

She was also asked to bring her mother’s insulin from home
because staff were unable to access any in the hospital.

Mrs Snowden added: ‘On one occasion my mum asked for a bed
pan and when she rang the buzzer the nurse came in and said “what do you want”
and when mum said she wanted a bed pan the nurse said “what again?”.

‘I’m absolutely gobsmacked they can treat patients like
this.

‘When she was discharged we were told she had MRSA but she
didn’t have it when she was admitted and the staff said she’d got it there.

‘The discharge sheet also said she had no pressure sores but
she has some on her back and in her groin which is infected.’

The grandmother said: ‘Some of the nurses didn’t even sit me
up to have my meal and you can’t lie down to eat.’

On the day of Mrs Middleton’s discharge, Mrs Snowdon spoke
to the ward sister who she said apologised for the level of patient care and
admitted that the pensioner had not been offered a wash during her stay.

Mrs Snowden said: ‘We have to do something because there is
going to be another patient in that bed and another, until someone does
something about it nothing will change at the hospital.

Dorothy Snowdon said the ward nurses apologised for the lack of care her mother received during her two-week stay at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield, Yorkshire

‘My mum hasn’t been at all well since coming out of hospital
but she doesn’t want to go back there.’

Tracey McErlain-Burns, chief nurse at the Mid Yorkshire
Hospitals NHS Trust said: ‘All complaints and expressions of concern are taken
seriously and arrangements are in place for matron to meet with the family to
answer questions and provide an explanation.

‘Following that meeting I am confident that matron will take
the necessary steps to ensure that any lessons are learnt.’

The Daily Mail’s Dignity for the Elderly Campaign has
pressed for better standards in hospitals and care homes since 2002.

The campaign also highlights deepening public anger over the
way elderly people who have worked and saved all their lives are stripped of
their homes to pay care bills of several hundred pounds a week.

Last month the Daily Mail and the Big Lottery Fund awarded
more than £6million to charities and organisations helping to improve the lives
of older people, as part of a joint initiative known as the Silver Dreams Fund.
