A family were left devastated when their new puppy was taken from them and placed into quarantine after he was discovered to be an illegal immigrant with a fake passport.

Little Milo had only been living with the Donkin family for three weeks when trading standards officers arrived to take him away.

The five-month-old white Maltese Terrier was one of ten puppies imported illegally from Holland.

During a trip to the vets, Eleanor was told Milo hadn't had the right injections and that his passport looked false

The family had no idea there was anything wrong until they took the dog for a routine check-up and a vet noticed his passport looked false.

Trading Standards officers were contacted and Milo was taken into quarantine, much to the despair of Eleanor, 16, who had convinced her mother Carolyn, 48, to buy the dog.

Eleanor, from Hexham, Northumberland, said: 'I didn't think we would be coming home with a puppy but as soon as I saw him my heart melted.

'We'd spotted him for sale online and met up with the seller to have a tentative look.

'He was the last boy puppy left, and as soon as I saw him I knew I had to have him.

'We had no idea that there was anything wrong with Milo. He was such a loveable perfect puppy and I was so happy to have him in my life.'

Three weeks after Milo was taken, he was reunited with his family with all his jabs up-to-date

But sadly his brother and sister were not so lucky and had to be put down

'I couldn't imagine life without my little ball of fur': Eleanor's family were forced to spend nearly £500 on Milo's quarantine after it was discovered that he had been illegally smuggled into the country from the Netherlands

Milo and his siblings were sold by John Graham, a furniture salesman from Newbiggin-by-the-Sea, who brought them to England without their rabies injections, selling them off to unsuspecting families across the North East

During a trip to the veterinary 
surgery, Eleanor was told Milo hadn't had the right injections and that 
his passport looked false..

She was told to contact trading standards, who then ordered the dog to be quarantined costing £490.

She said: 'I didn't consider for a second that it was anything wrong with him. They said he might have to be put down.

'I didn't want anyone to take Milo away from me but I knew I had to protect mum and I too.

'The day that trading standards came to take him away I made the man promise that I would get him back,' she added.

Milo jumps for joy

Pet owners bringing their dog, cat or ferret into the UK are able to do so without placing it in quarantine so long as they meet the rules of the Pet Travel Scheme.

This requires pets travelling in to or returning to the UK from an EU or non-EU listed country to have a microchip, a rabies vaccination, a pet passport or official third country veteninary certificate and tapeworm treatment (for dogs only).

The owner must also be an authorised carrier and on an approved route.

Those travelling from an 'unlisted' country however must ensure their pet has a microchip, a rabies vaccination, a blood test, an official third country veterinary certificate and tapeworm treatment (for dogs only).

Again, those transporting the pet must be an authorised carrier and taking an approved route.

Puppy smuggler Graham pleaded guilty at Bedlington Magistrates' Court to importing puppies into the UK from Holland in breach of the Rabies Order 1974

The puppies were sold by John Graham, a furniture salesman from Newbiggin-by-the-Sea, who brought them to England without their rabies injections, selling them off to unsuspecting families across the North East region.

Graham pleaded guilty at Bedlington Magistrates' Court to importing puppies into the UK from Holland in breach of the Rabies Order 1974.

Three weeks after Milo was taken, he was reunited with his family with all his jabs up-to-date.

However, his brother and sister weren't so lucky and had to be put down.

Eleanor said: 'I couldn't imagine life without my little ball of fur. We are delighted to have him back.'
