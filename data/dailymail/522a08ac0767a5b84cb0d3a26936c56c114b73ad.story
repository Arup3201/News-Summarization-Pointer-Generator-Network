More Australians support same sex couples being allowed to get married than ever before and the numbers opposing the reform are dwindling, the latest statistics reveal.

Almost three quarters of Australians (72 per cent) now support legalising same sex marriage including 48 per cent expressing strong support for the change. While only a fifth (21 per cent) opposed it with those strongly opposed at a small and shrinking 14 per cent.

This overwhelming figure is the highest level of support and lowest percentage of opposition ever recorded on this question with support for same-sex marriage doubling since 2004 and still rising.

Mark Textor of Crosby|Textor said the results showed a clear and steady upward trend compared to other national telephone polls conducted over the last decade.

‘The fact that nearly three-quarters of Australians support allowing gay couples to marry is exciting in itself – rarely do you get such a clear-cut endorsement,’ he said. ‘But the really exciting part for me is the long-term trend; support rising steadily from just 38 per cent when Newspoll first posed the question a decade ago.’

The Crosby Textor telephone poll, commissioned on behalf of Marriage Equality Australia, was conducted in June and involved 1,000 randomly-selected Australian adults across the country.

Australian Marriage Equality national director Rodney Croome said the research will be used to work with the government who have yet to declare support for any reform to show them they have nothing to fear.

‘With Australians across all key demographics supporting marriage equality in record numbers, it's fair to say the public has made up its mind, the community debate is over, and it's time for politicians to act,’ he said.

“With Australians firmly behind marriage equality, it no longer needs to be a heated or divisive issue and can instead be one where people unite across the political spectrum to achieve reform.”

Mr Croome said it was significant to point out that support for marriage equality was now higher in Australia than in many other countries when they had achieved the reform.

A majority of those who identify with major religions supported marriage equality, including Catholics, Anglicans and non-Christian religions

Meanwhile politicians are echoing the support of the community.

Senator Leyonhjelm said an `it's time' factor was gaining momentum.

'The sky hasn't fallen in anywhere else (where) they've done it,' he said.

Independent senator Nick Xenophon said he supported same-sex marriage and called on the government to grant its MPs a conscience vote.

'Gays have every right to be as miserable as heterosexuals,' he said.

While Labor senator Lisa Singh said marriage equality was long overdue and parliament needed to reflect the wishes of the majority of Australians and support change.
