Ninety-three years after her grandmother hosted the first official party to mark the contribution of those in the armed forces, the Queen met servicemen and women at a special garden party today.

Soldiers aged in their 20s joined war veterans for the annual Not Forgotten Association’s (NFA) afternoon at Buckingham Palace.

Taking on a special significance in this centenary year of the First World War, the Queen, accompanied by her son the Duke of York, viewed a collection from King George’s war museum, charting the origins of the garden parties from WWI.

A letter of condolence sent from the Palace to the bereaved family of a soldier and images of the royals hosting veterans at the Palace during the war all feature as part of the collection.

Royal librarian Oliver Urquhart-Irvine said: 'It’s an extraordinary record of the Royal Family and Royal Household’s support for wounded servicemen after the First World War and that continues to this day.

'It is of course particularly fitting this year as we approach the centenary of World War One. The first official garden party, the idea of Queen Mary, was held in 1921, a year after the formation of the tri-service charity the NFA.

Today the Queen, dressed in an Ascot Tulip outfit by Angela Kelly, spoke with a number of injured servicemen, including Lance Corporal Sam Stoddart from Amesbury.

Injured in Afghanistan in 2012, the 22-year-old now has walks with the aid of a cane. He credited the NFA with providing him with opportunities to 'get away from it all'.

'I’ve been to Majorca on holiday, and to Wimbledon with them,' he said. 'It just helps you get away from your worries and problems back home.

'The Queen asked me about what had happened to me and you could tell she was genuinely interested.'

It was former member of the RAF William Mundy’s second garden party, and he said he considers it an important reminder to the public of the contribution made by members of the armed forces.

'It’s a great example to the general public that they express a keen interest in the armed services,' said the 93-year-old, who was a Japanese prisoner during the Second World War.

Ex-corporal Andy Reid, who now uses a wheelchair after stepping on an IED just 10 days before the end of a voluntary tour of Afghanistan five years ago, said the chance to meet up with old comrades and friends is invaluable.

'It’s a massive honour to be recognised here at the Palace for what has happened and the sacrifice we’ve made,' he said.

'I am grateful that I am still alive, I lost friends out there.

'This kind of event gives me the chance to mix with people who have been through similar things and that’s important, especially when you’ve gone back into civilian life,' said Mr Reid, who left the Army two years ago.

Acknowledged: The veterans said it was a massive honour to be recognised at the Palace for what has happened and the sacrifice they made all those years ago
