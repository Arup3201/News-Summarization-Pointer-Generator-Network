Late: Teenager Yasmin Tisbury has a hospital appointment booked for the year 2099

A teenager who tried to book a consultation at hospital was told to come back for an appointment in 84 years' time.

Yasmin Tisbury, 19, was referred for an ultrasound scan at Lister Hospital in Stevenage, Hertfordshire by her GP after complaining of stomach pains.

But a month later, she received a letter telling her she had an appointment at 11am on Thursday January 1, 2099.

The student will be 103 years old by the time she finally gets the scan - but as January 1 is a bank holiday, doctors may not even be working on that day.

Miss Tisbury was put on hold for an hour before she was able to speak to the hospital to sort out the IT blunder.

'I thought it was funny at first, I'm not sure I can wait 84 years for a scan,' said Miss Tisbury, who is studying animal management.

'But then I got quite annoyed while I was waiting on the phone.

'It's just a mix-up but I just wanted to get the date sorted. I have already had to wait a month to get the appointment and obviously I am worried about that.

'There wasn't even a clue when the appointment might be, because we are already in February so it would obviously not be in January.

'In fact I first thought the appointment was for next January but then I read what year they put.'

After tweeting about her bizarre experiences, Miss Tisbury was given a new appointment for next Tuesday.

But she said: 'The appointment they have given me is when I start my work experience, and I am unable to have time off, so I will have to rearrange again.'

East and North Herts NHS Trust said: 'We're very grateful to Yasmin for alerting us to this problem, which is clearly a clerical error.

'We know that sometimes our patients have to wait a few weeks for their appointments, but 2099 is stretching it somewhat.

'We've now agreed the details of her appointment with Yasmin directly - it will take place in a few days.'
