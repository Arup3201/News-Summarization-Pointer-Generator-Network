A new hotel inspired by photo sharing website Instasgram has opened its doors.

The unique boutique 1888 Hotel in Sydney, Australia has been designed with Instagram users in mind, meaning that every angle, every detail and every element of the hotel has been curated to be worthy of an Instagram photograph.

The hotel, who says of the property that 'every level has a view', encourages guests to take photographs of the furniture, rooms and views and post them on Instagram.

Those they judge to be the best can land the photographer a free night at 1888.

The space is certainly impressive. A giant digital photo frame hangs in the
 reception area with a revolving digital mural of Instagram images, and a
 'selfie' space to snap a photo of yourself as you check in - the best 
are displayed on the hotel's walls for others to see.

The five-storey hotel, named in homage to the year Kodak launched the first box and roll camera, is adorned with guest-shot Instagram photos, meaning guests who shoot a great picture can leave their own legacy behind.

Rooms start at £89 ($140) per night, although guests with more than 10,000 followers on Instagram are invited to stay for one night for free.

There is free wifi throughout, of course, and an iPad provided in each room for guest's use.

Guests also have a chance to win a free additional night’s stay through the 
hotel’s monthly photo competitions that award a free night's stay to the best snapper.

 Paul Fischman, the chief executive officer of hotel company 8Hotels, told Mashable, the social media news website, that the hotel caters to today's modern traveller.

'There
 has always been a strong, intrinsic link between travel and 
photography. But the advent of social media and Instagram has made 
photo-sharing an even bigger part of the traveller's experience.

'People
 not only want to visit and stay in beautiful places, they also want to 
capture and share it with their friends and networks as it happens.'

The hotel hopes guests will share their stay on Instagram - providing them with free publicity

Originally used for wool-storage, the building has undergone a £19 million development over the last two years.

The now luxury property boasts 90 rooms, including a rooftop penthouse apartment overlooking the city surrounds.

CEO of 8Hotels, Paul Fischmann says: '1888 Hotel has such an authentic contemporary aesthetic that we thought we should embrace the fact that all modern travellers can take memories away with them using their smartphones and share their experience with friends.'
