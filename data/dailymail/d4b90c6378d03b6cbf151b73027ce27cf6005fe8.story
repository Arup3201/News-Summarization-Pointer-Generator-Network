An undercover policeman planted a bomb in a department store to prove his commitment to animal rights extremists, an MP claimed yesterday.

Bob Lambert is accused of leaving an incendiary device in a Debenhams in London – one of three set off in a coordinated attack in 1987.

Caroline Lucas, leader of the Green Party, used parliamentary privilege to claim that Mr Lambert – who went under the alias Bob Robinson – carried out the attack after infiltrating the Animal Liberation Front.

The group planted the devices in protest at the store’s decision to sell fur products.

The attacks caused £8million of damage and led Debenhams to stop selling fur.

The claims were strongly denied by Mr 
Lambert, who is now a leading academic and expert in terrorism and 
Islamophobia at St Andrew’s University.

Following the July 1987 attacks on 
Debenhams, two activists – Geoff Sheppard and Andrew Clarke – were 
jailed for planting devices in the Luton and Romford stores.

Sheppard received a sentence of four 
years and four months, while Clarke was jailed for more than three 
years. The third activist involved was never caught.

Miss Lucas yesterday said she had seen
 a witness statement from Sheppard claiming the third man was Mr Lambert
 and that he targeted a store in Harrow.

She told MPs that Sheppard was not 
there when the bomb was planted. She read from his statement, which 
said: ‘I straightaway knew that Bob had carried out his part of the 
plan.

‘There’s absolutely no doubt in my 
mind whatsoever that Bob Lambert placed the incendiary device at the 
Debenhams store in Harrow.

‘I specifically remember him giving an
 explanation to me about how he had been able to place one of the 
devices in that store, but how he had not been able to place the second 
device.’

Infiltration: Bob Lambert was outed as an undercover police officer after Mark Kennedy was exposed

Miss Lucas alleged that when 
Sheppard’s flat was raided two months later while he was making four 
more fire-bombs, the intelligence was so accurate it ‘came from Bob 
Lambert’.

Calling for an inquiry into the 
activities of undercover officers, Miss Lucas told MPs: ‘It would seem 
that planting the third incendiary device was perhaps a move designed to
 bolster Lambert’s credibility and reinforce the impression of a genuine
 and dedicated activist.

‘There is no doubt in my mind that 
anyone planting an incendiary device in a department store is guilty of a
 very serious crime and should have charges brought against them.’

Mr Lambert said: ‘It was necessary to 
create the false impression that I was a committed animal rights 
extremist to gain intelligence so as to disrupt serious criminal 
conspiracies.

‘However, I did not commit serious crime such as planting an incendiary device at the Debenhams Harrow store.’

Mr Lambert infiltrated the Animal Liberation Front in the late 1980s and his evidence was used to convict Sheppard and Clarke.

He went on to become a police spymaster who led a network of undercover officers who infiltrated radical groups.

His cover was blown when Mark Kennedy, another officer who infiltrated a group of environmental activists, was exposed in 2010.

Mr Kennedy was later found to have had
 sex with two activists. Mr Lambert has also admitted to carrying out 
affairs while working undercover and fathered a child with one 
protester.

Eight women who say they were duped have begun legal action against the police.
