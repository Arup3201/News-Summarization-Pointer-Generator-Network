In what is one of the most severe illnesses of its kind, a baby girl born just 10 months ago is already the size of an average five-year-old because of a rare overgrowth disorder.

Indigo Nowakowsky-Kaiuha suffers from Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome that affects only one in 15,000 children. Indigo has blown up to a staggering 25kg, meaning she no longer fits into her car seat, requiring a custom one to be made.

The condition means that helpless child also suffers from a wide range of symptoms including restricted movement and breathing problems. She may also struggle to walk in the future.

Indigo was diagnosed at four months old, after her weight started ballooning suddenly.

When she was born, Indigo's health was seriously affected. The child had chronic fluid retention, a belly button hernia, enlarged organs and a heightened risk of cancer. 

‘They did some blood tests and found she has Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. We’re waiting for further tests to find out if it was genetic or random,’ said her mother Tiffany Nowakowsky-Kaiuha.

To make matters worse, Tiffany has suffered back injuries from looking after Indigo. The mounting financial burden of medical bills, clothing and caring for her daughter and her two other sons Shade, six, and Devon, four, is also putting huge pressure on the young family.

The fact she outgrows at a rapid rate, mean the family is struggling badly financially. 

‘The stress of not knowing if she will be able to walk or even crawl, the stress of the endless medical work and needing to buy new clothes all the time – it can be very overbearing,’ Tiffany said.

‘Between the size of Indies seat and her pram, I can’t fit anything else in the car. I need to get a babysitter every time I want to go shopping.

‘We’re on a very tight budget at the moment and really struggling to make ends meet.’

Doctors have told the family Indigo should start to 'level out' at about 8 years old, but Tiffany is doubtful she can support the family for that long such are her financial problems.

In a bid to get their heads above water, Tiffany has launched an online fundraising campaign called ‘Our Beautiful Indigo’.

‘We need help getting to hospital appointments, buying clothes for Indigo and helping the injuries I have suffered in my back from looking after her,' she said.

‘Every $1 is a big help. If a few people could donate just $1 that would make a big difference and would definitely help us in the long run!’
