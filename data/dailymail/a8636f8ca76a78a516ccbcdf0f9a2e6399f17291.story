Zinedine Zidane has been given the green light to continue coaching Real Madrid Castilla until the appeal against his three-month ban is heard.

The Frenchman was hit with a ban by the Spanish Football Federation's (RFEF) Appeals Commission on October 27 for coaching a professional side without a coaching licence.

Zidane, who worked under Real Madrid senior team boss Carlo Ancelotti at the Santiago Bernabeu before taking up the position at Castilla, has decided to appeal against the ruling.

Real Madrid expressed their 'absolute disagreement with the decision', arguing Zidane had been awarded the necessary licence by the French football federation (FFF), and said they would 'pursue every available legal avenue' to get it overturned.

Spain's Administrative Court for Sport (TAD) granted a precautionary suspension of the ban on Friday.

Zidane's assistant Santiago Sanchez has also been allowed to return to coaching action despite not having the required qualifications.

The duo will be allowed to take charge of Real Madrid Castilla's encounter against Rayo Vallecano B on Saturday.
