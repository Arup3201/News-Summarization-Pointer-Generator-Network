Plans to protect a statue of the Duke of Wellington from vandals who keep putting a traffic cone on its head have been withdrawn after thousands protested online.

The monument to the former Prime Minister in Glasgow is so frequently targeted by drunk students and other revellers that it more often sports a cone than not.

The city council this week announced plans to deter the vandalism, which is said to cost £10,000 to undo every year, by raising the statue to make it inaccessible.

Prank: The statue of the Duke of Wellington in Glasgow's Royal Exchange Square is frequently targeted by vandals who put traffic cones on its head

But some residents claim that the cone is itself a venerable city tradition, and a petition against the planned change attracted 10,000 signatures.

Now the council has backed down and cancelled the £65,000 refurbishment project in reponse to the public pressure.

The statue of the Duke, who is regarded as one of Britain's greatest ever generals after defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo, was erected in 1844 in Glasgow's Royal Exchange Square.

In the past few years it has become a magnet for pranksters, who place cones on Wellington's head as well as on that of his horse.

The practice has become iconic in some 
quarters, and in 2011 was named one of the 'top 10 most bizarre 
monuments on Earth' by the Lonely Planet guidebook.

Plan: Officials proposed raising the statue's plinth to prevent people from climbing on to it

However, the city council claims that it has to remove the cones at least 100 times a year, at a cost of £100 each time, and argues that the tradition casts Glasgow in a 'depressing' light.

The refurbishment would have raised the statue's plinth to 6ft, which would 'deter all but the most determined of vandals'.

The proposal was welcomed by Sandy Stoddart, the Queen's sculptor in Scotland, who told The Herald: 'Any move to end the tedious, unfunny, irreverent and strangely righteous addiction Glasgow has had to "coning" the Wellington statue I greet with warmth.

Outcry: 10,000 people denounced the plans this week; the statue is pictured last summerwith a cone which was painted gold in honour of Glasgow's successful Olympians

'The single most embarrassing thing about the culture of Glasgow has been the cone on the Duke's head. It is detestable.'

But
a petition set up by campaigners argued: 'The cone on Wellington's head
is an iconic part of Glasgow's heritage, and means far more to the 
people of Glasgow and to visitors than Wellington himself ever has.'

Glasgow's equestrian statue of the Duke of Wellington was sculpted by Italian artist Carlo Marochetti and erected in Royal Exchange Square in 1844.

It celebrates the great general's achievements in defeated Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, after which Wellington went on to become Prime Minister.

The statue stands in front of the city's Gallery of Modern Art in one of the most important public squares in Glasgow.

Around the early 1980s, pranksters - often including drunk students - began vandalising the statue by placing traffic cones on its heads.

While the city council has urged residents to avoid damaging the historic monument, some regard the practical joke as evidence of the city's unique sense of humour.

After the petition attracted 10,000 signatures, with another 45,000 people showing support on Facebook, the council announced that the plans were being withdrawn.

A council spokesman said today: 'The wording of the report was appalling and the leader of the council has instructed officers to withdraw the planning application.'

Campaigner Michael Gray organised a protest at the statue today, which was due to become a celebration after the council's decision.

'It's funny and cheers people up on their way to work and I think that's a good thing for the city,' he said. 'It's difficult to put a price on something like that.

'If they had raised it, I think someone would have just put it back on. It's already quite high so no matter how high it is, someone would just get a bigger ladder.'

Jennie Kermode wrote on the online petition: 'As a regular writer of tourist brochures, I note that much of what attracts visitors to Glasgow is the humour of its people. This is not something the council should be ashamed of.'

And Lara Davis added: 'The cone is more of a symbol of the defiant, fun spirit which Glasgow has always embodied and for which it's renowned throughout the world.'
