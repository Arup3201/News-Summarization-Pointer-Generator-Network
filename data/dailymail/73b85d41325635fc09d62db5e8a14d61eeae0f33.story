Agony: Jade Stevens from Shillington, Beds, who suffered a 'year-long hangover' until doctors finally discovered she had suffered a brain haemorrhage

A mother-of-two endured endured a 'year-long hangover' until doctors finally discovered she had suffered a brain haemorrhage.

Jade Stevens, 34, was tormented daily by crippling migraines which left her feeling listless and wobbly, as if she had been out clubbing the night before.

But despite the extent of her ordeal, doctors had insisted Ms Stevens had nothing to worry about until she was struck by a particularly extreme migraine which she said felt like an 'ice pick being stabbed through her head'.

But after she told them she was suffering 'the worst pain in my life', doctors discovered a mass of tangled veins and arteries in her brain which had burst under high pressure.

Her life was only saved by a marathon operation in which surgeons peeled back her scalp, cut a hole in her skull and removed the tangled lump of blood vessels.

Ms Stevens started suffering extreme headaches in late 2013, and after struggling for months finally visited a doctor who diagnosed migraines and prescribed strong painkillers.

Soon she was taking the pills every day. Then last November she was taking a shower after putting her children to sleep when she was struck with what experts call a 'thunderclap headache'.

She crawled to her bed, where she was discovered curled up by her partner, Clive Phillips, 39. He tried to persuade her to go to the hospital, but she initially refused because she was worried about her children.

But the next day she was taken to Bedford Hospital in an ambulance. Doctors initially diagnosed an extreme migraine, but ordered a CT scan after fed-up Ms Stevens insisted it was 'the worst pain in my life'.

After the scan revealed a bleed on Ms Stevens' brain, she was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, where brain specialists diagnosed arteriovenous malformation.

The rare condition causes a mass of tangled weak veins and arteries to form in the brain which are vulnerable to bursting when high pressure blood is pumped from the heart.

Describing her condition as like 'permanent hangover' Ms Stevens said each morning she would 'wake up feeling like I had come in from a club at 4am after drinking my bodyweight in alcohol.'

'I had a headache, but not the migraine type, I felt sick and generally sluggish and it almost felt like I was still a bit drunk from the night before. I would also feel quite un-coordinated and off balance,' she told South West News Service.

'Even before I woke up properly in the mornings I would reach across and take some tablets.

'The doctor said it looked like I was having migraines and I just took tablets, but I was having to take them every day in the end.

'But as soon as I had the CT scan after I went to hospital all of a sudden all hell broke loose.

'The doctor said to me "you've had a bleed on the brain" and I couldn't believe it.

'The operation to remove the mass was so scary - I didn't know if I was going to come out of the operation, and if I did, how much damage was going to be done.'

Scars: Surgeons peeled back Ms Stevens scalp before cutting a 5cm square in her skull to remove the tangled mass of arteries and veins which had developed there then burst - causing her agonising pain

In a risky, eight-hour operation, surgeons painstakingly peeled back Ms Stevens scalp and cut a 5cm square in her skull to remove the mass.

But that wasn't the end of her ordeal. She was temporarily blinded and even forgot how to read following the procedure, but has since suffered recovered her faculties and suffered no more headaches.

'It was the only way they could get rid of it completely.

'My vision when I first woke up was like I was underwater, but now it is not perfect but much better,' Ms Stevens said.

'I also lost my ability to read. I picked up a magazine and I looked at the letters and I couldn't read a word. It was like a foreign language.

'They think it was the swelling putting pressure on that part of the brain.

'I'm much better now, but I have to take longer words quite slowly.

'I feel very lucky. Normally when you have a bleed on the brain it causes lots of damage, but I was mostly fine.'
