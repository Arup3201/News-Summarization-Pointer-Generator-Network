Russia manager Fabio Capello launched a stinging attack on the referee after blaming his side's exit from the World Cup on a laser pen.

The former England boss claimed his goalkeeper was blinded by a green beam of light from the crowd just before conceding an equaliser from Algeria that knocked them out of the tournament.

A furious Capello declared 'all referees are against us' after rebuking the match officials for allowing the goal to stand.

Blinded: Capello says Russia goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev was blinded by a laser just before Algeria's goal

He said: 'I don't like to speak about referees, but every time it's against Russia!

‘Our goalkeeper was affected by a laser 10 seconds before the goal. He was blinded by a laser, there are photos, films of it.'

Islam
 Slimani's 60th-minute equalizer came after Russia goalkeeper Igor 
Akinfeev failed to catch a swinging left-foot free kick from Yacine 
Brahimi.

However, there
 were indications on the TV broadcast that a green laser was being shone
 toward the goalkeeper from someone in the crowd just before the free 
kick was taken.

Fuming: Russia manager Fabio Capello speaks to the referees after their 1-1 draw with Algeria

Discussion: Russia's failure to win cost them their place in the World Cup as Algeria progressed

Russia 
knew three points would be enough to make the last 16 but were held to a
 1-1 draw in their Group H finale, ending their World Cup campaign with 
just two goals and two points.

Capello,
 a man who previously experienced World Cup disappointment after 
managing England at the 2010 tournament, feels the referees have been 
against his team.

But Capello, under contract until 2018, will not quit as boss.

'I will continue to work for the Russian national
team, if they want me to continue,' he said.

Frustrated: Capello has taken charge of seven World Cup matches but has won just once

'I have done a good job. England went to the
knockout round in 2010 after failing to qualify for Euro 2008.

'Russia qualified
for the World Cup for the first time in 12 years.'

It was Capello's seventh World Cup match as a coach but the £6.6million-a-year manager has staggeringly only ever won once.

Russia
 took an early lead against Algeria, courtesy of a sixth-minute goal 
from Aleksandr Kokorin, but Algeria hit back through striker Islam 
Slimani with half an hour to go.
