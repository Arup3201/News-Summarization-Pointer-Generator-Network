When a party of storm-chasing tourists joined guide George Kourounis on the hunt for tornadoes, they were looking for the thrill of a lifetime.

And they got more than they bargained for when one formed right beside their minibus and hurled a heavy crop sprayer into the windscreen.

The group had been speeding along a lonely highway near the town of McCool, Nebraska, with ominous grey skies hanging over them, trying to reach a tornado they had spotted in the distance.

Portentous: George Kourounis and his group of storm-chasing tourists had been speeding down this isolated highway near the town of McCool, Nebraska, when they suddenly got a bigger thrill than they bargained for

It's as they pass the spindly arms of this crop duster that they realise a tornado is forming beside them

Quick thinking: Realising that the tornado is about to pass right over the minibus, Mr Kourounis takes evasive action, steering into the wind to stop the vehicle from being rolled over

Passengers in the minibus must have been horrified to see the incoming crop duster, headed straight for them

It hit the windscreen with a resounding crack, but the toughened glass held despite the heavy impact

Then, without warning, a second tornado began forming in the field next to them. Realising they would be foolish to stop and gawp, Mr Kourounis speeds up in an effort to drive to safety.

But with the twister heading straight over them, there's nothing for it but to take evasive action and they turn into the wind - as the storm throws the crop sprayer straight into the front of their minibus.

'I've got to admit it was pretty scary,' said Mr Kourounis. 'We were trying to drive away from a storm when a tornado formed beside the car from nowhere.

'I didn't really know what to do and had to try steer into the wind to prevent the car from flipping.'

He added: 'There was just no real opportunity to get out of its way. If we had been going a little slower or a little faster things could have been very different - we were lucky.'

Despite having just survived driving through a tornado, the damage to the minibus was actually pretty slight

Mr Kourounis, of Toronto, Canada, quit his engineering job to take up life as an adventurer 16 years ago. Each spring, he leads parties across the U.S. chasing tornadoes.

'The party had all paid to be on the storm chasing trip and I know a lot of them were scared but that's what they pay their money for,' he said.

'That's the beauty of storm chasing - it's unpredictable. You never know what's going to happen next.'
