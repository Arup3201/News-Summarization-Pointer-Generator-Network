Andrew Mitchell was forced to quit as chief whip over claims he called police 'plebs', something he always denied

Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood came under fire from MPs yesterday after admitting he had been ‘too busy’ to conduct a proper inquiry into the so-called ‘Plebgate’ incident.

David Cameron asked Britain’s top mandarin to investigate the affair last September, in which the former Tory chief whip swore at a policeman at the gates of Downing Street.

He was drafted in after an off-duty policeman claimed in an email to his local MP that he witnessed the incident and supported the allegations of two officers that Andrew Mitchell had been aggressive towards them and called them plebs.

Sir Jeremy admitted having suspicions that Mr Mitchell might have been the victim of a ‘gigantic conspiracy’ by the police but decided to do nothing about it.

And he admitted he had not even sought to ascertain whether Mr Mitchell used the word plebs, as police claimed. Sir Jeremy said he concluded the email was unreliable and there were ‘inconsistencies’ between the email and CCTV footage of the incident

But he didn’t bother to look at the police log, published as he began his inquiry, and said he ‘can’t recall’ whether a note by the Prime Minister’s principal private secretary, who interviewed the officers on duty, had contained the word pleb.

‘I didn’t look at whether the word pleb was used,’ he said. ‘I haven’t attempted to assess the veracity of the police account against the CCTV footage.’

Sir Jeremy said he was ‘mildly suspicious’ of the email but failed to uncover the truth.

Asked whether the police were guilty of a ‘massive fabrication’, he said: ‘We accepted there were unanswered questions including the possibility of a gigantic conspiracy. Those were unanswered questions.

‘But we decided, on balance, to let matters rest, decided to stick by Andrew Mitchell, keep him in post and move on.’ Sir Jeremy recommended that Mr Cameron support Mr Mitchell, but the crucial CCTV footage which might have exonerated the chief whip was not published until after Mr Mitchell had been forced to resign.

He left the Public Administration Committee astonished at his failure to probe apparent lies by diplomatic protection squad members.

Sir Jeremy sought to defend himself against the charge of incompetence by repeatedly saying it was ‘not in my remit’ to look at the police log.

He claimed: ‘It’s not my job to investigate the police. I don’t have the powers, I don’t have the expertise, I don’t have the time.’

He also admitted routinely ignoring public complaints about ministers. But MPs, including committee chairman Bernard Jenkin, told Sir Jeremy he should have referred the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission or Sir Alex Allan, who is supposed to probe ministerial wrongdoing.

A report by MPs, due out next week, is expected to condemn No10’s handling of the affair.

Mr Jenkin told Sir Jeremy: ‘You weren’t asked to get to the bottom of it, you didn’t think it was your obligation to get to the bottom of it and because of your failure to get to the bottom of it, the Government lost its chief whip.’

A friend of Mr Mitchell said: ‘For Heywood to say it wasn’t in his remit is risible. He’s the Cabinet Secretary. He tells Cameron what to do.’
