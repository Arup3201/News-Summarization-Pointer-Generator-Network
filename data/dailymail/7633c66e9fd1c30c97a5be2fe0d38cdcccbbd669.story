Martin Middleton, 26, pleaded guilty to a charge of causing an explosion at Bolton Crown Court yesterday and will be sentenced later this year

A man lost several fingers when a home-made pipe bomb exploded, causing the entire street to be evacuated.

Martin Middleton, 26, called 999 and was later picked up by paramedics after apparently fleeing the house he shares with his fiancee.

About 40 homes had to be evacuated after the explosion in Bolton, Greater Manchester, in January this year, while police and bomb disposal teams searched the area. His fiancee Kay Emerson escaped uninjured.

Previously, Middleton had posted a pencil drawing of a tattoo design
 that he wanted, depicting an exploding bomb with the word 'kaboom' in 
the middle, on his Facebook page.

But he told friends: 'mum wont let me have a pipe bomb on my arm i get it done'.

Middleton, from the Tonge Fold area of the town, yesterday pleaded guilty to causing an explosion likely
 to endanger life or injure property.

David Toal, defending, said: 'He 
acknowledges that there was some forseeability for harm, but there was 
no intention that is in the particulars.

'The defendant accepts that there wasn’t any intention on his behalf to endanger life.

'The defendant has pleaded guilty. Essentially there is no basis save for recklessness.'

The case has been adjourned until June
 14 for a pre-sentence report and a psychiatric report to be prepared. 
Middleton has been remanded in custody.

Judge Peter Davies told him: 'It is important that you co-operate with the preparation of the report.'

Middleton, who is expecting a baby with his fiancee,
admitted an offence under the Explosive 
Substances Act 1883.

Mr Toal added: 'I have spent some considerable time researching case authority for offences pursuant to section two of this act.

Before the accident in January this year, Middleton had posted a picture of an exploding bomb tattoo design he wanted, left, and a photo of facial burns, thought to be from a previous bomb, on social networking sites

'It is right to say there are no previous cases that can be found where factors relate to any similarity to the current case.

'Generally speaking they are far more serious than this case.'

It also emerged outside court that this may not have been the first time he had experimented with home-made explosives.

He is believed to have previously suffered serious facial burns after making a tennis ball bomb.

A source claimed he bragged to former work colleagues in South Wales.

One of them said: 'One of the boys at work found a picture of him on a search on the internet.

'He said he was using matches to make a tennis ball bomb and it blew up in his face.”

A comment on the pictures, apparently 
by Middleton, was written on social networking website Where Are You Now?, saying: 'Me
 a year ago not like that any more.'

Middleton is thought to have worked in South Wales, having lived in Aberdeen before that, between July and November last year.

The former colleague said: 'When he 
first came he was mouthy and full of confidence. He was a grafter for 
the first couple of weeks.

'But then he changed. He was a bit of a pain.

Police and bomb disposal teams attended the scene of the explosion back in January, pictured, where 40 homes had to be evacuated

'I am surprised he put a picture of his injuries on a social networking site - it is a strange thing to do.'

A neighbour said at the time of the blast: 'I am really shocked at what happened.

'His girlfriend is pregnant and I thought he was getting back on the straight and narrow.'
