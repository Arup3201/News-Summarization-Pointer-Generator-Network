Deportivo La Coruna and Malaga players held a minute's silence before Wednesday's cup tie to remember the fan who died during a violent brawl in Madrid.

Deportivo's Riazor Stadium was largely empty after the Spanish club banned their hardcore ultras from attending the Copa del Rey encounter following the death of supporter Francisco Javier Romero Taboad on Sunday.

The 43-year-old died after trouble erupted between rival groups in the streets surrounding the Vicente Calderon stadium ahead of Atletico Madrid's midday match against  Deportivo.

He died in hospital on Sunday afternoon after firefighters pulled him out of the Manzanares river near Atletico's home ground, while 12 more people were reported injured - some including stab wounds - during the fighting which was said to have involved around 200 people.

The Galician club will also hold a minute's silence in honour of Taboada, known as 'Jimmy', and have reduced tickets to Saturday's league game with Malaga to a euro.

'We want Saturday's game to be a demonstration against violence,' Club president Tino Fernandez said. 

'We want many of our citizens, who are against violence, to attend.

'We want to show everyone that we are united against violence and prove what is the true spirit of our supporters.

Some Deportivo fans will not be allowed in to the games for the next two weeks

'What happened on Sunday was tragic.' 

Atletico Madrid expelled seven club members on Tuesday and a radical group that Spanish police identified as having participated in a brutal fight with rival Deportivo fans that left one man dead.

'Among those identified are 15 people who say they are Atletico Madrid supporters, of which seven were club members ... those members have been expelled immediately,' Atletico said in a statement on its club website.

Atletico also said it is banning 'Atletico Front,' one of the radical groups identified by police as participating in Sunday’s street brawl, from its Vicente Calderon Stadium.
