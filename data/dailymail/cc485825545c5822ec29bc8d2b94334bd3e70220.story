Anna Friel has revealed she is thinking of having her eggs frozen

Anna Friel has revealed she is thinking of having her eggs frozen - for when boyfriend Rhys Ifans feels ready to face fatherhood.

The 36-year-old actress - who stars opposite Steve Coogan in the forthcoming film about porn baron Paul Raymond, The Look Of Love - already has a seven-year-old daughter Gracie from her 10 year relationship with Harry Potter star David Thewlis.

Friel has been dating Notting Hill star Rhys for two years, and told Easy Living magazine: 'I do want another child, but it’s not something I want to rush into at his point in my life with Rhys.

I think he would like his own child, but I’m not sure we’re ready yet.' 

She added: 'I’m 36. All my friends around me are freezing their eggs!

It’s so much harder to be a woman these days. We’ve got to do everything - keep working and cope with travelling, and still be a mother.'

The former Brookside star revealed she stays looking young by drinking juiced raw vegetables and berries every day, and having a procedure called a Vampire Facial, where blood cells are injected into the face.

But she admitted she does drink and Ifans loves to cook for her.
