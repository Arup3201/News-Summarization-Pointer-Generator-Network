A chicken farmer has been handed over £18,000 in compensation after his birds stopped laying eggs because they became terrified by low-flying Apache helicopters.

The farmer in the Sussex village of Ninfield received  £18,708 from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) after claiming his birds were so frightened by the loud noise of the helicopter that egg production fell.

The payout was just one of four last year made to poultry farmers who said that their chickens were so scared by military aircraft that they trampled one another death and that the survivors were so terrified by the noise, the stopped laying eggs.

It comes as figures released under the Freedom of Information Act showed that the MoD paid out a total of £1.1million in compensation due low flying incidents in 2014.

Payments were also made to people who lost horses, cows and puppies, which were also spooked by the noise of the military aircraft.

The figures also showed that the MoD sanctioned a payment of £25,000 to a falconry centre in Derbyshire which lost a number of precious birds of prey when a helicopter flew over it.

It is believed around eight birds including owls, hawks and falcons were killed in the incident when the terrified birds fatally injured themselves by flying full speed into the wire walls of the aviary trying to get away from the noise.  

Many of the compensation payouts come with confidentially agreements so that people agree not to disclose what they have been paid for.

Other payments included £42,700 for cows that died after being scared by a Puma helicopter in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, and £20,000 for an injured horse that lost its foal in a case in Dyfed, Wales.

The MoD also sanctioned £1,286 to repair a bus shelter in Worthy Down, Winchester, that was damaged by a low-flying Chinook helicopter and £2,590 after a Lynx helicopter damaged the roof of a home in Hungerford, Berkshire.

Often the biggest payouts are made to horse riders who suffer injuries when their animals bolt after being spooked by the military aircraft.

In the previous year the biggest payment was £83,125 to a person who suffered severe head injuries after being knocked over by a horse which had been scared by a Chinook helicopter.

Last year also saw £2,200 paid to owner of a parrot from Ayrshire which died after being scared by a Hercules transport plane, which flew over its owner’s home. 

There has also been compensation paid to members of a therapy group whose tranquillity was disturbed by the aircraft and the vet bills paid of a parrot which broke both its legs after being scared.

A MoD spokesperson said: 'Flying training is carried out across the UK to develop and practice the techniques needed on operations.

'The MOD treats all flying complaints seriously and while we have a responsibility to ensure that military aircrews are fully trained and prepared for operational duty, we continue to do all we can to minimise disturbance to the public.'

An MoD report said low-flying compensation claims required particularly careful monitoring to identify potentially fraudulent claims.

But a spokesman for the TaxPayers' Alliance said: 'Clearly many individuals across the country rely on livestock and animals for their livelihood, so it is right that compensation is paid out if the MoD has affected that.

'The level of spending though is shockingly high, and those responsible for errors in planning at the department must be held accountable.'
