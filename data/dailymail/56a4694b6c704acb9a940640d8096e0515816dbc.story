A frustrated Michael Moore, the liberal filmmaker who led cheers for Barack Obama before he ascended to the White House, said Tuesday that he would only be remembered as America's first black president – 'and that's it.'

Obama, he said during an interview at the Toronto Film Festival, has become a 'huge disappointment' by failing to bail out ailing cities like his hometown of Detroit. Michigan.

“When you start turning the water off in 150,000 homes because they haven’t paid the water bill?' he asked. 'You have that many people without water? You start turning the streetlights off so the city is dark at night? A large American city in pitch blackness?'

'Is this some sort of social experiment? – they're trying to see, "How far you can push the poor?"'

'Detroit at this point would stand a better chance if they were an Iraqi or Syrian city,' he claimed, 'in terms of getting some sort of help.'

Turning to the Hollywood Reporter's camera, he addressed the president directly.

'When the history is written of this era,' Moore said, 'this is how you’ll be remembered: "He was the first black president." Okay, not a bad accomplishment, but that's it. That's it, Mr. Obama.'

'A hundred years from now: "He was the first black American that got elected president." And that's it. Eight years of your life and that’s what people are going to remember.' 

'Boy, I got a feeling, knowing you,' the filmmaker scolded, 'that you'd probably wish you were remembered for a few other things, a few other things you could have done.'

'So, it is, on that level, a big disappointment.'

Moore has come out swinging against Obama before. In 2011, upset about the president's military campaign in Libya, he tore into the chief executive on Twitter.

'May I suggest a 50-mile evacuation zone around Obama's Nobel Peace Prize? #returnspolicy,' Moore tweeted.

Finincially unraveling Detroit, Moore snarked, would be better off if it were in Syria or Iraq because Obama would be paying attention to its inhabitants

 

Around the same time, he told the BBC that Obama's first term in office had been 'heartbreaking' for liberals. 

'He did not come into office like I had hoped that he would,' Moore said then, 'to do what [President] Franklin Roosevelt did in his first few months, where he came in and said, you know, "I'm in charge, this is the way we're doing things, if you don’t like it, throw me out of office".'

Moore was in Toronto for a 25th-anniversary screening of his first film, 'Roger & Me,' which focused on General Motors' CEO at the time, Roger Smith, whom he accused of raiding jobs and functionally destroying the Michigan town of Flint.

His other controversy-laden movies include Bowling for Columbine, Fahrenheit 9/11 and Capitalism: A Love Story.
