The Prime Minister has delivered a major shake-up as he announced his first ministerial reshuffle on Sunday afternoon, with a second woman promoted to Cabinet.

Tony Abbott has appointed Peter Dutton to immigration and shifted Scott Morrison to Minister for Social Services, while Sussan Ley will take on her role as Minister for Health and Sport.

Described as a 'significant reshuffle' by the Prime Minister, David Johnston has been dumped from cabinet with former Social Services Minister Kevin Andrews taking over the Defence Minister role.

Mr Abbott announced his new look in Canberra, saying it would 'reset and refocus the government for the coming year'.

'This is a ministry for jobs and families and it is a sign that this is a government which wants the economy and the budget to be front and centre in the coming year,' he told reporters in Canberra.

Josh Frydenberg will become assistant treasurer, replacing Arthur Sinodinos, whose resignation from the role triggered the reshuffle.

Mr Abbott said the education portfolio would now become education and training, with former parliamentary secretary Simon Birmingham named as an assistant minister to Christopher Pyne.

MINOR CHANGES

Kelly O'Dwyer also entered the outer ministry, becoming a parliamentary secretary to the treasurer.

'This is a good team. It is a strong team. It is a balanced team,' Mr Abbott said.

I am proud of all my colleagues but I am particularly proud to be able to make these announcements this afternoon.' 

Brett Mason has been dropped as parliamentary secretary for foreign affairs and the vacancy filled by Steve Ciobo.

Meanwhile, Industry Minister Ian Macfarlane will become the Minister for Industry and Science, rectifying an omission that has plagued the government.

Addressing the dumping of Senator Johnston, the prime minister said 'no one goes on forever'.

However, the resignation of Senator Sinodinos provided an opportunity to 'refresh and reset' the government.

'Just because someone leaves the government doesn't mean that he or she has done a poor job,' he said.

'Johnno did a fine job as defence minister and Brett Mason has done a good job in his role.'

Mr Andrews would be a 'very, very safe pair of hands' as defence minister.

'He will do an excellent job in this difficult and vital portfolio,' Mr Abbott said.

The prime minister also heaped praise on outgoing immigration minister Scott Morrison as a master of difficult policy and administration, who had all but stopped the boats.

As part of an expanded social services portfolio, Mr Morrison will have responsibility for child care and Mr Abbott's signature paid parental leave scheme.

'He is a very tough and competent political operator but he is also an extremely decent human being,' the prime minister said.

'We need good judgement in these areas and that is exactly what you will get from Scott Morrison.'

Rounding out Mr Abbott's reshuffle, Christian Porter, Bob Baldwin and Karen Andrews were all named parliamentary secretaries.

The new ministry will be sworn in on Tuesday.

Acting opposition leader Penny Wong said no reshuffle could fix the government's biggest problem - its an unpopular budget.

'You might change the tyres on the bus but the wheels are still spinning,' she told reporters in Adelaide.

'It is a vote of no confidence in the PM's cabinet. You don't need to have this extensive a reshuffle if your cabinet is performing well.'
