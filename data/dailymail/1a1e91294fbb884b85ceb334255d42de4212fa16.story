A petting zoo featuring light-up 'cyborg creatures' instead of the usual rabbits and miniature goats has opened in France.

The robotic animals have bright, flexible tentacles and react when touched, much like a living animal, as each arm has features and 'personalities' that change according to the activity of visitors.

The interactive exhibition, created by a British architecture and design studio, intends to make visitors question how future environments could enable new forms of communication.

A petting zoo featuring light-up 'cyborg creatures' instead of the usual rabbits and miniature goats has opened in France and invites humans to interact with the futuristic animals

Petting Zoo is the latest work by two brothers who make up the Minimaforms studio and is on show at the FRAC Centre in France.

Theodore and Stephen Spyropoulos designed the artificially-intelligent creatures with the capacity to learn and explore behaviours through interaction with participants, using Microsoft's Kinect sensors.

The animals show 'emotions' when touched by moving, lighting up and making sounds and evolve their behaviours over time, which the designers said allow the pets to develop their own 'personalities'.

Writing on the company's website, they said: 'Within this immersive installation 
interaction with the pets foster human curiosity, play, forging intimate
 exchanges that are emotive and evolving over time.

'Beyond technology the project explores new forms of enabled communication between people and their environment.'

As well as reacting to humans, the robots are also able to communicate with each other.

Internal patterns of observation allow the pets to synchronise movements and behavioural responses. Other technology lets the pets evolve relationships and avoid repetitive behaviour.

The robotic creatures are aware of humans thanks to camera tracking and data scanning technology.

Real-time camera streams are processed and coupled with 'blob tracking' and optical flow analysis to locate people and read their gestures.

If a person stays still and is not taking an interest in the pets in the environment, they can stimulate responses of disinterest and boredom in the animals.

Groups of humans can interact with the animals by the ability of the system to identify and map in real-time the number of people seeking attention.

Minimaforms was founded in 2002 by brothers Stephen and Theodore Spyropoulos as an experimental architecture and design practice.

The duo explore new forms of communication and aim to push the boundaries of art, architecture and design by constructing spaces of 'social and material interaction'.
