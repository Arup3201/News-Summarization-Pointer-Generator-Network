Getting married is a nerve-wracking experience for any couple - but for this adventurous pair, their wedding required even more bravery than unusual.

Renat Adykov and Maria Obryvalina decided to hold their nuptials underwater, even though neither had ever been scuba-diving before.

But the two lovebirds did not let their lack of experience hold them up - and the bride even wore a veil over her wetsuit for the big day.

Vows: The Russian couple used cue cards to exchange messages of love below the Libyan Sea

Brave: Neither Renat nor Maria had ever been scuba-diving before they decided to get married underwater

The couple, from Saransk in western Russia, had been together for two years before they got married earlier this month.

Renat, a 28-year-old marketing manager and amateur painter, had long admired Maria, also 28, who works in a travel agency.

He took six months to win her heart, and it was another six months before the couple first shared a kiss - but when they decided to get married they took a much less conservative attitude.

The pair won a competition to get married in at the Kalypso Dive Center in Crete - even though their hometown in 700 miles from the nearest coast.

Renat and Maria were given a day-long course in scuba-diving - and just two days later, they embarked on their underwater nuptials.

After a short ceremony on the shore, they plunged into the Libyan Sea and reached a specially built platform seven metres below the surface.

There they carried out a second ceremony, lasting 20 minutes, in which they exchanged their vows with the help of plastic cue cards.

'I think this is the first underwater wedding ever to take place in Crete,' said Greg James of the Kalypso Dive Center.

'In the wedding with them we had five divers, including photographers and the priest - who wasn't really a priest, he was actually the owner of our business.

'Maria was a bit nervous, but in the end she was absolutely fantastic.

'You don't have to be brave - the only thing they need to do is learn to put their face in the water, and learn that they can breathe underwater.'

After the success of their first wedding ceremony, the managers of the centre are keen to do more - pointing out the unique beauty of the underwater seascape.

Renat and Maria have now returned to Russia to start their new life together, saying they hope to have a son and daughter to add to the family soon.
