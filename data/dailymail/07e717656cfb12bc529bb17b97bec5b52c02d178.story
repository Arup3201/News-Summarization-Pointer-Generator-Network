Stewart Downing was playing left back for Liverpool when he got a call from the chief executive Ian Ayre in August last year.

‘West Ham have made an offer, we’ve agreed a fee and it’s up to you,’ is football code for one thing: pack your bags.

It is fair to say, after listening to Downing at England’s training centre this week, he has never really understood the reasons why Brendan Rodgers played him in defence during his first season at Anfield.

Downing, 30, has always been a forward and he has been in sparkling form in a number of advanced roles for Sam Allardyce’s upwardly mobile West Ham team this season.

Here he is, then, back in the England squad more than two years after his last appearance for the national team, against Norway. It feels good to be back.

‘I’m honest enough to think my England career had gone,’ he admitted. ‘I hadn’t been picked for two-and-a-half years and I thought Roy would go with the younger players. But you’ve just got to keep playing well and hopefully knock on the door. I am over the moon to be here.’

Downing’s flexibility appeals to Hodgson and is something that was picked up on by England scouts when he drifted in from the right and scored a beauty with his left foot against Crystal Palace in August.

Hodgson monitored his form and popped his head around the dressing-room door at Upton Park a few times to speak to Allardyce about some of his English players.

Downing, Mark Noble, Carl Jenkinson and Andy Carroll, who returned as a substitute against Aston Villa last weekend, are all eligible to play for England.

‘He has been coming the last couple of weeks and has been in the changing room to see Sam and I’ve spoken to him a couple of times,’ added Downing. ‘I knew he was there to watch certain players in our team because the manager told me.

‘My form for West Ham has helped and the way the team has been playing has helped me get noticed by Roy. He spoke to our manager about it and the certain positions that I’ve been playing.

‘When I signed for West Ham, Sam told me that if he got the chance, he’d want me to play in the middle at times. He said I’d start as a wide man to provide for Andy Carroll but Andy got injured.

‘This season with the lads like (Diafra) Sakho and (Enner) Valencia and the pace on the counter-attack, he wanted to make it more so we could break on teams.

‘I’ve played in the three in the middle and off the front man. I’m really enjoying it.’

The variety has whetted Downing’s appetite, drawing more out of him than at any other time of a career that had taken him to Middlesbrough, Sunderland, Aston Villa, and Liverpool. He enjoys the demands of the No 10 role, the deep-lying creator for Sakho and Valencia.

‘Wingers tend to move inside as they get older — Ryan Giggs did it,’ he added. ‘The manager has seen something in my game which made him think I could play there. He wants me to get on the ball more and counter-attack.’

Downing started out on the left all those years ago when he was part of the Middlesbrough squad that won the League Cup in 2004.

A decade later he has been rebuilt at West Ham, rekindling his enthusiasm for football and reminding Hodgson that he has game- changing qualities when he is in possession. Playing left back at Liverpool feels a long time ago.

‘It is not my natural position but I knew from then it was the time for me to move,’ he added. ‘I was getting signals other players were coming in.

‘I had discussions with the manager and wasn’t promised I would be in the team most weeks. I knew he was buying a lot of players, probably a lot in my position.

‘I was getting used at left back when I was a winger.

‘I think you know when the writing is on the wall for you under a manager or at a club. West Ham came at a good time for me to work for a manager who wanted me to play every week.

‘Liverpool is a great club and not many people walk out of there easily.’

He has recovered at West Ham and is now preparing for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia at Wembley on Saturday.

Only a few weeks ago, new England captain Wayne Rooney was sent off at Old Trafford for a reckless challenge on Downing in a Barclays Premier League fixture. ‘I haven’t mentioned it yet, but it was just a mistimed tackle,’ added Downing. ‘He got his punishment for it.’

And after more than two years out of the England team, Downing has more than served his time, too.
