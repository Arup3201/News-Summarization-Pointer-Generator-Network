A representative from Premier League leaders Chelsea  was at Anfield on Monday night to watch Swansea star Wilfried Bony in action.

The Blues had their chief European scout Mick Doherty in the stands to see the Ivorian live.

Bony, who has netted eight league goals for Garry Monk's side this season, failed to score as Liverpool ran out comfortable 4-1 winners.

The 26-year-old's display against Brendan Rodgers' side is unlikely to have put off potential suitors given his sterling goal-scoring record this year.

Bony has scored 20 Premier League goals for Swansea in 2014 - more than any other player in the division.

Liverpool are known admirers of the former Vitesse Arnhem forward, although they are not in a position to bid for him until the summer.

That may leave the door open for Chelsea, who could be looking for a long-term replacement for Didier Drogba.

The former Marseille striker has made a successful return to Stamford Bridge this season but at 36, and with just six months left on his current contract, Drogba does not represent Chelsea's future.

Wayne Rooney - 16

Edin Dzeko - 14 

Daniel Sturridge - 13

If Chelsea do make a move for Bony next month then they will do so knowing that the striker will be unavailable for most of January due to the Africa Cup of Nations.

He is set to represent the Ivory Coast at the tournament in Equatorial Guinea, with the Elephants' first game coming against Guinea on January 20.

Their final group fixture takes place on January 28, although Bony could be missing for at least another fortnight if his country reach the final in Bata on February 8.
