He's famous for championing the environment but Prince Charles is yet to add an electric car to the royal fleet - until now.

Visiting the Nissan UK car plant in Sunderland, the Prince of Wales, who is currently staying at his Scottish home, Birkhall, was offered the chance to sit in one of the vehicles.

And despite the presence of a large audience of workers armed with smartphones, the 66-year-old gamely strapped himself in.

New addition: Prince Charles was on cheerful form as he hopped into the driving seat of an electric car

Charles was undertaking his first engagement of the year following an extended holiday spent at Birkhall, which sits on the Balmoral Estate, with his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall.

The couple, who are known as the Duke and Duchess of Rothesay north of the border, spent Christmas with the Queen at Sandringham but travelled to Scotland almost immediately afterwards.

Charles' visit to Sunderland comes in the wake of a difficult few weeks for the royal family, which was shaken by allegations of sex abuse made about Prince Andrew and a furore over a BBC documentary about Charles.

The documentary, Reinventing the Royals, should have been aired on the 28th December but was shelved after Clarence House declined to release archive footage of Charles and his sons William and Harry. 

How does this work then? Charles had to concentrate as he was told how to turn the all-electric car on

Audience: Charles' exploits were watched by an audience of factory workers, all armed with smartphones

Environmentalist: Charles' visit touched on one of his favourite topics, safeguarding the environment

Despite his woes, Charles started the new year on genial form - perhaps helped along a subject, the environment, about which he is passionate.

As a result, the car that got the royal seal of approval was the Nissan LEAF, an electric car that went into production in March 2013 and has since become the world's best-selling electric vehicle.

In total, 7,000 have been sold in the UK with more than 158,000 snapped up by eco-friendly drivers worldwide.

'We were honoured to receive a visit from the Prince of Wales,' said Paul Willcox, chairman of Nissan Europe afterwards.

'With a keen, lifelong interest in sustainability, His Royal Highness was interested to see LEAF production as well as hear about Sunderland’s achievements as one of the UK’s most successful car plants.'

Back to work: Charles, who has spent the last few weeks at Birkhall, was undertaking his first visit of 2015

Packed schedule: The 66-year-old royal is set for a busy week with several engagements pencilled in

Interest: The visit to the Nissan factory in Sunderland also dovetails with Charles' interest in technology

Exciting year: The Prince of Wales will become a grandfather for the second time in April

The visit also allowed Charles to start 2015 with a glimpse of another project close to his heart: helping young people into careers.

After leaving the car behind on the production line, the royal made a detour to the Nissan Global Training Centre, where apprentices are taught the ropes.

Charles has long had an interest in manufacturing, using a speech at the Science Museum on December to expand on his hopes for the future of heavy industry.

'This country really does have the most enviable history of enterprise in the fields of engineering, science, technology and manufacturing,' he said, before warning that a shortage of engineers could bring all this grinding to a halt.

'While all of this is going on,' he continued, 'there are still high levels of youth unemployment, as I know only too well through the work of my Prince’s Trust. 

'Many of these young people could, with the right opportunity and training, fill some of the gaps.'

Some of those who could one day fill those gaps were on hand to meet Prince Charles was introduced to some of Nissan's  'industrial cadets'  - children who want to learn more about engineering, to put their lessons into practice.

The children, from Gillis Lane Primary School in Sunderland and St. Cuthbert's in Newcastle, were waiting for him at the Training Centre, with  Charles clearly enjoying his chat with them - and the chance to indulge in a race using toy cars designed with the help of Nissan.

Speaking about the scheme, Nissan's Kevin Fitzpatrick said: 'Nissan launched the Skills Foundation last year with the aim of using everything from electric vehicles to Formula One to encourage young people to take up careers in manufacturing and engineering.

'As one of the region’s largest employers it’s important that Nissan take a lead role. I was delighted for the opportunity to show The Prince of Wales just some of the activities that we offer the region’s schools.'

Helpful: Ms Armstrong, 63, was part of the group waiting at the National Citizen Service Sunderland branch

Fascinated: Charles speaks to 17-year-old Megan Dakers and her pupil, 75-year-old Doris Atkinson

The royal, who has a busy schedule of engagements planned for this week and next, will have ample opportunity to spend more time chatting with youngsters once his second grandchild arrives in April.

Although the sex of the baby is not yet known, the Duchess of Cambridge told a teenager that she could 'feel it kicking' during a busy morning in Kensington yesterday. 

Indeed, Charles was given a further opportunity to meet young people when his second visit of the day took him to a National Citizen Service event, where he was also introduced to boxer Amir Khan.

Khan, who is an ambassador for the NCS, and the prince were welcomed by 17-year-old Megan Dakers from Washington who was taking part in a scheme to teach the elderly how to use technology.

With her was her pupil, 75-year-old Doris Atkinson, who was given a tutorial on the finer points of iPad use by a smiling Miss Dakers, watched by Prince Charles.

Khan, meanwhile, offered a technology lesson of his own and showed 63-year-old Marta Armstrong how to use a tablet computer - much to her delight.
