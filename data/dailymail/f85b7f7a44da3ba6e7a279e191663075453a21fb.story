Obsessed: The Old Bailey heard how Stuart Hazell used his mobile phone to trawl the web for child porn before he killed 12-year-old Tia Sharp

Google is under pressure to act over the ease with which Stuart Hazell was able to use the internet to fuel his child-sex fantasies.

Hazell was obsessed by paedophile websites and used his mobile phone to trawl the web for child porn before he killed 12-year-old Tia Sharp.

Police found searches including the terms ‘naked little girlies’, ‘illegal under-age incest pics’ and ‘schoolgirl abuse’ in his Google browser.

There were also Google searches for ‘violent forced rape’, ‘little girls in glasses’, ‘daddy daughter pictures’ and ‘under-age incest galleries’, and he visited a child abuse website on August 6 last year – as Tia’s body lay hidden in the loft of the home he shared with her grandmother.

Experts believe Hazell’s habitual use of violent and paedophile pornography on the internet saw him progress from petty criminal to child killer.

Last night child safety charities, including the NSPCC, demanded Google introduce immediate controls to stop monsters such as Hazell from getting access to child pornography.

John Carr, of the Children’s Charities’ Coalition on Internet Safety, said: ‘If these images were not available on the internet then men like Stuart Hazell might not go on to kill.

‘We cannot blame the internet for the likes of Stuart Hazell but it has opened pathways that lead them on to violent pornography and paedophile material.’

Campaigners say Google can 'do more' to block access to child pornography

Mr Carr wants web companies such as Google to trigger online warnings when attempts are made to access explicit sites. He also wants Google to make their ‘safe search’ facility the default on their web browser.

He added: ‘That is something Google could do overnight.’

Jon Brown, of the NSPCC, said: ‘Google need to do more in terms of blocking searches for child abuse imagery but they also need to be alerting the authorities if someone is  blatantly doing these searches.’

Jim Gamble, the former head of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, said the internet could create a ‘spiral of abuse’ where offenders awakened their sexual interest in children and met like-minded people who normalised their behaviour.

He added: ‘Ultimately what they find online is not enough to satisfy them and they can move to attacking a real child in the real world.’

Hazell had some 30 previous convictions dating back to the early 1990s for offences ranging from dishonesty, drug dealing and violence to a conviction for possessing a machete.

He had no history of sex offences and there was no suggestion he was a threat to children.

However the Old Bailey heard how he had become obsessed by pornography and had downloaded ‘extensive’ illegal images onto memory cards he had hidden at his home.

Critics believe stopping monsters like Hazell accessing child porn could save victims like Tia Sharp in the future

He kept photographs and video clips showing Tia sleeping - and on one occasion filmed her as she rubbed cream on her legs in her underwear.

Police also discovered a grotesque image of a girl believed to be Tia which is thought to have been taken after she died.

The highly disturbing ‘keepsake’ image showed a naked girl, whose face cannot be seen, posed on all fours on a bloodied bed.

Mr Brown added: ‘The use of imagery in sex offending is not new. The Moors Murderers Ian Brady and Myra Hindley photographed and filmed their victims.

‘But the internet means this kind of behaviour has taken on a new dimension. There are clearly some violent and particularly psychopathic who use the internet.

‘We are very concerned that the ease with which they can get child abuse images to fuel their fantasies.’

Police found Hazell had used Google on his mobile phone to access websites that glorified incest and child abuse.

But his behaviour had escalated from accessing images of abuse online to actively seeking to spy on, photograph and film Tia.

He is believed to have removed the bathroom door at Tia’s grandmother’s home so he could spy on the schoolgirl.

And Hazell is also thought to have modified the light socket in her room to create a spyhole.

A report by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection (CEOP) Centre has identified a link between viewing child porn online and ‘contact’ sexual offences against children.

Jim Gamble, the former head of Ceop, said the internet could create a ‘spiral of abuse’ where offenders awakened their sexual interest in children and met like-minded people who normalised their behaviour.

He added: ‘Ultimately what they find online is not enough to satisfy them and they can move to attacking a real child in the real world.’

Hazell’s escalation in offending is similar to Vincent Tabak who murdered Joanna Yeates in Bristol in 2010 after becoming fixated with extreme pornography sites showing women being strangled.

Miranda Suit from the Safetynet campaign which is calling for a family friendly internet believes Google should do more to block illegal images.

She added: ‘The ease of access provided by the Internet means more people than ever before are going down that route.’

A Google spokesman said: ‘We take this issue extremely seriously. When we discover child abuse imagery or are made aware of it, we respond quickly to remove and report it to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.’
