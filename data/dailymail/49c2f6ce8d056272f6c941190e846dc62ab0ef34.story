British men are paying hundreds of pounds for their friends to be arrested and kidnapped on stag dos in Eastern Europe.

The 'Kidnap The Stag' schemes, run by some of the UK's top events firms, promise to 'terrify' the groom-to-be in the latest party-planning craze.

One firm arranges for the man to be stopped in the street by two plain-clothed officers before being forced into a car, charged, and threatened with jail.

Prison: British firm Redsevenleisure offers for the groom to be captured by Russian soldiers and taken to a prison where he is intimidated while crying and gunshots

Another firm's party package offers 'an unexpected trip to prison courtesy of Russian soldiers', complete with intimidation, gun shots and crying.

Tourists pay upwards of £150 for the events, available across Estonia, Latvia and Budapest.

London-based events company Chillisauce - which offers the £170 service in Estonia's Tallinn, Riga in Latvia, and Budapest - touts it as 'a brilliant stitch-up'.

And according to chief executive James Baddiley, they employ real police officers, The Sun reported.

Kidnap: London-based Chillisauce offers to kidnap the groom in Estonia, Latvia or Budapest

The firm touts the event as a 'brilliant stitch-up that would make Jeremy Beadle proud'

He told the paper: 'The realism is part of the excitement. You don't want to pay for something then see someone turn up in a plastic police hat.'

Advertising the event, the website says: 'What better way to let your stag enjoy his last dignified moments of freedom than watching him brown his pants as he's arrested by two plain-clothes police officers on the pub crawl for being drunk and disorderly?

'Not for real of course.'

The man is interrogated by 'two heavy-handed Estonian policemen', has a hood put over his head and is led down a street - where he is greeted by his friends at a strip club.

The website adds: 'He'll then have to explain to the group why he's weeping like a little girl.'

Craze: It is a growing craze in the party-planning market despite one case last year where a man developed shingles as his friends pulled a 'Guntanamo'-themed prank on him to celebrate his nuptials

The growing craze follows the traumatic case of groom Ollie McAninch who was last July left so disturbed after being kidnapped by 16 masked men in a terrifying stag-do prank he almost missed his wedding.

Mr McAninch, 33, developed shingles after the ordeal in and was told to avoid his fiance for a month, leaving his big day in doubt.

He was driving along a country lane with fiancee Clair Hart when the gang jumped out of the bushes and blocked his path.

Brandishing baseball bats and setting off stun grenades, they told him to 'get out of the f****** car, get on the floor!' and bundled him into the back of a van.

He was bound, gagged and dressed in a Guantanamo Bay-style jumpsuit.
