A New Jersey woman was sentenced to 18 months parole Thursday for abandoning her pet pit bull in 2011.

The pit bull named Patrick was found around St. Patrick's day in 2011 in her apartment building's dumpster. He weighed an emaciated 19 pounds and was covered in sores.

While his former owner Kisha Curtis, 29, denies ever having thrown the dog in the garbage, she has admitted to leaving Patrick outside her hallway while she left for a week. Miraculously, Patrick survived.

Parole: Newark, New Jersey mother Kisha Curtis was sentenced to 18 months parole today after she was convicted of animal abuse

Before and after: Curtis' dog was found at the bottom of her apartment building's trash chute wrapped in plastic, and severely underweight. Patrick's new owner nursed the pit bull back to health

Fair sentence: Outside the courtroom, Curtis told News 12 New Jersey that she found the ruling fair. Animal rights activists did not agree

Curtis, who cares for three of her children, plead guilty to fourth-degree animal cruelty late last month.

Kisha's sentencing today came as quite a shock to Patrick's supporters who attended.

The group called 'The Patrick Movement' was pushing for the maximum sentence: 18 months in prison.

In his sentencing, Essex County Judge Joseph Cassini III said that Curtis has been 'tried in the court of public opinion' and 'portrayed as a monster' in the weeks after her arrest.

He explained that while he himself was a dog owner and lover, Curtis' case needs to be put in perspective.

He mentioned a case he was dealing with later in the day involving a man who killed a police officer. 'On a scale of 10, with 10 being the most serious, Ms. Curtis' case, from where I sit, is around a three or a four,' he said. 'In this case, fortunately, no one was killed; Patrick survived and is thriving. We have to put things in perspective.'

Permanent home: An upside of today's ruling is that Patrick gets to stay with his new owners, the veterinarian and his wife who initially nursed the dog back to health

That sentence was a let down for the many who championed a stricter punishment for Curtis.

'I just wanted her to serve some time,' said Allison Ognibene. 'She left this dog to die. After 2 1/2 years of dragging this out, I don't think justice was served.'

Curtis' attorney was happy with the decision, highlighting the fact that Curtis' court ordered mental health and substance abuse counseling seems to be working. 

'She has done well the last two years; she has been a model citizen,' Rivera said. '(The judge) followed the law and followed it justly.'

Because of the level of the offense, and the fact that she didn't have a prior record, Rivera says that her client was entitled to the probationary term.

While Curtis may not be spending time locked up like her opponents would like to see, er actions have caused a change in the way crimes like this will be dealt with in the future.

Last month, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie signed into law 'Patrick's Law' which increases the fines and maximum prison sentences for animal cruelty offenses.

And a positive of today's ruling is that Patrick gets to stay with his new owners, the couple who originally nursed him back to health.

Living corpse: Patrick was found a day before St. Patrick's Day in 2011 at the bottom of Curtis' apartment building trash chute, wrapped in plastic and very malnourished

Abused: Patrick was in bad shape when he was brought into Garden State Veterinary Specialists

Throughout the trial, Curtis continued to deny ever abusing Patrick .

She claimed that she left the puppy in a hallway before it was found by someone else in the bottom of a trash shoot bone thin, curled in a ball and near death.

The dog has since miraculously made a full recovery while now weighing a remarkable 50lbs after he was discovered moments before the trash compactor would have killed him.

After the court decision today, Patrick will live permanently with his new owners: the Scavelli family. Dr and Mrs Scavelli run the Tinton Falls veterinary facility where the dog was first treated and are responsible for saving his life

Miracle recovery: Though they originally considered euthanasia, Patricial Smillie-Scavelli and her husband decided to give Patrick a chance at life

While the obviously horrific trauma the dog ensured as seen from some of the first pictures revealed inevitably left emotional and physical scarring, those who know Patrick talk only of how loving and trusting he is.

'He is a tremendous fighter,' said Dr
 Thomas Scavelli, the director and founder of the Garden State 
Veterinary Specialists, the pet hospital in Tinton Falls where Patrick 
has been treated.

His 
wife, Patricia Smillie-Scavelli, told Irish Central: 'He really gives 
love. He climbs into your lap, he would prefer to sit in your lap than 
lay on the floor. He also sleeps in our bed at night, along with the 
cat.'

A better life: Now back to a normal weight and living with a loving family, Patrick is thriving

Though understandably Patrick remains nervous around strangers, reported NBC, a treat or two quickly remedies his fear.

'There are very few animals, or any life form, that could have gone through and survived what he has, and really never looked back,' said Dr Scavelli of his courageous recovery.

And few who have simultaneously become so much of a celebrity. 

Hospital staffers have chronicled his progress on their website 
and a Facebook page has garnered fans from around the world.

He's received hundreds of emails, donations, gifts and letters from those inspired by his tale of survival.

The hospital ordered 500 thank-you cards with Patrick's picture to mail 
to those who have sent collars, dog shirts, toys, scrapbook pages or dog 
blankets embroidered with Patrick's name, and they are fast running out.

When
 Patrick was brought to the hospital after being rescued by officials at
 the Associated Humane Societies, he was so starved, emaciated and 
dehydrated he was curled into a ball, unable to walk or stand.

His ribcage protruded, he 
weighed about 20 pounds - roughly 30 pounds less than average - and was 
covered in sores with parts of skin hanging off him, according to Mrs 
Smillie-Scavelli.

'Everyone thought that, you bring in 
an animal like that, that looks like it's really just a corpse, you put 
it to sleep,' Mrs Smillie-Scavelli said.

'But
 of course, he looked up at you with those eyes, and you say: How can 
you give up on this dog? How can you, when he's not giving up on life? 
So, we gave him that second chance, and he has just run with it, and 
thrived.'

- Vets on their decision to not euthanize Patrick

After weeks of emergency measures that
 included a transfusion of three pints of dog blood, a special diet, 
medicine and physical therapy, Patrick began to gain weight and eat 
solid food.

He also started to enjoy taking outdoor walks in the sun and playing with the many toys that well-wishers had sent him.

'This
 is not a month of starvation,' Dr Scavelli said soon after his rescue. 
'This is a lifetime probably, or at least months and months of neglect, 
and to see the way he cares for people and trusts people, that's really 
been the most interesting and rewarding thing to see about the canine 
spirit.'

Authorities said Curtis tied the dog to a railing in her Newark apartment building and left the state for more than a week. A janitor later found the emaciated dog in a trash bin.

Her mother told reporters at her daughter's court hearing that the dog had been given to Kisha but she could not take care of it, so she'd tied it up outside hoping somebody else would take it.

The Essex County courthouse has also received more than 600 letters and 
faxes from around the world expressing concern for the dog and urging 
swift and harsh punishment for Curtis.

'In the 17 years we've been here we've never seen this type of response 
to an animal,' Mrs Smillie-Scavelli said.

'There's something about 
Patrick that has really sparked interest, honestly, from throughout the 
entire world.'
