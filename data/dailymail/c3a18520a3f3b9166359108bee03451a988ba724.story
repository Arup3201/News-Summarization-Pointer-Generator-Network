Skills: Minister Matthew Hancock has advised over 50s seeking a career change to undertake apprenticeship schemes

Middle-aged men and women seeking a career change should undertake apprenticeship schemes so they can re-train as lawyers, bankers and accountants, according to a Government minister.

Skills minister Matthew Hancock has advised those over 50 to take part in the professional schemes usually carried out by graduates fresh out of university.

With the retirement age rising, it is estimated that although many over 50s will remain in good health, they are likely to miss out on job opportunities because of their age.

Currently more than 425,000 men and women over 50 are unemployed, with the number set to rise.

However,
 Tory MP Mr Hancock has stated that older workers, with their 
highly-prized skill sets, can play a vital part in economic recovery by 
re-training.

He said that demand for adult 
apprenticeships was increasing as they help workers, including those 
over 50, first to gain employment, and then keep skilled jobs.

'Apprenticeships
 increasingly help people of all ages get the skills they need to get 
the new jobs becoming available, he told the Telegraph.

'Our
 priority is to build on the best of the Apprenticeships programme 
expanding Apprenticeships where they deliver the greatest benefits for 
employers, apprentices and the wider economy.'

Government data has revealed that in the last 12 months more than 34,000 over 50s started an apprenticeship, and that one in three of those were rewarded with a job in law, business or administration.

Around 5,690 workers gained employment in commercial enterprise or retail, while 11,790 people over 50 started new careers in health, care and public services.

Study: Mr Hancock encouraged older people to take part in the professional scheme allowing them to become lawyers, bankers and accountants

Government ministers are seeking to increase the number of apprenticeships offered by companies that can match studying for a degree, either at undergraduate or postgraduate level.

Last month the London Professional Apprenticeship Programme, costing £2.3million, was launched to help people find jobs in professional service roles such as accountancy, management consultancy and tax advice. 

A funding scheme which meant apprentices aged over 24 had to take out loans to fund their training was also axed by ministers, with the costs now met by employers and the government.

'It can be a route into management for people who may not have done a degree who have a wealth of experience and skill. It gives them a qualification that's valued by employers,' said Aiden Relf, a spokesman for the Association of Employment and Learning Providers.
