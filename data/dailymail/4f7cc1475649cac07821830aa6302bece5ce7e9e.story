Heroic: Michael Graver said he would do the same again if he had to

When a gang of armed smash-and-grab robbers on mopeds nearly knocked over his wife on their way to raid a jeweller's, pensioner Michael Graver saw red.

In scenes described by police as 'like a cartoon', the 71-year-old grandfather tried to shove one moped and its occupants over, chased one of the thugs into the shop and grabbed a bag off him as he tried to escape.

The violent criminal, who was wielding a sledgehammer, was so shocked that he stopped and did a double-take at his empty hands before leaping back on his getaway vehicle.

The gang's bad day at the office wasn't over, however.

Not only had they been left without the £22,000 of watches they had snatched thanks to Mr Graver's courageous intervention but another passer-by compounded their humiliation by giving chase and trying to wallop them with a bag he was carrying.

Mr Graver has now spoken about his extraordinary role in the drama in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, after a judge jailed the gang for a total of 36 years and awarded the retired businessman £500 for his 'commendable fortitude and bravery'.

'The police said the CCTV footage of it was like a cartoon,' said the father-of-three, who lives in the town with wife Penny, 64.

'One moment he's got the bag and the next he hasn't and he's doing a double take as he gets on the scooter.

'[Afterwards] we just stood there in the doorway waiting for a uniformed officer to give this bag to.' Mr Graver acted after the gang roared up outside Thurlow Champness jewellers on February 28 last year.

'I was really quite annoyed because these guys came on scooters and they nearly hit my wife,' he said.

'She was walking with a stick at the time because she had fallen on the ice a few weeks before.

'They did not slow and nearly hit her. I was really mad. We were in the middle of it all and we couldn't not be involved.

'One of the scooters pulled up alongside me and I tried to push the pillion passenger and the scooter over.

'The other pillion driver had got off and gone into the jeweller's. I could see that part of the display had been caved in and that a raid was going on. I then ran inside - my wife, Penny, was telling me not to.' Inside the jeweller's, he found one of the gang threatening staff with a sledgehammer in one hand and holding the bag stuffed with watches in the other.

'He rushed towards me. He just wanted to get out. He was working to a timetable as Penny heard them say outside "We're out of time".

The man was wearing a nylon jacket and Mr Graver ended up grabbing the bag he was holding as he couldn't get a firm grip on his arm.

The robber tried snatching it back but let go and ran over to one of the mopeds.

Jed Macdonald, one of the raiders, is seen here.

As they rode off, another have-a-go hero, shop assistant Mark Baker, swatted at them with his bag. He received minor injuries after he was hit on the hand with the sledgehammer.

Four months later they staged another raid at Goldsmiths jewellers in Ipswich.

On that occasion, they made off with Rolex and Omega watches worth £78,000 and caused £20,000 to the premises.

They were caught after witnesses recorded what happened on their mobile phones and residents in a nearby road took down the registration of what turned out to be a getaway car after noticing suspicious activity.

Dean Armstrong, 21, Charlie Kavanagh, 21, Jed McDonald, 22, and George Paget, 20, all admitted conspiracy to rob at a hearing in March.

Dwayne Marsh, 34, denied the charge but was found guilty following a trial.

Kavanagh, McDonald and Marsh, all from London, each received six year jail terms at Ipswich Crown Court on Monday.

Armstrong and Paget, also from London, were both sentenced to nine years.

Judge David Goodin also awarded £500 each to Mr Baker and off-duty PC Joseph Mullett, who lunged at one of the mopeds in Ipswich.

Detective Inspector David Giles said afterwards: 'What they were unable to plan for was the community of Suffolk who assisted in hindering and detecting this crime.'
