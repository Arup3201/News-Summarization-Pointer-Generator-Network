Charles Rowan, a cage fighter from Michigan, faked his own death to avoid an $80,000 debt from his drug dealer. He's not only still alive, he was sentenced to 17 1/2 to 40 years in prison yesterday after he pleaded guilty to robbing a Michigan gun store.

Rowan, 26, pleaded guilty to robbing the store in August but most of his family and friends thought he had died tragically in a car accident.

The New York Times wrote an article following the incident and said fighting promoters, Rowan's family, and fans were so troubled by his death that they set up fights in Rowan's memory. 1,000 tickets were sold. There was a facebook group dedicated to raising money for Rowan's family.

Charles Rowan, 26, 'died' shortly before he was arrested for robbing a Michigan gun store with a hammer

At a memorial service for the fighter, Rowan himself was hiding upstairs in a child's room waiting for the service to end. The Times reports that Rowan was so heartbroken by listening to his family's grief, he thought about ending the service and marching downstairs.

Rowan's girlfriend Rosa Martinez sparked rumors of Rowan's death by making a convincing phone call to fight promoter Diponio, saying Rowan was badly injured and needed to be airlifted to a hospital. His own mother thought he was dead.

Weeks later, a Gladwin gun store called, 'Guns and Stuff' was robbed and Rowan's face was in the mugshot--to many's surprise. He fled to his mother's house who turned him in to the police. He was also helped by Martinez, and a friend named Micheal Bowman who will be sentenced in January. 

Rosa Martinez called Rowan's mother and fighting promoter to say he'd died and they believed her story

Why rob the store if he was dead and ready to start his life anew? The fighter, who originally faked his death to escape cocaine debt from his dealer Micheal Gomez, met with the dealer after his 'death' and Gomez told Rowan he would hurt Martinez and her children.

That's when out of fear and desperation, Rowan went to the gun store armed with a hammer, and hit the 75-year-old store owner, Richard Robinette, on the head. Gawker reports that Martinez stayed behind and called 911.

When Rowan tried calling Martinez, a policeman named James Cuddie answered the phone and asked who he was. Rowan lied and said he was his cousin. The police officer was skeptical and started investigating Rowan's death.

Robinette's family said he is said to have recovered miraculously.

'There was a lot of blood,'Rowan said. 'Enough to scare me. I’m a man used to seeing a lot of blood, but that was a lot of blood.' 

Micheal Bowman assisted Rowan in the robbery and will be sentenced for the crime in January

Unbeknownst to his family, Rowan was a cocaine user and did some work for drug dealers. He allegedly worked for Gomez, who had links to The Latin Kings and The Mexican Mafia Gang, and lost a shipment of cocaine worth $80,000.

Rowan told Gomez that thieves jumped him, cracked his ribs, and took his drugs. Gomez wasn't happy with Rowan's story so he arranged for men to beat Rowan up outside of a local Shopko. He was badly beaten, at least that's what Rowan told his friends.

A downtrodden Rowan was inspired to start anew after watching a show on the Discovery Channel at his girlfriend Martinez's house about a man who faked his death to start a new life.

Rowan had a rich criminal history in addition to owing drug money. Ever since Rowan was a kid he stole 'guns, dumb things, work tools, and money,' Rowan's stepfather Scott Gardner told The New York Times. 

Friend's and fans payed homage to Rowan after he died with photos like these posted on a friend's facebook page

Rowan had previously been arrested for failure to pay child support and for selling marijuana. He also was arrested on charges of sexual misconduct with a teenager.

Rowan was a father of three--all to different women. He also was no stranger to fighting and was beaten by his father for years.

The Times reports that Rowan's father would stomp on his head and that when his father was dying of cancer, his father wished the illness on Rowan instead of himself.

Rowan was a sort of underdog in the fighting world. He called himself The Freight Train. Fans called him a 'tomato can' a term that alludes to the fact that it was easy to knock Rowan down and that 'red stuff' came out.

Another thing--Rowan fought for free. He enjoyed the fight more than the monetary gain. He loved getting hyped in on coke and then going into the cage for a beating that usually ended up in his getting knocked out.

'It’s amazing that guys will get beat up for free,' Christos Piliafas, a top fighter in Michigan, said. 'They just love to fight.'

He also said, 'He was a horrible fighter. He just showed up and would fight. He was a great first fight for someone.

Despite loving to fight, Rowan had no trouble owning up to his mistakes and expressing remorse.

'All three of us deserved to be punished for what we did,' Rowan said on Monday in a phone interview from jail with The New York Times.

'Unfortunately, my life has been on a downward spiral for a few years,' he said.

'And finally, I just hit the bottom. I hope one day that I can make something of my life and show Mr. Robinette or his family that I learned my lesson,' he concluded.
