Here's animated TV favourite Morph indulging in a little role-clay - by feeding a peanut to an eager squirrel.

The amusing picture was taken by Morph co-creator Peter Lord, who often takes the terracotta-coloured character on his travels and snaps him in unusual places.

This time, he carefully positioned a peanut in Morph's hand and patiently waited in Brandon Hill park, Bristol.

Eventually, a brave squirrel approached and quickly snatched away the tasty treat and in one picture, an eagle-eyed pigeon can be seen watching from close behind.

A spokeswoman for Lord's animation firm, Aardman, said: 'Peter quite often takes Morph out on about on his travels and snaps pictures, and this was just another of those instances.'

Morph originally appeared in 1977 as artist-turned-presenter Tony Hart's sidekick on Take Hart, and became a firm favourite on children's television over the next 20 years.

The last time Morph appeared on television screens was in 1997 but now, nearly two decades on, Aardman has resurrected the character thanks to an online campaign. 

Last year, Lord launched a fundraising project to produce new episodes featuring Morph on crowd-funding site Kickstarter. 

The initial target of £75,000 to fund 12 one-minute episodes was reached in just nine days.

In January this year, the studio began production on 15 brand new episodes of Morph, including one where the character takes on the Ice Bucket Challenge.

Morph was first created in 1977 by Peter Lord and David Sproxton, and was named because he is always made out of a single lump of clay and can change shape

His first ever TV appearance was broadcast on BBC1 on February 15, 1977.  

He appeared in one minute 'shorts' interspersed throughout children's TV shows presented by Tony Hart.

The character was known for living in a box, and was later joined by a white-coloured friend called Chas, allowing the two to interact.

They often changed shape completely, and could be rolled, squished or bent into various shapes.

While the original show was axed in 1997, there were several small Morph scenes created over following years before Mr Lord's recent Kickstarter campaign funded a whole new series.
