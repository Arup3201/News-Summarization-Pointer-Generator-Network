Louis van Gaal’s start to his career at Manchester United may not have been as smooth as he had wished – but one Dutchman has thrived since arriving in England this summer.

Ronaldo Koeman’s Southampton are flying high in the Premier League and are third in the table and go into Saturday’s clash with Stoke on the back of the 8-0 thrashing of Sunderland.

The two Dutchmen have history having worked together at both Barcelona and Ajax and have been known to have had a frosty relationship.

But according to Koeman, that has thawed there is no longer an issue between them.

The pair will meet for first time in December at St Mary’s and Koeman says it will be a special occasion.

Speaking to The Mirror, he said: ‘We have worked together, first when I was his assistant at Barcelona and he was the head coach.

‘Then, during my period with Ajax as the coach, he came in after two seasons as technical director and we had some fights about the coaching structure, the way of doing things and that was a problem at the time.

Koeman worked as Van Gaal's assistant at Barcelona back in the late 1990s 

‘But it’s not like that anymore – it’s in the past. I have my job to do at Southampton, he has his job to do at Manchester United and, of course, it will be a little bit special when we play against them.

‘It will be two Dutch coaches facing each other in the Premier League and I hope the best for him and for United. They are a club who have to be at the top and he has achieved great things as a manager in the past.’

Before Koeman and Van Gaal meet, Southampton face back-to-back games with Stoke in the Premier League and Capital One Cup.

And if Southampton are to continue their good form, a lot could rely on the form of £10.9million signing Dusan Tadic.

The Serbian playmaker set up four of the Saints eight goals against Sunderland last week and has been one of the players of the season so far.

But the Southampton boss admits he was surprised to land Tadic.

Koeman added: 'I was always confident about Dusan because he has exceptional qualities. His assists, his goals, his feel for the game belongs on the big stages. But I didn’t expect to sign him for Southampton, I was surprised when he came here. I thought we would be fighting against bigger clubs.'
