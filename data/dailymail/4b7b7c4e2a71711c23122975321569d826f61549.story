We all know it’s time to start panicking about Christmas when the festive sandwiches hit the shops.

Every High Street chain brings out their own version, but not all are created equal.

In general, the fillings tend to follow two main themes — there’s the meaty ‘full works’ roast dinner sandwich, which is usually turkey with bacon, stuffing and cranberry sauce, or there’s the vegetarian cheesy number, more often than not embellished with some kind of spiced, fruit chutney.

But are any of them any good? And can anyone do anything different this year?

I pitted some of the main players against each other to see who’s king of the festive sandwiches in 2014.

Starbucks Turkey & Bacon Panini, £3.99

Turkey breast, pork, sage and onion stuffing, festively fruity cranberry sauce, smoked bacon, rich gravy, spinach and crispy onions on rustic ciabatta.

Fat: 17g

Sugar: 10g

Calories: 477

This has a vaguely Christmassy taste, but is rather bland; odd considering there are so many fillings.

The main detectable flavour is the stuffing, which is the common curse of Christmas sandwiches — nothing else really stands up to it.

I can find no evidence of any ‘rich gravy’ or ‘crispy onions’. Overall, it has a sort of strange manufactured smell to it, a bit like you’ve used a new appliance but forgotten to take the plastic cover off first. 4/10

Costa Cheeseboard with Chutney Panini, £3.95

Creamy French Brie, mature Cheddar, Red Leicester, tangy cranberry sauce and baby leaf spinach on seeded stone-baked sourdough ciabatta.

Fat: 20g

Sugar: 7.5g

Calories: 515

I’m not sure this bread quite knows what it is (anyone heard of a seeded ciabatta before?), but I know what it isn’t — the right choice for this sandwich. It crisps up on top, yet is unpleasantly soggy around the edges.

I also have to subject the filling to serious scrutiny before I detect any Cheddar or Red Leicester inside. It’s basically just a Brie and cranberry toastie with spinach that frankly, tastes a bit like it’s ‘on the turn’. Not impressed. 2/10

EAT Festive Full Works Bloomer, £3.65

Turkey, cranberry sauce, pork, sage and onion stuffing, smoked ham, reduced fat mayonnaise and salad leaves on multi-seed bloomer.

Fat: 19.5g

Sugar: 15.7g

Calories: 583

This is a very generously-filled sandwich with distinct layers that look really rather pretty for a pre-packed effort. I particularly like the fact that EAT has done away with the usual flabby cold bacon, and replaced it with ham; a wise decision.

Sadly it does succumb somewhat to the Christmas Sandwich Curse in that it tastes mainly of stuffing and cranberry sauce — but if you’re into both of those then this is ahead of many in its field. A point for improvement: as ever with EAT sandwiches, the bread could be fresher. 6/10

Morrisons Turkey, Bacon and Stuffing, £2.29

Turkey, smoked bacon, pork stuffing and cranberry chutney on malted bread.

Fat: 11.7g

Sugar: 6.7g

Calories: 426

A basic approach, this; just turkey meat, stuffing and chutney. Not a leaf or extra in sight.

The turkey here is formed into small chunks rather than sliced, which makes for a crumbly filling that is rather unpleasant to eat.

As for the bacon, it’s just offensive: limp, and greasy. There’s an odd chemical sagey back note to the stuffing.

Overall, I get the sense that a pile of Christmas leftovers has been mixed together to make this filling. A truly depressing sandwich. 1/10

Pret’s Christmas Lunch, £3.60

Free-range turkey, crumbly pork stuffing, cranberry and port sauce, crispy onions, spinach and mayo on malted bread.

Fat: 20.3g

Sugar: 11.1g

Calories: 540

I like how Pret has tried to do something different by adding the crispy onions, which do bring a pleasing textural contrast, but they have such an overwhelming flavour it’s all I can taste while I’m eating — and also for about three hours afterwards.

They even trump the stuffing — quite an achievement.

It’s all a bit sweet, too. To be honest I feel for Pret with this one, as overall the ingredients are fresh and you can sense it’s made the effort. For once, however, this falls a step behind its big High Street rival, EAT. 5/10

Sainsbury’s Christmas Triple, £3.50

One prawn mayo sandwich, one turkey feast sandwich (turkey, malted bread, chestnut and thyme stuffing, mayo, cranberry and apple chutney) and one mature cheddar and caramelised red onion and mayo sandwich.

Fat: 28g

Sugar: 14g

Calories: 643

I think Sainsbury’s is running with a three-course Christmas dinner idea here; prawn ‘cocktail’ to start, traditional Christmas dinner as a main course, and cheese to finish. Shame none of them are any good.

The prawn mayo is really fishy and stale tasting. There’s quite a generous fill on the turkey feast, but like the Morrison’s version, it has unappetising small chunks of turkey meat inside.

The stuffing reigns supreme once again, and it all just tastes a bit old. The cheese is partnered with some very sweet red onions. Meh! 2/10

M&S Turkey and pigs in blankets on sage and onion bread, £3.50

British pork sausages and bacon, British roast butter basted turkey breast, cranberry chutney, spiced mayonnaise and spinach on sage and onion bread.

Fat: 23.8g

Sugar: 14.1g

Calories: 552

I really like the idea of the sage and onion bread, which is a lovely way of incorporating that stuffing flavour, without over powering everything else.

Also, pigs in blankets have got to be one of the best bits of Christmas dinner.

The bacon here is better than in any other Christmas sandwich I’ve tried and the cranberry sauce isn’t sickly sweet. It’s generous, satisfying and meaty — the best of its kind by miles. 7/10
