Oscar Pistorius was told he will face trial for the murder of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in March as he appeared in court today - the same day that would have been her 30th birthday.

Wiping tears from his eyes, a visibly emotional Pistorius stood silently in the dock as he was formally indicted for premeditated murder at Pretoria Magistrates' Court.

The 26-year-old Paralympian, from South Africa, is accused of shooting Ms Steenkamp to death at their home on Valentine's night, but claims he opened fire on the 29-year-old after mistaking her for an intruder.

And after a hush finally descended on
 the packed courtroom, the judge set his trial to run from March 3 to 
March 20 next year at North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria.

Birthday: The 26-year-old Paralympian wiped tears from his eyes and blew his nose as he was served the indictment on the day Ms Steenkamp (right) would have turned 30

Family prayer: Before the hearing began he stood holding hands with sister Aimee and brother Carl as the three siblings prayed silently amid the commotion of the courtroom

The prosecution will present 107 witnesses, some of whom allegedly heard a woman scream, followed by 'moments of silence, then heard gunshots and then more screaming', the indictment says.

The state's witnesses will include Ms Steenkamp's close friends Desiree, Gina and Kim Myers, as well as Pistorius' sister Aimee and his uncle Arnold.

Less than an hour after the hearing ended, Pistorius' brother Carl tweeted a photograph of Oscar and Ms Steenkamp posing together alongside the words: 'Remembered like yesterday. My life was impacted by u @reevasteenkamp & the lady u were! Always close to our hearts.'

Friends of Ms Steenkamp were also in court.

When asked by Magistrate Desmond Nair if he was well, he replied quietly: 'Under the circumstances, your honour.'

But as
 proceedings were postponed, the BBC's Andrew Harding claimed to have shaken his hand and 
asked how he was, to which Pistorius apparently shook his head and 
mouthed: 'Not good.'

The six-time Paralympic sprint 
champion was initially charged with premeditated murder for bail 
purposes while police investigated the circumstances of the shooting before a finalised indictment was served on 
the double amputee today.

'In our hearts': Less than an hour after the hearing ended, Pistorius' brother Carl tweeted a photograph of Oscar and Ms Steenkamp posing together alongside the words: 'Remembered like yesterday. My life was impacted by u @reevasteenkamp & the lady u were! Always close to our hearts'

'Not good'! As proceedings were postponed, BBC journalist Andrew Harding, who was sitting behind Pistorius in court, claimed to have shaken his hand and asked how he was, to which Pistorius apparently shook his head and mouthed: 'Not good'

The
 prosecution will retain a main charge of premeditated murder. If 
convicted, Pistorius faces a life sentence with a minimum of 25 years in
 prison.

The indictment accuses Pistorius of murder, and unlawful possession of ammunition, contrary to Section 90 of the Firearms Control Act.

In a summary, prosecutors allege Pistorius shot Ms Steenkamp, whose cause of death was given as multiple gunshot wounds, four times through the locked bathroom door but said, even if he thought she was an intruder, an 'error in persona' did not affect the fact he intended to kill someone.

The summary alleges that Ms Steenkamp locked herself in the toilet cubicle next to the main bedroom at Pistorius' house in the early hours of February 14.

It claims the athlete armed himself with his 9mm pistol and fired four shots through the locked door. The cause of his girlfriend's death, which happened just after 3am, is given as 'multiple gunshot wounds'.

Some state witnesses heard a woman scream, followed by 'moments of silence, then heard gunshots and then more screaming', the summary said.

It added: 'The accused said to witnesses on the scene, that he thought she was an intruder.

'Even then, the accused shot with the direct intention to kill a person. An error in persona will not affect the intention to kill a human being.'

Some 107 witnesses are listed by the state, including Ms Steenkamp's close friends Desiree, Gina and Kim Myers, as well as Pistorius' sister Aimee and his uncle Arnold.

Additional charged 
are also 'possible', prosecutors told The Associated Press, but declined
 to comment about the charges before today's hearing.  

It
 has been reported that the Paralympian could face extra charges of 
allegedly discharging a firearm recklessly in two other incidents.

Papers
 presented at the court today are expected to include a witness list and
 detail some of the evidence police have gathered in the six months 
since the death of Ms Steenkamp.

Pistorius
 is currently on bail after a judge changed his conditions in March, 
allowing him to travel abroad providing he hand over his travel plans.

The 'Blade Runner', who was recently 
spotted kayaking with friends in South Africa, has resumed a 'low-key 
track routine', according to his family.

In a statement on his website in June,
 they said: 'Oscar is not contemplating a formal return to athletics and
 his training is not aimed at preparing for competition.

'His
 focus at this time remains entirely on the court case. His family, and 
those close to him, have encouraged him to spend a few hours a week on 
the track to assist him in finding the necessary mental and emotional 
equilibrium to process his trauma and prepare for the trial.'

The
 athlete was 'overcome with emotion' when he pulled on his carbon fibre 
running blades for his first track training since Ms Steenkamp's death, 
his agent Peet van Zyl said, adding that Pistorius described his return 
to the track as 'bittersweet'.

Ms Steenkamp's parents previously said they are still searching for answers.

In
 a television interview in June, June Steenkamp said: 'There is only one
 person who knows what happened' on the night her daughter was killed.

Meanwhile, Ms Steenkamp's uncle has said he has already forgiven Oscar Pistorius for killing her.

Mike Steenkamp said the family have coped with her death by concentrating on her life rather than how she died.

Support: Pistorius was greeted by his sister Aimee and his brother Carl as he took his place in the dock. Moments later the three siblings held hands and prayed together before proceedings began

In
 an interview on ITV's Daybreak, Mr Steenkamp said: 'I think from the 
beginning and onset that we decided that we could never be sidetracked 
from Reeva's life, and I think that's helped us tremendously.

'I
 just think of Reeva's life. How happy she was, and what she actually 
meant to the family. Not only to her own parents, but to her cousins and
 myself and my wife. She was an exceptional person.'He said he has 
forgiven Pistorius, who is due to appears at Pretoria Magistrates' Court
 today, for killing his niece because of his firm believe in God.

He added that the family have not faced the Paralympic champion in court but would want to know the outcome of the case.

'We haven't attended anything and we haven't actually applied our minds to the court case or Oscar's side,' he said.

'I know my brother and his wife would like to know at the end of the day why, quite rightly so. And I think that will come out.'

Pistorius's friend Mike Kendrick also appeared on the programme and said his loved ones were worried about his mental state.

'He's not doing well,' he said.
