The University of Melbourne has been named the most prestigious university in Australia for the second year in a row, according to a global study.

With five institutions in the top 100 Australia is ranked equal fourth in the Times Higher Education world-wide reputation rankings.  

Unlike the university rankings released in October which is based on 13 objective performance indicators, this list interestingly focuses on research and teaching reputation.

It is based on the subjective opinions of 10,000 senior academics who are scattered across 142 countries.

Melbourne University made the top 50 two years in a row with a ranking of 41

With research initiatives looking at creating a bionic eye and pushing the boundaries of stem cell research, Melbourne, which is the second oldest university in Australia, climbed two places from last year to lead the nation at number 43.

University of Queensland #81-90

Monash University #91-100

Acting Vice-Chancellor, Professor Susan Elliott, said she was thankful to the global education community who had recognised the hard work put in by those at the university.

“We’re pleased to again measure up so highly against some of the best institutions in the world. These results reflect a global awareness of the University’s activity by many of our academic peers.”

“The result highlights the strong international connections staff at the University have made over an extended period of time, and is a wonderful endorsement of the significant work our staff are doing to tackle many of the global challenges facing our world today.”

Just missing the cut for the top 50 is Australian National University and the University of Sydney, who both placed in the 51-60 grouping.

The University of Queensland has stayed in the 81-90 bracket with Monash University clawing back to the top 100 taking a spot in the 91-100 bracket.

Looking internationally,there are no surprises that Harvard took out the top spot with Cambridge and Oxford following in third and fourth positions respectively. 

Rounding out the top five the US took a hit as MIT and Stanford dropped from the top three to fourth and fifth.

Harvard has been number one since 2011 when the reputation survey started

Rankings editor Phil Baty said over the past 5 years we have seen a fairly stable ranking for Australian universities, ignoring a slight dip last year.

He argued last year’s poor performance could have been partly due to the announcement of budget cuts that could have directly influenced universities research capabilities.

Although he claims the current deregulation debate may have boosted the country’s position in 2015.

“Talking about the kind of fees they could potentially charge may have raised awareness of the top Australian universities,” he said.

Australian institutions also work closely with Asian universities which he claims are less well known by European and US academics.

China gained ground in the 2015 reputation rankings, with Tsinghua University rising ten places to 26 and Peking rising from 41 to 32.
