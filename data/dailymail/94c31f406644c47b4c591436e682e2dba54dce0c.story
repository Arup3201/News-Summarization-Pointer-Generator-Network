As a group of elderly ladies with ages ranging up to 85 years old, these women would be expected to be more at home wearing knitted cardigans and making jam.

However, these daring grannies from the Vale of Clwyd, Wales, have bared all for a naked charity calendar - and they believe they are the oldest pin-up girls in Britain.

The 15 courageous pensioners, who notch up an incredible 1,053 years between them, are selling The 2015 Wrinklies Charity Calendar for £10 - and have already raised more than half their £10,000 target.

The calendar might have light-hearted pictures but the aim is to raise funds for serious charities

With an average age of 71, this brave group of grandmothers are aiming to be the oldest pinups in the UK

With their average age of 71, the women have gone one better than Calendar Girls movie stars Helen Mirren and Julie Walters who were in their 50s when the film was shot.

Grandmother Jenny Stephens, 72, of Denbigh, North Wales, said: 'At our age, everything goes south but I don't care. Life is too short to worry.

'Between us all we have racked up 1,053 years but I think we all look fabulous for our age.'

The calendar, which is raising money for cancer charities, has grannies enjoying 'tea for three' - posing with strategically placed cherry bakewells and chocolate muffins.

The calendar, which costs £10, has already raised £6,700 of its £10,000 target 

All the models come from Wales and use the opportunity of the calendar to show off the Welsh countryside

It also features grannies in hot tubs, riding horses and donning Christmas stockings and Santa hats.

Jenny decided she wanted to raise money for cancer after her niece Bethan, 35, died after losing her battle with the disease.

The money will be split between Macmillian Cancer Support, Glan Clwyd Cancer Centre and Jo's cervical cancer trust.

Money raised from the calendar - which include the these photos, will be split between cancer charities

The women stripped off for the festive calendar, right, and have racked up 1,053 years between them

Jenny has already raised £6,700 by selling the calendars which cost £10 each - her target is £10,000.

She added: 'Making the calendar has been such a laugh but it's important to remember the real message we want to get over.

'Who cares about saggy bits and the odd wrinkle? We need to cherish our bodies whatever our age.' 

Photographer Chris Birchall said: 'Our calendars are "naughty but nice" full of humour and always tasteful. These are a great bunch of ladies, full of fun and not a bit inhibited.

'I’m more or less retired myself now, so this is a good way for me to help local charities.'
