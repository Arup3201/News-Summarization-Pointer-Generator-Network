An Indiana mother high on drugs kidnapped her daughter during a supervised visit, placed the child on her lap, and led police on a high-speed chase with the woman's car reaching 75 miles per hour at times during the 7-mile chase.

Aubrey Coy, 34, of Syracuse, took her five-year-old daughter during the visit in Warsaw, Indiana. After she kidnapped her daughter, police there were able to locate her in St. Joseph's County, Michigan, just across the border from Indiana using signals from her mobile phone. Kosciusko County police then notified the Michigan State Police.

Once the police in Michigan spotted her driving along a road in White Pigeon, a state trooper pulled her over.

In a shocking video taken from the dashcam on the police cruiser, the officer is seen trying to open the driver's side door. All of a sudden, Coy pulls away and the chase begins.

'He asked her to step out of the car and at that point she told him that "He wasn't going to take her child,"' Detective Sergeant Todd Petersen of the Michigan State Police, White Pigeon Detachment, told WNDU. 'She put it in gear and took off, so the trooper initiated the pursuit.'

During the chase, Coy is seen in the video weaving through traffic. The video also shows Coy fumbling in her front seat with her daughter on her lap.

In an attempt to stop her, the police laid out spike strips along the road to punctures her tires. That works as her tired are blown out and the car ends at the side of the road.

She then exits the car -- with the small child holding on to her mother -- as an officer approaches her vehicle. The officer and the mother struggle briefly, and the woman then gently falls to the ground.

Later on in the video, as other officers are on the scene, she is still struggling with the officers and holding her child.

'She came to a stop...then attempted to jump out of the car with the child in her arms and run,' Petersen said. "She kind of fell into the roadway and that's when the trooper that was in pursuit of her grabbed on to her. It was a prolonged 2 to 3 minutes to get the child away from her because she had her arms and was squeezing so tightly -- they didn't want to hurt the child.'

He also backed the trooper's decision to chase Coy.

'At that point you have another jurisdiction saying she kidnapped her daughter and now is in another state,' Petersen said. 'How do you let that child go with that person and she takes her somewhere and does something to her? I think it was necessary to pursue.'

Police found cocaine in the car.

Coy was charged with seven felonies and one misdemeanor Michigan, including child abuse, resisting arrest, possession of cocaine, obstruction of justice, fleeing and eluding police and operating under the influence of drugs.

Though the visit with her daughter was supervised by Coy's mother, police say she is not in trouble, as she didn't know what her daughter was going to do. The mother apparently let Coy out of her sight for a couple of minutes, which is when she took off with her daughter.

She was arraigned on Monday afternoon. 'I wanted to go to Oaklawn because I feel like Iâ€™m dreaming or something,' Coy told the judge, 'I have no idea how I got here.'

Coy has been in trouble with the law before. Records show convictions in Indiana for methamphetamine and cocaine possession, drunk driving, resisting arrest and speeding, according to WSBT. Last week, she was just pulled over in Indiana for allegedly not wearing a seat belt.
