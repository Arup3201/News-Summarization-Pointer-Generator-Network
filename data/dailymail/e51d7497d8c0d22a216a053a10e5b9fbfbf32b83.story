Died: Ruth Benerito, 97, helped introduce easy-care cotton after World War Two

The inventor who developed wrinkle-resistant cotton has died at the age of 97. 

Dr. Ruth Benerito, who created the material in the 1950s, died on Saturday at her home in Louisiana.

She is credited with saving the cotton industry as the introduction of synthetic fibres in the 1930s and 1940s led many consumers to turn to the the easy-care fabric.

The achievement 'is considered one of the most significant technological developments of the 20th century.'

Her obituary in the New York Times reads: 'A
chemist long affiliated with the United States Department of 
Agriculture, Dr. Benerito helped perfect modern wrinkle-free cotton, 
colloquially known as permanent press, in work that she and her 
colleagues began in the late 1950s,'.

Dr Benerito grew up in New Orleans, and started at H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College of Tulane University at 15.

The daughter of a civil engineer and an artist, she credited her parents as being her inspiration saying: 'My father was the one who believed in education. He said the only thing we would get would be a good education and nobody could take them away from you.'

Her graduation during the Great Depression meant she was forced to take a job in a high school, but she took night classes to earn her master's degree as well as earning a Ph.D. in physical chemistry from the University of Chicago in 1948.

High flier: Dr Benerito grew up in New Orleans, and started at H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College of Tulane University at 15

Inspiration: She credited her parents with inspiriting her to reach her potential

She went to work at the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) Southern Regional Research Laboratories
in New Orleans, where she spent most of her prolific career.

During
the Korean War she developed a way to deliver fat intravenously to 
patients who were too ill to eat -a method used to feed seriously 
wounded soldiers.

She explained: 'They wanted some emulsion that you could give in addition to glucose that would help the people that were wounded.'

Union: She married Frank Benerito in 1950 and went to work at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Southern Regional Research Laboratories in New Orleans

Invention: Dr. Benerito and her colleagues helped perfect modern wrinkle-free cotton in the late 1950s

In the 1950s Benerito’s research team began to look into cotton and discovered how to treat cotton fibers so that these chainlike cellulose molecules were chemically joined.

The Chemical Heritage Foundation writes: 'At the time, chemists knew that cellulose molecules could stick to each other by way of hydrogen bonds, but hydrogen bonds are weak and easily broken, making cotton fabric prone to wrinkling.

'The new treatment strengthened the bonds between cellulose molecules by inserting short organic molecules between them, rather like the rungs of a ladder. The new product was one enormous molecule with different properties from the original cellulose molecules. This “crosslinking” made cotton wrinkle-resistant.'

Driven: After her retirement from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, she went on to teach at the University of New Orleans until she was 81

The same chemistry also faciliated the ability to incorporate flame retardants into children's sleepwear, mattresses and uniforms for firefighters and the military.

But Benerito repeatedly denied she was the sole inventor of wrinkle-free cotton. 'I don’t like it to be said that I invented wash-wear, because there were any number of people working on it, and there are various processes by which you give cotton those properties,' she said.

'No one person discovered it or was responsible for it. But I contributed to new processes of doing it.'

In later years, while she continued to research cotton fibers, Benerito taught classes part-time at Tulane and at the University of New Orleans.

She retired from the USDA in 1986 but kept on teaching at the University of New Orleans until she was aged 81. 

Her husband, Frank Benerito, died in 1970. 

At the age of 86, she received the 
prestigious Lemelson-MIT Lifetime Achievement Award for her work on 
textiles and her commitment to education.
