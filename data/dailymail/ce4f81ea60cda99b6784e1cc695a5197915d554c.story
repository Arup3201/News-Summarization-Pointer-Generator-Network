Neil Lennon insisted on Sunday night that the return of Rangers to the Premiership is 'essential' for the good of Scottish football.

The former Celtic boss reckons the Hoops have suffered due to a lack of competition in the top flight since their greatest rivals' liquidation in 2012.

Lennon, now in charge at Bolton, told Goal.com: 'It's essential for the game in Scotland that Rangers get back to the Premiership as quickly as possible.

Lennon, who managed Celtic for four years, believes Scottish football is struggling due to lack of competition

'They are struggling, but new people have come in who I think have the best interests of the club at heart.

'Stuart McCall had a fantastic record at Motherwell. They need to get back to the Premiership for the state of the game up there – in terms of revenue, crowds, competition.

'It's important and I think that's why Scotland has struggled. Celtic need it as well – the competition has been missing.'

Lennon guided the Parkhead side to the knockout stage of the Champions League during his four-year spell in the dug-out, but revealed that the overall decline of the Premiership's financial situation had necessitated the sale of key players.

He said: 'It all depends on Celtic. When I was there we ended up selling the crown jewels in terms of Victor Wanyama, Gary Hooper, Joe Ledley, Georgios Samaras.

'It's very difficult to keep churning out those players, but that was the financial situation. There's no doubt the Scottish game is significantly weaker.

'Hibs, Hearts and Rangers are in the Championship and they were a big loss in terms of revenue, crowds, quality and competition.

'It's lacking at the minute, it's not in a great state. There are seven or eight teams in the Premiership who have average gates of 4-5,000 and with that it's very difficult to compete with other European countries.'

Lennon believes that smaller European countries may look to combine with their neighbours to create more competitive leagues.

'There is talk of amalgamating leagues – the Dutch league, they're starting to fall behind a bit, but Belgium have had a resurgence at national level.

'The Eastern bloc, as well – you never see any of those teams participating in the Champions League these days. These countries are trying to make a play for having a fair crack of the whip in terms of revenue or even amalgamating some leagues and creating a better standard.'
