The Sydney siege gunman was reportedly rejected from joining a bikie gang in Australia before he claimed he was a member of terrorist group Islamic State.

Man Haron Monis, who staged the fatal 16-hour siege at the Lindt Café in Martin Place on December 15, was turned down by the Rebels Motorcycle Club ‘because he was mad,’ a former NSW detective has revealed.

‘My information is that he was a nominee for Rebels not so long ago. They got rid of him… they said he was not suitable for us,’ Michael Kennedy, now the head of the University of Western Sydney policing ­program, told The Australian.

Fake sheikh Man Haron Monis reportedly tried to join the Rebels bikie gang before he began claiming he was a member of terrorist group Islamic State 

The Rebels are the oldest and largest bikie club in Australia, having some 70 chapters and over 2000 members across the country.

Monis, who arrived in Australia as a refugee in 1996, reportedly tried to join the leather-clad bikers before April 2013.  

The lone-wolf terrorist, 50, was shot by police on December 16 2014 after he had seized control of the busy café in Martin Place and held staff and patrons hostage for almost 17 hours before police stormed in.

Two hostages - barrister Katrina Dawson and café manager Tori Johnson – were also killed in the shootout.

The self-proclaimed sheik was on bail facing charges of being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife, when he stormed the café.

Monis, who was born in Iran and whose real name is recorded as Mohammad Hassas Manteghi, was due to face court on February 27 next year.

He was placed on a good behaviour bond in 2013 when he wrote a series of offensive letters to families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan.

But within a year he had been charged with being an accessory to his ex-wife's murder and more than 40 sex offences against several women.

Ms Pal, 30, was stabbed to death and set alight in April 2013 in a Werrington unit block in western Sydney.

He had been released on bail in December last year on the accessory charge under the old bail laws.

However, he reappeared in court on May 26, only days after new bail laws came into effect, and again in October over new sexual assault offences. He was deemed then to pose an 'unacceptable risk to interfering with witnesses and endangering the safety of victims and individuals in the community'.

But the 50-year-old committed sexual offences against women in the Sydney suburbs of Burwood, Liverpool, Westmead and Belmore between September 2001 and September 2014.

The assaults committed in his registered business called Spiritual Consultation included sexual intercourse without consent and rubbing of genitalia during sessions in which he apparently acted as a 'spiritual healer'.

Further court documents show he threatened to shoot the mother of his two sons at Minchinbrook in western Sydney, almost two years before Noleen Hayson Pal was murdered.
