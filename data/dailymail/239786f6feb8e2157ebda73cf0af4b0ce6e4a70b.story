There were no drop bears in sight but plenty of koality cuddles. 

As the leaders of the world's biggest economies got down to business at the G20 meeting in Brisbane today, some of their better halves got up close and personal with Australia's favourite marsupials. 

Prime Minister Tony Abbott's wife Margie led a delegation of First ladies on a tour of Brisbane's Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary on Saturday.

The G20 leaders' wives were treated to the ultimate Aussie outback experience, taking it in turns to cuddle the resident koalas and handfeed a pair of large kangaroos. They were also given a sheep shearing demonstration. 

The glamorous Mexican first lady, Angelica Rivera, was notably missing from the wildlife excursion.

Chinese President Xi Jinping's wife Peng Liyuan and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper's wife Laureen laughed nervously as a couple of large kangaroos sidled up to help themselves to the offered food.
