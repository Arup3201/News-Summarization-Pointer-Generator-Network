England's friendly against Italy in March will take place at the Juventus Stadium, the Football Association has announced.

The FA confirmed last year that England would be taking on the Italians after their Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania.

And after negotiations with their Italian counterparts, English football's governing body has announced the March 31 fixture will take place in the home of Juventus in Turin.

'The Juventus Stadium has been confirmed as the venue for England's forthcoming international fixture against Italy,' a statement from the FA read.

Italy defeated England 2-1 the previous time they met at the World Cup last July.

Mario Balotelli scored the winning goal as England went down 2-1 in Manaus, although neither team qualified from Group D.
