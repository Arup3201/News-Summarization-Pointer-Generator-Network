A keen artist, Prince Charles knows that a person can be portrayed in many different ways.

So when he saw two less than flattering drawings of himself yesterday, he was able to see the funny side.

The Prince was visiting an arts facility he set up 14 years ago which has been renamed the Royal Drawing School after being granted the title by the Queen.  

Prince Charles visited the arts facility in Shoreditch, East London, that he set up 14 years ago to reveal it has been renamed the Royal Drawing School after being granted permission for the prestigious title by the Queen

During his visit, Prince Charles was sketched by a number of artists before being shown the drawings (above)

Claire Price, 24, a former student, and Josie Deighton, 23, in her first year at the school, quickly sketched the Prince as he viewed the drawings on display.

Charles told them: 'Well, I've been mostly facing the wrong way for you.'

Miss Price replied: 'Yes, we've got a lot of good ones from the back of your head. It's been the drawing school paparazzi.' 

The Prince went to look at Miss Price's picture but on catching a glimpse of it from behind her, said 'Oh, maybe I had better not.'

Miss Price met Charles at Windsor Castle last year and at Dumfries House over the summer. When the Prince last met her, he chose some of her pictures to take with him.

Miss Deighton said she was too nervous to show her drawing to the Prince because of his reaction to Miss Price's.

She told him: 'Your expressions are entrenched into your face.'

He went on to ask her where she had studied and she told him she completed an art degree in Birmingham.

Prince Charles set up the Prince's Drawing School in London 14 years ago with artist Catherine Goodman

She added: 'He's very pleasant - he's very quick to smile. I noticed as well he has the art of giving a speech without having to learn it so he can look around at people.'

The Prince also spoke to Lilias Buchanan, another alumnus. He has two of her paintings in his house and told her: 'They're lovely and I have got them framed, they're hanging up.'

He told Miss Buchanan that he was planning a Physic Garden for behind Holyrood House in Edinburgh.

He said: 'Do you know of anyone in Edinburgh that can help with that?'

Miss Buchanan said the plan was to have something like the Chelsea Physic Garden in London.

Charles set up the Prince's Drawing School 14 years ago with artist Catherine Goodman. It teaches more than 1,000 students each week in its studios around London.

It is the first arts education institution to be permitted use of the prestigious title 'royal' since the Royal Ballet School in 1956. 

The Prince, who visited its main campus in Shoreditch, East London, to make the announcement, said: 'Drawing is one of the most direct ways of engaging with the world and, like music and dance, needs to be taught and practised throughout an artist's life.'

'I am determined that the Royal Drawing School will continue to grow as an educational resource open to all, regardless of background or circumstance.'

The Prince paints and sketches whenever he has the time, but his passion lies with using watercolours

The Prince (pictured in 1998) has used watercolours since the 1970s when artist Edward Seago taught him

Addressing the audience, Charles said: 'It's lovely to see so many of you here this afternoon. Judging by the noise, I feel awkward about interrupting you and your jolly conversation.'

He also spoke of the origin of the school and said: 'It was our hope that we could provide a space in which expert teachers could help our students to see the world through clarity and sensitivity whether that vision was ultimately expressed through painting, sculpture, illustration, drawing, animation or design.'

The school is following in the footsteps of the Royal Academy, which took its name in 1768, the Royal College of Music in 1882, the Royal College of Art in 1896, and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1920.

Miss Goodman, artistic director of the school, said it was unique within Europe.

She said: ''I feel very proud that we have come this far since we began in 2000, because I'm more and more persuaded of the need for a drawing school as a permanent part of the UK's educational resources,' she said.

The Prince, a keen artist, said: 'Drawing is one of the most direct ways of engaging with the world'

The Royal Drawing School (pictured) said the new title recognised its academic and artistic excellence

'There isn't another one in Europe, and we are being sought out by students from all over the world.'

The school - an independent educational charity - said the new title recognised its academic and artistic excellence and served to reinforce its position as a respected and integral part of the art education landscape. 

The Prince paints and sketches whenever he has the time, but his passion lies with using watercolours.

He has used them since the 1970s when artist Edward Seago gave him a lesson. 

The Prince usually depicts landscapes - from the Balmoral estate in Aberdeenshire to the mountain resort of Klosters - taking his inspiration from nature.
