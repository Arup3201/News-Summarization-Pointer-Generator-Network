Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo is likely to escape sanction from the Football Association after posting a photo of drug lord Pablo Escobar on his Instagram account.

The FA have been clamping down on political or inappropriate messages posted on footballer’s social media accounts in recent times.

Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo has sparked fury with an Instagram post of drug lord Pablo Escobar

Rojo uploaded the picture of Escobar - who was linked to hundreds of police deaths in Colombia

Sportsmail understands that Rojo is not to set to be charged but he can expect to be warned and reminded of his responsibilities by the governing body.

His post provoked a furious reaction by Instagram users with the photograph of the Colombian Escobar - known as the King of Cocaine - during the 1980s and ‘90s.

One user on Instagram, ‘maikomolano.s’ replied: ‘How bad @Marcosrojo that you admire the words of somebody who did so much damage to our country.’

Rojo’s mishap follows Mario Balotelli’s suspension and fine for breaking the FA’s social media rules in December.

The furore started when Balotelli reposted a picture of the video game character Super Mario which read: ‘Don’t be racist — be like Mario. He’s an Italian plumber created by Japanese people who speaks English and looks like a Mexican.’

Below the picture, it added: ‘Jumps like a black man and grabs coin like a Jew.’

The FA may also punish Robert Huth for tweets that were deemed offensive by the transgender community last week.
