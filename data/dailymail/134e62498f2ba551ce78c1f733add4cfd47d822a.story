A college student who signed up for an introductory Chemistry course claims that their professor told the entire class shortly before final exams that she had been mistakenly teaching them an advanced course instead.

Professor Thao Shirley Nguyen has since refused to confirm what student Lauren Firmin alleges that she told the class, while officials at the Lonestar College-University Park in Harris County, Texas, also deny any wrong doing.

Firmin said she was a student with a 4.0 grade average, but found herself unexpectedly struggling with the subject during the Fall 2013 semester.

Student Lauren Firmin claims that her 4.0 grade average was ruined because her chemistry teacher taught the wrong level and caused her to only get a B grade

Professor Thao Shirley Nguyen is accused by one of her students of teaching an advanced chemistry class rather than an introductory-level course that students had signed up for

‘I was getting 40’s on every test,’ Firmin told KHOU. ‘I studied as hard as I could, did everything in my power to try.’

Then, shortly before the class’ final exam, Firmin claims that Nguyen admitted to teaching the wrong course all semester.

‘She told her mistake in class to all of the students,’ said Firmin.

Nguyen told students she would add extra credit to their grades to compensate for her mistake.

For Firmin that meant her F grade became a B, but still ruined her straight A, 4.0 grade point average.

‘4.0 students, we are really stressed out altogether, but this just added to it to see what I have been working for, for two years destroyed,’ she said.

Tight-lipped:  Professor Ngeyen has refused to comment on the allegations since her student spoke out about it

Administrators at Lonestar College-University Park in Harris County, Texas, have denied that a lecturer taught the wrong subject for an entire semester

When KHOU tracked Nguyen down she refused to comment on the story, while college administrator John Powell said the teacher had ‘followed the syllabus and taught from the 1405 textbook’.

But this explanation doesn’t tally with an email from the head of the college’s science department that Firmin received when she complained about Nguyen.

‘This was not intentional on Ms. Nguyen’s part,’ the science chair wrote. ‘She was new to the introductory level of material and did not realize it until just a week ago.

'Ms Nguyen has made every effort to be fair in the distribution of the grades and I am confident that she will assign the grades justly. If you feel that your grade is inaccurate, there is a grade appeal process that you can go through to try to get the grade changed.'

Firmin appealed her B grade, but Lonestar has ruled against it and has said it has no plans to carry out a formal investigation into her claims.
