It took seven years for Martin Castrogiovanni to build his cult-hero status at Welford Road but Richard Cockerill believes the Italian’s six-minute outburst has damaged his legacy and made him look like a ‘fool’.

Castrogiovanni, now at Toulon, launched an expletive-laden attack at his former boss after Sunday’s 25-21 defeat by Leicester. It was in response to claims that he left the East Midlands club for a pay rise but Cockerill, who has a history of using explicit language, questioned the underlying reasons behind the tirade

‘He’s made a little bit of a fool of himself,’ said Leicester’s director of rugby (below). ‘It was a great game of rugby, a titanic battle between two big clubs, unfortunately overshadowed by a premeditated and personal attack on me and the club. I was amazed.

‘He was a cult hero here and unfortunately he seems to have tarnished that. As a club, we treated him in an honourable and professional manner. I have a good reputation for looking after players. To call the club a bunch of amateurs having done what we’ve done in the last 134 years is incorrect, isn’t it?’

Having spent most of his career in England, Castrogiovanni has some close allegiances with the Premiership side. As well as being a favourite among fans, he previously owned an Italian restaurant with assistant coach Geordan Murphy and is uncle to the children of Tigers forward Logovi’i Mulipola.

Sunday’s outburst came the day after Castrogiovanni, 33, had lunch with academy coach Brett Deacon, but Cockerill insists all of his squad were privy to the situation surrounding Castrogiovanni’s self-funded move to France.

‘The peer group who played with Castro know the whole scenario about where he was in the pecking order with Dan Cole,’ said Cockerill. ‘I want to remember Castro as the guy marauding around the field in a Tigers shirt. I’ve known Castro for a long time. He was a far better player when he left than when he arrived.

‘The exact truth was Martin didn’t want to be rotated. He then said, “if you’re not going to play me I’ll find somewhere else”. I said, “Fine, here is the amount I would like to release you under contract, as this is one of the premier positions in the world”. Toulon were interested but wouldn’t pay that fee. In the end we ended up agreeing a release fee (£100,000) with Martin so he could go and play somewhere else. That was his choice, not mine.’

The Italian is expected to face a lengthy ban for his choice of words, with European authorities investigating the incident alongside Delon Armitage’s alleged abuse towards home supporters. Sportsmail revealed that Armitage was accused of threatening to ‘take the face off’ a Leicester fan.

‘It’s not great if it’s true,’ added Cockerill. ‘Because all that will happen is players and supporters become more segregated and it ends up like football where there is no relationship.’
