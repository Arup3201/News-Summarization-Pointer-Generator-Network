A fixture where legends emerge and reputations fall, Manchester United against Liverpool intensifies personal duels and leaves performances lasting the memories. 

Here, Sportsmail highlights ten heroes from past encounters.

Eric Cantona

In exile for nine months over his kung-fu kick, the King returned to Old Trafford on October 1, 1995 for the visit of Liverpool. 

A sea of flags waved like the Last Night of the Proms – tricolore rather than Union – as the Frenchman stepped out collar up. 

He set up Nicky Butt’s opening goal, then converted a penalty to steal a point and produce that celebration round the pole. At the end of the season he did it again, winning United the FA Cup with a late volley that defied physics.

Steven Gerrard

No visiting player has scored more often at Old Trafford in the Premier League than Liverpool’s captain, as the camera by the end where away supporters sit is most aware. 

Kisses to the lens have followed a couple of his five goals. He scored two penalties last season in the 3-0 victory, and another from the spot in the 4-1 win in March 2009 that gave Liverpool hope for the title. 

He also got a brace in the September 2010 encounter but…

Dimitar Berbatov

… Liverpool failed to win that game because the languid Bulgarian roused himself sufficiently to score a supreme hat-trick. 

In his finest match for United, Berbatov gave his team a 2-0 lead then won the game when pegged back level with a towering header. 

His second goal was the pick, a stunning overhead kick that underlined the quality he was capable of.

Fernando Torres

The Spanish striker tormented United pretty much each time he played, especially terrorising Nemanja Vidic. 

He reduced the great Serb to a Sunday League player, playing a large part in the latter two of his three consecutive red cards in this fixture. 

Torres scored in three successive games himself, and Vidic breathed a sigh when he moved to Chelsea and his powers deserted.

Diego Forlan

So fabled for his two goals in the December 2002 game United fans dedicated in song that he ‘came from Uruguay, and made the Scousers cry’. 

Evidence of said tears has yet to be firmly established but Jerzy Dudek did have head in hands after two howlers. 

His first mistake allowed Forlan an empty net, and he then let a shot past his near post. United went on to win that season’s title.

Danny Murphy

Possessed an unrivalled ability in the early 2000s to find one touch to win matches for Liverpool at Old Trafford.

In December 2000 he curled a free-kick past Fabian Barthez: 1-0. In January 2002 he converted flicked a finish against the same goalkeeper with five minutes to go: 1-0. In April 2004 he beat Tim Howard from the spot: 1-0. 

An uncanny knack that has him in Liverpool legend.

John O’Shea

Orchestrator of the biggest heist the Kop has seen, applying a finishing touch in stoppage time to steal United a win worth more than just three points. 

United were in contention for their first title in three seasons but wobbling a little. Liverpool dominated the match, and when Paul Scholes was sent off late on looked likely to go ahead. 

But the sucker punch arrived at the other end when Pepe Reina fumbled Cristiano Ronaldo's free-kick and O’Shea slotted in a goal that galvanised their challenge.

Dirk Kuyt

A favourite with Liverpool fans for his work-rate and calmness from the spot, he cemented his status with a hat-trick against the old enemies in March 2011.

His was the first three-goal haul for a Liverpool player in this fixture since Peter Beardsley in 1990 but more surprising given the shifting strengths of these teams. 

United would go on to win the title but Kuyt dealt a hindering blow – converting simple finishes ably assisted by Luis Suarez.

Jimmy Greenhoff

Liverpool would have won the treble long before United became the first English team to collect league, FA Cup and European Cup trophies in a single season were it not for Greenhoff’s goal at Wembley. 

He brought Tommy Docherty’s side the 1977 FA Cup when deflecting Lou Macari's shot off his chest, past Ray Clemence and Phil Neal on the line to delight half the 100,000 crowd.

Nigel Clough

Down 3-0 at home to a rampant United in January 1994, Liverpool fans were preparing for their most embarrassing evening at Anfield. 

But Clough rallied to repay his entire £2.3million fee in one go. He snapped a shot from 25 yards to reduce the deficit, then repeated the trick before half-time from closer range to give Liverpool hope. 

When Neil Ruddock thundered home a header with 11 minutes left an improbable comeback was complete and Anfield delirious.
