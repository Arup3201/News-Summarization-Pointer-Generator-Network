First: Mishal Husain, pictured, this morning became the first Muslim to present Radio 4's Today programme

The first Muslim journalist to present Radio 4’s flagship current affairs programme has vowed never to wear a veil.

Mishal Husain - who joined the Today programme this morning - recalled the moment she was accosted by a fellow Muslim while boarding a train who told her she will soon have to adopt the face covering hijab.

She said: ‘He complimented me on my work and then said, “But you’ll have to wear a hijab one day.” “I don’t think so,” I replied.’

The Cambridge-educated journalist, 40,
 is the latest high-profile public figure to intervene in the debate 
about whether the veil is an acceptable item of clothing in Britain.

A row over the acceptability of full-face coverings was sparked last month when a Muslim defendant in a court case insisted on wearing the veil during her trial.

In September, a judge ordered her to take off the garment to give evidence.

But
 the case made British legal history because Judge Peter Murphy said the
 woman could retain the veil for all other parts of her trial.

Last
 month, David Cameron was accused of Islamophobia after he backed a 
college’s controversial decision to ban pupils wearing the full facial 
veil for security reasons.

All
 students, staff and visitors to Birmingham Metropolitan College were 
told they must have their faces visible at all times so they are ‘easily
 identifiable’.

But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg 
said he felt ‘uneasy’ about a veil ban in a schools, although he could 
understand why it was needed to identify people at airport checkouts.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt also joined the debate by declaring that he would not personally want to be treated by a doctor or nurse wearing a veil.

The cabinet minister insisted patients should have the right to demand medics remove their veils. He said: ‘Certainly, if I was a patient myself, I’d want to be able to see the face of the doctor or nurse who was treating me.

‘I think it is very important that patients do get proper contact with the doctors and nurses who are looking after them.’

His comments, made last month, came as the Department of Health launched a review into NHS guidelines on full-face veils amid concerns they are preventing face-to-face contact in hospitals.

Asked whether patients should be allowed to request not to be treated by someone wearing a veil, Mr Hunt said: ‘I do think this should be a professional and not a political matter and that’s why I think the people who should be pronouncing on this are the body responsible for professional standards and not politicians.’

Drawing from her own interpretation of
 what the Koran said about the wearing of veils, Ms Husain said there 
was no order to don the garment.

In a diary piece for the Financial Times,
 she said: ‘In the Koran, the subject of dress is touched upon only a 
handful of times, with the dominant requirement being modesty on the 
part of both sexes.

‘One 
verse puts the emphasis on actions over appearances: “O children of 
Adam, we have provided you with garments to cover your bodies, as well 
as for luxury. But the best garment is the garment of righteousness.” 
(7:26)

Ms Husain, who is also Today's first Asian presenter, said her determination not to wear the veil was formulated during her years as a child growing up in Saudi Arabia, where her mother was required to wear an abaya, or black cloak, over the top.

She described how her young friends would sometimes struggle to pick out their mothers in a crowded shopping centre - as the full-face veil meant they had to look for details on their shoes to distinguish people.

Mishal Husain, pictured right, was born in Northampton, in 1973 but two years later moved to the Middle East where her father practised as a doctor.

After spending time in Saudi Arabia, she returned to the UK at the age of 12 to complete her education at Cobham Hall, an independent school in Cobham, Kent.

Ms Husain went on to studied Law at New Hall, Cambridge, and then a Master's degree in International and Comparative Law at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy.

Ms Husain began her journalistic career aged 18 in Islamabad at Pakistan's English-language newspaper The News.

After two years at Bloomberg Television in London in 1996, where she was a producer and sometime presenter, she joined the BBC as a junior producer in the newsroom and for the News 24 channel.

During her rise through the ranks, she had stints at the Economics and Business Unit, the daily Breakfast programme, on Asia Business Report (based in Singapore), and as a presenter of business news on both BBC World News and the BBC News Channel.

From September 2002 she was the corporation's Washington correspondent, serving as the main news anchor through the buildup to the invasion of Iraq and during the war.

She named as part of BBCs Olympic Presenting team and presented News at 10.

In July she was announced as the first Muslim presenter of BBC Radio 4's Today programme and the show's second ever female achor.
