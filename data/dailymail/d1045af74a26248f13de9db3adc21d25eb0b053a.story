A Florida pizza delivery girl miraculously survived being shot in the face on Halloween night.

Lyndsey Cooper of Tampa Bay was returning home from her shift as a Papa John's delivery driver when a man in a skeleton mask allegedly shot her in the face and nabbed her purse with just $40 in tip money.

'I just don’t understand why somebody would do that to my daughter, over tip money, Lyndsey's mother Dawn Cooper told WPTV in tears.

Survived: Lyndsey Cooper survived being shot in the face by a man wearing a skeleton mask on Halloween night when she was returning home from working as a pizza delivery girl 

In recovery: Lyndsey underwent reconstructive surgery and has had to have her mouth wired shut 

'I heard a pop. I was asleep in my room right there. It woke me up. It was just one pop and I thought it was a firework,' Dawn Cooper said.

Lyndsey's mother recalls her daughter frantically running into their Coconut Grove home clasping her chin. 

She said, 'This entire part of her face was gone. The gums the teeth, the bone, everything.'

Lyndsey is being treated at St. Mary’s Medical Center where she's had reconstructive surgery and has had to have her mouth wired shut.

Dawn's mother says she believes whoever robbed her daughter must have known her schedule because he was waiting for her to arrive back at her home just in time to rob her.

Tragic: 20-year-old Lyndsey was only a few feet from her front door on Coconut Road when she was shot in the face for her tip money she earned delivering pizza 

In tears: Lyndsey's mother Dawn Cooper says she doesn't understand why someone would do this to her daughter over just $40 in tip money from working her pizza route 

Angered: Lyndsey's brother Jorden says he hopes police will find the culprit who shot his baby sister 

'That’s my baby girl. That’s my heart. Somebody did a number on her,' said Lyndsey's brother Jorden.

He told WPTV that he hopes police finds his sister's shooter.

Lyndsey's family isn't sure when her daughter will be home from the hospital but she does know that her daughter will require expensive medical care.

Lyndsey's friends and family have started a Gofundme to help raise money for her recovery. 

So far they've only raised $200 out of their $5,000 goal.
