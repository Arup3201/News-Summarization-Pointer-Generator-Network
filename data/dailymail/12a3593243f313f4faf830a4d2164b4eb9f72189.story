Football could become a much more literal term if a group of U.S. soccer moms have their way.

A lawsuit filed against Fifa by the group argues the governing body hasn't done enough to protect players from the medical risks of heading the ball.

The group behind the lawsuit are parents of young players, who claim their children are at risk of long term injury due to repeated heading of the ball and concussion.

The lawsuit wants Fifa to enact new laws which include temporary subs when a player suffers a head injury

The lawsuit argues for changes in the Laws of the Game - the sport's governing rules - that include limiting the number of headers for players under 17 and including temporary substitutions when a player suffers a head injury.

Cited in the lawsuit as an example is the injury suffered by German midfielder Christoph Kramer, who continued playing for 14 minutes in the World Cup final after suffering a nasty collision.

He later admitted he could not remember the entire first half of the game.

The lawsuit accuses Fifa of being 'careless and negligent' in its duty to provide players with proper protection from concussion.

It states: 'There is an epidemic of concussion injuries in soccer at all levels around the world, including in the United States, from youth to professionals, from elite players to children playing for the first time, women and men, girls and boys.

The lawsuit cites the example of Christoph Kramer in the World Cup final. The Germany midfielder played on for 14 minutes after a collision before he collapsed and was substituted

'Fifa presides over this epidemic, and is one of its primary causes.'

Earlier this month Dr Michael Grey, a motor neuro-science expert at the University of Birmingham, called for children to be completed banned from heading the ball.

The expert said the impact of the brain against the skull causes damage and childrenâ€™s neck muscles are not developed enough to handle the shock of impact.

Former Irish international Kevin Kilbane told the Daily Telegraph: 'Football is a contact sport and you are putting your body on the line, so of course there are risks.

'I'm not sure exactly how they would count the number of headers anyway.'
