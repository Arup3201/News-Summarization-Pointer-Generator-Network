Chelsea are being kept updated on Douglas Costa's fitness ahead of a £20million summer swoop.

The Brazil international is a long-term target of Jose Mourinho, who is keen to bring the Shakhtar Donestsk midfielder to Stamford Bridge.

And the Blues will revive their interest in the 24-year-old ahead of next season provided they receive assurances over a long-standing knee concern.

Chelsea are being regularly updated on Costa's fitness and will press ahead with a move if they are satisfied with the joint in question.

Costa will spark a transfer scramble this summer with Shakhtar Donetsk ready to sell their prized-asset.

Shakhtar chiefs are now open to selling Costa and talks with third parties over his departure are underway.

The Ukrainian side hope to spark a bidding war for the midfielder in attempt to maximise his transfer fee, with a starting price of £25million.

Costa is open to joining a Barclays Premier League club, but wants to be playing Champions League football.

However, a host of Europe's top sides will also be in the running to land Costa this summer, Real Madrid and Barcelona among them.

Arsenal have had Costa watched extensively, while Manchester United and Liverpool have both been linked with a move.

But Chelsea are set to lead the charge having tracked the Brazil international for two years.

Despite playing for Brazil, Costa has dual Portuguese nationality so should not face work permit issues.
