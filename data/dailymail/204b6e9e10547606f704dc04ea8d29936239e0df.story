More than a million people are taking part in an informal vote on whether Catalonia should split from the rest of Spain. 

The Spanish judiciary has ruled the vote unconstitutional but the regional Catalan government has gone ahead with the vote. 

Spain's constitutional court suspended earlier plans for a referendum on independence.

The Catalan government said that more than 1.1 million of the 5.4 million eligible voters had voted by 1pm local time at polling stations manned with more than 40,000 volunteers.

Among the voters was Bayern Munich's Catalan coach Pep Guardiola. 

Voters will be asked whether they want a Catalan state and whether that state should be independent. 

'Despite the enormous impediments, we have been able to get out the ballot boxes and vote,' regional president Artur Mas said after depositing his ballot at a school in Barcelona. 

Mr Mas warned the Spanish government against any attempt to halt the vote.

He said: 'I don't know what they will do, it does not depend on us, but if they have a minimum of common sense I think any action out of the ordinary would be a direct attack on democracy and a direct attack on fundamental rights.'

He went on to say the vote, which lacks guarantees such as an electoral roll, is only symbolic. However it is hoped a strong vote of support will put more pressure on the central government to open negotiations over more tax and political autonomy, ultimately leading to a full-blown independence referendum.

Polls show that the majority of Catalonia's 7.5 million inhabitants want an official vote on independence while around half support breaking centuries-old ties with Spain. 

There was a festive atmosphere as hundreds lined up in front of another school in Barcelona, with some wearing pro-independence regalia.

'I voted for independence because I've always felt very Catalan,' said Nuria Silvestre, a 44-year-old teacher. 'Maybe I wasn't so radical before, but the fact that they are prohibiting (the vote) from Madrid has made me.'

Catalan TV showed similar lines of voters across the region.

In response to the informal vote, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy urged the region to return to 'sanity' and for talks 'within the legal framework of the constitution'.

He said the vote would be 'neither a referendum nor a consultation nor anything of the sort'.

He added: 'What is certain is that it will not have any effect.'

Spanish state prosecutors have announced they will open an investigation to determine if by holding the informal vote in defiance of the court's suspension the Catalan government has broken the law.

Catalonia has seen rallies of hundreds of thousands of pro-independence supporters for the past three years. 

It is a wealthy region of 7.5 million people and contributes more to the Spanish economy than it gets back through central government funds. Economic and cultural grievances have fuelled Catalan nationalism.

Catalonia's push for independence comes two months after Scots voted to remain in the United Kingdom. 

Mr Mas said after the defeat of the 'Yes' campaign: 'This is a powerful and strong message that the UK is sending to the entire world - that if there is such a conflict elsewhere in the world, you have the right way to try to resolve these differences,' 

'So it is not a setback, it is a very positive message for us and should be for the central institutions in Madrid.'
