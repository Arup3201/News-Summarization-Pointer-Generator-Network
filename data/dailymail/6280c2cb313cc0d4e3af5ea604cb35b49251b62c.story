A 20-year-old has been arrested in the fatal shootings of his parents at their home in a gated community in Houston, Texas.

The Fort Bend County sheriff's office said Ryan Walton was arrested Saturday in the Rosenberg area, about 20 miles south of Katy.

The arrest comes after a statewideÂ  search for Walton after the bodies of Michael Walton, 54, and Lynda Walton, 52, were found inside their $1.4 million home in the Lake Pointe Estates subdivision in Katy.

Murder charges: Ryan Walton's parents Lynda and Michael Walton were found shot to death inside their home Thursday

Ryan Walton was named as a person of interest when he was the only one of the Waltons' children police could not locate.

KHOU reports that the Waltons had a total of four children including 28-year-old son named Donald, a 24-year-old son called Derrick and an 18-year-old daughter named Shelby.

The Waltons were shot with a small caliber pistol.

ABC13 reports that Lynda Rosenberg's BMW convertible was caught on surveillance footage leaving the subdivision at 9am Thursday morning.

Investigators spotted the vehicle in Rosenberg on Saturday and arrested Walton at 2M's Malt and Burger Mart.

Walton
 faces two charges of murder. He was being held without bond in the Fort
 Bend County Jail. Jail records did not list an attorney for him.

Ryan Walton was a one-time Texas A&M student but no longer attends the college.

Authorities say Walton moved out of his parents' home three weeks ago.

Sheriff Troy Nehls said the family was troubled.

Gated community: The Waltons lived in a house valued at $1.4 million in a gated community in Katy

Friction: Sheriff Troy Nehls says there was 'friction' within the family, but did not elaborate

'I think that were was some friction within that family, but to the extent of that friction, I cannot answer,' he told ABC13.

The murder weapon has not been located.

The family were well-known in the community, and Michael Walton was the developer of the subdivision where they lived.

KHOU reports that because of their prominence, many in the neighborhood nicknamed their home 'the Governor's Mansion.'

The community is guarded and gated 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Shelby Walton is due to graduate from Katy High School next week.
