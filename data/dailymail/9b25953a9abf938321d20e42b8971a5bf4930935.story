CERN's Large Hadron Collider will be turned back on in March - at double power, scientists revealed today. 

The world's biggest particle collider, located near Geneva, has been undergoing a two-year refit.

Work is now 'in full swing' to start circulating proton beams again in March, with the first collisions due by May, the European Organization for Nuclear Research said.

'With this new energy level, the (collider) will open new horizons for physics and for future discoveries,' CERN Director General Rolf Heuer said in a statement.

'I'm looking forward to seeing what nature has in store for us.'

CERN's collider is buried in a 27-km (17-mile) tunnel straddling the Franco-Swiss border at the foot of the Jura mountains. 

The entire machine is already almost cooled to 1.9 degrees above absolute zero in preparation for the next three-year run.

The first run, carried out at lower power, led in 2012 to confirmation of the existence of the Higgs boson particle, which explains how fundamental matter took on the mass to form stars and planets.

That discovery was a landmark in physics but there are still plenty of other mysteries to be unraveled, including the nature of 'dark matter' and 'dark energy'.

Latest calculations suggest that dark matter accounts for 27 percent of the universe and dark energy, which drives galaxies apart, 68 percent, while the visible matter observed in galaxies, stars and planets makes up just 5 percent.

Scientists look at a section of the LHC while it is switched off. A year ago, the world's largest particle collider made one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science, identifying what is believed to be the Higgs Boson -- the long-sought maker of mass

Other unsolved questions include the relative lack of antimatter in the universe, when equal amounts of matter and antimatter were created in the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago, and the possible existence of other new kinds of particles.

Many physicists favor a yet-to-be-proven theory known as super-symmetry, in which all basic particles have a heavier but invisible 'super' partner.

Getting to grips with such issues requires deeper insights into the building blocks of the cosmos, which researchers hope to achieve by turning up the dial at CERN to higher energies.

'We have unfinished business with understanding the universe,' said Tara Shears, a physics professor at the University of Liverpool, who works on one of the four main experiments at the collider.

As engineers focus on the technical mission, physicists are sifting through the mountains of data that the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has churned out since 2010, for there could be more nuggets to find.

'The things that are easy to spot have already been exploited, and now we're taking another look,' said Tiziano Camporesi of CERN, noting wryly that dealing with the unknown was, well, unknowable.

'We always say that astronomers have an easier task, because they can actually see what they're looking for!'

The LHC's particle collisions transform energy into mass, the goal being to find fundamental particles in the sub-atomic debris that help us to understand the universe.

At peak capacity, the 'old' LHC managed a mind-boggling 550 million collisions per second.

'We give the guys as many collisions as we can,' said Mike Lamont, head of its operating team.

'That's our bread and butter. Most of that stuff is not very interesting, so there are real challenges sorting out and throwing most of that away, and picking out the interesting stuff,' he explained in the tunnel, which mixes installations fit for a starship with the low-tech practicality of bicycles for inspection tours.

CERN's supercomputers are programmed to identify within microseconds the collisions worth more analysis - chunks of a few hundred per second - before thousands of physicists from across the globe comb the results to advance our knowledge of matter.

The LHC's computer screens are dark, but behind the scenes, work is pushing ahead to give the vast machine a mighty upgrade, enabling the collider to advance the frontiers of knowledge even farther

'We want to understand how that behaves, why it sticks itself together into tiny things that we call atoms and nuclei at really small scales, into things that we call people and chairs and buildings at bigger scales, and then planets and solar systems, galaxies at larger scales,' said CERN spokesman James Gillies.

CERN's work can bemuse beginners, but the researchers find ways to make it simple.

'Everybody knows what an electron is, especially if they put their finger in an electric socket,' joked Pierluigi Campana, whose team has just provided the most exhaustive confirmation to date of the Standard Model, the chief theoretical framework of particle physics conceived in the 1970s.

They achieved the most accurate measurement yet of a change in a particle called a Bs, showing that out of every billion, only a handful decay into smaller particles called muon, and do so in pairs.

For the experts, that finding was almost as thrilling as tracking the Higgs boson -- nicknamed the God Particle.

It was theorised in 1964 by British physicist Peter Higgs and others in an attempt to explain a nagging anomaly - why some particles have mass while others, such as light, have none.

It is believed to act like a fork dipped
 in syrup and held up in dusty air. While some dust slips through 
cleanly, most gets sticky - in other words, acquires mass. With mass 
comes gravity, which pulls particles together.

The Standard Model is a trusty conceptual vehicle but it still lacks an explanation for gravity, nor does it account for dark matter and dark energy, which comprise most of the cosmos and whose existence is inferred from their impact on ordinary matter.

Some physicists champion supersymmetry, the notion that there are novel particles which mirror each known particle.

'We have a theory that describes all the stuff around us, all the ordinary, visible matter that makes up the Universe. Except, the problem is, it doesn't. It makes up around five percent of the Universe,' said Gillies.

The LHC replaced the Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP), which ran from 1989 to 2000. I

It came online in 2008, but ran into problems, forcing a year-long refit.

It went on to reach a collision level of eight teraelectron volts (TeV) -- an energy measure -- compared to the LEP's 0.2 TeV.

After the 50 million Swiss franc ($54-million, million-euro) upgrade, the target is 14 TeV, meaning bigger bangs and clearer snapshots.

''Every time we pass a significant amount of data collected, someone will find an excuse to open a bottle of champagne,' said physicist Joel Goldstein, glancing at a lab corner piled with empties.'We're going to run out of space eventually!'
