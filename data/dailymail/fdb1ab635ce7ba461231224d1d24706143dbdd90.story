An Australian woman who served eight months in an Indonesian jail for drug charges says she is happy to be free, but doesn't want to return Down Under.

Julie Anne Joseph was arrested on the holiday island of Lombok last year after she was found with crystal meth, but is now upset she is being deported from the country she has made her home.

Police assisted the 32-year-old after she was involved in a motorcycle accident, but grew suspicious of her behaviour. They found 1.72 grams of crystal meth when they searched her handbag.

The woman was released from Mataram Prison on Thursday and although she covered her face with a scarf as she left the premises she couldn't hide her joy.

The mother of two is now set to be deported back to Australia, after she was released into immigration custody where she will remain until she can present her passport.

Joseph has two young kids back home in Australia, aged four and six

Joseph says she considers Bali her home, and regrets that she is banned from returning to Indonesia for six months, despite the fact she has a two children, aged four and six, back home in Australia.

'My home, my clothes, my pet dog are all in Bali,' she said.

'But because this is an Indonesian government regulation, I'll just follow it.'

Her kids are said to have visited her in jail, along with some of her friends. Joseph said she hopes to return to Indonesia some day.

During her trial Joseph apologised to the court and pleaded for a short sentence for the sake of her two young children.

However prosecutors pushed for charges carrying a maximum sentence of four years, despite accepting that the meth was for the single mother's personal use.

The former truck driver was sentenced to eight month and given credit for time she had already served before the trial.

At her trial, the court heard Joseph was in 'a state of depression' when she accepted the small package of meth from a man she had just met in a bar in the tourist area of Senggigi.

The head of prison security, Purniawal, told reporters that while in prison, she had mastered the Indonesian language, attended yoga classes and Christian religious instruction.

'We believe that she will continue behaving well and hopefully, her life will improve and we will never meet again in prison,' he said.
