The CFDA awards is one of fashion's most glittering affairs - and that was most certainly reflected in the dress code.

Rihanna, Solange Knowles, Blake Lively and Naomi Campbell all championed sparkling metallics at last night's glamorous ceremony, organised by The Council of Fashion Designers of America.

Rihanna, who was named 'Fashion Icon' at the awards, was undoubtedly the centre of attention at the New York event: the Diamonds singer stepped out in a daring, totally sheer embellished halter dress which showed off every inch of her slim figure.

The ultimate golden girl: Rihanna, who scooped the fashion icon award at last night's CFDA awards, led the metallic trend in her blinging Adam Selman gown

The revealing outfit was custom-made by designer Adam Selman and comprised of a
 total of 216,000 Swarovski crystals.

The singer completed her look with a blinged-out Adam Selman headscarf and gloves.

Another famous face to trial the metallic trend was Solange Knowles, who shimmered in a pewter Calvin Klein Collection gown, which she complemented with big hair and a bright pink lip.

Blake Lively - fast becoming our number one style crush - stood out in a sea of floor-length gowns by going short and sweet in an abbreviated Sixties-style gold minidress from designer Michael Kors.

Stylist Rachel Zoe wore a bespoke gold metallic dress, which she designed herself, while supermodel Naomi Campbell dazzled in a plunging floor-length metallic silver gown.

Speaking about last night's trend, celebrity stylist Alex Longmore said: 'Metallics are the A-listers favourite choice at the moment.

'They are glamorous, ooze screen goddess appeal and look great under the paparazzi flash-bulbs.

'Metallics rarely take a bad picture, that's because they are just so flattering to wear. The silver, gold and bronzes even out skin tone and suit most hair colours. The trick is to make sure you don't look like a Christmas bauble, a la Solonge last night at the CFDA's.

'This look is all about making a little go a long way, Blake Lively got it spot on in Micheal Kors, keeping the detailing simple and skirt length short.'

Metallics were hot at the SS14 shows with designers using the trend to create sculpting, shimmering and flattering designs.

Alber Elbaz of Lanvin, offered up a breathtaking silver jumpsuit which became the talk of Fashion Week.

Antonio Berardi and Balmain also embraced shimmering silvers, while Dolce & Gabbana gave their designs the golden touch.

Tom Ford and Christopher Kane opted for futuristic iridescents, while Julien Macdonald sent nearly all of his models down the runway in his beloved metallics.

Fashion writer Simon Glazin added: 'With every season comes a new set of trends, but some never go away. Metallics is always a big story, especially during the spring/summer months.

'There's a new metallic that is emerging
 lately, which is more fairy-dust glitter than liquid metal. Rihanna - 
although I personally think her CDFA outfit choice is horrible and 
classless - shows off the high-octane trend of the moment.
