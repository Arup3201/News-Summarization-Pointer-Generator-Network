England took the seismic decision to sack their best player on Tuesday as the fallout from the worst Ashes tour in their history claimed its most high-profile victim in Kevin Pietersen.

Paul Downton, the new managing director of the England team, made the huge call to dismiss Pietersen — the leading runscorer in their history — just three days after overseeing the departure of their most successful coach Andy Flower.

Downton on Tuesday met England captain Alastair Cook and one-day coach Ashley Giles in a hotel opposite Lord’s and they reached the ‘unanimous’ conclusion that Pietersen, after almost as many controversies as runs, is more trouble than he is worth.

On Thursday the batsman posted this message on Twitter: 'So sad that this will now be the last time I leave a field in an England shirt... Incredibly…' with a link to an Instagram picture of him trudging off the Sydney Cricket Ground.

Shane Warne leapt to his friend's defence, calling the decision a disgrace: 'I also just heard the sad news re KP that he has played his last game for England, to me it's a disgrace & a joke ! The ECB is in a shambles'.

And his England and Surrey team-mate Chris Tremlett tweeted: 'Sad to see what has happened with @KP24.Been a great player for England and a match winner. I wish him all the best in the future.'

The gifted maverick will not be 
considered for the one-day tour of West Indies and the World Twenty20 
that follows next month, meaning an England career of 104 Tests, 23 
hundreds and more than 8,000 runs has reached its end.

‘Clearly this has been a tough decision,’ said Downton. ‘Kevin has been an outstanding player for England.

‘However,
 there was a need to begin the long-term planning after the Australia 
tour. Therefore we have decided that the time is right to look to the 
future and start to rebuild not only the team but also the team ethic 
and philosophy.’

It was
 the only clue in a bland statement as to the real reasons behind 
Pietersen’s departure, which Sportsmail understands centres on his 
attitude, particularly towards the end of the Ashes, and what is 
perceived to be his poor influence on younger members of the team.

‘Playing
 cricket for my country has been an honour,’ said the South African-born
 Pietersen, who chose his mother’s country in 2004. ‘Every time I pulled
 on the England shirt was a moment of huge pride for me and something 
that will live with me for ever.

‘I
 believe I have a great deal still to give as a cricketer. I will 
continue to play but deeply regret it won’t be for England.’

Pietersen’s
 departure is the biggest example yet of the dismantling of the England 
team in the wake of their horror showing in Australia. Jonathan Trott, 
Graeme Swann and Steven Finn all left the tour early while Pietersen and
 Flower have gone for good, although Flower is expected to remain in a 
development role with the ECB.

Downton’s
 next job is to find a coach across all formats, with Giles the 
favourite despite overseeing the 4-1 one-day series defeat in Australia 
and the 3-0 Twenty20 whitewash.

Pietersen
 can now be expected to cash in on the Twenty20 circuit and will make 
himself available for the whole six weeks of the Indian Premier League. 
He will also play in the Australian Big Bash but first links up with his
 mentor Graham Ford, the new Surrey coach, for the domestic season.

Kevin Pietersen has been informed by the England and Wales Cricket Board that he has not been included in the England squads for the forthcoming tour of the Caribbean later this month nor the ICC World Twenty20 to be held in Bangladesh in March.

Kevin Pietersen met with Paul Downton, the Managing Director England Cricket, this week and was told that the unanimous decision of the England management, including the selectors, was that now was the time to start the rebuilding process after England's disappointing winter in Australia.

Paul Downton said: 'Clearly this was a tough decision because Kevin has been such an outstanding player for England as the fact that he is the country's leading run scorer in international cricket demonstrates.

'However everyone was aware that there was a need to begin the long term planning after the Australia tour. Therefore we have decided the time is right to look to the future and start to rebuild not only the team but also team ethic and philosophy.

'England cricket owes a debt of gratitude to Kevin who has proved to be one of the most talented and exciting players to ever represent the country and his 13,797 runs are a testimony to his immense skill.

'This decision brings some clarity now for the future of the England teams and we all wish Kevin the very best in the rest of his career.'

Kevin Pietersen played 104 Test Matches, 136 One Day internationals and 37 Twenty20 Internationals for England in a career which has spanned from November 2004 to the final Ashes Test match in Sydney in early January.

Kevin Pietersen said: 'Playing cricket for my country has been an honour. Every time I pulled on the England shirt was a moment of huge pride for me and that is something that will live with me forever.

'Although I am obviously very sad the incredible journey has come to an end, I'm also hugely proud of what we, as a team, have achieved over the past nine years.

'I feel extremely fortunate to have played at a time of great success for England cricket alongside some of the best cricketers the country has ever produced.

'I want to thank everyone for their fantastic support and I wish the team the very best of success going forward.

'I believe I have a great deal still to give as a cricketer. I will continue to play but deeply regret that it won't be for England.'
