Authorities say a 47-year-old New York man who had been for four years and fled to Africa after being charged in 2010 with raping a child in western New York, has been captured in Britain.

The Onondaga County sheriff's office says Tobias Bowen has been spending his time leading one of Liberia's public hospitals and was taken into custody after getting off a plane Saturday at a London airport.

Officials say Bowen was charged with rape and criminal sex act in March 2010, when he lived in the Syracuse suburb of Liverpool.

After his $10,000 bail was posted, Bowen fled to his native Liberia, where he was administrator of a government hospital.

After Bowen disappeared, sheriff's detectives assigned to the U.S. Marshals Fugitive Task Force whereupon investigators were able to track his travels to Liberia and the United Kingdom.

They eventually learned Bowen, a doctor in Liberia, was chief administrator of the Redemption Hospital.

It wasn't belong before his seedy past caught up with him and Front Page Africa reported in August 2011 that Bowen was a 'fugitive from justice.'

The article said Bowen was wanted for having sexual contact with two children.

The newspaper also published the Onondaga County Sheriff's Office warrant with Bowen's photo but he continued to run the hospital.

With help from the U.S. Marshals International Investigations Branch, investigators found out Bowen was landing in London on Saturday, where he was apprehended when he got off the plane.

Detectives teamed up with the Department of State, Department of Justice's Office of International Affairs and the Onondaga County District Attorney's Office to make their move.

Bowen is awaiting extradition back to the United States where the Sheriffâ€™s office says he will face several felony related sex offense charges and an endangering the welfare of a child charge.
