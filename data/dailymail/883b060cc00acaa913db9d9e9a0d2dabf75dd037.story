Alaska has become the third U.S. state to legalize the recreational use of marijuana.

This follows a vote last November which saw an 53-47 outcome in favour of legalizing marijuana use by adults in private places

Smoking marijuana in public remains illegal, and police officers in the state's largest city, Anchorage, have been told to remain vigilant.

As of Tuesday, adult Alaskans can keep and use marijuana as well as transport, grow and give it away.

A second phase, creating a regulated and taxed marijuana market, will not start until 2016 at the earliest. 

Alaskans caught smoking weed in public can expect a $100 fine, but the full details regarding what constitutes a violation has yet to be ironed out.

Lawmakers have left the question to the alcohol regulatory board, which is planning planned to meet early today to discuss an emergency response.

In the meantime, communities across the state have adopted different standards of what constitutes 'smoking in public'.

Anchorage Police Chief Mark Mew said his officers will be strictly enforcing the public smoking ban. He even warned people against smoking on their porches if they live next to a park.

Further  north, in North Pole, smoking outdoors on private property will be OK as long as it does not create a nuisance, officials there said. 

The newly formed  Alaska Cannabis Club, which is having its grand opening on Tuesday in downtown Anchorage, is, unsurprisingly, celebrating the new law with a joint.

Its CEO, former television reporter Charlo Greene who famously quit her job with a four-letter walkoff on live television last year to devote her efforts to passing the initiative, is promising to give away weed to paying 'medical marijuana' patients and other 'club members.'

Meanwhile, Alaska Native leaders worry that legalization will bring new temptations to communities already confronting high rates of drug and alcohol abuse, domestic violence and suicide.

'When they start depending on smoking marijuana, I don't know how far they'd go to get the funds they need to support it, to support themselves,' said Edward Nick, council member in Manokotak, a remote village of 400 that is predominantly Yup'ik Eskimo.

Both alcohol and drug use are prohibited in Nick's village 350 miles southwest of Anchorage, even inside the privacy of villagers' homes.

But Nick fears that the initiative, in combination with a 1975 state Supreme Court decision that legalized marijuana use inside homes — could open doors to drug abuse.

Initiative backers promised Native leaders that communities could still have local control under certain conditions. 

Alaska law gives every community the option to regulate alcohol locally. From northern Barrow to Klawock, 1,291 miles away in southeast Alaska, 108 communities impose local limits on alcohol, and 33 of them ban it altogether.

But the initiative did not provide clear opt-out language for tribal councils and other smaller communities, forcing each one to figure out how to proceed Tuesday.
