Police are investigating a sickening video posted on Facebook showing a schoolgirl attacking female pupil in front of jeering playground mob.

The shocking clip, lasting one minute and 37 seconds, shows pupils surrounding a girl before she is pulled towards the ground by her ponytail and repeatedly thumped at a school near Bradford, West Yorkshire.

The attacker is heard being encouraged on by a voice behind the camera shouting expletives and saying 'hurry up.'

She then says to the victim 'Say it to my f****** face then' before beginning the ordeal.

The defenceless pupil is heard screaming while others surround the pair and film the incident on their mobile phones.

After the 15-second flurry of attacks, onlookers break the fight up, and pupils can be heard cheering.

A jeering message accompanied the Facebook post of the video which has been described as an 'exceptional and serious' case of cyber bullying.

Within two hours of the video being uploaded on Tuesday evening, almost 900 people had 'liked' the video and 595 users had shared the link.

The public Facebook page has been removed after the school was inundated with calls and e-mail.

The school's head teacher said: 'We are aware of the incident and the school is taking appropriate action in line with its Behaviour Policy.

'We want to assure parents that we make every effort to ensure the school is a safe environment for their children and that we do not tolerate any unacceptable behaviour.'

The victim, who received minor facial injuries during Tuesday afternoon's attack, was interviewed by police.

Sergeant Paul Robinson, of Bradford District Youth and Schools, said: "We are taking this matter extremely seriously.

'Safer Schools officers are working alongside the local Neighbourhood Policing Team and the school to resolve the matter appropriately.'

Councillor Ralph Berry, Bradford Council's executive member for children and young people's services, said: 'It has to be taken very seriously and I know the school and head teacher is taking it seriously, it's been reported to the authority and everything's been done to follow it up.'

Facebook would not comment about the incident but pointed out it has a tool on every page where people can report offensive material.

It employs a large team of staff who look at complaints and can remove posts of harassment and close people's profile pages.
