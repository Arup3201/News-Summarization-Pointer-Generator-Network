An inquest has ruled that Peter Barnes died from multiple injuries when his helicopter crashed after hitting a crane in central London

The pilot who died in a helicopter crash in central London had been diverted because of bad weather before his aircraft clipped a crane and then plunged to the ground, an inquest was told today.

Pete Barnes, 50, died from multiple injuries after the helicopter he was flying hit a high-rise crane on The Tower at St George Wharf, Vauxhall, and crashed into Wandsworth Road at around 8am last Wednesday.

Mr Barnes, a father of two, had been flying from Redhill Aerodrome in Surrey to Elstree in Hertfordshire but was diverted to Battersea heliport due to the bad weather, Southwark Coroner’s Court heard.

After the crash the helicopter erupted into flames, killing Mr Barnes and passer-by Matt Wood, who was on his way to work when he was struck by falling debris.

He was flying a twin-engine Agusta Westland 109 helicopter.

Police, the fire brigade and the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) air ambulance all attended the scene and Mr Barnes was pronounced dead by the HEMS doctor, London Inner South Coroner Andrew Harris heard.

Coroner’s officer Paul Gregory told the inquest: 'The circumstances are that Mr Barnes was fit and well and had a FAA medical certificate that was in date.

'He was the pilot of an Agusta 109 helicopter and he was flying from Redhill to Elstree when he was diverted.

'Due to the weather conditions he was diverted to Battersea helipad around 8am in the morning and the helicopter clipped the jib of a crane at St George's Wharf Tower which caused the helicopter to crash.

'Police, London Ambulance crews and HEMs all attended and he was pronounced extinct by a HEMs doctor.

'He was transferred to Greenwich Mortuary for a special post-mortem which returned a cause of death of multiple injuries.'

Victim Matt Wood, who was described by his sister Amanda as a 'big guy with a big heart'. His inquest is yet to take place

Mr
 Barnes, who lived with his partner Rebecca Dixon, 38, their 12-year-old
 daughter and eight-year-old son near Mortimer in Berkshire was one of 
the country’s most experienced helicopter pilots and had flown a host of
 celebrities including Lewis Hamilton and Kate Moss.

He had flown as an air ambulance pilot and worked on several films during his career, including Oscar-winning Saving 
Private Ryan, Bond film Die Another Day and Tomb Raider II.

Coroner Dr Andrew Harris, who oversaw the inquest, said the case would be reviewed in three months.

None of his family were at court today to hear the inquest open.

Pedestrian Matthew Wood, 39, from Sutton, Surrey, died from severe burns and a leg injury, a post-mortem examination revealed last week.

Neighbour Yvonne Humphries said he was a 'lovely, cuddly teddy bear', and his sister, Amanda Wood, said he was a 'big guy with a big heart' who doted on his godson, his brother Darren’s child.

The coroner did not set a date for the opening of the inquest into Mr Wood’s death.

One road, Nine Elms Lane, remains closed after the accident.

An emergency traffic order remains in place and is under constant review.

Rendall and Rittner, the building management company responsible for The Tower, refused to comment on whether anyone who had to be evacuated and temporarily re-homed as a result of the accident had moved back in.

However, a letting agent with a number of rented properties in the building confirmed that all of its tenants had now moved back in.
