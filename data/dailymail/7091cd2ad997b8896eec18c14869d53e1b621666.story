A shopping centre has been forced to apologise to a mother after Santa threatened to 'report' her because her child was too light.

Theresa Stewart, 20, took her four-year-old daughter Lily to visit Father Christmas at the Eastgate Shopping Centre, in Gloucester.

She said she watched in amazement after Lily hopped onto Santa’s knee  - only for him to comment on how small she was for her age - and then go on to quiz her about her diet.

Theresa Stewart, 20, took her daughter, Lily Smith, to visit Father Christmas at a nearby shopping centre. But the mother was left shocked after the youngster took her seat on Santa's knee and was told that she was too light

Retail assistant Ms Stewart  - who is herself a petite 4ft 9in - said Father Christmas then told Lily he would 'report your mummy'.

The shocked mother said: 'Santa asked my daughter how old she was and she said she was four.

'He said "You are small for four - what did you eat for breakfast". She said she had an egg sandwich, because she has problems eating - it’s what she eats.

'He said "I’m going to report your mummy". Obviously this meant social services.'

Ms Stewart, from Gloucester, paid £5 for Lily to see Santa and a further £8 for her to receive a gift.

She did not complain directly to Santa at the time because she said she did not want to spoil Lily’s experience.

At 40ins tall, Lily is above the average height for a child of her age of 37ins and is just 5lbs lighter.

Ms Stewart added: 'I am small at 4ft 9in, and Lily is small too. Lily is 40in tall and weighs 2st 2lb.

She has now been offered a refund and a verbal apology by staff at Eastgate Shopping Centre but feels a written apology would be more appropriate

'The health visitor has been out to see Lily and she is fine. She has trouble eating, that’s all.'

She has now been offered a refund and a verbal apology by staff at Eastgate Shopping Centre but feels a written apology would be more appropriate.

'It’s not about the money, but it’s not acceptable what he said to her,' she added.

'When I spoke to a man at the shopping centre on the phone he said Santa should not have said anything about the way she looked.

'He apologised for that and said it wouldn’t happen again. I don’t think that’s acceptable.'

A spokeswoman for The Eastgate shopping centre said an apology had been made to Theresa over comments made 'in jest', but which were 'poorly judged'.

She confirmed that Santa had not been sacked.

She added: 'We are aware of the incident involving remarks made by Santa in the grotto.

'As far as we are aware, Santa made remarks in jest that were unfortunately in poor judgment. Unreserved apologies have been offered to the family in question.'
