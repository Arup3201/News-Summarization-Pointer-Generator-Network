Canned: The BBC faces further questions over why a 10-minute Newsnight film looking into allegations of child sex abuse by Jimmy Savile (above) was dropped last December

The BBC today faced further questions over why a ten-minute Newsnight film looking into allegations of child sex abuse by Jimmy Savile was dropped by the programme's editor last December.

The item was spiked - despite journalists interviewing ten alleged victims and witnesses, and believing they had enough information to broadcast the story.

The corporation insisted that it decided not to proceed with the Newsnight film for 'editorial reasons' because the abuse story 'could not be substantiated'.

But the programme was due to go out a couple of weeks before the airing by the BBC of Christmas tributes to the presenter.

Sources within the BBC's newsroom said they feared that the corporation was embarrassed about the timing of the report, according to the Guardian.

It came as veteran radio DJ Paul Gambaccini lifted the lid on how the Jim'll Fix It star used his power in the BBC to dodge sex abuse claims.

Mr Gambaccini, 63, said said the world of showbiz had been aware of the claims of abuse by the flamboyant celebrity for decades before victims finally told their story this week.

ITV will broadcast a documentary tonight, featuring claims from five women that they were sexually abused by Savile when they were girls.

It builds on the unreleased Newsnight film and is based on an investigation conducted by former detective Mark Williams-Thomas, who acted as an adviser to the BBC team.

Newsnight's work began almost immediately after Savile's death at the age of 84.

A month later, the BBC team had persuaded one victim to be filmed on the record - while the others were only prepared to give evidence anonymously or under pseudonyms.

The Newsnight reporters involved were confident enough in their material to put together a script for a ten- to 12-minute package, indicating they believed their film was largely complete, The Guardian reported.

A source told the paper that initially editor Peter Rippon was understood to be ready to air it.

However, the mood changed soon afterwards. It is understood that the reporters were asked to meet two preconditions set by Rippon.

First, they had to demonstrate that there had been a police investigation into Savile. Newsnight was able to confirm privately that he had been interviewed under caution in 2007 - a fact not stated in public until Monday.

At this point, a second condition was introduced. Newsnight had learned that the Crown Prosecution Service had concluded that it was not in the public interest to charge Savile, and the Newsnight team was asked to find out why.

Some of those interviewed by the BBC said they believed Savile was not charged because by then he was too old.

The production team were asked to confirm this with the CPS, but the prosecutors would only say they did not proceed against Savile for lack of evidence.

It is understood that when this information was relayed to Rippon, it was used as the justification for quashing the film.

It is understood that Helen Boaden, the director of BBC News, was made aware of the Newsnight investigation as part of routine editorial procedures.

But insiders said she did not take the final decision on whether the programme should be broadcast.

A
 Labour MP on the Culture, Media and Sport Committee said the BBC had to
 look into the circumstances in which the Newsnight film was pulled, as well as 
claims that Savile's alleged abuse of young girls was known about at the
 corporation decades ago.

Paul
 Farrelly, who is himself a former journalist, said: 'Given the 
seriousness of the allegations, it is incumbent on the BBC to 
investigate what it knew, and when.

'That
 investigation should also include a full look at the circumstances in 
which this programme was withdrawn. What the BBC needs to specify in 
particular is what it means by ‘editorial reasons’, which can cover a 
multitude of circumstances.'

Asked
 why nothing was done, former BBC journalist and founder of the 
ChildLine child-protection charity Esther Rantzen told Channel 4 News: 
'Maybe it was just the fact that Jimmy knew everybody.

'We made him into the Jimmy Savile who was untouchable, who nobody could criticise.'

Mr Rippon said the current affairs 
show dropped the story because it 'had not established any institutional
 failure' on behalf of the police or Crown Prosecution Service.

Writing
 on a BBC blog, Mr Rippon said it was 'totally untrue' he had come under
 any pressure to drop the story from within the corporation.

He
 said: 'I decided we should pursue the story because of the nature of 
the allegations and because the key witness told us the police had 
investigated the claims. But the case had been dropped on the grounds he 
was too old.

'This 
made the public interest case from a Newsnight point of view potentially
 strong. If we could establish some sort of institutional failure we 
would have a much stronger story.'

He
 added the CPS told Newsnight no action was taken against the star 
because of 'lack of evidence' and 'it would not be correct to say that 
his age and frailty was the reason'.

Mr
 Rippon said: 'I felt it was significant the guidance was included and 
we had not established any institutional failure, and I judged it 
weakened the story from a Newsnight perspective. I took the decision not
 to publish.'

Lib Dem MP Adrian Sanders, who is also on
 the culture select committee, said the key issue was whether someone at
 the BBC had made a complaint: 'That would be a game changer.'

Meanwhile, the BBC has said it will 
make direct contact with police to provide full support over the 
'disturbing allegations' involving Savile.

It comes as a historic rape allegation made against the entertainer was referred to Scotland Yard by officers in Surrey.

A
 spokesman for the BBC said: 'A number of serious and disturbing 
allegations have been made over the past few days about the sexual abuse
 of teenage girls by Jimmy Savile.

'Some
 of these allegations relate to activity on BBC premises in the 1960s 
and 70s. We are horrified by allegations that anything of this sort 
could have happened at the BBC - or have been carried out by anyone 
working for the BBC.

'They are allegations of a serious criminal nature which the police have the proper powers to investigate.

'So
 we have today asked the BBC investigations unit to make direct contact 
with all the police forces in receipt of allegations and offer to help 
them investigate these matters and provide full support to any lines of 
inquiry they wish to pursue.'

The investigations unit is a division of the BBC responsible for security and safety matters within the corporation.

It was also revealed yesterday that Jersey and Surrey police both investigated accusations made against the entertainer about alleged abuse in two children’s homes, but decided there was not enough evidence to proceed.

A spokeswoman for Jersey police said: 'During the course of the States of Jersey Police’s historic abuse investigation, a verbal allegation of indecent assault said to have occurred during the 1970s at the former children’s home Haut de la Garenne was received.

'The allegation was investigated but there was insufficient evidence to proceed.'

In 2007, Surrey Police received an allegation of indecent assault that was alleged to have taken place at a children’s home in Staines during the 1970s.

The force said: 'The allegation was investigated and an individual was interviewed under caution.

'The matter was referred to the Crown Prosecution Service for a charging decision who advised there was insufficient evidence to take any further action.'
