More than 150 buildings in downtown Napa in California were badly damaged during the quake 

President Barack Obama has declared a major disaster in California's Napa Valley wine region following last month's magnitude 6.0 earthquake which destroyed more than 150 buildings.

The decision automatically releases funding to help state and local governments in the affected region to repair damaged infrastructure.  

The earthquake on August 24 destroyed an estimated $400 million worth of property in the wine region alone. 

The White House decision follows a request from California's Governor Jerry Brown who wrote to President Obama seeking assistance. 

Mr Brown's office believes that his state could receive up to $87 million in federal assistance to help repair facilities damaged by the earthquake. 

The funding will be paid as part of a cost-sharing arrangement, involving the state, tribal and local governments as well as some non-profit groups. 

The quake was the strongest to hit the San Francisco Bay area since a magnitude-6.9 quake in 1989 and did broad damage to Napa County and neighbouring Solano County.

It broke water mains and gas lines and sparked gas-fed fires that destroyed several mobile homes. 

The worst damage came near the epicentre in downtown Napa, where a post office, library and a 141-room hotel were among 150 homes and buildings deemed unsafe to occupy.

Napa County has estimated overall damage from the quake at more than $400 million, much of it to the area's famed wineries.

A 65-year-old woman who suffered a head injury when a television struck her during last month's earthquake in California's wine country has died - the first death attributed to the magnitude-6.0 temblor, sheriff's officials said.

Laurie Anne Thompson was at her Napa home during the quake when she was hit, according to the Napa County Sheriff's Office. 

Thompson told family members that she was asleep in a reclining chair in her living room when a TV struck her in the head during the earthquake, Captain Steven Blower said.

Thompson did not go to the hospital until the next day when she told her family that she felt dizzy and experienced a decline in mental function, Blower said. She collapsed and was rushed to a hospital, where she died Friday due to bleeding in her skull, sheriff's officials said.

'Her condition continued to deteriorate over time and, unfortunately, she passed away,' Sheriff's Captain Doug Pike said.

The August 24 earthquake was the biggest to hit the region since a magnitude 6.9 event in 1989

The earthquake has not claimed any other lives, but left scores of people injured, among them a 13-year-old boy who broke his pelvis in several places when part of a chimney collapsed on him. 

The epicentre was near the city of Napa and broke water mains and gas lines and sparked gas-fed fires that destroyed several mobile homes.

The quake knocked over oak barrels weighing more than a quarter-of-a-tonne.

An estimated 60 per cent of all Napa wineries suffered damage according to the Napa Valley Vintners Association. 

One winery suffered an estimated $8 million worth of damage.  

The earthquake destroyed gas and water mains across the Napa region as well as damaging roads
