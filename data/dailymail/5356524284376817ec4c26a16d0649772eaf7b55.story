A Philadelphia community college was thrown into chaos and had to be evacuated on Wednesday after a student pulled a gun on a classmate - and police have revealed it was all because of a fight over a woman.

Authorities arrested Ryan Fitch, 23, on the campus of the Community College of Philadelphia after he allegedly threatened a classmate for a comment he made about Fitch's girlfriend.

The weapon caused panic in the chemistry classroom - that spread to students across the campus.

Chaos: Students were forced to evacuate two buildings on campus and nearby schools went into lock down as officers searched for Fitch

Two buildings were evacuated and nearby schools were placed on lock down while police searched for Fitch.

'It was chaos!' student Elisha Buckingham told WCAU-TV.Â 

Buckingham said she and her classmates locked the door to their classroom and pushed the desks against the door to barricade themselves inside.

Many students feared an active shooter scenario and were especially on alert after last week's rampage near the University of California at Santa Barbara.

She and others at the community college are furious that administrators waited 19 minutes to send out an emergency alert - after many of them had heard about the incident from social media and news reports.

The incident was reportedly over this woman, Fitch's girlfriend. She refused to speak to the media

'Any moment, a student or a staff member could have walked into a situation and had no clue what they were getting themselves into.

'Even though people on the outside knew, but we didn't want we were in the situation.'

Fitch's step-mother told WCAU she is shocked by the allegations and called Fitch 'a good guy.'

Fitch was licensed to carry the gun, but the Community College of Philadelphia bans weapons on their campus - making the weapon illegal to even possess.
