Nick Clegg today risked derailing a major visit from the Chinese Premier Li Keqiang by accusing Beijing of 'systematic human rights abuses' and claiming he would happily meet the Dalai Lama again.

The Deputy Prime Minister said he was 'honoured' to have talks the Tibetan spiritual leader in 2012, despite the meeting plunging relations with China into the deep freeze. 

Ahead of his visit, Mr Li struck a diffident tone, insisting he wants to show the ‘real China’ and tackle ‘misperceptions and ease misgivings’ about his country. 

Relations between China and Britain were plunged into the deep freeze in 2012 after Mr Cameron and Deputy PM Nick Clegg met the Dalai Lama

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said he wanted to use the visit to Britain to change perceptions of his country

His three-day visit, including a rare meeting with the Queen, is expected to focus on trade, investment, commercial opportunities, energy and cultural ties

Relations between China and Britain were strained two years ago after Mr Clegg and Prime Minister David Cameron met the Dalai Lama in London.

China has always warned foreign governments from holding talks with the Tibetan spiritual leader, who wants his homeland to enjoy self-rule free from Chinese control. 

Mr Li's visit is seen as an attempt to repair relations, and secure major Chinese investment in the UK.

However, speaking at a press conference today, Mr Clegg insisted he had no regrets about meeting the Dalai Lama.

'I have no regrets at all about when David Cameron and I met the Dalai Lama,' he said.

'There are no plans for the Dalai Lama to be met by either David Cameron or myself again but I would be more than honoured to meet him again.

'I would hope that I can meet someone of his distinction some time in the future.'

'Of course we can’t agree on large scale and systematic human rights abuses which still continue in China to this day'

While Mr Clegg acknowledged the importance of developing commercial ties with China, he said that did not mean human rights would be ignored during Mr Li's visit, despite Beijing's notorious sensitivity on the issue. 

'That doesn't mean that we cannot in a respectful but firm way - as we do, as the Prime Minister did when he was in China recently - point out that we remain deeply, deeply concerned about the very large-scale abuse of human rights that still continues,' he said.

'Of course we can’t agree on large scale and systematic human rights abuses which still continue in China to this day.

'The many journalists who are persecuted. The very widespread use of the death penalty.

'This is a country which is going on an extraordinary journey. We’ve seen economic transformation on a scale possibly unheard of in the modern world, with millions of people have become economically emancipated, although they are still politically shackled to a doctrine which is a one party state, a communist state, which is the antithesis of the kind of open, democratic society I believe in.' 

Downing Street would only say that 'all issues are on the table in these discussions and there will be no exceptions to that'. 

David Cameron, who met Mr Li in Beijing last year, has sought to rebuild relations after meeting the Dalai Lama in 2012

Mr Li has played down China’s global power and says he wants to change the way his country is viewed around the world.

Stressing the UK as an ‘important partner of China’, he added in an article in The Times: ‘My visit has a threefold purpose: first, to discuss ways to deepen co-operation in various fields and thus spur the growth of our respective economies; second, to present the real China so as to change misperceptions and ease misgivings; and third, to draw on British perspectives and experience.’

Mr Li stressed that ‘China is a beneficiary and a contributor to peace’ and ‘as a major country on the world stage, China would dedicate itself to securing peace and co-operation’.

‘China is eager to learn from other nations, will keep abreast of the trend of the times, will actively engage in global dialogue, and will promote the 21st century as an era of peace and co-operation.’

He is also unusually frank about China’s process in modernisation, compared to other countries.

‘A latecomer to modernisation and weighed down by weak economic foundations, China lags far behind the United Kingdom and other western countries in many areas’, he added.

‘Its quest for modernisation remains a long and arduous one. As premier, my highest priority is to pursue modernisation through urbanisation and industrialisation.’

In the latest sign of UK attempts to win back the support of Beijing, ministers announced a relaxation of visa restrictions to attract lucrative trade links.

Beijing has made clear that difficulties for business leaders and students getting into the UK are contributing to Chinese firms increasingly switching their attention to rival European economies.

Ambassador to London Liu Xiaoming recently complained that progress on making it easier for his countrymen to visit Britain had been 'far from enough'.

Home Secretary Theresa May will unveil reforms designed to help the UK compete better with France and Germany for deals with firms from what has now become the world's second largest economy.
