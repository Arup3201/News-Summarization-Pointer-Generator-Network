This mother duck brought traffic to a halt as she set out for a morning swim with her adorable brood in tow.

Drivers in Macclesfield could only watch and wait as the mallard waddled along Clarke Lane with her flock of 13 fluffy ducklings en route to the nearby Ridgate Reservoir.

Onlookers said the family of ducks had tried to reach the water over a wall, but took a detour along the road when it proved too high for the tiny ducklings to cross.

Quick-step: Drivers were forced to hit the brakes as this family of ducks marched down the middle of busy route in Cheshire

Out for a stroll: The mallard and her brood were en route to a reservoir in Cheshire for a morning swim, onlookers said

'Mother duck could fly over the drystone wall, but the ducklings couldn't make it,' one passerby said.

'She then walked them 500 yards up the road to a gate in the wall and they all made it back to the water.'

The quirky scene was captured on camera close to Macclesfield Forest.

Obstacle: The mother duck was able to fly over a drystone wall to reach the reservoir, but had to change course after realising her 13 chicks couldn't make the leap
