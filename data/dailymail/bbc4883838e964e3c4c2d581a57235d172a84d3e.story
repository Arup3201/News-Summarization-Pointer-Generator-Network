A 2-year-old Georgia girl was severely burned in a bizarre accident over the weekend when gasoline sparked a fire on a slide where she and her sister were playing.

Mr Calhoun had just stepped inside the house when the accident happened. He heard his daughter's screams and ran outside to see the toddler engulfed in flames, MyFox Atlanta.
