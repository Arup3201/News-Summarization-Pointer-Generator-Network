A fifth of rape and murder suspects in the UK last year were foreign nationals.

Figures showed a total of 93 people were charged with murder and 632 with rape.

The statistics of suspects born abroad compares to the overall numbers of 555 murder suspects and 3,436 murder suspects.

The figures were released by 37 out of 43 police forces and the British Transport Police

A survey of 43 English and Welsh police forces showed that just one failed to record any rape or murder charges against a non-UK citizen, The Sun reported.

More than a third of the 210 rape suspects charged in London last year were immigrants.

Out of the 180 murder suspects in the capital 41 were from foreign.

In the capital 24 were from Jamaica, 14 from Nigeria, 13 from Poland and ten from Portugal.

In Suffolk, 75 per cent of suspects charged with murder were immigrants.

Cumbria had a similarly high rate, with 63 per cent of murder suspects being foreigners.

But in rural Wales, Dyfed-Powys Police had no record of a rape or murder charge against a foreigner, The Sun reported.

The figures were released by 37 out of 43 police forces and the British Transport Police.

Hampshire refused to reveal nationalities of eight foreigners charged with rape, explaining it would lead to ethnic victimisation.

The figures did not reveal how many were convicted or cleared, The Sun reported.

The latest YouGov survey showed 57 per cent of people named immigration as being among the top three issues facing the country, its highest level since June 2010 and up 11 per cent on a year ago.

Suffolk:               67 per cent      (6 out of 9)

Cumbria:            63 per cent      (5 out of 8)

Hertfordshire    60 per cent      (3 out of 5)

Humberside:     50 per cent      (1 out of 2)

Wiltshire:           43 per cent      (3 out of 7)

The Prime Minister and his deputy promised an Immigration Bill to 'clamp down on those from overseas who abuse our public services' in the Queen's Speech last week.

Extra focus has fallen on plans to deal with the impact of immigration in the wake of the rise of UKIP, which took almost one in four votes in last week’s local elections.

The Immigration Bill aims to build on the coalition’s success, which has already seen the number of migrants fall by a third since 2010.

Figures in February showed that one in 12 people blames rape victims for their own fate if they flirt with their attacker or if they are drunk at the time they are raped, official figures reveal.

Around 2million people suffered domestic abuse in England or Wales last year, according to statistics - down by half since 1995.

The group most at risk from sexual assault and violence consists of women under the age of 25, with women who have separated from their husbands also disproportionately likely to be victims.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest that six per cent of people think rape victims are to blame when they are drunk, and eight per cent criticise victims who are under the influence of drugs.
