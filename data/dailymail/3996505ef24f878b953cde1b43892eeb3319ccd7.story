Victim: Professor Paul Kohler, pictured outside court today with his  wife Samantha MacArthur, 50, has asked a gang of four Polish burglars to explain why they beat him in front of his family

A professor friend of Prince Edward left 'utterly unrecognisable' after being attacked by a Polish gang of burglars today asked them: 'Why did you do it?'

Professor Paul Kohler, 55, suffered a fractured eye socket, a fractured jaw and a broken nose when the four career criminals beat him in front of his family at his £2million home in Wimbledon, south London last August.

Pawel Honc, 24,  Mariusz Tomaszewski, 32, Oskar Pawlowicz, 30, and Dawid Tychon, 29, are being sentenced at Kingston Crown Court in a hearing expected to last two days.

All four men entered Britain despite having horrific criminal records and came to the UK because they believed its  wealthy suburbs were a soft target.

The head of law at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London still bears the scars of the attack. 

Speaking today Mr Kohler, flanked by wife Samantha MacArthur, 50, who was also threatened by the gang, said:  'The attack on our home destroyed the calm of a family evening.

'We want to put this behind us and to do so successfully we need to understand why we were attacked.

'I consequently want to say to each of the attackers that, if you are genuinely remorseful, you will waste no more time in telling us, through your counsel if you wish, the real reason we were targeted. 

'The pointless ferocity and utter senselessness endangered my family's peace of mind, my physical and our psychological well-being and risked fomenting issues within the wider community both in Wimbledon and beyond.'

Mr Kohler said that although the 'mindless action of the perpetrators has undermined the security of what has been a wonderfully happy family home for over two decades' the family had no thoughts of moving.

He also said that the attack had 'allowed some to push an anti-Polish agenda which sullied the name of a proud and honourable nation'.

'I would, on behalf of my family, like to finish by thanking our many well-wishers, both within and beyond the Polish community, and to stress that the actions of the perpetrators had nothing to do with immigration, and were simply an example of mindless thuggery,' he said.

Injuries: Professor Kohler suffered a fractured eye socket, a fractured jaw and a broken nose in the brutal beating at home last August

In the dock: Pawel Honc, 24, and Mariusz Tomaszewski, 32, were arrested at the scene and police found both covered in blood

Sentencing: Oskar Pawlowichz, 29, left, was captured a month later when police traced him to a property in Herefordshire and ringleader Dawid Tychon, 29, was arrested six days later driving a suspected stolen car

Images of the battered face of the law expert, a father of four and university friend of Prince Edward, shocked the nation as police mounted an international manhunt.

Pawel Honc, 24, and Mariusz Tomaszewski, 32, had been arrested at the scene when police found them covered with blood.

Ringleader Dawid Tychon, 29, was arrested six days later driving a suspected stolen car – while wearing an England football shirt – and later linked to the robbery by his mobile phone.

He was caught with a bewildering array of drugs, including cocaine, cannabis, amphetamines and other stimulants. Police also found a potentially deadly gas-powered flame thrower in the boot of his car.

The fourth man, Oskar Pawlowichz, 29, was captured a month later when police traced him to a property in Leominster, Herefordshire.

Matthew Buckland, for Tomaszewski, said his client admitted being one of the men who went upstairs and confronted Ms MacArthur.

He also accepted that he had taken part in the attack on Mr Kohler by kicking him in the face.

Mr Buckland said Tomaszewski believed that he was at Mr Kohler's address to 'enforce a debt' on the night of the attack. 

Ben Rich, for Pawlowicz, said that his client had not taken part in the violence and denied that he had been the one who threatened Ms MacArthur.

He claimed to have been at the property to steal items including antiques and was one of two men who went upstairs, where he took computers. 

The court heard that Honc was a man of previous good character who claimed to have taken part in the attack to settle a drug debt he had with Tomaszewski.

His lawyer, Rossano Scamardella, told Judge Susan Tapping: 'In short, he owed money to his co-defendant Mr Tomaszewski, the result of purchasing drugs from him'. 

Mr Scamardella said that had his client known that the targets of the raid were people who had 'nothing to do with the world in which Mr Tomaszewski mixed', he would not have become involved.

Shauna Ritchie, for Tychon, said her client was also in debt to Tomaszewski, having built up a £600 debt with him for drink and drugs. 

Ms Ritchie said Tychon and Honc were terrified of Tomaszewski after he threatened to burn down their homes if they refused to take part in the raid. 

Family: Paul Kohler with his family. They were playing a board game when the raiders burst into their £2m home

Support: Mr Kohler with his daughters Saskia and Tamara. His other daughter Eloise was in the house at the time of the attack and called police to the scene

All four men were revealed to be career criminals and their ringleader was on the run from a Polish prison and had already served three sentences for a gun attack, theft, burglary and drugs offences. 

Professor Kohler was badly beaten when the masked gang burst into his three-storey Edwardian home in Wimbledon, South West London, on August 11 while his family were playing a board game.

They pinned him to the floor and threatened to smash a heavy wooden cabinet over his head while screaming: 'Where's the money?'

His wife was also threatened by two of the intruders, who tried to tie her to a chair with duct tape. The terrified couple were saved by one of their four daughters, Eloise, 24, who barricaded herself in her room and dialled 999.

Officers arrived within seconds and arrested Mariusz Tomaszewski, 32, and Pawel Honc, 23, who were both covered in blood.

Police quickly discovered that the men were all career criminals who used their size and strength to overpower victims. None of the four, who all practised bodybuilding and martial arts, knew each other in Poland but they became friends through a heavy-drinking clique.

Tychon fled his homeland in 2012 while on the run from prison where he was serving a long sentence for theft and burglary.

His right hand man was football hooligan Tomaszewski, who came to Britain in 2013 after being released from an eight-year jail sentence. Labelled a 'very dangerous person' on police files, he is a dedicated follower of the Cracovia football club in Krakow, his hometown.

Police suspect he was a member of a criminal gang associated with the club and is responsible for badly beating other men during street brawls. Shaven-headed Pawlowichz was caught on CCTV fleeing Prof Kohler's home and went on the run.

The thug, from Tarnow in south-east Poland, has served two jail sentences in his homeland for violent assaults. 

Foreign offenders are able to walk into the country unchecked, commit new offences – then avoid deportation on human rights grounds once their jail terms are complete, spending watchdog the National Audit Office found.

It said 1,400 foreign criminals are living here who should have been turned away at the border. 

Notorious: Career criminal Dawid Tychon

Each gang member was let into the UK despite a long criminal record. Here, we reveal the shocking scale of their offending.

The Bodybuilder

Dawid Tychon, right, is a violent career criminal who masterminded the raid but tried to persuade police he was only the getaway driver.

Wanted by the Polish prison authorities and at least two forces, the 29-year-old is a violent gangster linked to robberies, drugs and car crime.

He has already served three jail sentences in his native country for an attack involving a gun, theft, burglary and drugs offences.

Tychon, an unemployed labourer, revelled in his notoriety, flexing his muscles and wearing hooded tops for photographs he posted online.

The soccer thug

Die-hard football hooligan Mariusz Tomaszewski fled Poland where police files described him as a 'very dangerous man'.

He served eight years in prison for violent offences and arrived in Britain in 2013 to continue his life of crime while living with his pregnant girlfriend.

Tomaszewski lost a job at Heathrow Airport after oversleeping on the first day and instead spent his days drinking and smoking cannabis.

His ex-wife, who divorced him in 2003 and has started a new life in Austria with their teenage son, said she was horrified at what he has done.

'I knew that he was only recently let out of jail in Poland so for him to be back inside again so soon is crazy,' she said.

The Henchmen

The final gang members Oskar Pawlowichz, 29, and Pawel Honc, 23, both have lengthy criminal records, police said. Pawlowichz, 29, who was caught on CCTV fleeing the robbery, has served two jail sentences in his native country for violent assaults.

A brunette, who appears to be his estranged wife Eliza, posted a series of messages online after his arrest, including a social media 'status update' that read 'DEAD!!'

Apparently referring to his crime, she added: 'When a person dies there remains after him on this earth nothing but the good which he did to others.'
