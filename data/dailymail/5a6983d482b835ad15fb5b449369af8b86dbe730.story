A sports fan who filed a $10 million defamation lawsuit against ESPN announcers who made comments about him as he slept at a New York Yankees game called the experience 'upsetting' on his Today Show interview with Matt Lauer on Friday.

Rector told Matt Lauer he was baffled when the stadium started thunderously clapping the second he woke up from his nap.

'Put yourself in my shoes,' Andrew Rector said.

Angry: Andrew Rector is suing ESPN for showing him napping during a New York Yankees game on April 13

'How would you feel if you were broadcast on TV and all over the media?'

Rector said that when he went to go buy a snack at the stadium following his nap, he got phone calls from people he hadn't spoken to in years telling him that he was on television.

'It happens to the best of us,' he told Lauer. 'I wasn’t doing anything wrong.'He said that once a Youtube clip of him surfaced online, a string of hateful comments followed.

'They put me on YouTube and created a public forum where people could comment,' he said.

'I’m a fan,' he said.

'I paid to go to that game. I brought friends that were there. I have a reputation as well.'

He said that even though the announcers may have thought their decision to ridicule him was 'spur of the moment' that it still 'clearly crossed the line'

The New York Post reports that Rector and his lawyer are still working out how they'd like to proceed.

'We’re figuring out whether or not we’re going to move forward,' he said, adding, 'I’m going to think about it for the next few days.'

Rector said he'd 'possibly' consider an apology.

Andrew Rector claims he has suffered emotional distress since he was captured on live television due to an 'unending verbal crusade' made against him by ESPN announcers Dan Shulman and John Kruk.

According to The Smoking Gun, the incident relates to when the camera panned to his 
second-row seat in the lower level of Yankee Stadium in the Bronx and 
showed him snoozing.

Heavy fine: Rector is suing for $10million after he claims to have been made to feel like a 'fatty cow'

Major League Baseball has been named as a
 defendant in the complaint after the clip was uploaded to the MLB 
website as part of a highlights packed, allegedly causing a flurry of 
insulting comments.

ESPN announcer Shulman is accused of referring to the New Yorker as 'oblivious', while the second commentator, Kruk, is accused of saying a ballpark is 'not the place you come to sleep'.

Shulman also questioned whether Rector had slept through a third inning home run by Yankee Carlos Beltran, which caused a huge applause from the crowd of 45,000.

Rector, works for a car rental company in the Bronx, contends his distress comes from 
being made out to be a 'fatty cow that needs to seats' and a 'confused 
disgusted and socially bankrupt individual'.

The incident occurred during a game against the Boston Red Sox on April 13.

The lawsuit was filed in State Supreme Court in the Bronx on July 3.

It also claims that the announcers used words like 'stupor', 'fatty', 'unintelligent', and 'stupid'.

Neither the announcers or ESPN have commented on the complaint.
