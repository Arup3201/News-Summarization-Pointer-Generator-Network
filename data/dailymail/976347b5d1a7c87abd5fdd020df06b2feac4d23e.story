Their lighthouse home on the tiny island occupies one of the most ruggedly beautiful spots in Britain.

There, cut off from the outside world, Giselle Eagle and her boyfriend Richard Brown will live with more than 100,000 birds for company.

Their electricity supply will be intermittent and communication with the mainland dependent on the whims of the weather as they are relying on solar power.

Giselle Eagle and Richard Brown were chosen by the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales from hundreds of applicants for the job of wardens

Mr Brown has lived on small islands off the Welsh coast for the past seven years and was was studying at the University of East Anglia when he met RSPB volunteer Miss Eagle

The couple successfully applied to the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales for the job of wardens on Skokholm Island, 2.5 miles off the tip of Pembrokeshire and as such will be its only full-time residents.

Their days will be spent counting the internationally important colony of seabirds that nest there. Some of them, such as Manx shearwaters and storm petrels, could fill the pair’s nights too with what Mr Brown, 32, calls ‘ghostly howls and shrieks’.

But to he and Miss Eagle, 27, the castaway life is their idea of 'paradise'.

Miss Eagle said: 'Skokholm will be paradise for us - we love the joys of island life and wouldn't have it any other way.

'We're both very passionate about wildlife, particularly seabirds and island ecology.

'We love being surrounded by thousands of storm petrels, Manx Shearwaters and puffins all to the backdrop of Skokholm's beautiful red sandstone cliffs.'

Mr Brown and Miss Eagle were chosen by the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales from hundreds of applicants for the job of wardens.

Mr Brown said: 'We were picked because of our experience of living in remote locations.

'We couldn't be happier just sharing our lives with birds and wildlife.'

Mr Brown, originally from Northallerton in North Yorkshire, has lived on small islands off the Welsh coast for the past seven years.

He was studying at the University of East Anglia when he met RSPB volunteer Miss Eagle of Great Yarmouth.

They met on an reserve three years ago while Miss Eagle was trying to track down a lost colony of migrating terns.

The couple later moved to Bardsey Island - almost two miles out in the Irish Sea off the coast of North Wales - where they lived beneath a lighthouse.

Now they have moved to Skokholm where they will continue renovations including repairs to the UK's first purpose-built seabird observatory on the island.

Miss Eagle said: 'When we first met I'd never been on an island before - it'd never entered my head that I'd end up living on one. I've always loved wildlife.

'But now I'm hooked on both island life and Richard, he's my boyfriend and I'm glad to share his way of life with him.'

Puffins roam the island, which his home to many birds

Skokholm is Norse for 'Wooded Island'. It's name bears a striking similarity to the Swedish capital Stockholm, named by the Vikings who visited the Bristol Channel.

An undated charter shows William Marshal the Younger, Earl of Pembroke 1219-31, granting Gilbert de Vale land in Ireland in exchange for land in Pembrokeshire, including the 'Scoghholm' island.

Skokholm last changed hands in 1646, when it was bought for £300 by one of the founders of the Dale Castle Estate, William Philipps.

The family estate owned it until 2005, when they offered it up for sale.

The Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales was given the first refusal to buy, and after a huge hundraising drive, raised £650,000 ad bought it.

The remote island is of huge importance as it is home for thousands of birds and has a slew of designations given to it.

Skokholm is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, part of the Skomer and Skokholm Special Protection Area, part of the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, falls within the Marine Nature Reserve and is a part of the Pembrokeshire Islands Special Area of Conservation.

The island is also home to 4500 Puffins and around a 2000 Razorbills and Guillemots breed on its cliffs.

The two islands populations of Manx shearwaters is probably the third largest in the world, containing some 5o percent of the world population. 

Grey seals are present in the waters around the island throughout the year, and seen basking on rocks at low water daily.

The island is probably the most intensively studied ever, with much of the work being carried out in the 1950s, and made famous by the books of pioneer naturalist and former island tenant Ronald Lockley, the founder of the West Wales Naturalist Trust, which was the forerunner of the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales today.Source: The Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales
