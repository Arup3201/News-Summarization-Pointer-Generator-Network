Accused: Patryk Borys allegedly helped bury his friend's girlfriend alive in a shallow grave

A terrified mother was buried alive in a cardboard box by the boyfriend who wanted rid of her, a court heard yesterday.

Michelina Lewandowska, 27, was shot with a 300,000-volt Taser stun gun by Marcin Kasprzak, 25, who was allegedly bored with her and thought she was not pretty enough.

She was bound and gagged with parcel tape and put in a box with two small air holes, a jury was told. 

She was put in the boot of a car, driven to a wooded area and buried in a ‘shallow grave’. 

Kasprzak and a friend, Patryk Borys, 18, used shovels to pile soil on the box and then put a tree branch weighing more than six stone on top of it, Leeds Crown Court heard.

Fearing the consequences of crying out, Miss Lewandowska kept quiet throughout the ordeal and as far as the men were concerned she could have been unconscious, the jury was told.

They ‘simply left her there’ and drove to a supermarket cashpoint where they used her bank cards to withdraw £500 of her money.

Over the next hour their victim, ‘with great difficulty’, managed to get out of the box and escape from the makeshift grave. 

She stumbled to a nearby road and raised the alarm by flagging down a motorist.

The court heard that Miss Lewandowska and Kasprzak – who met six years ago in their native Poland before moving to work in England – have a three-year-old son, Jakub. 

However, Kasprzak was ‘bored’ with his partner. He told her she was not as good-looking as the girls he saw at the gym.

He would go out with friends, sometimes staying out all night, rather than spending time  with her. He allegedly wanted her removed from the scene so he could look after Jakub without her and pursue a relationship with another girlfriend.

Both Kasprzak and Borys deny attempted murder in May this year.

Prosecutor Jonathan Sharp told the court that Kasprzak had changed his Facebook  status to ‘single’ about two weeks before the attack and developed a plan of killing his partner.

He recruited his Polish friend Borys to help and spent the night before the incident with another girlfriend. 

The following day Kasprzak arranged for his mother to take his son out and, the jury heard, put his plan into action at the family home in Huddersfield.

Using the stun gun he tried to ‘immobilise’ his girlfriend by twice discharging 300,000 volts into her neck. Mr Sharp said the two men bound her at the wrists and ankles and gagged her.

‘Michelina was not paralysed,’ said Mr Sharp. ‘But nevertheless, as you can well imagine, she was terrified and she agreed to do whatever he wanted.’ 

The men emptied the house of her clothes, which they dumped outside with the rubbish, and put their victim into a cardboard box just 22in deep which had contained a computer.

She would probably have been curled up inside with her knees tucked up towards her chin, the jury was told.

They carried the box up steps and into the boot of Kasprzak’s Vauxhall Astra.

Mr Sharp said the defendants dug a hole big enough to take the box in woodland on a hill near Huddersfield.

‘They carried Michelina, sealed in the box, up the hill, placed her in the hole, and then piled earth both around and on top of the box,' he said. 'They found a large branch and placed it across the box.’ 

By the time they finished, the airholes on the box were obscured by earth, the jury heard. Mr Sharp added: ‘When they put Michelina, who was not making a sound, in a shallow grave and put earth around and on top of her, they intended to kill her.

But by great good fortune, they failed to kill her.

‘To bury somebody alive has very well-known consequences. After a very short time that person will die from lack of oxygen. 

‘The Crown says it is plain not just that Kasprzak and Borys well knew that, but they intended her to die from lack of oxygen.’

Both men returned to the car and drove a short distance to a Morrisons supermarket, where they were captured on CCTV using a cash machine at 11.01pm.

Miss Lewandowska was spotted by a motorist at 11.55pm and police arrested both suspects later that night at Borys’s house in Huddersfield.

Mr Sharp told the court both men would admit being involved, but claim they did not intend to kill their victim.

The case continues.
