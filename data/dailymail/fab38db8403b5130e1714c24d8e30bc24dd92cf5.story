The ongoing feud of millionaire neighbours in Point Piper, Sydney, has flared up again after a tribunal ordered car wash king Anthony Sahade to stop behaving in a 'threatening and aggressive manner' toward his neighbours.

Mr Sahade, 44, who owns the Crystal Car Wash chain has been involved with ongoing disputes with his neighbours since he and his wife Rita, 40, purchased the waterfront mansion on Wolseley Rd for $11.2million in 2005.

The latest dispute led to the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal ordering Mr Sahade to stop playing loud music, stop allowing visitors to park on the property, not to prune or destroy vegetation on shared property, and not to shine spotlights into his neighbours' homes.

He was also ordered not to 'threaten or act in an aggressive manner' toward his neighbours and his son Victor, 21, was ordered not to drive on the property in a 'dangerous and noisy manner'.

The ruling is the latest in a long string of legal disputes between the neighbours on the Point Piper block.

The inharmonious block is made up of two apartments, owned by Carina Glister and businessman Eckhart Bischoff and his wife Celia, and the Sahades' waterfront mansion.

The three properties share common property as part of a strata arrangement, including the entry, turning circle, garage, and pool.

The shared areas have been a source of contention between the residents, who have been in and out of court with complaints against one another since May 2005.

The residents of Wolseley Road in Point Piper have been in and out of court since Mr Sahade and his wife moved into the street in 2005

Last year, Mr Sahade was accused of assaulting Mr Bischoff, 62, in a dispute about the demolition of a staircase on the block.

The charges were dismissed by the Local Court, and police were ordered to pay Mr Sahade's legal fees of $24,200.

Another charge was dismissed against Mr Sahade in 2007, after he was accused of throwing rocks at an arborist chopping down a neighbour's tree.

Two neighbours have taken out apprehended violence orders against Mr Sahade, one did so after she alleged Mr Sahade pushed her into the communal pool.

The relationship between the neighbours was described as 'toxic' and having degenerated to such a degree of disharmony that 'co-operation or reason' no longer existed, by Richard Buckley, senior member of the Civil and Administrative Tribunal.
