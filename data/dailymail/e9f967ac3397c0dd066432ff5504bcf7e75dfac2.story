It will be one of the most photographed Christmas trees in the world, so it’s important that everything is in full working order.

And it has been left to engineer Winston Haywood to individually check all 600 bulbs that will be used to light up the 70ft tree destined for London’s Trafalgar Square. 

The tree arrives in the capital tomorrow after a 700-mile journey from Oslo, Norway.

Light Christmas: Last year's tree in Trafalgar Square. This year's tree arrives on Monday after a 700-mile journey from Oslo, Norway

On Thursday the lights will be turned on – and they will stay on  24 hours a day until midnight on  the Twelfth Night (January 6).

The Trafalgar Square Christmas tree has been an annual gift to the people of London by Oslo each year since 1947, as a token of gratitude for British support for Norway during the Second World War.

Thursday’s lighting ceremony begins at 6pm and will be attended  by the Lord Mayor of Westminster,  Angela Harvey, and Oslo Mayor Stian Berger Rosland.

Councillor Harvey said: 'For many Londoners, the lighting of the tree at Trafalgar Square heralds the beginning of the festive season, and I am delighted to welcome all of Westminster’s residents and our visitors to share this iconic symbol of Christmas.

'I would like to thank the people of Oslo for this wonderful tree, the gift of which is a tradition that goes back many years, and has come to represent not only the start of Christmas, but also a long-standing friendship between Norway and the United Kingdom.'
