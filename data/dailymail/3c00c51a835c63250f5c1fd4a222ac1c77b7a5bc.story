Ray Rice has apologised to former side Baltimore Ravens for the high-profile incident which saw the American footballer hit his then fiancee - now wife - in an Atlantic City casino lift.

The 28-year-old, who is on the lookout for a new club, has thanked the Baltimore Ravens for their support and was keen to stress 'there is no excuse for domestic violence'.

Rice is said to be hoping to seal a move back to his home state of New York after becoming a free agent.

The running back, who released the statement to the Baltimore Sun, said: 'This is not a farewell or goodbye. The last seven years that my family and I have spent in Baltimore have by far been the best of our lives.

'From the bottom of my heart, I thank you all for the love and support you've shown my family and I throughout my football career.

'We'll always be grateful for the love we've received from all of our fans and supporters, and for winning a Super Bowl. To all the kids who looked up to me, I'm truly sorry for letting you down, but I hope it's helped you learn that one bad decision can turn your dream into a nightmare.

'There is no excuse for domestic violence, and I apologize for the horrible mistake I made. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me, and I hope to make a positive difference in people's lives by raising awareness of this issue.

'Thank you, Baltimore Ravens, for all you have done for my family and I. I'm very grateful to Steve Bisciotti, Ozzie Newsome, John Harbaugh, and everyone at 1 Winning Drive. I love you all very much, and I'll always be proud to say I played for the Baltimore Ravens.'
