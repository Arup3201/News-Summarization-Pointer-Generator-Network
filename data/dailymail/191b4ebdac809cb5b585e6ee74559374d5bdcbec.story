New video has emerged from the Kenyan mall massacre showing four gunmen prowling through a lower-level storeroom as they search for potential targets.

The footage, captured by the mall's CCTV system shows terrorists armed with automatic weapons  mid-way through the assault while many of the victims remained trapped 
inside the building.

A military spokesman today confirmed 
the names of the four fighters implicated in the attack that turned into
 a four-day-long siege.

On the prowl: New CCTV footage from inside the Kenyan Westfield Shopping centre shows four of the gunmen searching through lower-level storerooms

At least 67 people were killed in the 
attack on Nairobi's Westgate Mall, which the al-Qaida-linked Somali 
militant group al-Shabab has claimed responsibility for.

Major Emmanuel Chirchir said the attackers were Abu Baara al-Sudani, Omar Nabhan, Khattab al-Kene and Umayr, names that were first broadcast by a local Kenyan television station.

'I confirm those are the names of the terrorist,' he said, in a Twitter message sent to The Associated Press.

The identities of the men come as a private television station in Nairobi obtained and broadcast the CCTV footage from the Nairobi mall. The footage shows no more than four attackers. They are seen calmly walking through a storeroom inside the complex, holding machine guns.

The first two gunmen to enter the room head toward two adjacent rooms. The massacre, which took place two weeks ago left at least 67 people dead

Another gunman, armed with a large automatic weapon, stands in the middle of the room while another investigates a side room

The footage is believed to have been taken mid-way through the assault while many of the victims remained trapped inside the building

One of the men's pant legs appears to
 be stained with blood, though he is not limping, and it is unclear if 
the blood is his, or that of his victims'.

The
 footage contradicts earlier government statements which indicated that 
between 10 to 15 attackers were involved in the Sept. 21 attack.

Terrified
 shoppers hid behind mannequins, inside cardboard boxes, in storage 
rooms, in ventilation shafts and in the parking lot underneath parked 
cars, many hiding for hours before help arrived.

Al-Shabab,
 al-Qaida's affiliate in neighboring Somalia, claimed responsibility for
 the attack, saying it was revenge for Kenya's military intervention in 
Somalia in 2011 that was aimed at flushing out the extremists.

Little is known about the identities of the attackers, beyond their names.

Earlier this week a Kenyan government official said there may not have been as many attackers as first suspected

Previous footage to emerge from the massacre showed terrorists casually strolling through the building shooting unarmed civilians

Matt
 Bryden, the former head of the United Nations Monitoring Group on 
Somalia and Eritrea, said via email that al-Kene and Umayr are known 
members of al-Hijra, the Kenyan arm of al-Shabab.

He
 added that Nabhan may be a relative of Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, one of 
the most-wanted al-Qaida operatives in the region and an alleged plotter
 in the 1998 bombings at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that 
killed more than 250 people.

He was killed in 2009 when Navy SEALS led a strike in the town of Barawe in Somalia where he was hiding.

Early
 Saturday, foreign military forces carried out a pre-dawn strike against
 fighters in the same southern Somali village.

The strike in Barawe took
 place in the hours before morning prayers against what one official 
said were 'high-profile' targets, without providing further details.

A
 Western intelligence official said it appeared likely that either U.S. 
or French forces carried out the attack. Both insisted on anonymity to 
discuss intelligence matters.

A
 resident of Barawe - a seaside town 240 kilometers (150 miles) south of
 Mogadishu - said by telephone that heavy gunfire woke up the 
population.

A Somalia intelligence official said the targets were 'high-profile' foreigners in the house.

Foreign militaries - often the U.S. but not always - have carried out several strikes inside Somalia in recent years against al-Shabab or al-Qaida leaders. The two groups have formal ties.

In September 2009 a daylight commando raid carried out by Navy SEALs in Barawe killed six people, including Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, one of the most-wanted al-Qaida operatives in the region and an alleged plotter in the 1998 bombings at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed more than 250 people.

Military raids carried out by troops on the ground carry the risk of a troops being killed or captured, but they also allow the forces to collect bodies or other material as evidence. Missile strikes from sea of unmanned drones carry less risk to troops but increase the chances of accidental civilian deaths.

 A man accused of developing chemical 
weapons for the extremist al-Shabab group that was behind the Kenyan 
shopping centre atrocity is a former British citizen, it has been 
reported.

Madhi Hashi, 
formerly of Camden, north London, is suspected of being a leading figure
 in the al Qaida-linked group which has claimed the assault at the 
Westgate mall in Nairobi that killed at least 67 people.

The
 24-year-old is accused of being a member of 'an elite al-Shabab suicide
 bombing unit' and having 'specific knowledge regarding significant al 
Qaida members operating in East Africa who sought to carry out attacks 
against US and Western interests', The Times reported.

The
 newspaper said that while not charged with offences relating to 
chemical weapons, it is alleged that Hashi and his two co-accused had 
'substantial knowledge' on an al-Shabab department that was developing 
chemical weapons and that this will form part of the case against them.

Hashi
 and the two other men are awaiting trial in New York. It is alleged 
that between 2008 and 2012, they travelled to Somalia to receive weapons
 and explosives training from al-Shabab and were 'deployed in combat 
operations' there.

The trio were captured while preparing to travel to Yemen to allegedly meet up with al-Shabab members.

A
 Foreign Office spokesman said: 'The FCO became aware of Hashi's 
detention by US authorities on terrorism-related charges in 2012.'

It
 is understood that Somalian-born Hashi came to Britain in 1995 and 
became a citizen in 2004, but that last year his family was told Home 
Secretary Theresa May had revoked his citizenship.
