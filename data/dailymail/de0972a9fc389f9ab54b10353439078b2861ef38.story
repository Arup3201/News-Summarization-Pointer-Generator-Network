Hernan Crespo thinks the Argentina squad should have helicopters lined up to whisk them out of Brazil and away from harm if they lift the World Cup trophy on July 13.

As Argentina go in search of their first World Cup since 1986, Crespo, who scored 35 times in 64 appearances for the national side, believes they should be ready to make a swift exit if the current crop end the country’s trophy drought.

Argentina have not won the World Cup since Maradona inspired them to victory at Mexico 1986.

‘If Argentina wins the World Cup in Brazil, I advise them to have a helicopter nearby because they’re going to get killed!’ he joked, in an interview with Ole.

‘It would be beautiful. Argentina’s a great team but it’s been a while since they have made it to the semi-finals [24 years].

‘We should understand that we’re a very good team, that we have a chance but that we’ve only won two World Cups.’

The former Chelsea striker described the 2002 World Cup, where Argentina failed to progress from the group stage, as the low point of his career.

‘There’s no doubt about it, because we had the team to be world champions [in 2002].

‘We had young players, great players, everything. It was terrible.
