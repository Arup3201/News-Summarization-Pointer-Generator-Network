The number of Britons  paying inheritance tax is expected to rise by more than a third this year as house prices soar – and it will double in five years.

At 40 per cent on the value of any estate above £325,000, Britain has one of the highest rates of inheritance tax.

It will be paid by one in ten people by 2018, compared with just under one in 20 today, Treasury forecasts claim. Married couples are entitled to double the allowance, passing on assets of up to £650,000 to their children or other relatives free of tax.

As shadow chancellor George Osborne announced a dramatic pledge to increase the inheritance tax threshold to £1million

The tax was intended for the rich, but ministers have refused to raise the threshold in line with rising property values, which have gone up by 10 per cent a year in some areas. London and the South have been particularly badly affected, with the average property in the capital worth £450,000.

Figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility show 26,337 deaths led to estates being charged inheritance tax in the last financial year. This will rise by 35 per cent to 35,600 this year, and 43,800 in 2015-16. It is predicted to double by 2019.

Chancellor George Osborne has frozen the levy for the next three years, but tax experts and a growing number of Tory MPs have called for it to rise. In 2007, the then shadow chancellor vowed to increase the threshold for the so-called death duty to £1million.

Senior backbench Tory Graham Brady said inheritance tax was hitting an 'increasing number of middle-income families'

The tax currently brings in £3.1billion a year, which will rise to £5.8billion by 2019. Critics say it is unfair because it taxes assets such as homes bought with income that was already taxed.

In most other developed countries it affects only the super-rich. The threshold in the United States is £3.2million.

Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, said: ‘These figures show that inheritance tax is now hitting an increasing number of middle-income families, people it was never intended to target.

‘Given that most of the assets that are being taxed have been built up from people’s earned incomes, on which they have already paid tax once, there is an obvious case to be made that it would be fair to look at this again.’ Earlier this year David Cameron acknowledged that too many families were paying the levy and said this would be addressed in next year’s election manifesto.

But the Treasury froze the threshold until 2017-18 to help pay for the new cap on the cost of social care for the elderly. Housing accounts for about 50 per cent of the value of estates that attract inheritance tax.

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘While we are having to pay off Labour’s deficit couples can still leave £650,000 tax free and, importantly, freezing the inheritance tax threshold means we can pay to end the scandal of people having to sell their homes to pay for social care, meaning they often had no home to leave to their children and grandchildren in the first place.’
