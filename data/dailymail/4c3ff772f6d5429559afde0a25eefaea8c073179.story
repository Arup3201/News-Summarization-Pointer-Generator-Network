Rising star: Blogger Bryan Grey Yambao, a.k.a. Bryanboy, pictured, has confirmed he will join the cast of America's Next Top Model

Bryan Grey Yambao, more commonly known as Bryanboy, will join the cast of America's Next Top Model.

The 31-year-old fashion blogger, who launched his site in 2004, wrote on his Facebook this morning: 'Excited with my new role on cycle 19 of America's Next Top Model'.

Although the CW network is yet to confirm how the blogger, who had lived in the Philippines, will be involved, he has already relocated to Los Angeles in order to film the reality series created by model Tyra Banks.

He posted a photograph of his new Los Angeles apartment on Twitter yesterday.

The new signing follows news that Ms Banks, 38, dumped the show's previous judges, fashion photographer Nigel Barker, runway coach J. Alexander and make-up artist Jay Manuel, last month.

She told Access Hollywood: 'We reached a point, where we feel the show needs a new boost.'

While many TV stars, such as Brooke Bourke and Katherine Heigl, have turned to blogging after building successful careers, it is the first time a blogger will become a TV star.

His appointment had been hinted at for months.

Mr Grey Yambao, who was raised in Manila, declined an interview with The Observer in February because he was not able to participate in any 'profiles pending a project with another media outlet' that 'would be developed/released by this summer'.

The new season of America's Next Top Model is about to commence filming in Los Angeles shortly.

Sources close to the blogger had told WWD yesterday that the blogger had signed a contract with the show and was 'en route to Los Angeles with a one-way air ticket'.

He will join new cast members Rob Evans, a U.S. model and Johnny Wujek, a stylist for Katy Perry.

Fashion publicist Kelly Cutrone will also return as a judge for a second season.

Mr Grey Yambao wrote on Twitter on May 22: 'A new chapter is about to begin soon.'

He also tweeted yesterday: 'Let the public voting commence – California State ID or New York State ID?'

Although Bryanboy was never directly tied to it, the blogger is believed to have been behind the controversial gossip blog titled Chikatime.

According to The Observer, the Manila-based blog 'combined Perez Hilton's fondness for coke-y MS Paint doodles with TMZ's gutter ruthlessness with 2005-era Gawker's weakness for the unverified and unverifiable, juicy reader tip'.

Many of the blog's subjects were people who were associated with the blogger.

An anonymous former editor of Bryanboy said of the blogger's supposed involvement: 'It was just common knowledge in Manila among those who were in the know.'

According to New York magazine, the blogger earns more than $100,000 per year.

He charges fees for appearances, telling the magazine: 'But if it's something or somebody that I support, then of course I'm not going to charge.

'For me money is really not the issue, it's about getting material and getting my content.'

Using the alias Bboy777, he joined the blogosphere in 2003 and eventually built a following for himself after posting stories about his weight-loss goals, fashion purchases and hatred for fake designer goods.

Both are themes that feature on his newer blog.

He wrote a short-lived fashion column for a publication called the Philippines Star and he also guest-judged the Philippines' version of Project Runway.

He has built impressive connections since setting his sights on the U.S.

Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour is just one magazine editor who has commissioned street style photographs off the blogger.

New digs: The blogger tweeted this picture with the caption, 'My building to the left... my street view to the right'

Success: His blog Bryanboy.com, above, is said to attract an average of 1.4million pge views every month

Fashion bible Style.com also featured his photography during the Fall/Winter 2012 Fashion Week season earlier this year.

His blog, which features his witty commentary on fashion as well as photographs and self-portraits is said to average 1.4million page views per month.
