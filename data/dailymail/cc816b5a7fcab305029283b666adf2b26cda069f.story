Emmanuel Adebayor  launched an extraordinary attack on Tottenham supporters this week and claimed the players are no longer made to feel welcome at White Hart Lane.

The striker, who took an extra minute to come on as a substitute in the 2-1 defeat by Stoke because he decided to change his boots when he was waiting to get on, insists the atmosphere is negative.

We asked Dan Kilpatrick, editor of The Tottenham Way, for his views on Adebayor's comments.

Emmanuel Adebayor is the worst possible Tottenham player to criticise Spurs fans. But that’s not to say the striker doesn’t have a point.

Even when he was scoring under Harry Redknapp and saluting under Tim Sherwood, fans could never fully embrace Adebayor. He scored against Spurs too often for Arsenal and is, unfairly in my opinion, viewed as more of a mercenary than other players in the Tottenham squad. 

There’s also a feeling – again unfair and perpetuated by TV pundits – that a player earning so much cash should always be performing better.

With one or two exceptions, the entire squad has been abysmal under Mauricio Pochettino but Ade is often singled out, slammed for his 'lazy', 'feckless' displays ahead of other more popular players, who are just as deserving of criticism.

It’s therefore no surprise Ade’s claim that the squad is afraid to play at home because of the negative atmosphere has ruffled some feathers.

Fans have rightly pointed out that Ade has been rubbish away from home this season, where Spurs arguably have the best fans in the country.

Supporters will not take kindly to criticism from a player who is clearly not performing to the best of his ability but, rightly or wrongly, Adebayor was named vice-captain by Pochettino and it’s now his responsibility to speak on behalf of the squad.

If his comments had come from Younes Kaboul’s other deputy, Hugo Lloris, or even from one of the young, homegrown players, the reaction would have been different.

And even some of Adebayor’s critics will have read his remarks and nodded in resigned agreement.

There is consensus among Spurs fans that the atmosphere at the Lane is on the decline, which is why the wonderful 1882 movement and others are growing in importance.

Fortunately, I didn’t attend the Stoke match but by all accounts the Lane began as edgy and turned outright poisonous after Stoke’s opener. Watching on TV, there was an obvious absence of Tottenham players showing for the ball and ‘afraid’ would be an appropriate way to describe the shambolic performance.

Whether this is primarily a result of Pochettino’s instructions or the atmosphere is unclear, but negatively from the terraces can hardly have helped the players.

Fans will point out that they have a right to boo Adebayor and Co when they don’t appear to be giving their all. But Adebayor’s introduction on Sunday was, disgustingly, booed before he had a chance to kick a ball.

Paying fans have the right to express dissatisfaction in this way but it’s a bit like the right to freedom of expression; we have it, but we shouldn’t use it to be a total fool.

White Hart Lane remains a fabulous old-fashioned football ground and when it’s rocking, there is nowhere better, for me, in the entire country. The current negativity is undoubtedly a chicken and egg situation and if the players show more, the fans will respond.

But that’s not to say Spurs fans are entirely blameless for the club’s current struggles. Adebayor has made a good point. We just don’t want to hear it from him.
