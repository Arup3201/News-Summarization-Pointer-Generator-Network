Sir Richard Branson's Caribbean island home that was destroyed by fire in a suspected lightning strike two years ago has been rebuilt and is now ready to welcome its first guests.

Oscar-winning actress Kate Winslet had to carry Sir Richard's 90-year-old mother, Eve, to safety when flames tore through The Great House on Necker Island in August 2011.

Now the house, which Sir Richard lets out, has been re-modelled on the original design, with some new innovations and a 1,500 sq ft master suite.

Those who can afford it can stay at the house for a nightly rate of £37,500. The house can take up to 30 adults plus six children.

Sir Richard said: 'Necker Island has 
been my home for more than 30 years and for me it is the most beautiful 
place in the world.

'The
 brand new Great House is the heart of the island and I'm thrilled with 
the results. This signals a new dawn for Necker, which I'm very excited 
about.'

Set in the 
Caribbean, Richard Branson's holiday home is a by-word for luxury and 
has played host to a vast array of A-list celebrities and royalty.

The
 private island house, which Branson has owned since 1979, boasts eight 
guest rooms, each with a balcony, king-sized bed and en-suite bathroom.

The master suite has been 
specifically designed to give panoramic views of the Caribbean, the 
Atlantic Ocean and neighbouring islands. It includes a two-person Jacuzzi, stand-alone outdoor bath and a kitchenette area with a fully-stocked fridge. 

The resort can be hired exclusively for 
up to 30 adults but this kind of luxury comes at a price per night that 
few people earn in a year.

An exclusive week's rental, that includes six individual Bali Houses dotted around the island and two tennis courts, costs around £270,000.

The
 Great House was gutted by the fire on August 22, 2011, which was 
believed to have been caused by lightning from Tropical Storm Irene.

Kate Winslet, who has since married Branson's nephew Ned Rocknroll, was in the house at the time and helped carry the business tycoon's 90-year-old mother Eve.

He told ITV News shortly after the fire: 'She [Winslet] said it was like being on
 a film set where you’re waiting for the word 'cut’, but it just didn’t 
come.'

The Virgin boss said guests, including his son Sam and daughter Holly, were woken at about 5am after hearing loud bangs as gas canisters exploded.

He said: 'It was terrifying for me 
because my daughter and nephews, nieces, friends were all in the house, so I just ran, naked, towards the house to try to 
make sure I could get people out.'

The rest of the island has remained open to visitors since the fire.

New
 features include an expansive outdoor terrace with hammocks and sofas 
and a large dining table for guests to eat together al fresco.

There is also a fully-stocked bar for cocktails and a crow’s nest on the roof has amazing views.

Branson was only 28 when he bought the island for £180,000 and turned it into the superstar resort.

Necker Island - aptly for the Virgin boss - is located in the British Virgin Islands.

It is a surrounded by turquoise 
waters, coral reefs and white sandy beaches and as well as celebrity 
guests is also home to diverse wildlife including flamingos, iguanas, 
lemurs and giant tortoises.

Powerful friends: Sir Richard Branson has known to have hosted Prince Harry and Tony Blair at Necker Island

Over the years, it has attracted royalty such as Princess Diana, Prince Harry and the Duchess of Cambridge, who visited during her split from Prince William, who took advantage of the privacy the island provides.

The list of megastars from Hollywood and the world of sport to have holidayed there is seemingly endless and includes Harrison Ford, Robert De Niro, Oprah Winfrey, the Rolling Stones and the likes of John McEnroe and Novak Djokovic.

More surprisingly, it has also been a haven to some of the biggest names in politics such as Kofi Annan, Jimmy Carter, Desmond Tutu, Nelson Mandela and Tony Blair.

The 74-acre island of Necker is part of the British Virgin Islands and sits on the boundary of the Caribbean and Atlantic Ocean.

It was named after the 17th century Dutch squadron commander Johannes de Neckere but remained uninhabited during the early 20th century.

It was bought by Sir Richard Branson in 1979 after he heard some of the Virgin Islands were being sold.

Branson was just 28 - and only six years after starting the Virgin Group.

He offered a very low bid of £100,000, which was rejected, but eventually secured the paradise island for £180,000.

He was forced to build a resort within five years of taking ownership, otherwise the government said it would be taken back by the state.

According to reporters, Branson spent about £6.5million creating the luxury resort over the next three years.

It has played host to an array of the world's most powerful, rich and famous.

Princess Diana chose the island for her holiday with Prince William and Prince Harry.

It was also a haven of privacy for the Duchess of Cambridge when she fled Britain during her temporary split from Prince William.

Google founder Larry Page even chose it for his wedding to Lucy Southworth in 2007.

It was also the site of Sir Richard's daughter Holly Branson's wedding to shipbroker Fred Andrews just months after devastating fire.

Her wedding was on the same spot as that of Sir Richard and his wife Joan Templeman's in 1989 when Holly was eight and her brother Sam was four.

In April 2011, Branson offered the island to his close friend Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge for the royal couple's honeymoon.
