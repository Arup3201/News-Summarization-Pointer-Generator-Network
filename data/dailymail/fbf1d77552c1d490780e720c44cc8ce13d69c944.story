A homeless person has written a funny apology note after they broke into a man's car and stole his blanket.

Bert Palin, 82, from East Gosford on the NSW Central Coast, discovered the letter after returning home from a trip to Sydney's Redfern to visit family.

When he opened the boot of the car he found his blanket folded neatly with the note placed on top.

'Hi, I borrowed your blanket for a little while because I was cold and didn't have anywhere to go,' the note read.

'I hope you accept my apology for taking your stuff without asking.'

The person signed the note 'blankt [sic] thief' with a smiley face, before adding: 'P.S. the blank [sic] is really itchy.'

Mr Palin told the NT News that he had accepted the apology but warned the thief to 'keep out of my car' in future.

'It was obviously a male or female of some education to have written it the way they did and to break into my car then say "thank you" and "P.S. your blanket was itchy"... it was breathtaking,' he said.

'I washed the blanket after that because I was concerned about it being itchy.'
