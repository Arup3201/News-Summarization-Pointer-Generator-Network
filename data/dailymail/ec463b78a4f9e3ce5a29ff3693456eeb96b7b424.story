Hurricane Gonzalo which is tearing through the Atlantic will batter Britain this week bringing with it Gale Force 10 winds and heavy rain.

The Met Office has issued a ‘yellow’ weather warning for most of the country for Tuesday as gale force winds of 55mph are expected to make driving conditions difficult and cause chaos for rush hour commuters.

Experts are warning the worst of the hurricane will hit on Monday night with severe gales worst affecting northern parts of Ireland, Wales and England as well as Southern and Eastern Scotland.

Forecasters say Gale Force 10 winds can range between 55 and 63mph and typically damage buildings, trees and cause high churning white seas.

Forecaster Simon Partridge, from the Met Office, said: ‘This storm is what’s left of Hurricane Gonzalo.

‘It is going to reach the UK late Monday night and into Tuesday morning and bring some heavy rain with it.

‘It will be moving through quite quickly and is likely to clear most of the UK within six to eight hours.

‘There will be up to 20mm of rain, which is not out of the ordinary for the time of year, and up to 40mm in Scotland.

‘Winds will increase throughout Monday night and they will be strong to gale force in northern parts. We could see speeds of 50 to 55mph.

He continued: ‘The main reason for the warning is the timing, as strong winds will be coming through the Tuesday morning rush hour – it will be wet and windy and there will be spray on the roads.

‘Also the trees are still quite full of leaves at the moment and with those strong winds we could see a lot more leaves on the roads.’

Hurricane Gonzalo has been causing chaos over the weekend as it crushed trees and flattened power lines on the tiny Atlantic island chain of Bermuda.

The storm – one of the strongest ever to hit the island – tore through the nation at 110mph on Friday night and was still causing major problems this morning as it moved northward over the Atlantic.

Residents were warned not to go outside as the calm eye of the storm moved in.

Mr Partridge added that the south coast of England was feeling the effects of another hurricane overnight.

‘Last night it was three degrees warmer overnight on the south coast with temperatures reaching 17 degrees due to winds left of Hurricane Fay after it made its way across the Atlantic.’

He also said that it could start to feel colder this week as temperatures are likely to return to normal for the time of year.
