A devoted father-of-two died just nine months after getting married, leaving his new bride to raise their two young children alone.

David Jenkins, 28, from Solihull, married his long term-partner Ava in July 2012.

But just two weeks after the weeding, the persistent cough he had been suffering got worse, and he was rushed to hospital. 

There, the couple received the devastating news he had lymphoma, an uncommon cancer of the lymphatic system.

Despite several rounds of chemotherapy, Mr Jenkins passed away the following April.

Just two weeks after their wedding in July 2012, David and Ava Jenkins, from Solihull, were given the devastating news that he had cancer 

Mr Jenkins, a car valet, was diagnosed with lymphoma and died just nine months after his wedding. He is survived by his wife Ava and children Isabel, eight and Nathan, four

Mrs Jenkins said the whole family was heartbroken when they found out Mr Jenkins was unlikely to survive the cancer. 'He would do anything for anyone, he was just that sort of person,' she said

The couple, who lived in Solihull, had two children together - Isabel, eight, and Nathan, four, decided to get married after dating for 10 years.

They set a date for the wedding, but in the weeks before it, Mr Jenkins, a car valet, developed a persistent cough.

When it failed to get better, he repeatedly went to his GP - but was advised it was a virus that would pass.

In July, shortly after the couple married in Devon, he again went back to the doctor about about his unshakeable cough.

His heart rate was found to be high and he was rushed to Solihull Hospital where he was diagnosed with lymphoma.

The cancer which weaken's the body's immune system and leaves it prone to infection - cancer of the white blood cells.

He underwent several rounds of chemotherapy and even went to the U.S. for treatment, but died nine months later, aged just 28.

His heartbroken wife, also 28, said: 'Our whole married life was spent in and out of hospital.

'It was a massive shock when the doctors told us he wouldn't make it. It doesn't feel real.

Lymphoma is quite a rare cancer that develops in the lymphatic system - a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body.

The lymphatic system is part of the immune system.

 Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes.

With lymphoma, the affected lymphocytes start to multiply in an abnormal way and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands).

The affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection.

The most common symptom of lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin.

'I see pictures of him and I get upset - I can't believe he's gone.'

The couple met on a night out on Broad Street in Birmingham city centre in 2003.

Mr Jenkins popped the question four years later and they married in Woolacombe, Devon, on July 5, 2012.

Mrs Jenkins, who works at Marks & Spencer, said her husband was first told he had a virus when he fell ill. 

She said: 'He'd had a cough for several weeks and was going to and from the doctors but they thought it was a virus. 

'But when we got back from the wedding his heart rate was found to be high and he was referred to Solihull Hospital.

'He was finally diagnosed with lymphoma.'

Around 13, 900 people are diagnosed with lymphoma every year in the UK.

It can only be diagnosed by carrying out a biopsy, a minor procedure where a sample of the lymph node tissue is surgically removed and studied in a laboratory.

It is usually treated by chemotherapy or radiotherapy. 

But Mrs Jenkins said it soon became clear that chemotherapy treatment was not working for her husband.

She said: 'At first they said it was treatable and they could cure it. But whenever he had chemo it kept coming back.

Despite several rounds of chemotherapy, Mr Jenkins passed away the following April, leaving his new bride to raise their children alone.

Mr Jenkins died just nine months after getting married, despite receiving last-chance treatment in the U.S.

'He fought it for nine months and was even given a last-chance treatment from America.

'All our hopes were on that, but he was already very poorly.'

Mr Jenkins finally succumbed to the disease on April 27 last year. 

'The whole family was left heartbroken,' his widow said. 'He always made everyone laugh and would do anything for anyone - he was just that sort of person.'

To support Mr Jenkins' family, friend Adrian Court has entered an off-road obstacle race on Weston-super-Mare's beachfront on October 17.

'David was into his motorsport so I can't think of a better way to remember him,' said Adrian, from Shirley.

'I wanted to do something to help his children so all the money raised will go into a trust fund for them when they are 18.  Hopefully he'll be looking down on us and smiling.'

Mrs Jenkins added: 'I think it's a wonderful thing to do for the children and Dave would be really proud. 'I can't thank Adrian enough.'
