Crystal Palace caretaker manager Keith Millen insists Tony Pulis' departure has come out of the blue.

Pulis walked away from Palace on Thursday night following emergency talks with chairman Steve Parish about their differences over the club's transfer strategy.

Millen, who also took temporary charge last season after Ian Holloway's departure, said: 'Unfortunately this is becoming a bit of a habit, I wasn't expecting to be sitting here.

Under pressure: Millen has taken temporary charge of Crystal Palace following Tony Pulis's shock departure

'All I can say from a football point of view he was more than happy. I know he was happy on the training field - but I wasn't privy to their conversations over the last few days. I saw that their relationship was fine. 

'The transfer dealings have been frustrating as a club as we have missed out on some targets. But there's time left. 

'Tony is very single minded, while Steve has the clubs best interests at heart. But they are both strongly minded.

New boss: Former Tottenham gaffer Tim Sherwood has been tipped to replace Tony Pulis as Palace manager

Millen added: 'I got a phone call from the chairman asking me to take training and team for Saturday, but I had not spoken to Tony. 

'It has been a shock to all of us. We know the frustrations of the transfer market but we've had no inkling about it. 

'We had a meeting this morning, it was important to stress to them that they have done nothing wrong. Tony loved working with them. This obviously not ideal preparation for the Arsenal game.

The mood of the club has clearly suffered but new signing Martin Kelly saw the funny side. 

Millen reported that Kelly had said:  'I didn't think I trained that badly yesterday!'

The caretaker also confirmed that the club have discussed a move for former winger Wilfried Zaha, who is currently at Manchester United.
