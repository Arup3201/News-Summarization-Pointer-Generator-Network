The dream of a pint-sized pub big enough to fit in his back garden became reality for a homeowner when he converted his summerhouse into an opulent alehouse.

Geoff Clark, 58, designed and built The Plum Tree Arms, in East Yorkshire from scratch with the help of his youngest son, Paul.

As well becoming a focal point for the family’s social life and the envy of many landlords the petite pub is now vying for the honour of being named national shed of the year.

Labour of love: Geoff Clark, 58 converted a summer house in his back garden into an opulent alehouse

Private publican: Entry to The Plum Tree Arms is strictly by invitation only, and the Clarks are keen to retain the privacy of their private pub, which is hidden from view at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac

A keen pub regular, retired electrical inspector Mr Clark is delighted that his labour of love has been recognised.

Although entry to The Plum Tree Arms is strictly by invitation only, word has got out about his creation, with property expert Sarah Beeny and her husband Graham enjoying a couple of hours in its plush interior.

And, according to Mr Clark, 58, the celebrity pair used it as the inspiration for a similar venture at Rise Hall, the Grade II-star listed building they recently restored near Skirlaugh, East Yorks.

Social hub: Geoff Clark with his wife Rita - as well becoming a focal point for the family's social life and the envy of many landlords the petite pub is now vying for the honour of being named national shed of the year

Decoration: Mr Clark searched far and wide for the fittings and furniture, collecting pieces from friends and contacts in the trade and buying some pieces through online sales and auctions

Mr Clark, who believes he has created the 'traditional English pub', said: 'We wanted a summerhouse for my grand-daughter Ashleigh and Rita (wife) said ‘put a little bar in and we’ll have the Christening here’ and then it just snowballed.'

He searched far and wide for the fittings and furniture, collecting pieces from friends and contacts in the trade and buying some pieces through online sales and auctions, although he says he does not want to think how much the whole project has cost.

'Everywhere I go I ask for little bits. And a lot of stuff I had in my loft.

Petite pub: 'The 1910 cash register I bought on eBay and the Chesterfield chairs were off the internet. The mirror is from a pub in Rawcliffe and the bell is from the Bell Hotel in Driffield,' said Mr Clark

'The 1910 cash register I bought on eBay and the Chesterfield chairs were off the internet. The mirror is from a pub in Rawcliffe and the bell is from the Bell Hotel in Driffield,' said Mr Clark.

After the inaugural Christening, the bar has become the venue of choice for a select circle of friends and neighbours and is used for New Year’s Eve parties, fundraising events and for gatherings of Mr Clark’s former workmates.

However, the Clarks are keen to retain the privacy of their private pub, which is hidden from view at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac.

'I don’t want any Tom, Dick or Harry wandering in because it’s private and not open to the public. I said don’t tell people exactly where we are because I don’t want somebody coming down the field,' said Mrs Clark.

There are, nonetheless, a number of house rules.

No one has yet been barred - although Mrs Clark has said some have come close 'a couple of times' - and it is a no-smoking establishment.

And it is surprisingly well-stocked for its petite size, traditional cask ales are served - Mr Clark is a member of the Campaign for Real Ale - alongside a bevy of spirits, lager, cider, and at least 15 single malts.

'I think the keeping of inns is in my blood,' said Mr Clark.
