Alex Salmond begins the most crucial week yet in the battle for Scotland’s future – without the hoped-for Commonwealth Games ‘bounce’ in favour of independence.

Three days before Mr Salmond’s live TV debate with anti-independence campaign leader Alistair Darling, a poll for The Mail on Sunday revealed no boost for the ‘Yes’ campaign from the Games in Glasgow.

The Survation survey, the first of Scottish voters to be conducted since the Games began, puts the ‘Yes’ vote on 40 per cent – down one point on last month – and ‘No’ unchanged on 46 per cent. The outcome will be a bitter disappointment for Scottish Nationalists, who had hoped that scheduling the independence referendum on September 18 on the back of the Games would lead to a surge of votes to break up the UK.

It also flies in the face of reports that a feel-good factor at Glasgow’s success in staging the Games and Scotland’s record haul of medals would provide a so-called ‘Braveheart bounce’ and revitalise the ‘Yes’ campaign.

But the survey does show that Scottish First Minister Mr Salmond is a clear favourite to win Tuesday night’s debate – the first head-to-head contest between the two campaign leaders.

The charismatic Scottish Nationalist leader is backed by 37 per cent of voters to come out on top, with barely one in ten predicting that dour ex-Labour Cabinet Minister Mr Darling will triumph.

The result will heap pressure on Mr Darling, the chairman of the anti-independence Better Together campaign, who faced criticism that he is too lacklustre to take on ‘showman’ Mr Salmond.

The televised debate, before a studio audience of 300 drawn from ‘Yes’, ‘No’ and undecided voters, is seen as crucial if Mr Salmond is to overhaul a stubborn anti-independence lead in the polls.

Yesterday, it emerged that Mr Salmond has been having performance lessons from a lifestyle coach ahead of the showdown.

But in an article for The Mail on Sunday Danny Alexander, the MP for Inverness, backs Mr Darling to present the ‘clear, unvarnished’ case for staying in the UK, in contrast to the ‘verbal acrobatics’ of Mr Salmond. David Cameron has faced criticism for refusing to take on the First Minister himself in a TV debate. And the poll reveals nearly half of Scottish voters brand the Prime Minister a coward.

However, more than one in three agree that he was sensible to leave Mr Darling – as a Scot – to tackle Mr Salmond.

The Survation poll found that more than 80 per of voters say the Games have made no difference to how they were likely to vote. Only 12 per cent said they were more likely to vote ‘Yes’, with some voters (7 per cent) even saying it would actually make them more inclined to vote against independence.

A spokesman for the Yes campaign said the poll was ‘very encouraging’ and matched evidence that the result was too close to call. A spokesman for Mr Salmond said: ‘This poll makes clear that Scots believe David Cameron is afraid to take part in a debate with the First Minister.’
