Tim Sherwood wants to use the momentum of his arrival and three wins on the spin to secure Aston Villa's Premier League status 'as soon as possible'.

The new boss believes his rejuvenated side will not be in the relegation reckoning come the final weeks of the season but, after the convincing 4-0 thrashing of Sunderland on Saturday, he laughed off the suggestion he could be a Manager of the Year contender were he also to win the FA Cup.

'I wouldn't say that - if you ask me now I'll take survival above everything else,' he said after doubles from Christian Benteke and Gabrial Agbonlahor moved them two places clear of the drop zone.

The former Spurs boss leaps in the air to celebrate Villa's fourth goal in the crushing win at Sunderland

'We're confident we can stay up and we want to do it as soon as possible really. We don't want to be in those nail-biters at the end of the season.

'We could do with being safe because it isn't great for my heart-rate to be honest.

'But we're going the right way. It's all about getting a bit of momentum and I was convinced that when we won our first game the confidence would flow through the squad and we would continue.'
