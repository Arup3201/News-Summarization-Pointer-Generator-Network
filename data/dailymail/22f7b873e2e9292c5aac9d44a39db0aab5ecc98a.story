Arsene Wenger has chosen Martin Keown's confrontation with Ruud van Nistelrooy as his most memorable moment in Arsenal's rivalry with Manchester United - and admitted he doesn't know where his FA Cup-winners medals are.

Arsenal and United have had plenty of heated battles with Wenger referencing the infamous 'Battle of Old Trafford' incident as the one that stands out.

Speaking to Sportsmail columnist Keown on BBC Radio 5 Live, Wenger recalled the defender's confrontation with Van Nistelrooy following the United striker's  penalty miss in September 2003.

'The most memorable? You were involved in it,' Wenger said jokingly to Keown. 'Of course that famous incident with the penalty with Van Nistelrooy.'

As Arsenal gear up for their FA Cup sixth round tie against Manchester United next Monday, Wenger insists he is as hungry as ever for success.

Arsenal and United have enjoyed an intense rivalry in the cup down the years and are only separated by a point in the Barclays Premier League.

Ahead of Monday's clash, Wenger admitted he didn't know where his FA Cup medals from previous successes were.

'Medals, I don't even know where there are,' said Wenger. 'That tells you that I don't look back. The human side of the game is more important to me as opposed to the medals. 

'I prefer a box of memories. In this job, you have a big influence in people's lives, they have a big influence in your life as well. 

'At the top top level, these are special people - that remains longer with you than the medal, it's not the only thing that matters.

'You want to think you can have a positive influence on people lives, the club and the style of play.'

Wenger will attempt to outwit United manager Louis van Gaal, who has been criticised recently, but the Frenchman reserved special praise for the Dutchman.

'I think he's a great manager,' said Wenger. 'If you look at what he's done in his career, its incredible. He's stabilised the club. They've only lost two in 18 games. The job is more demanding now. Every game now is a trial where you judged before and after.' 

Arsenal's intense rivalry with United was defined for years by Wenger's clashes with Sir Alex Ferguson. 

'I'm much happier to see him now than before,' Wenger added. 'In the end, it became more peaceful and respectful. He was not always objective defending his time, nor was I.

'Today, we are happy to have a good dinner or good glass of wine and just talk about football.'
