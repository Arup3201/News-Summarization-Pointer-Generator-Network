Overdose: Daniel Spargo-Mabbs died after taking an ecstasy tablet

Police have ordered further tests on the body of a 16-year-old boy who died from an ecstasy overdose.

Daniel Spargo-Mabbs died in hospital on Monday after collapsing at a rave on an industrial site in Hayes, west London.

He suffered a massive heart attack at the party on Saturday night, and passed away in his mother's arms two days later in an intensive care unit.

But a post-mortem failed to establish a definitive cause of death for the sixth-former from Croydon, south London, who heartbreakingly promised his parents 'I won't die' as he left for the event.

Two people have been charged with drugs offences following the death of Daniel from Croydon in south London.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'A post-mortem examination took place on Thursday at Uxbridge Mortuary.

'No formal cause of death has been given at this stage and we await the results of further tests.

'Detectives from Hillingdon are investigating.

'Two men, aged 18 and 20, have been charged in relation to the incident. Both have been remanded in custody to appear at Isleworth Crown Court in February.

'A third man, aged 19, was arrested in connection with the incident has been bailed until a date in late March, pending further investigation.'

Daniel's mother, Fiona Spargo-Mabbs, 46, spoke of the 'peaceful' moment her son - who had dreams of joining the army - died in her arms.

She said she was grateful for the chance to say goodbye to him in person rather than him being killed on active duty.

Mrs Spargo-Mabbs said: 'He could have gone to Afghanistan and been blown to smithereens, but I got to hold him while he died,' said Mrs Spargo-Mabbs.

'It was so peaceful and we all got to say goodbye and we were all with him.'

The mother-of-two said that before Daniel's death her family had seen the negative effects of drugs through a relative who had battled addiction, and warned other parents not to be naive about their children taking illegal substances.

Fantastic boy: Mrs Spargo-Mabbs said her son was a 'good kid with a sense of adventure'

'We have seen at first hand the effect 
of addiction and the knock-on effect on the wider family, and he knew 
what that looked like,' she said.

'We told him just don’t even do it once. You just don’t know if that’s going to be you. But Daniel would have known people that would have done it and said it was amazing.'

'However good they are and however much you think you know what they might be aware of, if you’ve got a teenager they will know people who have taken drugs. And it’s frighteningly cheap, it’s pocket money.'

Daniel's parents have left his bed unmade in his bedroom at their home in Croydon, south London, which has a collage of photographs stuck to the walls and a Prom King certificate from last summer.

His father Tim opens and closes the curtains each day.

He said: 'He is never coming back. Nobody is ever going to sleep in that bed again, he will never enter this house again.

'What used to be a lively vibrant room is now still and empty and quiet. It’s just awful.'

The couple, who also have an 18-year-old son, Jacob, said they have had messages of support from all over the world including Australia, Cambodia, India and the United States, and hope to raise awareness of the dangers of drug-taking.

Nicqueel Pitrora, 18, from Croydon, and Ryan Kirk, 20, from Beckenham, both south London, appeared at Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court yesterday and are next due at Isleworth Crown Court on February 5.
