A one-of-a-kind Hermes handbag, made of matte crocodile and Togo leather and featuring built-in feet, has sold for well over double its estimate at an exclusive auction in Texas to become the world's most valuable bag.

The 'Geranium Porosus' bag is believed to have been made in 2010 as part of a Petit H Exhibition, a Hermes project in London at the time that gathered numerous rare materials and fabrics and had the world's best craftsmen create something with them.

The unique tote, which measures 32cm, would have originally retailed for about $60,000 and was expected to getch about $50,000 at the Holiday Luxury Signature Auction in Dallas over the weekend.

However, an unknown buyer put down $125,000, and shot it straight to the history books.

While most people headed for the post-Christmas sales, a group of handbag lovers headed for an exclusive auction in Dallas, Auction, with one picking up this one-of-a-king Hermes bag for $125,000. It was only expected to sell for $50,000

'All Hermès lovers have to hear is that this bag is one-of-one and they will know that it is an extraordinary piece,' Matt Rubinger, Director of Luxury Accessories at Heritage, said before the sale.

'It could be the world's most collectible bag.'

The auction was one of the largest and most important sales that the luxury accessories market has ever seen

The Dec. 10-11 designer bag event capped a three-day, $10.1+ million offering which included Heritage's $6.3 million Fine Jewelry Signature Auction.

The designer bag event featured the finest selection of brands from Hermès, Chanel, and Louis Vuitton to Celine and Judith Leiber.

Of over 900 lots, 99.4 percent were sold by value and 99.2 percent were sold by lot.

This crocodile bag managed to catch the eye of 17 bidders. It's color is said to be very difficult to achieve in the dying process. It eventually sold for $65,625

Top highlights included a Hermès 30cm Matte Paille Nilo Crocodile Birkin Bag with Palladium Hardware that sold for $65,625.

A Hermès 30cm Shiny Blue Brighton Porosus Crocodile Birkin Bag with Palladium Hardware caught the eye of 17 bidders, pushing it to $65,625 also.

Among the most anticipated lots, a Hermès 30cm Cyclamen Chevre Leather Birkin Bag with Gold Hardware hammered for $13,125, and a Chanel Stingray & Black Lambskin Leather Boy Bag with Brushed Silver Hardware more than doubled its estimate at $5,625.

Also among the bags to sell was a vibrant, one-of-a-kind Hermès Special Order Horseshoe 35cm Orange H, Vert Anis & Jaune Togo Leather Birkin Bag with Palladium Hardware, which went for $35,000.

That's what you call color blocking: This bag, featuring three vibrant colors, had a starting bid of $7000 but ended up selling for five times that amount at $35,000

It's starting bid was $7,500.

Then a Hermès Shiny Geranium Nilo Crocodile Kelly Cut Clutch Bag with Permabrass Hardware more than doubled its estimate to close at $28,750.

'One of the best parts of taking this category to a wider audience has been the incredible response of people who have loved and bought handbags for years but never self-identified as collectors,' said Rubinger.

Don't let the little ones fool you: This Hermes Shiny Geranium Nilo Crocodile Kelly Cut Clutch Bag with Permabrass Hardware was described as 'the ultimate clutch' and came with rose gold detailing. It sold for $28,750

'Now many of them are seeing that their love for handbags is justified — this is a viable, vibrant place to put investment level money right now.

'To that end, and for those collectors, we've put together a grouping of very nice bags that can possibly be gotten at more entry level prices, ranging from several hundred dollars to a few thousand, depending on where they are looking.'
