A manhunt is underway in Idaho after an inmate escaped jail Tuesday morning by climbing over the fence.

Cameras captured Nicholas Grove, 27, as he scaled the fence at the Payette County Jail's recreational yard then ran across the parking lot to freedom.

'And
 within seconds, he was able to scale over and through that razor wire 
and to the other side before the detention deputy was able to get to 
him,' Payettee County Sheriffâ€™s Office Lt. Andy Creech told KXAN.

Authorities are hunting for inmate Nicholas Grove, 27, who scaled the fence at the Payette County Jail's recreational yard then ran to freedom

Nicholas Grove is charged with unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon, carrying a concealed weapon without permit, and possession of burglary tools

A detention deputy spotted Grove from roughly 50 feet away through an open cafeteria door and chased after him, but was unable to reach him in time.

It took Grove just 15 seconds to make it over the fence, including the razor wire top, and while he cut himself while doing it it's unclear if he was hurt badly.

10 years ago an inmate attempted to escape over the fence but was injured so badly in the climb he was easily stopped.

Creech said authorities are still trying to understand how he was able to escape so easily.

'The Sheriff's Office is going to review the facility here and the recreation yard and see what we can do to from preventing this from happening again,' Creech said.

Grove reportedly cut himself while climbing the fence's razor wire but was still able to flee before guards could stop him

KBOI2 reports Grove was last seen wearing a white tee shirt and black boxers.

Grove has been incarcerated since Aug. 15.

He is 
charged with unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon, carrying a 
concealed weapon without permit, and possession of burglary tools.
