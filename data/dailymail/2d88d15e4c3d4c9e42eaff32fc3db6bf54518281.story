Allison Williams won over critics as she transformed into Peter Pan on Thursday but her live TV performance was not without the odd high-wire hitch.

The 26-year-old actress, better known for playing character Marnie in hit show Girls, had a wobbly take-off at the start of the NBC show.

Williams almost crashed into a wall in an opening scene where Peter demonstrates his magical flying powers to Wendy.

Flying high: Allison Williams takes off on Thursday during her live musical performance as Peter Pan on NBC

Williams had a near-miss with the wall while on the high-wire but quickly recovered to give a performance which won over viewers

The 26-year-old Girls star received high praise from viewers on social media for her role as the 'boy who wouldn't grow up' 

The actress recovered quickly, cushioning herself against the wall with her hand and shook off the minor mishap. 

The three-hour production of Peter Pan Live! also starred Christopher Walken as a charismatic Captain Hook - complete with tap-dancing. However the veteran actor also came under fire for apparent lip-syncing. 

One critic tweeted: 'Is Christopher Walken playing Hook, or is Capt. Hook playing a caricature of Christopher Walken?' 

But the performance appeared to be a hit with some viewers as Today anchor Savannah Guthrie quipped on Friday: 'It was not Peter Pan-ned.'

On Twitter, one viewer, @joey_aulisio, wrote: 'Allison Williams killed it. Walken killed it. That wooden gator killed it. Tiger Lily - call me. THAT DOG! Great job everyone.'

Another, @ryansatin, wrote: 'If you're not watching Walken as Hook, you are missing out on a truly special moment in TV history.' 

Williams got a boost of support before tackling the three-hour live performance from her co-star Lena Dunham, Katy Perry and her dad, news anchor Brian Williams

Celebrity fans also offered their support. Katy Perry tweeted: 'I believe in you Allison Williams!'

Zach Braff joked: 'Brian Williams is crushing this.' 

The NBC Nightly News host took the night off anchoring duties to watch his daughter's performance from the wings.

Mr Williams told TVNewser: 'We will be watching the broadcast - immediate family only - sequestered in an undisclosed location... close enough to the production as to burst through the stage door the moment the credits roll.'

However there were grumbles from viewers, as one Twitter user, @KittyKateMD, wrote: 'Although Allison Williams is singing beautiful, but her English accent is horrible! #PeterPanLive'.

Another fired back: 'Chill with the hate people. Just be thankful its not as awful as Carrie Underwood in The Sound Of Music #PeterPanLive'.

Christopher Walken delighted viewers with his drawling, sashaying Captain Hook. His tap dancing, alongside an accomplished band of pirates, drew high praise. One viewer, rather unbelievably, compared him to Fred Astaire.

But as Mia Farrow tweeted: 'Christopher Walken = Gold, no matter what.' 

The Darling children take flight under Peter Pan's instructions with the NBC telecast making much use of the high-wire during the three-hour production

Peter Pan Live! came  a year after NBC's three-hour live telecast of The Sound of Music starring Carrie Underwood revived the idea of a broadcast network mounting a full-scale musical for live TV.

That attracted nearly 19 million viewers but came in for criticism with Carrie Underwood, who played Maria, panned for her 'amateur' acting and Stephen Moyer, as Captain Georg Von Trapp, written off for 'clenched' singing.

This time, there was much more dancing, the addition of complicated flying routines, some mermaids, sword fights, digital overlays like Tinkerbell and shadows, and a live dog. Director and choreographer Rob Ashford had his work cut out for him. 

Like The Sound Of Music, Peter Pan Live! wisely leaned on Broadway performers, including five-time Tony Award-nominee Kelli O'Hara, who was sadly underused, as Mrs Darling. 

The show also starred Jake Lucas (who was in Broadway show Newsies) as John Darling and a very good Taylor Louderman (Bring It On: The Musical) as Wendy.

The beefy-armed Christian Borle, a Tony winner and veteran of last year's The Sound of Music Live!, played Mr Darling. (In a twist, Borle won his Tony playing Captain Hook in the Peter Pan play Peter and the Starcatcher.)  

Borle, who also stars in NBC’s Smash, actually played two characters - the children’s strict dad Mr Darling as well as Hook’s right-hand pirate, Smee, a character he was far more successful at playing.

But one of the stand-out performances came from the show’s second biggest star, Minnie Driver, despite only being seen onscreen for the last five minutes.

Despite being the first voice we heard as the narrator throughout, Minnie came out at the very end to play Wendy Darling after she was all grown up - a mother who was still longing for Peter Pan’s return.

Captain Hook's pirates were also big hits with viewers during the spirited three-hour special performance

Wendy's emotional moment at the end as Peter Pan finally returns - and she allows her daughter to follow him to Neverland - was one which moved many fans to tears.

It was also a more culturally sensitive Peter Pan, with Alanna Saunders, a 22-year-old woman of Cherokee descent, portraying the Native American princess character Tiger Lily, and the offensive song Ugg-a-Wugg transformed into True Blood Brothers.  

However the biggest reaction went to a rather unexpected cast member - a crazy bright purple-and-blue crocodile, who tormenting Captain Hook and his pirates throughout. 

'And the blue crocodile just broke Twitter,’ viewer Zach Brooks tweeted.

Zach Braff joked: 'Brian Williams is crushing this.'

Mia Farrow tweeted: 'Christopher Walken = Gold, no matter what.' 

Anna Kendrick went on stream of tweets as she watched. She posted: 'Dog is already the only character I care about #PeterPanLive.

'Tinkerbell sounds just like the iPhone alarm and these kids are still asleep? I don't buy it. #PeterPanLive'

'OH s***!!! Neverland is an acid trip and I never want get sober. #PeterPanLive' 

Sarah Silverman: 'There are only two women in #PeterPanLive and they're both Christopher Walken'

Sarah Michelle Gellar: 'I wonder what next years live musical will be?? I'm hoping for @MariahCarey in #HelloDolly. Anyone else have any ideas?

Aubrey Plaza: 'CHRISTOPHER WALKEN IS EVERYTHING' 

Judd Apatow: '@billyeichner: .@BillCosby u watchin Peter Pan?” He is more of a Sleeping Beauty guy. Isn't it odd to think he is sitting with someone now'
