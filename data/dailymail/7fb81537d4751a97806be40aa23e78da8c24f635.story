One of Nasa's experimental research craft has been spotted on an African runway amid claims it is being used to create high resolution 3D maps to fight terrorism.

Satellite images confirm the WB-57 aircraft was on an American military airstrip in eastern Africa a few weeks ago.

However, officials have refused to reveal what it was doing there.

The WB-57 is a mid-wing, long-range aircraft capable of operation for extended periods of time from sea level to altitudes in excess of 60,000 feet.

The WB-57 is a mid-wing, long-range aircraft capable of operation for extended periods of time from sea level to altitudes in excess of 60,000 feet. 

Two crew members are positioned at separate tandem stations in the forward section of the fuselage. 

The pilot station contains all the essential equipment for flying the aircraft while the sensor equipment operator (SEO) station contains both navigational equipment and controls for the operation of the payloads that are located throughout the aircraft. 

The WB-57 can fly for approximately 6.5 hours, has a range of approximately 2500 miles, and can carry up to 8,800 lbs of payload.

A Nasa official confirmed the sighting. 

'I really can't give you any of the details,' Jim Alexander, a Nasa official with the WB-57 High Altitude Research Program, told ABC News.

'You know, the airplane was there, you see it in the picture. But I really can't tell you what it was for.'

According to Nasa, the WB-57 Program provides 'unique, high-altitude airborne platforms to US Government agencies, academic institutions, and commercial customers in order to support scientific research and advanced technology development and testing at locations around the world.'

Mission examples include atmospheric and earth science, ground mapping, cosmic dust collection, rocket launch support, and test bed operations for future airborne or spaceborne systems. 

Digital Globe satellite imagery of the U.S. military base at Camp Lemmonier in Djibouti, dated Sept. 20, depicts NASA’s WB-57 high-altitude aircraft on the recently-expanded auxiliary operations apron.

'The question is—why? What purpose does a scientific research plane have in visiting America’s main military outpost in Africa? One possible answer is … making maps for commando raids,' said Chris Biggers, writing on Medium. 

'We know from the Next-Generation Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance Conference in Virginia in June that the HALOE sensor had already begun mapping territory for U.S. Africa Command.'

The Air Force released this image in 2011 to show the kind of maps the HALOe sensor believed to have been used on the experimental craft can create.

According to the presentation by the Army’s Geospatial Center, the sensor mapped more than 13,500 square kilometers in July and August 2013 - but does not say which aircraft. 

Biggers says the move could mean the U.S. is mapping more urban environments to create 3-D maps to help battle planners. 

'Such mapping could prove useful to American commandos fighting groups like Somalia’s Al Shabab or Boko Haram in Nigeria,' he says.

A Nasa website that tracks the agency's three WB-57s shows that one of its planes, number 926, was on a 'foreign deployment' from July to November this year.

AFRICOM, the U.S. military's Africa Command, would only say that 'aircraft from a variety of agencies and nations perform diverse missions from Camp Lemmonier in support of U.S. and allied military peace and security operations in the region, which spans East Africa and the Mideast.'

One previous mission was described by Arati Prabhakar, the head of the military's fringe-tech specialists at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, to the House subcommittee on Intelligence earlier this year as a kind of mass, three-dimensional terrain mapping.

It used a sensor called HALOE - High-Altitude LIDAR Operations Experiment.

The WB-57 can fly for approximately 6.5 hours, has a range of approximately 2500 miles, and can carry up to 8,800 lbs of payload.

The plane can be fitted with a variety of sensors that could create 3D terrain maps.

This uses light from a 'pulsed laser' to create 'precise, three-dimensional information about the shape of the Earth and its surface characteristics,' according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

'HALOE provided forces in Afghanistan with unprecedented access to high-resolution 3D data, and it collected orders of magnitude faster and from much longer ranges than conventional methods,' Prabhakar said, according to written testimony. 

Given 90 days, Prabhakar said she was confident the system could've mapped half the country.

'At full operational capacity, HALOE could enable mapping of 50 percent of Afghanistan in 90 days.

'State-of-the-art deployed systems would have required 3 years to accomplish that task, and more conventional systems would have required 30 years.'

The HALOE sensor pod was initially integrated onto a WB-57 aircraft and deployed to Afghanistan from November 2010 through August 2011 in a joint effort with the Army Geospatial Center (AGC).'

'During this time, over 70,000 square kilometers of terrain data (about 10 percent of Afghanistan) were collected, reflecting the priorities of operational units,' Prabhakar said

According to Nasa, all three WB-57s are now back in the U.S., with their status listed as 'inactive.'
