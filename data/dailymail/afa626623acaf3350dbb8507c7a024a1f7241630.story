There will be plenty of smiling faces around this weekend as the temperatures finally soar and the sun starts to blaze.

But if you want to find the biggest grin of all, head to Scotland and look up a 60-year-old married teacher called Steve.

You can’t miss him. He lives in Edinburgh, has grey hair, blue eyes and wears glasses.

According to a study, he’s the happiest person in Britain.

The happiest hypothetical man in Britain: Anyone called Steve who is over 60, married, lives in the Edinburgh area and teaches, can pride themselves on ticking all the boxes to be named the cheeriest person in the UK

Researchers came up with the composite after questioning 2,000 people  across the nation about their levels of happiness.

Your
name, appearance, age, marital status and where you live all affect 
your mood, according to research carried out by Cadbury Heroes.

The survey of 20,000 people showed that people in the UK grew more positive as they aged and, on average, women aren't as happy as men.

Researchers said: 'Those in their mature years of 60s and 70s were happiest of all compared to their 20 year old counterparts.'

Names can affect your happiness

'We also found men to be 
happier than women, while singletons - who may be footloose and fancy 
free - were not as happy as those who were married.'

The cheeriest places in the UK were named as Southampton, Cardiff and Edinburgh.

Whereas people living in Liverpool, Newcastle and Norwich were found to be more downcast.

Unsurprisingly, people who see their friends and family regularly were more cheerful than those who don't.

Our names are believed to be a big factor in levels of happiness. People called Norman or Wendy have been blessed with a sunny disposition.

Whereas, men named Gary or Chris and women called Tina or Rebecca are more prone to unhappy spells.

Even your appearance has an impact on how you feel, according to the research. The lighter someone's hair, the happier they are.

Blue-eyed people are the most content and people who wear glasses are cheerier than those who don't.
