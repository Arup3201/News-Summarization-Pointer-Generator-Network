A rare glimpse into the family album of pop superstar Cher has revealed where the singer gets her youthful appearance from - her 86-year-old mother.

Georgia Holt, who once harboured her own ambitions of being an actress and a singer, talks candidly about the difficulties she faced as a young mother in new documentary 'Dear Mom, Love Cher'.

She told how, while pregnant with Cher, she almost had an abortion because of pressure from her own mother.

Georgia said when she fell pregnant with Cher she had just left her first husband.

She said her mother, who had given birth to Georgia when she was only 13, said she either have an abortion or return to her husband. She could not bring the child up as a single mother.

Georgia also admitted she had to temporarily put Cher into an orphanage because she couldn't afford to look after her, a decision she has always regretted.

Talking of the day she gave birth to Cher. Georgia said: 'I can remember the chairs were chrome [in the clinic], and I was sweating. The sweat was just coming off of me on this chrome and when the door opened and it was my turn, I said, 'Mother, I can't do it.' So, that's how she's here.'

Cher, now 66, told the USA Today newspaper: 'I heard the abortion story when I was a teenager. The orphanage story has been a touchy one for my mom her whole life, and she didn't want to talk about it. I said, 'Mom, why didn't you just march in and take me?'

'She said, 'I didn't have the power. I didn't have any money or a job, and the church was so strong. I'd go see you every day and you'd be crying. You don't know what it was like.' It was harder for women then.

'I thought, this could be tricky, But what's anyone going to do to me now? So I come from a poor white trash background. It doesn't make any difference.'

Cher, Georgia and Georganne recently appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres show to promote the 86-year-old's first album, Honky Tonk Woman.

The mother-daughter duo started off the show with a performance of a track called I'm Just Your Yesterday, which was originally recorded in the 1980s, but was recently rediscovered by the 66-year-old as she helped her mother with some spring cleaning.

The slow-tempo was well received but had a shaky start - but if anyone can deal with a professional mishap with an abundance of Love and Understanding, it's Cher.

Ellen filled the audience in, explaining: 'This album was done 31 years ago, and lost in the garage.

'You pulled it together and I think you are going to sing a littleÂ  bit of a song from it now.'

The story behind Honky Tonk Woman is an interesting one.

More than 30 years ago, Georgia recorded a country-influenced album with the members of Elvis Presley's band.

The tapes from these recording sessions were forgotten in her garage until Cher stumbled across them a few years ago.

She helped her to preserve them, but soon the mother daughter duo decided it might be good fun to record them performing a couple of the tracks, just for themselves.

These performances formed the basis of the documentary 'Dear Mom, Love Cher' 
which will look at Georgia's extraordinary life.

The documentary took a detailed look at Georgia's colourful life for the first time.

As well as jamming with Elvis' band, Georgia has been married six times - twice to Cher's father John Sarkisian.

Born in Arkansas, she enjoyed stints modelling and acting, and is a skilled musician.

She has Native American ancestry, which inspired Cher's hit record, Half Breed.
