The first Diet Coke Break advert aired in 1994, starring a hunky construction worker who kept a group of admiring women in an office glued to their window every day at 11.30am when he paused for a can of Diet Coke.

The innovative campaign became a cultural phenomenon and flipped traditional gender roles on their head. The series continue and evolved with fresh incarnations in 1997 and 2007.

Now, to celebrate the diet drink's 30th birthday, Diet Coke is bringing back The Hunk - and he is sexier than ever.

The full video comes out Monday, but watch the teaser here...

Diet Coke will also bring back Robert Merrill, the handsome star of theÂ 1998 ad, for the 30th birthday ad.

Merrill, who now stars in 90210, CSI and Californication, says: 'I still do have a love affair with Diet Coke. She's been good to me for all these years.'

'Women got excited when they saw the Diet
Coke Hunk commercials.'

'Being objectified by women is a pretty 
good feeling if you ask me, and I felt like a rock star. Life is short 
and the commercial was harmless.'

The full new Hunk video is released on Monday via Diet Coke's YouTube channel, where they claim they have an even bigger announcement, too.

Diet Coke launched in 1982.

Twelve years later they released the original 'Diet Coke Break Hunk' advert featuring American model and actor Lucky Vanous.

The 1994 ad sees Lucky as a handsome 
construction worker on a building site, keeping a group of admiring 
women in an office building glued to their window.

In 1998 the second Diet Coke Break 
Hunk advert featured Robert Merrill keeping ladies on time for their 
11.30am appointment as an unforgettable window washer.

In 2007 Diet Coke decided to let their Hunk keep his top on.

Played by 28-year-old French skater and Economics graduate Francois Xavier, the lift engineer comes to rescue three ladies after they get (intentionally) stuck in an office lift.
