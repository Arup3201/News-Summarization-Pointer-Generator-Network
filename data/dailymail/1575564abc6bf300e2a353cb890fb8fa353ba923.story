Fashion-forward pet owners can now help their pampered pooch follow suit thanks to the custom made ‘paw bag'.

Created as an exact replica of their owner's favourite handbag, the miniature totes for dogs claim to be the ultimate accessory for style-savvy pets.

The concept comes from a luxury accessories retailer and luxury launches website, allowing dogs to carry their possessions around in true designer style.

Fashionista dog owners can now accessorise with their pampered pooch thanks to the 'paw bag'

Owners can choose any handbag from Forzieri.com or selected partner brand to be made into miniature for a beloved pooch - creating an adorable matching set.

The pawbag is then attached safely to the dog's collar - coordinating with that attached to their owner's arm.

Andrea Forzieri, CEO & founder of Forzieri.com said: 'An increasing amount of fashion-conscious women are owning dogs.

'We felt that they would delight in enabling their pooches to match their own elegant style.'

The concept comes form luxury accessories retailer Forzieri.com and luxury launches website, VeryFirst.com

Prices for the bags, available on luxury launches website VeryFirstTo.com, range from between £301 to £3,042, with a minimum turnaround of two weeks.

The designs were created with help from VeryFirstTo.com, who conducted a survey to find the world's most fashionable dog.

Topping the results was the labrador - followed closely by the Golden Retriever and Dalmation.The least fashionable dog was the Scottish breed, the Dandie Dinmont Terrier.

Marcel 
Knobil, founder of VeryFirstTo, said: 'This wonderful fashion-forward 
‘pawbag' will make even the least fashionable dog feel worthy of the 
"dogwalk".

'We anticipate that Forzieri has created a trend that will sweep across the globe.'
