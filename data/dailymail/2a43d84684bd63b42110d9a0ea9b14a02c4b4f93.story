When FIFA’s corruption buster Michael Garcia denounced the report on his own findings, football’s world governing body must have known they were in trouble. And when the day ended with the news that the FBI were re-doubling their efforts to investigate FIFA, it would be fair to say that Thursday’s much-heralded publication of the report into the 2018/2022 bidding process had not gone as FIFA president Sepp Blatter had anticipated.

What was so wrong about the report?

The 42-page summary of an exhaustive year-long investigation alludes to several instances of potential corruption, before concluding on every single bid that they did not ‘compromise the integrity of the 2018/2022 bidding process’. It also gives FIFA a clean bill of health.

Yet even this report cites several occasions when that appears not to be the case. The Qatar bid sponsored the African Confederation’s (CAF) conference for £1.15million. ‘No bidding rule prohibited sponsorship agreements like the one between Qatar 2022 and CAF.’ Which implies the same rules, which have been pronounced ‘fair and thorough’, were hugely deficient.

Is it right to clear Qatar?

It is impossible to tell. Even Garcia’s fuller investigation was limited in the scope of its inquiry to the point of being almost redundant. Most FIFA watchers have always said that Qatar’s Aspire Academy, which hands out grants to developing nations around the world, was the key to currying favour with FIFA executive committee members. And yet the Aspire Academy merits just one short paragraph.

Qatar were named as the host nation for the 2022 World Cup back in 2010

Were there other examples of potential corruption?

Argentina and Brazil played a friendly in Qatar in November 2010, two weeks before the vote, and ‘an entity wholly owned by a Qatari business conglomerate financed the event. According to (Qatar) bid officials, the entity was unaffiliated with Qatar 2022 . . . Nevertheless . . . the financing of the event . . . raises concerns . . . in particular in relation to certain arrangements concerning payments for the Argentina Football Association.’

The Argentina federation president at the time was the late Julio Grondona, who had a vote on 2022 and who was hugely influential as a senior FIFA vice-president.

So, did every bidding team cooperate?

No. Garcia was subjected to a travel ban by the Russian government, which meant he couldn’t visit the country from April 2013. And the Russians could provide only ‘limited’ documents to the inquiry as the computers they used were ‘leased’ and their owner claims he had destroyed them.

What about the FA?

The report makes excruciating reading with regard to the FA’s treatment of CONCACAF president Jack Warner. England ‘often accommodated Mr Warner in apparent violation of bidding rules’ and ‘appeared willing to provide benefits and favours’ to Warner’s own football team, Joe Public FC, and ‘even sought to find employment in the UK for a person of interest to Warner’.

FA chairman Greg Dyke called the probe ‘a joke, a shambles and a complete farce from start to finish’

England were criticised for trying to woo former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner

Will we ever discover what really went on?

Probably not. Even this summary hints that Garcia’s inquiry has been frustrated by the limited powers and scope of his investigation. It points out frequently that he could not compel witnesses to testify unless they were football officials. A persistent theme is that any dirty work is outsourced to individuals, consultants or companies who are not subject to FIFA regulations. ‘To assume that envelopes full of cash are given in exchange for votes on a FIFA World Cup host is naive. Corruption . . . is executed in much more sophisticated ways.’

This document seems to indicate that, if the report were published in full, there are several football officials who could be charged and perhaps suspended by FIFA’s ethics commission. But you can be sure that FIFA will never uncover the whole truth. We can only hope the FBI fare better.
