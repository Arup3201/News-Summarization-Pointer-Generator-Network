Her figure is the envy of women around the world thanks to her slim yet curvaceous shape. 

And now fans of Beyonce can emulate the very diet that got her there, by going vegan with the star's new food delivery service. 

The 33-year-old has partnered with her personal trainer Marco Borges to create an on-demand service called 22 Days Nutrition.

Singer Beyonce has launched a  on-demand vegan delivery service with her trainer Marco Borges that lasts for 22 days

The idea behind the 22 day plan is that it takes 21 days to break your unhealthy eating habits. 

All of the meals in the plan will be 100 per cent plant-based and delivered once a week, with all ingredients non-GMO, gluten-free, soy-free, dairy-free and organic.

The prices start as low as $9.24 (£6.15) per meal and you can choose to have one, two or three meals delivered per day.

Sample dishes include  curry fried rice with vegetables, almond berry breakfast loaf and fajita breakfast beans.

Beyonce said of the plan: 'All you have to do is try. If I can do it, anyone can.'

22 Days nutrition is delivered directly to your door and meals start for as little as $9.24 per dish

Her business partner Borges added: 'We all know the importance and value of eating plant-based foods but often times find ourselves trapped in a series of bad habits that sabotage optimum wellness.

'The Vegan Meal Delivery program makes it easier to reset your habits with healthy and delicious plant-based foods.' 

Beyonce first decided to try veganism herself at the end of 2013, when she and her husband Jay Z dramatically slimmed down after following the healthy eating plan.

Jay posted about the plan on his Life and Times website saying: 'On December 3, one day before my 44th birthday, I will embark on a 22 Days challenge to go completely vegan, or as I prefer to call it, plant-based! 

When Beyonce went vegan at the end of 2013, she took great delight in sharing photos of the delicious food that she had been eating

He continued: 'This all began a few months back when a good friend and vegan challenged me to embrace a  'plant-based breakfast' every day. 

'It was surprisingly easier on me than I thought ... PS: B is also joining me.'

Beyonce then posted a series of Instagram pictures detailing some of their meals, which included vegan macaroni cheese.

They were also spotted eating out at Vegan restaurant called Crossroads in Los Angeles. 

Singer Jennifer Lopez is also a fan of the plan and has previously said: 'You do feel better. I do recommend the vegan diet because you wake up and feel great!'. 

It has previously been reported that vegans are, on average, 10 to 20 pounds lighter than their meat-eating counterparts. 

Now fans of the singer can emulate the diet that she undertook by signing up the the 22 Days Nutrition plan

FEMAIL spoke to Lifesum nutritionist Lovisa Nilsson, who said that a vegan diet can be good for your health. 

She said: 'A vegan diet has several health benefits, including lowering blood pressure and cholesterol, which reduces the risk of heart disease, cancer and type 2 diabetes. 

'Plant-based foods are a good source of protein, whilst whole grains, vegetables and legumes are low in fat (especially saturated fat), high in dietary fibre and contain no cholesterol.

'Aside from the abundance of health benefits, a vegan diet is also addressing environmental and ethical concerns which makes the vegan lifestyle even more appealing.'

Beyonce and Jay both went on the diet with Jay Z saying that he found it easier than he had expected to 

Lovisa cautions that anyone deciding to try out veganism needs to make sure they keep their diet balanced though. 

She said: 'Eliminating animal products makes it more difficult to keep a well-balanced diet, and vegans often lack essential nutrients, such as vitamins B-12 and D, calcium and omega-3 fatty acids.

'Although many plant-based foods contain protein, such as beans and tofu, it is often not enough; deficiency and iron anaemia is another issue when replacing meat with other products. 

'A vegan diet lacks vitamin B-12, which is essential for the function of every cell in our bodies. B-12 can only be found in certain types of algae.

'Embarking on a vegan meal plan is a big change for the body, and as with any diet, education and planning are vital in order to ensure you get a balanced diet of vitamins and nutrition. 

'I would also suggest consulting a nutritionist or a doctor to make sure you are suited for this diet and that it is nutritionally wholesome. 

'And keep in mind that becoming vegan doesn't automatically make you healthier, and perhaps it is not necessary to make a full-fledged lifestyle change.'
