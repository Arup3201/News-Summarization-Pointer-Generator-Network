A Girl Scout is in high demand after she started selling cookies outside a medical marijuana clinic.

Thirteen-year-old Danielle Lei was certainly ‘thinking outside the box’ when she set up her cookie stall outside The Green Cross marijuana dispensary in San Francisco.

Entrepreneurial Miss Lei sold 117 boxes of Tagalongs and Thin Mints in two hours, the proceeds of which benefits charitable organisations.

Miss Lei’s mother Carol said her daughter sold dozens more boxes outside The Green Cross than at other locations – and sold out of Dulce de Leches.

Both Danielle and her older sister Nikki have been selling cookies outside medical marijuana clinics before, and their parents see it as a way to learn about the difference between using the drug as a medicine compared to recreation, Mrs Lei told Mashable.

‘You put it in terms that they may understand,’ she said. ‘I'm not condoning it, I'm not saying go out in the streets and take marijuana.’

The Green Cross was more than supportive of Miss Lei’s initiative, and staff bought several boxes for themselves, Mashable reported.

Miss Lei’s business idea was equally approved by Girl Scouts of Northern California, who said it is down to the parents where children sell the cookies.

‘The mom decided this was a place she was comfortable with her daughter being at,’ Dana Allen, director of marketing and communications for Girl Scouts of Northern California, told Mashable.  

‘We're not telling people where they can and can't go if it's a legitimate business.’

Not all Girl Scout organisations are as open as California, despite recreational marijuana being legal in both Washington and Colorado.

Girls Scouts of Colorado recently denounced a photo of three girls selling cookies outside a marijuana clinic as a photoshop hoax.

‘If you are wondering, we don't allow our Girl Scouts to sell cookies in front of marijuana shops or liquor stores/bars,’ Girls Scouts of Colorado tweeted.

In contrast, The Green Cross has invited Miss Lei and her mother to come back, and the charity sales will continue tomorrow, Saturday 22nd February, Mashable reported.
