James, who decided to leave the Miami Heat at the end of last season, will not be back in competitive NBA action until the end of October.

Cleveland Cavaliers will be hoping James comes back firing on all cylinders after they missed out on a spot in last season's NBA play-offs.

James helped the Miami Heat seal a place in the play-off finals but was unable to get his hands on a third NBA Championship.
