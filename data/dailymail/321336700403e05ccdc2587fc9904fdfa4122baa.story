As the residents of Woodland Heights in Houston, Texas are sleeping, one man is pooing in his neighbors lawns until the wee hours of the morning.

The Houston Police Department believes that the unknown man is leaving his mark sometime between 1:00 and 4:00 am but police still don't have a confirmed motive for the dirty crimes.

'We’ve had reports from six to eight neighbors out there that someone is actually coming into their yard and defecating — generally on their driveways,' said Sgt. J.C. Mosier to CBS.

The community of Woodland Heights in Houston, Texas has been terrorized by a mystery 'serial pooper' leaving his mark in their backyards at night

'I think the neighbors are laughing about it, but that’s because it’s only happened to two houses in the neighborhood. If it starts happening more, I think people might become enraged,' says Amy, a resident from the Heights.

How much poop can one man make though?,' she continues.

Amy told reporters that one person's yard was pooped in over six times.

Sgt. Mosier along with other members of the county believe that the 'serial defacator' may be trying to seek revenge on his neighbors.

'I’m thinking revenge poop is definitely a possibility. We’re all wondering, what did this person who’s having the creep-crapper hit their house repeatedly do?, said Mosier.

Mosier says that years ago, a man pooped in other people's yards because he was angry when people let their dogs go to the bathroom on his lawn.

'It turned out to be a neighbor who was mad at people for letting their dogs come in his yard and not cleaning up after them,' said Mosier of the crime from many years ago. He decided to get his own revenge.'

Even though some may find the actions amusing, others are taking the serial pooper very seriously and are doing all that they can to catch him. You have to worry about anybody that would go this extreme to do something, no matter what the reason. You don’t know what a person like that is capable of,' said Mosier.

No one has been arrested as of yet but surveillance footage shows the suspect to be an aging Hispanic man.

A similar incident happened years ago when a neighbor was mad about dogs pooing in his lawn and so he defecated out of revenge
