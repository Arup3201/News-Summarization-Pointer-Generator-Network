Much-loved children's character Peppa Pig has come under fire from irate parents after telling kids to 'go to hell' on her Facebook page.

Visitors to the Peppa Pig World Facebook site have been met with abusive messages over the last three days after the account was hacked.

Several spam links and pictures were uploaded onto the social networking page, which more than 130,000 people have 'liked,' leading to scores of complaints from parents that their children could see the posts.

A series of text messages from an iPhone were uploaded to the page - of which one read read 'go to hell b****'.

The comments have stacked up on the Facebook page to highlight the unsuitability of the posts on a page for children

Angry
parents complained to the park about the 'inappropriate' and 
'disgusting' posts on the web page and demanded free tickets to the 
attractions.

Julie Loader said: 'What mentality 
must the hacker have to think its clever to hack a page for a children's
theme park?? Needs sorting by the real PPW page admin!'

While
Sue Cartwright-Smith said: 'This is disgusting, who ever posted the pic
shud b ashamed of themselves. This is a family friends group page &
I wouldn't appreciate my daughter reading this,' (sic).

The hackers took control of the page on Monday and posted several messages. One
commenter even went as far to say that rival television character Dora 
the Explorer may have been responsible for the hacking.

The page has since been taken down from Facebook.

Others questioned whether young 
children should be using the social media website as Facebook's policy 
is that children under 13 should not have a profile.

The Hampshire-based attraction, which
is part of Paultons Family Theme Park, posted an apology on their own 
page and said they were trying to take hold of the situation.

The comments appeared on the official Facebook page for Peppa Pig World in Hampshire

The statement said: 'Unfortunately the Peppa Pig World Facebook page has been compromised. We are looking into the situation asap, please accept our apologies for any inconvenience caused.'

The television show is shown in more than 180 countries around the world won a children's Bafta in 2005 for best pre-school animation.

The park includes seven Peppa Pig themed rides including the 'Windy Castle' and 'Grandpa Pig's Boat Trip.'

The Peppa Pig cartoon series is hugely popular all over the world, and is currently shown in 180 countries

It's not the first time the kids favourite has faced uproar. The character was due to appear at a children's centre in South London as part of the Labour Party's manifesto launch for families in 2010 but withdrew to avoid any controversy.

Seat belts were also added to the show after complaints that the animals were not wearing them while in cars.
