The White House has insisted that the creation of its 'Cuban Twitter' programme was not a covert operation.

The Obama administration defended the communications network called Zunzuneo, which drew 40,000 users in Cuba in two years, saying the programme was 'invested and debated' in Congress.

But two senior Democrats on congressional and judiciary committees said they knew nothing about the effort, with one of them describing it as 'dumb, dumb, dumb.'

More than 40,000 Cubans were using Zunzuneo but the White House say it was not a covert operation

It was reported that the social network, partly funded by the US Agency for International Aid (USAID), aimed to build a Cuban audience of mostly young people and sought to evade Cuba's stranglehold on the internet with a primitive social media platform.

But the users were neither aware it was created by an US agency with ties to the State Department, nor that American contractors were gathering personal data about them for political purposes.

Chairman of the Senate Appropriations State Department and Foreign Operations subcommittee, Senator Partick Leahy said he had no knowledge of the social media network.

And he called the project 'dumb, dumb, dumb' during an appearance on MSNBC yesterday.

He added: 'I know they said we were. We were notified in the most oblique way that nobody could understand it.

'I'm going to ask two basic questions: Why weren't we specifically told about this if you're asking us for money? And secondly, whose bright idea was this anyway?'

Congressman Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said he too was unaware of Zunzuneo.

It is unclear whether the Zunzuneo scheme was legal under U.S. law, which requires written authorization of covert action by the president as well as congressional notification. 

Zunzuneo was partly funded by the US Agency for International Aid and was said to be aimed at young Cubans

White House spokesman Jay Carney said he was not aware of individuals in the White House who had known about the programme.

But hours later the narrative had shifted to say that the administration had offered to discuss funding for it with the congressional committees that approve federal programs and budgets.

State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf described the Zunzuneo scheme as 'discreet' but in no way classified or covert.

She added that the project did not rise to the level that required the either the current or former secretary of state, to be informed. 

In his prior position as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary of State John Kerry had asked congressional investigators to examine whether or not U.S. democracy promotion programs in Cuba were operated according to U.S. laws, among other issues.

Zunzuneo, which is slang for a Cuban hummingbird's tweet was launched in the country in 2009

The resulting report, released by the Government Accountability Office in January 2013, does not examine whether or not the programs were covert. It does not say that any U.S. laws were broken.

The GAO report does not specifically refer to Zunzuneo, but does note that USAID programs included 'support for the development of independent social networking platforms.'

But the Republican chairman of a House oversight subcommittee said his panel will be looking into the project too.

'That is not what USAID should be doing," said Congressman Jason Chaffetz.

'USAID is flying the American flag and should be recognized around the globe as an honest broker of doing good. If they start participating in covert, subversive activities, the credibility of the United States is diminished.'

In a statement, Josefina Vidal, director of U.S. affairs at Cuba's Foreign Ministry, also criticised the latest revelations.

He said 'This shows once again that the United States government has not renounced its plans of subversion against Cuba, which have as their aim the creation of situations of destabilization in our country to create changes in the public order and toward which it continues to devote multimillion-dollar budgets each year.

'The government of the United States must respect international law and the goals and principles of the United Nations charter and, therefore, cease its illegal and clandestine actions against Cuba, which are rejected by the Cuban people and international public opinion.'

But several other lawmakers voiced their support for Zunzuneo, which is slang for a Cuban hummingbird's tweet.

But chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said USAID should be applauded for giving people in Cuba a less-controlled platform to talk to each other

Senator Bob Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said USAID should be applauded for giving people in Cuba a less-controlled platform to talk to each other.

Mr Menendez added: 'The whole purpose of our democracy programs, whether it be in Cuba or other parts of the world, is in part to create a free flow of information in closed societies.'

USAID and its contractors went to extensive lengths to conceal Washington's ties to the project, according to interviews and documents obtained by the AP.

They set up front companies in Spain and the Cayman Islands to hide the money trail, and recruited CEOs without telling them they would be working on a U.S. taxpayer-funded project.

The estimated $1.6 million spent on ZunZuneo was publicly earmarked for an unspecified project in Pakistan, public government data show, but those documents don't reveal where the funds were actually spent, according to AP.

Zunzuneo was launched in 2009, shortly after the arrest of Alan Gross, left. Cuban Ernesto Guerra, right described the abrupt end of the network as 'like a vacuum.'

Zunzuneo was publicly launched shortly after the 2009 arrest in Cuba of American contractor Alan Gross.

He was imprisoned after travelling repeatedly to the country on a separate, clandestine USAID mission to expand Internet access using sensitive technology that only governments use.

USAID told the AP that ZunZuneo stopped in September 2012 when a government grant ended.

'The moment when ZunZuneo disappeared, (it) was like a vacuum," said Ernesto Guerra, a Cuban user who never suspected his beloved network had ties to Washington.

'In the end, we never learned what happened. We never learned where it came from.'
