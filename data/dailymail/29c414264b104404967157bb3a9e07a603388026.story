Senate Republicans blocked the confirmation of former Senator Chuck Hagel to be Secretary of Defense, making it the first time that such a nominee has been temporarily barred from their intended post.

Though Hagel was approved on Tuesday as a suitable nominee by the Senate Armed Services Committee, GOP Senators voted against his nomination.

In order to be approved as Secretary of Defense- to take over from outgoing Secretary Leon Panetta- he needed to get 60 votes in the Democrat-heavy caucus. He only garnered 58, with 40 votes against.

Conservatives cite their longstanding objections to their former colleague's policy views on Israel and Iran in their debates, but really they blame the Obama administration's reticence to reveal more information about the attacks on the American consulate in Libya in which four were killed, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens.

Weary: Though he is a Republican, Chuck Hagel took a beating in Senate Armed Services Committee hearings for his views that the U.S. should engage in direct talks with Iran and Israel

'There are still questions outstanding,' Senator John McCain said on the floor Thursday.

McCain was one of the Republicans, along with Senator Lindsey Graham, who led the charge against Hagel's approval.

Hagel, a former two term Republican Senator, was nominated by President Obama on January 7 to replace Panetta.

Though once a member of their ranks, Republicans in the Senate have fiercely criticized the Nebraska native for his views that the U.S. should engage in direct talks with Iran and Hamas.

Now his vote is being held up using the organizational wrangling of a filibuster, though the changes will not hold. 

In a purely logistical move, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid voted against Hagel so that he is able to bring  up the vote on his confirmation at a later date.

Happy with the result: Republican Senators John McCain and Kelly Ayotte did not want Hagel to be approved and they were some of the most critical questioners during his confirmation hearing

Nay: Senate Republicans Lindsey Graham (S.C.), left, and Jim Inhofe (Okla.), right, have threatened to delay the full Senate confirmation vote on Hagel, scheduled for Friday

'Chuck Hagel had nothing to do with 
the attack on Bengahzi. There are serious consequences to this delay,' 
Reid said in response on Thursday.

With the vote where it was, Hagel 
would have been passed a majority measure, but he needed 60 votes in 
order to comply with the regulations. When his appointment is brought up
again- which will likely take place next week- he will only need a 
majority in order to be approved.

He was also forced to apologize for 
his statement in a 2006 interview in which he said, 'The Jewish lobby 
intimidates a lot of people up here…. I’m not an Israeli senator. I’m a 
United States senator.'

Additionally,
Republicans have expressed deep concerns about Hagel's earnings once he
retired from the Senate in 2008 and moved into the private sector. They
have asked for details of his compensation as a consultant and his time
on the lecture circuit, to prove that he didn't take money from 
countries hostile to America.

Tough crowd: The Senate confirmation hearing to review Obama's nomination of Chuck Hagel kicked off on Jan. 31 and was met with opposition from Republicans

The Senate Armed Services
Committee hearings on Hagel's nomination kicked off on January 31, 
starting an ugly, partisan back and forth.

Despite opposition from conservatives, the committee approved Hagel as their nominee on February 12.

Now the decision goes to the Senate floor for a vote.

Senator
Reid filed a motion on Wednesday to limit debate and force a vote by 
the end of the week but Republicans are saying, 'Not so fast.'

Though
Republicans are in the minority in the upper chamber, 45 to 55 
Democratic members, they are aggressively working to form a 60-vote 
margin that would filibuster the vote.

Though this maneuver is a filibuster by definition, Republicans are avoiding the label.

'We're going to require a 60-vote threshold,' Republican Senator Jim Inhofe, the ranking
member of the Armed Services Committee, told Foreign Policy blog, The Cable.

'It's not a filibuster. I don't want to use that word,' he said. 

Plotting ahead: Democratic Senate Majority leader Harry Reid voted against Hagel purely for logistics so that he is allowed to call another vote for the prospective nominee later on, which will likely take place next week

Inhofe also told the National Review this 
week that he would work to foil Mr Obama's plans.

'It's going to be a long, long time before he hits the floor,' he said about trying to delay a Senate vote on Hagel.

'The
anti-Israel history of Chuck Hagel is real. We can’t have someone at 
the Pentagon who has made these kind of statements,' Inhofe added. 

Several others in the party are also said to have joined Inhofe's cause.

Republican Senator Graham from South Carolina- who is also a member of the Senate Armed Services 
Committee- said earlier this month that Mr Obama should reconsider 
Hagel's nomination.

Graham is among the Republicans who voted against ending
debate on Hagel's nomination.

He
has joined with fellow committee members McCain and
Senator Kelly Ayotte to call on Mr Obama to clarify his administration's precise actions in the hours leading up to the September 11 attack on 
the U.S. Mission in Benghazi.

Outta here: Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, on Feb. 13, left the CIA to head up the DOD in July 2011

'The debate on Chuck Hagel is not over,' Graham said.

'It
has not been serious. We don't have the information we need. And I'm 
going to fight the idea of jamming somebody through until we get answers
about what the president did personally when it came to the Benghazi 
debacle.'

This
week McCain slammed Hagel for his 'disappointing' performance answering questions, adding 'his 
often adversarial attitude toward legitimate questions from Committee 
members was troubling.'

Committee
chair Democratic Senator Carl Levin has expressed his confidence in the 
Obama administration's desire to be forthcoming on the Benghazi attack. 

Other
Democrats have praised Hagel for his military service during the 
Vietnam War, for which he earned two purple hearts, and his Congressional career.
