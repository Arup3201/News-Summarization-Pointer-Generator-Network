A Tory-led group of councillors has voted against a proposal to build a statue of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in her home town.

The idea to immortalise the Iron Lady in Grantham, Lincolnshire, was backed by Labour councillors, but a full South Kesteven District Council meeting has overwhelmingly voted against the proposal for a statue in the town.

The market town only has a small plaque adorning the wall of the store where Baroness Thatcher grew up to honour their most-famous export.

Lady Thatcher stands next to the £150,000 white marble statue of her in 2002. Shortly after, it was famously decapitated by a protester. Councillors in Grantham have voted against a proposal to create another statue 

The meeting on Friday saw councillors vote 40 against - with only seven members in favour of the idea.

Speaking
at the meeting, Labour leader Charmaine Morgan said: 'Last year 
£11billion was spent by tourists in our region. Many of those tourists 
came up from London.

'We 
must take more advantage, through marketing, of our links to London, and
we need a package of deliverables to attract tourists in addition to 
our existing offering.

'Our Crafts Centre and Lady Thatcher statue would be a start.

'In
the interest of our community the Labour Group is therefore proposing 
that we act together as council to put an end to the uncertainty about 
how we will celebrate this remarkable character as a daughter of 
Grantham.

'We ask that all
parties join us and support our proposal to have a competition which 
will enable the participation of local educational establishments and 
artists to produce a suitable statue alongside an exhibit which explores
Lady Thatcher's life and examines what made her such a controversial 
and internationally recognised figure - even today.'

Last
month, the manager of Grantham museum Jayne Robb was suspended after 
making the 'erroneous' claim that a £150,000 white marble statue of 
Baroness Thatcher had been offered to the Lincolnshire town.

The
work was famously decapitated by a protester in 2002 but has since been
restored, being kept behind a glass case at a cost of £3,000 before 
being put in storage at the House of Commons.

Thatcher,
a greengrocer's daughter, who went on to be prime minister from 1979 
until 1990, was born in Grantham and went to Kesteven and Grantham 
Girls' School.

She was the longest serving prime minister for more than 150 years.

South
Kesteven District Council is one of the biggest districts in the 
country, covering 365 square miles of English countryside.

The
58 seats are currently held by 38 Conservatives, 12 Independents with 
one Liberal Democrat aligned to the independent group, and seven Labour 
members.
