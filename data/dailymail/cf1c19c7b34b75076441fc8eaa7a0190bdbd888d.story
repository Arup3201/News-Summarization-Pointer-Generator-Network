England fans travelling to next summer's World Cup in Brazil have been warned to protect themselves against a terrifying holiday bug which can kill.

Organisers FIFA and their sponsors are being urged to spell out the risks of mosquito-borne dengue fever after a study showed cases could peak in three of the twelve host cities.

It usually produces flu-like symptoms but severe forms cause internal bleeding - claiming 20,000 lives every year.

Dengue is endemic in over 100 countries with 100 million people struck down annually.

Professor Simon Hay, an infectious diseases expert, has called on the Brazilian authorities to take action to reduce the number of mosquitoes before over half a million people flock in from across the globe.

He said: 'Dengue fever could be a significant problem in some of the tournament locations and preventative measures are needed.

'FIFA, the Brazilian authorities and the World Cup sponsors must use their influence and experience to communicate the risk.'

Although it cannot be passed from human to human a non-infected insect that bites someone with dengue then becomes a carrier - passing the disease to the next person it targets.

It's transmitted by urban, day-biting Aedes mosquitoes which makes it a particular problem in towns and cities.

Infected visitors can also inadvertently bring home the disease to their native country.

Professor Hay and colleagues explored the risk to football fans by examining maps of the distribution of dengue in Brazil and records of its seasonal variation at key sites.

Dengue is a viral infection that can cause a range of symptoms, from mild flu-like illness to more serious illnesses including rashes and bone pain.

Severe and potentially deadly forms develop in around 5 percent of patients.

Dengue usually clears up by itself within around 1-2 weeks.

There are no specific medications to treat the disease, but symptoms can be managed by taking paracetamol, drinking plenty of fluids and resting.

The study published in Nature showed outbreaks will be highest when matches are played in Fortaleza, Natal and Salvador - all in the north east of the country.

England will find out where they will initially be based when the draw for the group stages takes place on 6 December.

Professor Hay, of Oxford University, said: 'I don't want to dissuade anyone from going to the World Cup - nor to single out Brazil - which is one of more than 100 countries battling dengue worldwide.

'My aim is to inform unwary spectators about the risk and how they can protect themselves.'

Despite being a tropical disease cases have been reported in France and Croatia.

After it struck the island of Madeira last year the World Health Organisation warned of a future European outbreak.

There is no vaccine so people heading out next summer should pack plenty of light-coloured long trousers and long-sleeved shirts along with mosquito-repellant sprays for exposed areas of skin.

Professor Hay said: 'The Brazilian authorities should implement aggressive vector control in April and May - particularly around the northern stadiums - to decrease the number of dengue-transmitting mosquitoes.

'They can target adult Aedes mosquitoes through fogging - the use of aerosol formulations of insecticides that disperse efficiently - and can interrupt breeding by clearing sites at which the mosquitoes lay their eggs - water collected in discarded rubbish for example.

'There are no vaccines or drugs against dengue but an individual will never contract dengue if they do not get bitten by an infected mosquito in the first place. So avoiding mosquito bites is the best precaution.

'Select accomodation with screened windows and doors and air conditioning; use insecticides indoors; wear clothing that covers the arms and legs especially during early morning and late afternoon when the chance of being bitten is greatest; and apply insect repellant to clothing and exposed skin.'

England fans have already snapped up more than 28,000 match tickets for Brazil - even before they know where the team will be playing.

So keen are they to witness glory in June and July they are only behind the host country themselves, the US and Germany in the global rush - despite basic travel packages costing a whopping Â£7,000.
