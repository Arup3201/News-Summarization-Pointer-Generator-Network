You might think that selfies are only taken by preening teenagers, but they could be taken by hapless thieves too as front-facing smartphone cameras are also being used to fight crime.

A San Francisco-based security firm has created a product that will email victims of smartphone theft a photo of the person who has snatched their phone.

The photo, known as a ‘theftie’ will also be accompanied by a map of the device’s location, which could be useful if a thief has dumped a valuable device.

Security firm Lookout has introduced Theft Alerts to its anti-theft smartphone product.

They provide users with alerts when suspicious activity occurs on their iPhone or Android handset.

Thieves often remove a SIM card and turn off a device after stealing it to prevent the owner from tracking it.

So the Theft Alert service sends the victim an email with a photo of the thief and a map of the device's location within minutes, to give the victim the best chance of recovering their handset - and with it, private information.

Actions that trigger an alert and talk a 'theftie' - a picture of the thief taken with the handset's front-facing camera, - include: entering an incorrect password, removing a SIM card, enabling airplane mode, turning the phone off and removing Lookout.

The stolen phone’s camera will be triggered when a thief enters a wrong password, turns the device off or takes out the SIM card - accidentally taking a selfie, which is emailed to the phone's registered owner.

Lookout, the company behind the idea, added the new 'Theft Alert' to its premium service, which is designed to be used on iPhones and Android handsets.

‘We are not providing this information for you to go out and find the device yourself,’ Lookout’s product manager Greg Lou said. ‘It is so you can give it to the police so they can find it for you.’

The premium version of Lookout costs $3 a month or $30 for the year and includes features such as backing up data, virus protection and finding lost phones.

It is available on Android for £1.99 per month or £19.99 annually and iOS for £1.99 per month or £20.99 annually in the UK.

The new capability will let users tell smartphones to send theft alerts if anyone botches a password or puts the device in 'airplane' mode to block network connections. These actions are commonly taken by smartphone thieves to stop an owner tracking their handset.

On Android phones, such alerts will instruct front-facing cameras to take photos in the hope of capturing images of culprits.

The capability referred to by Lookout as taking a ‘theftie’ is not available on Apple devices because the operating system won't allow it, according to Mr Lou.

Emails that include maps of the location of stolen devices are sent to owners. In the case of Android, the emails include copies of ‘thefties’ taken with front-facing cameras.

Kevin Mahaffey, co-founder and CTO of Lookout, said: ‘From the day we started Lookout, we've dedicated ourselves to fighting smartphone theft.

‘Today, the problem has grown so large that nearly 70 per cent of phone theft victims never get their phone back. This is not right. That's why we decided to build Theft Alerts, a real-time service that intelligently arms users with information they need to get their precious devices and data back.’

Mr Lou said: 'Phone theft is becoming a really big problem.’ Politicians in the UK and U.S. agree and are putting pressure on phone companies to do more to stop the problem.

One in 10 smartphone users in France, UK, Germany and the U.S. have had their phones stolen, according to a report by IDG Research on behalf of Lookout.

Google and Apple provide tracking services to locate lost phones and some smartphones made by LG have a ‘kill switch’ to allow an owner to remotely lock a device.

Lookout launched in 2007 and reports that 55 million people worldwide use its mobile security software, a version of which is free.
