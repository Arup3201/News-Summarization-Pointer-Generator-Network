Napoli forward Marek Hamsik admitted that his side fear Juventus, but insisted the Serie A champions can be beaten in Monday's Supercoppa Italiana clash in Doha, Qatar.

The meeting of the Coppa Italia winners and Scudetto holders is a rematch of the 2012 final, which saw Juventus come from behind twice to secure a 3-2 win in extra time.

The Old Lady have begun this campaign in ominous form, and currently sit top of Serie A, three points clear of their nearest challengers, Roma.

Napoli sit third with 27 points despite only picking up one win from their previous five league matches.

And ahead of Monday's encounter, Hamsik has revealed that despite Juventus' form making them a formidable opponent, they can be beaten on the day.

'The Super Cup is extremely important. I love the idea of lifting the trophy,' Hamsik said.

'Juventus are to be feared, as they know how to win and the team is full of champions, but this is a one-off game so anything can happen.

'If we beat Juve, it'll be hugely satisfying for us and our fans, sending a positive image of Napoli and the city. 

'We can do it if we replicate the performance against Roma.'

The Slovakian also admits the clash in China two years ago is not easy to forget, and still feels regret that Napoli lost the tie.

'I've scored against Juve several times and each one of them was wonderful,' Hamsik added.

'Above all, I remember the double in Turin. We hadn't won there for more than 20 years. There was also the goal in the Coppa Italia Final, our first trophy together.

'This time we're playing on an international stage, like we were in Beijing for the Super Cup in 2012. We shouldn't have lost that game, not like that. It was a hard match and we could've won.'
