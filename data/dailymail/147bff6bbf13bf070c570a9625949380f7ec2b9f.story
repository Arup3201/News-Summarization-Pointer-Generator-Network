This restless black bear cub clearly struggled to find the perfect spot for his afternoon nap as he refused to sit still and wriggled around on the branch of a maple tree. 

The five-month-old bear kept waking up and changing position after climbing up the tree trunk with his mother and sibling.

The cub was photographed in his pursuit for a comfortable spot by Canadian wildlife photographer Megan Lorenz, 38, while she was watching the family relax at Georgian Bay, Ontario.

Comfortable? Canadian wildlife photographer Megan Lorenz, 38, captured these images while she was watching the family relax at Georgian Bay, Ontario

Ms Lorenz, of Etobicoke, Ontario, said she took the pictures after spotting a female bear and her two cubs resting in a tree.

She said: 'Black bears spend a great deal of time sleeping - and since it was a warm day and the cubs were safe, the mum decided it was time for a nap.

'The mum slept most of the time I was there, but one of the cubs seemed very restless.

'The little guy kept waking up, scratching and looking at me before finding another position to lie down.

'The cub seemed so curious and although he was tired, he seemed to be trying to stay awake.'

Standing 20 feet away from the tree, Ms Lorenz was able to observe the cub for two hours as he constantly changed his position in a bid to get comfortable.

Black bear cubs remain close to their mother until the age of two or four years old.

During this time they learn crucial survival techniques, such as where to find food, how to hunt and defend themselves, as well as where to den.

Ms Lorenz said: 'This was such a special sighting for me and I couldn't help laughing at the cub's antics as he sat 15 feet above me.

'However, when photographing the moment I did feel very aware of my surroundings, since there were other bears in the area.

'It was important to know where I needed to move to once the bears climbed down the tree. You definitely want to make sure that you are not between a bear and her cubs.

'Black bears can move much faster than we can so the key to photographing them safely is to watch for signs that they are nervous and leave when that happens.

'Although, honestly, I worry more about the safety of the bears than my own. So many interactions between predators and people in Ontario end up with the predator being shot.'
