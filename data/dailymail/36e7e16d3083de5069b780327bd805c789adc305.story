Victim: Jewellery designer Michael Griffiths was hog-tied before being tortured and burned alive

Three gang members who tortured a jewellery designer in an attempt to gain access to his safe before setting him on fire and leaving him to die inside his burning home have been jailed for a total of 90 years.

Harvey Mumford, Zac Cowdrey and Simon Penton went to 'extraordinary lengths' to target Michael Griffiths, 59, tracking him down on the internet before conducting reconnaissance on his house in Fernhurst, Surrey.

They first attempted to con their way into his property by pretending to be police officers wearing hi-vis jackets and after that failed they broke into his home while he was out and lay in wait for him to return.

When Mr Griffiths, who was described as a 'wonderful, fun-loving person', arrived he was stunned and 'hog-tied' with his hands and ankles bound together before being brutally tortured in the hope he'd give up the key to his safe, thought to contain diamonds worth £40,000.

The gang then poured petrol onto him and onto the surrounding ground and set him on fire before callously leaving him to burn to death.

Cowdrey, 24, and Mumford, 23, both of Staines, Surrey, were found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 32 years.

Penton, 43, of Sunbury, Surrey, was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to 26 years in Prison.

After passing sentence, Judge Michael Lawson said: 'There was a complete plan to cause some harm to Mr Griffiths. This plan was exceeded by Cowdrey and Mumford.

'Mr Griffiths was overpowered to get to the valuable property you thought was in his safe.

'The use of green hi-visibility jackets and identifying yourselves as policemen were deliberate acts to gain access to the house. It only failed because Mr Griffiths never answered the door.

'The project was not called off on the 22nd. It was far too valuable. On the 23rd you went back to check if Mr Griffiths was in. When he wasn’t, you called the team and sent them to come down and await his return.

'When Mr Griffiths entered he was stunned and hog-tied in most unpleasant fashion and then force was exerted on him in the hope he would give up the location of the key.

'Mr Penton, you knew some force was to be used including strangulation, probably with his own neck-tie.

'We have not heard any genuine expression of remorse and no time was wasted in returning to the house and destroying evidence.

'Mr Mumford poured petrol on the ground floor and on Mr Griffiths himself and you then lit it and there was unsurprisingly a fast and terrifying fire.'

Simon Penton, 27, was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to 26 years in prison

Prosecutor Christine Laing told the six-week trial Mr Griffiths had a jewellery workshop and also worked at auction houses where it was common knowledge he had two diamonds at home worth about £40,000.

The court was told firefighters who discovered his body in January 2013 first thought Mr Griffiths was disabled and had been unable to escape the blaze after he was found lying against the front door with his legs and hands tied together with cables.

The diamonds were found by police stored in picnic flasks which had removable compartments.

Detective Chief Inspector Jeff Riley, who led the hunt for the killers, said he had rarely witnessed such callous
 disregard for life and that during the trial absolutely no remorse was 
shown by any members of the group for their shocking behaviour and 
actions.

He said: 'Michael was not easy to fool so they then had to adapt their plan by targeting his home whilst he was out and laying in wait for his return.

'He was then subjected to a prolonged and serious assault that ended in him losing his life.

'He was callously left tied up by those responsible, not caring if he was still alive or dead.

'The group then left Fernhurst and over the next 24 hours set about disposing and destroying any items that could link them to the scene, including clothing, mobile phones and even a motor vehicle used to transport them.

'They then plotted to return and destroy any remaining evidence by pouring petrol over the crime scene including Michael’s body before setting fire to it.'

In a statement Mr Griffiths’ family said no sentence would ever be enough for the people involved in his death.

'Unfortunately we now live in a world of greed and violence,' they said. 'Perhaps they could imagine the pain if it were to happen to one of their own family?

'Michael loved life in his own way, working with jewellery and antiques and he was extremely talented in producing one-off designs for people.

'He was very happy socialising with the local community in Fernhurst. Michael we miss you, God Bless.'

Rudder was found guilty of two counts of conspiracy to burgle, but was cleared on two other counts and also cleared of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. She was jailed for three years.

Rebecca Rogers, aged 39 years, from Shepperton, who had faced one charge of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, was cleared.

Mr Griffiths brother, Martin said: 'There are no words to describe the effect that night had on Michael’s family.

'The first thing in the morning we think of is him and the last thing at night.

'Eventually we will get to cope with it but at the moment it is unreal.

'Michael never had a fight with anyone in his life. He was a wonderful, fun-loving person who nursed both his parents in their later years.

'Not a day goes by when we don’t think of Michael and the terrible injuries that were inflicted on him.

'We now live in a world of greed and violence and no sentence can begin to make up for the offence.'
