The number of homes where no one works has fallen by nearly a quarter of a million over the past two years, figures showed yesterday. It means more people are taking jobs rather than living on state benefits, suggesting the Coalition’s welfare reforms may be having an effect.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has tried to cut back on the misuse of disability and sickness benefits and has capped Housing Benefit, while trying to get those dependent on benefits into the job market.

The figures, from the Office for National Statistics, show that the number of households living on benefits has fallen to its lowest level since the recession began to bite four years ago.

Never worked households: Official figures show this number has nearly always gone up for 16 years and is currently at 340,000 in 2012

The number of jobless households in 
April, May and June was down 153,000 on the same period last year and 
was 244,000 fewer than the spring of 2010.

But there were still 3,676,000 jobless households in the period, according to the figures.

Some 17.9 per cent of all homes now 
have no one with a job, down from 19.2 per cent when the Coalition came 
to power. But five million adults still live in homes without work.

Around 1.75million children lived in 
households where no one worked, 60,000 fewer than last year. And the 
number of homes – apart from student households – where no one has ever 
had a job fell to 265,000, down 26,000 from last spring.

Excluding student households, where everyone is aged 16 to 24 and in full-time education, there were 265,000 households containing only people that have never worked.

This represents 1.3 per cent of all households in the UK.

War of words: Stephen Timms, left, says that the Government is not getting to grips with unemployment but minister Chris Grayling, right, says that it shows the Coalition's benefits reforms are working

Experts warn that the issue often leads to social problems as families
with no history
of work are most likely to be involved in crime and their children are 
most likely to slip into a cycle of truancy, drug abuse and disorder.

Labour told MailOnline today that the Government was failing to get to grips with the problem.

Shadow
Employment Secretary Stephen Timms said: 'Today’s slight fall in the 
number of workless households is welcome but after two years of failure 
this government is barely scratching the surface of Britain’s jobs 
crisis.

'There are 
still far too many workless households but ministers seem incapable of 
getting to grips with the problem. Their back to work schemes aren’t 
delivering and our economy remains stuck in a double dip recession of 
this government’s making.'

Shock: Britain's dole queue is dropping slowly but there is a worrying number of households where none of the residents have ever had a job

Overall, official Government figures 
released today show the number of households where there are no people 
in employment, including those who have worked previously, has gone down
by 0.8 per cent.

The 
Office for National Statistics (ONS) said this was 3.7 million in 2012 -
down 153,000 on a year earlier. But it is still higher than the 
pre-recession level of 3.4 million.

Depressing: ONS figures show here the number of households containing whole families who have never had a job

It means almost one in five homes have no employed adults.

Sickness continues to be the main reason for being out of work in the long-term.

The Government said today that these drops showed their welfare reforms are working.

Chris Grayling, the employment minister, said: 'These are encouraging
figures. Through our welfare reforms more people are entering the 
workplace and more children are living in a household that works.

'However,
we can't be complacent. The economy remains a substantial challenge, 
which is why we need the right employment support to ensure that those 
living in workless households and their children are given the 
opportunities and help to succeed.'

The data also reveals a worrying north-south divide, where in some areas up to a quarter of households are out of work.

The North East had the highest rate of workless households at 
24.5 per cent, while the South East had the lowest at 14.1 per cent.

For the UK as a whole in 2012, around 
17.9 per cent of households were in that position, but seven areas of 
the UK that were above that average.

'There are some stark differences across the country. For example, in the north-east of the country, 24.5 per cent of households are workless and in the south-east, just over 14%,' ONS expert Jamie Jenkins said.

Out of work: The majority of people who are long-term unemployed are suffering from health problems

The latest data released by the Office
for National Statistics (ONS) also showed that the number of households
where all adults that live in it work has also fallen.

From
April to June this year there were 10.9 million such households, 
representing 53 per cent and a fall of 36,000 of homes with at least one
person aged 16 to 64 where all adult members are in employment.

During
the same period there were 3.7 million UK households with at least one 
member aged 16 to 64 where no one was in work, representing 17.9 per 
cent of households. This was the second consecutive fall, compared to 
2010 when almost four million UK households had no adults in work.

Sickness, both long-term and temporary, was the main reason given for not working by those people aged 16 to 64 living in workless households, accounting for 1.45 million or around three in every 10 workless people.

The second most common reason given was 
being unemployed, accounting for 1.03 million, or around one in five. 
The next three most common reasons were looking after the family, 
retirement and study.

North-south divide: The north-east has the highest number of unemployed households, many more than in the south

If fully retired and student households are removed, the number of households in the UK that are workless goes down to 2.92 million.

The ONS said there was a rise of 246,000 in mixed households - those containing some people in work and some who are not. The number stood at 5.97 million, or 29.1% of the total.

The lowest number of workless households was in 2006, two years before the economic downturn hit the UK. Then the number of workless households was 3.4 million or 17.3% - 0.6% lower than this year.
