As the man charged with ensuring the finer details of England’s attacking game are in working order, it would have been understandable to find Mike Catt in a much darker mood than he was on Tuesday.

Three days after watching his team score three tries from 12 clean line breaks against Scotland, Catt bristled more at the suggestion something needs fixing than at any residual annoyance at the raft of chances that went begging at Twickenham.

With 11 tries in four RBS 6 Nations games so far — and France to come on Saturday in a game that could see England break their run of three successive runners-up finishes by winning the championship — Catt believes they are not being given enough credit for a sustained intent to keep the ball in hand while others prefer to look skywards in hope.

England coach Mike Catt wants England to be more ruthless when it comes to scoring points

‘Ninety-nine per cent of the things were very good,’ said the World Cup winner turned skills coach. ‘Obviously not transferring the stuff we created into points was something we were all very frustrated with.

‘At international level, the guys have to understand you only have two or three opportunities. You might not get five or six like we had on the weekend.

‘We need to make sure we convert those into points. The players are more frustrated than anybody but we are not going to throw anything out with the bath water. It is all about us sticking to what we are doing, because it is working.’

With three wins from four games and a small points advantage over nearest challengers Ireland, it is hard to argue, even considering their no-show in Dublin.

England’s build-up play was, at times, exceptional against Scotland, even if their decision-making with the try line in view bordered on the dim-witted.

Stuart Lancaster names his side to face France on Thursday, when Leicester duo Geoff Parling and Tom Youngs appear certain to be in the line-up for the first time in this championship.

The French made countless errors in dispatching Italy on Sunday and will have just six days to rest up for their final match, which kicks off last at 5pm and will see England knowing what is required to deliver the first notable piece of silverware of Lancaster’s reign.

Jonathan Joseph and George Ford must be at their creative best to defeat a strong-tackling French midfield

England’s players watched helplessly hours after thrashing Italy as Ireland narrowly beat France in the final game last season to snatch the title from their grasp. Many believe the staggered kick-off times to suit television undermine the tournament.

Catt added: ‘We don’t control it. It’s very tough because international matches are brutal. And when you are travelling a lot of the time, that can take three days out of your preparation time and recovery. It impedes you a bit.’

England will take comfort from knowing if Ireland run up a big score against Scotland to leave them needing to chase the game against France, they have stumbled upon a backline capable of cutting teams to ribbons.

Jonathan Joseph, playing because of injuries to Manu Tuilagi and Brad Barritt at the start of the tournament, has been a revelation. He is the championship’s leading try-scorer with four in four games and, at 23, looks to the manner born.

His performances at outside centre have been so good he is now regularly compared to the prince of English centres Jeremy Guscott, and the Bath three- quarter is confident of England’s chances, despite Saturday’s missed opportunities.

‘It was frustrating and a lot of negatives have been drawn from that game (Scotland), but as a team we created a lot,’ he said.

‘We feel we have come on massively in terms of putting defences under stress.

‘We’re happy with what we have created. Now it is just a case of doing the last bit. The easier bit is the finishing. It’s something we’ll work on. I don’t think there is any need to panic.’
