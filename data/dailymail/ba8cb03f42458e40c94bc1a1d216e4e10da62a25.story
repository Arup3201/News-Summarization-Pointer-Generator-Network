The Canadian man on trial for the rape and murder of a Chinese student in her Toronto apartment while her horrified boyfriend watched helplessly on Skype in Beijing was found guilty on Monday.

Brian Dickson, 32, did not show any emotion as he was convicted of the first degree murder of 23-year-old Qian Liu in April 2011, receiving a life-sentence with no chance of parole for 25-years.

Liu's father broke down in tears as the verdict was delivered - bringing an end to three years of trauma for the family after the York University student's boyfriend watched her fend off Dickson before calmly turning the computer off.

 Anne Molloy imposed a life sentence with no chance of parole for 25

Liu was found dead after her boyfriend managed to contact authorities after he witnessed the last moments of his girlfriends life.

Robert Nuttall, Dickson's lawyer, said his client has been 'absolutely remorseful for a very long time.'

'He didn't say anything. He just accepted the verdict,' Nuttall said. 'It was a very tough case. A very, very tragic case.'

'The case hung on the mechanism of death. The jury struggled with it, the jury made their decision and they made their decision of first-degree murder,' said Nuttall.

Nuttall said his client accepted the verdict.

'Mr. Dickson has always had his eyes wide open.'

The prosecution presented the theory that Dickson forced himself on Liu then killed her by asphyxiation to cover it up.

Liu, who was 23, had moved to Canada to study English. Dickson lived in an apartment in the same house as Liu, just outside the campus of York University.

Nuttal said it's too early to say if Dickson will appeal the verdict.

'He's been absolutely remorseful for a very, very long period of time,' he said.

Last month, the shocking testimony of Liu's boyfriend, Xian Chao Meng reduced the court room to silence.

He explained through an interpreter how he Dickson burst through the door of the his girlfriend's basement studio while he was on Skype with her before he heard two 'muffled bangs' and then silence.

Moments later Dickson appeared naked from the abdomen down in front of the computer and quickly turned it off.

Liu was found dead in April 2011, just a few hours after her boyfriend in China watched via webcam as she tried to fend off an attacker who appeared at her door. The boyfriend told police he saw Liu struggling with a man before her computer was shut off

Liu's naked body was found covered in blood and semen on April 16, 2011.

According to Meng, the night before he had been talking to Liu for hours on both Skype and QQ, which is China's version of MSN.

He was on his laptop in Beijing, where it was about noon, while Liu was doing homework in Toronto, where she attended York University and it was about midnight.

The couple had broken up three months earlier but remained friends, catching up every couple of weeks.

Meng told the court he could see Liu, wearing a headset, sitting in front of the computer in her apartment just south of the university campus.

Also visible in the frame was the door, to about knee level.

'She said to me that somebody was knocking on the door. She would check,' he said.

Liu rose to answer the light knock, saying something through the door first in English, which Meng couldn't understand.

As Liu opened the door partway to her visitor, Meng caught sight of a man standing in the door frame.

'A foreigner, not a Chinese,' he said.

The man, his hair mussed in the front, was wearing a half-sleeved dark-colored crewneck T-shirt and loose shorts.

'After the door was opened, the two had a chat close to the door frame,' Meng told court.

It seemed to Meng that the male asked to see Liu's cellphone.

The jury heard earlier that Liu had been having Wi-Fi issues and had asked other tenants — the building was full of student residents — for help resolving them.

Liu, said Meng, got her phone and handed it to the man.

'He did some operation on the cellphone.'

While the visitor was thus occupied, Liu sat back down at her computer.

Meng saw her face in profile as she spoke to the male.

'The man was in and out of the door frame,' Meng testified.

'It seemed that he was hesitant.'

They appeared to be parting when 'all of a sudden, something abnormal took place,' said Meng.

'That male tried to force his way in. Liu was trying hard to push the door, not to let him in. She could not prevent him from entering. He wanted to embrace Qian Liu. (She) was all the time pushing at his chest.'

Meng heard Liu say 'No'  in Cantonese.

'Maybe she felt he did not understand. Then she said 'No' in English. But that person did not listen.'

There was a struggle, visible to Meng.

'Qian Lu was pinned.'

Liu then fell out of camera range.

'Then I heard two muffled bangs. From then, I heard no more sound from Qian Liu.'

In the silence that followed, Meng said he heard the man breathing heavily and, shortly afterwards, what he thought sounded like furniture being moved.

The light in Liu's room was shut off.

Meng thinks he heard what may have been the jingle of keys.

The male next appeared directly in front of the computer.

'He was already naked. I could see the part of his body below the abdomen to the knees. He leaned forward to shut off the computer.'

When the webcam was turned off, Meng continued to make an audio recording; he and Liu had simultaneously been communicating by cellphone.

That connection was still open and the tape was played for the jury.

What Meng thought was keys jingling might also be the sound of a belt unbuckling.

Meng is also heard swearing in Cantonese.

'This is the only way I let out what I was feeling . . . I was stunned.'

An autopsy could not determine definitively how Liu died, though a pathologist has testified it was likely by 'mechanical asphyxiation,' with compression applied to her neck.

Male DNA from swabs of a substance lifted from Liu's breasts was matched — to a degree of probability estimated to be 1 in 25 trillion — to Dickson.

Semen found on Liu's groin area matched Dickson to a probability of 1 in 2.7 quintillion, and DNA from a small blood stain on a blue T-shirt seized from Dickso's first-floor apartment matched Liu to a probably of 1 in 140 quadrillion.
