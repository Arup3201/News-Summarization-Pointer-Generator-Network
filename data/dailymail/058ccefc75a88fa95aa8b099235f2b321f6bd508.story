An Australian man has been charged after he took off with an ice cream truck from the Central Coast of New South Wales on Monday morning.

The 45-year-old allegedly stole the Peters Ice Cream vehicle near Newcastle train station just before 9am, and made off with the treat-filled truck.

About half an hour later police discovered the van making its way south down the Pacific Highway where a police pursuit was initiated with police cars hot on the sweet thief's tail.

A Peters Ice Cream truck was nabbed from Newcastle on the NSW Central Coast on Monday

Nearly a dozen police cars joined in the chase and road spikes were used a number of times in an attempt to get the driver to pull over.

'Road spikes were deployed on the road at Pacific Highway in Catherine Hill Bay and again at Doyalson, shredding the front tyres of the truck', NSW Police said in a statement.

Peters Ice-cream have since confirmed to Nine News it was in fact one of their vehicles that went missing, and the chase spanned for almost an hour before the culprit was caught.

The sweet treat thief was chased by nearly a dozen police cars for more than 50 kilometres before he was arrested and charged

More than 50 kilometres down the coast the man was arrested after he apparently stopped the truck in Blue Haven and attempted a quick getaway on foot.

He didn't make it far before he was taken to Wyong Police Station by officers.

The 45-year-old was charged with being unlicenced for the class of vehicle he was driving, destroying or damaging property, police pursuit (Skye's Law) and taking a driving a conveyance without consent of the owner.

He appeared at Wyong Local Court on Monday afternoon and was again refused bail to appear at Wyong Local Court on Monday 8 September 2014.
