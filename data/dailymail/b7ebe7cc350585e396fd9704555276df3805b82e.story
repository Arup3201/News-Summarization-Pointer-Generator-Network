A mocked-up image of a plus-size Barbie beside a traditional Barbie has sparked a debate about the doll's impact on female body image.

The Facebook group Plus Size Modeling shared the powerful post a week ago, with the question: 'Should toy companies start making plus-sized Barbie dolls? In all honesty, we want to know...'

Since then, it has generated nearly 36,000 likes and over 1,600 shares - as well as mostly negative comments from many who felt the plus-size Barbie was an inaccurate representation of curvy women.

Plus-size... or obese? A mocked-up image of a plus-size Barbie beside a traditional Barbie by Worth100 has sparked a debate about the doll's impact on female body image

One user, Kyle Boise, wrote: 'Yeah lets promote poor health and eating habits. Just what America needs.'

And Lindsay Keg-leg Kahlig commented: '[The] average [dress] size these days is 14-16. A doll that shows 
real life perspective, rather than the ideal unhealthy weight like 0 or 
unhealthy negative display of obese is a better more healthy approach [sic].'

Melissa Audet added: 'I hope she comes with a blood pressure
 cuff to show young girls that how many chins she has is not what's 
important but the health issues that could come along with being this 
size.'

Indeed, the doll's chins, in particular, sparked ridicule.

Lauren Johnson wrote: 'I think the double chin is ridiculous!'

And MaryBeth Gafford said: 'The triple chin is too much. Most overweight
 people (me included) only have a double chin no matter what size they 
are. This Barbie is inaccurate.'

'I hope she comes with a blood pressure
 cuff... What's 
important is the health issues that could come along with being this 
size'

The dominant opinion, though, was that that there should be a middle ground. Rather than promoting an exaggeratedÂ  'obese' Barbie, young girls should have a healthy-looking doll that is neither too fat nor too thin.

'Why not have a realistically proportioned Barbie that promotes healthy diet and exercise?' Michelle Ashford suggested, while Bec Bailey wrote: 'Not plus size but definitely healthy weight. A size 12-14 
girl would be a great image. Too low or too high a BMI promotes 
unhealthy living.'

The image was produced by 
Worth1000.com rather than Barbie's manufacturer, Mattel, and so if the 
company was to consider a plus-size Barbie, it might look very 
different.

And nor is Worth1000 the first to have considered the concept of a larger doll.

Barbie vs a 'healthy' woman: Artist Nickolay Lamm created a Barbie-like doll based on CDC measurements of the average 19-year-old woman, and photographed it alongside a traditional Barbie doll

Artist Nickolay Lamm, 24, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, created a Barbie-like doll based on CDC measurements of the average 19-year-old woman, and photographed it alongside a traditional Barbie doll.

'If Barbie looks 
good as an average sized woman in America, what's stopping Mattel from making one?'

His research into the iconic doll found that if she were to exist as a human, Barbie would weigh about 110lbs - or 7 stone, 8lbs - and would have a BMI of 16.24. This would fit the weight criteria for anorexia.

He told Huffington Post at the time: 'A realistically-proportioned Barbie actually looks pretty good in the pictures I produced.

'So, if there's even a small chance of Barbie in its present form negatively influencing girls, and if Barbie looks good as an average sized woman in America, what's stopping Mattel from making one?'

Many commenters believe that instead of an 'obese' Barbie, there should be a 'normal-sized' doll that exemplifies healthy eating habits
