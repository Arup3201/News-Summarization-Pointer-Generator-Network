The North-South divide over the cost of a home has widened even further as new figures show asking prices in London are 42 per cent higher than before the recession.

A study by property website Rightmove has found house sellers' asking prices in Cambridgeshire, Berkshire, Surrey and the capital have made the strongest gains since the financial crisis struck.

But those in County Durham, the Isle of Wight, West Yorkshire and Teesside have the furthest distance still to recover, according to the website.

With an average price tag of £1.5 million, average asking prices in central London and the City now tower 41.9 per cent above the levels seen when the housing market was at its pre-crisis peak in May 2008, Rightmove found.

West London, which like central London has been a strong pull for wealthy overseas investors, has seen the next strongest price growth since the previous peak of the market, with average property asking prices now standing at £564,192, which is 41.7 per cent higher than in May 2008.

The study, which covered England and Wales, found that at the other end of the scale, property prices in County Durham had the biggest percentage jump still left to climb to reach their levels at the previous peak of the market.

The average asking price in County Durham stands at £114,554, which is 13.4 per cent below the typical amount requested by sellers in May 2008.

In Teesside and West Yorkshire, asking prices are still around 9.1 per cent below 2008 levels, while in the Isle of Wight they still have a 10.7 per cent climb.

All areas of London have seen asking prices increase by at least 30 per cent when compared with May 2008, Rightmove said.

The study also found that asking prices in South Wales are at 1.9 per cent below their 2008 levels. Pictured here are homes for sale in Cardiff

Outside London, Cambridgeshire has seen the strongest recovery in sellers' asking prices, Rightmove found, with prices up by 21.9 per cent on their 2008 levels to reach £311,933 typically.

The London commuter belt areas of Berkshire and Surrey have seen the next strongest asking price growth, recording increases of 16.4 per cent and 16.1 per cent respectively since 2008.

Looking further north, Rightmove found that only a handful of areas have seen asking prices surpass their pre-crisis peak levels.

Cheshire and North Yorkshire bucked the general northern trend, with asking prices there having nudged above the previous peak of the market.

House sellers' asking prices in Cheshire are now 1.1 per cent higher than in 2008, standing at £213,618 on average.

Those in North Yorkshire have reached £244,776, which is 0.1 per cent higher than in 2008.

But stepping over the North Yorkshire border into Lancashire, asking prices in the county are still 9 per cent below the peak of the market, at £153,339 typically.

The study also found that asking prices in South Wales are at 1.9 per cent below their 2008 levels, while those in North and Mid Wales have a 6.9 per cent climb to get back to the 2008 peak.

The figures come from a new 'house price trendometer' tool which Rightmove has created to allow people to see how asking prices in their area have fared since the website's records started in 2001. 

Miles Shipside, director of Rightmove, said: 'While at a high level the South has out-performed the North, being able to dig underneath that courtesy of the millions of properties advertised on Rightmove since 2001 shows a really varied county versus county performance.'
