The youngest daughter of New York mayor Michael Bloomberg has revealed how proud she is to share her millionaire father's name - a decade after telling the world it 'sucks'.

Georgina Bloomberg, who is who is reportedly worth $11.5 billion and is due to give birth to her first child in December, made headlines in 2003 when she told an HBO documentary that: 'Having the last name Bloomberg sucks.'

Four years later, the tongue-pierced socialite and professional show jumper, 30, was named the fourth 'most intriguing 
billionaire heiress' by Forbes for 'defying the stereotype of the bon-bon popping princess'.

Indulgent: Mr Bloomberg, 71, has indulged his daughter's passion for equestrian and paid for at least six horses, which she keeps on estates in North Salem, New York, and Wellington, Florida

But describing herself as a 'rebellious teenager [who] wanted to get things pierced and smoke cigarettes on the street corner', she told Glamour.com she now regrets making the statement.

'I was only 19; 11 years later I feel completely differently,' Georgina said. 'Today I’m very appreciative of who my family is and how hard my father works. I’m proud to be a Bloomberg.'

The Bloomberg family are among the 
richest in America and Mr Bloomberg has an estimated personal fortune of
$18.1billion earned through his eponymous financial information 
company.

But the 
69-year-old has made no secret of the fact that his daughter’s career 
costs a lot of money as show horses can cost hundreds of thousands of 
dollars a year to keep.

'My father lacks a filter, and it’s gotten him in trouble,' Georgina said. 'A couple of years ago, he gave a speech at the Nathan’s hot
dog eating contest at Coney Island. It was badly written and cheesy, 
and he stopped and said loudly over the microphone, "Who wrote this 
sh**?"

'Something about that moment made me realize how glad I am that he is
my father. He’s not just your typical politician: He says what he 
believes, no matter how it comes out. I willingly inherited that trait, 
and one day I’ll share that story with my son.'

'This sucks': She made headlines in 2003 when she told an HBO documentary that: 'Having the last name Bloomberg sucks'

Saying she and Argentinian boyfriend Ramiro Quintana have no plans to marry despite having a baby together, she added: 'Ramiro and I won’t be typical parents, but that doesn’t mean we’ll 
be worse parents: I believe in love as much as the next person, and I 
would love to be with one person for the rest of my life. But I don’t 
need a marriage license and a party.

'I believe it takes more strength to do this than to go get engaged like everybody else.'

Mr Bloomberg, 71, has indulged his daughter's passion for equestrian and paid for at least six horses, which she keeps on estates in North Salem, New York, and Wellington, Florida.

The family also have a lavish property portfolio including neighboring waterfront homes in Bermuda for Miss Bloomberg.

But their personal lives were thrown into the spotlight two years ago when Miss Bloomberg published her novel 'The A Circuit.'

The book concerns Wall St billionaire Rick Aaronson, his two daughters and their family squabbles.

His eldest daughter Camille went to an Ivy League colleague and wants to move into politics.

His youngest daughter Tommi is an award-winning horse rider who refuses to do what her father tells her.

'She wasn't afraid to say no to her father,' Tommi says in the book. 'Even if half of Wall Street was.'

By coincidence, Miss Bloomberg's sister Emma went to Princeton and now works with her father City Hall in New York. Another parallel is Miss Bloomberg's own interest in horses.

Georgina is due to give birth on Christmas day with Mayor Bloomberg's first grandchild.

But she has said she is not planning to marry her boyfriend Argentinian equestrian Ramiro Quintan anytime soon.
