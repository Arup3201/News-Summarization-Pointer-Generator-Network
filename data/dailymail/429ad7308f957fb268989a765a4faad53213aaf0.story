A Pennsylvania couple have avoided jail time after pleading guilty to charges in Indiana for driving cross country with five of their children inside a rented moving truck's unheated cargo area.

A Henry County judge on Tuesday sentenced David Detjen, 41, and his 40-year-old wife, Rebecca, of Fairmont City, Pennsylvania, each to 18 months of probation after accepting their guilty pleas to felony child neglect.

The Detjens were arrested last November at an Interstate 70 truck stop near New Castle as they were driving to California in search of work and a new life.

Outcome: David Detjen (center) and his wife, Rebecca (right), were each sentenced to 18 months of probation after pleading guilty to felony child neglect

Mother speaks: When asked by a reporter whether she thought their sentence was fair, Mrs Detjen answered that she did not know

Police said their children ranging in
age from 9 to 18 were in the freezing cargo area with 18 caged cats. 
Temperatures were in the 30s and police say the back of the truck 
smelled of urine and gasoline.

The Detjens pleaded guilty in May to felony neglect of a dependent carrying an 18-month prison sentence.

Judge Mary Willis said during 
Tuesday's hearing that she was aware of the parents' criminal record, 
including a 2005 child endangerment conviction for both parents and a 
1990 child molestation conviction for the father, who was also found 
guilty of retail theft in 2001, the Muncie Star Press reported.

Under the plea deal, the couple received suspended 18-month jail sentences, minus four days served in an Indiana county jail.

'The facts and circumstances of this case were troubling,' the judge said in court. 'Poor decisions were made.'

However, since their arrest last 
November, Willis said that the Detjens have cooperated with child 
services both in Indiana and Pennsylvania, and have made strides to 
improve their parenting skills.

The couple's case drew national 
attention, with the Detjens receiving offers of financial assistance from 
sympathetic strangers. A Texas resident even paid $20,000 to bond out 
the couple.

Outside the courtroom, the Detjens declined to comment on the outcome of the case. When asked by an RTV6 reporter if she considered their sentence to be fair, Mrs Detjen replied: 'I don't know. I'm not even from here.'

Transport: Five of the couple's seven children and 15 
cats were riding inside the unheated cargo area of the 24-foot Budget 
moving truck which before it was stopped by police in Indiana

Mess on wheels: The back of the truck was piled with the family's belongings, boxes, sleeping bags, appliances and a gas can

The Pennsylvania couple were arrested 
November 28, 2012, in Indiana after a trooper found five of their seven 
children riding in the back of a Budget moving truck along with the 
family’s 15 cats en route to California more than 2,000 away. 

Sgt. John Bowling said the Detjens were traveling to San Bernardino, where the unemployed husband had a job prospect.

The couple were jailed on child neglect charges after their arrest at an eastern Indiana truck stop.

Bowling said Detjen told officers he knew putting his kids and pets in the unheated back of the truck ‘was kind of a stupid idea, but it was sort of a last resort.’

Acting on a tip from the family's relative, State Trooper Nick Razor stopped the 24-foot Budget on Interstate 70 at around 10pm. Inside the cab, the Detjens were seating beside two of their children aged 14 and 15 years old.

When the officer went to the back of the vehicle and pulled the roll-up door, he discovered inside the couple's 18-year-old daughter and her four siblings ranging in age from nine to 17.

Two of the kids were seated on top of boxes stacked high in the cargo area.

Last-ditch effort: The family were en route to San Bernardino, Californoia, more than 2,000 miles away where David Detjan, center back, had a job prospect

The children, dressed in heavy clothing against the bone-chilling 20-degree weather, were traveling inside the unheated cargo area crammed with the family's belongings, boxes, sleeping bags, appliances, a filled gas can and 15 caged cats, The Smoking Gun reported.

Police found two cell phones in the back, leading to believe that the children used the devices to communicate with their parents in the cabin.

By the time they were stopped, the Detjens were on the road for about seven hours, driving nearly 400 miles. 

Following the couple's arrest, the children were placed in the custody of Child Protective Services, while the pets were handed over to Henry County Animal Control.   

Bad idea: Mr Detjan told police that placing his children in the freezing cargo area was 'stupid,' but he had no choice

‘They were down on their luck for sure,’ Bowling told the Indianapolis Star. ‘They didn’t have a car. This was a last-ditch effort to follow up on a possible job in San Bernardino. But it still was an unwise decision.’

The Detjens' children have since been reunited with their parents.
