Edinson Cavani has revealed he is desperate to exact revenge on Chelsea after suffering European heartache against the Blues on two separate occasions. 

The 28-year-old, who is likely to face Chelsea on Tuesday as Paris Saint-Germain take on Jose Mourinho's side in the last 16 of the Champions League, was part of the Napoli side which were eliminated by the west London outfit in 2012. 

Chelsea, who went on to win the prestigious competition, managed to overturn a 3-1 first leg deficit on that occasion - while Cavani and his current PSG team-mates were knocked out by the Blues in April 2014 thanks to a late goal by Demba Ba.

Cavani, speaking to The Sun, said: 'Winning the Champions League is for sure sure our biggest goal after winning Ligue 1 twice.

'Yes, the result of last year hurt but they are in the past. In your life and in your career things like that happen and they stay behind. They help you grow and become stronger. 

'This is another chance we have -- and I have - against Chelsea.'
