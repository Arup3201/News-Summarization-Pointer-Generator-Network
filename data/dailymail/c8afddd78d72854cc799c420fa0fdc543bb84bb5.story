A competitive eater has chewed his way through the UK's most prolific eating challenges consuming more than 200,000 calories.

Ravenous Randy Santel, 28, conquered a 92oz steak challenge, a 60oz burger and 27in pizzas for his eating marathon.

The mountain man from Missouri, who stands at 6ft 5in, finished 42 UK challenges including British traditional feasts such as full English breakfasts and fish and chips.

Randy Santel, 28, traveled from Missouri to the UK to take part in 42 UK food challenges which saw him eat a whopping 200,000 calories. Here he is dong the English Breakfast challenge in Barnsley at Baileys cafe

He devoured a jaw-dropping 205lb of food since his journey began and based on the average calorie intake for men - 2,500 a day - Randy has nearly doubled his daily calorie allowance in just one meal.

Randy said: 'At home around 70 per cent of the challenges are big burgers, so here I tried to tackle British food including my new favourite meal, bangers and mash.

'My favourite challenge so far has been a 12in burger the size of a mini cooper wheel with 200g of chips.

'Everyone was cheering my name, more than a hundred people watched and I even made front page news.

He continued: 'The Brits I've met along the way have been really supportive some even letting me stay with them, I think they're amazed I've travelled so far to take on these challenges.

'One minute I was battling a food challenge next thing I'm at a stranger's home playing Xbox with their son and all because I can eat. It's crazy but great that everyone's been so welcoming.'

On one of the 42 days Randy chewed his way through another giant breakfast challenge complete with toast, eggs, beans, hash browns, chips, sausages, mushrooms, bacon, sausages and black pudding

For this challenge which is called the 'Bagel Boy' Randy had to eat cheesy, beany chips and a giant stuffed bagel 

His final challenge saw him battle a stack of five burgers stacked between five pieces of bacon and five pieces of cheese, with a side portion of chips and coleslaw at Scotty's Steakhouse, Galway.

The epic meal named the Scotty's 5x5 challenge tallies up a whopping total of 9,000 calories, which is nearly four times the recommended amount of calories a man should consume in one day.

Beating the challenge makes him one of 16 people to finish the meal in the half hour time limit as Randy scoffed it  in 18 minutes 28 seconds.

He surpassed his target of reaching the milestone of 250 extreme food victories across the United States and Europe after starting his one-a-day attempts in December.

By comparison, former competitive eater Adam Richman from TV Programme Man Versus Food, completed 48 in two years.

Randy says the most challenging eat on his tour was four individual foot-long breakfast sandwiches and a bowl of chips at Mac's Café in Burton-upon-Trent.

At the Hobgoblin in Bristol Randy ate his way through The Kraken Burger challenge which includes dirty fries, a pile of wings and a giant burger 

Randy said: 'Competitive eating isn't something that everybody can do, most professionals only do three challenges a month - I did one every day with only a couple days of rest.

'I can almost tell you what time I'll finish before my first bite, I know what my body can do so I can work out my tactics from there.

'You wouldn't face a giant burger in the same way you battle a dessert challenge, but with both of them you have to know you can finish it. 

'I don't think anyone in the world could beat the macaroni and cheese challenge I lost, there was a tray full, it was too much, and I barely made it through half.' 

Randy, who has a construction management degree, believes his insatiable appetite started at an early age, at one point weighed more than 23-stone before losing weight through body building.

At Tonys Pizzeria in Glasgow Randy decided to chow down on this 27 inch pizza 

He added: 'I never thought I'd have seen these amazing sights when I was behind a desk in construction jobs, so to have eaten through 75 per cent of the UK's toughest challenges fills me with pride.

'I was sceptical about whether I'd make it but I kept pushing and my body stayed strong, I did it!'

Randy also appeared in US TV show, Spartacus: Gods of the Arena, after winning a Men's Health competition for men to transform their bodies into that of a muscle-clad Spartan in 12 weeks.

Randy lost two stone in two months, dropped down to 16st, but still found he had an impressive appetite for large meals.

He said: 'After winning the competition me and a buddy took on a meat challenge and shocked the owners by completing it, that's when I realised I wanted to pursue this seriously.

'I get my eating from my dad, we were always very hungry men - there's a big joke in my family about there never being any leftovers.

As well as being a competitive eater Randy took part in the US TV show Spartacus: Gods of the Arena after winning a competition with Men's Health to transform his body in 12 weeks 

Randy gets ready to build a burger with a bun the size of a loaf of bread 

'My grandma would tease me saying that I could slow down as no one was trying to steal my food, I think that was an early sign growing up that I could conquer such epic food challenges.

'I was following a career in construction but I'm glad I've converted and can't wait to keep taking on large meals, I feel like it was what I was born to do.

'When I feel full I remember the other billions of people who hate their job, like I used to, who wish they don't have to do it which puts it into perspective - basically I'm eating, working out and travelling - I can't complain.

Back at home in St Peters, Missouri, the competitive eater will be downsizing his meals and opting for healthier options to counterbalance the high calorific intake.

Randy said: 'I'll be on a diet from now on to lose any weight I've gained and to let my body recover, so it'll be back to vegetables for me for a good while.'

'It will be back to canned vegetables and sandwiches for me now - it's a world away from my eating challenges.'

In Bromsgrove Randy tried the Big Davs breakfast challenge eating a breakfast sandwich made from a whole loaf of bread 

At the Amalfis Italian Lounge in Darwen Randy tried the 27 Metro Pizza challenge
