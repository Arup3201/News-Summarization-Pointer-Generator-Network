50 Shades of Grey exploded onto the market in Australia, smashing book sale and box office records with it's tale of the pursuit of pleasure that scandalised some and fascinated others.

Despite backlash from some critics, the film sold out 400 sessions before the movie had premiered- and new figures have shown that the controversial film may have influenced a dramatic increase in sales of adult toys sold in the country.

A 30% increase in sales volumes at online adult stores was recorded in the week following the film's release on Valentine's Day, with Melbourne topping the list as Australia's friskiest capital city, taking 44% of the very special deliveries.

Alexandra Lewis, 35, owns and operates Andracova, a Melbourne-based online adult store specialising in female orientated products to encourage and empower women.

Ms Lewis said that her store experienced a significant spike in sales following the release of the film, and that she believes the figures reflect a greater openness in discussing female pleasure.

'The 50 Shades of Grey books and film are a good highlighter of a cultural trend, whether you think they're brilliant or a grammatical error,' said Ms Lewis.

'It has opened the door to a female discussion on pleasure and intimacy for women, one that they haven't finished having yet,' she said.

'There has definitely been an increase in the target market who are thinking about the products and it has also created a broader market of people considering trying something new for the first time.'

'Andracova has seen a spike in sales of entry-level products and it seems like there is more openness to experimentation,' Ms Lewis said

Average sales volumes increased to a staggering 46% in the six months leading up to the movie’s release

eWAY, who power more than 17,000 Aussie online stores, recorded daily average sales volumes  increasing steadily to a staggering 46% in the six months leading up to the movie’s release, with a notable spike occurring in February.

'Andracova has seen a spike in sales of entry-level products and it seems like there is more openness to experimentation,' Ms Lewis said.

The online adult store released a Fifty Shades of Grey tie-in pack, featuring hand cuffs, a whip, a blindfold, and a collar and chain set.

'Especially in terms of BDSM products, we stock light bondage items such as small whips, bondage tape and beginners handcuffs, and there has definitely been an increase in the sale of those,' Ms Lewis said.

Ms Lewis said there had been an increase in beginner level adult toy sales

'There seems to be a changing philosophy that is very female orientated and products are now being marketed towards women rather than men,' she said.

'It's a great time to encourage people to look at products for the first time, and the website traffic shows that more and more people are dipping their finger into the pie'. 

Melbourne represented 44% of the adult toy sales, with Sydney comprising 24% of sales, with Perth, Brisbane, and Adelaide making up the rest of the sales.

Ms Lewis said that Melbourne may represent a greater proportion of sales as there is a strong community of eroticism around the city.

'We have a lot of great stores and vibrant erotic events held around Melbourne,' she said.

'We are definitely happy to try something new.'  

eWAY’s Matt Bullock said that February has been a high-performing month for the broader category, with florists experiencing 110 per cent increases in sales in two weeks leading up to Valentine’s day, too.

'Sometimes contextual events influence online sales in ways that might surprise you,' he said.

'There is a shift to online retailing in general in Australia anyway — we’ve seen a 35 per cent increase in overall sales in the past 12 months. But clearly with categories like this there is added appeal for shoppers to go online, as it’s a bit more discreet.'
