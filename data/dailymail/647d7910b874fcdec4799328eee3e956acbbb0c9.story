Demanding: Queen Noor of Jordan, pictured here in 2009, is alleged to treated her head gardener unfairly

As one of the world’s wealthiest women, it may be rare for Queen Noor of Jordan to hear the word ‘No’.

But some things are impossible, even for a queen, and growing mangoes in the cold climes of Britain surely falls into that category.

That is the demand she is alleged to have made of the head gardener at her lavish Berkshire estate, Amanda Hill, who claims it was part of a culture of bullying that forced her to quit her job.

Mrs Hill, 52, told a tribunal yesterday that Queen Noor bombarded her with ‘impossible’ requests – and said she was threatened by estate manager Caroline Migdadi when she was unable to fulfil them.

She claims one such demand was when she was asked to grow mangoes and avocados in the garden at Buckhurst Park, Windsor, even though they can survive only in warm climates.

She added: ‘When I pointed out that it is not possible to grow these fruits in the UK Mrs Migdadi informed me in a threatening manner, “Do you want to tell that to Her Majesty Queen Noor?”’

Mrs Hill claims she was even called back from holiday early on another occasion just because one of the queen’s daughters wanted to know the names of herbs.

When she arrived at the estate, she discovered the daughter – Princess Raiyah – was not even in, but was made to carry out other menial tasks anyway.

The claims form part of a constructive dismissal and sex discrimination case at Reading Employment Tribunal against Ambassador Marine Corporation, her employer.

Mrs Hill’s witness statement reads: ‘I would never have imagined anything like this happening to me ever and it has caused me a great deal of pain and heartache.

‘All I wanted was to be treated fairly and with respect and dignity. During this period of time the majority of employees at Buckhurst Park have left.

‘There had become a culture of bullying and harassment and I feel sorry to have to say this and be here today.’

The gardener, from nearby Ascot, quit her £18,500-a-year job in January last year after a groundsman on the same salary, Daniel Welland, was given a pay increase to £22,500 but she was refused the same.

She told the tribunal he gradually took over her responsibilities and she was told he was better for garden work ‘because he was a man, he was stronger’.

Mrs Hill said that when she complained, Queen Noor, 60, ‘then began to criticise the gardens even though the week before she had praised me on how wonderful the gardens looked’.

She added: ‘I was told off about the ivy on the perimeter fence of the estate, how badly the roses had been pruned and the amount of weeds we had.’

Mrs Hill began work at the 60-acre estate in 1996 and was promoted to head gardener in 2006.

Her job was to maintain the gardens, orchards, woodlands and lakes for Queen Noor, who stays at the mansion for several months every year when not in the Middle East.

In July 2010, Mrs Hill wrote to the queen’s PA to ask for a pay rise for both herself and Mr Welland. However, only Mr Welland got the extra money – and was promoted to head groundsman.

Mrs Hill said she was excluded from meetings and recruitment procedures, told off in front of student interns and ignored when giving advice on tending roses and wisteria.

The tribunal heard she was also kicked out of her office, with bin bags of her folders left outside.

Queen Noor is the widow of King Hussein of Jordan, who died in 1999. Born Lisa Najeeb Halaby in the US, she has a degree in architecture and urban planning from the American university of Princeton.

She worked on building projects all over the world before renouncing her US citizenship and marrying King Hussein in 1978.

She was his fourth and last wife, and the couple had four children, Princes Hamzah and Hashim and Princesses Iman and Raiyah.

After her husband’s death, Buckhurst Park was told to cut down on spending – but it is understood she still has access to considerable wealth. She chairs the Noor Al Hussein Foundation, an anti-poverty charity, and has spoken out in favour of peace between Western nations and the Middle East.

Jordan is currently ruled by one of King Hussein’s children from his three previous marriages, King Abdullah II, and his wife Queen Rania.

The hearing continues.
