A New Jersey house which burned down killing five residents did not have working fire alarms, it was claimed yesterday.

A grandmother and four children died in the blaze on Thursday morning, which four other family members managed to escape.

The mayor of South Plainfield said a fire service investigation had determined that the house's smoke alarms were not working properly.

However, the family's landlord has insisted he installed proper file alarms and they were working when he last checked them in October.

Tragic: Tyler Davis, seven, and a boy believed to be his brother Elijah Taylor, were among the five people who died in the raging house fire in South Plainfield, New Jersey

Perished: Their sister, Alizae, 12, was also killed into the two-family home when the blaze erupted in the early hours of this morning

Grandmother: Ann Jefferson, 62, was also trapped inside, with no way for firefighters to reach her

Ann Jefferson, 62, and her 
grandchildren, 12-year-old Alizae, seven-year-old Tyler Davis, 
two-year-old Elijah Taylor, and a boy, Chris, believed to be age five or
 six, perished in the blaze.

Another
 baby girl, two-year-old Angel Taylor, was reportedly saved when her 
teenage brother ran out of the burning home carrying her in his arms.

Fifteen-year-old
 Shaquan Phillips apparently tried to return inside to rescue other 
family members, but was stopped by firefighters.

A neighbour said he heard the 
teenager desperately shouting 'Come out, come out, get out of the 
house!' after the fire broke out.

Jordan Taylor, eight, was said to be 
in critical condition in a hospital's burns unit after escaping the 
house with his mother, Natalie Jefferson, but the other three survivors 
have now left hospital.

Burnt out: A fire at this house in South Plainfield, New Jersey killed five members of the family

Destruction: The 130-year-old converted farmhouse was heavily damaged by the fatal blaze

Aftermath: Four other family members survived the fire, but an eight-year-old boy is in a critical condition

Raging: The fire was so extensive that emergency services had serious difficulty entering the house

The fire started at 3am on Thursday in the converted farmhouse, which is designed to hold two families.

When
 firefighters arrived at the scene, they had serious difficulty gaining 
entry either to the first or second floor because of the extraordinary 
volume of flames and smoke.

'There was just so much heat and fire,' South Plainfield's deputy fire chief told the Star-Ledger.

Neighbour Isabel Scavino said her husband woke up to the sound of a screaming child, and the couple then heard what sounded like either gunshots or firecrackers.

Ms Scavino said she saw a woman running from the home with several children, and a small child in her arms.

'The fire just spread out, it was just crazy. It looked like it started on the first floor and then just spread up to the roof in about a minute,' she said.

Response: A teenager's attempts to save his siblings were barred by firefighters while the fire raged

Scene: The large house was apparently designed to hold two families

Authorities said that 
there were five casualties, all found on the second floor of the house, 
but were unable to confirm their identities.

However,
 a relative of the family told the Star-Ledger that the woman killed was
 62-year-old Ann Jefferson, and the four children - aged two to 11 - 
were her grandchildren.

One firefighter described his colleagues' agony at being unable to rescue the five victims, saying: 'Itâ€™s a very trying time.'

Middlesex County Prosecutor Bruce Kaplan said authorities were working to confirm the identities of the victims and the causes of death.

He said police and the prosecutor's office were investigating the cause of the fire.

Two volunteer firefighters received minor injuries when they were involved in a two-vehicle crash en route to the fire.
