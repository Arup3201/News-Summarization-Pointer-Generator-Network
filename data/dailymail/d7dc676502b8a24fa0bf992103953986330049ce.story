Expensive taste: Son of Equatorial Guinea's president, Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, wearing a shirt emblazoned with his father's face, has reportedly spent $70million of his country's money

He lives a typical Malibu playboy lifestyle - residing in a sprawling beach mansion, has dated rapper Eve and even splashed out $3million on Michael Jackson memorabilia. 

But now Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue is set to lose it all after it was revealed that the son of Equatorial Guinea's president is being hunted by the U.S. government for looting more than $70million from his own country.

Mangue, 39, used his position as a government minister to siphon millions of dollars for personal use, according to two civil forfeiture complaints filed in Los Angeles and Washington D.C.

As part of an international collaboration to retrieve his fortune, the U.S. government is now trying to recover the $70million.

U.S. authorities believe the son of President Teodoro Obiang Nguema amassed more than 
$100million in various schemes while he served as the country's 
forestry minister.

Among them were demanding companies pay a 'tax' 
for doing business in Equatorial Guinea as well as providing Mangue with
 gifts and free services, according to court documents filed in the U.S.

In what appeared to be a concerted action, France last month seized 11 luxury sports cars belonging to him and a Spanish investigative judge has been asked to seize properties in Madrid and Las Palmas in the Canary Islands owned by the president, his sons and ministers.

Equatorial Guinea is a country of around
 680,000 people which has become a major oil, gas and timber producer, 
resulting in billions of dollars in revenue. Despite this fact, the majority of the population live on a dollar a day.

And despite already having a government 
salary of $6,800 a month, Mangue is accused of tapping into the nation's 
wealth and indulging his lavish tastes.

Mangue, who is American-educated, spent $30million on a Malibu 
mansion, $38.5million on a Gulfstream jet and $3.2million on 
Michael Jackson memorabilia that included a crystal-covered glove from 
the Bad tour and a basketball signed by the singer and Michael Jordan.

Among the other items purchased by Mangue, according to federal officials, was a 2011 Ferrari  
valued at more than $530,000.

He also stored 24 luxury cars worth 
nearly $10million at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles and 
shipped them to France, which has reportedly since seized 11 of them.

Last year it was reported that Mangue was dating the rapper and actress Eve, spending close
 to $700,000 to rent Microsoft billionaire Paul Allen's 303-foot yacht 
Tatoosh to impress her, according to the New York Post.

A friend of Eve told the New York 
tabloid that he had been chasing her for a long time and that she 
finally gave in to his invitation.

The Grammy award winner was reportedly named in the ongoing investigation into Mangue and  foreign corruption.

Eve used her Twitter account to deny the allegations and urged her fans not to believe everything they read.

Authorities are seeking to 
recover $70million in stolen funds from Mangue for 'the benefit of the 
people of the country from which it was taken'.

Assistant Attorney General 
Lanny Breuer said: 'We are sending the message loud and 
clear: The United States will not be a hiding place for the ill-gotten 
riches of the world's corrupt leaders.'

An email message left for Purificacion Angue Ondo, Equatorial Guinea's ambassador to the U.S., was not immediately returned.

Mangue would give various stories to banks that questioned his large sums of cash, authorities said.

When Nguema opened an account at a California bank in 2007, he claimed that he acquired money from a family inheritance along with trading expensive, custom-made cars.

His father, who has led Equatorial Guinea since 1979, has been 
accused by Amnesty International of torturing and unjustly imprisoning 
political opponents.

The U.S. Senate Permanent 
Subcommittee on Investigations issued reports in 2004 and last year 
regarding possible corruption by Equatorial Guinea government officials.

The 2010 report found that powerful 
foreign officials and their families used attorneys, real estate agents 
and lobbyists to circumvent anti-corruption laws.

In the two civil forfeiture complaints, it is stated that Mangue's assets can be 
forfeited because he engaged in misappropriation and theft of public 
funds for his benefit.

Poverty: Malabo neighbourhood in Equatorial Guinea stands in contrast to President Mbasogo's riches

Equatorial Guinea was a relatively ignored place until American energy company Exxon Mobil discovered oil and gas there in 1994.

U.S. companies continue to dominate the industry there but face growing competition. Most oil from the country, which produces billions of dollars in annual revenue, is exported to America.

Despite its newfound wealth, life for the vast majority of the country's 680,000 people remains a struggle.

The majority live below the poverty line with tens of thousands having no access to electricity or clean water.

It was listed by U.S. think tank Freedom House as among one of the world's worst regimes along with North Korea, Burma and Somalia.

President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo seized power in 1979 from his uncle, who said he was a sorcerer and collected human skulls.

The President has created a one-party state in a country with Africa's most notorious prison, Black Beach, which is known for its torture.
