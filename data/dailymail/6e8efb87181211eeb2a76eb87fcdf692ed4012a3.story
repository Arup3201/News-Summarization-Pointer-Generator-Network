Lack of confidence: Labour leader Ed Miliband

Fewer than half of Labour supporters want to see Ed Miliband lead the party into the next election, according to a devastating poll last night.

Just 46 per cent of those who voted Labour in 2010 said they would like to see him still in post in two years' time.

Thirty-four per cent said he should go, with the rest saying they were undecided.

The humiliating ICM poll, published in the Daily Mirror, will further add to pressure on the beleaguered Labour leader, who has been accused of allowing the Coalition parties to snatch the political initiative during the summer political recess.

Last night Labour MP Tom Harris accused his party's leadership of spending too much time obsessing about policies designed to impress 'tofu eaters' rather than ordinary voters.

The ICM poll showed that across all voters, just 26 per cent want Mr Miliband to continue leading the party, with 40 per cent saying he should go.

Only 21 per cent of voters say they are satisfied with Mr Miliband's performance, but even Labour supporters are not impressed.

Less than half of those who voted for the party in 2010 - 45 per cent - are satisfied with him. Some 31 per cent are dissatisfied.

The poll does at least show that Mr Miliband has more backing than anyone else - including his brother - to be Labour leader.

But he trails David Cameron on several aspects of leadership including 'tough decisions', running the economy and foreign affairs - but beats him on honesty and 'being in touch'.

Yesterday Glasgow South MP Tom Harris launched an attack on the Labour leadership, singling out for criticism the plan to bring in votes for 16 year olds, announced at the weekend by the party's justice spokesman Sadiq Khan.

He suggested that Labour should be taking its cue from issues in its mailbag, not middle-class dinner party goers.

Writing for the Telegraph, he said: 'It may well be that when Sadiq Khan opens his mail in the morning, almost all his correspondents are demanding that a priority of the next Labour government must be to lower the voting age to 16. After all, what else would they have to complain about in Tooting?

On BBC Radio 4's Today programme David Blunkett, senior minister throughout the Blair-Brown years, explained what Labour - and Ed Miliband - needs to do to rally support.

He defended the beleaguered leader by saying that public opinion fluctuated, arguing that the poll's depended on 'what month you take it'.

'Not a few months ago he was being praised for tackling issues and his conference speech,' Mr Blunkett said.

'The worst job in politics is leader of the opposition.'

He said that Labour now had some strong policies after its disaster at the voting polls.

'We lost a large number of elections before we got our act together,' he said.

He claimed the real challenge for Labour now was not it's leader or the people in the party, but making sure the public had an idea of what its policies were and eradicating the idea that Labour was responsible for a slew of problems.

He accused the coalition government of developing since 2010 'a clever mantra that everything that was wrong was down to Labour - we need to get out of this perspective that we were to blame.

'... we should be proud of what we did and learn from our mistakes.'

He said the government needed to get a 'hearing' about what it had achieved, and what its policies are in time for the 2015 election.

He said: 'We need to work out how to get a higher profile in circumstances that make it hard to get a hearing.

'We need to be clear and make sure we join our policies up so they are linked and people can see what the party wants and looks like.'

'But in 12 years representing Glasgow South, I've received precisely no requests from constituents - including younger ones who might actually benefit - to support such a move.

'And when I've been given the chance to ask classrooms of teenagers what they think of the idea, they've generally been apathetic or opposed.'

Mr Harris said that people the policy was labelled 'progressive', those who opposed votes at 16 were caricatured as 'nasty reactionaries who hate young people', when in fact he just wasn't impressed with a policy whose justification goes no further than 'It will engage young people'.

He said the Labour leadership seemed to be more interested in persuading the Lib Dems to enter into a post-2015 coalition than in garnering support among the people.

'Votes at 16 isn't being demanded by anyone, least of all 16-year-olds who, oddly, have more important things to do with their time than worry about who to vote for. Teenagers, eh? Tch!

'But it's exactly the kind of middle-class dinner party issue that tofu eaters throughout the country get really excited about. And that certainly includes Nick Clegg's minions. Not for them the irritating and, frankly, dull issues of employment and the cost of living.

'If Labour is starting to move away from talking about real-life issues to talking instead about irrelevant, niche subjects that will imprss and affect nobody, then that's sending a very clear message to the Lib Dems: you can do business with us.'

Mr Miliband did at least get some backing yesterday - from Ken Livingstone.

The lefty former London mayor launched a scathing attack on Lord Prescott after he criticised Labour's summer performance, and told the peer: 'You screwed it up - don't try and wreck it for others.'

He urged Mr Miliband to ignore Lord Prescott, saying: 'For Prescott to criticise anyone else given his record in government is just ridiculous. The last thing Ed Miliband needs to do is take advice from him.'

Mr Livingstone hailed Mr Miliband as a 'the most impressive Labour leader' since John Smith.

'He is a genuine Labour leader. He is not obsessed by short-term trivia, he is thinking about how Britain should be in 25 years' time,' he added.
