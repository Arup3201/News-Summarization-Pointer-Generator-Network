Arsenal are moving to safeguard the future of their key stars, with Per Mertesacker and Tomas Rosicky signing new contracts.

And the club have plans to put Aaron Ramsey, Laurent Koscielny and Santi Cazorla on improved deals.

Having spent £42million on Mesut Ozil in the summer, Sportsmail revealed last year how the Gunners would turn their attention to keeping  current members of the squad.

Staying put: Rosicky and Mertesacker have extended their deals at the Emirates

Wojciech Szczesny, who penned a new 
deal last year, Bacary Sagna, Mertesacker and Rosicky were viewed as the
 club’s priority — and three of the four have signed.

Rosicky has signed a 12-month deal, with an option for a further year, keeping him on £80,000  per week.

Germany
 defender Mertesacker, who is a contender to become Arsenal skipper 
should out-of-favour Thomas Vermaelen leave this summer, is understood 
to have signed a three-and-a-half year deal, taking him to 2017.

His new contract includes a  marginal pay-rise from £80,000 per week.

Securing the future of Sagna, however, is proving less straightforward, with the right back already rejecting two offers.

The Gunners will now look to extend Ramsey, Koscielny and Cazorla’s contracts.

Not bad! Wenger has done well in securing the long-term services of some of his top players

Ramsey,
 targeting the clash against Tottenham on March 16 for his return from a
 thigh injury, signed a new  contract worth £50,000 a week in December 
2012.

But his form this season has forced Gunners chiefs into action, with talks over  a five-year contract under way.

The
 new deal would give the Wales midfielder a  significant pay rise and 
the club hierarchy are confident of a  successful conclusion.

Likewise, Koscielny’s excellent displays have enhanced the France defender’s reputation in Europe.

And
 with Manchester City  and Barcelona on the look out for a new centre 
back, the Gunners plan to quickly improve the  28-year-old’s deal.

Koscielny
 still has three-and-a-half years left on his £55,000-per-week agreement 
but he will be in line for a significant increase as  the Gunners look 
to secure him for the long term.

As Sportsmail reported last week, the Gunners are also trying to tie Spaniard Cazorla to a  contract extension.

Meanwhile, midfielder Kim Kallstrom has stepped up his training schedule following a back injury.Kallstrom,
 31, joined Arsenal on loan from Spartak Moscow in January despite 
having a  fractured vertebrae and there were fears he may never play  
for the club.

But the Sweden midfielder has intensified  his workload at the club’s London Colney HQ and is nearing match fitness.

Denmark striker Nicklas Bendtner insists he will  continue to give his all for the club despite being set to leave this summer.

He
 said: ‘I don’t think I have ever pulled my socks down and been like, 
“F*** this, I don’t care”, but I have played like I had a future and I 
am going to continue doing that until the end of the season, then we 
might part ways.’
