Receiving a bouquet of flowers at work is one of the top five most desired gestures

Surprises may be the key to everyday happiness, according to new research.

Two thirds (64 per cent) of Britons say thoughtful gestures make their day.

And more than half (51 per cent) say that when someone does something nice for them, it makes them feel loved.

The nation's top five surprises include being cooked for, being made a cup of tea and a surprise note or letter left under a pillow. 

More than two fifths (43 per cent) believe it puts them in a good mood for hours, and a quarter of us (27 per cent) say it has a 'pass it on' effect on us. 

We feel the urge to do something good and make a surprise gesture for someone else as a result. 

Even just a surprise mug of tea can evoke the same feelings of positivity and happiness as a grand gesture like an extravagant gift.

Eight in ten (81 per cent) of the population say they would feel just as pleased with a warm cup of tea.

Professor Neil Frude, consultant clinical psychologist at The Happiness Consultancy.co.uk, commented on the findings.

'Psychologists have studied the positive effect of pleasant surprises for many years,' he said.

'What they have found is that when something delightful and unexpected happens it gives people a real boost.

'Pleasant surprises have a biological effect, a psychological effect and a social effect. 

'And because emotional states are contagious, when a surprise makes someone happy then their friends, family and colleagues also benefit, so a surprise for one person really can 'spread a little happiness'.'

The survey also revealed that we're a generous nation.

More than three quarters of people (77 per cent) have received a surprise in the last six months, with the majority coming from romantic partners.

Furthermore, two thirds (65 per cent) have performed a spontaneous gesture for someone 'just because' during the last month, proving you don't have to wait for an occasion to give a special surprise. 

Someone completing a household chore before you come home from work is also popular

1) Someone cooking a surprise meal when I get home from work (24 per cent)

2) Being made an unexpected cup of tea on a bad day (17 per cent)

3) A surprise note or letter tucked into a bag, or under a pillow (16 per cent)

4) Someone completing a household chore for me before I come home from work (15 per cent)

5) Receiving a bouquet of flowers at work (11 per cent)

When it comes to giving, 45 per cent said that performing a spontaneous gesture for someone makes them feel good with a further 40 per cent saying it makes them feel like they have done their good deed for the day. 

Nearly half (45 per cent) of people also said they felt happier giving treats rather than receiving them (12 per cent).

However, it's not all good news. 

One in five (20 per cent) admit a lack of desire to take part in any spontaneous gestures, so it comes as no surprise that a third of us believe nice gestures are on the decline compared to a decade ago. 

The majority of people attribute this decline to the pressure people feel to spend money on expensive gestures, a lack of time and laziness.

The survey of over 2,000 people comes as the world's largest flower delivery network, Interflora, launches a partnership with ITV's Surprise Surprise, which will see Mark Wright hand deliver  bouquets to deserving loved ones across the UK from October 22.

The Surprise Someone Special campaign gives people the chance to recommend a friend or family member to receive a surprise visit from Mark and be presented with an Interflora bouquet by visiting www.interflora.co.uk/surprise during September.
