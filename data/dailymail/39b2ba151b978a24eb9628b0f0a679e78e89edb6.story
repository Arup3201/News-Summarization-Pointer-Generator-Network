Popular: Nigel Evans at Westminster where he has been a leading social light for more than a decade

The news of Nigel Evans’s arrest will come as a shock to fellow MPs, who know him as an ebullient, sociable figure who is popular on both sides of the House of Commons.

Mr Evans, who has been MP for Ribble Valley since 1992 and Deputy Speaker of the  Commons since 2010, is a regular fixture in Commons bars and at society events.

But he is also widely admired for the way in which he came out about his homosexuality in an article for The Mail on Sunday in 2010.

After years of Westminster gossip about his private life, Mr Evans said he was fed up with ‘living a lie’ – and revealed that he had even received threats of blackmail from political enemies over his sexuality.

‘With my background in South Wales, it was hard enough being a Tory, let alone being gay,’ he said. ‘It wasn’t so much “the only gay in the village” as the “only Tory in Swansea”.’

Mr Evans, who has never been married, added: ‘After decades of denying it to myself, and then just denying it to others, I didn’t want to continue living a fraction of my life.’

He said he had made the final decision to tell the truth when Tory MP and Energy Minister Greg Barker – who left his wife for a gay lover – approached him.

‘Greg came up to me and said, “I’m doing a list of the most powerful gay politicians, do I include you?” I thought, this is just daft. I am not going to live a lie any more.

‘The reaction was, mostly, incredibly supportive.

‘A handful of letters spoke more loudly of the sender than the recipient. My staff shielded me from the worst examples of intolerance, bile and hatred.

‘Their message contained not a scintilla of understanding or know-ledge of the open and hidden battles that so many people face in their daily lives.

‘There are the many youngsters who are constantly bullied at school or work because people know or suspect that they are gay. The relentless harassment destroys their lives and in some cases ends tragically in suicide.’

Born in Swansea in 1957, Mr Evans was educated at Dynevor School, a grammar which converted to a comprehensive during his time there.

After studying for a politics degree at Swansea University, Mr Evans started his working life helping out at his family’s newsagents shops, before embarking on his political career as a local councillor.

He was defeated in three Commons Elections in the space of one Parliamentary term – Swansea West at the 1987 General Election, at the Pontypridd by-election in 1989 and the Ribble Valley by-election in 1991 – before finally taking his current seat at the 1992 Election.

‘After decades of denying it to myself, 
and then just denying it to others, I didn’t want to continue living a 
fraction of my life.’

He was quickly talent-spotted by William Hague who made him his Parliamentary Private Secretary in 1996, when Mr Hague was Welsh Secretary.

Mr Evans was briefly a party frontbencher when he served as Shadow Welsh Secretary under Iain Duncan Smith between 2001 and 2003, returning to the backbenches after Michael Howard took over the Tory leadership.

Since becoming Deputy Speaker, after the 2010 Election, he has impressed colleagues with his handling of Commons debates: his good-humoured approach is preferred by many MPs to John Bercow’s more abrasive style.

Some said Mr Evans was in prime position to succeed Mr Bercow when he stands down.

Last month, Mr Evans made clear his respect for Margaret Thatcher by mounting a strong defence of the cost of the funeral arrangements for the former Prime Minister.

He rebuked the Bishop of Grantham for suggesting the event could be a focus for ugly protests, insisting Britain excelled at ‘pomp and ceremony’.

He also heaped praise on Lady Thatcher’s granddaughter Amanda for her calm and collected reading at the funeral in St Paul’s.

Mr Evans said: ‘If she had been speaking at just a family funeral people can break down and cry, but her composure was perfect.’

Mr Evans told movingly in 2009 how his mother Betty died from a superbug infection after a routine operation in an NHS hospital, writing: ‘The last, harrowing moments of my mother’s life will live for ever in the collective memory of my family.

'An 86-year-old lady of infinite grace and dignity, she had the most agonising of deaths.’

He blamed the tragedy on a ‘mixture of neglect, incompetence and indifference shown by the NHS’ before adding: ‘If she had been cared for properly, if the ward had been cleaner or greater urgency had been shown in handling her case, then this tragedy might never have happened.’

Mr Evans – who enjoys regular foreign trips as part of his duties – made a characteristic appearance in the gossip columns two years ago when involved in a good-humoured, late-night exchange with police after pulling up to the Commons gates in a tourist rickshaw.

He made a futile attempt to persuade them to waive security rules so he could ride on to the  Parliamentary estate to collect the driver’s fare.

He was last spotted at the Commons on Thursday evening, cheerfully waving to colleagues as he loaded up his Saab convertible before driving to his constituency.
