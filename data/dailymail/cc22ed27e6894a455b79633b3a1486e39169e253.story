The High Street took a battering yesterday as a host of retailers announced they will be closing stores and with 10,000 jobs facing the axe.

Chocolate chain Thorntons said 120 poorly performing shops face the closure while Britain’s biggest floor coverings firm, Carpetright, announced plans to shut 75 outlets, placing up to 200 jobs at risk.

The clothing chain TJ Hughes – a Liverpool institution – said it is looking to appoint an administrator, placing 4,000 full and part time jobs in jeopardy at its 57 stores nationwide.

Jane Norman, the women’s fashion chain which called in the administrators at the start of the week, announced 33 stores will shut as it made 400 staff redundant.

The gloomy news will transform the fabric of the High Street, as well-known names pull down the shutters on their stores.

Retailers are falling victim to plunging consumer confidence across the country.

At the tills this translates into hard-up shoppers preserving their cash for all but the most essential of items.

It comes as new figures released 
yesterday showed a big slump in household savings in the first three 
months of the year as families struggle to keep up with rising prices.

The Office of National Statistics yesterday said stagnant wages meant the savings ratio -
the money they have left to tuck away after paying bills - fell from 
5.1 per cent to 4.6 per cent over the three months to March.

At the same time, households - while paying more - are actually buying fewer goods and services.

The amount bought 
in those months fell by 0.6 per cent - the largest decline since the 
depths of the recession in the spring of 2009, according to the Office 
of National Statistics.

The
ONS revealed the volume of products and services bought has taken its 
biggest fall since the depths of the Great Recession but the amount 
spent has risen.

Homeform, the owner of Moben kitchens, bathroom chain Dolphin and Sharps bedrooms, said last week it intended to appoint administrators, putting 1,300 jobs at risk, while Comet owner Kesa said it was considering selling the electricals retailer after it posted losses of £8.9million.

At Thorntons more than 700 jobs are at risk following months of falling sales for the Derbyshire-based confectioner.

The company has issued several profit warnings, blaming everything from hot weather to arctic conditions for shoppers avoiding its 599 stores.

But the firm has also suffered from a strategy focused on just two key periods during the year – Christmas and Easter.

Chief executive Jonathan Hart said: ‘Our objective is to encourage existing customers to visit and purchase more frequently.

‘While Thorntons will always be strongly associated with key selling seasons, we will grow the relevance of other all year round gifting occasions.’

The problems are likely to fan flames on the debate over the coalition government's spending cuts.

Labour is lobbying for a cut in VAT payments to help shops battling spiralling rent bills and bring relief to consumers.

Habitat:Thirty
stores outside London put into administration. Around 900 jobs 
threatened. Homebase and Argos owner, Home Retail Group, bought the 
rights to the Habitat brand in the UK, the website and three stores in 
central London for £24.5million.

HomeForm:

About
3,000 jobs at risk across 160 showrooms, including 1,500 fitters and 
designers. The private equity owned business is behind Moben kitchens, 
bathroom chain Dolphin and Sharps bedrooms. Administrators were called 
in last week.

All Saints:Fashion
chain on the brink of administration until Lion Capital stepped in. 
Lion owns La Senza and American Apparel and the deal secures hundreds of 
jobs in 63 stores and 47 concessions in the UK, Europe, US and Russia. 
Badly affected by Icelandic banking crisis as Glitnir and Kaupthing held
significant stakes.

Focus DIY:Ernst
& Young launched a closing down sale in May as it moved to shut 123
stores out of the company's 178-strong store estate. The administrator 
earlier managed to find buyers for 55 stores, including to Wickes owner 
Travis Perkins, but the collapse of the chain left more than 3,000 
workers facing redundancy.

Oddbins:The
wine merchant was the latest victim of a declining independent wine 
trade in the UK, which also saw Threshers' owner, First Quench 
Retailing, collapse in 2009. Oddbins had hoped to push through a rescue 
deal but HM Revenues & Customs, which was owed £8 million by the 
chain, refused to vote for the scheme. Whittals Wine Merchants bought 37
Oddbins stores, securing more than 200 store jobs, but this left a 
further 52 stores in the hands of administrators Deloitte.

JJB Sports:The
sportswear chain was saved from administration after landlords and 
creditors backed its second rescue deal in as many years. JJB's latest 
company voluntary arrangement involved closing 43 unprofitable stores, 
placing a further 46 under review and a move to monthly rental payments.
The deal enabled it to raise £65 million from investors and secure a 
new banking facility.

HMV:The
sale of its Waterstone's book chain for £53 million has been key to 
HMV's survival as the deal with Russian investor Alexander Mamut enabled
the high street retailer to negotiate a two-year extension to lending 
facilities with its banks. HMV, which has around 260 stores in the UK 
and Ireland, is now working on a plan to reduce its estate and focus 
more on gadgets such as iPads.

Mothercare:Mothercare
unveiled plans in May to close 110 outlets and focus on out-of-town 
superstores. Rents will be cut on a further 40 stores, squeezing incomes
for high street landlords even further. The new focus will be on 
out-of-town Parenting Centres, which contain its Early Learning Centre 
brand.

Maureen Hinton, senior retail analyst
at Verdict Research, told the Guardian: 'It feels every bit as bad as 
at the height of the credit crunch when Woolworths collapsed. We are 
going through a retrenchment that is probably as severe as we have seen 
since the war.'

She said 
supply was outstripping demand and weak operators were at risk of 
collapsing. Industry experts said the British retail sector had reached 
'saturation point.'

Businesses selling stationary or kitchenware or those which have not diversified are said to be at risk.
