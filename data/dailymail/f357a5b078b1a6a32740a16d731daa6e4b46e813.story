Most of us are probably a bit fed up of hearing about selfies by now - but let's face it, the majority still like to snap and post them.

They have taken over the world of social media with people all over the globe – including world leaders President Obama, Danish prime minister Helle-Thorning Schmidt and prime minister David Cameron – getting in on the action.

The invention of the front-facing phone camera means that we can now take our selfies with a clear view of our lovely faces, without any awkward fumbling.

Mirror, mirror: The underwear set and iPhone case are both printed with text in reverse for an uber-fashionalble statement selfie

However, the mirror selfie is just as 
important, of course, to allow a full-length self-portrait, and now one 
designer is making mirror selfies more fashionable than ever.

Russian designer Tigran Ayetisyan has created an Underwear Selfie Set, decorated with writing printed in reverse, meaning it appears the right way around in the mirror.

Designed exclusively for SHOWstudio, the underwear selfie set is made for comfort (as well as selfie-kudos) from grey tracksuit material emblazoned with two blurred stripes in black and white, with matching tops and bottoms.

Printed in black-and-white, the set’s mirror image slogan reads ‘Us and Them’ across the wearer’s collarbone and around the elastic band of the bottoms.

Us and Them: The collection's slogan was inspired by the role fashion has in creating division while also bringing people together

And to complete your perfect selfie, Tigran's capsule collection for SHOWstudio also includes a mirror image the set also includes ab iphone case with the word 'censored'.

Moscow-based Tigran graduated from Central Saint Martins in 2012, and his previous collections have drawn on the hardship of student life.

When choosing the 'Us and Them' slogan, Tigran said: 'I was thinking about the role fashion has in creating division between people whilst at the same time bringing certain groups together'

Say selfie! The selfie iPhone case, on sale for £25, adds the finishing touch to your mirror moment

Each set is painted by hand, meaning your selfie underwear will be as unique as your photo, although it's only available in one size.

With a price tag of £250, the outfit really is a true test of just how selfie-obsessed you are.
