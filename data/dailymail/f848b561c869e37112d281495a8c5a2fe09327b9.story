MailOnline Sport last week launched a mini-series of Football Friday Google+ Hangouts with Neil Ashton leading the debate as the Barclays Premier League reaches its thrilling climax.

Sportsmail's Martin Keown and Ian Ladyman believe the wind has been taken out of Wigan's sales ahead of tomorrow's FA Cup final against Manchester City after Roberto Martinez's side were beaten by Swansea in midweek.

Martin Keown, who has won the competition three times, said: 'Psychologically that defeat was a major blow coming into the Cup final. Roberto Martinez has a great chance to win something tomorrow but Manchester City look pretty dominant at the moment.'

Watch the below video to see what the fans joining Martin and Ian think of the Cup final and Sir Alex Ferguson's decision to step down after 27 years at Manchester United..

Tune in and watch the debate from the home of football this morning.

Ian Ladyman agrees with Martin after watching Wigan slump to a 3-2 defeat at the DW.

He said: 'Tuesday night was a big game for them, if they'd have won it they'd have had a good chance tomorrow.

'But I have to say they were poor on Tuesday, they looked nervous and they made mistakes.

'There was a huge feeling of deflation around the DW and I think they may bring some of that here.'

The pair then moved on to the story of the week: Sir Alex Ferguson's decision to step down at Old Trafford and the subsequent appointment of David Moyes.

Martin believes that other clubs will think United are there for the taking, but noted that Moyes should not be underestimated.

He said: 'David Moyes is an outstanding candidate for this job.

'But their opponents will see it as a chance without that great man at the helm.

'But David Moyes will be expecting to continue in the same vain.

He added: 'David Moyes is the right candidate. There is a lack of European experience but I feel he is quite a pragmatic manager, he's a thoroughly nice guy and he loves football.

In the January of 2002 I was 
despatched from London to Manchester to cover the final few months of 
Sir Alex Ferguson’s reign at Manchester United. Little did anybody know 
back then that I – like everybody else – would have to wait more than a 
decade to do it.

'He's a student of the game but he has got to hit the ground running because the pressure will be on him if he doesn't.

'I expect them to continue that success that they have but I feel it is an opportunity to wrestle the dominance away from United.'

Ian Ladyman has been covering Manchester United for a number of years, and offered a fascinating insight into Sir Alex Ferguson's relationship with the press.

Ian said: 'It was an enormous challenge every day. You never really knew what you were going to get. Whether he was going to be the grumpy, surly figure looking for a fight or whether it was the other side, amusing, entertaining, intelligent side.

'You never knew what you were going to get. He didn't like cowards, but equally, if you stood up to him too much, he thought you were rude.'
