It’s a struggle to feed a family on a tight budget.

Soaring food prices have put added pressure on cash-strapped families with some resorting to cheap processed food and failing to eat enough fruit and vegetables. 

But it is possible to tasty, nutritious meals without breaking the bank.

On a tight budget? It's not that difficult to feed your family well if you plan all your meals and take advantage of special deals and offers

Tecso's spring chicken casserole has courgettes, tomatoes and butter beans and costs just £3.85 to make 

All you need to to do is budget judiciously and shop wisely. And while it will take time and some organisational skills, it can be very rewarding.

Do your grocery shop towards the end of the day when supermarkets start to fill up their discount shelves with food that will be going off in a days' time. 

It's also always worth planning exactly what you are going to cook and buying the right amount of ingredients for that meal. 

Also remember to do a little research before shopping; some own-store brands are just as good as big names and can cost considerably less than what you would normally pay.

At £5, Sainsbury's crispy mash hash is the costliest recipe featured

In December 2014, mother of three Deanne Wilson, from Headlingley, Leeds, who relied on benefits after being forced to give up her job due to cancer, said that she could feed her entire family for £30 a week, 

She said she uses the bulk of her budget to buy quality meat, before padding out meals with lots of fresh fruit and vegetables.

'The food is marked down because it's going out of date in a day or so, but because I cook everything fresh every day it makes no difference,' she said.

And just because you're eating on the cheap doesn't mean you have to keep to boring options as these four recipes, contributed by four leading supermarkets, show. 

Prices of all the meals featured here come up to £5 or less .
