Real Madrid defender Raphael Varane is keen to discuss his future with manager Carlo Ancelotti after returning from the World Cup, according to reports in Spain.

Marca claim that the France international is unhappy with his role as an understudy to Sergio Ramos and Pepe and that he could be interested in leaving the Bernabeu this summer.

Varane made just 12 starts in La Liga last season after suffering a knee injury, but he did play the entirety of Real's extra-time win against rivals Atletico Madrid in the Champions League final.

Talks: Real Madrid defender Raphael Varane wants to speak with Carlo Ancelotti according to reports

Understudy: Varane is reportedly unhappy with his lack of playing time at Real last season

Wanted: Real Madrid's Varane is a target of Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho

The 21-year-old starred for his country at the World Cup in Brazil, starting four of Les Bleus' five games as Didier Deschamps' side reached the quarter-final stage.

But he has found opportunities harder to come by at club level, with Ancelotti often preferring to use the experienced duo of Ramos and Pepe in the heart of his defence.

The same report insists that the Italian will ensure Varane knows that he is a big part of the club's plans as they aim to avoid losing him to a Premier League club.

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho is a known admirer of the former Lens youngster, having signed him from the French club and given him his debut in Spain.

Marca also claim that other clubs from England's top-flight are monitoring Varane's situation, although his compatriot Karim Benzema is likely to try and persuade the defender not to leave the Spanish capital.
