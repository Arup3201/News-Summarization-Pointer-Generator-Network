A man trying to sleep off a big night at a Christmas party punched a police horse when he was disturbed by police, an Adelaide court heard on Tuesday.

The court heard that when Colm James Keogh was woken by mounted officers, he lashed out and punched a police horse twice in mouth in December.

However, the 31-year-old has avoided conviction and instead has been placed on a good behaviour bond.

Colm James Keogh was trying to sleep off a big night at a Christmas party dressed only in his underwear and one sock, an Australian court heard on Tuesday

Mr Keogh pleaded guilty in the Adelaide Magistrates Court to one count of disorderly behaviour over the incident last December.

His original charge of ill-treating an animal and two counts of assaulting police were withdrawn.

Mr Keogh's lawyer, Con O'Neill, told the court his client had left a Christmas party at the Hilton Hotel on South Road in Adelaide and remembered getting in a taxi.

He then found himself 'sleeping it off' on Hindley Street in his underwear and wearing one sock.

Mr Keogh next recalled mounted police telling him to wake up and get dressed.

He admitted to punching a police horse which resulted in a swollen hand in the morning.

Mr Keogh spent eight hours in custody and had been 'humiliated by the whole experience'.

'He looks back with shame and embarrassment. Heâ€™s from a culture which loves horses,' his lawyer said.

The drunk Irishman was approached by mounted Adelaide police last December which is when he punched the police horse twice. Pictured are Adelaide police during a parade in 2006

He described his client as 'a gentle giant' and his actions weren't deliberate.

Mr O'Neill said Mr Keogh had alcohol problems but hadn't consumed any since the incident.

'It's not suggested in this case that there was any demonstrable harm cause to the horse, although it must have been discomforted,' the magistrate Paul Bennett said.

'December last year was a difficult time for you because you and your partner lost a child in very tragic circumstances in December 2010, so I understand when December comes around every year it's very sad.'

Mr Keogh was put on a 15-month good behaviour bond, a $600 fine and ordered to pay legal costs.

'You accept that you were very intoxicated at the time,' Mr Bennett said.

'But there's no excuse for you in the fact that you were so intoxicated. It was in fact a shameful thing for you to do.'

Mr Bennett said Mr Keogh had been seeing a psychologist since the offending.

He said there was good reason to suspend the sentence.

The police prosecutor said the incident had left police horse Viking with 'no lasting impact'.

Unit Senior Sergeant Damien Eichner said Viking was on patrol that night as part of a police crackdown on alcohol-fuelled violence and anti-social behaviour, The Advertiser reported in February when Mr Keogh appeared in court.

Senior Sergeant Eichner said attacks on police horses were uncommon and Viking had recovered well.

Mr Keogh is hoping to apply for permanent residency for his family.

It may not have been granted if he had a conviction recorded.
