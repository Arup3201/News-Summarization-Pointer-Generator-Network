It seems that Gemma Collins is taking the mantra 'no carbs before Marbs' seriously.

The TOWIE star and fashion designer checked into raw-vegan detox retreat Slimmeria to embark on a gruelling diet and exercise regime.

However, the 32-year-old reportedly escaped during the night, just six hours after arriving.

It started so well: Gemma Collins, everyone's favourite TOWIE fashionista, checked into Slimmeria detox retreat - but escaped just six hours later while everyone was sleeping

A source told MailOnline: 'Having arrived with her mother on Thursday, she had a massage, a raw vegan meal then an evening talk on nutrition.

'This must have been too much for her, as at 10pm she and her mother packed their bags and left while the other guests were sleeping.

'She didn't even say goodbye to the owner, and had to ask the housekeeper to unlock the gates.'

The luxury retreat, situated in leafy East Sussex, prides itself on its natural detox and fasting regime, supplemented with freshly prepared raw vegetables, juices and soups.

Hours before escaping: A source told MailOnline: 'At 10pm she and her mother packed their bags and left whilst the other guests were sleeping'

Not right for her: The staff at Slimmeria, pictured, think that the raw vegan food wasn't to Gemma's liking

Not giving in that easily! Clearly keen to get in shape ahead of the casts' trip to Marbella, committed Gemma checked straight into another bootcamp, No.1 Bootcamp in Norfolk

'It will stimulate the 
slimming process in a healthy way, and will facilitate quick weight 
loss, without resorting to extremes,' promises the retreat's website.

'We think she left as the food was too little for her and she panicked,' added the source. 'The owner said she and her mother were very on edge at the retreat due to the meal plans and strict exercise regime.

'Fellow Essex girl Lydia Bright stayed for the full four days before Gemma checked in but Gemma escaped the locked gates 
after six hours, whilst everyone was asleep. The owner has 
never had anyone escape the £1,000 per week retreat before.'

Well done, Gemma! Miss Collins may not have enjoyed her time at Slimmeria but the designer decided to give bootcamp another go, this time in Norfolk

But rather than head back to Romford to tuck into some Ben & Jerrys, committed Gemma checked straight into another bootcamp, No.1 Bootcamp in Norfolk, a favourite of Binky Felstead and Spencer Matthews.

The plus-size designer tweeted: 'Had the most wonderful day now off to @no1bootcamp to shake my booty for the bank holiday no partying for moi!'

It seems that Gemma was throwing herself wholeheartedly into the regime, later tweeting: '3 mile run BOOM shak a lak @no1bootcamp @gardenerskbar NO CARBS BEFORE MARBS'.

Speaking to MailOnline, Gemma revealed: 'We're heading to Marbella in seven weeks, it's going to be amazing, watch this space.

'Let's just say, I'm going wild in Marbella!'

And it seems that Romford's 
finest fashionista has reason to celebrate. Last week she won the 'Editor's Choice' award at the 
Reveal Magazine Online Fashion Awards, where she was hailed a 'role 
model' for the industry.

Gemma is most certainly making waves in the fashion industry after 
scooping her second award in less than a year for her plus-size fashion 
collection - the bubbly blonde was named plus-size designer of the year, too.
