Former England and Manchester United striker Michael Owen is confident Luke Shaw is ready for the challenge of being a Red Devils player.

United are trying to sign 18-year-old Southampton defender Shaw, who has been included in England boss Roy Hodgson's squad for this summer's World Cup.

The left-back already has over 50 Barclays Premier League starts and a senior international cap to his name.

And when asked about the prospect of Shaw joining United, Owen, who made such a memorable impact at the 1998 World Cup as an 18-year-old, said: 'I think it's always good to keep progressing up the ladder and to play at the highest standard.

'And once you have had the experience that Luke Shaw has had in the Premier League, I think you are certainly ready for that challenge now.

'Having had the first-team experience he has, and now going to a World Cup, I'd say he is more than ready to join a really big club - if Southampton let him go.'

Should the move to United go through this summer, Shaw will be joining at an interesting time for the club.

The Red Devils are set to undergo considerable change as they look to bounce back from a disappointing 2013/14 season following the retirement of boss Sir Alex Ferguson, with a permanent replacement - Louis van Gaal, it seems - for Ferguson's successor David Moyes coming in and the squad being overhauled.

Owen feels the Shaw transfer would be a good one for all parties concerned.

'United have obviously had a poor campaign by their standards and we talk about rebuilding, but it has only been one season - there is still an awful lot of quality there,' the 34-year-old said.

'They are a huge club with a huge stadium, and I presume they are going to get a huge manager as well.

'I wouldn't have thought they will be coming seventh again next season, put it that way - I think they will be right back in the mix.

'But they 
are going to have to buy quality players like Luke Shaw, and 
particularly in defence, because they have lost Nemanja Vidic and Rio 
Ferdinand, and there is talk about Patrice Evra as well.

'They are going to be hard to replace, but someone like Luke Shaw would go a long way towards that.

'So the only losers would be Southampton - but then again, I'm pretty sure there will be a huge fee involved!'

Shaw is part of a 23-man England World Cup squad that has plenty more youth in it, with the likes of Ross Barkley and Raheem Sterling also included.

While approving of Hodgson's selection and pleased it features several younger players, Owen has also been keen to stress he believes those chosen have been on merit, regardless of their age.

And he is feeling positive about what the group can achieve at the tournament in Brazil.

He said: 'I think a lot of the players we will be pinning our hopes on are youngsters - and that is maybe just a coincidence.

'They have all come off a great season for their clubs, are full of confidence, and I'm hoping one or two of them will star in this tournament.

'I think England are going to surprise a few - I think we could do well.'
