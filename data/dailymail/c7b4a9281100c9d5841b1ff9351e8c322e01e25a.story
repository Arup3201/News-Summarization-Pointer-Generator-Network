A collection of six Messerschmitts which appeared in the epic war film Battle of Britain almost 50 years ago have sold for an estimated £4million after sitting 'forgotten' in a hanger for decades.

The six single-engine fighters - Spanish-built versions based on the famous BF 109 model that fought with the RAF's iconic Spitfires and Hurricanes in the aerial battle over Southern England in 1940 - were found stored in a dusty hangar in Texas, U.S., earlier this year.

The rare planes were used in the classic 1969 war epic that starred a host of international stars including Michael Caine, Laurence Olivier, Trevor Howard, Christopher Plummer and Kenneth Moore.

The filmmakers bought 50 of the Messerschmitts - ironically fitted with the same Rolls Royce Merlin engine that powered the RAF's famous Spitfires and Hurricanes – to recreate the aerial dogfights. They also bought 32 Heinkels and 33 Spitfires and Hurricanes.

After filming ended, the remaining Messerschmitts ended up with Texas oil billionaire and warbird enthusiast Wilson 'Connie' Edwards.

The 80-year-old former movie stunt pilot was given the aircraft as payment for his work in the film.

Now, after 40 years, he has sold the iconic planes to a Swiss company, which plans to restore two of the aircraft and sell the other four.

The four to be sold will be offered to aviation restorers or museums – with experts predicting that a flying version today would be worth around £1.5million. 

Bf 109s like the ones sold were first built and tested during the Spanish Civil War in 1937 and 1938 in order to develop and improve them before the start of the Second World War.

Historic aircraft restorer Tony Ditheridge, who runs Suffolk-based Hawker Restoration which has put more than a dozen Hurricanes back in the air, said: 'This is a remarkable collection - and the opportunity for someone to own an example of one of the most famous aircraft from World War Two.

Designers: Willy Messerschmitt and Robert Lusser

Maximum speed: 385mph at 22,640 feet  

Ceiling: 37,895 feet

Range: 373 miles

Guns: 2 × 13 mm machine guns and 1 × 20 mm cannon

Bombs: 1 × 250 kg  bomb or 4 × 50 kg  bombs 

'The original versions of this type of Messerschmitt were flown in the Spanish Civil War and a genuine German WW2 model in restored condition would fetch more than £3.5million.

'The Messerschmitt was the most numerous production aircraft of its time and a pivotal part of the Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain but very few survive.

'This version was pretty unpleasant to fly but there will be a lot of interest in these aircraft.'

Swiss company Boschung Global Ltd. has acquired the six planes, which includes the only surviving factory two-seater Messerschmitt ME 109.

Although the ME 109 is the world's most manufactured fighter plane, there are only a handful still in existence worldwide.

Company spokesman Paul Boschung said: 'The deal with former movie stunt pilot Wilson 'Connie' Edwards was certainly no ordinary sale.

'It took several months and, in many respects, was an incredibly interesting project.

'The transaction was carried out seamlessly thanks to the assistance of Platinum Fighter Sales, the leading specialists in the trade of Warbirds in the US.'

Boschung Global will now restore the aircraft to original factory condition before selling them on.
