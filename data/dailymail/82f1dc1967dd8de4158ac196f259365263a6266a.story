The U.S. Navy has carried out ground breaking tests of its unmanned drone X-47B alongside a manned F/A-18 fighter jet.

The tests were conducted on the carrier deck of the Theodore Roosevelt in the eastern Atlantic Ocean on August 17. It was the first time that the two aircraft have operated from the same carrier.

Capt. Beau Duarte said: ‘Today we showed that the X-47B could take off, land and fly in the carrier pattern with manned aircraft while maintaining normal flight deck operations.’

'This is key for the future carrier air wing,’ he added.

Capt. Duarte - the program manager for the Navy's unmanned carrier aviation office - along with Navy officials said that the test flights were a milestone in carrier-based naval aviation.

On Sunday morning, the drone flew in the landing pattern with the F/A-18 at speeds of 120 mph, at a pattern altitude of 1,200 feet, according to manufacturer Northrop Grumman Corp.

After a short flight, the X-47B came in for an arrested landing where a deck-based operator used a deck handling control to manually move it out of the way and taxied it out of the landing area.

The F/A-18 then touched down, close behind the drone.

‘This cooperative launch and recovery sequence will be repeated multiple times over the course of the planned test periods,’ a Navy spokesman told The Los Angeles Times.

‘The X-47B performed multiple arrested landings, catapults, flight deck taxiing and deck refuelling operations.’

Combat drones are mostly used by the Air Force and CIA.

The drones have a range of more than 2,400 miles and can be navigated by a human pilot even if they are located thousands of miles away – making it a military asset.

It also means that missions carried out by drones can be conducted by a computer to chart its course.

Navy fighter pilots fly missions for over 10 hours, but drones can fly for three times that long.

The X-47B is jet-powered and has a weapons bay with a payload capacity of 4,500 pounds.

The drone has a 62-foot wingspan and can fly higher than 40,000 feet.

Its nickname is ‘Salty Dog 502.’

Built by Northrop Grumman Corp., it looks like a mini-B-2 stealth bomber.

But the X-47B was designed as an experimental jet and stands at the cutting edge of technology showing how an automated system can work.

The Navy has confirmed that it will carry out similar tests to the one done on Sunday, in the near future.

However while the exact cost of the test is unknown, there are estimates that the entire programme  costs as much as $6billion.
