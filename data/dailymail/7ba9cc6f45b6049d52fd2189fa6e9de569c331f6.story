Turned away: The head of the Syrian Olympic Committee General Mowaffak Joumaa, pictured, has been refused a visa to travel to London for the Games, according to reports

The head of the Syrian Olympic Committee has been refused a visa to travel to London for the Games, according to reports.

There had been suggestions for months that General Mowaffak Joumaa would be barred from entering the UK because of his connection to the Syrian military.

The BBC said the application has been refused because of his links to the regime of Syria’s President Bashar Assad.

The troubled Middle East state has seen a recent spike in violence by the forces of President Assad’s regime.

Just today a video emerged showing 
more than a dozen bloodied corpses, some of them piled on top of each 
other and in military uniforms.

The Home Office is responsible for 
carrying out background checks on behalf of the International Olympic 
Committee (IOC) and advises the committee on whether an applicant is 
suitable for accreditation.

The Foreign Office is also involved 
in exclusion decisions. Particular interest would be shown in visitors 
from countries where there are human rights abuses.

Officials are expected to keep a close eye on Syria.

Foreign Secretary William Hague has 
compared the recent massacres in Syria to those in Bosnia in the 1990s 
while Prime Minister David Cameron has condemned the killings as 'brutal
and sickening'.

The Syrian charge d’affaires in London has already been expelled in the wake of mounting condemnation of recent attacks.

The government claimed the deaths shown in the video released today were from a 'massacre' by rebels in the northern 
province of Aleppo. 

The circumstances of the killings are not clear but the
narrator said the dead were members of the 'shabiha,' or pro-regime 
gunmen. 

Syria's state-run news agency, SANA, said terrorist groups had killed 
and mutilated at least 25 people in Daret Azzeh, a rebel-held area in 
the Aleppo countryside.

Advice: The Home Office is responsible for carrying out background checks on behalf of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and advises the committee on whether an applicant is suitable for accreditation

The government refers to the rebels as terrorists. 

'The terrorist groups in Daret Azzeh committed a brutal massacre against
the citizens, whom they had kidnapped earlier in the day,' SANA said. 

The report said at least 25 people were killed, but others were missing. 

The regime has been condemned by Britain for its crackdown on opponents.

It is thought that Syrian athletes may receive visas because those of Olympic standard are not required to serve in the armed forces, but there is a question mark against General Joumaa and other officials.

Condemned: Prime Minister David Cameron has previously said the killings taking place in Syria under President Bashar Assad's regime are 'brutal and sickening'

An IOC spokesman said: 'At this stage we have not yet received any official approach on this issue and it would be premature to comment on any individual cases.'

The uprising against President Bashar Assad's regime began in 
March last year.

Activists say more than 
14,000 people have been killed since it began. 

Thousands of soldiers have abandoned the regime, but most are low-level 
conscripts. The Free Syria Army, the loosely linked group of rebel 
forces, is made up largely of defectors.

Grim: A video emerged from the Syrian city of Aleppo today showing more than a dozen bloodied corpses, some of them piled on top of each other and in military uniforms. This is a still from that video

Accusations: The Syrian government claimed the deaths shown in the video released today were from a 'massacre' by rebels

Homs, Syria's third largest city, has been one of the hardest hit regions since the uprising began.

Rebels control several neighborhoods, which government troops have attacked intensely over the past two weeks. Activists said conditions in the areas under siege are growing more dire by the day.

In some parts, there is barely any electricity or running water, telephone lines are unreliable and residents are forced to hide in shelters during daily shelling.

Referring to reports of General Mowaffak Joumaa being barred from entering the UK,  the Home Office said: 'We are not commenting on individual cases.'
