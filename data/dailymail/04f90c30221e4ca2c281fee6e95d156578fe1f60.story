Jon Jones has been letting off steam with a shooting trip in the desert as he awaits news of the next defence of his UFC light-heavyweight title.

Jones recently beat Daniel Cormier before it was revealed he had tested positive for cocaine during a routine drug test in December.

The American is expected to face Anthony Johnson after his stunning first-round victory over Alexander Gustafsson in Sweden last month.

Jones posted several videos on Instragram which showed an array of guns as he also attempted some off-road 4x4 driving.

The 27-year-old spent a night in rehab after his positive test was announced and later said: ‘This whole situation has been really embarrassing.

‘I had to explain to so many people that I’m not a cocaine addict by any means or not even a frequent user.

‘I just made a really dumb decision and got caught with my pants down in this whole situation. No excuse for it. I can just apologise.’
