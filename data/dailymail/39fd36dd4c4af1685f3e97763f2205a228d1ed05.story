A former caretaker for Benjamin Netanyahu is suing the Israeli Prime Minister over allegations that he was mistreated and verbally abused by the leader’s wife, it was revealed last night.

Meni Naftali - who is seeking around £110,000 in damages - claims he was repeatedly subjected to abusive language, including an ethnic slur, by Sara Netanyahu during his 20 months on the job.

In one instance, Mr Naftali said that Mrs Netanyahu called him at 3am to complain that he had bought milk in a plastic storage bag instead of a carton, according to the lawsuit.

In another, Mr Naftali claimed that 
she chastised him because some flowers in a vase were a day old, 
comparing the residence to the French presidential palace.

‘She
 flung [the flowers] to the floor, as she yelled at Mr Naftali - calling
 him “a bad housekeeper”, and that something like that would never occur
 in the “Elysee Palace”,’ the lawsuit says.

Mr
 Naftali also claimed that Mrs Netanyahu derided his ethnicity when he 
ordered food for them in a hotel, implying that his Middle Eastern 
background was somehow uncouth.

She
 allegedly told him: ‘We are Europeans. We are refined, we don't eat as 
much as you Moroccans... You are fattening us and then when we are 
photographed abroad, we look fat.’

Mr
 Naftali also claimed that Mrs Netanyahu berated him for bringing his 
children to the residence on Israeli Independence Day, a national 
holiday.

What Sara Netanyahu allegedly said

‘While it was 
clear that during the meal he could leave with them to his house, Mrs 
Netanyahu did not like this and asked that the children leave the house 
immediately,’ the lawsuit says.

It
 is the latest in a string of cases to taint Israel's first family, who 
have been accused of enjoying an extravagant lifestyle while ignoring 
the plight of the struggling middle class.

Mr
 Naftali, who is in his mid-30s, said he served in an elite military 
unit before joining the staff as a bodyguard to Mr Netanyahu's two sons.

He
 transferred to the housekeeping staff in February 2011 and remained 
there until leaving in November 2012. Mr Netanyahu's office rejected the
 claims in the lawsuit as ‘outrageous.’

Mrs
 Netanyahu has been a lightning rod for criticism going back to her 
husband's first term in the 1990s, when she was criticised for allegedly
 squabbling with her staff and meddling in state affairs.

Among
 other things, she was accused of firing a nanny for burning a pot of 
soup and of throwing a pair of shoes at an assistant.

In
 December, the prime minister came under fire after a watchdog group 
obtained expense reports showing heavy spending on scented candles and 
floral arrangements at his official residence.

In a statement, Mr Netanyahu's office noted that Mr Naftali
filed the lawsuit after his request to receive a permanent position on the
staff was rejected.

‘If it was so bad for him at the prime minister's residence,
why did he ask to work there permanently?’ it said.

The lawsuit was filed to the the Jerusalem district labour court in Israel.
