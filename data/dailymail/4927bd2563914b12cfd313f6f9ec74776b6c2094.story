Australian Olympic champion James Magnussen has been upstaged by lesser known rival Cameron McEvoy in a shock 100m freestyle final at the Pan Pacific championships.

The Gold Coast event that many had tipped in-form Magnussen to win comfortably, was all McEvoy's who celebrated beating US swimmer Nathan Adrian, second and Magnussen third.

McEvoy, 20, clocked a meet record of 47.82 seconds to grab 100m gold ahead of Adrian (48.30) and Magnussen (48.36).

The 20-year-old, who had announced himself as a global force by upsetting Magnussen at the 2014 national titles, shined in a strong field also boasting Olympic great Michael Phelps who finished fourth.

Complaining of a 'dodgy back' all week, Magnussen credited his rival with the win after pushing through for gutsy Bronze.

'This time a week ago, I had all but ruled myself out,' Magnussen said.

'I was in hospital getting an epidural and a couple of cortisone's - I wasn't in a good way.

'I thought they only gave epidurals to women who had babies.

'So I was really worried when they gave me that one.'

He said the opportunity to swim at the elite level against such a formidable lineup was what willed him on to compete. 

'You only get a few times in your lifetime to represent your country so I was pretty determined to swim tonight,' he said.

'I put it on the line tonight - it was all I had.'

Adrian, of the US, admitted McEvoy's heroics had blown the 100m race wide open.

'It's silly to think James and I are going to be winning every time - it's not a two-man game anymore,' he said.

In the women's 100m freestyle Australia's world champion Cate Campbell  nabbed gold ahead of sister Bronte.

Cate Campbell reasserted her dominance with a .27 second win over her sister, winning in a time of 52.72  seconds.

Campbell said post-race that she would not be denied in the final and would battle hard to the next Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

'I almost don't want a break before Rio,' Cate said.

'But I will take some time off (before 2015 world titles) but everything is looking really good.'

Her sister and silver medalist Bronte added: 'I don't know if I am getting used to being second but I am getting used to racing at an elite level.'

Australia's Bronte Barratt, Emma McKeon, Brittany Elmslie and Melanie Schlanger (7:47.47) claimed silver in the women's 4x200m freestyle behind world champions the US.

Australia's team of David McKeon, McEvoy, Mack Horton and Thomas Fraser-Holmes (7:08.55) claimed bronze in the men's 4x200m freestyle relay behind the Michael Phelps-led US (7:05.17).

Australia's Keryn McMaster (4:38.84) took 400m IM bronze behind American Elizabeth Beisel (meet record 4:31.99) while Japan's Kosuke Hagino (4:08.31) claimed the men's crown.

American Jessica Hardy (1:06.74) won 100m women's breaststroke gold while Japan's Yasuhiro Koseki (59.62) claimed the men's crown.
