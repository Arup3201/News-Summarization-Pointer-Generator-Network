Several times at Goodison Park on Saturday I was left gasping at the quality of David Silva, he’s a joy to watch.

And he’s not the only one.

I’ve been out of my seat at some of the quality in the Premier League this season – Cesc Fabregas’ range of passing, Wayne Rooney’s quality, Eden Hazard’s running with the ball, Sergio Aguero’s breathtaking goals, Alexis Sanchez’s twists and turns, even Alex Song at West Ham has shown some class in midfield, while Andy Carroll’s goal at Swansea made light work of all the clowns who see him solely as a big lump up front.

There is some real quality in the Premier League.

So why has Southampton’s dour display of dire defensive doggedness at Old Trafford on Sunday been widely applauded?

It’s three points, it’s a win, for Saints fans it’s brilliant. But as a neutral football observer it was awful to see two top-four teams go head to head, yet only one of them trying to play football reflecting their position in the league.

Manchester United should have scored – twice they carved Saints open but Juan Mata failed to finish both chances. So the away side got lucky at one end.

And then at the other end Graziano Pelle fired in a shot that hit the post and could have gone anywhere. It fell to Dusan Tadic and Southampton scored. That’s another stroke of luck.

So, in the same way Saints were unlucky to lose at Arsenal earlier this season - in a very similar game, they created next to nothing, were organised, but played very little football and the Gunners only broke through when Saints went down to 10 men because of injury - they got extremely lucky at Old Trafford by getting a break at one end, and seeing United miss two sitters.

Maybe luck balances itself out, but Southampton in my view are too good to be relying on luck that may or may not go their way.

I’ll stress that if you’re a Southampton fan it doesn’t matter how your team wins – good luck to them, they can enjoy it.

But let’s not fool ourselves here, Southampton didn’t go up there to play. And that’s a shame.

I was at St Mary’s when Ronald Koeman’s side reduced Sunderland to a gibbering wreck earlier this season with a stunning display of brilliant passing football played at a tempo few teams can sustain. Saints were sensational. I want to see more of that.

At Old Trafford though, they had 11 Victor Wanyamas on the pitch. Only with a dollop of luck will that win you the game, and that’s exactly what happened.

I can hear the stat-monsters screaming about United failing to get a shot on target:

1) It’s not true. A Robin van Persie effort was on target in the first half but was blocked by a defender. For some reason the official statistics don’t count a shot blocked by an opposition player, which is weird.

Louis van Gaal's side failed to find a way past Southampton who arrived at United with a defensive gameplan

2) One shot on target doesn’t mean that United didn’t play good football and create chances. It only means their finishing on the day was wayward. Before the weekend only the top two had scored more than United in the Premier League this season so it was just one of those off days in front of goal for United, and in particular  Mata.

In the final analysis, Southampton won the game, picked up three points and everyone connected with the club is happy. For them, that’s all that matters – a win is a win.

For the many United-haters across the football world, it will be right up there with their disastrous displays at Leicester and MK Dons.

Alex Sanchez has lit up the Premier League with his goals and creative play for Arsenal

But for lovers of the beautiful game, there is an acceptance that defending is part of the 90 minutes, but there is also a desire to see expansive football. Knowing that Southampton are capable of so much more leaves the neutral frustrated that they didn’t go to Old Trafford to show us all what they can do.

Pressing the opposition and pressing them high up the pitch is admirable – Barcelona have enjoyed stunning success doing that. But Barca played sparkling special football at the same time and that’s what I thought we’d see from Southampton on Sunday. Unfortunately it didn’t happen.

Historically, the Premier League’s most admired teams have a bit of everything. Not just an ability to stop the opposition.

If Southampton produce an end-of-season DVD entitled '101 Great Moments Closing Down the Opposition' expect the victory at Manchester United to feature highly.

In Cesc Fabregas and Alexis Sanchez there is real quality in England

So, it's a shock that a dour Southampton display was so well received

@highlight

Manchester United were the only team wanting to play football on Sunday

All that mattered for Southampton is the victory and the three points
