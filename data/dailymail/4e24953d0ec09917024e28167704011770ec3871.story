Three people have been arrested after the skeletal remains of two men were found in a backyard of a home owned by Satanists in a North Carolina village.

Pazuzu Illah Algarad, 35, was arrested and charged with murder last Sunday after the two bodies were discovered in shallow graves at the house in Clemmons where neighbors say he has performed animal sacrifices and satanic rituals.

A friend claims that he had 'told everyone' about the bodies, but nobody believed him, and he described how he killed them, ate part of them and then burned the rest in a fire pit.  

Amber Nicole Burch, 24, who lives with Algarad and is described as his wife on Facebook, was also charged with murder, while 28-year-old Krystal Nicole Matlock has  been charged as an accessory with police alleging that she helped bury the bodies.

The first victim has been identified as 37-year-old Joshua Fredrick Wetzler while the second victim has been named as Tommy Dean Welch, 36.

Police have said they also found animal bones in the property and that more arrests as part of the investigation are possible. 

After the trio were detained, Forsyth District Judge Gordon Miller assigned capital defenders to represent them. 

Miller told them that if convicted, they could receive life in prison without the possibility of parole or the death penalty. They are set to appear in court on October 23. 

Assisted: Krystal Nicole Matlock, 28, has been charged as an accessory with police alleging she helped bury the bodies 

On the front door of the house where the skeletal remains were found was a sign warning law-enforcement not to enter.

It reads: 'No gang members allowed: anyone that dresses the same, has the same badge and call themselves the authority of the land they did not create. Below and to the right is a picture of a skull and cross bones. 

Under that picture are the words, 'Evil will triumph'.

According to the Winston-Salem Journal, Algarad was born in San Francisco, California, as John Lawson, but dropped out of high school, became a drug dealer.

His mother Cynthia Lawson, who is also a Satanist, changed his name to Pazuzu - after the devil that possessed the girl in the film The Exorcis - and claimed it was of Iraqi descent.

The Camel City Dispatch reported that his friends said he tried to paint a picture of himself serial killer Charles Manson, founder of the Church of Satan Anton LaVay, and British occultist Aleister Crowley.

His tongue was split down the middle like a snake and he allegedly filed down his teeth to sharpen them.  

In 2010, Algarad was convicted on a charge of accessory after the fact in the shooting death of 30-year-old Joseph Chandler. 

Chandler's body was found near a river by police after his mother reported him missing that morning.

According to state records, Algarad was on probation at the time the bodies were found on Sunday.  

Scene: Police found the bodies of two men behind the property on Knob Hill Drive in Clemmons, North Carolina 

Victims: They have been identified as Joshua Fredrick Wetzler, 37, (left) and Tommy Dean Welch, 36 (right)

Entrance: On the front door is a replica skeleton head and a sign warning off law enforcement from entering

Bianca Heath claimed she lived with Algarad for a month in 2005, and that he had spoken of the bones in his back yard.

She told The Huffington Post: 'Paz told everyone. But I never believed him. I'm sure no one else believed him either. He laughed about the skeletal remains when telling the story on why he did what he did.'

Heath said Algarad told her he picked up two prostitutes at two separate locations before he killed and ate them, burning the remains in a fire pit before burying the rest. 

In 2011, Burch was accused of slapping Algarad's mother in the face and attempting to choke her.

She is described as Algarad's wife on Facebook, but authorities have said there is no legal document to suggest they are together.  

Couple: Algarad and Burch shared a home in  Clemmons, North Carolina, where animal sacrifices and animal rituals were performed, according to neighbors
