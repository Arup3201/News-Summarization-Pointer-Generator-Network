Tinder is planning to set up a premium service allowing paying users of the app to have more match-making powers. 

Sean Rad, the two-year-old company's CEO and founder made the announcement at the Forbes Under 30 Summit in Philadelphia. 

He told the magazine that the new feature will be released in November and could involve travel, meaning location limits could be scrapped.

'Freemium model': Tinder is set to release a new feature next month that will give paying users more matchmaking powers 

The 'freemium model' is popular with users and has already been adopted by sites including OkCupid and Match.com.  

Without going into details, he also hinted that the service could expand beyond online dating and could move into restaurant and bar recommendations.

Tinder lets you swipe though an endless stream of photos of people looking to meet up.

Each profile only has a handful of photos - but you can only interact with people in the city you're currently in. 

He said: 'We are adding features users have been begging us for. They will offer so much value we think users are willing to pay for them.'

'We had to get our product and growth right first. Revenue has always been on the road map.'

The app, that has become popular around the globe, sees 1.2billion profiles swiped and 15million matches mad every day. 

The upgrade will mean users can still use the free version, but a fee will give them access to better features.

When Rad announced that the app had hit 10million likes a day in February - he claimed that individuals were using it seven times a day on average. 

It generated at least 75 million matches in 2013 after launching at a University of Southern California party.

The same month the app was first used in Antarctica when a lonely scientist working at the McMurdo Station  revealed that he recently turned to Tinder to find a mate and was pleasantly surprised to find one – even though she was a 45 minute helicopter ride away.
