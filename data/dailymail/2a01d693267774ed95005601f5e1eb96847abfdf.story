A father was beaten up and thrown off the side of a 
bridge in Argentina by striking trade unionists after he begged them to let him pass so that he could take his pregnant wife to hospital.

Disabled Razl Lezcano, 27, who has an artificial leg, had decided not to wait for an ambulance and instead put his three-month pregnant wife on the back of the motorbike when she reported getting severe stomach pains.

When they got close to the hospital they were stopped at a Puente Avellaneda bridge in the Argentinian capital of Buenos Aires by members of the transport workers union who have blocked the road in a protest to demand more pay and better conditions.

A disabled man was beaten up and thrown off the side of a bridge in Argentina by striking trade unionists after he begged them to let him pass so that he could take his pregnant wife to hospital

Razl Lezcano, 27, who has an artificial leg, had decided not to wait for an ambulance and instead put his three-month pregnant wife on the back of the motorbike when she reported getting severe stomach pains

His tearful wife Ana said: 'There was a large crowd at the bridge just before the hospital and he got off the bike and went over to ask if they would let us past.

'They ignored him and when he asked a second time, one of them punched him in the face.

'Then the others started beating him up and then they robbed him, stealing his wallet and mobile phone before picking him up above their heads - taking him to the side of the bridge and throwing him onto the road below.

'They ignored him and when he asked a second time, one of them punched him in the face,' she said

'They could see that he was disabled, he has had an orthopaedic leg since he was 17.

'They have even tried to steal that but they couldn't get it off, so they just threw him and the leg over the edge of the bridge. They were like animals, they didn't care if he died.'

Images of the brutal attack on the young father caused shock in the South American country and prompted Juan Corvalan, the head of SUPA union whose members are accused of carrying out the attack, to step down.

The man was dragged onto the bridge and beaten as she wife watched in fear

He said: 'This is not the image I want for my union. I am a worker myself, not only a union leader. I was deeply upset by the images.'

But the union was criticised further after nobody visited the-critically ill man and there was no offer of compensation to help with the medical bills and suffering for him and his family.

Doctors meanwhile confirmed that despite the woman's stomach pains the unborn child is still developing well, although they warned that the current stress was not good for the pregnancy.
