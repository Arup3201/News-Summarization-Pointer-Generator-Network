A blood test being developed by a group of Australian scientists could predict Alzheimer's disease two decades before patients show signs of the illness.

University of Melbourne researchers, who discovered the test, previously helped identify changes in the brain happened 20 years before people started presenting symptoms of the disease, which can be detected by performing brain-imaging procedures.

Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia with sufferers having deteriorating memory loss which gets worse over time as well as affecting their behaviour.

University of Melbourne researchers are on the cusp of developing a blood test that could detect Alzheimer's disease

The blood test would have a 91 per cent rate of accuracy in predicting Alzheimer's and could be available within five years as further testing is yet to be carried out.

Initial research carried out on a trial group resulted in one of five participants  positive for the disease despite having no memory loss.

Further tests carried out using brain-imaging procedures showed these patients had signs of degeneration associated with Alzheimer's.

The research was carried out by the university's Department of Biochemistry, Molecular and Cell Biology Bio21 Institute.

The department's Dr Lesley Cheng said the test had the potential to predict Alzheimer's up to 20 years before sufferers showed signs of the disease.

She told Daily Mail Australia that the data available from their research could only provide a five-year detection as it had only been going for seven years, but with more participants they would be able to match up brain-imaging techniques with blood tests to track how far back it could predict. 

'We wanted to develop a blood test to be used as a pre-screen to identify [patients] who needed a brain scan and those it was unnecessary to do a brain scan,' Dr Cheng said. 

Dr  Cheng said it would also provide a more accessible method for people to accurately find out how likely they were to get the disease.

'This test provides the possibility of early detection of AD by using a simple blood test which has been designed to also be cost-effective,' she said.

'Furthermore, it is highly accessible for patients and physicians compared to organising a brain scan or undergoing a neuropsychological test.

'Patients with a family history of AD or those with memory concerns could be tested during a standard health check at a medical clinic. 

'This test could ease concerns for patients experiencing normal memory problems due to natural ageing. Those identified as high risk could then be monitored by their doctor.' 

The University of Melbourne findings were published in science journal Molecular Psychiatry in collaboration with The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, the CSIRO, Austin Health and Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing.
