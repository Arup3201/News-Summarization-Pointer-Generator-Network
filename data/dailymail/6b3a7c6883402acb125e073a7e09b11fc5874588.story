Ciro Immobile sent out a warning shot to Roy Hodgson's England as the Italian striker tore Brazilian club giants Fluminense to pieces in the Azzurri's final World Cup warm-up.

Six days out from their meeting in Manaus, Borussia Dortmund's Â£15.6million new boy scored a hat trick and set up two for Lorenzo Insigne as the Italians ran out 5-3 winners in Volta Redonda.

Top scorer in Serie A for Torino this season, Immobile may have given Cesare Prandelli a dilemma. But so too did his leaky defence as the Italians looked shaky across the backline, conceding three goals to the club side.

The ninth best team in the world against an outfit sitting second in the Brazilian Championship, for a time it looked like this could be another pre-tournament blip from the Italians.

Fresh from a dour stalemate with the Republic of Ireland and a shock 1-1 draw with minnows Luxembourg, Prandelli sent out his second string to right some wrongs. And yet they found themselves again level after a chaotic first half.

In the absence of Mario Balotelli and Antonio Cassano it was left to Immobile to lead the line as Italy's lone striker with Insigne and Alessio Cerci operating off him. Once things warmed up, it was to prove a lethal combination.

Marco Parolo, operating alongside skipper Alberto Aquilani in front of Thiago Motta in the Azzurri engine room, split the defence with a delicious ball on 26 minutes. Immobile looked very mobile as he sprung the offside trap, rounded Felipe Garcia in goals and unselfishly (especially so considering he had yet to open his international account at that stage) crossed for Insigne to tap in.

But Fluminense roared back and having ignored the early warning signs the Italian defence were undone by Dario Conca.

The Argentine was not so long ago one of the highest paid players in the world when he played under Italy's 2006 World Cup winning coach Marcello Lippi in China, and he was relishing this stage. A beautiful ball sent Gustavo Scarpa clear down the left and his cross left Chiquinho with a tap in.

It sent the partisan capacity crowd into raptures and was yet another pre-tournament wake-up call for the Italians. They responded rapidly though when Insigne returned the favour for Immobile to break his national team duck on his third cap.

A wicked free kick from the left was flashed into the far corner off the striker's head and Italy were back in front.

But again it was not for long...five minutes to be exact as left back Carlinhos was allowed free reign by AC Milan's Ignacio Abate to send a weak shot across the face of goal that somehow squirmed under debutant Mattia Perin. It's pretty clear why Gianluigi Buffon has 140 caps to his name.

But all was changed utterly in a stunning three-minute spell after the interval when the second string had surely been on the sharp end of Prandelli's tongue.

Immobile was unplayable as he roamed across the Fluminense backline. First he was on hand to tap in the rebound when Alessio Cerci's shot was parried. Less than 60 seconds later he again made a joke of the offside trap to latch on to Aquilani's pass and expertly finish for his hat-trick.

Then another minute later he repeated the trick a third time and again centred for Insigne's second.

Italy
 were somehow 5-2 up after 54 minutes and Prandelli was free to empty 
the bench making the fourth official's life a nightmare with an 
eight-man substitution on the hour mark.

In
 came Pirlo, Balotelli, De Rossi - shaking off a training knock - and 
others. While substitute Matheus Carvalho scored perhaps the pick of a 
fine bunch of goals with a pile-driver on 62 minutes, the Italians A 
late injury scare when Balotelli crumpled under a challenge briefly had 
hearts in mouth but the AC Milan striker was fine to play out the game 
on a night that very much belonged to Immobile.
