Chelsea announced a record annual profit of around £18.4million on Thursday — paving the way for Jose Mourinho to further strengthen his squad in January.

The current Premier League leaders also reported a record turnover of £319.8m for the year up to June 30, and will comfortably pass UEFA’s Financial Fair Play (FFP) test thanks to the funds brought in by the sale of Juan Mata and David Luiz, plus their share of the new £1bn television deal.

This is the second time in three years that Chelsea have posted a profit and is further proof of the club's emergence as British football’s leading club on and off the pitch, confounding the belief that years of wild spending under Roman Abramovich would backfire.

Chelsea are set to announce a report profit of £20m for the year ending on June 30

2004 - Loss £74.7m

2005 - Loss £131.6m

2006 - Loss £77.1m

2007 - Loss £65.6m

2008 - Loss £69.2m

2009 - Loss £45.8m

2010 - Loss £69.2m

2011 - Loss £70.7m

2012 - Profit £1.4m

2013 - Loss £49.4m

2014 - Profit 18.4m 

Although they turned a £67m loss into a £1.4m profit in 2012, this is the first real sign that Chelsea are making progress without having to rely on the wealth of their billionaire Russian owner, and the cash bounty could enable Mourinho to bring in new recruits when the transfer window re-opens in order to cement what is already looking like becoming a successful title challenge.

 Chairman Bruce Buck said: ‘The club is naturally pleased to record a significant profit for 2013/14. By reaching the Champions League semi-final and maintaining a challenge in the Premier League until the final week of the season we demonstrated that, while improving our financial figures, we remained competitive in football’s toughest club competitions.

‘We financed player purchases from sales as the squad for this current season was shaped, and our philosophy since Mr Abramovich acquired the club in 2003 has been to build upon success on the pitch. 

'That is evident in the partnerships we signed and in our fanbase growth which contributed to the new record turnover figure and the profit made. We have done all of this at the same time as creating one of the world’s leading football community programmes through the Chelsea Foundation. 

Juan Mata was sold to Manchester United in January in a £38million deal

David Luiz left Chelsea for Paris Saint-Germain this summer in a £50million move

‘Going forward, we have ambitious plans to build a pioneering global commercial programme, partnering with innovative and market-leading organisations from around the world. In the era of FFP, we must progress commercially to continue the circle of success to invest in the team and get results.’ 

Meanwhile, the club are unlikely to move to a new stadium for at least seven years. After failing with a £300m bid for the site of the Battersea power station, they are now looking at the possibility of expanding Stamford Bridge, despite the fact it could prove far more costly.

Even if they agree on a new site, estimates suggest it would be five years before work began and a further two years to complete.
