David Cameron was urged to ditch EU green energy targets last night, amid warnings they will add £150 to the average family’s bills over the next five years.

The Prime Minister will travel to Brussels this afternoon to debate stretching new targets that will require Britain to slash carbon emissions by 40 per cent by 2030.

But a new report from the respected think tank Open Europe warns that existing targets are already putting Britain’s economy and living standards at risk, and calls for them to be ditched.

Ministers insist that the targets will strengthen Britain’s energy supplies and, in the long term, produce thousands of ‘green jobs’.

But today’s study, based on an analysis of official Government figures, suggests that EU green measures have already added £59 to the average dual fuel energy bill in this country.

It suggests this figure will rise to £149 by 2020 as the Government strives to meet a binding target of producing 15 per cent of electricity from renewable sources.

Today’s report warns that the impact on business will be even greater, with the average medium-sized firm set to see its energy bills rise by 23 per cent as a result of green measures emanating from Brussels.

And it says the potential economic benefits of meeting the targets have been grossly over-stated.

The report’s author Raoul Ruparel said Mr Cameron should now push for the targets to be abandoned. If other EU leaders refuse, the UK should drop them unilaterally.

He added: ‘Despite admirable goals the EU’s green policies have imposed huge costs but delivered limited benefit and are marred by conflicting objectives.

'With people in the UK concerned about the cost of living, business still struggling to balance their books and Europe needing a more flexible energy supply to wean itself off dependence on Russian gas, a radical re-think of the EU’s energy policy is now vital. Neither the EU nor the UK can afford to waste more time on a costly and failing policy.’

The Department for Energy and Climate Change last night said it ‘does not recognise’ the Open Europe analysis – and insisted that the drive for green energy was reducing bills.

The existing EU targets require the UK to increase the proportion of energy produced from renewable sources like wind farms from about four per cent in 2012 to 15 per cent by 2020

A spokesman said: ‘We don’t recognise the way these figures have been presented. We estimate that, in 2013, household energy bills were, on average, around five per cent lower than they would have been in the absence of all our energy and climate change policies. In 2020, we estimate that our policies will continue to reduce energy bills.

‘We need a diverse energy mix that includes renewable sources like wind and solar in order to reduce our reliance on imports from often volatile parts of the world.’

The existing EU targets require the UK to increase the proportion of energy produced from renewable sources like wind farms from about four per cent in 2012 to 15 per cent by 2020 – the fastest increase in the EU

Today’s report says this will require about 30 per cent of electricity to come from alternative sources, mostly on-shore wind, which enjoys large subsidies from the taxpayer.

Today’s report suggests this would be dwarfed by potential savings of up to £21 billion that would be achieved by ignoring the targets. File picture

The targets are legally binding and Britain could face swingeing fines from Brussels of more than £220 million a year if it abandons them unilaterally.

But today’s report suggests this would be dwarfed by potential savings of up to £21 billion that would be achieved by ignoring the targets – money that could be ploughed into insulating homes and improving energy efficiency.

The study also suggests that projected benefits of meeting the targets have been based on a series of ‘flawed assumptions’.

Most importantly, the EU initiative has not led to a global deal on emissions. As a result the benefit to the UK of £160 billion, which was predicted in 2009, has instead turned into a likely net cost of £17 billion.

In addition, the study says that the plan has failed to boost Britain’s energy security and has instead exacerbated a potential energy crunch’.

Downing Street yesterday said it supported the drive to cut EU carbon emissions by 40 per cent by 2030, but said any new deal needed to be ‘cost-effective, fair and flexible’.
