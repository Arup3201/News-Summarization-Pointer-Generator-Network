Her TV show may have been axed.

But that didn't stop All My Children star Susan Lucci letting her hair down for the glitzy Daytime Emmy Awards last night in Las Vegas.

The 64-year-old actress took a gamble, wearing a cleavage-boosting short white dress as she took to the red carpet.

She was joined there by her only 
daughter, daughter Liza Huber, 36, who looked elegant in  full-length 
green dress and was certainly dressed more conservatively than her 
mother.

Grandmother of three Lucci has been on the show All My Children since its inception in 1970.

However it was announced earlier this
year that the American soap will be cancelled due to poor ratings after
more than 40 years on the air.

Fellow ABC soap One Life to Live is also bowing out for the same reason.

Icon: Lucci played the role or Erica Kane in the American soap for more than 40 years. It will air for the last time in September after being axed over falling ratings

Lucci, who plays diva Erica Kane, became more famous for an off-stage drama when she was 
nominated for 18 years for a Daytime Emmy Award as best actress without 
winning - until she finally took home a trophy in 1999.

There were no wins for her last 
night, though, although her co-star Brittany Allen, 25, who plays Marisa
Chandler, did take the honour for Outstanding Younger Actress in a 
Drama Series.

All My Children - which will air for the last time in September - was nominated for six awards in total, taking home one award.

One Life To Live, which finishes 
filming in January, scooped no gongs - but was nominated for Outstanding
Drama Series Directing Team.

It turned out to be a tie, with The Bold and the Beautiful and The Young and the Restless taking home the honour.

who recently ended her lauded talk show after 25 years, will be 
honoured for changing the face of daytime television during the show 
hosted by Wayne Brady and broadcast live on CBS.

The 38th 
annual ceremony honouring everything from soap operas to game shows to 
talk shows was to see a parade of stars like nominees Philbin and 
Meredith Vieira joining Winfrey on the way out.

Philbin is 
leaving his syndicated chat fest later this year, and he could retire 
with a trophy, having been nominated for best talk-show host.

Vieira ended her five-year run on the Today show earlier this month.

The Bold and the Beautiful was named best drama at the Daytime Emmy 
awards for the third consecutive year during the ceremony.

What a peach: The honour was awarded to Laura Wright of the daytime show General Hospital

Ben Bailey of Cash Cab was named best game show host for a second year.

He was late taking the stage at the Las Vegas Hilton, admitting that he was in the bathroom when his name was called.

The
best talk show host prize was a tie between Oz Mehmet of Dr. Oz and 
Regis Philbin and Kelly Ripa of The Regis and Kelly Show.

Quiz mainstays Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune shared the Daytime Emmy for best game show.

younger actor.

The lead acting awards went to Michael Park for As the World Turns and Laura Wright for General Hospital.The
Bold and the Beautiful also won the directing award, in a tie with The 
Young and the Restless, which won the writing prize in its own right.

The
other acting prizes went to Jonathan Jackson for his supporting role in
General Hospital'and to Brittany Allen as younger actress in All My 
Children.

presentation of career achievement awards to Oprah Winfrey, and 
game-show hosts Alex Trebek and Pat Sajak.

red carpet brought out the stars at the event, which seemed more like a
bittersweet goodbye, with Oprah Winfrey, Regis Philbin, All My Children
and One Life to Live leaving the daytime airwaves.
