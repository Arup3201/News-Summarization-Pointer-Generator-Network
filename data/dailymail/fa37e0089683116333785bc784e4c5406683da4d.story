They're definitely closer to god, one way or another.

But these bizarre hanging coffins have baffled people for centuries in southern China.

The tombs - attached to mountain cliffs in Gongxian, Sichuan province - were left behind by the Bo people, believed to have died out 400 years ago.

Each coffin is made from a hollowed out single tree trunk and was originally protected by a bronze cover.

Who'd have trunk it? Each coffin is made from a hollowed out single tree trunk and was originally protected by a bronze cover

Mystery: Nobody really knows why the Bo people dealt with their dead in this way

'Some of the tombs are nearly 3,000 
years old and the most recent date back to about 1500. Nobody really 
knows why they dealt with their dead in this way,' explained one local expert.

'It is believed that they thought the gods would be able to reach them more easily like that.

'People
 say that the hanging coffins prevented bodies from being taken by 
animals and also blessed the soul for all eternity.'

For
 the past two months these ancient hanging coffins have been undergoing 
renovation – the main aim being to stabilize and restore them.

More than 40 coffins were restored and a further 16 were uncovered.

Local
 expert Lin Chan said: 'Whilst working on restoring the hanging coffins,
 a further 16 were uncovered. They are over 3,000 years old and of 
great historical significance.

'The show us a lot about how our ancestors buried their dead and what their traditions were.'

'There
 are still hundreds of hanging coffins in the region. The lowest ones 
are 10 metres above the ground and the highest 130 metres above the 
ground.

'It is very difficult work to restore them, but it is necessary. Over the past ten years at least 20 of the coffins have 
fallen and this is something we want to prevent.'

The
 Bo were an ethnic minority living outside the borders of modern day 
Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. There they created a brilliant culture as 
early as 3,000 years ago.

The
 most recent hanging coffins were made up to about 400 years ago in the 
middle and later periods of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), while many of 
the earliest ones date back 1,000 years to the Song Dynasty (960-1279).

To date, the earliest hanging coffin was one found in the Three Gorges 
area, dating back about 2,500 years to the Spring and Autumn Period (770
 BC- 476 BC).

The hanging coffin was the most widespread form of burial in ancient southwest China.

However, the practice ended with the mysterious disappearance of the Bo People.
