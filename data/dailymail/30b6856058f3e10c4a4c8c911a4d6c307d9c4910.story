Two months after he was acquitted of a domestic assault charge, former Washington Redskins defensive back Fred Smoot revealed in a candid interview that it was his jilted girlfriend who left him bleeding during a fight over car keys.

Smoot, 35, was arrested last November in Virginia after his ex-girlfriend, Valerie Jackson, accused him of attacking her when she asked to borrow his truck.

Jackson later claimed that she believed Smoot wanted to keep her from seeing boxes of condoms and generic Viagra pills inside his vehicle.

Allegations: Valerie Jackson claimed in November that Smooth busted through the bathroom door and attacked her after she asked to use his truck to go to work 

The 'he said, she said' case made national headlines after Jackson posted a series of photos on her Instagram documenting her injuries allegedly caused by her 5-foot-11, 192-pound football player boyfriend.

In January, a judge in Virginia acquitted Smoot of misdemeanor domestic assault.

During the bench trial, Smoot did admit to kicking down a bathroom door in an effort to retrieve a set of car keys from Jackson.

On Wednesday, the former Redskins player sat down for an exclusive interview with Fox5 to address the domestic violence allegations and the fallout from the scandal.

Looking sharp in a grey vest and matching tie, Fred Smoot told the station that by November 2014, his four-month relationship with Valerie Jackson had ended, but he let her stay in his Ashburn, Virginia, home until she could afford to get a place of her own.

Jackson had previously claimed that on November 23, an enraged Fred Smoot busted through the bathroom door to grab his car keys out of her hands and attack her.

While Smoot admitted that the dispute did start over the keys, he claimed he had no intention of harming Jackson.

‘So what I did was step back and I kicked the door and put a little hole in it, and opened the door and got my keys from it,’ Smoot said. ‘After I realized I had broken my door, I went and tore the stuff off so I could take the door down to put a new door up.’

Smoot also addressed his ex-girlfriends infamous Instagram photos showing blood on her gums and bruises on her arms, which she claimed were the handiwork of her boyfriend.

Infidelity rumors: Jackson suggested Smoot did not want her to see the generic Viagra and condoms he had in his car. But Smoot claims they had broken up before the November fight, and Valerie was upset that he was seeing other women 

In Smoot's retelling of the story, however, it was he who was left bloodied as a result of the confrontation.

The 35-year-old athlete pointed out that in the photo Jackson's teeth are intact, suggesting that she was not struck in the face like she had claimed, but rather that the blood seen along her gum line came from biting him.

‘She bit me on the neck so bad that when I went to CBS and stuff, the makeup artist used to have to brush it out so it couldn't be seen,’ Smoot alleged.

Smoot also denied ever choking and striking Jackson, or being verbally abusive towards her, but conceded that the couple did get into 'arguments.'

According to Fred Smoot, Jackson was jealous that he had started dating other women and concocted the domestic abuse accusations to hurt him.

‘She wanted her ten seconds of fame and she got it,’ he stated.

Smoot stressed that unlike other football players who have been caught in ugly domestic violence scandals over the past few years, he was the victim in this case.

‘Everybody kind of looked at it [and went], “Ah, here goes another football player doing the same thing,"’ he said. ‘Well, I want to let them know: “No, this is not another football player. This is the flipside of this.’

Smoot was suspended from local TV and radio jobs as a football analyst following his arrest in November, but he is hopeful about the future.

‘I just want people to know I've never touched a woman. I never will touch a woman. I want to get back doing what I love,’ he said. ‘That is TV, that's radio, that's talking sports, that's talking football, that's making people laugh, that's what I like to do.’

The footballer, who retired from the NFL in 2009, was caught up in another scandal when he played for the Minnesota Vikings back in 2006.

Smoot and some fellow players were alleged to have chartered a boat to party with prostitutes in what became known as the Love Boat Scandal.

At one point someone claimed he used a double-headed dildo on two of the women in front of the boat's crew.

He was ultimately fined by the Vikings for his alleged actions and for being the ringleader behind the outing.
