Stoke City have launched a new initiative to establish a series of Academy partnerships across North America.

The Potters have announced a new link with sports management company Global Image Sports to work with a number of youth clubs across the United States and Canada.

Each partner club's coaches and players will have the opportunity to work with Stoke's Academy coaches in both the US and UK.

Stoke Academy Director Dave Wright said: 'We are looking forward to working with Global Image Sports and bringing our Academy to North America.

'The globalisation of the game in recent years and in particular the growth in North America makes this an exciting project for Stoke City and our Academy.'

Chief executive Tony Scholes said: 'Our partnership is a fantastic opportunity for us to raise the club's profile in North America, where football is becoming increasingly popular and where we already have strong links thanks to having the likes of Geoff Cameron and Brek Shea on our books.'
