The Japanese division of lingerie maker Triumph International has unveiled an 'Abenomics' bra, a special edition it says offers a 'growth strategy' and a potential lift towards Japan's elusive inflation target.

Launches of Triumph's concept bras in Tokyo have become a regular event over the past quarter of a century and are an important publicity tool for the 127-year-old, Swiss-headquartered company.

The latest 'Branomics Bra" follows earlier solar-powered, recycled and 'husband-hunting' models but, like its predecessors, will not go on sale.

Triumph has created a brassiere that features a rising trendline and arrows as motifs and promises a 2 per cent increase in volume with extra padding

The 'Branomics Bra' is a playful take on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's 'three-arrow' economic revival plan that combines monetary strategy aiming to reach 2 per cent inflation in two years and pro-growth reforms.

It features a rising trendline and arrows as motifs and promises a 2 per cent increase in volume with extra padding.

'We hope that, as the Japanese economy grows, we can also help bust sizes to get bigger,' said Triumph spokeswoman Keiko Masuda.

Its benefits for Japan's policymakers were less clear.

Meanwhile, Japan's Nikkei surged above 14,000 for the first time in nearly five years today.

The index jumped 2.8 per cent to break the benchmark for the first time since June 2008 after aggressive new policies to try to revive the stagnant economy.

The Nikkei was up 389.22 points by the midday break after closing for public holidays on Friday and Monday.

Of the 65 Nikkei companies that have reported quarterly earnings so far, 54 per cent of them either beat or met market expectations, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine.

Japan's economy was helped by the yen weakening further against the U.S. dollar, which was a boost for the export market.

It has weakened 22 per cent against the dollar since mid-November, while the Nikkei has jumped 63 per cent after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe began promising to revive the economy.

His expansionary monetary and fiscal policies were dubbed 'Abenomics' during his election campaign.

Last month, the Bank of Japan announced a radical monetary expansion campaign that doubled the money supply.

A rise in export sales, particularly to the U.S. and China, also boosted the Nikkei companies.

Japanese exporters led the rally, with 
Toyota Motor Corp, Sony Corp, semiconductor equipment maker Tokyo 
Electron Ltd and Suzuki Motor Corp up between 4.5 and 6 per cent.

The yen has further weakened against the U.S. dollar, which will also help exporters

Sony was the most traded stock on the main board by turnover, while Toyota took third spot.

Stefan Worrall, director of equity cash sales at Credit Suisse, said Tuesday's rally mirrored the trend in overseas markets in the last few days while Japan was on holiday and may not last the rest of the week.

'The question is "where to now?",' Worrall said. 'We still have the majority of corporate earnings to come through in the next two weeks.'

JPMorgan said it expected the Nikkei to trade around 14,150 based on the correlation between the yen/won exchange rate and Tokyo index.

The yen hit a more than five-year low of 11.0057 won on Tuesday.  

Elsewhere, the FTSE 100 was 6.7 points ahead at 6528, following a strong performance from Asian markets.

Last week, the European Central Bank cut interest rates to an all-time low of 0.50 per cent which have encouraged the markets.
