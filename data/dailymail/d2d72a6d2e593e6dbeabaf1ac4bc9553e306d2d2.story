Five members of a Vermont family assaulted police officers during a melee that erupted when security guards at a New Hampshire amusement park told them to leave their knives in the car.

The fracas started at about 1:30 p.m. Monday when the Perry family tried to enter Canobie Lake Park in Salem.

Some of the family members had knives on their belts and were told they couldn't bring them into the park, police said.

Ashley Perry, 20, of Sutton was charged with disorderly conduct and criminal trespass. Allan Perry, 45, of Lyndon faces felony charges of rioting and second-degree assault, as well as disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and criminal trespass. He also was held on $5,000 cash bail.

Cash out: Joshua Perry was held overnight on $5,000 cash bail. He faces a felony charge of rioting, resisting arrest with serious injury resulting, criminal trespass and disorderly conduct

The family became belligerent and eventually two Salem officers responded to quell the disturbance.

The family became more irate, yelling profanities at the officers in front of other visitors, police said.

After several verbal warnings, an officer told one man he was under arrest and tried to handcuff him, leading to the fight that included people jumping on the backs of the officers, punching, kicking and grabbing for their weapons, police said.

Two officers were injured, including one who was treated at a hospital for a dislocated shoulder.

As backup officers arrived, the mother of the family faked a seizure, police said. She was examined by paramedics and released at the scene.

Those arrested included Joshua Perry, 23, of Sutton, Vermont, who was charged with felony riot, resisting arrest with serious injury, trespassing and disorderly conduct. He was held on $5,000 cash bail.

Brian Perry, 18, of Lyndonville, was charged with felony riot, assault and resisting arrest. He was held on $5,000 cash bail.

E. Allen Perry, 45, of Lyndon, was charged with felony riot, felony assault, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. He was held on $5,000 cash bail.

Fun of the fair: Canobie Lake Park is in Salem, New Hampshire, United States, about 40 miles north of Boston, Massachusetts. The century old amusement park has over 100 rides, games and attractions
