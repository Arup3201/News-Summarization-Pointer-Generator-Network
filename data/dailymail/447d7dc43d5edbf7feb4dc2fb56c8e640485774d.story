Killer: Marshall Lee Gore, 49, has been granted a last minute stay of execution in Miami

A murderer on Death Row in Florida has been granted a stay of execution just one hour before he was supposed to receive a lethal injection - after his lawyers claimed he is insane.

Marshall Lee Gore, 49, a former escort service owner who strangled and stabbed exotic dancer Robyn Novick to death in 1988, was supposed to be put to death in Miami at 6pm on Monday. He has also been convicted of a second murder.

But a federal appeals court temporarily halted the execution at the last minute and a court date has been set for Thursday for his lawyers to explore the possibility that he is insane.

The stay came after Gore enjoyed his 
'last' meal of a rib-eye steak and a Coca-Cola. He did not touch his 
side of a baked potato, the Miami Herald reported.

The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, which is based in Atlanta, said it would try to settle the matter before July 1, the newspaper added.

Gore's attorneys have previously argued that he is mentally ill, and one lawyer claimed he was 'mentally deranged' and not responsible for his actions. During his trials, he had frequent verbal outbursts, laughed out loud and even howled.

He has also contended that the date of his scheduled execution, June 24, 2013, adds up to 666 and that he is a target of 'Satan Worshippers who have threatened that date by mail for years'.

But Gore has no significant history of mental illness and last month a panel of psychiatrists found that he was mentally sound.

They said that Gore claimed that the 'Illuminati' wanted him dead to sell his organs - a story they say he made up to manipulate the judicial process.

'This fantastic, imaginative scenario was patently a fabrication designed
to mislead the panel and avoid responsibility for his past actions,' 
the panel told the governor.

Relatives of Novick, who had traveled from Ohio to witness the execution, were devastated, the Herald reported. The family of Susan Marie Roark, another of Gore's victims, was also present.

'They're upset,' said retired Lt. Neal Nydam, who was with the Roark family. 'This has been going on for 25 years. They're trying to find closure and it's not going to happen today.'

Gore first kidnapped a stripper named Tina in March 1988, raped her, slit her throat and hit her across the head with a rock before leaving her to die in a rural area.

But she survived and managed to alert police. Gore had also stolen her car - and her two-year-old son in the back seat. He was later found alive locked in a cabinet of an abandoned home in Georgia.

While officers were searching for the boy, they found Novick's body. The 30-year-old had met Gore while working as a dancer in North Miami-Dade.

Gore was tracked down to Kentucky. When he was found, he had Tina's woman's bank and credit cards in his jacket pocket, according to court documents.

Police also identified him as the person
who killed Roark. She had last been seen with Gore before vanishing in 
April 1988. Her body was found off a rural forest road.

Upon questioning about all three crimes and shown pictures of Novick's body, police said his eyes filled with tears and he said: 'If I did this, I deserve the death penalty.'

Gore initially denied knowing any of the women, according to police. But he later testified that all three women worked for him at his escort service.

In 1995, he was found guilty of Novick's murder and sent to Death Row. Gov. Scott signed the death warrant last month. His death would have been the state's third execution of the month.
