A hotel in Germany are offering a 'captivating' stay - by locking up their guests in old prison cells.

The Alcatraz hotel in Kauserslautern was once a fully functioning prison which has now been transformed into a modern guest house with a twist.

The 56 rooms at the hotel offers a night behind bars, complete with a stripy prison pyjamas to give its willing inmates the full experience.

Captivating: The outside of the former prison, now known as Alcatraz Hotel, where guests can stay in cells

Locked up: Looking through the peephole into of one of the cell rooms where guests can experience what life is like behind bars - with some modification

'Prisoners' at the hotel can find out firsthand what life was like inside the dingy cells, with the helping hand of a few modern necessities thrown in.

Receptionist David Woodard, 23, says: ‘Dr. Michael Koll and Dr. Andreas Kirsch bought the former prison and had the idea to change it into a hotel in 2007, five years after it closed.

‘The decision was made for the prison to be fused with a bigger one further away, and my managers had the idea to turn it into a hotel, but wanted to keep some of the authenticity of the prison.’

A night in the cells would set you back just £41 for a single room, whilst a double costs £58 for the complete experience.

Originally built in 1867, the prison was soon enlarged and more and more structures like working halls, cellars, outside grounds and a chapel were added.

Safety first: Although the old prison was transformed into a hotel in 2007, it has kept a fair few of its original features, including the cage reception

It's all black and white: The hotel sees guests don striped pyjamas to really get into the spirit of their stay

Prison feel: The hotel has kept the bars on the window of the old cells

Dead man walking: Despite the warm colour scheme, the hallways have a distinct prison-like feel

‘The people who come here for the experience of a prison hotel have given us very positive feedback in the aspects of authenticity and hospitality,’ said David.

‘Guests who have the time to participate in a tour are amazed; they get to see the old not yet refurnished parts of the prison, which includes three levels of cells.’

It took 18 months to complete the transformation from prison to hotel, which features cells, comfort rooms and suits, as well as a restaurant and meeting room.

Dark history: Now an inviting hotel, the prison, originally built in 1867, did not close for inmates until 2002

Lock and key: Although the hotel features 56 modern 'rooms' there are three levels of cells which have not yet been refurnished and still looks the way it did in its prison days
