The grandparents of tragic young girl Chloe Valentine have slammed Families SA, saying they could have prevented the death of their four-year-old granddaughter.

Speaking to ABC's 7.30 program ahead of the final day of the inquest into Chloe's death, Belinda Valentine and her partner said the social workers 'absolutely' failed in their duty of care over the young girl.

Chloe died in 2012 from head injuries sustained after being forced to ride a motorbike three times her weight for days on end by her drug addicted mother Ashley Polkinghorne and her partner at the time.

Her mother, Ashlee Polkinghorne, 22, and Polkinghorne's then-partner Benjamin McPartland, 28, are in jail after pleading guilty to Chloe's manslaughter through criminal neglect. 

But Belinda Valentine, like so many others, said Chloe's life could have been saved had Families SA intervened, or took Ms Valentine up on her offer of taking the youngster into her care.

'From when Chloe was a tiny infant we offered and offered in fact at times we begged,' the grandmother told the ABC.

'We contacted Families SA on a regular basis and told them our concerns and they weren't everyday concerns, these were concerns that were valid, they were serious, and they just weren't taken in that way,' Ms Valentine added.

The grandmother recalled an incident in 2009 when she was called by her daughter Ashley after she had been beaten by her boyfriend at the time.

Ms Valentine said she found Chloe cowering and terrified, and she called a social worker - Leanne Stewart - from the house with the young girl still in her arms.

Belinda Valentine said she repeatedly begged authorities to take Chloe off her parents and into her care

'I told her what we would like to do and she said to me you can't tell Ashley where she should live and you have no right to take Chloe, I'm not giving you permission to take Chloe at all.

'Ashley just laughed at us. And I said to her look, I want to speak to your supervisor, I need to speak to someone higher than you and she said 'I am the supervisor',' Ms Valentine revealed.

However Ms Stewart has denied in court that this conversation even took place.

Chloe's grandmother also revealed the heartbreak of watching footage of Chloe fall off the motorbike sustaining injuries which would later lead to her death.

'To see her alive, but in the last few hours of her life was, it was heartbreaking.

'And to hear Ashley's manic laughter, and to see Ben throw her onto the motorbike and her crashing, you just don't want to go there, you don't want to think about she must have been thinking and feeling without anyone there to protect her,' Ms Valentine told the ABC through tears. 

Ms Valentine said she called social worker Leanne Stewart from the scene of a domestic dispute pleading to take Chloe away from Ashley

The inquest into Chloe's death with be finalised on Friday

A veteran social worker also told the program he believed 'without a doubt' Chloe could have been saved, if Families SA hadn't failed the toddler.

Tony Tonkin said he could not recall an inquest of this depth or length during his time, and said he was deeply saddened by her story. 

Earlier this week during the inquest - which will come to a head on Friday - the head of Families SA said social workers missed opportunities to save Chloe.

Department for Education and Child Development chief executive Tony Harrison said the young girl's case workers had placed too much weight on preserving family unity at the expense of ensuring the girl's safety, in the years leading to her death.

'There was a very, very strong emphasis to, at all costs, keep the family together,' he told the inquest into Chloe's death on Tuesday.

'With the benefit of hindsight, we would have to wonder whether we persisted with that approach for too long.

At an inquest into her death on Tuesday authorities said social workers missed the chance to save Chloe Valentine, 4, who died of massive head injuries in 2012

The young girl was forced to ride a motorbike for days on end by her drug addicted mother and her partner

'We have to be prepared, at the right time as we determine it, to take a strong intervention because that's needed to keep children alive.'

The inquest has heard Chloe was forced to endure chronic neglect at the hands of her drug-using teenage mother but was never removed by Families SA.

Chloe was four when she died of massive head injuries after being forced to ride a motorbike that repeatedly crashed over a three-day period in the backyard of her Adelaide home in January 2012.

Polkinghorne and McPartland waited more than eight hours before calling an ambulance after Chloe eventually became unconscious. 

A comprehensive review of Chloe's case had made clear that a 'circuit-breaker' was needed to save the girl from the chaos in her life

Mr Harrison, a former SA Police assistant commissioner who became head of the DECD in July 2013, said he strongly supported keeping families together and building the capability of parents within the child protection system.

But a comprehensive review of Chloe's case had made clear that a 'circuit-breaker' was needed to save the girl from the chaos in her life.

'The question should have been asked as early as 2008 as to whether the removal of Chloe was appropriate,' he said.

'It seemed like we missed opportunities to consider the option of removing the child from the environment.'

The coroner has asked why Chloe's mother Ashley was repeatedly given the benefit of the doubt

Families SA received 20 child abuse notifications during Chloe's short life from witnesses concerned about the girl's filthy, transient and unsafe living conditions

Families SA received 20 child abuse notifications during Chloe's short life from witnesses concerned about the girl's filthy, transient and unsafe living conditions, her mother's drug use and her exposure to domestic violence in the family home.

State Coroner Mark Johns has questioned why Polkinghorne was often given the benefit of the doubt by social workers, who helped clean her house and avoided confronting her about her drug use.

Mr Harrison admitted there was potential for social workers to be compromised by their intimate involvement in a case.

'There can be some blurring of objectivity as social workers build relationships with families,' he said.

The inquest continues.
