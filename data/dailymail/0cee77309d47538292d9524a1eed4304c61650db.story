A serial party pest had his party shut down by the police who were then bottled by upset revellers.

Perth Now reported police were forced to break up an out-of-control party in Bentley on Saturday night when 200 people spilled out into the streets.

Martin Fulton, 16, said he arranged the party, but neighbours labelled him a serial party pest as he was always having parties there. Fulton had invited over 500 people on Facebook to the party. He even charged an entry fee – $5 entry before 8pm, $10 anytime after this, plus ones $10. 

When 30 police officers moved in to shut the party down they were bottled by revellers. 'It was fine until the cops showed up, then they ruined it,' Fulton said.

Fulton said he registered the party online, told neigbours and hired bouncers. 

When asked why the police were bottled, Fulton replied it was because they were trying to 'shut down a  good party'. He said that what happened would not stop him from holding other parties in the future, and the next one would be on New Year's Eve.

Thirty police officers descended on the party to help restore order

Police were called to the scene on Gambar Court just before midnight following reports of people fighting. When officers arrived, there were an estimated 200 people at the address.

Police entered the property and removed several people, while declaring it an 'out of control gathering.' A 20-year-old man allegedly refused to comply with police instructions and he was charged with obstruct police and disorderly conduct.
