Report: David Nicholson was in control of the strategic health authority responsible for supervising Stafford Hospital between 2005 and 2006

As a young NHS trainee at the height of the Cold War, David Nicholson idolised Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev.

At the same time as starting work in a mental health unit he joined the Communist Party in 1977.

He was no ordinary revolutionary. He was on the hardline, so-called ‘Tankie’ wing of the party which backed the Kremlin using military action to crush dissident uprisings.

Today, David Nicholson is the £270,000-a year chief executive of the NHS.

The one-time radical who used to regard political honours as elitist symbols of bourgeoisie government was happy to be knighted in 2010.

Nicknamed the ‘Big Beast’ of the NHS because of his abrasive management style, his rise up the management ladder saw him take control of the strategic health authority responsible for supervising Stafford Hospital between 2005 and 2006.

It was during this period that patients needlessly died because of appalling standards of care.

Today’s damning report into the scandal could yet bring an end to his career – during which he forced through the last Labour government’s controversial ‘target culture’ that fatally undermined the ethos of care that has traditionally been a hallmark of NHS hospitals.

It has been a remarkable journey for a man who was a Communist for six years until his membership lapsed in 1983.

Critics say that the ‘uncaring culture’ that has developed in some aspects of healthcare can be likened to the one that prevailed during the godless Soviet regimes.

But Nicholson, 57, won’t discuss his Communist past.

The NHS chief was brought up in Nottingham – his father was crippled with emphysema and confined to a wheelchair. This tragic experience inculcated in his son the importance of the principle of an NHS free at the point of delivery.

It’s not clear if he abandoned Communism to further his career, or because his views mellowed. But one thing is certain: Nicholson has always done his political masters’ bidding.

As chief executive of Doncaster Royal Infirmary in the 1990s, when the Major government was in power, he was part of one of the first health trusts to break away from the control of Whitehall, amid fierce opposition from Labour and the unions.

Damning: The report into Mid Staffordshire Trust could bring an end to Nicholson's career

After a series of senior regional posts, in 2006 he became NHS chief executive under Prime Minister Tony Blair.

Nicholson was expected to quit when the Tory-led Coalition came to power in 2010, but he was given additional responsibilities. However, his stewardship of the NHS since the election has been mired in controversy.

He refused to cancel a major NHS IT project which became a monument to Whitehall folly when it was clear that costs were out of control. Eventually it was cancelled at a loss to the taxpayer of £12.7billion.

Nicholson was appointed as NHS chief executive under Tony Blair, and David Cameron is the third prime minister he has served

Despite such a scandalous waste of money, Nicholson escaped blame and still enjoys the confidence of David Cameron (the third PM he’s served).

Not all Tories, though, are so impressed. MP Steve Barclay, a member of the Commons Public Accounts committee, says:  ‘We had a major NHS IT programme that went spectacularly wrong. David Nicholson was the accounting officer. What scale of blunder do you have to make before you are held accountable for failure?’

Similar questions have been asked of his role in the Coalition’s botched Health Reform Bill. There were a series of anonymous and particularly poisonous briefings from within the Department of Health about the then Health Secretary Andrew Lansley’s handling of the legislation.

In due course, the draft bill was postponed after it was deemed to be confused and overly complex.

Nicholson remained in post while Lansley was replaced as Health Secretary.

Within weeks, Nicholson was warning that ‘high-profile, politically-driven changes almost always end in misery and disaster’. These comments broke the Whitehall convention that civil servants criticise policy only in private, not in public. But Nicholson is a law unto himself. ‘No one crosses him. He’s like a ruthless omnipotent medieval Pope,’ said one senior official.

Incidentally, relations between Nicholson and Lansley had never recovered after the minister spotted the civil service chief travelling first class by train to a conference when Lansley himself was going to the same meeting, but in second class.

But then Nicholson loves travelling first class. On Saturday, the Mail disclosed that he racked up nearly £6,000 in 41 first-class train tickets in a year to Birmingham.

Each time he claimed to have been ‘attending official meetings’ but, in fact, they were held via video-conferencing, meaning he could have taken part from anywhere in the country. MPs have indicated that they will ask Nicholson to justify the expenditure.

Wife: Nicholson got engaged in 2009 to Sarah-Jane Marsh, the chief executive of Birmingham Children's Hospital

Many of the trips spanned ‘long weekends’, prompting speculation he was going to his see his new young wife at their home in Birmingham.

Divorced with two grown-up sons, Nicholson had earlier got engaged in 2009 to Sarah-Jane Marsh, the chief executive of Birmingham Children’s Hospital.

It was not just the 22-year age gap which caused consternation. It was also the fact Nicholson met her while she was seconded to his office as a junior.

Nicholson has told NHS trusts to deliver between £15billion and £20billion in efficiency savings before 2014

Nicholson, then director of Health and Social Care for the Midlands and East of England, took a shine to the attractive graduate trainee, acting as her mentor.

He also gave her two job references – the second leading to her appointment as chief operating officer at Birmingham Children’s Hospital. She was in the job when the Health Care Commission delivered a devastating report over a catalogue of patient failures at the hospital.

Two years later, despite the criticism, she became chief executive on a £155,000 salary, at the relatively youthful age of 32. By this time she was engaged to Nicholson – the all-powerful head of the NHS.

For his part, Nicholson has told NHS trusts to deliver between £15billion and £20billion in efficiency savings before 2014 (the equivalent of to up to 6 per cent of the current NHS budget).

Meanwhile, his own personal spending included £155,000 worth of expenses in four years. His annual expenses for his plush London flat was triple the MPs’ second homes allowance.

He gave up the property on condition that taxpayers covered any hotel bills incurred and despite the fact he chose to live in Birmingham. He also has a chauffeur-driven car.

How ironic if this former Communist party member’s downfall was triggered not by the tragic effects of the ‘target culture’ he ruthlessly enforced which contributed to the fiasco at Stafford, but if he was censured by a committee of MPs for using taxpayers’ money on his lavish expenses.
