Neymar and James Rodriguez have been two of the stars of this 
magnificent tournament, but while one of them could go on to be a 
national icon, the other will be going home early.

If
 Friday's match between Brazil and Colombia is settled by anybody, it 
will most likely be one of these two with a piece of football magic.

Before last year’s Confederations Cup, Neymar looked like a showboater but something special happens to him in that yellow Brazil shirt.

At Barcelona he’s like a little boy, playing in the shadow of Lionel Messi. At this tournament, with the weight of an entire nation on his shoulders, he has been majestic.

We all know about Neymar’s skill but I have been surprised by his work ethic. I have never seen a footballer walk about the pitch as much as Messi but he gets away with it because of his genius.

With Neymar, it’s more of an all-action display. He is always on the move, playing up front, off the striker, out wide. He gives everything for his team in attack and defence and at times has almost been like their captain.

Rodriguez is a more languid, laid-back player. He has the perfect 
build for a footballer with great footballing intelligence, too.

His 
volley against Uruguay was one of the goals of the tournament. He 
demonstrated his awareness before the ball came to him by having two 
quick looks over his shoulder to find the space. It’s that extra time on
 the ball that marks out great players.

It 
normally takes years to build that kind of confidence so to see it in 
one as young as Rodriguez — he’s only 22 — is special and to be a goal 
ahead of Messi, Neymar and Thomas Muller at the World Cup is 
exceptional.

He and Neymar are both brilliant to watch. Let’s hope they put on one last show tonight before one of them has to go home.
