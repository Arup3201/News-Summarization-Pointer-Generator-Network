The 34-year-old scored 26 goals in 186 games for Stoke, having previously played for Swansea City and Gillingham and played 30 minutes in a development game this week.

'Mamady has been on my radar for a number of years. He's always impressed me with his mentality and attitude.

'He's not prolific in terms of goal-scoring, but he does affect the game.'
