Roy Hodgson is set to unleash England’s young stars on Brazil 2014 by announcing an exciting World Cup squad tomorrow that is expected to include Everton’s Ross Barkley.

With Southampton’s Adam Lallana, Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling and Jordan Henderson, and Arsenal’s Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all set to make the cut as well, there will be a clutch of young and relatively inexperienced players in the World Cup squad for this summer.

Barkley, 20, looks to be in, although Hodgson is leaving the biggest selection dilemma — whether to go for Southampton’s 18-year-old  prodigy, Luke Shaw, or 33-year-old Chelsea veteran Ashley Cole — until the last minute.

Bright future: Everton's Ross Barkley appears to have earned himself a place in England's World Cup squad

Talent: Raheem Sterling, pictured here in action against Denmark, has shone for Liverpool this season

Shaw is more likely to get the nod and that would represent an even bolder statement of faith in the future.

Everton’s
 John Stones, who is 19, Cardiff’s  Steven Caulker (22) and Liverpool’s 
Jon Flanagan (21) are being considered as stand-by players, while 
32-year-old Michael Carrick, of Manchester United, looks as though he 
will be the major casualty, just failing to make the 23-man squad.

The
 rise this season of Liverpool and Southampton, two teams playing superb
 attacking football with young English players integral to their  
success, has been welcomed by  critics.

Gary
 Lineker, a former England captain and the World Cup Golden Boot winner 
at Mexico in 1986, said: ‘Six months ago we thought, “Oh, we’re really 
struggling”. But since then Sturridge has proved to be a top-class 
scorer with a bit of confidence or arrogance.

Catching the eye: Southampton's Adam Lallana has impressed in his three caps for England

On the run: Jack Wilshere should be fit for selection after breaking his foot against Denmark in March

Hodgson's choice for first game vs Italy

'You’ve got Lallana, who 
can play in midfield or as one of two wide players, Sterling, who is a 
tremendously exciting young talent, and  Barkley and Henderson.

‘A
 lot of credit must go to Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool and Mauricio 
Pochettino at Southampton.

'They have given the players belief and told 
them how good they are, instead of telling them what is wrong with their
 game. And it has had a really good effect, because they can all play.’

Former
 England captain Alan Shearer believes Barkley has the ability to repeat
 the impact his own strike partner — then just 18 — had at the 1998 
World Cup in France.

‘It 
has echoes of Michael Owen in ’98 and the way he was put on to that 
stage — he could produce something like Michael did in France,’ said 
Shearer.

One young player 
likely to be disappointed is Tottenham defender Kyle Walker. England 
medics are due to visit Spurs today to make a final assessment on his 
pelvic injury and it is thought unlikely he will be picked. But United’s
 Phil Jones may be given the benefit of the doubt. His shoulder ligament
 damage looks as though it will have healed by  England’s opening game 
against Italy on June 14.

Been there, done that: Wayne Rooney will be one of Hodgson's most experienced players in Brazil

Veterans: Frank Lampard (left) should be included in the final squad, but Ashley Cole (right) might miss out

Captain fantastic: Steven Gerrard, now 33, will skipper the Three Lions in South America

More to come: Alan Shearer believes Everton starlet Barkley could shine like Michael Owen did at the 1998 World Cup

Decision time: England boss Roy Hodgson will name his 23-man squad for Brazil on Monday

Danger man: Daniel Sturridge (centre), pictured here celebrating his goal against Denmark, will be one of Hodgson's main attacking threats

Versatile: Hodgson is a fan of Danny Welbeck's ability to play out wide and through the middle
