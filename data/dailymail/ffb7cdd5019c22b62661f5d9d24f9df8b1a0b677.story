Announcement: Justine Greening, pictured, announced an additional pledge of £50m to warn-torn Somalia today

Britain will spend a further £120million on aid to war-torn Somalia after ministers agreed to back a three-year European Union reconstruction plan.

Brussels is providing £545million for a scheme designed to bolster security and build an inclusive political system. The UK will contribute £70million.

European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said Brussels would give 650million euros - around £545million.

Around one eighth of this - £70million - will be paid for by UK taxpayers.

Separately, International Development Secretary Justine Greening announced a further £50million to treat 8,400 children for malnutrition and provide life-saving immunisations for 5,300 babies.

It brings the total amount of money given to Somalia since 2008 by the European Union (EU) to £1.2 billion.

Half of the £50million announced by Ms Greening will go towards boosting Somalia's economic development by supporting the country's recovery plan.

It will include investment in infrastructure, sanitation, agriculture and jobs.

Today, Ms Greening said: 'Britain is already forging a new and special relationship with Somalia.

'It is right that we help Somalia to get back on its feet and stop the country falling back into the arms of terrorism, famine and insecurity.

'This new roadmap for reconstruction is a once in a generation opportunity to support Somalia's plans for a safer and more prosperous future.

'We must give ordinary Somalis the support they need to make this a reality.'

Aid: The money will be used to treat thousands of malnourished Somali children, the Department for International Development (DfID) have said

It comes just weeks after it emerged that £480,000 of British aid and supplies to Somalia was confiscated by al-Qaeda terrorists in the country.

Oxfam’s head of policy Max Lawson welcomed the extra cash, but said governments should be doing more not to close bank accounts that allow Somalis to send money from abroad worth a quarter of the country’s economy - and dwarfing the amount of foreign aid.

Somalia was plunged into decades of lawlessness after the overthrow of President Siad Barre in 1991.

Militant group Al-Shabab is currently fighting to remove Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud's government - the first to be recognised by the US in more than 20 years.

The group controls most of the southern part of the country. However, it has been driven out of the main cities and towns - including the capital Mogadishu - by an African Union (AU) force backing the government.
