He was one of the most famous racehorses in British history, winning 36 races before retiring in 1824.

And now archaeologists believe they may have discovered the skeleton of the legendary 19th century stallion Doctor Syntax.

The remains were found during excavations at the former royal stables of Palace House, one of the homes of King Charles II, in Newmarket, Suffolk.

Experts said the skeleton is almost completely intact and measures the same height as the famous horse.

He was put down in 1838 but his exact resting place was never known despite his historic past.

Historians at the National Horseracing Museum  said it was possible they have finally found his body during the excavation for the new National Heritage Centre for Horseracing and Sporting Art.

Curator Graham Snelling said: 'A member of the public told us he had read that Doctor Syntax was buried at Newmarket Palace House stables.

'Then, when the skeleton was discovered, it was a potential possibility.

'Where it was buried, it would make sense. Doctor Syntax was euthanised here in 1838.

'It was a very careful digger driver that spotted the skeleton. It would be an amazing find if it turned out to be Doctor Syntax.

'He was one of most consistent racehorses of his time. He went to stud here in 1824. He was a good sire as well as a great racehorse.

The racehorse was born in Yorkshire 1811 and won more than 36 races from 1814 to 1823 before retirement 

'It could also be a royal racehorse. Its location does not suggest it wasn't. It is very exciting. It makes you think what else is there to find.'

Archaeologist Chris Faine, of Oxford Archaeology, said he was not convinced the skeleton was that of Doctor Syntax due to the age of the horse's teeth.

The horse is believed to have been 28 when he died but Mr Faine puts the mystery horse at 18 to 20 years old after examining its teeth.

He said: 'There's no trace of any other injuries on the skeleton. The skull was heavily smashed, which means I can't tell from it whether it was euthanised.

'I'm told that the preferred method from that period was a medium gauge shotgun behind the ear which wouldn't have done the skull lot of good anyway. It's more than possible it was put to sleep.

'It was certainly a racehorse, all the evidence points to that. I don't think it could be Doctor Syntax, but you would have to carry out DNA tests to make sure.

'It was in a specifically dug grave and was not just manhandled in. It could be a royal racehorse, but it is impossible to say for sure. It was carefully buried.'

He revealed the racehorse was born in Yorkshire 1811 and won more than 36 races from 1814 to 1823. 

Mr Snelling, who has been at the museum for 22 years, said he could not say whether it would become an exhibit and would consider carrying out a DNA test.

He welcomed anyone who has further information that could shed light on the identity of the horse to get in touch.

The first royal residence in Newmarket was built in 1608 by James I who found the nearby heath land ideal for horse racing and the first race was recorded in 1622.

But racing was  suppressed during the Commonwealth Period as a calculated political act because race meetings were seen as an unwelcome opportunity for royalist gatherings.

Shortly after the Restoration, Charles II had the stables repaired or rebuilt by John Bayspoole in around 1664. 

The Palace House Stables stand opposite what remains of the racing palace of Charles II. 

Charles II established the Town Plate in October 1665 which is still run to this day. 

The King actually rode in the race himself, winning in both 1671 and 1675. 

He appointed Robert Baynton as his Keeper of the Running Horses at Newmarket.

The majority of Charles II's complex was demolished early in the 19th century and 'building materials' were advertised in local newspapers.

A new National Heritage Centre for Horseracing and Sporting Art is currently being built at the site.
