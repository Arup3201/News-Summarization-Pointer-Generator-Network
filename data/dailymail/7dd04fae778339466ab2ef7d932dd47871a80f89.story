Luis Suarez began the final countdown to his long awaited debut for Barcelona by scoring twice in a specially-arranged friendly against an Indonesia Under 19 XI.

A Barca B team XI won the game 6-0 with Suarez graciously giving up the chance to complete a hat-trick by allowing Maxi Rolon to take a late penalty.

One month today he will face Real Madrid in the Bernabeu and in his first full 90 minutes since the World Cup he showed he is not far off full match fitness with an energetic display capped by a goal from his first chance.

Suarez is unable to take part in La Liga matches until October 25 as a result of his ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup but can play in friendlies.

Enrique said he wanted Suarez to take part in a Barcelona B match so he could improve his 'match rhythm' ahead of his return to the first team. 

Suarez and former Ajax team-mate Thomas Vermaelen warmed up on pitch number seven at their new side's Joan Gamper training complex ahead of their appearance for Barcelona B.

The Indonesians, wearing all white, conceded inside the first few minutes when Vermaelen nodded home from close range to put his side in the lead.

Suarez also managed to get himself on the scoresheet inside the first half. Barcelona's summer signing latched onto a pass from Croatian playmaker Alen Halilovic before beating the helpless Indonesian shot stopper.

Barcelona B could have had a penalty when Suarez and Halilovic linked up superbly once again before the latter appeared to have been brought down by the Indonesian custodian.

David Babunski put his side further in the lead when the Macedonian starlet struck from 20 yards in the 27th minute.

The opening exchanges of the second half followed a similar pattern to the first with Barcelona camped in their opposition's half. Suarez and Halilovic both showed why they will play a big part in the first team by continuing to pepper Indonesia's goal. 

Vermaelen's successful first appearance for Barcelona came to an end in the 62nd minute when the Belgium international was replaced by Bicho.

It did not take long for Bicho to make an impact on the game as his first touch saw him score his side's fourth as he played a shot underneath the legs of the onrushing keeper.

Suarez added another soon after Bicho's strike when the Uruguayan, who was being cheered on by his family, curled the ball into the net. 

He had a chance to grab a hat-trick when he successfully appealed to the referee for a penalty. However he allowed his younger team-mate Rolon to score from the spot.

Former Liverpool ace Suarez looked strong throughout the 90 minutes despite his recent lack of match practice since his last competitive appearance against Italy in Brazil.

There was a pitch invasion at the end of the match from Suarez's little girl Delfina, who ran to congratulate her dad in the centre circle before the Indonesian team had their picture taken with the Barcelona No 7.

Suarez took to Twitter after the match to say he was 'grateful' of having the chance of playing with Barcelona B and that he was preparing to support his team-mates in their La Liga encounter against Malaga.
