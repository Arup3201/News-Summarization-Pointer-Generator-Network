Weddings have been put on hold in Utah after the U.S. Supreme Court halted same-sex marriages while the Denver court of appeals rules on whether the couples have the right to wed.

The temporary halt on same-sex marriages means many couples who obtained their license but had not yet held their ceremony have been forced to put their plans on hold.

It is not yet known how many have been affected by the suspension of the law on same-sex marriages, but more than 1,000 couples had taken home marriage licenses in the past two weeks.

Today Governor Gary Herbert issued guidance to state agencies 
instructing them not to recognize same-sex marriages that took place 
during the two weeks.

'State
 recognition of same-sex marital status is on hold until further 
notice,' the guidance states. 'Please understand this position is not 
intended to comment on the legal status of those same-sex marriages - 
that is for the courts to decide.'

But Mr Herbert's office also said benefits obtained by the newlyweds during the two weeks should not be revoked.

For instance, if a couple changed 
their names on a driver's license already, that license should not be 
revoked, Mr Herbert said.

But,
 since all the laws revert back to before the federal judge's December 
20 ruling, couples trying to change their name now on a driver's license
 will not be allowed to do so, he said.

Utah
 Attorney-General Sean Reyes issued his own statement, saying the 
validity of the 1,000-plus marriages performed is in question, and 
dependent on the decision of the appeals court.

One couple who have been forced to put their plans on hold is Michael Mathie and Tyler McCraley, who collected their license on December 26.

Unlike many couples who solemnized their vows in impromptu ceremonies in the lobby of county clerks offices, Mr Mathie and Mr McCraley decided to wait so Mr Mathie's two children could be involved.

They had planned to hold their ceremony this weekend, but they waited too long.

Ceremonies have been put on hold while the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals considers the long-term question of whether gay couples have a right to wed in Utah.

Joy: Cheryl Haws, right and Shelly Eyre pose with their marriage license. More than 1,000 were issued in the past two weeks but a court has now halted same-sex marriages

The ruling means couples who have not
 already solemnized the marriage won't be considered legally wed, Salt 
Lake County Clerk Sherrie Swensen said.

A marriage license itself means nothing unless there is a ceremony with an officiator and two witnesses, she said.

'We were totally devastated. The biggest push for us to get married is to show the kids we were in this for the long haul. We definitely wanted them to be a part of it,' Mr McCraley said.

County clerks have yet to tabulate how many same-sex couples who obtained licenses failed to make their unions official, but Megan Risbon of the Utah Pride Center estimates a couple of hundred people may fall into this category.

The uncertainty surrounding the marriages is emblematic of the confusion resonating throughout Utah after a two-week rush on same-sex marriages was brought to a sudden halt. Questions remain about taxes, adoptions and health insurance for the newly married couples.

'The legal landscape is changing by the minute,' attorney Laura Milliken Gray, who represents many same-sex couples, said. 'We're trying to figure out exactly what it means in an area where everything is unprecedented.'

Governor Herbert's guidance drew rebukes from attorneys representing three same-sex couples who brought the lawsuit that led to the federal judge's decision and the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah.

They believe the marriages are valid, and that the couples should be able to get benefits bestowed upon any married couple.

'Regardless of how the state believes the 10th Circuit will ultimately rule, these couples are legally married and the state should treat them accordingly,' attorney Peggy Tomsic said in a statement.

Mr McCraley, 32, said the past three weeks have triggered a roller coaster of emotions for him and other gay and lesbian couples.

First was the joy and shock that a federal judge overturned Utah's same-sex marriage ban. That was followed by the excitement of planning a wedding: renting tuxedos, ordering flowers and having a friend open her house for the event.

Then came the disappointment on Monday morning of finding out about the Supreme Court ruling and canceling their wedding ceremony in which 50 people were going to attend.

Now, they don't know when, or if, they'll ever get married in Utah.

'We're just waiting to see what happens,' Mr McCraley said.

Phones at the Utah Pride Center have been ringing steadily over the past two days with calls from couples stuck in the same situation as Mr McCraley and Mr Mathie, Ms Risbon said.

Her organization and other gay marriage proponents made sure there were plenty of marriage officials at the county clerk offices in the days after the December 20 ruling.

Ms Risbon said they were encouraging everyone to finish the process right then and there, in case a court granted the state's request for a halt.

But, some people needed or wanted more time, she said. Many were waiting to hold ceremonies until out-of-town family and friends could make it in. The family of one lesbian couple were driving from Colorado on Monday for a ceremony this week.

'It's heartbreaking,' Ms Risbon said. 'These couples waited and now they just can't.'
