A Florida couple have been arrested for having sex on a crowded beach in broad daylight and in full view of families with children.

Elissa Alvarez, 20, a waitress from Bradenton, and 39-year-old Jose 'Ben' Caballero, a fitness instructor, were taken into police custody on Cortez Beach Sunday on charges of felony lewd and lascivious exhibition.

According to a probable cause affidavit, outraged beach-goer Emily Hall called police to report that Alvarez and Caballero were lying on a beach towel next to her and fondling each other.

The witness said the couple eventually went from inappropriate touching to all-out sexual intercourse, which lasted about 25 minutes, The Smoking Gun reported.

Ms Hall told investigators she was upset by the X-rated display because her 4-year-old daughter was with her and saw everything.

The lovebirds' amorous antics were even captured on a cell phone camera by a bystander, which was later obtained by MyFox Tampa Bay.

Screenshots from the video show the 5-foot-5, 150-pound Ms Alvarez suggestively perched on top of her lover on a sun-drenched beach.

In all, Bradenton police have received seven complaints about the oversexed couple.

Alvarez and Caballero were booked into a local jail and later released on $7,500 bond. They are due back in court August 8.

Beach bum: According to her social media posts, Ms Alvarez is a constant presence of Bradenton's beaches

According to Miss Alvarez' Facebook profile, she is a constant presence on the beaches of Bradenton.

Her photo albums are filled with images of her frolicking in the sand.

'I already miss the beach!!!! Ready to wear my new bathing suite [sic] too!!!!!' her status update from July 16 proclaims.

Those present on Cortez Beach Sunday reported that after bringing their public lovemaking session to a conclusion, the couple took a dip in the ocean and then returned to the beach for a catnap, which lasted several hours.

When Alvarez and Caballero woke up, they allegedly picked up where they have left off, prompting one furious parent to confront the two.

Caught with his pants down: A bystander's phone camera captured the moment police officers arrived to handcuff the skimpily dressed lover

According to the woman who recorded the incident, the 39-year-old personal trainer became aggressive and seemed spoiling for a fight, but police officers arrived just in time to restrain him.

The bystander’s video shows the moment the 5-foot-7 bodybuilder dressed in a skimpy bathing suit was handcuffed by officers. 

‘I've lived here since 1978 and I go to the beaches and I've never seen anything like this,’ the woman who made the incriminating video told MyFox. 

For Mr Caballero, Sunday’s arrest was not his first run-in with the law.

The fitness trainer is a convicted felon who had served nearly eight years on cocaine trafficking charges.
