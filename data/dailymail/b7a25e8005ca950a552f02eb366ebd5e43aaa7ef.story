A Spanish dog breeder was left in shock when two tiny puppies were born a shade of green.

Aido Vallelado, 27, said she struggled to believe it when she first saw the colour of the two puppies.

Born smaller and weaker than the rest of the litter, one of the green puppies, a female, died shortly after birth - but the male puppy is still alive, although he is weak.

Ms Vallelado said: 'I thought the puppies were maybe dirty somehow and I tried to clean them, but the colour wouldn't come off and then I realised it was the colour of their fur.'

Molina, who breeds hunting dogs with her father Manuel Vallelado, 52, in the Spanish town of Laguna de Duero, said her father had called the puppies the Hulk pups, and joked that she should not get them angry.

The male puppy is now gradually beginning to lose his colouring.

Vet Daniel Valverde is now looking into the cause of death of the female puppy and the dogs' colour.

He said: 'There are no other recorded cases of this happening in Spanish scientific literature. I am carrying out virological and bacteriological tests to try and find an answer.'

The two Spanish puppies however are not the first reported examples of green pups.

In 2012, MailOnline reported on a green Labrador puppy born in Clayon-le-Moors, Lancashire.

Naomi Grimes and Kyle Murray's two-year-old golden Labrador, Buttons, gave birth to a litter of eight - but the couple were shocked when the second in the litter came out with an unusual green glow.

The other seven puppies were born - during the 28-hour labour - with normal golden coats. 

The cause for the colouring at that time was given as exposure to a substance called biliverdin, which can be found in the placenta.
