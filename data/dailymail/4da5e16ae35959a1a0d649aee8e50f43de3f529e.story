Paolo Di Canio has launched a withering tirade at Sunderland duo Phil Bardsley and Lee Cattermole - branding them 'rotten'.

The Italian, who was sacked by the club last September following a player revolt, also blasted 'two-faced' captain John O'Shea, while the club are refusing to comment on the claims.

In an explosive interview, Di Canio insisted he had the support of the majority of the squad before he was shown the door and replaced by Gus Poyet.Â

Earlier this month, defender Bardsley had described team spirit under Di Canio as 'beyond dead' while Cattermole said he was close to quitting the north east club.

But Di Canio did not hold back in his criticism of the pair.

'These two players were rotten - the most unprofessional players I have ever worked with,' he told the Sun on Sunday.

Di Canio, who wants to return to management in England, also believes O'Shea owes his team-mates an apology.

'I don't like people who, when they speak to you, don't look into your eyes,' he said. 'He should say sorry to some of his team-mates for the many times he came into my office to say something unfavourable about them.

'This is the same player who also came to me when I first took over and said things about (Martin) O'Neill.

'Of course, he now says something different because he has to play for him (O'Neill) again [for Ireland].'

It was O'Shea who confirmed the player
 revolt earlier this season but Di Canio insists he had the backing of 
most of the Black Cats squad.

He claims to have 14 text messages on his phone from players who supported him and believes the board should have given him more time.

The Italian also feels he was unable to the sign the players he wanted, despite 14 new arrivals at the club last summer.

Di Canio said he wanted to sign Jermain Defoe and Tom Huddlestone who were both keen to move north from Tottenham.

He laid the blame at the door of director of football Roberto De Fanti who was sacked last week.

Sunderland currently lie second bottom in the Premier League but reached the Capital One Cup final last week after a thrilling penalty shout-out win over Manchester United.

Poyet's side beat Kidderminster on Saturday to reach the fifth round of the FA Cup, and players were under strict instruction to avoid any mention of the Italian coach, who earlier had also attacked the club in a rambling interview on Football Focus.
