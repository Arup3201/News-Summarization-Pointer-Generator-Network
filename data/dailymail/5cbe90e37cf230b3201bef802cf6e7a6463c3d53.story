Ditch the winter woollies for now - respite from the chill is on the way.

Despite temperatures plummeting to lower than Lapland in some parts today, next week is set to be much warmer across the UK, with the mercury expected to reach a balmy 13C. 

Yet Britain woke up to the biggest freeze of the winter yesterday with temperatures  tumbling to almost -8C in parts of Scotland, amid warnings there could be four weeks of snow on the way.

And, after the brief let-up, the plummeting temperatures are expected to continue until Christmas, when experts predict the mercury could dip to a shivering -12C. 

One weather expert even warned that the New Year will start with an Arctic blast to rival the winter of 1963, with five feet of snow and night-time temperatures of -15C in some parts.

Forecasters predict that London could experience balmy temperatures of 13C next week - around 6C higher than the average for this time of year.

Temperatures will then level to the seasonal average of around 5C by the end of next week.

But the short-lived spike will be followed by an unsettled picture leading, with gales, snow, rain and freezing temperatures predicted in the run-up to Christmas.

Met Office forecaster Kirk Waite explained: 'It will be slightly warmer in the north and west but they can expect one or two wintry showers but these will then clear meaning there will be a clear night. 

'The weather is very changeable at the moment and that is the outlook as we head towards Christmas.'

Forecasters say that today there will be a dry, cold start for central, eastern and southern England, while rain will spread across the rest of the UK.

In the afternoon, the rain will move south-eastwards, with sunny spells and scattered wintry showers following into the north-west. There will be strong winds, especially in the north.

By the evening, the rain will clear from the south east to leave it dry with clear spells. But blustery, wintry showers will continue in western Scotland, with a slim chance of thunder in north parts. There will also be some frost in central areas of Scotland, with strong winds in the north half of the UK. 

Paul Mott, from weather forecaster MeteoGroup, said the snow in Scotland would melt overnight on Saturday before rain spreads across parts of the UK today, with snowy showers over the hills of Scotland overnight into Monday. 

Mr Mott said: 'On Wednesday temperatures will be up to 13C (55.4F) in the London area, and it will be mild in the South from the middle of the week.

'Around 7C (44.6F) is the average at this time of year in the London area. 13C (55.4F) is above average but not unusual for this time of year, but it will be a lot milder than we have seen recently.' 

But as the weeks go on, Exacta Weather forecaster James Madden says a 'colossal' area of surface water in the Atlantic that is much colder than average will affect the Gulf Stream and leave Britain exposed to winds from Siberia.

The coldest place last night was Eskdale Muir in Scotland where the mercury plummeted to -6.6C while one of the coldest spots in England was Benson in Oxfordshire where temperatures reached as low as -5.5C overnight.

Elsewhere the high winds and rain brought chaos to the roads and railway network as floods hit parts of Sussex and North Wales.

Flooding had left trains in Wales unable to run between Machynlleth and Newtown. On the A24 in Sussex drivers had to negotiate flood roads as water levels rose across the county after a night of heavy and prolonged rainfall.

At Dover, some ferry crossings were hit by delays as winds in the English Channel gusted up to force 10. 

The latest stormy weather comes after power was restored yesterday to thousands of homes left without electricity following a 'weather bomb' of gales and torrential rain which swept the country.  

Matt Martin, a forecaster at Meteogroup, said: 'It will be quite a cold snap with temperatures dropping away below zero under clear skies. 

'The outlook across the weekend is mixed with rain and snow over high ground in the north and that will drift south over Sunday.

'However there will be spells of wintry sunshine for much of the south and that will see temperatures falling below zero in the night.'

Forecasters say the long-term outlook is for mixed weather going towards Christmas with outbreaks of showery and snowy weather across the UK.
