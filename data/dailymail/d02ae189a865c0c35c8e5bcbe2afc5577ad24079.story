Conservative MP John Whittingdale has criticised the refusal of the Hacked Off campaign to negotiatie over press regulation

A senior Tory MP has criticised the refusal of the Hacked Off campaign to negotiate over the newspaper industry’s proposal for a tough new watchdog.

John Whittingdale, chairman of the culture, media and sport select committee, said the position taken by the group, which the Labour Party was ‘still very much tied to’, could result in no Royal Charter at all, which he said would be a ‘disaster’.

He said the refusal of the lobby group to entertain a compromise on the issue may also mean that a ‘recognition body’ for the Press is set up but ‘nobody comes along and asks for recognition’.

British newspapers came up with their own Royal Charter proposal for an independent regulator after rejecting a plan drawn up by politicians and the Hacked Off lobby group.

Mr Whittingdale said of the Press’s proposed charter that he would ‘nearly sign it tomorrow’ but that a way forward was proving difficult because of Labour and Hacked off.

Speaking at a Broadcasting Press Guild event, he said: ‘We are either very close to a happy outcome or a total shambles.

‘The Labour Party are still very much tied to Hacked off. If the Labour Party refuse to even talk about any amendment to the Government’s version then it looks as if it’s going to be impossible to reach an agreement.’

The Conservative MP added: ‘Hacked Off have very clearly rejected the industry’s version [of  a watchdog] and said Parliament has spoken and you have got to stick to Parliament.

‘But if the consequence of that is at best we do get a recognition body but nobody comes along and asks for recognition, or at worst we don’t get a Royal Charter at all – that is a disaster.’

He said Hacked Off had run a ‘clever campaign’ but ‘it is not helping the debate now if it is Hacked Off that is basically preventing discussion from reopening’.

A spokesman for Hacked Off said: ‘The Royal Charter approved by Parliament has the support of all parties, victims of Press abuse and the vast majority of the public.

‘Sadly some in the Press have learned nothing from recent years and are still resisting change, and the draft charter now proposed by some newspaper groups reflects this.’

But as Lord Wakeham, a former president of the Privy Council, wrote earlier this week: ‘The charter put forward on March 18 was never voted on in Parliament, which merely  had before it a motion that day to “consider… the Prime Minister’s intention to submit the charter to the Privy Council”.’
