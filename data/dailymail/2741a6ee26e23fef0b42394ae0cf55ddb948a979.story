A vicar has ordered Girl Guides to quit the church headquarters they have used for 86 years – because they have failed to attend enough religious services.

Angry leaders called the Reverend Stephen Terry ‘completely out of touch’ over his decision to exclude 28 Guides from a hall close to St Leonard’s Church in Hove, East Sussex.

They claim he has given the 7th Hove Guides their marching orders over their failure to attend Remembrance Sunday, Palm Sunday, Harvest Festival and Christmas services.

Out of touch: Reverend Stephen Terry at St Leonard's Church in Hove has banned Girl Guides after they failed to attend some services

Guide leader Julie Winder, 42, said the youngsters will hold their last meeting at the hall today.Mrs Winder said: ‘We feel we have been treated unfairly. This is very sad after such a long and happy association with the church.

‘We have been told we simply were not attending enough services for us to continue using their hall. But I can’t press-gang the entire troop into going to church.

‘We have never been a scrap of trouble to the church – in fact our girls have happily helped prepare food for both the summer fair and Christmas fair for more than 30 years.

‘I think the vicar is completely out of touch. Half the girls are of a different faith and we also have a Muslim youngster, so a high proportion of the group are not even Anglican.’

The group has used the hall as their base since 1927. More than 1,000 girls between the ages of ten and 14 have served with the 7th Hove at the venue since then.

Off colour: The Girl Guides have been forced to find a new home

Mr Terry, the vicar of St Leonard’s since 1998, said he had asked the group to turn up for the four important church services a year.

He added: ‘We also asked them to help out at a few church events. It is not the case that we have thrown them out. They have walked away from this standing agreement. It’s sad that it has come to end like this. I really have no further comment to make.’

The decision also affects about 20 Brownies aged between seven and ten attached to the troop, which had been using the hall rent-free.

The group has now been offered a room at nearby Portslade Town Hall – and will begin a new era there next month.
