Imagine having an under-bite so severe you could barely chew.

For one 21-year-old woman, that was a fact of life - until she underwent a major jaw realignment surgery four years ago in Toronto that not only corrected her bite, but also completely transformed her appearance.

'Before the surgery. I was afraid to smile and couldn't even look at my own reflection in the mirror without getting distraught,' said Brittany, who goes by the moniker LackofaBetterNameX on Reddit. 'I was depressed and battled with substance-abuse problems because of it.'

Before! Brittany, who goes by the name LackofaBetterNameX on Reddit, had an under bite so severe she could barely chew. In these photos, her jaw is actually closed; in the photo on the left, the lower protrusion is caused by her teeth

And after! After her surgery, Brittany's look was completely transformed, but she said it took about a year for her jaw to stop feeling 'fragile'

Brittany, who was 17 when she got her surgery, had to have her lower jaw moved back, her upper jaw moved forward, and her chin realigned. She had to have a total of 12 screws permanently placed in her mouth during the procedure.

She posted her before and after photos on Reddit - and the change was so noticeably drastic that the post quickly moved to the top of the site and garnered more than 1,000 comments.

The response to her story and photos was almost entirely positive, with many users asking for advice about getting the surgery themselves and others leaving accounts of their own experiences.

Brittany had to have the surgery for medical reasons, but said she found 'the mental health benefits to be much more immense.'

Before the procedure, she suffered bullying at the hands of her classmates  - and said that the physical appearance of her jaw was one of the main reasons she underwent the surgery when she did.

'My classmates were relentlessly cruel,' she said. 'I feel so much happier and stronger now because of everything that has happened though.'

Brittany would've liked to get the surgery done earlier, but couldn't because her bones were still growing. Her surgeon even thought 17 was too soon, but over-corrected her bit by a few millimeters to account for future growth.

Wow! Brittany posted another before and after, this time showing her profile - and the change is drastic

Ouch! Brittany, who's pictured here immediately following her surgery, said she wouldn't recommend the procedure to others unless it was 'absolutely necessary' because of the expense and long recovery time

Making progress! Five days after the surgery, Brittany started getting feeling back in her mouth and jaw area

When Reddit users asked if they should get the surgery done, Brittany said she wouldn't recommend it unless it was 'absolutely necessary' because of the expense and long recovery time.

'I spent two or three nights in the hospital after the procedure,' she wrote. 'I could have stayed for less, but I had an abnormal amount of bleeding, so they had to keep tubes in my mouth and my nose. Also, I was so sore and drugged up that I couldn't bring myself to drink, so they kept me for monitoring until I was more conscious and willing.'

She said it would take or two or three weeks unless she could even open her jaw the slightest bit - and she had to wear rubber-bands in her mouth to ensure she didn't over-extend her jaw. It wasn't for nearly two months that she could fully open her mouth. 

Heavy metal! Brittany had to wear large rubber bands in her mouth to ensure she didn't over-extend her jaw and also to help re-build the muscle

Already showing progress! Even 12 days after the surgery, the change is noticeable 

Still smiling! Four years after the surgery, Brittany says she is 'happy, healthy and about to start [her] Master's degree'

It took about a year, Brittany says, before her face didn't feel fragile.

Now, four years later, her jaw feels 100per cent back to normal - and she has all but forgotten about the pins in her mouth. The only time she thinks about them when she's getting X-rays, though she isn't sure they wouldn't set off metal detectors.

'Today, I am happy, healthy and about to start my Master's degree,' she says.
