Andy Murray emerged as one of the main beneficiaries of an extraordinary day in China that saw five of the top 10 lose and Rafael Nadal discuss having an operation next month.

The British No1’s chances of making the field for the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals were bolstered by some of his rivals falling at the Shanghai Masters, plus those assured of qualification, such as Nadal.

Murray lost only four points on his serve in the opening set as he registered a decent 7-5, 6-2 win over towering Pole Jerzy Janowicz to make the third round. In doing so he pushed himself very close to the frame for the eight-man field who will contest the season-ending championships at the O2 Arena. He is due to meet Spain’s David Ferrer on Thursday morning and victory would put him within a sliver — a mere five ranking points — of the eighth qualifying place currently occupied by Canada’s Milos Raonic.

Rafael Nadal lost to Feliciano Lopez and has a nagging problem with his appendix that may require surgery

Heather Watson is out of the Japan Open after suffering a second-round exit against Kazakhstan’s Yulia Putintseva. The sixth seed lost 6-4, 7-5.

The British No 1 was looking to regain the title she won in 2012 but teenager Putintseva, the world No 122, proved too strong.

Watson had lost in the first round of her previous four tournaments before beating Serb Jovana Jaksic earlier this week.

It is still conceivable that the year’s ninth-ranked player could make it to London as there has to be a doubt over Nadal, who has a nagging problem with his appendix that he believes will require surgery.

The Spaniard lost 6-3, 7-6 to compatriot Feliciano Lopez and then declared that he hoped to complete the season before having any operation, even though it could compromise his preparation for January’s Australian Open.

‘My thought is to continue and play Basle, Paris and London,’ said Nadal. ‘It’s true that I haven’t had the best of luck since Wimbledon.

'I was having a very good year and after that I was unlucky with my wrist and what is going on now.'

Nadal also found himself replaced as world No 2 by Roger Federer after the great Swiss saved five match points to avoid the pile-up of the seeds. He looked down and out against Argentina’s Leonardo Mayer before coming through 7-5, 3-6, 7-6 — winning the decisive tiebreaker 9-7.

It is not unusual to have strange results at this time of the season, which comes after the US Open but before the climax at the last Masters event in Paris followed by the O2.

Some players are carrying injuries, some very motivated, others demotivated and others just plain tired out by this stage of a long year. But losing five of the top 10 in one day is excessive even by October’s standards.

Aside from Nadal there were defeats for Stan Wawrinka, Kei Nishikori and Grigor Dimitrov, while Raonic retired injured. The latter two, ranked eight and 10, are particularly relevant to Murray in the scramble for places in London, making Thursday's match against Ferrer, currently ranked one place below him at 10, especially important.
