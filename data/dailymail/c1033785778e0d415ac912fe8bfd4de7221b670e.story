The Cabinet Secretary has been asked to investigate a string of unanswered questions over Downing Street’s handling of the child porn arrest and resignation of one of David Cameron’s closest aides.

Labour’s Shadow Cabinet Minister, Jon Ashworth, asked Sir Jeremy Heywood whether aide Patrick Rock was given advance notice that police were being called in.

He also demanded to know if it was right for a previous complaint against Mr Rock to be handled by the Prime Minister’s chief of  staff Ed Llewellyn – a friend of both Mr  Cameron and Mr Rock.

Downing Street has been accused of a cover-up after Mr Rock, deputy director of the  No 10 policy unit, was arrested over suspected child pornography offences on February 13. No 10 failed to disclose that he had resigned until confronted by the Daily Mail earlier this week.

Mr Cameron’s aides insist it would be been wrong to have made the affair public before the police, though the National Crime Agency, which was called in to Downing Street, is still refusing to comment.

Labour MPs suggest No 10 has failed to satisfy ‘a number of important questions’, including the sequence of events that saw Mr Rock resign before being arrested early the next day.

In a letter to Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy, Mr Ashworth asked when Downing Street was first made aware of the allegations, at what point Mr Rock was spoken to, when police were alerted and precisely when Mr Rock resigned.

It also emerged that Mr Rock, 62, who has been close to Mr Cameron for decades since they worked together as young advisers at the Home Office, had previously been accused of sexual harassment by a woman civil servant.

The complaint was made to Ed 
Llewellyn, Mr Cameron’s chief of staff, and it is understood that the 
Prime Minister was also informed.

Downing Street sources say the complaint was in no way related to the allegations involving child abuse images and had been ‘appropriately settled’.

The move of the complainant to another Government department was also unconnected to the incident, they insist.

Mr Ashworth asked Sir Jeremy exactly how much Mr Cameron had known of the previous complaint, and whether it was right for it to be handled by Mr Llewellyn, given his friendship with Mr Rock.

The two men both worked for Lord Patten, now head of the BBC, when he was a Brussels commissioner.

Mr Ashworth said: ‘I understand that Downing Street has a duty of care to Mr Rock. However, there seems to be a number of very basic and serious questions which need answering because he was a very senior figure in Cameron’s office.’

Questions: There are several aspects of the case which have been left unanswered by Number 10

Downing Street said Sir Jeremy would respond in due course but that it was satisfied the previous grievance and the arrest and resignation had been properly handled.

However it added that it could not answer some of the questions because of the potential for prejudicing an ongoing investigation.

Mr Rock was brought in to Downing Street as deputy head of policy in 2011, and was involved in drawing up Government policy on tackling online child abuse images.

Mr Cameron said he was ‘profoundly shocked’ by the allegations.

Mr Rock, who is unmarried and lives in west London, has not been charged with any offence and has not commented on his arrest.
