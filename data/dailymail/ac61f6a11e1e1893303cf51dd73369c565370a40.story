A Colorado County Sheriff has said he will not enforce new state gun measures that are expected to be signed into law.

Weld county Sheriff John Cooke says the proposed firearms restrictions give a 'false sense of security.'

On Friday, lawmakers in Colorado approved sweeping changed when it came to background checks on firearm purchases.

A 15-round limit on ammunition magazines has also been approved.

The bills now head to the desk of Democratic Governor John Hickenlooper who has said he will sign into law.

The state has suffered two of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history, but
 after months of debate both chambers of the majority Democratic 
Colorado legislature approved a package of four gun-control measures on 
Friday.

The passage of the bills could push 
Colorado to the forefront of a national gun control debate reignited by 
several mass shootings last year, including the December massacre of 20 
children and six adults at a school in Newtown, Connecticut.

President Barack Obama has put forward a number of gun control measures in the wake of the Newtown school shooting.

Deadly history: People visit a memorial for the victims of the Colorado movie theatre shooting

Cooke told GreeleyTribune.com that
 Democrats in the state legislature are uninformed and scrambling in 
response to the Aurora movie theater shooting and other recent 
tragedies.

'They’re feel-good, knee-jerk reactions that are unenforceable,' he said.

The bill that passed on Friday requires a $10 criminal background check to take place before legally transferring a gun.

Cooke says the proposed firearms transfer requirement would not keep guns out of the hands of criminals.

The sheriff says that he and other 
sheriffs 'won’t bother enforcing' the laws because it won't be possible 
to keep track of how gun owners are complying with the new requirements.

Republicans have opposed the bill, calling it an undue burden on law-abiding gun owners.

Cooke is joined in his opposition by a number of other Sheriff's including the El Paso County Sheriff Terry Maketa.

Maketa said his office keeps records 
of every concealed carry permit holder in the county as required by law,
 but he would never share it.

He said he would destroy the database
 if anyone tried to get their hands on it and would intervene if 
government agents started arresting county residents for exercising 
their constitutional rights.

Proposals: Colorado State Representative Rhonda Fields who has proposed the legislation says the bills are about 'saving lives'

Colorado is the first state outside 
the East Coast to significantly ratchet back gun rights after the 
theater and school shootings.

The state's gun debate was being 
watched closely because it's considered a swing state with both a 
gun-loving frontier past and an unfortunate history of mass shootings, 
including the 1999 Columbine High School attack.

Expanded checks have been a top 
priority for Hickenlooper, who called for the proposal during his State 
of the State address in January.

The sponsor of the Colorado magazine-limit bills, state House Representative Rhonda Fields, told fellow lawmakers in a floor debate last week he proposal was about 'saving lives.'

Next step: The laws will now head to Governor John Hickenlooper who has indicated he will support most of the measures

'These are weapons that should be used 
in a theater of war and not in our local theaters,' said Fields, a 
Democrat whose district includes the suburban Denver movie theater where
 a gunman killed 12 people in a shooting rampage last July.

Colorado was also the site of the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School, where two teenagers shot dead a teacher and 12 other students before committing suicide.

Other bills included in the package of gun-control laws approved by Colorado lawmakers included a measure to make firearm buyers pay for their own background checks and a ban on online certification for concealed-carry permits, both of which Hickenlooper has said he supports.

The proposals that won final approval had received little Republican support.

Republican House minority leader Mark Waller issued a statement after the bills' passage, calling Democrats 'out of touch' with their constituents.

'More than 200,000 Coloradans are out of work but Democrats are more concerned with passing legislation that will send hundreds of jobs out of our state without any increase in public safety to show for it,' Waller said in a statement.

Waller was referring to Magpul, a Colorado-based manufacturer of ammunition magazines that has vowed to leave the state and take away its hundreds of jobs if the magazine-limits bill becomes law.

The Colorado legislature's action follows the passage in New York state in January of a sweeping gun-control law that bans assault weapons and magazines that hold more than seven rounds of ammunition, requires gun owners to register most guns with the states and requires universal background checks.

Last week, a divided U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee advanced to the full Senate a measure endorsed by Obama that would require criminal background checks for all gun buyers.
