Attacked: Judge John Devaux had just jailed a motorist when he was apparently attacked by former fitness instructor Paul Graham in the courtroom

A judge was attacked and had his wig and robes pulled off after he jailed a motorist yesterday for causing death by dangerous driving.

The driver’s brother allegedly ran up to the judge’s chair and ‘started battering the hell’ out of him while shouting that the 30-month sentence was too harsh.

The man was restrained and the judge, 65-year-old John Devaux, continued to hear cases minutes after the attack.

Apparently unflustered, he told the court: ‘I think we’re all unharmed.’

Paul Graham, 27, was arrested on suspicion of assault and contempt of court and held in the court cells.

Witnesses said he was furious that his brother Philip had been jailed for 30 months for overtaking a car near the brow of a hill and killing a motorcyclist in a head-on crash.

Jaimie Budd, who was in the public gallery at Ipswich Crown Court, said the man stripped to his vest before wrestling with the judge and hitting him at around 10.45am.

She said: ‘We thought that he was going to reveal some sort of statement or tribute but instead he got up and ran to the judge’s bench.

‘He ran up the steps and started battering the hell out of the judge. He pulled his robes, his wig came off. It was extremely horrific.’ She said that the man shouted ‘arrest me’ and claimed that his brother was a victim of ‘injustice’.

Two police officers in the court for the sentencing restrained the man after he left the public gallery and attacked the judge.

John Weston, who was also at court, said: ‘I saw a couple of chairs had been turned over. I was grabbed on the back and told to “wait” by two security guards who rushed past me.’

Appearing before the judge in the afternoon, Paul Graham was told he would be kept in custody and be dealt with by another judge today.

Judge Devaux told him: ‘It is not right that I should deal with this case.’

Graham, who was still dressed in his black vest, had blood on his left elbow and kept his eyes closed throughout the hearing.

The drama unfolded shortly after 
Judge Devaux sentenced employment consultant Philip Graham, 30, of 
Haverhill, Suffolk, for causing a fatal head-on crash on July 4 last 
year.

He was driving to catch a train at 
Audley End, Essex, when he pulled out to overtake a car near the brow of
 a hill and hit motorcyclist  Derek Foster, 37, who was on his way to 
work. The father of two,  a former soldier, died from multiple injuries.

Philip Graham denied causing death by dangerous driving, but was found guilty at an earlier trial.

Yesterday a former colleague of Paul 
Graham, who previously worked as a fitness instructor, said: ‘He was 
always quite a fiery character. He was very opinionated and always 
thought that his point of view was right.’

The attack on Judge Devaux, who has 
been a circuit judge since 1993, comes 12 years after a woman judge at 
the Old Bailey was assaulted by a man accused of murder.

Judge Ann Goddard needed five stitches after being punched repeatedly in the head by the man who had leapt from the dock.

Last December, family court judges 
spoke out to say they fear attacks by angry parents because of 
inadequate security. They reported that a number have been attacked by 
mothers and fathers, including one female judge who was seriously 
injured.

One judge said: ‘I have been 
threatened. A very angry father stood up and shouted anti-Semitic 
threats at me. Another father threw a cup of water across the courtroom.
 Another parent threw a book but fortunately I was too far away for it 
to reach me.'
