Even the most ardent chocoholic would be repelled by this Crème Egg which was infested a colony of ants.

Horrified grandmother Heather Manzie was just about to take a bite of the Cadbury sweet when she noticed one of the insects emerge from the wrapping.

The 52-year-old split the treat open and discovered to her disgust a heaving ball of the insects

Sickened: Heather Manzie, 52, was disgusted when she found an ant colony in her Creme Egg

She said: ‘It was absolutely awful - I will never eat another Creme Egg again. The thought is making my skin crawl.

‘I was having a wee break from work and I ate one of the eggs, which was fine, and put the other one down on the table.

‘My granddaughter Danielle, who is 12, was there and I asked her if she wanted one but thankfully she said no.

‘Half an hour later, I picked up the second egg and noticed ants on the table. It was then I saw an ant coming out of the seam of the egg’s foil paper.

‘I was screaming. I got the egg, ran outside, split it open, and was horrified to find there was a colony of ants inside - about 50 or 60 of them.

‘It was sickening - to think either my granddaughter or I could have put it in our mouth is disgusting.’

Mrs Manzie videoed the egg before treating it with fly spray and returning it to the shop, where she claims the only compensation she was offered was a £1 refund on the chocolate.

Horror: Mrs Manzie has vowed never to eat her favourite treat ever again after she found a colony of ants in her Creme Egg

She said: ‘I felt like I was being dismissed. I couldn’t eat my tea that night - it was horrible. Now, I have been steam cleaning my house because I’m terrified it’s infested.’

Mrs Manzie, who runs a dog kennels, had decided to treat herself to chocolate and bought the confectionery at a shop near her home in Cupar, Fife.

Having eaten one of the two eggs, she was baffled when she left the other on the table and came back to find it crawling with the insects.

A spokesman for the Factory Shop, where Mrs Manzie bought the chocolate, said the store’s supply of Creme Eggs had been removed immediately after she had alerted them to the problem.

He said: ‘Staff were shocked when they discovered what she was telling them. The eggs were taken off sale immediately and destroyed.

Sweet: How a Cadbury Creme Egg should look

‘They couldn’t find any other eggs with the problem - it may have been an isolated incident where the problem arose at any point of sale - but we do take these matters seriously.

‘The customer left before staff had the chance to explain to her that the eggs were being removed.

‘If she contacts us, we would like to offer our apologies directly.’

A spokesman for Kraft Foods, which manufactures the eggs, added: ‘This sounds like an extremely unpleasant experience for Mrs Manzie.

‘Given these would have left our factory some months ago, this infestation has not happened within our control.

‘However, we ask Mrs Manzie to send the products back to us so we can investigate further.’
