Charlie Adam will not be charged by the FA for the tackle on Paulinho which has ruled the Brazilian out for a month with damaged ankle ligaments.

Referee Kevin Friend did not see the incident at the time and it has been reviewed by the FA's disciplinary panel, who examined the video evidence and decided it was not worthy of a red card.

There will be no further action, although this may not deter Tottenham from their plan to write to the FA about Adam's tackling, which has left its mark four times on Spurs players in less than three years.

Gareth Bale was twice hurt by Adam, Scott Parker and now Paulinho. Tottenham have confirmed today after MRI scans that the Brazil international is likely to be out for about four weeks.

Response: Adam tweeted to set the record straight after receiving abuse on the social network

Spurs fans booed Adam when he 
appeared as a second-half substitute on Sunday and Paulinho made his 
feelings clear as he hobbled off the pitch by shouting at Stoke manager 
Mark Hughes.

However, after receiving abuse on Twitter, Adam said: ‘Just for the record and the people tweeting me abuse saying so, I
don’t and never have had anything against Spurs and I would never 
intend to injury a fellow professional.’

Spurs are likely to take the unusual step of writing to the FA about Adam.

Angry: Former Spurs chairman Alan Sugar made his feelings known on Twitter

Tottenham's anger at yet another 
incident was clear in a statement on Paulinho's condition released on Tuesday morning, unusually highlighting the perpetrator's role in the incident.

'Following a MRI scan, the club can 
confirm that Paulinho has sustained significant ligament damage to his 
right ankle after a heavy challenge from Charlie Adam during Sunday's 
win against Stoke City,' read a statement on the club's official 
website.

'The Brazil international was forced off as a result of the injury and is expected to be sidelined for at least four weeks.'

Bale
was twice hurt by Adam and branded him a ‘coward’ after the second 
incident, during a pre-season friendly between Tottenham and Liverpool 
in the United States in 2012.

‘What
he did was over the top,’ said Bale at the time. ‘Some people are like 
that and it’s just wrong. There are pictures on the internet of what he 
did before when he snapped all my ankle ligaments. I was out for three 
months that time and one player told me he went out to do it again.’

Bale
escaped serious injury when the pair clashed in the States last year 
and then boss Andre Villas-Boas revealed Spurs were thinking of 
contacting the authorities about Adam. ‘Will we take it further? We are 
discussing it,’ he said.

Spurs
manager Tim Sherwood has Jan Vertonghen, Sandro, Younes Kaboul, Danny 
Rose and Jermain Defoe injured for tomorrow’s trip to Manchester United.
He wants a left back in January and United defender Alexander Buttner 
and Real Madrid’s Fabio Coentrao are possibilities.
