They put a smile on the faces of generations of children.

But these must-have Christmas toys have left many parents in a cold sweat over the past 50 years.

The items were often in such high demand that shoppers struggled to find them in time for December 25.

Debenhams has compiled a list of the top ten Christmas toys of the past five decades, based on the store’s takings for them each year.

Top of Santa’s deliveries were Cabbage Patch Kids dolls, the soft toys with pudgy faces, which today sell for up to £30.

Created by American art student Xavier Roberts in 1978, they dominated toy charts through the 1980s and remain popular.

The fiendishly difficult Rubik’s Cube took second place. The puzzle, invented in 1974 by Hungarian professor of architecture Erno Rubik, became a craze in British school playgrounds.

The biggest selling toy in 1987, Sylvanian Families, made a slight comeback in the digital age. It claimed tenth place on the Debenham's list

The infuriatingly tricky Rubiks Cube invented in 1974 is still a popular choice according to the research

Third place went to Monopoly, the board game which can trace its roots back to 1903 when it was invented by an American woman, Lizzie Philips.

Her goal was to create an educational tool to explain tax theory and it was not until 1933 that it was launched by Parker Brothers as a family game.

It has been updated over the generations and even this year a new version, featuring big brand names like Coca-Cola and McDonald’s, is tipped to be a success.

Behind Monopoly come Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle figures, also still popular, followed by a Buzz Lightyear robot figure from the Toy Story films.

In 1996, the year the first film was released in the UK, the demand for Buzz Lightyear toys had parents touring high streets desperate to find one.

It was a pattern followed in later years for the Teletubby soft toys from the popular pre-school BBC series and the owl-like Furby.

Dolls inspired by the popular nineties television programme, Teletubbies, were also featured on the list put together by Debenhams

Family favourite Monopoly was third on the list. The game was first made in 1936, and has been adapted and modified ever since

Other famous names in the top ten were Barbie dolls, which have been on sale since 1959, and Sylvanian families.

Lego is placed at number ten in the Christmas list.

But the brand also maintains strong sales throughout the year.

James Ford, toy buyer for Debenhams, said: ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Lego are still as popular today as they were when they first launched.

'These brands have stood the test of time.’

But he said there has been a shift towards hi-tech gifts, such as the £90 Kurio 4S touch tablet.
