If news that Kate Moss working on a new collection for Topshop wasn’t enough, the High Street mecca has another celebrity collaboration to celebrate.

After the stellar success of her first collection with the brand, the perennially cool Kate Bosworth is back for round two.

The actress has unveiled a chic line of pared-back designs made with high-end fabrics and some serious style credentials.

Round two: Kate Bosworth, known and loved for her perennially cool style, is back with a second collection for Topshop

Dubbed simply 'The Collection', the range aims to be the ultimate capsule wardrobe for winter.

With a mix of masculine and feminine shapes, including oversized designs, the range represents Kate's own personal style.

The 30-year-old explained that her 
autumn range, which she developed alongside the design team, is different from her spring line but still stays 
true to her boho style.

Androgyny vs femininity: The Collection prides itself as being the ultimate capsule wardrobe for winter, with a perfect mix of masculine and feminine, as well as oversized and fitted designs

The collection includes oversized collarless coats in shearling, leather shirts, biker pants, cashmere T-shirts, and eye-catching metallic crackle-effect skirts.

The starlet has combined luxurious 
minimalism with neat, clean lines and the colour palette is simple 
(think Mondrian-inspired monochrome, cracked silver metallic and few 
pops of red).

As for accessories, bags - such as a roll-top clutch in shearling and a zip-wallet in silver - are oversized and eye-catching, too.

Shoes
 are pointed and high, making them perfect for a night on the town, and belts are distressed and wet-look.

Kate Phelan, creative director of Topshop, added: 'The collection is everything you need to get easy cool effortless style.
