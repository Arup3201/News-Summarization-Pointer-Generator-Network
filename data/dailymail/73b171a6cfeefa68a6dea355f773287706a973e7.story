He's usually a very savvy businessman, so Bernie Ecclestone might be surprised to learn that a classic Mercedes he sold six years ago for £300,000 has gone on sale today... for £1million.

The F1 supremo parted company with his stunning 1955 Mercedes 300SL Gullwing in 2007 alongside a number of other cars from his famous collection.

But the iconic sports car’s value has skyrocketed in recent years - leaving egg on the face of the 82-year-old billionaire.

Bernie Ecclestone's iconic Mercedes 300SL Gullwing is on the market for £1million, which is £700,000 more than he sold it for

The car's now worth HOW much? Bernie Ecclestone

Hertfordshire-based DK Engineering bought the Gullwing last year and have treated it to a graphite grey bare-metal repaint.

And apart from the paint job and some work to the interior, the car is pretty much as it was the day Mr Eccelstone accepted a £308,000 bid for it three years ago at RM Auctions’ London sale.

Since then, the car has shot up in value, with DK Engineering now putting it back on the market with a £1million asking price - a 233 per cent increase.

The 300 SL, nicknamed the Gullwing because of its famous doors, was built by Mercedes between 1955 and 1957.

With a 3-litre engine developing 210bhp, the 140mph Mercedes was the world’s fastest production car of its day, with 1,400 built by the German manufacturer.

The ex-Ecclestone car comes complete with its original ‘Rudge knock off wheels’ and has covered just 20,000 miles in its 58-year history.

James Cottingham, vehicle acquisition consultant at DK Engineering, described the Gullwing as a 'really good example', adding £1million is 'where the market is at'.

The 1950s' 300 SL Gullwing used brand new fuel-injection and weight-saving technology to achieve a mind-blowing top speed of 160mph, the fastest production car on Earth.

At the time, the Gullwing retailed for $11,000 in America, meaning only the rich and famous could have one.

It also ensured Mercedes was a premium brand from then on.

Among Hollywood's elite, Clark Gable and Sophia Loren both owned one.

He said: 'The car has matching chassis, engine and body numbers as well as the original Rudge Knock-off wheels.

'This is a great useable car with all
the right attributes: a good file, famous ownership, originality, low 
mileage from new and a stunning colour combination.

'The Gullwing model has firmly inserted itself at the blue-chip end of the classic market with recent sales proving the model's investment credentials and of course the prospect of a Mille Miglia [road rally] entry must not be overlooked.'

High-end estate agency Knight Frank - which tracks the value of nine collectible assets from antique furniture to wine and jewellery - recently revealed the car market was the top one to invest in, with values up 28 per cent over the past 12 months, 115 per cent over five years and 430 per cent over the past decade.
