Anthea Harding, 41, was suspended from the Subway store in Harrods she worked at after she was accused of stealing because she tried to take her lunch - part of her food allowance - home 

A Harrods worker was suspended after she was accused of stealing when she tried to take her half-eaten lunch home. 

Anthea Harding, a mother of one, has worked as a team leader at a Subway outlet in the food court in Harrods in Knightsbridge, London, for almost a year and a half.

When the 41-year-old only managed a few mouthfuls of her lunch - which she gets as part of a staff allowance - because she worked through her break in the busy Subway outlet in the staff restaurant, she wrapped up the rest to take home at the end of her shift.

But as Ms Harding, of Bloomsbury, tried to leave the store she was stopped by security guards who told her she was not allowed to take food off the premises, and it was considered stealing. 

She was suspended on February 3 and is still waiting to find out from her employer, Eurest, whether she will lose her £7.50 an hour job. 

'They took all my cards away, my Harrods card, my ID store card,' Ms Harding told the Evening Standard. 

Ms Harding, who has worked at the Subway outlet for 14 months, said she was not aware of the company policy that free lunches must be eaten on the premises and said she was desperate to get back to work. 

On the day of the incident she had chosen a chicken and mushroom pie, mashed potatoes and baked beans. 

But after taking a couple of bites she returned to work and wrapped up the box in her apron, which she took with her as she left to go home. 

She added: 'I got to the ground floor and there were plain-clothes security doing checks. They said I wasn't allowed to take food out - it's considered theft and I would be contacted by the manager.' 

Ms Harding said she received a letter from Harrods, which explained it had been alleged she concealed a box of food in her apron.

Ms Harding claims all her ID cards and Harrods cards have been taken away from her since she was accused 

The mother-of-one said she is desperate to get back to her job as a team leader at the Subway outlet 

It added: 'You did not declare this item and did not pay for it.'  

Eurest said a formal disciplinary process is currently taking place following the incident.

A Harrods spokesman told MailOnline: ‘While Ms Harding has worked within the Knightsbridge store, she is employed by our contractor, Eurest, which operates Harrods’ staff restaurant.

‘We referred this matter to Eurest for their investigation, and they are handling it in line with their procedures. 

'As part of our company policy, Harrods notified Ms Harding that her store approval has been removed pending this investigation.’
