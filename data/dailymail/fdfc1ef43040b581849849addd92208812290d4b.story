A street cleaner who was stabbed as he tackled a burglar has died of his injuries, police say.

Piotr Mikewicz, 40, hit the burglar across the head with his broom as the thief emerged from a house in Shepherd’s Bush carrying two laptops.

He was left fighting for his life after being stabbed in the chest and has now died in hospital.

A 30-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and is currently in custody at a central London police station.

Two other men and three women
have been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.

Councillor Greg Smith, Hammersmith 
and Fulham Council Deputy Leader, praised Mr Mikewicz’s bravery and 
described him as a ‘friendly, hard-working man’.

He said: ‘Everyone at the council is 
deeply saddened by the tragic news that Piotr Mikewicz, who was one of 
the borough’s dedicated street cleaners, has died after being stabbed by
some scum of the earth who obviously has no regard for human life.

‘Piotr was a hard-working man, who was a friendly face to all who knew him on his regular beat.

‘Piotr was a family man who 
courageously tried to intervene when he spotted a crime in progress and 
our thoughts are with his family and friends at this extremely difficult
time.

‘Although this is an isolated 
incident, it is deeply shocking that Piotr’s genuine act of bravery 
should end in such brutal violence and we trust that the perpetrators of
this evil will be brought to justice swiftly.’

Cordoned off: Forensic teams search the property the thief broke into

A spokesman for Scotland Yard said: 
‘A street cleaner who was stabbed after trying to stop a burglar from 
getting away in West London has died from his injuries.

‘The man, aged 40, died in St Mary’s Hospital Paddington earlier today.

‘Although police believe they know the man’s identity, we await formal identification. The deceased is from Eastern Europe.’

The have-a-go hero attacked the 
burglar just before 2pm on Wednesday as he emerged from a house on 
Rylett Road, a plush London street with houses worth more than £1m, with
two laptops.

Eyewitnesses said the cleaner was 
given emergency heart treatment as he lay in the road by two district 
nurses who happened to be passing.

Lee Rivett, a builder who was working at a house nearby, said he spoke to the cleaner a few minutes before the incident.

He said: ‘Just before he was passing the house I was working on and we had a quick chat.

‘I told him not to worry about cleaning the front of the house where I was working.

‘Two minutes later came out he was lying down on the road.

‘I heard that he caught someone 
trying to burgle someone.A fight has broken out and I know he swung a 
broom at the guy. I think he caught him on the top of the head.

‘Obviously who ever they’re looking for has claret running down his head and was holding two laptops.

‘There were two people trying to help him. I saw them trying to resuscitate him by massaging his chest.’

Police continue their search on the plush London street, with houses worth more than £1m, where the burglary took place

The suspect - described as a white male - fled the scene along Askew Road towards Goldhawk Road.

Police sealed off streets in the area as they search drains and gardens for the weapon.

A London Ambulance spokesman added: ‘We were at the scene in less than five minutes.

‘One ambulance crew, a single responder in a car, a duty officer and an air ambulance were at the scene.’

A woman who lived next door to the 
house which was raided said: ‘I saw the injured man lying on the ground 
with an oxygen mask and clearly saw a wound on the left-hand side of his
body. There was a paramedic dabbing at it.’

The woman, who asked not to be named,
said the medics worked on the injured man for about an hour before he 
was airlifted to hospital.

She said: ‘The reason why it had taken them so long is because he had been given open heart surgery in the road.’
