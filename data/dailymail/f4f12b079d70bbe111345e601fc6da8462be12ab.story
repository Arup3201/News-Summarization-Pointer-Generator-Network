A is for Alice Cooper, B is for Black Sabbath and C is for Cream; well that's the alphabet imagined by this feisty two-year-old girl.

Chris Baker from Virginia filmed his daughter passionately thrashing out her ABCs to a heavy metal soundtrack.

As the drums and electric guitar aggressively kick in, the youngster pulls a fearsome facial expression to match. 

At the end of her rousing rendition, she wails 'now I know my ABCs!' before cheekily poking her tongue out.

Her father can be seen chuckling in the background as he captures the comical moment on his phone.

Baker said he had just got his daughter out of the bath tub when she decided to get 'angry with her alphabet.'

In the video, when the music cuts, the infant appears to lose her train of thought and stops in her tracks.

Then when the beat strikes up again, she suddenly speeds off again with her words.

At the end of the clip, she decides she's had enough headbanging for one night and asks for 'mommy' instead.

To date Baker's video titled Metal Alphabet has been watched more than 750,000 times.

Many viewers have applauded his daughter's performance, deeming it 'cute' and 'superb'.

'You go baby girl!' one commenter encouraged.

Baker says bath time is a special bonding time for him and his daughter and she often likes to sing while having a wash.
