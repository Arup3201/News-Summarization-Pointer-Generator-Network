Of all the players Jose Mourinho wanted to avoid losing at this critical point in the season, Nemanja Matic was perhaps top of his list.

Eden Hazard, Cesc Fabregas, Diego Costa or John Terry would all be missed, of course, but Matic dictates how Chelsea plays.

His prowling presence, tackling strength and defensive acumen in midfield offers more freedom to the creative players, especially Fabregas in his deeper role.

Matic's reaction to Barnes's tackle earned the Serbian a red card - he'll now miss the Capital One Cup final

Of 37 games featuring Matic this season Chelsea have lost only one - at Tottenham. Of the three he missed they have lost two - against Newcastle and Bradford.

The flashpoint between him and Burnley's Ashley Barnes – the bad tackle missed by officials, the reaction and the red card for violent conduct - may yet prove to be a moment of title race significance to match the meltdown at Aston Villa last March.

'The man is a giant, not for his size but the way he plays,' said Mourinho of Matic, after winning at Liverpool in November.

Chelsea were undecided about whether to appeal the red card on Sunday night. They have the right to, in which case it will go before an independent commission to decide if Martin Atkinson made the right call.

It is hard to imagine the commission overturning it as Matic's reaction fell firmly into the category of violent conduct regardless of the provocation and precisely where he put his hands - but they have been known to make some strange decisions and Mourinho might consider it worth a try.

Without him, Chelsea have to adjust the balance. Making it worse, John Obi Mikel is out with a knee injury and not close to a return.

'No chance,' said Mourinho was asked if Matic's most obvious replacement might be rushed back for the Capital One Cup final against Spurs at Wembley, on Sunday.

Asked who might play, he replied: 'Somebody will.'

With Mikel sitting as he does in front of the centre-halves, Chelsea could flank him with Ramires and Cesc Fabregas and switch to a 4-3-3 shape.

Without him, Mourinho's options revolve around Nathan Ake, a 20-year-old defensive midfielder who has started only twice this season, and Ramires, who is clearly at his best when galloping freely rather than sitting and reading the game.

Neither can boast the height of Matic or Mikel. Ramires was easily beaten in the air at a corner by Ben Mee for Burnley's late equaliser at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.

The corner came when Thibaut Courtois pushed a shot wide from Barnes, who was allowed to twist and aim at goal from that edge-of-the-box area usually patrolled by Matic.

It is in these pockets of space between the holding midfielders and the centre-halves that Tottenham's best players Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen seek to do their damage.

On Mourinho's side, is the fact he has time to plan.

Chelsea have the entire week free while Spurs are flying to Italy to play Fiorentina on Thursday in the second leg of the Europa League last-32 tie which is poised at 1-1.

Mourinho likes to plot as he did when he won with a weakened team at Liverpool in April, although both Matic and Mikel played that day and he had given up on winning the Barclays Premier League.

This season, he is determined to win it and these next three games are vital.

First, the Capital One Cup final, with Mourinho searching for the first trophy since his return, but lose at Wembley and the worm of doubt will eat away on a day when Manchester City will cut the gap at the top to two points if they win at Liverpool.

After that, Chelsea travel across the capital for a London derby with West Ham and a home fixture against gravity-defying Southampton, two games which promise intense and physical midfield contests.

Filipe Luis was honest in his assessment of the game, claiming that Chelsea should have won the match

'Nemanja will be missed,' admitted goalkeeper Courtois. 'He has been very good for us this season. It is a pity but heads-up we must continue. We have other players who can do the job also and they are strong players.'

Courtois thought the sending off changed the game on Saturday but, unlike their manager, the Chelsea players did not try to avoid blame for dropping points at home for only the second time this season.

'We should have won the game,' said full-back Filipe Luis. 'I don't believe in luck and don't want to talk about the referee. We cannot allow these things to happen. We cannot lose points at home.

'We played really well. We had a lot of chances. We were solid in defence and everyone was running in attack. But it is not easy. We are top of the league and everyone is trying to steal points from us.

'We have to say Burnley did a good job. They have won points against Manchester City and Manchester United. They are a good team.'

Well said Filipe Luis, because this point was in danger of being lost amid Mourinho's storm of numbers and silent accusations about Barnes and referee Martin Atkinson.

Burnley did play well, even before the sending off. They have only won four this season but are eking out points and fighting for survival.

'It was a massive point after going down against one of the best teams in the world,' said defender Kieran Trippier.
