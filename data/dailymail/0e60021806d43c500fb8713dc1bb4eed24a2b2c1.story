U.S. soldiers are being flown to West Africa to combat Ebola following just four hours of hazmat training, it was today claimed.

The serviceman at Fort Campbell and Fort Bragg are given swift instructions on how to protect themselves against the deadly virus by Army medical teams before deployment.

These include how to put on, remove and decontaminate protective equipment, as well as a practical test that aims to ensure soldiers understand the procedures.

It comes as the Ebola death toll has struck 4,546, bringing the total number of confirmed and suspected cases of the virus to 9,191.

During the four-hour hazmat training, a team of two can train as many as 50 soldiers, the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) told The Daily Beast.

'All training is tiered to the level of risk each person may encounter,' said Caree Vander Linden, spokesman for USAMRIID, which is based out of Fort Detrick.

So far, there are 547 U.S. troops in West Africa, serving in Senegal and Liberia, where they have reportedly been holing up in improvised quarters in hotels and local government facilities.

This is while the military builds a 25-bed hospital, 'life support areas' and 17 treatment centers in Liberia, where they can train local professionals to care for and conduct tests on potential victims.

Safety measures: The soldiers are also not permitted to shake hands, must frequently wash their hands with a chlorine solution and are required to have their temperatures measured (pictured) several times a day

According to USA Today, the four-hour training process can be daunting for soldiers, with some being told that Ebola 'basically causes your body to eat itself from the inside out'.

Others have reportedly been warned that the disease is 'worse' that what they might have encountered in Afghanistan, while several have been told the virus is 'catastrophic... with a high fatality rate'.

'I’ll be honest with you,' one soldier told the newspaper. 'I’m kind of scared.'

Despite the trainers' apparent shock tactics, the Army maintains that the risk of soldiers contracting the virus is minimal because it is not airborne and they will not have contact with sick patients.

'It's been shown that this disease is most manifest when handling bodily fluid—blood, other sorts of fluids, said Major General Darryl Williams, who leads America’s operations center in Liberia.

'There is no plan right now for U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines to do that'.

The servicemen are also not permitted to shake hands, must frequently wash their hands with a chlorine solution and are required to have their temperatures measured several times a day.

However, some are working with Liberian Army members on a daily basis, and their current living quarters - particularly those  in hotels - means they are surrounded by foreign nationals.

Military spokesmen said they were relying on CDC guidelines to protect soldiers against Ebola. But these guidelines have been called into question after victim Thomas Eric Duncan was misdiagnosed and his nurse was allowed to board a plane just a day before she was hospitalized with the virus. 

President Barack Obama has committed more than $1billion toward a global fund to battle Ebola in West Africa. 

Yesterday, it was reported that the U.S. Army is preparing to provide as many as 3,000 troops to help combat the Ebola epidemic.

These would include more soldiers from the Navy 'Seabees' (Construction Battalions), Navy medical personnel, soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division and other airmen, according to USA Today.

Since the Ebola outbreak, most cases of the virus have been recorded in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. Symptoms of the virus include a high fever, vomiting, a headache and joint aches.

These appear two to 21 days after exposure to the disease, the CDC said.
