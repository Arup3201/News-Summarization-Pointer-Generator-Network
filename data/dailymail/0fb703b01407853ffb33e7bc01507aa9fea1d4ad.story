Sam Chalmers, son of 1990 Grand Slam legend Craig, has been using his own lamentable story to warn teams at the IRB Junior World Championship in New Zealand about the dangers of taking drugs.

Chalmers, 20, tested positive for a banned substance in the run up to last year’s tournament in France and was subsequently banned for two years.

The Melrose player has expressed his regret at his mistake and told his tale to this year’s future stars of world rugby and encouraged them to be aware and educate themselves on anti-doping matters.

Chalmers has since gone on to become a personal trainer and will be eligible to play Rugby again from June 2015.

‘You don’t realise how much you miss something until you lose it,’ said the former Melrose player. ‘I now know that hard work beats everything, and there’s no shortcuts in Rugby.

'All the players that have gone pro have worked hard. I cheated and took the easy option, but you can’t do it as it will come back to bite you.

‘I was under pressure to get bigger and one day I decided to take what my friend had taken. I didn’t think what it could do to my body.

'It was a supplement that I ordered online and I only took it for a week, but that online order was the worst mistake of my life.’

IRB Anti-Doping Manager for Testing and Education, Ilaria Baudo, said: ‘The feedback from the sessions with Sam at this year’s tournament has been really positive.

'Many of the players and team management have described how touching his story has been, and how it’s made them aware of the dangers and the consequences in taking prohibited substances.

‘Sam is an incredibly brave young man and the IRB is grateful for the time he has given to share his story with players of his generation.

'It has taken a huge amount of courage to put his hand up and try to turn his negative experience into a positive one. The IRB wish him all the best in his quest to return to the playing field.’

The head of WADA, Sir Craig Reedie, told Sportsmail on Tuesday about the dangers of taking supplements — and UKAD has warned British sports stars that they have ‘no excuses’ not to be educated ahead of the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow this summer.
