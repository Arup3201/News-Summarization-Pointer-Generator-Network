Sarcastic humour, heavy drinking and miserable weather are among the most common complaints made by expats living Britain, a study has found.

More than half of foreigners find British people fit their international stereotype to some extent - with many saying a tendency to drink tea rang true.

While expats appreciate British manners and the ability to queue, almost half said the excessive drinking culture was their least favourite trait in people and 31 per cent regarded British sarcasm as unpopular.

Bad habits: Britons' excessive drinking habits is one of the main problems expats have with living in the UK

The study, conducted by a visa application help website, polled 1,402 expats living in Britain who had originated from various parts of the world, as part of research into opinions on the British way of life.

Downpours: Britain's damp weather was another popular moan among foreigners living here

The expats were asked if they liked living in Britain and 68 per cent said they did, but almost a third said they did not.

The most common reason for those who disliked living in Britain was the weather, with 38 per cent of expats agreeing on that.

Almost a third did not like British culture and more than a fifth said they did not like British cuisine.

Expats were asked for their opinions on the British populace, and the majority said that generally speaking they did like British people.

The remaining 23 per cent said 'No, not really'.

Liam Clifford, from GlobalVisas.com, 
the website that conducted the research, said: 'Moving to a new country 
poses many challenges.

'You
 might think you know all about a place from holidays and previous trips
 there, but actually living in a country puts an entirely different 
perspective on it.

'The majority of nationalities have stereotypes fitted around them and Brits don’t escape this.

'With
 our imperialist past, Brits have influenced many countries worldwide, 
which means our stereotypes are, if anything, more entrenched than those
 of other countries.

'People probably come here with a stereotype-based preconception of what to expect.

'It’s good to see from our survey though that, in the majority of cases, this reputation is actually enhanced upon living here.'
