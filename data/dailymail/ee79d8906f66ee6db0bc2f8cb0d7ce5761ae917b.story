This is the deadly six-inch gap on a 125mph railway line in Britain that was not repaired until two weeks after it was first discovered.

The broken rail was on the East Coast Mainline near Selby, North Yorkshire, and had 'crumbled away to nothing' causing a 'risk to life', experts have said.

Last Friday the damaged stretch at Hambleton South Junction was shut for five hours and nine trains were cancelled as engineers finally stepped in.

Just as worryingly there have been several other dangerous incidents on the same line in the past five months.

Experts say it could have led to another Hatfield disaster, where four died after a London to Leeds train was derailed by 'critical cracks' in 2000.

This picture has has sparked a major investigation, and is a 'mirror image' of another gap found on the line just before Christmas.

The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) - the national rail safety watchdog -  said today it was investigating a 'number of rail breaks' on the line, which runs from London to Scotland.

These include a broken rail spotted by the pubic in Lincolnshire last September and a 10cm gap seen by a train driver near York last November.

The latest incident, near Selby, was spotted by on track teams and the section of track eventually replaced.

But Bob Crow's RMT union said the fault 'raises serious questions about the impact of wear and tear on rail infrastructure.'

'This shocking new picture highlights the reality on Britain’s railways today - staffing, inspections and track renewals have been cut in the dash to save money and there is massive pressure right from the top of government to keep services running at all costs regardless of the potential human cost,' he said.

'We had trains thundering over this section of rail between London and the north at speeds of up to 125 mph.

'A train could easily have been derailed and even crashed into another coming the other way with loss of life.'

A Network Rail (NR) spokesman confirmed the 'dip', as they called it, was found on January 17, but the track was not replaced until last Saturday February 2.

'A dip in our track was identified and spotted at Hampleton on 17 January,' a spokesman said.

'Following our well-tried and tested industry procedure to remedy such dips, we scheduled an intervention to repair this dip on the Saturday night of 2 February.

'Unfortunately, the track deteriorated more quickly than is to be expected and, on discovering the broken rail, all traffic was stopped immediately while a repair was carried out.'
