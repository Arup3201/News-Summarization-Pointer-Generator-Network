Cleared: Andrew Machin, 40, has become one of the first men in the UK top be acquitted of rape because he suffers from sexsomnia

A ‘sexsomniac’ wept as he was cleared of raping a drunk 21-year-old after telling jurors he had been asleep when he assaulted her.

Andrew Machin, 40, admitted having sex with the woman without her consent at a Butlins holiday camp after putting her to bed following a night out with friends.

But he was acquitted after claiming to have a sleep disorder that causes him to have sex unintentionally.

Breaking down in court, he said the case had been a nightmare and both he and the girl were victims. His lawyer said he had, in fact, been ‘a knight in shining armour’ to the victim.

The case is the latest of a growing number reaching the courts in which rape defendants have argued that they cannot be held accountable for their actions because they suffer from the unusual sleep condition, known as parasomnia or sexsomnia.

Machin, from Warsop in Nottinghamshire, met the girl during a seven-hour drinking binge at Butlins in Skegness on February 27, 2010.

She was on a weekend away with nine other women, some of whom knew Machin.

Having downed more than  20 alcopops and shots at an Eighties revival club night, the woman collapsed and was so drunk she could barely speak and could not stand up.

After helping her back to her chalet, a friend undressed her and left her with Machin, agreeing that he should stay the night in case she became ill.

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, then fell asleep but woke to find him naked in her bed having sex with her.

‘I was still drunk,’ she said. ‘I started to panic when I realised what was happening. I couldn’t think properly. I put my hands up and shouted to him to stop. I was shaking.’

Trial: Mr Machin admitted the 21-year-old woman did not consent to sex but he was cleared by jurors at Lincoln Crown Court after revealing he suffers from sexsomnia

Machin, who has been unemployed for 
four years after injuring his back, said he was ‘disgusted’ when he woke
up and realised what he had done.

He told Lincoln Crown Court he had 
been blighted by sleep problems for more than 25 years and that he 
regularly had sex with his long-term partner while asleep.

He said on the night in question he simply wanted to help the woman.

‘I just wanted to go to sleep. I didn’t know where I was when I woke up. I was all over the place,’ he said, in tears.

‘All I wanted to do was help her. I didn’t want to hurt her. I feel disgusted. It is difficult to describe how I feel.’

Machin’s partner, Denise Jacks, 38, said he had undressed her and had sex with her before while sleeping.

‘It’s like he’s hypnotised and someone’s got the remote control on. He’s disgusted with himself. He just can’t help it.’

His sister, Kathy Pickering, told the jury the condition runs in their family.

She said: ‘I have sleep sex. I 
discovered that when I was married. My husband told me about it. I’m not
aware. I’ve no recollection of what I’ve done or what I’ve said.’

Dr Irshaad Ebrahim, a psychiatrist 
from the London Sleep Clinic, told the court the condition often affects
those who have a family history of sleep disorders, including sleep 
walking.

Michael Auty QC, defending, said: ‘He was in so many ways a genuine knight in shining armour to this woman.

‘This is on any view an extremely unusual set of circumstances.

‘Parasomnia is real and for people who suffer from it, it is desperately real.’

Stephen Lowne, prosecuting, said Machin lied about the incident and knew that what he was doing was wrong.

The woman added: ‘If it was sex that I
wanted I would have gone out and found it and done it and not said a 
word to anybody, but I didn’t.’

Machin wept as the jury foreman read out the not guilty verdict, following three days of deliberation.

Later, he said: ‘I am deeply sorry 
for all the heartache and hurt that has been caused by the unfortunate 
set of circumstances that were beyond my control. There have always been
two victims in this case.

‘I am glad that the right decision 
has been made and now I can get on with my life, because the last three 
years have been a nightmare.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
