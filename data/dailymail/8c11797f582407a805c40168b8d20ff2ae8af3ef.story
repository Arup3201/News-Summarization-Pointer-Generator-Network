An Indian man who allegedly murdered and dismembered his French wife in their Mumbai flat did it in a fit of rage after she refused to give him money to spend on his mistress, police say.

Girish Kote allegedly beat his wife Madhuwanti to death after a row sparked when she refused to give him 20,000 rupees (£200) to spend on a girlfriend who worked in a nearby bar.

Mumbai police say he has confessed to murdering the French national and cutting her body into three parts, which he wrapped in plastic and stored in their kitchen and bedroom.

'Confession': Police say showroom salesman Girish Kote told them he beat his wife to death and chopped up her body after they rowed when he asked her for 20,0000 rupees (£200) to spend on his girlfriend

Victim: The body of Kote's wife, Madhuwanti, above, was found in pieces in the couple's fridge and bedroom

Khote is alleged to have told 
investigators that he had been having an affair with a woman who worked 
in a beer bar and used to ask his wife for money to spend on his 
mistress.

But on Tuesday 
afternoon, the day of the murder, it is believed that Madhumanti refused
to give him any more money and threatened to return to France, taking 
their two-and-a-half-year-old child with her.

Realising
all the property and bank accounts were in his wife's name and he would
lose everything if she left, Khote began hitting her and smothering her
until she was dead, police said.

An
officer from Mira Road police station, north Mumbai, told NDTV: 'In a 
panic, Khote called up his cousin and left for a nearby mall, leaving 
Madhumanti's body in the bedroom.'

Khote
is said to have bought knives, cotton, detergent and duct tape, before 
returning home to slice up his wife's body and pack the pieces into 
bags, two of which he stuffed in the refrigerator.

He
kept a third segment in the bedroom of their apartment.

Scene: The couple's flat on the 14th floor of Nakshatra Towers high-rise in Bhayandar, was searched by police

On guard: Police outside the couple's apartment block. Khote is said to have bought knives, cotton, detergent and duct tape, before returning home to slice up his wife's body and pack the pieces into bags

Anger: Locals react to news of the shocking case by running towards the door of the apartment block

According to 
police, Kote was only arrested after he tried to call a taxi driver to 
help him move the body parts.

It is alleged that he called a driver who he was familiar with and told him what he had done.

But
instead of agreeing to move the body, the driver called police who 
rushed to the 14th-floor flat in Nakshatra Towers high-rise in the Bhayandar
and arrested the showroom salesman.

According
to local sources, the couple had frequent fights over money. Police say
Khote has confessed to the crime, saying he only intended to beat her, 
not kill her.
