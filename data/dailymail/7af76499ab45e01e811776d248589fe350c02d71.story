From folk-rock legends to reformed West African idols, WOMAD really is the place to find all the world’s music in a single weekend.

New Orleans brass bands, Peruvian psychedelists, jungle MCs, one-string bluesmen, cello-carrying troubadours… There’s even a duo playing scorching post-rock as an accompaniment to recordings from public information films.

The full line-up features around 100 artists from 40 countries performing over the festival weekend, including such luminaries as Youssou N'Dour, Bobby Womack, Alice Russell, Nitin Sawhney and Fat Freddy's Drop.

Bobby Womack will be a surefire pull for the mainstage this year. Very few of the great, great soul singers are still with us, a species nearing extinction with the dimming of the day.

A festival like no other: Families, teens, 40-something world music aficianados - everyone loves Womad

Charlton Park in Wilshire is the idylllic setting for tents, vans, campers and picnics for the weekend of July 24-27

But Bobby Womack is enjoying the golden, late-afternoon glow of a career that, while undeniably bumpy, has also touched glory on many occasions.

Over the last three decades, Youssou Ndour has achieved plenty: touring with Springsteen, Sting, Peter Gabriel and Tracy Chapman on the Amnesty International Human Rights Now! shows; scoring pop hits alongside Neneh Cherry, launching an unsuccessful presidential campaign back home in Senegal…

But one of the most notable observations of such a highly colourful, extraordinarily successful career is the preservation of that voice, which is as keen and insistent as it ever was.

Richard Thompson is back by popular demand while, right, English folk singer Kathryn Williams also makes a welcome return to the stage

Groovin on a sunny afternoon: The crowd at Womad are a friendly, enthusiastic bunch

Recently the third wave of performers has been confirmed and includes Richard Thompson, Amjad Ali Khan, Kathryn Williams, and Public Service Broadcasting.

From his teenage years in the embryonic Fairport Convention to his impeccable 30-year career as a solo artist, Richard Thompson has been a colossus in the kingdom of folk-rock.

A peerless guitarist and a biting lyricist, it’s been a long time since he was last welcomed to a WOMAD stage.

Meanwhile aficionados of classic-era West African bands will be pleased by a strong line up, including the reformed Les Ambassadeurs.

Amjad Ali Khan, renowned Sarod player with his sons Amaan and Ayaan will inject wonderful Indian music into the mix

No introduction needed: Fat Freddy's Drop will add in their inimitable style to the Womad vibe

After huge solo success, Salif Keita will once again be fronting them at Charlton Park.

There's a fine tradition of British female singers taking soul music back to its American source. Dusty Springfield was the first, followed in more recent times by Amy Winehouse. Brighton's own Alice Russell is the latest - her smouldering track Breakdown will stay with you long after this gig ends.

Admirers of Indian classic music are catered for with Amjad Ali Khan, arguably the foremost master of the sarod, the Hindustani stringed instrument. He will be accompanied by his sons Amaan and Ayaan, both distinguished sarod players themselves.

One of the most interesting projects to rise out of the UK music scene in recent years is Public Service Broadcasting, the inventive duo who use the narration of public information films to create stirring soundscapes.

The 14-legged reggae-soul groove machine that is Fat Freddy's Drop will also draw the crowds.

'We're a motley bunch of dudes, really. We're all from different backgrounds and different appreciations of music and styles,' says Mark Williams, aka MC Slave of the reggae-soul juggernaut known and saluted the world over as Fat Freddy's Drop.

Stylish: Alice Russell, left, soul singer extraordinaire hails from Brighton and will please the crowds with her slinky soulful voice. Right: 'Can I have my toy back now mum?'

Another inventive combo to emerge of late is the Mercury-nominated Dave Omuku & The Invisible, who make their WOMAD debut in the company of Noisettes singer Shingai Shoniwa and a 40-strong choir for a vocal-based performance entitled Stars Align.

British singer Kathryn Williams, fresh from rave reviews for her latest album Crown Electric also graces the main stage.

Congo Natty was one of the original jungle pioneers and, a couple of decades on, the MC is still defiantly telling it like it is, his lyrics both spiritual and street-wise.

One-third of reggae legends The Gladiators and a session musician at iconic Jamaican studios like the Black Ark and Studio One, Clinton Fearon is a roots-reggae veteran who’ll be playing both solo and with his diamond-hard outfit The Boogie Brown Band.

Arts and crafts: As well as a variety of workshops for children, resident crafty people will be on hand to keep little ones entertained

The answer is blowin in the wind: Around 40,000 people will be wandering the site enjoying themselves every day

With WOMAD attracting musicians and revelers from every corner of the globe, the festival also welcomes an amazing array of culinary backgrounds, and in 2014 will celebrate this annual fusion of flavours by becoming a foodie heaven in its own right.

Culinary institution the Taste the World Stage, and WOMAD’s poly-ethnic range of food traders will this year be joined by a new Taste the World Restaurant and a Children’s Cookery Workshop.

A live cookery session comes with lively discussion, a party atmosphere and, more often than not, ends with an impromptu gig.

Local, seasonal, wild and natural food will come from all around the globe, using the best ethically sourced ingredients.

Quite apart from the big name players, one of the delights of WOMAD is being able to make a journey without maps, to wander around the site to wherever the music guides you.

Such intrepid exploration will doubtless uncover some new musical heroes.
