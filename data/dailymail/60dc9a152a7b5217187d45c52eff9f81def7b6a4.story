Tests on fluids from Yasser Arafat's body revealed 'unexplained' higher levels of polonium 210

Former Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat may have been poisoned to death with radioactive polonium, scientists in Switzerland have revealed.

Arafat died in France on November 11, 2004, at the age of 75, but at the time doctors were unable to specify the cause of death.

Experts revealed that several belongings and items of clothing belonging to Arafat, including his toothbrush, hat and underwear, contained high 'unexplained levels' of the radioactive material.

The material is the same as that used to murder former Russian spy Alexander Litvenenko in London in 2006.

Arafat, who died after falling ill at his headquarters in the West Bank, showed symptoms of nausea, stomach pain and kidney and liver failure - signs consistent with radiation poisoning.

But the lack of hair loss or a shortage of bone marrow casts doubt on that theory, the scientists admit.

Much rumour had surrounded Arafat's death after doctors couldn't identify how he died.

Suggestions ranged from the aspersion that he had died from HIV to claims that rivals had poisoned him.

Speculation continued unabated when his widow Suha initially refused a post-mortem examination on her husband's body.

But she changed her mind and asked judges in France last year to launch a murder probe into her husband's death, claiming he was poisoned because he was an 'obstacle to peace'.

Experts at Lausanne's Radiation Physics Institute have now released details of the tests which 'support the possibility' he did not die of natural causes.

The tests were ordered by Arafat's widow Suha (pictured together), who believes her husband was killed because he was 'an obstacle to peace'

A statement said: 'Several tests on 
samples of bodily fluids contained an unexplained higher level of 
polonium 210, compared to control samples.

'These findings support the possibility of Arafat's poisoning with polonium 210.'

They examined 37 items of Arafat's clothing and compared levels of polonium with a similar number of uncontaminated items.

Computer projections, which estimate the speed at which the radioactive material breaks down, suggested that the levels of polonium 210 would have been consistent with a 'lethal ingestion' in 2004.

The
 team, whose findings are published in British medical journal The 
Lancet this week, said they regretted that no post-mortem investigation 
was carried out after Arafat's death.

Polonium breaks down quickly in the human body and is difficult to trace if there is a delay.

Remembered: Arafat remains a Palestinian national hero and his tomb is still a site of political pilgrimage

The researchers
 added: 'An autopsy would have been useful in this case because although
 potential polonium poisoning might not have been identified during that
 procedure, body samples could have been kept and tested afterwards.'

Mrs
 Arafat's lawyer Pierre-Olivier Sud told the French media last year: 
'Suha Arafat hopes that the authorities will be able to establish the 
exact circumstances of her husband's death and uncover the truth, so 
that justice can be done.

'She and her family want the truth and 
nothing but the truth. There is no question of any ideological or 
political exploitation.'

Mrs Arafat also told Arabic TV channel Al Jazeera in July 2012 that both the US and Israel had regarded her husband as 'an obstacle to peace'.

She added: 'I want the world to know the truth about the assassination of Yasser Arafat.'

Arafat had been confined by Israel to his headquarters in Ramallah when he fell ill in October 2004.

He was then given permission to be taken to the Percy military hospital near Paris, telling aides before he left: 'God willing, I will be back.'

But less than a month after arriving, he slipped into a coma and died on November 11, 2004.

Doctors who treated him said at the time he may have died of a blood clotting disorder and ruled out poisoning.

French daily Le Monde reported at the time that it had 'very good sources' who had revealed he died of a condition called disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

It described the condition as 'the complete disruption of the mechanisms which normally assure proper blood clotting and can lead to major internal bleeding and possible death'.

The paper quoted one doctor as saying: 'We also worked on the question of poisoning, using sophisticated techniques, before concluding with a negative.'

While Palestinians say that any evidence that Arafat was poisoned would suggest that Israel was somehow involved, an Israeli Government spokesman has rubbished those suggestions.

Polonium-210 was used to kill former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006

Alexander Litvinenko, a 44-year-old ex-KGB officer who had defected from Russia to the United Kingdom in 2000, was killed by polonium 210 in 2006 in London.

He had been admitted to hospital with severe abdominal pains a month before his death, which were initially diagnosed as caused by thallium, a toxin used in Russian rat poison.

Since thallium was supposedly a favourite poison of the KGB in the Cold War era and Litvinenko was an outspoken critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, it was initially believed Litvinenko might have been the victim of the FSB, the Russian security service that took over from the KGB.

He died in November 2006, leaving behind a deathbed statement accusing Putin of orchestrating his murder.

But hours before his death medical tests revealed that the fatal poison was not thallium but polonium-210, a critical component in the making of early-stage nuclear bombs.

A russian secret service agent was blamed in Press reports for the poisoning as he had met with Litvinenko at a London hotel just before he fell ill.

It was alleged that the agent had slipped the polonium into Litvinenkoâ€™s tea.

But it later emerged that traces of the isotope were found at a sushi bar that Litvinenko had visited before meeting the agent.

The mystery surrounding his death remains and his murder has never been solved.
