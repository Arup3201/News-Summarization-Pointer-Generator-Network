A bus driver who has been off work with depression for seven months after the sudden death of his daughter following childbirth has been sacked.

Robert Parkisson, 62, from Greater Manchester, lost his child Lisa, 35, last June, just two days after she gave birth to her son Zac.

Mr Parkisson was diagnosed with reactive depression and has been on sick leave ever since but has lost his job for failing to give bosses a date for his return.

He said: 'I understand that I will have to return to work at some point, but at the moment it just isn't possible. I wish the company would understand that and be a bit more supportive.

'When I'm behind the wheel and I'm carrying a bus full of passengers, I'm responsible for their safety.

'But, with how I feel at the moment, I just couldn't drive the bus. Sometimes I lose concentration and drift, sometimes I just break down into tears'. 

Seven months to the day since Lisa's death, Mr Parkisson claims he was handed 90 days' notice by First Group and told he was losing his job for failing to tell them when he will be returning to work.

Mr Parkisson, who has worked at First for more than 10 years, said: 'It is a disgusting way to treat someone while they are grieving for their daughter.

'I'm just a number to them. All they care about is me coming back to work.

'They don't care about me as a person. It is so disrespectful to my daughter's memory.'

Mr Parkisson spends his time with his ex-wife, Lisa's mother Judith Smith, and her sister Ally Ziemniak.

He added: 'The whole family is still grieving we rely on each other to get through each day. We are all devastated.'

Lisa, from Derker, gave birth via a Caesarean section, but was found unconscious by a midwife early on the morning of June 23, two days after giving birth.

A team of eight medical professionals were unable to revive her.

Her family paid a heartfelt tribute to Lisa, a cruise consultant with Cruise 118, in the week following her death.

Much loved: Lisa, 35, (pictured) was described as a a 'beautiful and funny' girl who had an 'infectious personality'

Loss: Lisa gave birth to Zac following a Caesarean section but was found unconscious by a midwife early on the morning of June 23, two days after giving birth

They described her as a 'beautiful and funny' girl who had an 'infectious personality'.

Her baby son is being cared for by her sister Ally in Watersheddings and is growing into a healthy, happy little boy.

His granddad said he is proud of the way the youngster is developing and the pair share a close bond - as well as a name, as Lisa gave her son  Mr Parkisson's middle name. 

Mr Parkisson said: 'First Bus keep asking me for a date to return to work but I just can't give them one.

'When I'm behind the wheel and I'm carrying a bus full of passengers, I'm responsible for their safety.

'But, with how I feel at the moment, I just couldn't drive the bus. Sometimes I lose concentration and drift, sometimes I just break down into tears.

Family: Zac's grandmother Judith holds him on the day he was borm. Mr Parkisson's who family are supporting him as he deals with his depression 

'I can't control it and each day is different to the next.

'I've spoken to three doctors, my own and two that were sent by the company, and they all agree that I am just not able to give a return to work date. 

The news of Mr Parkisson's job loss was made all the more difficult  as it came on the same day the family received the latest report into Lisa's death. 

Mr Parkisson said: 'The coroner's office have been very good with us, keeping us up to date with their inquiries as there are still further reports to be done.

'We have so many questions about Lisa's death but we are no nearer to any answers.

'Every few weeks when we receive a new report or a bit more information, the grief just hits us again. We are constantly being reminded of that day.

'But we have had barely any other support from anyone else and to find out that I've lost my job as well has just been too much for us all to take.'

A date for the inquest into Lisa's death has yet to be finalised as more reports are still to be prepared.

In a statement a spokesman for First Group said the company could not comment on Mr Parkisson's case but added that it does have polices in place to support and engage with employees after a bereavement.

The spokesman said: 'We cannot comment on individual cases but we do follow very clear and supportive policies in such cases.

'We absolutely recognise the support required when our colleagues suffer close bereavement.

'Such support includes a company confidential support line, counselling services and face-to-face meetings at work or at home as well as trade union support.'
