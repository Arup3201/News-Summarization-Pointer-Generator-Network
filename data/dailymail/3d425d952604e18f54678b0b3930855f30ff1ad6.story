Rio Ferdinand's Manchester United career is over after the veteran defender was informed that he will not be offered a new contract.

It is understood that Old Trafford chief Ed Woodward broke the news to Ferdinand, 35, in the dressing room following Sunday’s final game at Southampton.

Several people who were present at the time expressed shock that Woodward chose to bring down the curtain on Ferdinand’s 12-year stay at United in such a manner.

Signed: July 2, 2002

Fee: £29.1million

Total appearances: 455

Total goals: 8

Honours: Premier League (2002/03, 2006/07, 2007/08, 2008/09, 2010/11, 2012/13), Champions League (2007/08), League Cup (2005/06, 2008/09), Club World Cup (2008)

And in a statement on his personal website on Monday night Ferdinand said that ‘circumstances didn’t allow for me to say goodbye the way I would have liked’.

Less than 24 hours after the news broke and Ferdinand was in Singapore after being invited to a pre-World Cup event by a telecommunications company.

With United also agreeing to let central defender Nemanja Vidic go, Ferdinand’s former team-mate Gary Neville tweeted: ‘So it looks like Rio and Vida allowed to leave at once!!! A conveyor belt has become a cliff!’

The former England defender told team-mates that the 1-1 draw was his last game for the club on the flight back from St Mary’s and asked them to sign a match ball as a memento.

Ferdinand, who was the most expensive player in the history of English football when he joined United from Leeds for £29.1million in July 2002, made 455 appearances for the club but was marginalised under David Moyes.

A spokesman for Ferdinand said: ‘Rio intends to carry on playing football.’

The former West Ham player has offers on the table from America’s Major League Soccer, China and the Middle East, and will weigh up his options over the coming weeks.

In his statement Ferdinand said: ‘I am feeling fit and healthy, ready for a new challenge and looking forward to whatever the future holds for me.’

He thanked his team-mates, the club and the fans, adding that ‘after 12 fantastic years playing, for what I regard as the best club in the world, I have decided the time is right for me to move on’.

As part of
 the continuing changes at Old Trafford, Woodward is also understood to 
have told Chris Woods and Phil Neville — the only surviving members of 
Moyes’s backroom team — that their services will no longer be required 
when Louis van Gaal takes over. 

Van
 Gaal will finally be confirmed as United’s new boss this week but will 
remain at Holland’s training base 60 miles outside of Amsterdam ahead of
 the weekend friendly against Ecuador.

In an interview about his 
philosophies and principles Van Gaal appeared to offer encouragement to 
Ryan Giggs, the club’s interim manager, and captain-elect Robin van  
Persie in terms of their futures at Old Trafford.

‘When I go to a new club, I always want to keep one coach from the existing staff,’ he said.

‘As
 for the captains, I choose the captain, not the players. I have to 
admire him because of his personality, his identity. My captains are 
very professional, but also very ambitious and honest. You can see these
 qualities in the captains I have chosen.’
