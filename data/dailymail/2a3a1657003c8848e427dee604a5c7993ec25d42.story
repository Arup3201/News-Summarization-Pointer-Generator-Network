A Utah reporter passed out on live television but remarkably came to and continued her report like nothing had happened.

KUTV’s Brooke Graham passed out Saturday during a live report about cross-country skiing but sat up and continued the interview without missing a beat.

Ms Graham claimed in a later blog post that she often passes out in cold weather and high altitudes, but feels it may be time to figure out why.

Right as rain: KUTV reporter Brooke Graham starts off normally

The shot starts out fairly normal, with Ms Graham standing on a pair of cross-country skis and chatting with two people about taking up the hobby.

Things soon go awry as she becomes a little wobbly on her skis.

The man next to Ms Graham tries to catch her as she collapses, but she instead falls straight back and lands with a thud in the snow.

Out for the count: Ms Graham looks like she's done for

She soon sits up and claims she 'slipped and fell' and continues the report as the man takes off her skis.

Ms Graham attempted to explain the unusual sequence of events in a Monday blog post.‘I passed out during my live shot this Saturday…’ she wrote. ‘This is not the first time I have passed out cold.

‘I am known to faint any time I am in high altitudes and get too cold,’ she explained. ‘So this week I plan to go get checked out by a doctor and get to the bottom of it.’

Ms Graham recalled that she warned her producer she was getting light headed and beginning to feel sick, but soldiered on.

Resilient: But she pops back up and continues on like nothing happened

‘After I went down I sat up and had no idea how long I had been out but saw the camera pointed at my face and decided to keep on talking!’

She seemed no worse for wear, and even admitted to laughing at the video herself.
