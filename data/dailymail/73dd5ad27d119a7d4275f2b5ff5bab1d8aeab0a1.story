When Nick Clegg walked out of today's farcical ‘yellow budget’ speech, it prompted relentless jeers from Labour MPs - and left Danny Alexander speaking to a virtually-empty chamber.

And, to add insult to injury, the Deputy Prime Minister's swift exit appeared to be for the sole purpose of trying his hand at a spot of Am-dram in Gravesend.

As these pictures show, the Liberal Democrat leader was this afternoon seen sauntering around Kent, taking selfies with residents and high-fiving passers-by as part of a 'fun' film shoot for a party political broadcast.

'Fun': The Deputy Prime Minister said he did not want the election campaign to be too 'po-faced' and serious

Wearing dark woollen gloves, an open-neck shirt and a navy v-neck sweater, Mr Clegg looked right at home as he laughed and joked with residents, putting on his best smiling face for the cameras and occasionally treating them to an embrace.

There were even reports that he interacted with dancing girls for the film.

At one point, Mr Clegg opted for an outfit swap, changing into a camel-coloured jacket, which he matched with a more severe facial expression, as he walked solo along the high street.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the political broadcast is not the first time that Mr Clegg has attempted some amateur acting.

The politician is said to have enjoyed Am-dram at school, taking the lead role in The Government Inspector while at Caldicott.

At Westminster,  he took the lead in The Changeling, opposite Hollywood actress in-the-making Helena Bonham Carter. 

In one scene, she had to kick him between the legs - and one night she hit the target rather too authentically. 'She got it spot on… no acting was required,' Clegg recalls.

He also once donned a purple velvet jacket to play Charles Condomine in Noel Coward's Blithe Spirit - a man who boasts about his sexual conquests.

Swap: He even opted for an outfit change halfway through filming, reverting to a camel-coloured jacket

Strutting his stuff: Mr Clegg is a seasoned amateur actor and took the lead role in The Government Inspector while at Caldicott

Speaking to KentOnline about today's filming, Mr Clegg said: 'It's a bit of fun. I want to have fun in this general election campaign. I don't want it to be too po-faced and serious.'

Asked why the party decided to shoot the video in Gravesend, he added: 'It was just a really great place to do this and hopefully not cause too much disruption.

'Everybody in the shops here have been really warm and really generous with their time.'  

A Lib Dem source said: 'We were filming bits of a party political broadcast and other videos that are going to be used in the campaign.

'The whole crew has been filming for a couple of days – Nick was there for a couple of hours today.

'But you'll just have to wait and see what's in them.'
