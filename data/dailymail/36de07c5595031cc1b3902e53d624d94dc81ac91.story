Fancy views of Melbourne's midnight fireworks on New Year's Eve and the use of your very own beach all-year-round?

Maybe it's time to move to Clifton Springs for a slice of your very own piece of paradise.

Located on an elevated seaside block Ballerine Peninsula, south-west of Melbourne, is a five-bedroom home on sale for the first time since it was built back in 1978.

Up for auction this month, the home is  expected to fetch about  $1.5 million, which may well be considered by many a buy of a lifetime when you consider what's included.

The five-bedroom home was built in 1978 by the same couple who live in it today

The home is one of a handful of neighbouring properties with a private beach and a path which leads to it

But of couse, the most amazing feature of all in the five-bedroom property is its location, perched 30-metres above the ocean with its own zig-zagging path winding down to the water's edge.

Both the path and the beach are completely private, and there's a boatshed that juts out into the shallows, which the owners, Pam and Barry Whitford, built themselves. 

There's also a pavilion on the cliff's edge and unobstructed views all the way to Melbourne, which is 100 kilometres away.

Pat Whitford said her home is one of only a handful of properties across the Ballerine Peninsula, and 20 in total in Victoria, that comes  equipped with a private beach.

'We're 90-feet above the waterline and we have our own zig zag path,' she told Melbourne's 3AW radio.

The beach is completely private, but the couple allow beach goers to swim and walk on the sand as they please.

Mrs Whitford said the beach is protected and safe enough for children play in, and there's even your very own boatshed to house water craft. 

Set on more than 3700 square metres of land the home itself  offers three expansive living areas, a rumpus room with built in bar, and a formal lounge with combined dining.

Built by the Whitfords in 1978, the couple are the only two people who have ever lived in the house.

Clifton Springs is about 100 kilometres south west of Melbourne across from Port Phillip bay

There are five bedrooms, this with its very own private balcony

The home's north facing aspect is one of the its most desirable attractions 

Agent Nathan Ashton said the home is a rare find and is expected to sell for between $1.5 and $1.8 million 

They lobbied against the building of a nearby marina eight years ago, which is the only problem they've faced in 36 years, but it went ahead against their wishes.

They said they've rectified part of the problem caused by the marina - beach erosion - by building a groyne or permanent barrier to stop the shore line from eroding.  

She said the home is particularly attractive to prospective buyers because of its north facing aspect - a requirement fast becoming the number one asset people consider when buying a home on  Australia's east coast.

The point at which a home faces affects the amount of sun it receives, and north facing homes receive more light than most. 

Gartland Real Estate agent Nathan Ashton said the 3762 square metre property, on the Bellarine Peninsula at 39 Clifton Street, was a rare find.

'My understanding is there are only 11 properties on the Bellarine and seven on the Mornington Peninsula where the title extends into the ocean,' he said. 

He said interest for the October 11 auction has pushed the property's price tag to between $1.5 to $1.8 million.
