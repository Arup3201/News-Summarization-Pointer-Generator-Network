The Doers Network, led by Jesse Speer, pictured, carry out random acts of kindness across New York and America

They quiz subway passengers in New York 
for cash prizes, with questions including 'what colour is the sky?'.

It's members hand out 
free pizza to strangers and tape dollar bills to street signs beneath 
the tempting message, 'Grab One'.

Sound too good to be true? The Doers Network say there is no hidden agenda, no mailing list and no religious message - they thrive off the buzz of putting a smile on someone's face.

Led by 23-year-old Jesse Speer, members of the not-for-profit organisation, are bringing their random acts of kindness to the UK, expanding from their New York base.

Since its creation, the network has raised thousands of dollars in donations, and attracting intrigue and new members across America.

But UK domination is just the tip of the iceberg, with the network aiming to open branches all across the world

Mr Speer, who hails from Williamsburg in Brooklyn, said: 'I don't want it to be a charity, I just want to invoke a sense of kindness.

'Kindness has nothing to do with money - who's doing stuff for the people who have money but might be unhappy?

'Our tag line is it doesn't matter if you live on the street or if you own it, we have something for you.'

But he said, in spite of the positive, feel-good factor they promote, members of the group routinely face rejection from the public, who turn down the offer of free money or food, assuming it is too good to be true.

Members tour the subway in New York, quizzing passengers, challenging them with questions including, 'What colour is the sky?' in return for cash prizes

Members of the network tape dollar bills to street signs, underneath the tempting message, 'Grab One!'.

And in another random act of kindness the do-gooders are often spotted handing out free food. The network is planning to expand its kind-hearted gestures, starting a branch in the UK

But rather than discourage the do-gooders, who dress in branded Doers Network t-shirts, it is that skepticism that fuels their determination.

Mr Speer added: 'The point where I'll say I'm happy will be when the entire world knows who we are and what we do, and recognises our logo.

'I want to get to where Pepsi or Apple is, where you see the Doers Network smiley face logo with the tongue and think, I might be in a bad mood so I will change that.'
