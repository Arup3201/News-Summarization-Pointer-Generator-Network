Taylor Armstrong has been pictured in public for the first time since her estranged husband's apparent suicide.

The reality TV star was covered from top to toe, with just her legs visible as she visited the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Los Angeles, California.

Taylor, 40, wore a black hood, sunglasses and held a fur lined coat over her head in an attempt to avoid the glare of waiting photographers.

Her appearance came as his mother's lawyer confirmed Russell's ashes would be split between Taylor in Los Angeles and his family in Texas.

And Bravo, the U.S. network behind the show, is said to be hastily re-editing the footage in light of Russell's death, according to TMZ, although the website says an executive who spoke to them said no decision had been made about a premiere date. It had been previously scheduled to start on September 5.

Russell was in a state of panic over how he would be 
portrayed in the upcoming season of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills
before his suicide on Monday.

Speaking
out for the first time since he was found hanged on Monday, Russell's 
mother said he was deeply concerned about the candid footage Bravo had 
obtained, charting his marriage breakdown and money woes.

While
producers are now weighing how to proceed with the second season, John Ann Hotchkiss says her son 
feared TV makers were going to 'crucify' him.

She told Headline News: 'Before the 
new season even started, before he took his life, he said, "Mom, they’re
just going to crucify me this season".'

'He said, "I don’t
know what to do. I’ll never survive it".'

In
another interview with CNN HLN’s Jane Velez-Mitchell, Russell's mother 
also cautioned Bravo about airing any footage involving her son.

She said that the TV station: 'Better not air one frame of my son... or else!'

Her statement comes after members of the family have previously said that the reality show and Bravo is to 'blame' for Russell's suicide.

During an exclusive interview with 
RadarOnline.com, Russell's stepbrother Wade Jackson revealed that the 
family might sue the network.

'Bravo is at fault and somebody needs to pay,' he said.

'Russell’s whole family was very close and they’re considering suing Bravo.

'Russell’s dad doesn’t want to talk 
about what happened to him with a lot of people, but everyone in the 
family thinks that Bravo is to blame.'

TMZ have alleged today Russell sent a 'very threatening' email to Real Housewives co-star Camille Grammer after Taylor admitted that she had confided in Camille about  Russell's alleged physical abuse.

'Chilling': Sources claim Russell sent co-star Camille Grammer a 'threatening' email after Taylor confided in her about alleged domestic abuse

According to the website, multiple show insiders have claimed that Rusell beat Taylor so savagely at the start of season two that she required hospitalisation and surgery.

Her alleged injuries were so severe that Taylor couldn't show her face for weeks, but feared she would be fired from the reality series for being 'uncooperative and flaky.'

TMZ claim that Taylor confided in her co-stars Camille Grammer and Kyle Richards, who both urged her to tell Bravo the truth.

When Russell found out, he allegedly sent Camille a 'chilling' email that read like 'the rantings of a lunatic,' sources told the website.

Russell's lawyer Ronald Richards told ABC News that his former client was also in debt to the tune of $1.5m. 

He added that the reality show's celebration of outrageous excess plunged him into debt as he tried to keep his family's lavish lifestyle afloat.

'These couples join these shows, and then they keep trying to outdo each other and they end up spending all their money trying to sustain a lifestyle that’s unrealistic and wasn’t there prior to the show,' Richards said.

'The weekly social events, the dinners and all the bulls***, trying to pretend you have unlimited resources in Beverly Hills is tough.

'When every night is a potential sound bite or posting on a website, you end up getting addicted to it, you go out all the time.'

Taylor is still said to be 'devastated' over the news and is grieving behind closed doors.

A source told People.com: 'Taylor is behind closed doors, surrounded by her family. She's with Kennedy.'

The news comes after U.S. TV 
network Bravo, which makes the Real Housewives reality show, reportedly held crisis talks yesterday.

According to RadarOnline, executives spoke to Taylor's castmates at fellow star Adrienne Maloof's Beverly Hills mansion.

The show has been thrown into 
disarray, with a question mark over what footage to show of Taylor 
working through their marriage troubles - which was all captured on 
camera.

A source revealed: 'The people at 
Bravo just want to do the appropriate thing. Their first priority is 
being respectful to Russell, Taylor 
and their families.'

The website reports that producers asked the housewives not to talk to the Press about Russell, who was found dead on Monday.

Going ahead: Bravo executives are deciding whether season two of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills will air next month on schedule

Today it was revealed that the network were going to delay the premiere of the show for 'at least one week'.

The premiere party for the Bravo show, which was scheduled for August 24, has now been cancelled.

In any case, it was also reported today, Russell's forthcoming funeral will not be taped for any upcoming episodes.

A promo for the show was released last month for the upcoming season, featuring Taylor, 
Camille Grammer, Kyle and Kim Richards, Lisa Vanderpump and Adrienne 
Maloof.

In the preview, Taylor was shown crying over the demise of her marriage to 
Russell, with whom she has a five-year-old daughter, Kennedy.

Meanwhile, it has emerged that Russell could have been dead for more than 24 hours before his body was discovered at a home he was staying at in Mulholland Drive, Los Angeles.

According to TMZ the last known contact he had was on Saturday when he talked to a friend on the phone.

Taylor could now be left footing the bill for the debts they got into during their marriage, RadarOnline reports.

It may force the former surgical sales representative to go back to work in order to be able to provide for their five-year-old daughter.

There are also fresh reports today, stating that Russell and Taylor were living in a rental house in the Bel Air Crest area of Los Angeles when the second season of the show started filming.

Having moved out of their Beverly Hills mansion, they down-sized to a $9,000-a-month home, their lawyer told RadarOnline.

The location not as upscale as Bel Air or indeed Beverly Hills, where her co-stars live in huge mansions.

In the months leading up to his suicide, Russell was accused of physical assault by Taylor.

It emerged today that she had to have re-constructive on her face after Russell allegedly assaulted her during a heated row back in June.

He was also fearful over a tell-all-book, which was set to lift the lid on the fact he was rumoured to be bisexual, something Taylor confided in a friend after finding gay websites on his laptop's browsing history.

Russell is survived by five-year-old 
Kennedy, Aiden, a 13-year-old son from a previous marriage and a an 
11-year-old son with former fiancée Milette Fields.
