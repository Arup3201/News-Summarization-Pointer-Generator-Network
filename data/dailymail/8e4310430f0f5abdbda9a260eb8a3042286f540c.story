A 34-year-old Pennsylvania man who was a fitness fanatic and was taking dietary supplements, died from a massive heart attack.

Todd Battuello appeared to be in great shape, yet just weeks after using the 'fat-burning' diet pill OxyElitePro, he collapsed after dining with his wife.

His family are now suing the makers of the drug that MrÂ Battuello was taking after learning the Food & Drug Administration had ordered a batch of the pills to be 'destroyed' earlier this year.

Todd Battuello: He was described as a 'fun and hardworking barn manager' - despite his healthy appearance, Todd suffered a heart attack a weeks after starting to take dietary supplements

Mr Battuello  died on May 15th last year, just a week after he and his wife Lauren celebrated their first wedding anniversary.

The couple had just finished dinner when he began to feel sick and began convulsing before collapsing.

He was pronounced dead a short time later at Chester County Hospital.

Miracle cure? OxyElite Pro claims to target the 'stubborn' belly fat that is difficult to shift. Yet even in early 2012 there were cases of users suffering heart attacks after taking the product

OxyElite Pro was the fat-burning supplement that Mr Battuello had been using in the weeks leading up to his death.

The pill claims to remove 'stubborn' belly fat around the belly in particular.

The family told Philly.com they have filed a lawsuit earlier this month against USPlabs, the Dallas-based company that produced OxyElite Pro, and Bodybuilding.com, an Idaho-based company that sold the product on its website.

USPlabs has come under fire from the FDA, which earlier this month ordered the company to destroy its entire inventory of OxyElite Pro.

In April, the FDA warned consumers on 
its website that both supplements contained a stimulant called 
dimethylamylamine (DMAA), which 'can elevate blood pressure and could 
lead to cardiovascular problems, including heart attack, shortness of 
breath and tightening of the chest . . . and may be particularly 
dangerous when used with caffeine.'

According to the lawsuit, a warning label on the OxyElite Pro bottle indicated that the supplement did contain caffeine.

The family's lawyer Tom Kline said a toxicology test showed that Mr Battuello had DMAA in his system when he died.

Lawsuit: Todds' wife, Lauren, is now suing ths website that sold the dietary supplements claiming there should have been more explicit warnings over the dangers of using the drug

Although a warning not to mix DMAA and caffeine is posted on the website now, the lawsuit alleges that USPlabs is to blame for Mr Battuello's death because the product did not give a warning to customers of the potential dangers or risks to health.

USPlabs claim the supplement is 'pharmacist formulated' and 'university studied,' stating the product must be used with 'extreme caution, only by healthy adults capable of handling its true power.'

The family are seeking more than $75,000 in damages.

Jacob Geissler, USPlabs CEO, has not responded to MailOnline's request for a comment.

This is not the first time that the stimulant DMAA has come under the spotlight.

In February 2012, two U.S. Army soldiers had fatal heart attacks during training exercises.

At the time, USPlabs told the New York Times: 'there have been over 1 billion doses of DMAA-containing products taken without a single corroborated serious health problem.'

Mr Kline says the OxyElite Pro from Bodybuilding.com was ordered by Mr Battuello who was into physical fitness: 'but he had no idea how dangerous this product was.'

On the website of the Pennsylvania horse-training company the couple ran, Evolution Training Center, Mr Battuello is described as the 'hardworking barn manager who fell in love with farm life.'

His role involved maintaining the property and taking care of the horses each day.

Mr Battuello and wife Lauren were high-school sweethearts who had been together for nine years before getting married.

Mr Battuello's lawyer paid tribute to his client saying: 'He was a wonderful, loving young man who had his whole life ahead of him. He was an exceptionally warm, generous human being, and his life was destroyed by a drug that ended up being destroyed on an order from the FDA.'
