A farmer was killed after his shoe lace became wrapped around a rotating blade and he was dragged into a barley silo.

Sheep breeder Jim Sharp, 66, from Lauder in the Scottish Borders, suffered multiple injuries after entering a barley silo which contained several feet of barley.

A fatal accident inquiry heard he died at his farm, Newbigging Walls, on March 17 after his boot lace wrapped around the metal auger and he was pulled through.

Mr Sharp was a prominent breeder of Blackface sheep and a former livestock convener of NFU Scotland.

He was also a former captain of Melrose Rugby Club.

In a statement read out in Selkirk Sheriff Court, Sergeant Graeme Shearer described how he found Mr Sharp's damaged clothing wrapped around the screw.

He concluded that a boot lace was the first thing that had become entangled with the rotating blade.

Hazel Dobb, an inspector with the Health and Safety Executive, said the electricity supply should have been isolated before the silo was entered to remove the power from the auger.

She added that because Mr Sharp was self-employed with no employees no enforcement action was required.

Summing up, procurator fiscal Louise Graham said: 'The cause of the accident is that Mr Sharp appears to have entered the grain silo, but there is no evidence as to why that is the case.

'There may well have been a problem with the sweep auger on that date. 

'When in the grain silo, his boot lace became entangled with the sweep auger.'

She said it was not known how the lace came into contact with the metal auger.

Delivering his determination, Sheriff Peter Paterson said the cause of death was multiple injuries after Mr Sharp's body became entangled with the auger.

He made no recommendations.

Sheriff Paterson extended his sympathies to Mr Sharp's wife, Obie, and two children who were in court for the 15 minute hearing.
