A detective who says she was made a scapegoat for a mishandled investigation into the murder of a teenage girl is suing police for up to £500,000 in the High Court.

Jan Beasant was forced to quit her job after Lancashire police failed to bring anyone to justice over the disappearance of  14-year-old Charlene Downes, who was groomed by a child sex gang linked to takeaway food shops in Blackpool.

The teenager’s body has never been found.

Two men were charged with murder, but former Detective Sergeant Beasant was blamed for the collapse of the case because of the poor quality of surveillance tapes that formed a crucial part of the evidence.

Ms Beasant, 48, won an appeal against a disciplinary hearing ruling that her conduct in the investigation fell below the standard expected.

Her lawyers say Lancashire police ‘knowingly or with reckless indifference’ accused her of a lack of integrity.

Police believed Charlene was a member of a group of young girls who had sex with older men in return for gifts before she vanished in 2003.

When a supergrass named two men allegedly involved in Charlene’s murder, they were secretly bugged.

DS Beasant listened to the tapes and spent two years writing up their conversations. But the Crown Prosecution Service said there were  ‘grave doubts’ over the quality of the recordings and accuracy of transcripts.

Lancashire Constabulary was not available to comment.
