Paris Saint-Germain sealed a spot in the quarter-finals of the Champions League despite being reduced to 10 men after just 31 minutes on Wednesday night.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic's harsh dismissal did not prove to be costly as his team-mates beat the odds to score two crucial away goals at Stamford Bridge.

Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney took to Twitter to heap praise on the Ligue 1 outfit who, including extra time, played for 89 minutes with a numerical disadvantage.

'That is one of the best performances I've ever seen with 10 men from PSG,' said Rooney.

Former Premier League stars Luis Garcia and John Heitinga also lauded the 10 men of PSG for giving their all until the final whistle despite losing a key player during the first half.

Here, Sportsmail recalls other examples of when teams have impressed despite at least one of their players heading into the dressing room for an early bath. 

10 - St Mirren 0-1 Rangers (March 2010)

Cup finals are always tense affairs due to the pressure that surrounds both sets of players in the quest to land a piece of silverware.

Kevin Thomson and Danny Wilson were unable to control their emotions as they were sent off for dangerous tackles. Rangers added the 2010 Co-operative Insurance Cup to their trophy cabinet after Kenny Miller saved Thomson and Wilson's blushes by scoring a late winner.

9 - Chelsea 4-1 West Ham (April 2006)

One goal down with a man sent off, Chelsea looked in danger of dropping points in their home fixture against West Ham.

James Collins opened the lead in the 10th minute before Maniche's 17th-minute dismissal for a lunge on Lionel Scaloni. However Jose Mourinho's 2005-06 side had a never-say-die attitude. Didier Drogba, Hernan Crespo, John Terry and William Gallas scored at Stamford Bridge to help their side to victory en route to a second successive Premier League title.

8 - Bolton 2-3 Arsenal (March 2008)

Arsenal were reduced to 10 men in the 31st minute when Abou Diaby received a straight red for an incredibly reckless challenge on Gretar Steinsson.

The Gunners were 2-0 down before the interval but Arsene Wenger's side showed great tenacity to claim a win at what was then called the Reebok Stadium thanks to goals by Gallas, Robin van Persie and a fortunate Jloyd Samuel own goal.

6 - Derby 0-1 QPR (May 2014)

Derby and Queens Park Rangers battled it out in a fixture worth £80million for the victors, knowing they will be promoted to the Premier League.

The Rams, already dominant, appeared to have been handed a major boost when Gary O'Neil was red carded for a late challenge on Johnny Russell. However being second-best all match, Bobby Zamora scored in the dying stages of the play-off final to seal promotion for QPR.

5 - Tottenham 3-4 Manchester City (February 2004)

Manchester City booked a place in the fifth round of the FA Cup back in the 2003-04 campaign by somehow coming back from three goals down to eliminate Tottenham.

Their task was made even harder when Joey Barton was sent off after picking up two yellow cards. However, while Barton was licking his wounds in the Manchester City dressing room, then team-mates Sylvain Distin, Paul Bosvelt, Shaun Wright-Phillips and Jon Macken scored past Kasey Keller to help City come back from the dead.

As mentioned above, Laurent Blanc will be delighted with the effort of his players following Ibrahimovic's early sending off.

3 - Arsenal 1-2 Manchester United (April 1999)

This incredible FA Cup fixture is mainly remembered for Ryan Giggs' incredible solo goal to send Manchester United into the FA Cup final and keep alive his side's dream of winning the treble.

But Manchester United's feat was even more impressive given they were reduced to 10 men in the 74th minute when Roy Keane received a second yellow for hacking down Marc Overmars. United were forced into playing the rest of normal time as well as extra time with 10 men but managed to find a way of breaking down Arsenal's resolute defence.

2 - Barcelona 2-2 Chelsea (April 2012)

Facing a Barcelona side including Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta and Alexis Sanchez was no easy task at the best of times.

Never mind after losing your inspirational captain at the Nou Camp in a Champions League semi-final. Chelsea looked destined to be heading out of Europe's most prestigious competition after John Terry's 37th-minute dismissal, however the Blues found a way of drawing 2-2 to seal a spot in the final, which they would go on to win.

1 - Argentina 0-1 Cameroon (June 1990)

An Argentina side including Diego Maradona were left stunned after the opening game of the 1990 World Cup as they were defeated 1-0 by Cameroon.

The African nation produced one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history despite losing Andre Kana-Biyik on the hour mark.
