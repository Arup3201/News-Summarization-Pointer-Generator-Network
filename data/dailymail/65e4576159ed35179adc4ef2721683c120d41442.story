A Nobel Peace Prize awarded to a pioneering politician for his attempts to patch-up international relations in the years before World War Two has been stolen.

The prize, awarded to former Foreign Secretary Arthur Henderson in the 1930s, was one item in a haul of items thought to be worth an estimated £150,000 to be stolen from the Lord Mayor's Mansion House, in the Jesmond area of Newcastle, Tyne and Wear.

A lock of hair from Admiral Lord Collingwood, who took over control of the British fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 after Admiral Nelson was killed, was also stolen in the raid.

Crime scene: Thieves are thought to have broken into the Lord Mayor's Mansion House through the basement overnight on Monday

Thieves are thought to have broken in through the cellar of the house overnight between Monday and Tuesday.

Among the other items stolen were silver cups dating back to 1919, a set of four Victorian star-embossed napkin rings from 1875, a William IV snuff box from 1834, a George II mustard pot from 1759 and a Queen Anne silver love cup embossed with her coat of arms.

Newcastle Temporary Superintendent Bruce Storey said: 'Some of the items taken in this burglary are very uncommon and we are asking the public to keep their eyes open for them.

'The Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded 93 times to 124 Nobel Laureates between 1901 and 2012 and so the stolen item is extremely rare, recognisable and historically important.'

Arthur Henderson's Nobel Prize is 
engraved with the words 'Parlimentum Norvegial A Munro Henderson' and is
in a leather display case.

It was awarded in 1934, just a year before Henderson's death.

Among
his attempts to prevent declining diplomatic relations, Henderson 
established links with the newly formed Soviet Union, entered Britain 
into the League of Nations and chaired the Geneva Disarmament Conference
between 1932 and 1934.

Unfortunately,
the conference was beset by disagreements, including what constituted 
'offensive' and 'defensive' weapons and talks broke down when Adolf 
Hitler withdrew Germany from the meeting and the League of Nations.

The
citation for Henderson's award says that he was 'among the bravest and 
most faithful' in his efforts to calm international tensions.

It praises his 'tact and unfailing courtesy and prudent reserve' and his 'indestructible endurance and never-ending patience.'

Admiral Lord Collingwood is much celebrated in his native North East for his long career at sea and a monument was erected in his memory at Tynemouth.

Born from humble origins - he was the illegitimate son of a manual worker - Arthur Henderson was born in Glasgow on September 13 1863.

His father died when Henderson was young and when his mother remarried when he was nine, the family moved to Newcastle.

At the age of 12, Henderson took a job as an iron moulder and soon became involved with trade unions.

He was one of the 129 delegates to found the forerunner of the Labour Party in 1900 and elected as the party's fourth MP in Barnard Castle in 1903.

By 1908, Henderson had become the leader of the Labour Party and made history seven years later when he became the first Labour Cabinet Minister in the wartime coalition government.

He was Home Secretary in the first Labour Government formed in 1922 and became Foreign Secretary under Ramsey Macdonald in 1929.

He spent the latter part of his career trying to defuse diplomatic tensions that were escalating prior to the start of the Second World War in 1939, holding talks with Germany.

He was awarded the Nobel Prize for his efforts in 1934.

But Henderson never lived to see peacekeeping efforts fail as he died a year later in 1935.
