Stifling: Professor Brown, who is director of the National Centre for Post Qualifying Social Work, warned that a target-driven approach was damaging to the nursing profession

A generation of nurses and carers have had their compassion ‘knocked out of them’ by a blindly target-driven workplace culture, an expert has warned.

An obsession with targets and jargon is stifling their innate desire to care for patients and care home residents, Professor Keith Brown said.

The professor, who is in the process of overhauling the training received by Britain’s care professionals, said many workers felt unable to stand up to abuse if they saw others mistreating patients.

He pointed to the example of the abuse
scandal at the Winterbourne View private hospital in Bristol, which he 
said showed how those not perpetrating abuse had found it easier to 
‘turn a blind eye’.

He 
said: ‘The vacuum has been in those situations, people lack a 
willingness to stand up and be counted and to do the right thing at the 
right time.

'That 
might be because they are afraid, or because of the culture, that if you
whistle-blow you will be in trouble, or it might be that they just 
don’t want the hassle.’

Professor Brown, who is director of 
the National Centre for Post Qualifying Social Work, added: ‘I think 
that most people who come into this line of work – whether it is 
nursing, social care, or in care homes –  want to care but somehow it 
gets knocked out of them.

‘They end up in systems and structures that make them feel anxious or nervous.

‘It might be the pressure of work or the
culture of the organisation just setting inappropriate targets where 
you can measure the measurable but not the qualities of what it feels 
like.’

Scandal: Professor Keith Brown referenced Winterbourne View private hospital in Bristol where abuse was exposed. He said staff often found it easier to 'turn a blind eye' to abuse and criticised target-driven workplace culture

Professor Brown told the Daily Telegraph there had been a growth in ‘daft’ targets within the care system.

He
said: ‘A lot of the leadership development through the whole sector is 
based on a business school type ideology, because we haven’t got a clear
leadership development framework based on social work or social care 
principles.

‘Instead of being taught how to care for people, they are being taught how to  meet targets.’

He
added: ‘Of course you are going to get the odd rogue but the million 
people involved in social care came in to it for good reasons, we need 
to switch that back on again.

‘We need to stop it being knocked out of them or crushed so that they don’t exercise it any more.

‘Experience is crushing it but maybe training should give then resilience to stop them being crushed.’

Abuse: An investigation exposed how vulnerable patients suffered terrible treatment. Professor Brown said: 'People lack a willingness to stand up and be counted and to do the right thing at the right time'
