Conor McGregor delivered a warning to Jose Aldo as he weighed in for his fight with Dennis Siver.

The Irishman tipped the scales at the featherweight championship limit of 145lb ahead of the clash at the TD Garden in Boston on Sunday night.

And after a tetchy face-off with his German opponent, McGregor had a few words for the long-reigning champion.

Conor McGregor weighed in on the featherweight limit for his fight with Dennis Siver in Boston on Sunday

McGregor is one victory away from a shot at the UFC title and is a heavy favourite to beat German Siver

'The Irish invasion continues,' he said. 'That's 145; that's championship weight. Tell Jose I'm coming.'

McGregor, who has won all four of his fights in the UFC, will take on Aldo if he comes through against Siver.

Dublin's Croke Park, with a capacity of more than 80,000 is one possible venue, as is Las Vegas.

Earlier in the evening, however, Aldo took the opportunity to remind McGregor just who reigns in the division.

'I'm the champion and he's the clown,' he said. 'After I beat him, I'm still the king and he's still the court jester.

'It's going to be really exciting time for me. Its going to be great to fight Conor McGregor in Ireland and it's going to be even more exciting for me to shut you guys up.

'I don't think he'll ever be ready for me. I've fought better opponents and more qualified opponents. 

'My prediction is that I'll beat him in every round and finish him.'
