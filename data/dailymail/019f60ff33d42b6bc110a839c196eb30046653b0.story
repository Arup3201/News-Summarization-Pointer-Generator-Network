Authorities arrested a shooter who injured a man this afternoon at the Dayton VA Medical Center. Police have identified the shooter as 59-year-old Neil Moore, a retired hospital employee who used to work in the housekeeping department.

Dayton Police Chief Richard Biehl says the incident happened around 12:10pm today in a break room in the basement of the building and that at least three people witnessed the incident.

Hospital employee Paul Burnside, 61, suffered a gun shot wound to his ankle fighting Moore for the gun, and Biehl says the two appeared to know each other. Burnside's injuries are non-life threatening and he is recovering at the hospital.

Suspect named: Police identified the shooter as retired hospital employee Neil Moore, 59, who used to work in the housekeeping department. Pictured above arriving at Montgomery County Jail Monday afternoon

Emergency: The incident happened around 12:10pm Monday afternoon in a hospital break room. After shots were fired, the hospital's lobby was evacuated and the rest of the building sent into lock down. Those evacuated from the building pictured above

An officer speaking on a police scanner after the incident said Moore 'came in looking for someone else to do harm to,
 didn't find him and fired at this guy'. Early reports indicate the 
shooting was domestic-related as the suspect's wife works at the 
hospital.

Moore was later arrested when his sister drove him to Good Samaritan Hospital, about six miles away from the VA center.

At Good Samaritan, Moore underwent a psych evaluation before police transported him to Montgomery County Jail.

As he was leaving the Dayton Police Department Monday afternoon, Moore apologized for his actions to WDTN reporters.

'I'm sorry for what I did. I didn't mean to,' he said as he was let out of the building by police officers.

He added that he was sorry 'to the people he hurt' and that it was an accident.

Moore may be a veteran himself since he was seen wearing a Marines letterman jacket walking into jail and police were initially searching for a suspect driving a GM truck with 'disabled vet' tags.

Police say they found Moore's revolver in his truck parked at his sister's house.

After the shots were reported, the 
hospital's lobby was evacuated and the rest of the building sent into 
lock down as SWAT teams searched the building room by room for the 
suspect.

The hospital will remain closed until police complete their investigation.

The hospital has beds for about 450 people and provides medical, mental health and nursing home care to veterans.

Today's
 incident echoes back to four years ago when Iraq War Army veteran Jesse S Huff shot himself at a soldier' monument at the hospital while wearing military fatigues.  Huff had been a patient there and 
was wounded by an explosive device while serving in Iraq.
