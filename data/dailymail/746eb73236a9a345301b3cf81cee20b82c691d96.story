A 40-year-old woman appeared in court today charged with murdering her two-year-old son.

Mother-of-three Angela Vane appeared before magistrates in Torquay charged with the murder of Shaun Riley O'Neill, whose body was discovered at home on Saturday morning.

Vane, of Champernowne in Modbury, Devon, spoke only to confirm her name, age and date of birth but wept throughout the two minute hearing.

Crime scene: A police officer stands outside the home in Modbury, Devon, following the death of Shaun O'Neil

Investigation: Police carried out door-to-door enquiries after the toddler's body was discovered

Wearing a beige cardigan and a striped top, the fair-haired defendant was flanked by two female security guards.

She was remanded in custody to appear at Plymouth Crown Court on Wednesday. She is expected to enter a plea in April, the court heard.

Police were called to Champernowne at 8am on Saturday after the boy's body was discovered by a member of the public.

Dozens of floral tributes were left outside the home, and officers carried out door-to-door inquiries and initial forensic work.

It is believed a post-mortem examination has yet to be carried out.

That process is expected to take place in the coming days by a Home Office pathologist or specialist paediatric pathologist.

Response: Officers arrived at the house in Devon at 8.20am on Saturday morning

Charged: Vane, of Champernowne in Modbury, spoke only to confirm her name, age and date of birth

Tribute: Flowers have been left close to the home where a toddler's body was discovered on Saturday

Meanwhile, detectives are continuing to piece together information and urged members of the public to get in touch if they can assist the inquiry.

One of the floral tributes is addressed, 'RIP, Little Man'. His father is Ryan O'Neill.

News of the boy's death spread through Modbury in the early hours of Sunday morning

Officers arrived at the semi-detached house on the Champernowne estate shortly after 8.20am, following the tragic discovery by a member of the public.

One neighbour said: 'He was a cracking little lad. He had ginger hair and was full of life. He was only out here on Friday throwing snowballs. This is devastating.'

Outside the house, shocked neighbours had left floral tributes, as well as a small brown teddy bear.

Goodbyes: One of the floral tributes is addressed, 'RIP, Little Man'

Shock: News of the boy's death spread through Modbury, Devon, in the early hours of Sunday morning
