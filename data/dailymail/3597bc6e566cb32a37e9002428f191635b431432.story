Increasing numbers of doctors are deserting the NHS for a better life in Australia and New Zealand, figures reveal.

The exodus of doctors – who cost the taxpayer up to £610,000 to train – is forcing the NHS to import staff from southern and eastern Europe.

According to a major report from the General Medical Council, the number applying for certificates to work abroad has risen by a fifth since 2008, to nearly 3,000 a year.

The General Medical Council says that doctors applying for certificates allowing them to work abroad has risen by a fifth since 2008, with those aged between 25 and 27 most likely to leave 

Just over half have applied to work in Australia and New Zealand, where the demands are less intense and doctors enjoy a better work-life balance. And doctors aged 25 to 27 are most likely to leave – making up one in five of those applying for certificates.

Figures also show that rising numbers of doctors are coming to Britain from southern and eastern European countries such as Greece, Italy and Romania.

But experts say the exodus of UK-trained doctors is putting patients at risk by creating too many vacant posts – particularly in A&E units and GP surgeries.

Only last week the Royal College of GPs warned that as many as 550 surgeries could close within the next year because doctors nearing retirement won’t be replaced.

Staffing shortages are made more problematic by the fact that a growing number of doctors are women, who tend to only work part-time after having children.

The GMC’s figures show that 44 per cent of doctors are women and they are expected to overtake men by 2017. 

Niall Dickson, chief executive of the GMC, said: ‘The face of medicine is changing. Of particular concern are the potential shortages in some specialist areas where there are diminishing numbers of doctors in postgraduate training and large numbers over the age of 50.

‘Recruitment in some parts of the UK, especially deprived areas and more remote communities, is also a significant challenge.’

Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: ‘The mass exodus of GPs – driven by soaring demand and plummeting resources – is a danger to patient safety. 

'On the one hand, GPs are leaving the profession due to intense pressure and a lack of support, and on the other, not enough medical students are opting for general practice because they see the pressure we are under.’

Figures from the GMC show that last year, about 2,900 doctors applied for a ‘certificate of good standing’, which allows them to work abroad, a rise of 22 per cent since 2008.

Some 51 per cent were for Australia and New Zealand, while 10 per cent were for Canada. 

The GMC insisted that not all doctors actually left after acquiring the certificate and many only went for a short period.

Last December, Dr Clifford Mann, chairman of the College of Emergency Medicine which represents A&E doctors, warned that the exodus of doctors was a ‘waste of taxpayers’ money’. He pointed out that each one has cost the taxpayer £610,000 over the ten years of their studying and training.

However, marginally more doctors are still joining the register than leaving. Last year, a total of 13,150 joined and 12,231 left – either through retirement, moving abroad or quitting the profession altogether.

The number arriving from southern and eastern Europe has doubled since 2008 to 1,840 last year. They represent 14 per cent of those joining the register – about one in seven. 

There are just under 270,000 doctors licensed to practise in the UK.
