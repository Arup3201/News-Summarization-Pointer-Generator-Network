From velvety crimson totes to structured nude shoppers, Victoria Beckham's pre-Fall handbag collection doesn't disappoint - provided, that is, you have plenty of cash to spare.

Beckham, who took home the Woman of the Decade award at last week's Glamour Awards, has been seen out and about with pieces from the new collection, although the rest of us have had to wait until today.

She said: 'Today I am introducing the first early drop of my accessories and Victoria, Victoria Beckham lines for autumn/winter 2013.

'These are the precursor to the launch of my first full pre collections for spring/summer 2014 that will be showcased to retailers this weekend in New York.

'These new capsule collections will enable me to offer my customer something new to buy throughout the year. I am very excited to be able to extend my seasonal product offer across all categories.'

The collection, which is available online at 
victoriabeckham.com, includes the 'Large Zip Pouch', in reality a small blood red leather 
clutch for £395, and the oxblood python 
'Victoria' bag which retails for an eye-watering £2,750.

New additions include the North/South
structured tote, which comes in a choice of crimson or oxblood, as well
as fresh colours for the classic 'Liberty' bag.

In an interview with PEOPLE magazine, she added: 'I design for a chic, modern and 
stylish woman who appreciates quality and luxury, as well as having the 
confidence to make what she wears her own.

'Bags and accessories are a natural 
complement to [my clothing lines]. I want to offer beautifully crafted 
pieces for every part of a woman’s wardrobe.'
