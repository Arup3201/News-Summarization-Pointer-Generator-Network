Alex Salmond suffered another painful loss to the Auld Enemy last night after watching Scotland comfortably beaten by bitter rivals England in Glasgow.

The First Minister quit as SNP leader after he lost the Scottish Referendum in September and spent the end of his final full day in office with 50,000 other fans at Parkhead last night and watched Roy Hodgson's side win 3-1.

Scotland were playing the old enemy on home turf for the first time in 15 years and Mr Salmond and the rest of the Tartan Army had hoped for a victory. 

But two goals from captain Wayne Rooney and a header by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was enough to beat Gordon Strachan's side.  

5,000 England fans were among the spectators at  Celtic Park to watch the friendly - the oldest fixture in international football.

There was a heightened police presence around the stadium, stations and city centre but there were no reports of major fighting between rival fans before, during or after the game, which has been marred by violence in the past.

But fans did drown out the respective singing of their national anthems and England supporters were heard singing anti-IRA chants during the match.

Police Scotland reported no football-related disorder in the immediate aftermath of last night's 3-1 victory to England and said they had not received any reports of offensive chants.

But in the first half, an FA official contacted the band to ask them to stop playing the tune for the chant.

After the game England manager Roy Hodgson said he was unaware of the song but apologised for any offence on behalf of the FA.

He said: 'I was aware the crowd were tremendously supportive. I didn't have a clue what they were chanting.

'I don't condone it. If anyone was offended, I'm sure the FA would like to apologise to them.

'All we can do is play our football and be grateful for the support and hopefully they will behave themselves and not get themselves into a situation where their chanting is being criticised.'

More than 200 people were arrested in 1999 when England took on Scotland at Hampden Park and police said ahead of the match that they were monitoring 'known troublemakers' from both countries who they believed were planning to attend. 

Scottish fans in kilts were in high spirits before the game - but have no doubt gone home disappointed

Around 5,000 visiting fans celebrated after Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain gave England the lead in the first half and Rooney went on to score twice.

A goal from Scotland's Andrew Robertson was not enough for Scotland to repeat their victory over Republic of Ireland at Parkhead on Friday.

Before the 8pm kick-off there was a minute's applause for Scotland supporter Nathan McSeveney who died at the match.

Supporters had mixed views on whether Scotland v England - the oldest fixture in international football - should resume as an annual event.

Tartan army member David McCann said: 'You can see from the build-up that it gets everyone interested and it makes a change from the usual boring friendly matches.

'But if it was played every year then I think they'd need to lower the ticket prices.'

England supporter James Ward said: 'I'm looking forward to it but I don't think it should be (played) every year, absence makes the heart grow fonder and all that.' 

The Celtic Park meeting in Glasgow saw the two sides go into the fixture with plenty of confidence, with England having won their last five games and Gordon Strachan's outfit going strong in their Euro 2016 qualifying group.

The meeting is a reverse fixture from last year at Wembley where the Three Lions won 3-2 thanks to a Rickie Lambert header in the second half. 

Police were seen keeping a watchful eyes on football fans and pictures from St Enochs in Glasgow city centre showed around 45 police officers kettle a group of football fans in a pub before escorting them to another pub.

Ahead of the game boos together with cries of 'come on England' met the England team buses as they arrived at Parkhead this evening, with manager Roy Hodgson and captain Wayne Rooney receiving the loudest reaction from supporters. 

Tributes to Nathan McSeveney, the Scotland fan who died following their match against the Republic of Ireland, are laid outside Celtic Park

The Scotland bus pulled up to loud cheers, applause and a rendition of Flower of Scotland from the large crowd that had gathered to see players arrive.

Sportsmail's Matt Barlow at Celtic Park said: 'Both teams have been out on the pitch to see a surface without American Football markings.

'England fans are decorating their end with St George flags. 

'There are very few Scotland fans inside Celtic Park at the moment, but enough to boo the ceremonial England flag which is being carried out and placed on the pitch.

'Outside is a sombre collection of scarves and flowers and messages in honour of the Scotland supporter Nathan McSeveney, who died at Friday's game against the Republic of Ireland.

'In the programme Gordon Strachan wrote: 'I would like to reiterate on behalf of the squad and my backroom team our deepest condolences to the family and friends of Nathan, who came to support his country and never returned home.'

Supporters outside the stadium were split over whether Scotland v England should be a permanent fixture once more.

Michael Kenny, who travelled by train from Preston, said: 'I think it means more to the Scottish fans and team but we obviously want to win. England haven't had too much to shout about in the last few years but beating Scotland would be one to enjoy. '

The last time the teams met in Scotland there were more than 200 arrests and police said they are monitoring 'known troublemakers' from both countries who they believe are planning to travel to today's game.

England defeated Scotland 2-0 at Hampden Park in the last match played between the sides in Glasgow in 1999. After almost 14 years, the rivalry was re-established last year when England won 3-2 in a friendly at Wembley.

There was also be a minute's applause before kick-off tonight in tribute to Scotland fan Nathan McSeveney who died after falling in a stairwell at Celtic Park during Friday's match against Republic of Ireland.

A Unicef appeal to help Ebola victims was broadcast before the match and at half-time, with the Government pledging to match donations made during the game up to £5 million.
