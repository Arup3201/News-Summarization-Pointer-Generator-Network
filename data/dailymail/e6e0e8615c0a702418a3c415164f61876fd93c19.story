'Sickening': CCTV shows Piara Purewal repeatedly stamping on the head of unconscious teenager Louis Mousset as the thug's friends Dale Walker and Lance Keating-Hutchinson pin him to the pavement

A thug who stamped on an unconscious teenager’s head ten times while his two friends pinned him face down to the pavement in a 'sickening' late-night attack has been jailed for seven years.

Piara Purewal, 22, attacked Louis Mousset, who was 18 at the time, in the early hours of September 9 last year.

The student, now 19, was walking with friends in Birmingham city centre when he was set upon by Purewal and his two accomplices, Dale Walker, 21, and Lance Keating-Hutchinson, 25.

The trio had been fighting with a group of other men and turned their attentions to Mr Mousset as he walked past.

Purewal punched him and knocked him out before Walker and Keating-Hutchinson held the unconscious teenager face down on the kerb, allowing Purewal to repeatedly stamp on his head.

After the shocking attack, which was captured on CCTV, Mr Mousset spent three days in hospital being treated for bleeding on the brain.

Surgeons feared he may lose sight in one eye but remarkably he went on to make a full recovery.

Purewal, of Hockley, Birmingham, was jailed for seven years and four months at Birmingham Crown Court yesterday after he admitted wounding with intent and assault.

Walker, also of Hockley, and Keating-Hutchinson, from Winson Green, Birmingham, were both jailed for two-and-a-half years after admitting inflicting grievous bodily harm and affray. Walker also admitted two charges of assault and Keating-Hutchinson one.

Caging the trio, Judge William Davis QC said: 'For no good reason they were set upon by the three of you.

'You were drunk. That no doubt had a good deal to do with it.

'One man could well have lost his life but it is purely good fortune that he didn’t.'

Prosecutor Blondelle Thompson told the court Louis had been in the city centre and was heading towards Broad Street in the early hours when the three thugs launched an unprovoked attack.

Louis was ahead of his two friends when he came across the trio fighting with another group of men, when they turned to attack him.

Purewal, Walker and Keating-Hutchinson went into hiding following the violent assault but were arrested by detectives following a public appeal.

Walker was arrested from a city centre address on October 25 and plain clothes officers arrested Purewal on December 12.

Keating-Hutchinson eventually handed himself in to police in Birmingham on January 24 this year.

Speaking after the sentencing, Detective Constable Sarah McDonnell, from West Midlands Police, branded the attack 'cowardly' and 'sickening'.

She said: 'The ferocity of the attack, the repeated, furious stamping, meant we could have been looking at a murder enquiry.

'The lad suffered nasty facial injuries, lost several teeth and it was thought he could lose the sight in one eye.

'Thankfully he made a good physical recovery but understandably he was traumatised by what happened.

'The victim was a totally innocent party. He got caught up in an incident not of his making and was understandably unhappy at being shoved to the ground.

'He approached Purewal and was punched unconscious and repeatedly stamped upon.

'He was lying prone, face down on the floor, and unable to defend himself.

'It was the most cowardly, sickening attack I’ve ever seen and Purewal has rightly been handed a long jail term for his actions.'
