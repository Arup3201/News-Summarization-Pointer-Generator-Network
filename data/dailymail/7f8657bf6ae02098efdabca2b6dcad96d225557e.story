When Sir Alex Ferguson left Manchester United after 27 years at the helm, he was sure he had left the club in good hands.

David Moyes was his personally selected predecessor, and though that didn't work out, he was sure to have approved Louis van Gaal's appointment given his track record.

But after a less-than-ideal start for the Dutch boss in charge, despite huge transfer fees being shelled out by United, it's time to look at the damning numbers.

Happy times: In Sir Alex Ferguson's final season in charge Manchester United's win rate was 67 per cent

Disappointing: But Louis van Gaal has struggled so far while David Moyes was sacked last season

New low: United lost 4-0 to MK Dons in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday night

We all know about Ferguson's record when it comes to trophies, while his win percentage was also mightily impressive at 67 per cent in 2012/13.

But after his departure, that rate has dropped down to 50 per cent with just 29 wins from Moyes (Van Gaal doesn't have one yet), from 58 games.

And it's not like United haven't been backed in the transfer market. Chief executive Ed Woodward, who replaced David Gill at the same time as Fergie's departure, has admitted it has been tough to attract big names but has still managed to pay out way beyond what Sir Alex was spending per season. In fact, United have spent £199.1million post-Ferguson.

Gustavo Varela (£1.5m), Marouane Fellaini (£27.5m), Juan Mata (£37.1m), Luke Shaw (£30m), Ander Herrera (£29m), Marcos Rojo (£16m) and Angel di Maria (£60m) have all arrived, but there is still a lack of identity in this line-up.

The numbers count: United have lost 18 times post-Fergie compared to 10 in 2012/13

Money spent: United have spent almost £200m in three transfer windows, including Angel di Maria

Gustavo Varela, £1.5m

Marouane Fellaini, £27.5m

Juan Mata, £37.1m

Luke Shaw, £30m

Ander Herrera £29m

Marcos Rojo, £16m

Angel di Maria, £60m

Total £199.1m 

United have been craving an authoritative central midfielder for several years, while a dominant centre-back should have been the priority ahead of the 2014/15 season. Di Maria, while an outstanding talent, will not solve United's problems at the back.

Players such as Ander Herrera have been brought in to try and improve United's passing game, which suffered last season under Moyes. Their average possession is at 53.79, compared to 56.16 in 2012/13.

Meanwhile, it's not just the wins that have dried up but the goals too. In Fergie's final title-winning season United scored 114 goals from 54 games, compared to 96 with Moyes, Van Gaal and even Ryan Giggs at the helm.
