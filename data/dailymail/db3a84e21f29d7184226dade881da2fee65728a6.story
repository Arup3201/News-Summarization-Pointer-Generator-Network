For sale: Gold Coast's only five star beachfront resort developed by the late Australian businessman Christopher Skase for $170 million dollars, located just five minutes from Surfers Paradise and Sea World.

The Australian owners have listed the iconic Sheraton Mirage Resort & Spa Gold Coast on the market globally after receiving several unsolicited off-market approaches.

Pearl Australasia's executive director David Higgins told Daily Mail Australia that the company had significant international and local buyer interests in the property.

'We've had a lot of interests recently and the hotel market has been internationally strong in the last 20 years so we thought it would be a good time to put the unique property on the market,' Mr Higgins said.

'The board took the strategic decision to publicly offer the property for sale in order to focus resources on the group’s Australian market-leading major diversified property business and the innovative MiiHome business that manufactures and delivers advanced permanent and re-locatable buildings globally.

'We have over 850 apartments at the moment and once the resort is sold, we're looking at using the money to develop more apartments in Brisbane, Gold Coast and Sydney.'

The five-star property have positioned as the leading resort hotel in Queensland and number one resort on the Gold Coast

The late Christopher Skase-developed resort was built on Four Mile Beach in 1987 for $100 million dollars but was brought from receivers to Raptis Group companies by Pearl Australasia for $62.5 million in 2009.

Director Higgins said the resort was only rated four-star when the company took over after Skase went bust in 1989.

'After the poor reputation, we have done everything we can to tick all the boxes, including great customer service, best location as well as a great tourism attraction,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

Since the $26 million dollars refurbishment of all 296 rooms and public places, including the Sheraton's singature lagoons and tropical gardens, bars, restaurants and pool, the five-star property have positioned as the leading resort hotel in Queensland and number one resort on the Gold Coast.

The company have appointed McVay Real Estate Australia and Knight Frank Gold Coast in a joint agency agreement.

McVay Real Estate Australia Chairman Dan McVay said the decision comes at a time of increased activity in the resort market sector.

'The Australian hotel investment market has experienced unprecedented levels of activity over recent years and this is set to continue with a record $2.5b in transactions expected this year,' Mr McVay said.

'We continue to experience very strong levels of interest from not only Asian investors, but an increase in appetite from Middle East and American groups looking to enter the market at a time when fundamentals are very positive.'

The resort will continue trading as normal, with the listing not having any effect on the management or operation of the resort.
