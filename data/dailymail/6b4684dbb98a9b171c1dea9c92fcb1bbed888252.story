Heartbreaking: Luke's temperature spiked and he suffered another huge bleed - close to a second litre - on April 6th and he went into cardiac arrest

A seven-year-old boy died in a short-staffed hospital ward on Good Friday because nurses were 'unconcerned' about a massive internal bleed following surgery, an inquest heard today.

Luke Jenkins, who was born with half a heart, went into hospital to have his third and final corrective operation at Bristol Children’s Hospital on March 30 2012.

But a report revealed that a series of errors - including staff being unaware where the resuscitation equipment was when he suffered cardiac arrest - contributed to his death.

Luke was expected to make a full recovery, but he lost almost two litres of blood following the operation.

He
 was moved out of intensive care and into a high dependency unit a day 
after the operation - despite his parent’s claim they were told he should 
remain there for three days.

His
 mother Faye Valentine and father Stephen Jenkins noticed that Luke 
suffered a huge bleed - around a litre - from a draining tube just three
 days after his operation, .

In
 a harrowing statement read in court, his father Stephen, 31, said: 'We called 
the nurse and asked her to look. She said it was ok, it was old blood.

'The
 nurses did not seem bothered by this and kept walking out of the room. 
Nurses were just looking at a monitor and writing things down on notes 
but not making any changes.

'Every time we had to ask nurses for pain relief because they were not checking.'

Mr
 Jenkins told the inquest nurses reset potentially vital alarms, which 
monitored Luke’s condition, to lower the trigger threshold.

He said: 'We were left for long periods of time before anyone would come and see what was going on.

'After an hour [of the alarm] the nurse came and put the bag [containing fluid] in the machine.

'I explained to her and she said it was disgusting and she was going to note it.'

Bleed: Luke was expected to make a full recovery, but he lost almost two litres of blood following the operation at Bristol Children's Hospital

Panic: His mother Faye Valentine and father Stephen Jenkins (left) noticed that Luke suffered a huge bleed - around a litre - from a draining tube just three days after his operation

Luke’s temperature spiked and he suffered another huge bleed - close to a second litre - on April 6th and he went into cardiac arrest.

But junior staff on the ward did not know where a vital piece of resuscitation equipment was kept.

Stephen, a student, has been unable to leave his home in Cardiff due to psychological problems following Luke’s death.

But his statement, read to the inquest in Flax Bourton, Bristol, told of the frantic efforts to save Luke’s life.

He said: 'We were left in the room holding the oxygen mask to his face. There didn’t seem to be any organisation of what was supposed to be done. Everyone seemed to panic.'

Harrowing: His mother Faye Valentine and father Stephen Jenkins gave harrowing statements to the court about their son's final hours. Stephen, a student, has been unable to leave his home in Cardiff due to psychological problems following Luke's death

Loved: Brain scans showed Luke had suffered serious damage and, with his family surrounding him for an emotional Christening service, Luke died on April 9 - just ten days after his surgery

Luke’s chest was opened in an effort to bring him back to life, but his heart stopped for more than 40 minutes.

Brain scans showed Luke had suffered serious damage and, with his family surrounding him for an emotional Christening service, Luke died on April 9 - just ten days after his surgery.

Getting better: Luke was born with a congenital heart defect and had already had two of the three corrective operations before he was taken to Bristol Children¿s Hospital for the third

A report, published shortly after Luke’s death, found that staff shortages were partly to blame for the tragedy.

The root cause analysis, put together by an investigative team at University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, said 'the workload and patient dependency is recognised as being significant' in Luke’s death.

When Luke collapsed on his ward, junior staff did not know where a vital piece of resuscitation equipment was kept.

The report said a risk assessment 
which had previously been carried out identified 'low and unsafe nurse 
staffing for a cardiac high dependency unit'.

Pathologist
 Liina Kiho, who performed the post mortem, recorded a cause of death of
 hypoxic ischemic brain injury, caused by post operative bleeding, due 
to a congenital heart defect, contributed to by a failure to thrive.

Luke
 was born with a congenital heart defect and had already had two of the 
three corrective operations before he was taken to Bristol Children’s 
Hospital for the third.

The 
court heard how Luke’s parents wanted Luke to be treated at BCH - despite 
concerns about previous treatment - because cardiologist Andrew Parry 
was to carry out the operation.

But
 on examining their son’s notes following his death, the family 
discovered a different doctor led the operation, with Dr Parry providing
 assistance because he would not be around for follow up checks due to a
 booked holiday.

Dr Parry 
told the inquest he did not believe the surgery caused the bleed - but 
could offer no clear answer as to how Luke came to lose so much blood.

He
 said: 'I am fastidious in my surgical technique and even if I had been 
even the slightest bit concerned about it I would have made sure it was 
perfect.'

After giving 
evidence, Dr Parry choked back tears while he apologised to Luke’s mother 
for apparently telling her he would be the lead surgeon.

He said: 'I’m sorry about the consult. It was never my intent.'

The inquest continues.
