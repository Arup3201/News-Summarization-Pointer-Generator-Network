Look away now if you like bananas, because the cost of your favourite snack is soaring.

High Street store giants Sainsbury's and Waitrose have increased the price of the popular fruit by 16 per cent, according to the latest research.

Trade magazine The Grocer reported that the retailers -- which sell only Fairtrade bananas -- have increased the price of a kilo of loose bananas from 68p to 79p.

Both Waitrose and Sainsbury's have increased the price of bananas to reflect rising market prices

Data from analysts Mintec showed that the UK wholesale price of bananas is up 12.5 per cent year on year to Â£900 a tonne. The analysts say that costs have been pushed up by lower production across many of the main producing countries and concerns over a fungal leaf disease that can reduce banana plant yield by up to 50per cent.

Co-op Bananalink said that shipping and labour costs had also increased adding that 79p was a more sustainable price for growers than 68p but still not a fair one.

Bananalink international co-ordinator Alistair Smith told the magazine that he thought it unlikely other big retailers would up their prices.

'We would like to see supermarkets permanently increase the price to what is fair and explain to consumers why this is a fair price for growers.'

The latest hike comes after Fairtrade Foundation warned in May that the UK supermarket price war was encouraging Fairtrade growers to turn their backs on British retail in favour of other markets.

Waitrose told The Grocer that the price hike was a reaction to increases in the market price of bananas. It stressed that it had long-term relationships with its growers, some going back more than 50 years.

Sainsbury's told the magazine that its price increase had been done 'without affecting any of our current supplier relationships.'

Data from pricing analysts BrandView.com showed that Asda, Tesco and Morrisons continue to sell 1kg of loose bananas for 68p.
