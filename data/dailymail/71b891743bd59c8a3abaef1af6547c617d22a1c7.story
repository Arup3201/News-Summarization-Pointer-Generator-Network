Christian monuments have been destroyed by the Chinese government in a move that will fuel fears of a state sponsored crackdown on the religion.

On Saturday, fifty officials blocked entry to Longgang Hill, in the city of Wenzhou - know as China's Jerusalem - a site of pilgrimage for the country's Christians. They used cranes to rip up statues and built walls around three others - depicting Jesus, the Virgin Mary and Saint Jospeh - which weigh up to five tonnes each.

There were no clashes with worshipers, as government workmen kept a promise not to damage the three bricked-off statues.

Four bulldozers started demolishing Sanjiang church in Wenzhou on Monday, after six weeks of protests

The torn up monuments are being stored at a church property in Hengdaiqiao, a Wenzhou suburb, but all other relgious decoration on the hilltop park was destroyed.

The authorities are claiming the construction of the park was illegal but Christians say this is just a pretext to justify their persecution.

Joseph, a Wnnzhou Catholic who declined to give his full name for security reasons, told UCA News: 'Even if the authorities determined that erecting religious articles on the site is against the law, they should allow us to appeal through legal means. This could help build the rule of law in society and stop corruption.'

Another anonymous witness to the destruction said: 'About 100 Catholics who came to watch the removals were blocked at the entrance. Some who managed to sneak in sang hymns and prayed while watching. Some could not hold back their tears.'

Two days later, bulldozers were sent in to demolish the city's Sanjiang Church, which was only completed last year at a cost of Â£2.84million.

The church's destruction is the end of a six-week-long struggle which had seen thousands of Christians camped outside the building in a bit to save it.

UCA News also reported that last week, state officals beat up four Christians who were trying to prevent the demolition of a four-storey building, owned by a Catholic laymen.

The authorities claimed that the building's top two floors had been built illegally and that it was being used as a site for underground worship.
