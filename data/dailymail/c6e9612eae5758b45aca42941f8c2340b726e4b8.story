Wayne Rooney showed his soft side ahead of England's training session in Portugal on Wednesday as the striker kissed his son Kai goodbye before joining his team-mates.

The Manchester United forward seemed in a relaxed mood and his spirits were certainly lifted when the youngster ran towards his dad for a loving embrace.

Rooney was quick to pick up Kai, who looked to be wearing a full England kit, and throw him lovingly above his head before training began with Roy Hodgson.

Rooney also enjoyed a chat with England captain Steven Gerrard on a grass verge with the rest of the team ahead of the session as they waited for their manager.

Hodgson and his 2014 World Cup squad are taking part in a warm weather training camp at the Vale Do Lobo Resort in Portugal ahead of the tournament in Brazil.

The players may have been shocked to realise that their warm weather training wasn't actually as warm as expected with the Portuguese climate currently very similar to England's.

It is just three weeks until Hodgson's side kick-off in Group D against Italy in the tricky conditions of Manaus, deep in the heart of the Amazon.

England are spending time in the Algarve and Miami in preparation for the expected hot and humid conditions, although their training camp in Portugal has not exactly gone to plan so far weather-wise.

The squad arrived in Vale do Lobo on Monday and, after torrential rain on Tuesday, were greeted by blustery conditions for their first and only open training session on Wednesday.
