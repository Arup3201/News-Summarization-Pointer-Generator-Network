People who have had chlamydia can be reinfected by their own guts, new research shows

If diagnosed with an STD, many people would be quick to point an accusatory finger at their partner.

But new research suggests they should perhaps think twice before making any assumptions about the source of their infection.

Scientists found some patients who have previously had chlamydia can be re-infected with the infection by their own guts.

This is because the antibiotics that are used to treat chlamydia sometimes fail to completely eradicate the disease.

The infection not only infects the reproductive organs, it also remains persistently – but benignly – in the gut.

It can remain here even after it has been eradicated from the genitals, researchers at the Arkansas Children’s Research Institute found.

And that reservoir is likely a source of the all-too-common reinfections that follow treatment, the researchers say.

The source of these re-infections has long been a mystery.

Some are blamed on continued intercourse with an infected partner. This is not surprising since chlamydia is usually asymptomatic in men.

However, this has not been able to explain all re-infections.

‘While all agree that chlamydiae may persist in a patient for long periods of time, and that recurrent infections do develop, there has been no agreement on how and where and in what form chlamydiae persist,’ said lead author Dr Roger Rank.

In the study, his co-author and Arkansas colleague Laxmi Yeruva showed in mice that antibiotics eradicated chlamydia from the genitals, but not from the gut.

Dr Rank showed further - also in mice
 - that chlamydial infection of the gut does not elicit an inflammatory 
response, and never resolves, unlike in the genital tract.

Antibiotics sometimes manage to eradicate chlamydia from the genitals but not from the gut where it remains benign but can cause reinfection

‘However,
 we found that [gut] infection does produce a strong immune response 
that can actually be effective against a genital infection, but that is 
unable to cure the [gut] infection,’ said Dr Rank.

Chlamydia is the most common cause of sexually transmitted disease in the world.

Young people  are worst affected, and 6.8 per cent of sexually active females aged 14 to 19 become infected annually.
