It barely measures half an inch long - but this tiny insect is capable of kicking up a stink.

The halyomorpha halys is headed for our shores, experts say, and if you are there when it arrives you will certainly know about it.

Known as the marmorated stink bug, it is named after the putrid stench it releases from its glands as a defence mechanism.

It has already created plague proportions in the US, has been spotted in Switzerland, France and Italy and biologists say it will ‘inevitably’ invade Britain.

Two bugs have already been intercepted on imported timber on Britain’s shores, and it is only a matter of time before more come into the country.

The brown marmorated stink bug, known for the stench it releases as a defence mechanism, will arrive in Britain in imported furniture, say experts

It is particularly pernicious because it invades homes when the first frosts appear each autumn.

The bugs, native to China, Japan and Taiwan, were accidentally introduced to the US in the mid-1990s.

They have since spread to 40 states and in 2010 ruined over £23 million worth of American apple crops alone.

The distinctive brown adult bug is shaped like a shield and resembles several species common in Britain. But the stench of rotten garbage it produices is unique.

Once mated, females lay up to 30 light green eggs on the underside of leaves that can hatch in three days.

Entemologist Max Barclay, of London’s Natural History Museum, said: ‘I think the brown marmorated stink bug will establish a population here. It is only a matter of time.

‘It will make its presence felt fairly quickly because it comes into people’s homes in the autumn and winter.

‘Ancestrally, it used to hibernate in abandoned caves and houses are the next best thing.

‘They are a nuisance and people won’t like brown stink bugs in their homes. In hotels in southern American states you have signs warning about stink bugs in rooms because that is the way it is.

‘It is very hard to get rid of them because they lay eggs and even if you get the exterminators in to vacuum them up, they come back the following year.

The Government’s Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera) is warning people to check imported plants and containers for any sign of the pest.

Fera’s senior entomologist Chris Malumphy said that the bug could well become a public nuisance in the UK.

In the US, the brown marmorated stink bug has been detected in 41 states as well as two Canadian provinces, posing severe agricultural problems in six states and nuisance problems in fifteen others

Mr Malumphy told Horticulture Week magazine: ‘We have had a second interception on imported timber, so the bug has been found twice in the UK.

‘We have done a risk assessment. There is evidence the bug would be able to establish in the south of England.

‘In North America, it reaches plague proportions and there are records of hundreds or even a thousand in people’s houses.

‘I don’t expect plague proportions here but they make an evil, repellent odour to ward off predators, so a large number of bugs coming into your house is a rather compelling public nuisance.’

The bug usually produces up to five generations per year in warmer climates but only one or two in cooler climates.

Mr Malumphy said: ‘Later generations cause the most economic damage. The UK climate means the bug wouldn’t have a significant economic impact on agriculture or horticulture like in North America.’

Dr Sam Jones, technical manager of pest management firm International Pheromone Systems, said: ‘The bug is going to get here at some point soon.

‘It is already in France and Germany and they could hop into crates of goods or timber or plants being transported. And since it hibernates in buildings over the winter, once it is here there is a good chance that it will be a problematic pest.

‘These are bigger than ladybirds and when you try and disturb them or hoover them they produce a really foul smell.

‘Researchers are trying to identify the chemical the stink bugs release to attract others, so that they can then be lured into pheromone traps.’
