The family of an unarmed Mexican man who was shot dead by police has hired the lawyer representing the families of Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin.

Relatives of Antonio Zambrano-Montes have called on the services of Benjamin Crump, a civil rights attorney, saying they want justice after he was killed while running away from officers earlier this month in Pasco, Washington state.

The death has sparked two weeks of protests in the city along the Columbia River in the south eastern part of the state after video emerged showing the moment he was shot.

Yesterday, Mr Crump revealed that Mr Zambrano-Montes' mother, Agaptia Montes-Rivera fainted when he accompanied her to see her son's body.

She told reporters through an interpreter, before entering the funeral home: 'I want people to understand my pain.

'It's really hard... When I saw the video, I felt really bad. That's why I asked for justice.'

Authorities say Mr Zambrano-Montes, a 35-year-old Mexican immigrant and former orchard worker, was throwing rocks at officers and a stun gun failed to subdue him.

The Franklin County coroner has ordered an inquest into the death, which is being reviewed by a regional task force and the investigation is being monitored by federal authorities.

In a video recording by Dario Infante Zuniga, five 'pops' are audible and Mr Zambrano-Montes can be seen running away, pursued by three officers.

The orchard worker, who was born in Mexico, had allegedly been throwing rocks at police. He is pictured turning to face three armed officers as one holds up a flashlight and two others draw their guns

As the officers draw closer, he turns to face them and more 'pops' are heard before he falls to the ground.

The killing was the fourth by Pasco police in less than a year. Officers were exonerated after similar investigations in the first three cases.

Mr Crump says that Mr Zambrano-Montes spoke no English and was an immigrant living in the country illegally.

He added: 'Zambrano-Montes had his hands up. Why did you have to shoot him?

'All the young people are protesting that Antonio had his hands up based on what they saw in the video, and he had no weapons.

'And just like in New York, it shows the graphic last moments of Eric Garner's life, here you have a video that shows the graphic last moments of Antonio's life.'

But police said officers felt threatened and that Mr Zambrano-Montes was arrested last year for assault after throwing objects at Pasco officers and trying to grab an officer's pistol, court records show.

The death has sparked two weeks of protests in the city along the Columbia River in the south eastern part of the state

Authorities have said he was not armed with a gun or knife when he was killed and whether he had a rock in his hand when he was shot is still under investigation.

Two of the officers involved were white, and the other Hispanic. All three opened fire, though the number of shots has not been disclosed.

Last week, investigators asked for patience as the investigation continues.

Meanwhile, another attorney who says he's representing Zambrano-Montes' family says he wants to temporarily withdraw a $25 million claim filed his widow and two daughters against the city after the shooting.

Attorney Charles Herrmann of Tacoma said yesterday that the claim was premature.
