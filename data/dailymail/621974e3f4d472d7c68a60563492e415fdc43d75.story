Apology: Jeremy Clarkson at Heathrow on Thursday following the outcry over his comments

Jeremy Clarkson was forced to apologise last night after a joke he made about executing public sector workers for going on strike triggered a political row and thousands of complaints. 

The outspoken TV presenter faced a storm of protest after saying public sector strikers should be ‘executed’ in front of their families.

In a day of extraordinary overreaction to what was clearly meant as a joke, one union official threatened to report him to police, while another said his comments were worthy of Colonel Gaddafi.

Even the Prime Minister, a friend of Mr Clarkson, was dragged into the row, describing the remarks as ‘silly’, while Ed Miliband said they were ‘disgusting’.

By yesterday evening, when Mr Clarkson was finally forced to issue an apology, the BBC had received almost 5,000 complaints about the interview on Wednesday night’s edition of The One Show.

The row erupted after millions saw the Top Gear host asked for his views on the day’s nationwide strikes.

He started by saying he liked the strikers, because the industrial action had meant there was no traffic on the roads.

But after insisting he had to be balanced as he worked for the impartial BBC, he launched into a satirical rant.

He said: ‘Frankly, I would have them shot. I would have them taken outside and executed in front of their families.’

Later in the show, he also complained about people who commit suicide by throwing themselves on railway lines, saying trains should not stop for them.

Fury: Union boss Dave Prentis has said Jeremy Clarkson, pictured at Heathrow, should be sacked from the BBC

Yesterday, the Prime Minister, whose 
‘Chipping Norton Set’ of friends includes Mr Clarkson, former News of 
the World and Sun editor Rebekah Brooks and PR man Matthew Freud, was 
forced to disassociate himself from the comments. 

Asked about them on ITV’s This Morning show, Mr Cameron said it was ‘a silly thing to say – I’m sure he didn’t mean it’.  

Labour leader Mr Miliband said the 
remark was ‘absolutely disgraceful and disgusting’, adding: ‘He 
obviously does not understand the lives of the people who were going out
 on strike yesterday.’

The unions exploded in fury, with 
Unison calling on the BBC to sack the presenter and even contacting 
lawyers to consider whether he could be reported to the police for 
inciting violence.

Dave Prentis, Unison’s general 
secretary, said: ‘The One Show is broadcast at a time when children are 
watching: they could have been scared and upset by his aggressive 
statements.

‘While he is driving round in fast 
cars for a living, public sector workers are busy holding our society 
together: they save others’ lives on a daily basis, they care for the 
sick, the vulnerable, the elderly. 

‘They wipe bottoms, noses, they help 
children to learn, and empty bins – they deserve all our thanks – 
certainly not the unbelievable level of abuse he threw at them.’

The union’s health spokesman Karen Jennings went so far as describing the comments as ‘almost like Gaddafi’. 

Thousands of public sector workers joined pickets and marches across the country on Wednesday in a strike over pensions and cuts

Bob Crow, leader of the RMT union, 
said Mr Clarkson was a ‘man who bleeds a fortune out of the 
licence-payer for poncing around the world driving luxury cars’. 

‘Clarkson’s incitement to violence, 
and the refusal of David Cameron to roundly condemn it, is grossly 
offensive to all public sector workers but even more so to our members 
on the Royal Fleet Auxiliary who were on strike on Wednesday and who 
risk their lives in trouble spots around the world servicing the Naval 
fleet,’ he said.

Bert Schouwenburg, of the GMB union, said: ‘Jeremy Clarkson’s vile and offensive comments are insensitive in the extreme.

Jeremy Clarkson's remarks about wanting to shoot strikers are the latest in a long line of controversial comments that are likely to add to his ever-increasing list of enemies.

In February 2009, he famously called then Prime Minister Gordon Brown a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot' and in November the previous year, the BBC received almost 2,000 complaints when he joked about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes.

More recently, in October, it emerged he had taken out an injunction to prevent allegations about his private life being published.

Back in September 2005, he had a custard pie thrown in his face by green campaigners after picking up an honorary degree at Oxford Brookes University.

Also that year, he offered some 'handy hints' to cyclists, saying: 'Do not cruise through red lights. Because if I'm coming the other way, I will run you down, for fun.'

In November 2004, conservationists accused him of ruining virgin hillside during an off-road test of a Land Rover for the motoring programme.

And in February 2004, the BBC paid £250 compensation to Churchill Parish Council in Somerset after Clarkson drove a 4x4 Toyota pick-up truck into a 30-year-old horse chestnut tree to test the vehicle's strength.

‘GMB works with trade unions 
representing employees on banana and pineapple plantations in Latin 
America where activists have met exactly the fate that Mr Clarkson 
describes.’

By 5pm yesterday, the presenter had issued an apology.

When Mr Clarkson was asked for his 
reaction before flying out of the country, he said: ‘See what I actually
 said and then judge.

'I didn’t for a moment intend these remarks to be 
taken seriously – as I believe is clear if they’re seen in context.

'If 
the BBC and I have caused any offence, I’m quite happy to apologise for 
it alongside them.’

The BBC said: ‘The One Show is a live topical 
programme which often reflects the day’s talking points. Usually we get 
it right, but on this occasion we feel the item wasn’t perfectly judged.

'The BBC and Jeremy would like to apologise for any offence caused.’

Last night Tory MP Douglas Carswell called for a sense of perspective.

‘We shouldn’t rise to the bait on this,’ he said. ‘This is politicians causing mischief.’

Clarkson’s comments have regularly landed him in hot water.

Earlier this year, an item on Top Gear led to a complaint from the Mexican ambassador over ‘vulgar’ insults about Mexicans.

He called the then prime minister 
Gordon Brown a ‘one-eyed Scottish idiot’ and triggered 2,000 complaints 
when he joked about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes.
