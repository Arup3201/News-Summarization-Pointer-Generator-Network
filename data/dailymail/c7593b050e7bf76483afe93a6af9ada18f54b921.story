Alan Pardew believes English football is not doing enough to include black coaches – and wants to see more ethnic minorities in top jobs in the Barclays Premier League.

Pardew’s Crystal Palace side face Queens Park Rangers at Selhurst Park in Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off, and the visitors have the top flight’s only black manager in Chris Ramsey.

QPR appointed Ramsey last month unexpectedly after Harry Redknapp left the club, and Pardew believes the appointment was a great boost for the Premier League.

‘He’s black, which I think is great for the Premier League,’ Pardew said. 'We’ve got a black manager, and it’s something that I want to promote here in terms of our coaches, because the percentage of players we have to percentage of coaches in terms of origin isn’t right.

‘So I’m pleased (he got the role), I hope he does well, he’s done a terrific job so far because that QPR team has improved under his tutorage, though hopefully not improved too much tomorrow otherwise we’re going to be in trouble.’

And Pardew said he feels the entire English game needs to work on being more inclusive in the people it hires.

Ramsey is one of just six black or ethnic minorities bosses in the Football League, along with Huddersfield Town boss Chris Powell, Brighton’s Chris Hughton, Carlisle manager Keith Curle, Leyton Orient boss Fabio Liverani and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink with Burton Albion.

‘I think it’s just important to promote coaches. The proportion of African, Afro-Caribbean players to coaches is not right,’ Pardew said.

‘I think it’s something that needs to be spoken about and something that we need to work on as an FA and the chairmen up and down the country need to give more chances.’

‘I actually do feel that a lot of black players or Afro-Caribbean players don’t go into the coaching courses. Perhaps they feel it’s not going to help them, but it will.

‘We need a greater influx of Indians, Afro-Caribbeans, entering our coaching system and getting jobs, so the proportion makes sense.’
