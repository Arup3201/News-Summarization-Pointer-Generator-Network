More than 1,400 flood defence projects to protect vulnerable homes will be given the green light today.

The Treasury will set out details of the schemes set to benefit from £2.3billion in investment following the mass flooding that hit many areas last winter.

It means around 300,000 more homes will be protected.

The National Audit Office warned recently that half of the UK’s flood defences are running at ‘minimal level’ and likely to give way if there is heavy rain again this year.

Ministers will today commit to spending £15.5million on flood defences in Somerset over the next six years, which they hope will benefit 7,000 properties. It includes £4.2million to be spent on the Somerset Levels which were worst affected by flooding last winter, the wettest since records began in 1910.

There will also be major investment in areas such as the Humber Estuary, where £80million will be spent, and £196million for a programme in the Thames Estuary.

Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: ‘We all saw the destruction and heartache caused by flooding last year and that is why this investment is vital to build up Britain’s defences for the future.

‘The projects we are announcing today will protect some of the country’s most at-risk locations, ensuring that we will be as prepared as possible for future severe weather.’

Officials claim the six-year programme would help prevent more than £30billion of economic damage.

Other flood defence projects will include schemes at Tonbridge, Yalding and surrounding communities in Kent – which will receive more than £17million – £73million for the Boston barrier in Lincolnshire, £42million for a scheme in Oxford and £47million for coastal defence improvements for Rossall, Lancashire.

Friends of the Earth said leaked documents suggested there was still a half-a-billion-pound shortfall in the budget for flood defences over the next parliament.

The environmental charity’s climate campaigner Guy Shrubsole said: ‘A year after Britain’s wettest winter ever, the Chancellor’s leaked flood defence plans simply don’t hold water.

‘Faced with rising sea levels, the Government needs to be investing far more in flood defences to protect households and prevent climate change from the outset.

‘But these leaked plans show that Mr Osborne isn’t taking the threat of climate change seriously: having foolishly neglected defences over the last Parliament, he’s proposing to do the same over the next one.The Chancellor must use his Autumn Statement to invest enough in flood defences to keep pace with global warming, and redouble efforts to wean the economy off flood-inducing fossil fuels.’

Shadow environment secretary Maria Eagle said: ‘Communities at risk of flooding won’t buy Government spin on what is simply a re-announcement of capital funding confirmed a year ago.

‘This is not new money – at the beginning of this parliament David Cameron cut the flood protection budget by over a £100million a year. As a result we are playing catch-up on flood defences.

'The Committee on Climate on Change has already said that the Government’s plans could leave 80,000 additional properties at serious risk of flooding.’

Other announcements in today’s ‘national infrastructure plan’ will include new housing developments, and talks with a company bidding to build the world’s first tidal lagoon energy plant in Swansea Bay.

The developers of the £800million project have said their application is the first step to developing technology that could meet 10 per cent of the UK’s electricity needs from the tides.

If it goes ahead, the scheme would involve a six-mile wall built around Swansea Bay, creating a lagoon in the Severn Estuary with turbines that can harness the incoming and outgoing tides to generate power 14 hours a day.

The scheme would provide renewable power for 120,000 homes for 120 years, saving 236,000 tonnes of carbon a year and creating 1,850 construction jobs as well as 150 long-term jobs in operation and leisure facilities on the lagoon.

Other projects being announced include a deal with Toshiba, GDF Suez and NuGen to provide a guarantee to assist the financing of a new nuclear power plant at Moorside, near Sellafield in Cumbria.

Up to £50million will be available to support innovation in manufacturing ultra-low emission vehicles.

It has also been confirmed that £15billion of new roads are to be built in the biggest road-building programme for half a century.
