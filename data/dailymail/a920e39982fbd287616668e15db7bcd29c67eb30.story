Police have released security camera footage showing the thief who robbed former Mrs. Texas United America of nearly $1 million in jewelry, bags, and valuables from her luxurious 'she cave'.

Theresa Roemer said she and her husband were only gone 90 minutes for dinner at a country club just two blocks away, but they came home to broken glass and empty shelves. The robbery bears all the markings of being perpetrated by a professional thief.

In the video footage, released on Tuesday, the burglar is seen wearing a light-colored, hooded jump suit with a baseball cap which helps him blend into the background as he expertly picks through items in Roemer's astonishing three-story, 3,000-square-foot closet.

Surveillance footage recorded a small man dressed entirely in white and wearing gloves in the house, taking four trips to move all the goods outside

Deputies have determined that the intruder forced his way into the Roemers' home through a bathroom window.

Surveillance footage recorded a small 
man dressed entirely in white and wearing gloves in the house, taking 
four trips to move all the goods outside.

The burglary occurred between 7 p.m. and 
11 p.m. on Friday and the suspect spent almost an hour inside, relaying 
items back outside.

Police have released the video in an attempt to generate leads about the theft, which happened less than two weeks after Roemer's closset had been featured on Good Morning America.

Roemer told the Houston Chronicle that the video was shot with an infrared camera, because the intruder worked in the dark and never turned on the light.

'That's why it is so unclear and we can't tell the exact color of his clothing,' she said.

Roemer has admitted that she and her husband failed to turn on their home's security system before heading out to dinner on Friday night. She also didn't lock the glass door to her prized 'she-cave'.

'I don't think anybody can go through life without doing something careless when they're flustered and hurried before leaving,' she told the Chronicle.

'But now I lock all my doors and have lights on, inside and out. The alarm is set, and I'm having more lights and cameras installed.'

Roemer said that because she was only away from her home a short while she did not arm the security system

Roemer said she and her husband were only away for 90 minutes to eat dinner at a nearby country club

Roemer said she used the space to host charity events and that it took her a whole 45 minutes to get ready

'They took everything,' Roemer said. 'They took all my jewelry, all 
my watch collections, my husband’s watch collections, my Birkin 
collection. They literally walked out with between $800,000 and a 
million dollars’ worth of stuff.'

The most expensive items taken included 10 Rolex watches, up to a dozen Chanel watches, Cartier watches, and other expensive baubles and accessories. 

'I feel violated… raped,' she said. 'To watch someone on film 
take everything out of your house that means much to you – it’s just 
wrong.'

She may have been targeted due to the recent media attention on her  3,000sq ft closet, called her 'she-cave.'

Theresa
 Roemer, a former Miss Texas United America, enlisted designer Thom 
Anderson to add the luxurious three-story space to her Woodlands, Texas,
 home, which houses her handbags, shoes and other accoutrements. It cost
 roughly $500,000 to build.

'It
 started years ago when I had a closet party and all the girls came over
 and they said, "I just wish it was bigger,"' she told the Houston Chronicle, adding: 'Since then it's just been getting bigger and bigger and bigger, it's like a ''she cave.''

It appears the thief gained entrance by using a glass cutter to get into the bathroom

'The
 third floor houses all my furs and big hats, you come down the spiral 
staircase to the second floor which is where I get my hair and make up 
done, it also houses all the shoes from Louis Vuitton and Gucci, to my tennis and work out gear,' she said.

'Then

 you come down a floating staircase, which is just magical, and the 
first floor is where you pick out your jewelry and bags,' she continued,
 noting that it typically takes her 45 minutes to get ready.

In fact, the closet even features a champagne bar - perfect for hosting events to benefit charitable causes.

'Yes, it’s full of amazing things,' Mrs Roemer she had told Houston’s KHOU, 'but this closet was built and intended for fundraising.'

Roemer
 has used the hot-ticket space to raise money for causes such as the 
American Heart Foundation and Texas Children's Hospital.

But it also serves the style needs of those close to Mrs Roemer.

The thief target high-end items like Rolex and Cartier watches

'My daughter always says that she doesn’t need to go to the store; she can just shop my closet!' she told Neiman Marcus's blog.

'And of course I do let a few, very special friends borrow my Birkin bags.'

Upon learning her sanctum had been violated, she tried to put things in some perspective.

June was the seventh anniversary of her son's death in a car accident. 

'I need to count my blessings that no one was hurt or killed,' Roemer said. 'I’ve been through amazingly hard things in life, like burying
 my son, and this is not anything compared to that.'
