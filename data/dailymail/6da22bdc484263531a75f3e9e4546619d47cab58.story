A New York woman is suing a hospital and two doctors, claiming she was forced to undergo a cesarean section against her will.

Rinat Dray was a 32-year-old mother of two boys who had been delivered via cesarean section.

She decided that with her third pregnancy, she wanted to have a VBAC, or vaginal birth after cesarean.

However, when she arrived at Staten Island University Hospital in labor, Dr Dr Leonid Gorelik began pressuring her to have another cesarean section, she said this week.

Dray's attorney Michael Bast told RH Reality Check that after Dray had been in labor for several hours the attending physician would not examine her unless she agreed to have the surgery.

Gorelik told her that she was putting her baby at risk and that her uterus would rupture if she didn't have the surgery, Dray told The New York Times. The doctor also said that not having the surgery was tantamount to child abuse, and that her baby would be taken away from her if she refused, Dray said.

Hospital records show that the cesarean section was approved by the hospital's legal department and Dr James J Ducey, the director of maternal and fetal medicine.

'The woman has decisional capacity. I have decided to override her refusal to have a c-section,' he wrote in her case notes.

Bast, a specialist in medical malpractice, said that this is the first case in which he has seen a woman's refusal to have a cesarean section overruled.

Generally, he said, women who are reluctant to have cesarean sections are eventually talked into have the procedure.

According to Dray's complaint, not only did the hospital ignore her express wishes not to have the surgery, but they also failed to consult the bioethics department and didn't engage the hospital's patient advocate, reports RH Reality Check.

Dray, having already undergone two C-sections, was reluctant to endure a third, due to the after-effects of the surgery.

She did her research and believed she may be a successful VBAC candidate.

Dray raised the issue with physicians in the Metropolitan OB-GYN Associates group and they indicated a vaginal birth was a possibility for her.

New guidelines set out by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists state that VBAC is a safe option for most women, including those who have had multiple previous cesareans.

ACOG states that respect for the patient's decision-making requires that a cesarean birth cannot be forced nor can care be denied if a woman refuses a cesarean during labor.

The guidelines also note that a VBAC means the patient avoids serious abdominal surgery, lowers a woman's risk of hemorrhage and infection and can shorten post-partem recovery time.

During the surgery to which Dray never agreed, the doctor perforated her bladder.

No comment: The hospital cannot address the legal issue, but a spokesman says it has a good record of both cesareans and VBAC (vaginal birth after cesarean)

Dr Gorelik, in court papers, denied that he had carried out the surgery against Dray's will.

He said that her own 'culpable conduct and want of care' were to blame for any injuries she sustained.

According to the Centers for Disease COntrol and Prevention, almost 33 per cent of births are by cesarean section, a rate that has been climbing since 1996 for various reasons, including a desire by mothers and doctors to schedule deliveries and fear of malpractice lawsuits should the baby be injured during a normal delivery.

The New York Times reports that the hospital has defended its actions, saying that its 22 per cent cesarean section rate is much lower than the state average of 34 per cent, and that as of 2012, its VBAC rate was at 29 per cent compared to a state average of 11 per cent.

Court documents state that Dr Ducey claims Dray's baby was 'at risk for serious harm without the C-section.'

Dray, now 35, says she begged Gorelik to give her more time to give birth to her child naturally.

As she lay on the operating table, he told her, 'Don't speak,' reports The New York Times.Â 

Dray is suing the doctors and the hospital for malpractice, alleging they 'improperly substituted their judgement for that of the mother' and 'pressuring and threatening' her during the birth of her youngest son, Yosef, who was born in July 2011.
