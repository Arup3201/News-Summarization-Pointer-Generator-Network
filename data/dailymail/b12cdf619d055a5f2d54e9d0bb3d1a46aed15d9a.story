To look at little Ruby Hodgson's bright smile you would never think that just four weeks ago her life was hanging in the balance.

The three year old, from Redcar, in North Yorkshire, has been battling a brain tumour which, at one stage, stretched from ear to ear.

Then, just one month ago, when it seemed she’d beaten the tumour, 
she was so badly hit by stomach bug C.difficile, it looked like she may 
not even be around to celebrate her October 8 birthday she shares with her dad 
Wayne.

Brave smile: Three year old Ruby Hodgson, from Redcar, Cleveland, who has battled back from the brink of death twice

Devastated parents Wayne and Sally could only look on helplessly as doctors at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary (RVI) battled to save their little girl.

Ruby’s latest problems began when, 
after completing 25 of her 28 chemotherapy doses, she contracted, as a 
side effect, mucositis - a painful inflammation of the digestive tract.

Encouraged by her progress, her consultant decided to stop the chemotherapy to spare her further pain.

Sally recalls: 'We were on a high. We just felt so relieved that "yes, that looks like the end of the cancer."'

But the very next day, Ruby’s temperature rose, so it was back up to the RVI again.

And very quickly, things took a dramatic turn for the worse.

With her immune system low, the C.difficile - a usually harmless stomach bacteria - had turned life-threatening.Sally told the Gazette Live: 'Basically, all the good bacteria had been wiped out by the bad.'Anyone we asked said it was severe - and we knew severe cases often didn’t make it.'Ruby suffered a prolapse, her lung collapsed and her little body swelled up massively because it was retaining fluid.

C. diff produces poisons which cause diarrhoea, and in the worst cases, a potentially fatal infection of the abdomen.

Medics quickly fitted a catheter and
put the little girl on morphine, paracetemol and ketamine, but the 
toddler was still screaming and rolling in pain.

Father Wayne said: 'You couldn’t fit another person into the room - every consultant and doctor was in there.'

Sally said: 'When I heard my mum on the phone to my dad crying, saying he’d better get himself up, that’s when it hit home.'

According to the family even the nurses looking after Ruby struggled to contain the tears.

She was placed in intensive care and on a ventilator, where she was sedated for several days 'so her tummy could go to sleep'.

Play time: Ruby will not let her condition get in the way of her fun

Doctors administered, for the first time, two types of drugs intravenously, in a move which will benefit other children in the future. 

It worked and before long, Ruby was out of danger. Even then the drama was not over. 

Condensation in her feeding tube dripped into her lung, prompting another emergency response.

Yet after a four-week hospital stay, just a few days later Ruby was ready to return home to be reunited with brother Daniel, 17, and Emily, 13, and play again with her favourite loved Disney characters.

All end of treatment tests have shown no sign of Ruby’s tumour returning. She’s also back on a normal diet.

Her grateful parents now want to spread the word about Crawford House - the Sick Children’s Trust accommodation which meant they could stay with Ruby in Newcastle during her treatment - and the need to give blood, with Ruby receiving more than 30 pints.
