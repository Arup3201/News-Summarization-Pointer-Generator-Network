Manchester United legend Gary Neville has slammed their performance against Everton as 'toothless' following their 3-0 defeat on Sunday.

Goals from James McCarthy, John Stones and Kevin Mirallas condemned United to their third successive Premier League loss at Goodison Park as well putting their hopes of a top-four finish at risk.

After the match, Red Devils manager Louis van Gaal accused his players of lacking desire.

Van Gaal admitted he was worried after watching United go through their pre-match warm-up - and those fears were shared by his assistants, Ryan Giggs and Albert Stuivenberg.

And speaking on his podcast, Neville concurs with Van Gaal's assessment - adding that it was the Old Trafford outfit's worst performance in the last five or six weeks.

'It was a strange game, and you would have thought that both teams had nothing to play for in some ways,' the 40-year-old said in The Gary Neville Podcast.

'United were toothless, and that is being kind. I didn't really see them try and dribble past a player, make any forward runs.

Ashley Young, pictured battling Aaron Lennon, had been in fine form for United - like many of his team-mates - but Neville branded the Red Devils' display against Everton as their worst for five or six weeks

'At times they were not getting enough men in the box and the final pass was poor. It is the worst I have seen United play for five or six weeks.

'They have been playing so well. Even in defeat at Stamford Bridge last week they played really well.

'Today [Sunday] it wasn't there. It was Everton who had the cutting edge. It was through [Aaron] Lennon, [Romelu] Lukaku and Mirallas when he came on who looked the ones most dangerous to break through either defence.
