Vogue has broken the terms of its own health initiatives again, this time by publishing a fashion spread in Vogue Mexico’s November issue that features a 15-year-old model.

Young Polish model Julie Borawska stars in the shoot looking every bit the Vogue model in the story’s mostly-blue clothes – but she does not fit the magazine’s self-imposed rule of using faces that are older than 16.

Julie’s feature represents the third time that Vogue’s international editions have broken their health initiative by using young models.

Too young: Julia Borawski (pictured on the cover of Barrel Fashion), is a 15-year-old Polish model who appeared in Vogue Mexico, despite the magazine's guideline not to use models under the age of 16

The Vogue Health Initiative was established in 2012 to emulate similar guidelines that were being implemented across the global fashion industry – from Israel to the United States.

But two months later, in Vogue China’s August 2012 issue, 15-year-old model Ondria Hardin appeared in a fashion spread.

The following month, another 15-year-old, Sarah Kees, appeared in Vogue Italia’s September issue.

A fourth violation almost occurred around the same time when 14-year-old Thairine Garcia was photographed for Vogue Japan. Her shoot, however, was never published.

Regarding Borawska’s feature, Vogue 
Mexico’s editor Kelly Talamas says that the magazine bought her spread 
as syndicated content and that it was unaware of the model’s real age.

She
 told Fashionista that the publication ‘did not cast any models for this
 shoot, and was not involved in any manner with the production.’

Syndicated content: Vogue Mexico's editor says that the magazine was not involved in the production of Borawski's shoot and that her photographs were purchased as syndicated content

Representatives for Vogue Mexico have since contacted the shoot’s photographer Kevin Sinclair ‘to clarify this issue and identify exactly where the protocol failed in order to avoid this from ever happening again.’

But as Mr Sinclair told the site: ‘I am aware of the age restrictions with Condé Nast. I was not aware the model was 15 years of age. When we communicated with her agency in Poland they never mentioned that she was so young. We were all under the impression that she was 18 years or older, not 15.’

Representatives for Julie's Polish agency Gaga Models told MailOnline that they took care to make Mr Sinclair aware of her age before she was hired.

Julie’s birth year (1998) is clearly labeled on the agency’s website. Her Instagram bio also confirms her age, reading: ’15 yo polish model...[sic]’

At the time of Ondria Hardin’s feature in Vogue China, Condé
 Nast International’s chairman and chief executive Jonathan Newhouse 
said that the company was ‘very serious’ about its health initiative and
 that it would do ‘everything possible to prevent future errors.’

Vogue Mexico's oversight does not correlate with his comments.
