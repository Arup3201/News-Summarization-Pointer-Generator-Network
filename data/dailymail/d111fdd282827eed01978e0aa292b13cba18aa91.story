Roy Keane has never been to one shy away from sharing his opinion and the Republic of Ireland assistant spoke to the media on Sunday.

Discussing Ireland's chances, the country's Everton contingent and Aston Villa youngster Jack Grealish, here's what the former Manchester United and Celtic midfielder had to say... 

On taking care when leaving the team hotel...

‘We go into Malahide and have a coffee, it’s fine. We were out last night for a meal, it was fine. We’re not One Direction.

On Jack Grealish making up his mind about Ireland...

‘I don’t ask him anymore. We could be waiting a bloody long while, knowing his Dad.’

On where Ireland stand now in Euro 2016 qualifiers...

‘We have to now try to get maximum points in every home match. It’s important the players step up to the plate.’

On Robbie Keane’s comment that he’s no ‘f***** Niall Quinn’...

‘He’s a lot better than Niall Quinn. Robbie is brilliant for the group and brilliant for the team. He’s as good a professional as I’ve come across.’

Keane believes his namesake Robbie, the striker, is a better player than former Ireland frontman Niall Quinn

On fitness issues for Coleman and McCarthy...

‘You always get the impression from Everton that Seamus and James are both barely able to walk. When they actually turn up and they are walking through the reception, “Praise the Lord, it’s a miracle”.'

On attitude of Everton manager Martinez to Ireland...

‘I don’t think he ever played at senior international level and maybe doesn’t appreciate how big it is for us and how big the games are for us.’

Roy Keane is concerned that Everton are putting pressure on players to pull out of international duty
