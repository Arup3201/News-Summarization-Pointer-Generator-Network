Leo Santa Cruz fired an Exocet of a warning across the Atlantic to Carl Frampton and Scott Quigg with an explosive KO defence of his WBC world super-bantamweight title.

The California-based Mexican devastated his fellow countryman Manuel Roman with a crushing right less than a minute into the second round of this curtain-raiser for Mayweather-Maidana.

Santa Cruz is seeking championship unification fights with Frampton, who won the IBF belt in Belfast a week earlier, and Quigg, who retained his ‘regular’ WBA title inn Manchester earlier on this evening.

They will have watched with keen interest as Santa Cruz caught Roman with a short, crisp, dynamic right cross behind the ear. 

The challenger pitched head-first into the canvas at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, legs akimbo. 

Although he just about staggered upright he was lurching like a drunk in the Las Vegas night and the stoppage was inevitable.

The unbeaten Santa Cruz immediately called out Frampton and Guillermo Rigondeaux, the Cuban maestro who wears the WBO belt.

 He has already indicated a willingness to go to Ulster and England to fight Frampton or Quigg.
