Border guards battling the illegal trade in elephant tusks and rhino horns from Africa are making 600 seizures a year as gangsters try to smuggle ivory into the Far East.

Although the international trade in ivory was banned in 1989, customs officials are still seizing illegally imported ivory every week, including a 15kg haul discovered at Heathrow Airport.

The freight was being smuggled from Nigeria to China and Hong Kong, where there is a growing market for intricately carved ivory jewellery and decorations.

Seizure: Grant Miller of the UK Border Agency says his team seize 600 illegal shipments of elephant tusks and rhino horns every year

As a result the price of ivory has reached an incredible £2,000 per kilo.

When officials looked inside the shipment, labelled as 'handicraft samples', during a check on suspicious-looking crates, they discovered several hundred carved items, including bracelets and beads hidden inside.

An investigation by the Sunday People newspaper revealed how Border Force investigators are still facing a battle against ivory poachers, many of whom are supported by terrorist organisations.

Senior border force officer Grant Miller told the newspaper that his team were currently making around 600 seizures a year - most of which was ivory.

Prized: Powdered rhino horn can reach prices of £50,000 a kilo - making it more valuable than gold or cocaine

'There is no doubt about it that these are terrorist organisations who are slaughtering the animals to fund their activities, whether it be human trafficking or other things,' he said.

As many as 50,000 elephants were slaughtered for their ivory in 2011, the highest figure in 23 years.

Only two weeks ago 50 poachers on horseback, carrying rifles and machetes, brutally killed 89 African elephants including 33 pregnant females and 15 calves - leading to fears that there could be a further increase in smuggling cases.

The poachers attacked the herd in the central African country of Chad, with officials sadly confirming that the animal's tusks had been hacked off before they were killed.

Last year poachers killed 650 elephants at the Boubandjida National Park in Cameroon, butchering the surviving animals when they returned to mourn their dead.

When the sought-after ivory reaches China, where the domestic market is still legal, it is quickly purchased by buyers keen to exhibit their wealth.

Even museums and zoos in the UK have become fearful that poachers could strike because the trade in ivory and rhino horn, which is used in traditional Asian medicines and is prized as an aphrodisiac, is so lucrative.

Poaching gangs have been turning to 
Europe in their attempts to get the horns as rhinos in the wild have 
been hunted to the brink of extinction, with just 29,000 remaining.

The powdered horn can reach prices of £50,000 a kilo - making it more valuable than gold or cocaine.

At Port Lympne Wild Animal Park in Hythe and Howletts, near Canterbury, Kent, volunteers have been recruited to help protect the centre's 20 black rhinos by carrying out night patrols.

Park boss Bob O’Connor said: 'The police are taking it seriously enough to visit us, so we’ve got to take it seriously as well.'

In 2010 a man was jailed for two months after he attempted to smuggle the horn from a dead rhino at Colchester Zoo, Essex out of Manchester Airport to China.

And it is not just organised criminals who can fall foul of import laws, as Mr Miller told how his specialised team often were forced to confiscate hunting books and boots made from elephant skin from tourists.

Other recent finds include skulls, tiger bear and wolf skins and coral - all among the 30,000 animal and plant species listed as Endangered.

The team also discovered a rhino horn that would fetch £110,000, which has been placed under lock and key at a secret location. 

Demand for the prized horn has risen in Vietnam and China because it is wrongly seen as a miracle cure.

The International Fund for Animal Welfare has insisted that the UK must continue to battle the illegal trade.

'Flimsy punishment does not deter poachers – often the same people involved in drugs and arms dealing,' said director Robbie Marsland.
