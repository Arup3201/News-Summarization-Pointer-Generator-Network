Morrisons has promised to match the low prices of Aldi and Lidl, in a first for one of the ‘big four’ supermarkets.

The company aims to ‘neutralise’ the threat posed by budget rivals which have tempted millions with low prices and high quality.

Earlier this year Morrisons slashed the cost of essentials such as milk and bread to match the German discount chains.

Tesco's falling market share: Big increases by rivals Aldi and Lidl have hit the retailer badly

But the Yorkshire-based supermarket is now launching a loyalty card scheme that promises to match Aldi and Lidl prices.

The move is a radical response to the rise of the budget chains, which have eaten into sales at Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Asda and Morrisons.

More than £3billion has been wiped off Tesco’s share value following lost sales and the accusation executives cooked the books to minimise the resulting decline in profits.

This week Sainsbury’s admitted sales were down by 2.8 per cent over the past three months compared to a year ago.

Morrisons boss Dalton Philips has described the change in shopping habits triggered by the cost of living squeeze and rise of discount stores as the biggest on the High Street since the 1950s. Morrisons’ Match & More loyalty card keeps a record of purchases and compares prices with those charged at Aldi, Lidl, Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s.

Points are automatically added to a customer’s account at the till if their shopping would have been cheaper at a rival store.

Shoppers need to spend a minimum of £15 per visit. They will receive ten points for every 1p difference in the total cost. On amassing 5,000 points they will get a £5 voucher. Mr Philips said the move was designed to ‘neutralise’ the discount chains’ price advantage.

‘The discounters have been growing strongly but they only have one thing – price,’ he said.

‘We are saying we can guarantee price, but you also get ten times the range, big brands and our butchers, bakers and cheesemongers. I am confident this is a game changer for customers.’

Previously price comparisons have proved difficult because Aldi and Lidl stock many of their own brands.

Computer software is now able to compare the prices of Aldi and Lidl’s products with Morrisons’ own-label mid-range products.

The supermarket insists price match schemes currently available at Sainsbury’s and Tesco are too complicated and stop short of matching prices charged by the discounters.

Morrisons’ customer services director, Crawford Davidson, said: ‘Customers tell us that they like the idea of points-based supermarket cards. They like the idea of getting something back for shopping.

‘What they find frustrating is all the silly bits of paper they have to remember to get their price promise or price match. We are changing the game. We will be the first supermarket to price match Aldi and Lidl.’

Match & More launches in 11 stores today and will be rolled out across the chain by Christmas.
