A plane was forced to make an emergency landing after a passenger left their mobile phone charging in the toilet - triggering fears it was a bomb.

The U.S-bound Delta Air Lines flight diverted to Dublin yesterday due to a 'possible security situation' after the device was found plugged into a socket, the company said.

The Boeing 767-300, which was carrying 208 passengers from Istanbul, Turkey, was later cleared by Dublin Airport officials to continue its journey to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport.

Irish Aviation Authority spokeswoman Lilian Cassin said the plane touched down safely at around 4pm and was diverted to an isolated corner of the runway after the pilot requested an emergency landing.

Officers from Ireland's national police force, the Garda Siochana, boarded the plane, spoke to the pilot about the nature of the suspected bomb and asked any passenger missing their phone to come forward.

One came forward to say they had decided to charge the phone using the restroom's socket for shavers and left it there, wrapped up in its charging cord.

Another passenger using the restroom reported it might be a bomb.

Terror in the air: Fifteen passengers were injured when this Virgin Airbus A330 was forced to make an emergency landing at Gatwick after a fire on board

Passengers heading off to the sun from Dublin got rather more heat than had bargained for when they were left sweltering on a plane for over nine hours.

The torturous trip began when their Emirates flight was diverted to Ras Al-Khaimeh in the UAE after severe winds prevented it from landing in Dubai.

But the majority were not allowed to leave the jet because of immigration issues.

Instead they were left for hours with no water or air conditioning.One passenger fainted and another called it ‘hell’.

A source said that Irish horse trainer Aidan O’Brien was on the flight travelling to the Dubai World Cup.

Celia O’Connor Killeney, 55, from Galway, said: 'It was at least 38C. We were not able to leave our seats to stretch our legs which was very painful for me as I have arthritis.'

An Emirates spokesman admitted the plane was not equipped to deal with such a lengthy delay and would offer passengers on the March 30 flight air miles as compensation.

Police said nobody was hurt or arrested as a result of Monday's security alert, and the Dublin Airport Authority said no other flights were affected.

Delta spokesman Anthony Black said the aircraft had 208 passengers and 11 crew members.

He said the aircraft was refuelled before continuing its journey.

Just a few hours earlier, a packed Virgin Airbus A330 had to make an emergency landing at Gatwick Airport in England after a blaze on board.

Fifteen of the 299 passengers on the Florida-bound flight needed hospital treatment, many with suspected broken bones.

The plane turned back just 15 minutes into its flight to Orlando as smoke began to fill the cabin.

Some passengers accused the staff of panicking as the aircraft landed and its emergency chutes were deployed.

Passenger Tom Alridge said one of the cabin crew got into a flap after the  plane touched down.

‘She was screaming like a banshee – “Get off, get off” – she was literally pushing people down the chute,’ he said.

Scores of other flights in and out of the airport were suspended for nearly two hours, delaying thousands of passengers.

The closure was the second to hit Gatwick in three days.

On Friday, all outbound flights were briefly suspended after a hot air balloon drifted into the flight path.

A Malaysia Airlines flight to London has been forced to return to Kuala Lumpur today after one of its engines began experiencing trouble shortly after take-off.

The airline said the captain of the Boeing 747-400 plane carrying 351 passengers and 21 crew decided to turn back in the interest of passenger safety following a technical defect on one of the plane's four engines.

It said in a statement that the aircraft landed safely two hours later and was grounded upon arrival.

Passengers were put on another plane to London eight hours later.

A spokesman said the airline is still investigating the source of the problem.

The plane uses US-made Pratt & Whitney engines.
