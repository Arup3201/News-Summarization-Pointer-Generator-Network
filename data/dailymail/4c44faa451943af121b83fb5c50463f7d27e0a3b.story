A tenacious fish survived for nearly six hours without water after someone broke into a Massachusetts pet shop and smashed the 180-gallon reef tank that had been her home.

Big Blue, estimated to be about 18 years old, was found by the pet shop’s staff flopping on top of the rocks in the tank after the break in.

The rest of the fish that were in tank were dead.

‘She’s hanging on by a thread,’ Bob Schenck, the owner of Animal Instincts Aquarium & Pet Center in Fall River, Massachusetts, told the Herald News. ‘She might make it. It’s gonna take at least 7 to 10 days to see what the repercussions are, if she survives.’

Schenck, who has owned for 23 years, called the destructive act ‘totally malicious.’

He said the suspect entered the store by breaking through the glass on the front doors, ripped out the store’s computer system and broke a counter. 

Schneck said that the store’s security cameras recorded the suspect destroying the tank with a large pipe.

The unidentified man reportedly struck the large tank with the pipe several times until it finally cracked.  He then took out a piece of glass from the tank to make the water inside gush out faster, Schneck told the Herald News.

The suspect also broke a smaller 15-gallon tank and unsuccessfully tried to smash an additional 180-gallon tank that contained fresh-water fish.

He then snatched the store’s cash register and made off with merchandise, including reptile kits, Schneck said.

Over the years Animal Instincts has specialized in several kinds of exotic animals, including tarantulas, snakes, turtles, lizards, birds, rabbits, and both freshwater and saltwater fish.

Schenck said his business has been burglarized in the past but never to the point of his animals being killed.

Staff and friends spent the entire day Wednesday helping the owner clean up the mess before reopening the shop later in the evening.

Fall River police are investigating the break in.

For now Big Blue is resting safely in a new tank, a store employee told MailOnline.

‘She should be dead. It’s amazing she’s still kicking,’ Schenck told the Herald News.
