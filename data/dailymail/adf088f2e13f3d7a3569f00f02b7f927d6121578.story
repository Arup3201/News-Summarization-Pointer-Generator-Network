Police are hunting for two men who drove a U-Haul rental van through the front of an outdoor clothing store in San Francisco and made off with armfuls of pricey gear.

The smash-and-grab robbers backed into a Patagonia outlet near the Fisherman's Wharf complex around 3:30am on Monday.

Diego Munoz, an eye witness who lives next door, described it as a 'pretty brazen' stunt as the neighborhood is 'mostly families' and 'quiet at night'.

In need of repair: Police are hunting for two men who drove a U-Haul rental van through the front of this Patagonia clothing store in San Francisco and made off with armfuls of pricey gear

He added during an interview with KGO-TV: 'I only saw then grab a handful, an armful of stuff before they took off.'

Patagonia sells upscale outdoor and camping clothing and gear.

Its branded jackets range from $150 to $700. 

The robbers' van bulldozed down the glass front doors of the Patagonia boutique, damaging several windows and some display units.

The store was closed at the time and no one was hurt.

Staff are sifting through CCTV footage to see if it captured a clear image of the men.

The dollar value of the damage done and the merchandise taken wasn't immediately clear. 

Sergeant Fitz Wong said police spotted the van but lost track of it as it sped away.

They did, however, get part of the number plate reading 'AG135' and are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.
