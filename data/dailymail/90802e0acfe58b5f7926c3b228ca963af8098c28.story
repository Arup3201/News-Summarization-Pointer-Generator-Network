An Arizona couple is facing murder and child abuse charges for allegedly beating to death one of their 18-month-old twin daughters and leaving the other suffering severe trauma.

Parents Kristepher Benavidez, 25, and Monique Gaxiola, 30, were booked into a Tucson jail on Wednesday after authorities arrived at their home around 2:30 p.m. to find one of the twins was not breathing.

Firefighters rushed the baby to a nearby hospital where she died of her injuries on Friday.

Medical staff informed police soon after the child arrived in emergency that her injuries were non-accidental injuries.

Meanwhile, officers discovered two more children at a nextdoor neighbor's home and realized one of them, the other twin, had non-accidental injuries.

The child remains hospitalized in serious condition but is expected to survive.

The twins' seven-year-old sister did not appear to have any injuries. She is now in the custody of state Child Protective Services.

Benavidez and Gaxiola were booked into the Pima County Jail and charged with child abuse but the charge was upgraded to first-degree murder after their little girl died.

Detectives allege that the father had been physically abusing the twins and that the mother did not report it.

Tucson police spokesman Sgt. Chris Widmer said the mother was 'too afraid' to inform authorities.

Police are continuing to investigate the case.

Bail for Benavidez was set at $20,000 and Gaxiola's bail was set at $5,000. It is unclear whether it has increased since the charges were stepped up to first-degree murder.

Benavidez was arrested and faced drug charges in 2011.
