Crystal Palace have stolen ahead of West Bromwich Albion in the pursuit of Shola Ameobi.

Alan Pardew is keen to link up with the striker he knows from his Newcastle United days and bolster his attacking options.

West Brom were the first club to offer a deal to Ameobi, a free agent, but Palace are believed to have presented better terms.

The former Newcastle striker left Turkish club Gaziantep in December

The 33-year-old, seen as a player capable of making an impact from the bench in Palace’s fight against relegation, would sign on a short-term basis until the end of the season.

Ameobi scored 79 goals in 397 appearances for Newcastle before leaving St James’ Park last season after 14 years of service. 

The former Magpies forward moved to Gaziantep in August but left in December.
