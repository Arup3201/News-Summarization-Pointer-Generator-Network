A young mother who was eight-months pregnant has died along with her unborn child after she collapsed while brushing her teeth just two days after being sent home from hospital.

Jade Glen, 22, was found at her parents' home by her father on Monday after worried friends went to the house to find out why she had failed to answer her phone.

Today her boyfriend and family paid tribute to their 'golden girl and rock' and demanded answers from the NHS.

Tragedy: Jade Glen, 22, pictured with her son Mickey, was eight months pregnant when she collapsed and died along with her unborn child

Much-loved: Jade with her boyfriend Michael, who has called her his 'golden girl' and 'rock' and wants the NHS to explain why she was sent home

On Monday loved-ones who rushed to the house saw Jade's 18-month-old son Mickey wandering around inside with no sign of his mother.

Bereft: Jade was found on the bathroom floor with her tootbrush by her father Floyd

Her father Floyd Glen, 52, then found his child on the bathroom floor. The cold tap was still running and her toothbrush was lying next to her.

The young mother had been discharged from Medway Hospital in May after eight days of treatment for a suspected blood clot.

She returned to hospital on Saturday because she was feeling unwell, but after being checked, was sent home again.

Boyfriend Michael Arnold, 28, a tradesman, said: 'She was my golden girl, my rock.

'I can't understand why the doctors let her out - she was obviously ill but they told her she was OK. That hospital has got a lot of questions to answer.

'Jade was beautiful, so bubbly, and she loved her music. I just can't believe she's gone.'

Jade's mum, Trish Chart, 49, said: 'It is nice to know that she spent her last few hours with Mickey.

'She got to take him to his first day at playschool on Friday and she was so pleased to be able to do that. Mickey was everything to her.

'She had bought lots of things for Dolly and everything was ready.

'She was the funniest, most intelligent person you could meet. She was crazy - she would ring you up at 4am for a chat. But she was so generous and so kind. She had a heart of gold.'

Jade's Facebook page has been flooded with tributes, and her family have been inundated with messages of support.

Concerned: Friends were worried that Jade had failed to answer the phone so went round and saw Mickey wandering the house but no sign of his mother

Julie Poole wrote on Facebook: 'RIP beautiful angels. My whole family and me are so shocked and sad. Will always miss you Jade and still think of all the crazy times. You was feisty and fun and a real gem, family loving girl.'

Keziah Bangar wrote: 'Still can't believe what's happened. Jade was the cheekiest one and was always up for a laugh. So many good memories. You've touched everyone's lives and are extremely loved and missed by us all. You were never afraid to just be yourself and are beautiful.'

Jade's family are awaiting the results of a post-mortem to find out exactly how she died.

Her death has been referred to the coroner.

A spokesman for Medway Foundation Trust said: 'We offer our deepest condolences to the family and friends of Jade Glen.

'We are currently conducting a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding Jade's death.

'In addition of course there will be an independent external investigation.'
