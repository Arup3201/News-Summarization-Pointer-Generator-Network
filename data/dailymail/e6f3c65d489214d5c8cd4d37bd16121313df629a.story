Winter Olympic skeleton gold medallist Lizzy Yarnold is set for a return to competitive action this week as she continues the defence of her World Cup title in Altenberg, Germany.

The 26-year-old from Kent was forced to miss the second race of the season last month after experiencing dizziness during her victory at the season opener in Lake Placid.

But she has linked up with the British squad ahead of this Friday's heats and is relishing her return.

'I always enjoy competing in Europe as the tracks are varied and always challenging, the atmosphere is brilliant and lots of family and friends come out to support me which I love,' she said on British Skeleton's official website.

'I'm preparing for race three of the World Cup at the moment and there's lots more yet to come from all the Brits.

'We'll soon be in Igls, Austria (the seventh race of the season), where I won my first race in 2010 so I'd love to win another medal there.'

The reigning world and Olympic champion missed the second World Cup race but returns to action on Friday

Yarnold will be hoping to be as dominant in 2015 as she has been in the last 12 months - a year that saw her claim a historic Olympic and World Cup double.

In her absence in Calgary, British compatriot Laura Deas claimed her maiden medal at a World Cup with a second-place finish.
