You might admire these exotic-looking bouquets dripping with delicate blooms, but you'll never be able to buy one.

This is because the flowers do not exist - they are entirely the product of complex mathematical equations teamed with an artist's imagination.

London-based designer and digital artist Daniel Brown recently created the portfolio of strange posies for an installation at the D’Arcy Thompson Zoology Museum at the University of Dundee.

Magical: Digital artist Daniel Brown's flowers do not exist - they are entirely the product of complex mathematics mixed with his imagination

'I have been working on my flower series since around 2000,' Mr Brown told MailOnline.

'I realised that floral animation was a way that advanced computer technology could be related back to everyday culture.'

In 2003, however, Mr Brown suffered a 
devastating spinal injury following a swimming accident that left him 
paralysed from the shoulders down.

'It meant I could no longer draw or paint, but was fortunately still able
 to use an adapted computer,' he said.

'I find inspiration in many places,' said Mr Brown. 'Much of my work involves working on computer graphics for fashion, and through that often see a shape or texture, or even just the way light falls on an object- and think it would look fantastic on a flower'

Mr Brown used cutting edge 3D technology, more commonly used for computer games and cinema features, to create the realistic-looking flowers that resemble undiscovered orchids

'My flowers took on an extra significance 
then; by creating these flowers I could still create art.'

Mr
 Brown, who is unable to hold a pen, used cutting edge 3D technology 
that is more commonly used for computer games and cinema features.

Daniel brown was paralysed from the shoulders down after a swimming injury broke his neck. He is unable to use more than a finger to type so relies of formulae to 'paint' the flowers

'Much of my work involves working on computer graphics for fashion, and through that often see a shape or texture, or even just the way light falls on an object - and think it would look fantastic on a flower,' said Mr Brown

Apple's head of computer design Jonathan Ive said of Daniel's work: 
'Daniel Brown's work changes the way we look at and engage with digital imagery. It is technically innovative and emotionally engaging, but also gives us an extraordinary amount of freedom in the way we experience it'

Sir D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson  was a Scottish biologist, mathematician, and classics scholar.

D’Arcy Thompson’s master work was 'On Growth and Form'.

In this book he argued that biological form could reflect physical and mathematical principles.

For instance, he showed the similarity in the forms of jellyfish and the forms of drops of liquid falling into viscous fluid.

Daniel Brown's current series was originally entitled ‘On Growth and Form’ in homage to D’Arcy Thompson’s pioneering book.

Mr Brown uses a baseline algorithm to create a flower form that he adapts each time to create new, individual 'species'  - with no two flowers ever looking the same.

The 'photographs' were commissioned by the University Museum Services with grant funding from the Art Fund.

The work uses shapes and textures taken from and inspired by exhibits in the museum and is part of the museum’s ‘Renew’ programme'.

Mr Brown was inspired by Sir D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson's use of mathematical drawings to explain biology.

'I find inspiration in many places,' said Mr Brown. 'Much of my work involves working on 
computer graphics for fashion, and through that often see a shape or 
texture, or even just the way light falls on an object- and think it 
would look fantastic on a flower.'

'In many ways it is like creating 
artificial life.'

The current series was originally entitled ‘On Growth and Form’ in homage to D’Arcy Thompson’s pioneering book written in 1915.

In this book, Sir Thompson argued that biological form, and in turn evolutionary principles, could be explained with mathematical principles.

Previous
 pieces from Mr Brown's series have been exhibited at the London Design Museum 
and a three-story-high projected version was commissioned by the 
Victoria & Albert as the entrance feature for their 'Decode – 
Digital Art Sensations' show that took place from December 
2009 to April 2010.

Mr Brown was voted Designer of the Year in 2004 – the year after Apple's head of computer design Jonathan Ive was also awarded this major national accolade.

'Daniel Brown's work changes the way we look at and engage with digital imagery,' said Mr Ive. 'It is technically innovative and emotionally engaging, but also gives us an extraordinary amount of freedom in the way we experience it.'
