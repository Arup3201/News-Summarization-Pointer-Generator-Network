Whenever England lose we always blame them and say they are rubbish but when they win we can be reluctant to give them full credit and instead say that the opposition are terrible. The truth here lies somewhere in between.

Yes, India were awful but that was because of how good England’s seam attack were, in particular Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad. That was as hard as batting gets in Test cricket because England’s big two have been phenomenal.

Lord’s was almost like a light-bulb moment for England. It was as low as they could get. Sometimes you need to hit rock bottom before you can hit back and it was so bad after the second Test that England’s senior players seemed to say ‘we might as well just go out and enjoy it now and see what happens.’

Captain fantastic: Alastair Cook will be in high spirits after his side claimed a 3-1 win over India

Certainly Alastair Cook seemed relaxed at the toss at the Ageas Bowl, as if he had nothing more to lose, and he deserves so much credit for what has happened since then.

Many people, myself included, doubted Cook and rightly so because I have always believed there was a lot of potential in this new England side and outside it with the likes of Alex Hales, James Taylor and Jason Roy and something must have been wrong for them to go 10 Test matches without a victory.

So for Cook to have a good long look at himself and turn things around shows the incredible mental toughness of the man. A lot of people would have said ‘enough’s enough, I will just go back and bat’ which is what I wanted because his runs have always been so important to England. Instead he has proved us all wrong.

Now he must remember why things have changed and what he and England have done to reverse their fortunes. So many of the things he did wrong have disappeared in the last three games. 

The field placings to tail-enders, putting everybody on the boundary for Angelo Mathews, not bowling Moeen Ali for hours on end, over-bowling Jimmy Anderson so he was exhausted. Cook has changed but he needed to because he was being tactically naïve.

To have the clarity of thought to change when you are so low shows that this is a special guy. Yes Cook has had a bit of luck along the way but he has deserved that after all he has been through for nine months. He’s a good guy who has only ever done what he felt was best for the health of English cricket.

Work still needs to be done on his batting. There was evidence of the problems he has had over the last year in the way he got out on Saturday. But he is getting there with the runs he has scored both here and in Southampton.

Peter Moores has proved the right coach for this England team, too. He was the right man, after Lord’s, to question people and challenge them.

It didn’t work out the first time he was coach because he was dealing with a few senior players who did not want to be challenged but I think this crop actually do want that. And that’s both the young and senior ones.

Yet beating an Indian side who have only won one Test away from home in three years is one thing. Taking on Australia and Mitchell Johnson is quite another. England must identify the areas where they need to improve and look after Anderson and Broad for that spell of 17 Tests in just nine months that follows the World Cup.

But don’t be fearful of Australia. England, with so many players coming through, are a team to invest in. They are on an upward curve. Australia, meanwhile, have got some older players who might be going in the other direction. Let us see. There is much to look forward to.
