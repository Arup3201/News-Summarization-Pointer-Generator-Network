This toe-tapping performance takes in-flight entertainment to a whole new level.  

Simian King from Quebec, Canada, filmed the moment his air stewardess sister busted some while waiting for passengers to board a WestJet flight.

Footage shows the sassy brunette swinging her hips and pumping her fists in the air as Bruno Mars' Uptown Funk starts to play over the intercom.

With only around three feet of space to work with, she keeps her moves tight.

King says that his sibling is a trained breakdancer and can easily pull off backflips and headspins among other tricks.

Along with dozens of passengers, the pilot is also seen turned in his seat watching the impromptu show.

At one point King's sister - wearing her work uniform and black leather boots - pretends to play the guitar, enthusiastically strumming the strings to the beat.

The audience are heard laughing as they watch the scene unfold.

After around 20 seconds the music cuts and the act comes to an end. 

'All right, round of applause,' one man can be heard saying as other start to cheer and clap.

King uploaded the clip to YouTube on March 9 and to date it has been viewed more than 90,000 times.

Many viewers have applauded the flight attendant for her performance.

'That's the cutest thing I've seen all day,' one commenter wrote.

Another added: 'It's inspiring to see people sharing their passions in the places you would least expect!'
