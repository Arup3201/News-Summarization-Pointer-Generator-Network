A couple forced to wait 26 hours for a delayed flight home from Majorca have won a payout in a case that could open the floodgates to thousands more like it.

Kim Brittain, 61, and his wife Sue, 55, sued charter airline Monarch after they were among 200 tourists stranded at Palma de Mallorca Airport.

Their case is one of the first of its kind in the British courts.

It comes after the European Court of Justice declared last October that airlines must pay compensation for delays caused by their own failures, such as technical faults and staff problems.

Victory! Kim Brittain, 61, and wife Sue, 55, took on Monarch Airlines when it refused to pay out compensation for a day-long delay, and have now won £430 using new legislation from Brussels

Mr Brittain, an architect, said Monarch had tried to ‘bully’ him and his wife, refusing to pay them for the delay and dragging them through the courts.

They said they fought the claim because 180,000 people are faced with similar holiday problems every year and they should ‘know their rights’.

On July 3 last year they were due to fly back to Birmingham Airport at 10.45am but their flight did not take off until 12.42pm the next day – 25 hours and 57 minutes later.

Passengers were left to wander around the airport terminal in  sweltering heat and were handed food stamps for meals, which  they had to supplement with their own cash.

Big guns: Monarch Airlines were branded 'bullies' by the couple because they sent in two barristers to contest the £430 compensation claim

They said staff were unhelpful and 
police officers threatened some tourists with arrest when they became 
frustrated and filmed what was happening on their mobile phones.

Monarch eventually sent a bus and took
the passengers to a hotel but they arrived there just 20 minutes before
the restaurant closed, giving them little time to have a meal.

Under new EU rules, airlines must pay compensation for cancelled or heavily delayed flights, unless there are 'extraordinary circumstances'.

This can include sudden severe weather events, such as a hurricane orsomething like the volcanic ash cloud episode of three years ago.

The ruling that outlines these rights is Regulation (EC) 261/2004, and this became law earlier this year.

Compensation is around €250 (£210) for inter-EU flights of 930 miles or less, €400 (£330) for flights between 930 and 1,860 miles and €600 (£500) for other journeys.

It applies to any flight leaving an EU airport and any flight into the EU on an EU-based airline.

This means any direct flight from the UK should be covered, along with any flight to it run by a European airline.

Passengers can claim by telling the airline their flight number, names and reason for the delay. If rejected, they can take their case to court.

Airlines will often try and claim extraordinary circumstances to avoid paying, such as by citing technical faults as being covered by this.

However, extraordinary circumstances are judged to be something unexpected and out of an airline's control, and it can be argued that an airline should be prepared for mechanical problems as a matter of course and these are not extraordinary.

The nub of the matter is that if your flight is delayed by more than three hours, cancelled or overbooked, you may be able to claim.

Upset by their experience, Mr and Mrs 
Brittain, from Wythall in Worcestershire, applied to Monarch for 
compensation.

But the airline refused to pay, saying the delay was 
caused by ‘exceptional circumstances’.

Refusing to back down, the  Brittains 
took the case to court and a judge at Worcester County Court awarded 
them their full compensation claim of £430, plus legal costs.

The ruling follows a judgment last 
October in which the European courts found passengers should be entitled
to compensation of up to £480, plus expenses, for hold-ups longer than 
three hours.

At the time airlines were warned the 
ruling could cost them millions by opening the floodgates for hundreds 
of thousands of claims.

In January Jeff and Joyce Halsall, 
from Kidsgrove, Staffordshire, became the first people in the UK to 
benefit from the ruling, winning a case against Thomas Cook after 
waiting 22 hours for a return flight from Tenerife to East Midlands 
Airport.

Yesterday, Mr Brittain spoke of his delight at winning his case.

‘They treated us like cattle,’ he 
said. ‘I’d had enough. I was faced with two barristers and their  
solicitors but I thought: “I’m semi-retired, I have the time to do it, 
let’s have a go.”

‘The airlines try to scare people off 
with the prospect of court proceedings but I knew we were in the right 
and decided to fight it.

‘Monarch sought to defend a case they 
had no chance of winning  and spent thousands of pounds instead of 
settling on day one. The fact they chose to do so I saw as a bully boy 
tactic and I’m glad the judge agreed.’

The couple will now donate the compensation to sight charity Focus, where Mrs Brittain works.

Monarch said it was considering an appeal against the ruling and could not comment further.
