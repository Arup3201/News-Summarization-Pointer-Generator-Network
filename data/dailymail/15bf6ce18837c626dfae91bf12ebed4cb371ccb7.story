A World War II heroine spy who topped the Gestapo’s wanted list after her daring exploits behind enemy lines helped pave the way for the D-Day landings has died aged 98.

Nancy Wake, who inspired the film Charlotte Gray after becoming one the Allies' most decorated servicewomen for her role in the French resistance, passed away in a nursing home in London yesterday.

The Australian, who the Nazis codenamed 'The White Mouse' due to the ease with which she escaped capture, left strict instructions to be cremated in a private ceremony.

'Exceptional courage': Nancy Wake in 2004, left, and in 1945 after she had helped French resistance prepare the ground for the D-Day landings. She is credited with saving the lives of hundreds of Allied soldiers

She wants her ashes to be scattered at Montlucon in central France, where she fought in a heroic 1944 attack on the local Gestapo headquarters.

Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard today said: ‘Nancy Wake was a woman of exceptional courage and resourcefulness whose daring exploits saved the lives of hundreds of Allied personnel and helped bring the Nazi occupation of France to an end.’

Miss Wake, who had no children and was the widow of British fighter pilot John Forward, once famously said she was ‘sorry I didn’t kill more Nazis’.

Second World War heroine Nancy joined the French resistance in 1940.

And within three years, her reputation was so great that the Germans put a huge price on her head – 5million francs.

Despite having her mail and phone calls intercepted, she remained ice cool and undetected – even when the network was betrayed in 1943.

Somehow she managed to escape to Britain, where she signed up to the Special Operations Executive.

She was quickly parachuted back into enemy territory, where she bravely led attacks on German and Gestapo facilities.

The pinnacle of her remarkable career, however, may well have been a battle she fought in 1944 with 7,000 French liberation fighters against 22,000 SS troops.

The Germans suffered 1,400 losses – the French, despite being heavily outnumbered, just 100.

At one stage of the operation an SS sentry came close to raising the alarm – but Ms Wake killed him with her bare hands.

In an interview she conducted later about the incident, she illustrated how she neutralised the guard by simply drawing her finger across her throat.

On one occasion in 1944, supply drops were threatened after the Nazis destroyed crucial radio codes.

Nancy cycled 300 miles in 72 hours, crossing several German checkpoints, so she could find an operator to radio Britain and get new codes.

One of her comrades in the Resistance, Henri Tardivat, later described her as 'the most feminine woman I know, until the fighting starts. Then, she
is like five men.'

It’s no wonder that she received no fewer than 12 medals of honour from Britain, Australia, France, New Zealand and the U.S.

Trained by British intelligence in 
espionage and sabotage, Wake helped to arm and lead 7,000 resistance 
fighters in weakening German defences before the D-Day invasion in the 
last months of the war.

While
distributing weapons, money and code books in Nazi-occupied France, she
evaded capture many times and reached the top of the Gestapo's wanted 
list, according to her biographer, Peter FitzSimons.

‘They
called her the 'la Souris Blanche,' 'the White Mouse,' because every 
time they had her cornered ... she was gone again,’ FitzSimons told 
Australian Broadcast Corp. radio on Monday.

‘Part of it was she was a gorgeous looking woman,’ he said.

‘The Germans were looking for someone who looked like them: aggressive, a man with guns - and she was not like that.’

France decorated her with its highest military honour, the Legion d'Honneur, as well as three Croix de Guerre and the Medaille de la Resistance.

The United States awarded her its Medal of Freedom and Britain, the George Medal.

Her only Australian honour did not come until 2004, when she was made a Companion of the Order of Australia.

Born on August 30, 1912, in the New Zealand capital of Wellington, Nancy Grace Augusta Wake was the youngest of six siblings.

When she was two the family moved to Sydney, but her father left the family soon after and returned to New Zealand.

Miss Wake became a nurse before an inheritance from a New Zealand aunt enabled her to run away from home in 1931 and fulfil her dream of travelling to New York, London and Paris, she said in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corp. in 1985.

After studying journalism in London, 
she became a correspondent for The Chicago Tribune in Paris and reported
on the rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany.

A 1933 trip to interview Hitler
in Vienna led her to become committed to bringing down the Nazis.

‘I
saw the disagreeable things that he was doing to people, first of all 
the Jews,’ she told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio in 1985. ‘I 
thought it was quite revolting.’

When
World War II broke out in 1939, she was living in the French city of 
Marseille with her first husband, French industrialist Henri Fiocca.

She
helped British servicemen and Jews escape the German occupying force.

Her husband was eventually seized, tortured and killed by the Gestapo.

But Wake managed to escape in 1943 through Spain to London, where she received the espionage training before helping to lead the French resistance in its final days.

Wake continued working for British intelligence in Europe after the war until 1957, when she moved back to Australia and married Mr Forward.

She moved back to Britain in 2001, four years after his death.
