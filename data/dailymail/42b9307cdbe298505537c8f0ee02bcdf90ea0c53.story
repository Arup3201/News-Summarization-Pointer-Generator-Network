Holidaymakers flying to France and Portugal have been warned of possible disruption because of industrial action.

In France, easyJet's pilots are threatening to walk out in a dispute over pay.

They plan to take action tomorrow and again on August 17 and 19.

The budget airline said it was in discussions with the French pilot union SNPL and hoped that disruption would be minimal as the strikes would involve only French-based crews.

However, it advised passengers to check their flight status before heading to the airport.

The stoppage in France may include up to 250 staff. If it goes ahead it will affect many easyJet flights in France but not all the airline's flights to and from the country.

To increase the impact, the walkout coincides with the busy Assumption Day holiday period in France.

A spokesman for the airline said: 'The company regrets that some of its pilots have chosen to move ahead with an industrial action rather than coming back to the negotiations table, particularly in this busy period for holidaymakers.

'The management remains open to discussion and calls the SNPL union representatives to resume negotiations.'

It is not the only imminent threat of industrial action which could impact on British holidaymakers.

Staff at Portugal's Oporto and Faro airports are also threatening strike action on August 15 and 17.

EasyJet operates more than 600 routes in 30 countries and transported 55million passengers in 2011.

France and Portugal are among the most popular destinations during the school holiday period.
