On Wednesday police carried out a raid at an Islamic bookstore, a gym and seven other premises in Logan and Brisbane.

Crossbows, a firearm and electronic data were seized when about 180 Queensland Police and AFP Police officers executed the nine search warrants.

AFP national manager counter terrorism Assistant Commissioner Neil Gaughan said police found no intelligence to suggest the two men were planning a terrorism attack in Australia.

There was also no suggestion they were planning to target the G20 Summit which will be held in Brisbane this November.

He said there were no other suspects in Australia in relation to the year-long investigation, codenamed Operation Bolton, but he said there were links to Syria and the investigation was ongoing.

Australian Federal Police conducted a raid at iQraa Islamic Centre on Logan Rd in Underwood on Wednesday morning and bullet holes were found in one of the windows.

Omar Succarieh, who is connected to the bookshop, is the brother of Australia's first suicide bomber to die in Syria, Ahmed Succarieh.

The centre also raised money for two 'sermons' by Perth-based Islamic preacher Mohammed Junaid Thorne, who has posted support for terrorist group ISIS on social media and has been monitored by the federal government, The Courier Mail reported.

The 25-year-old, who was deported from Saudi Arabia last year for protesting his older brother Shayden's imprisonment on terrorism-related offences, has previously been accused of being a radical preacher for allegedly praising militants responsible for beheadings and mass killings in Iraq in June.

A centre Facebook post on September 6 rejected reports it was promoting extremism.

'Islam and this centre does NOT tolerate extremism but not what the disbelievers portray extremism is,' the post read.

'We do not discriminate either, so we have allowed many speakers to come and give lectures and share their views here.'

Last month, the centre was a signatory to a statement from the wider Muslim community denouncing proposals to strengthen Australia's counter-terrorism measures.

The Abbott government's proposed laws will make it easier for authorities to identify, charge and prosecute people who have been engaged in training, fighting or supporting terrorist activities overseas.

The group statement, signed by iQraa and others, described the proposals as 'unjust and unjustified'.

'The primary basis of these laws is a trumped up 'threat' from 'radicalised' Muslims returning from Iraq or Syria,' the statement read.

'There is no solid evidence to substantiate this threat.'

The iQraa Islamic Centre is believed to have hosted a lecture this year on what followers should do if they were contacted by ASIO.

Outgoing ASIO chief David Irvine on Tuesday said the spy organisation was actively considered raising Australia's terror threat level, from medium to high.
