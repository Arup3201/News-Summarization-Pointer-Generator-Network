Two young children were accidentally shot to death by similarly-aged relatives this weekend in Georgia, authorities said.

Police say Montrez Burroughs, 11, of Jacksonville, was shot by a 12-year-old relative Friday night while visiting relatives in Savannah. Taylor Jowers, 10, of Waycross, Georgia, was reportedly shot dead at home by her brother. Both victims were shot in the chest.

No adults were around in either instance, according to reports, but charges have been filed only in the Savannah shooting.

Burroughs was shot around 9.00 p.m. Friday night across the street from the home he was staying at in West Savannah.

He and his mother had just moved from the coastal Georgia town to Jacksonville, but were in town for the weekend visiting family, relatives told WTOC. He and his suspected shooter often played together.

The playmates were playing with a fake gun prior to finding a real one, cousin Denisha Coppock said, adding she had seen him shortly before his killing.

‘Your life is precious like that, it can be taken away just like that, because I just seen him 15 minutes before that, and it happened so fast,’ she said.

Where it happened: The Savannah home where Burroughs was shot dead

The tragically killed boy loved to play sports. His Facebook profile is filled with pictures of him playing football.

Family are upset the gun’s owner has not come forward to at the very least apologize to them for the boy’s death, and believe he should also be charged.

‘I think the parent and the child need to be charged,’ aunt Shaleena Hamilton told WTEV. ‘Because you have to take charge of your household and you have to be responsible for what goes on in your house.’

The accused shooter was charged with involuntary manslaughter, reckless conduct and possession of a firearm by a person under the age of 18, records showed.

Reports have said the shooter was either a cousin or nephew. Also not clear is if the boy’s father will face any charges.

A message the Savannah Police Department seeking further information has yet to be returned.

Jowers’ death is equally negligent and tragic.

Investigators have determined that she was asked by her 15-year-old brother to hold a 12-gauge shotgun while he made sure it wasn’t loaded, the Florida Times-Union reported.

The gun accidentally discharged.

The brother panicked and ran to a neighbor’s house for help.

‘He just said that his sister was shot,’ the neighbor told WJXT. ‘I called the ambulance and all the responders and everything got out here as fast as they could and tried to help her as much as they could.’

She was pronounced dead at the scene, police said.

Jowers' parents were both working at the time she was shot, according to reports.

A Ware County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson  declined to confirm or deny her brother was the suspected shooter, saying only that it is 'an older relative.'

When asked whether an involuntary manslaughter or similar charge is being considered against the relative is being considered, the spokesperson said only that the incident is still under investigation.
