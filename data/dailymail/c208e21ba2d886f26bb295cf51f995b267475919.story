A millionaire poker player dubbed 'Instagram's Biggest Playboy' has been captured on video throwing a naked porn star off his roof, leaving her with a broken foot.

Dan Bilzerian, who shares snaps of his hard-partying lifestyle of naked women, private planes, luxury yachts and powerful weapons with his 1.4 million Instagram followers, decided to throw 19-year-old Janice Griffith from the roof of his Hollywood Hills mansion during a photo shoot on Wednesday.

A video of the incident shared on LiveLeak shows him scooping up the naked teen, lifting her above his shoulder and throwing her from the roof to a pool below.

Carefree: Dan Bilzerian, known as 'Instagram's Biggest Playboy', can be seen lifting up naked teenage porn star Janice Griffith on the roof of his Hollywood Hills mansion on Wednesday

Going over: She doesn't look too concerned as he carries her to the edge and flings her over

But she apparently grabbed on to his t-shirt at the last second and could be heard screaming as she fell into the water, Elite Daily noted.

'I broke my foot today,' she later wrote on Twitter.

On Thursday, she added: 'I was looking forward to shooting for @SexAndSub SO bad today, stupid broken foot.'

But Bilzerian refused to take the blame and retweeted a message that said: 'Dan Bilzerian was almost murdered by a naked female that tried to pull him off a rooftop hahaha good thing he's part hulk.'

Before: Earlier this year Bilzerian was filmed hurling a teenage porn star off of a roof into a swiming pool below. She says the impact broke her foot and she couldn't work

Falling: She falls out of the view of the camera but hits the water - although later revealed she broke her foot

Bilzerian is reportedly worth $100 million, making the bulk of his cash as a high-stakes gambler after developing his skills as a student at the University of South Florida.

He has won multiple tournaments, his 
most successful being the 2009 World Series of Poker. He is also 
co-founder of online poker room, Victory Poker.

Before gambling, he served with the Navy before eventually getting kicked out of SEAL training two days before graduating for offending an officer. He was ultimately given an honorable discharge.

He lives extravagantly with homes in Las Vegas, San Diego and Los Angeles, and his Instagram photos show the hard partying between their walls.

Wealthy: Bilzeran, who is worth around $100 million, is pictured aboard a private plane with his cat

Gun lover: Bilzerian also often posts pictures showing guns, including this one saying, 'I picked the #bosshog'

The images are packed with mounds of cash, 
guns, 
supercars with license plates reading ‘SUCK IT’ and girls - many of whom are mostly naked and fawning over him.

'Basically I didn't get a ton of attention as a kid, I guess that's why I’m such a flashy lunatic,' he previously told MailOnline. 'I'm like a big kid. But it's not like a called myself the Instagram King. I put up what people want to see and that just happened.'

However, his risky lifestyle has resulted in some serious repercussions, including a double heart attack and a pulmonary embolism.

And now he claims he has begun making plans for a different existence.

Not the first time! Another image shows him jumping from the roof to the pool with a female friend

He has part financed several feature films including Lone Survivor with Mark Wahlberg, which tells the story of Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell and a failed mission in Afghanistan in 2005.

He has small roles in two other upcoming films – The Other Woman and The Equalizer –and is in the midst of developing a horror film. 

He has also been giving to charity as part of his attempt to rebrand from playboy to 'gentleman of poker'.

Among the donations, he has given $100,000 to Typhoon Haiyan victims and the $20,000 to a family who adopted four children with terrible birth defects only for one of them to develop leukemia.
