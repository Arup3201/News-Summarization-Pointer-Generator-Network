Gulsen allegedly Tasered the boy in the upper left arm with a stun gun at around 4pm at his grandparents' house.

The victim told police that he had asked his mother 'why are you looking at me like that', causing her to curse at him repeatedly, saying she would talk to him anyway she wanted and calling him a 'motherf*****'.

The alleged attack took placed inside the grandparents' home during which an aunt began striking the boy in the head and body multiple times, according to a police report seen by Daily Mail Online.  

At the time the mother was 'egging on' the aunt and telling her to 'beat him'. The aunt has since flown back to New York, according to the sheriff's report. 

Moments later, the teenager was Tasered by his mother outside the home.

The grandparents told police that they believe the mother is a danger to her son,  often inflicts emotional trauma  and has previously threatened to kill him.

Gulsen was booked at the Flagler County jail on $2,500 bond before posting bail and being released. 

A sheriff's spokesman told Daily Mail Online that The Department of Children and Family was notified and arranged for the youth to be placed with the grandparents. 

A court date has not yet been scheduled.
