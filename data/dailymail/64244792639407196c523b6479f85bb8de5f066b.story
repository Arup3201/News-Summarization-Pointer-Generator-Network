Police have launched a murder investigation after a man was found shot dead in woods.

The 31-year-old male was discovered by two teenage schoolboys in woodland in Chapel Allerton, Leeds, shortly after 8am yesterday morning.

Detectives working to establish the cause of death said they could confirm he had been shot.

Detective Superintendent Simon Beldon said: 'We are now treating this man's death as murder and we are conducting extensive enquiries to establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

'A key focus for the investigation at the moment is on tracing any potential witnesses who saw or heard anything suspicious in the area late last night and into the early hours of this morning.

'Although we are still awaiting the full findings of the forensic post mortem we can now say that the man had received injuries consistent with a firearm having been discharged.

'We are therefore particularly keen to hear from anyone who heard a bang or who saw anyone or any vehicles in the vicinity that could be linked to the incident.

'Our enquiries are at an early stage but it appears that this has been a targeted attack. Although this incident will understandably shock people in the community we don't believe there is any wider risk to the general public.

'I would urge anyone with any information that could assist the investigation to contact us immediately.'

Lara Morley, who lives nearby, told the Yorkshire Evening Post: 'I was on my way home from work when I saw several police cars.

'A large section of the woods is cordoned off. Itâ€™s a shock.'

Anyone with any information is asked to contact Protective Services (Crime) via 101 quoting log number 217 of March 11 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
