Violence erupted last night after thousands of airline passengers faced hours of chaos because of a glitch in a central immigration computer.

Travellers were told to expect delays of up to four hours as border staff struggled to cope with growing queues in arrival halls at every British airport.

There were reports of fights breaking out at Gatwick as passengers took to Twitter to vent their frustration about queues stretching ‘for miles’.

Furious travellers last night described the scenes as ‘a disgrace and a national embarrassment’, with many complaining about a lack of information.

One passenger at Gatwick reported that passengers were turning violent. Kay Perry tweeted: ‘Gatwick airport chaos. Fights break out among passengers as queues reach for miles.’

Another posting mocked the airport, saying: ‘Well done Heathrow airport. I’ve spent longer in this immigration queue than in the air.’

Frustrated passenger David Logue questioned Gatwick Airport on Twitter, but his comments went unanswered.

He said: ‘MASSIVE queues to get through arrivals. What on earth is going wrong? Need to be quicker if you want to compete with LHR’ [London Heathrow].

He added: ‘There must be over 500  people in this ‘pen’ alone but I’m not allowed to photograph.

‘Hundreds of people stuck in the heat. Get water!’

 City airport said that on top of massive queues, travellers were made 
to stand on the runway when a fire alarm went off.

Passenger Simon Coleman who flew into Luton Airport from Barcelona on easyJet described the scene at the airport as 'organised chaos' .

He told BBC Radio 5 Live that he had spent two hours getting through immigration and that fighting had broken out among frustrated passengers.

Luton airport later later confirmed that police had been called to deal with 'scuffles ' in the immigration hall but that no arrests had been made.

Mr Coleman described scenes as 'chaotic' and said that pregnant mothers were in clear distress.

He said easyjet had texted them about problems, but only after they were experiencing them.

Passengers said immigration staff were manually typing in names and dates of birth because they were unable to scan them.

Non-EU travellers were hardest hit, with international arrivals queues snaking around airport terminals.

The computer glitch is the latest humiliation for the Home Office’s beleaguered UK Border Force – and the biggest disaster since the widespread queue chaos before the 2012 Olympics.

Problems began mid-afternoon with waiting times at Heathrow immigration quickly growing to an hour, according to officials. Airport staff handed out water to stranded passengers.

Heathrow posted on its Twitter feed: ‘A nationwide UK Border Force IT issue is creating delays for arriving Non-EU passengers. Extra staff are on hand.’

The airport said the worst affected area was Terminal 3 and 4 – which are used by carriers including Virgin Atlantic, American Airlines, Qantas and Air India.

British Airways, in Terminal 5, said it was liaising with the Border Force to ‘minimise disruption’. 

Britain’s largest airport said extra staff were drafted in to try and reduce the queues.

Passengers there also reported problems at passport control desks, mostly affecting those trying to enter  the country.

A BA spokesman said: ‘This is clearly an issue beyond our control and affecting all airlines, but we are doing everything we can to protect our customers.

'Obviously we want to sort the issue out but not risk the integrity of the border controls.’

At Gatwick, Chris Hyland, a  32-year-old company director from Islington, north London, said  international passengers had been told to expect a wait of up to  four hours.

He said: ‘We landed from Geneva at 5.20pm but it took until 6.40pm for us to get through passport  control. It’s an absolute nightmare. We’ve been told there is an IT  failure but that’s it.’

He added: ‘You would have thought there would be a back-up plan.’

Mr Hyland said non-EU passengers are preparing for a long wait to officially enter the country.

He said: ‘It is very frustrating. Nobody is really saying anything. The international queue is pretty huge, so people have already started sitting down because they know they will be there for a long, long time.’

A Gatwick spokesman said: ‘We are experiencing similar [problems] to the rest of the airports, and we are working to get people through.

'People should be able to get off the plane, it is those coming through the immigration process which it is frustrating.’ 

The spokesman said there should not be any delays to flights leaving UK airports.

Birmingham Airport said problems appeared to be ‘getting  progressively worse’.

Frustrated passengers described how some desks were unmanned. Problems began mid-afternoon with waiting times at immigration increasing throughout the day

However, Manchester Airport said queues had subsided after ‘slight delays’.

A
 spokesman for the Border Force apologised for the delays and added: ‘We
 are currently experiencing temporary IT problems which may add to the 
time taken to conduct passport checks.

‘We
 are working to rectify this issue and are providing extra staff to get 
passengers through the controls as quickly as possible.

‘Our priority remains security of the border.’

Asked
 last night if passport checks had been relaxed to ease the queues, the 
Home Office simply said its ‘priority remains security of the border’.

The problems affected every British airport, including Birmingham International, pictured, where a spokesman said: 'It appears to be getting progressively worse but we are hoping it will be sorted out soon'
