Socialist Herbert Morrison, the grandfather of Labour grandee Lord Mandelson, became one of the most famous examples of the 16,000 men who refused to fight during the First World War as a matter or principle. 

The young activist - who went on to become a prominent figure in the Labour party- rallied against what he believed was a conflict between two capitalist nations, waged to protect the empire.

Morrison, then 28 (left), who believed the war was a capitalist fight, was seen as a radical activist and went on to inspire his grandson Lord Mandleson (right) to pursue a career in politics 

So, despite being exempt from service because he was blind in one eye, Morrison registered as a conscientious objector, amid conscription laws which enlisted two-and-a-half million British troops from 1916.

In return for his exemption, following a 'tribunal' in Wandsworth, Morrison joined a group of fellow objectors who worked the land in Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire.

While there, he met his wife Margaret, a handweaver and embroider.  

According to one historian, the commune became infamous in satirical magazines which portrayed the men as being 'a group of vegetarian, beardy weirdies in home-spun tweed'.

While at the garden, Morrison - pictured aged 28 - apparently tried to sabotage the war effort in his own way by pulling up fledgling cabbages and cauliflowers and leaving the weeds in the ground. 

Years later, Labour politician Michael Foot described Morrison as a 'suburban Stalin'.  

'Conchies', as they were known, attracted considerable stigma among their peers.

Those who objected to the war had to appeal in public before they were put through a 'tribunal'.

Many were granted a 'conditional exemption'. This meant they were exempt from conscription, but had to take on medical roles and other 'work of national importance', usually on the roads and land.

Some objectors carried out dangerous and vital work, such as stretcher-bearing. But many others refused to be involved in any part of the war machine.

They then faced imprisonment if they refused to join up.

During the war, Morrison continued working with the Labour party and later became a significant figure in Government 

Morrison himself experienced backlash for his radical views. He once revealed how he was dragged by an irate group towards a duck pond, as he pontificated about his views on the war.

Speaking about the incident, he said: 'I remember an open air meeting on Hampstead Heath one Sunday morning. I had given the audience my views as to the cause of the war, and expressed my conviction that the involvement of Britain in it had been wrong.

'My audience was very hostile. I spoke amid a great deal of violent and angry heckling.

'Ultimately I was dragged off the platform and dragged by force to a nearby pond. There was some dispute at the edge of the pond, however, when the police intervened, and although my prince-nez glasses were flung into the water, I was not.

'This was a common experience among the anti-war speakers, although some of them did get a ducking.' 

Morrison went on to become a prominent figure in the Labour Party and served in Ramsey MacDonald's government in the late 1920s.

Ironically, he was appointed by Winston Churchill as Home Secretary during the coalition government of the Second World War - a conflict he supported because he said it was against a fascist regime.

There were 16,000 conscientious objectors during the First World War, who refused to fight, usually on moral or religious grounds.  

'Conchies', as they became known, attracted considerable stigma among peers.

Those who objected to joining up had to appeal in public before they were put through a 'tribunal'.

Many were granted a 'conditional exemption', allowing them to be exempt from conscription, as long as they agreed to take on other work.

This usually included dangerous non-combat medical roles such as working as a stretcher-bearer or driving an ambulance.

Others were sent to carry out 'work of national importance', such as working on the roads or farming.

But some still refused to be involved in any part of the war machine. 

If their arguments were rejected by the tribunals, then they had to decide whether to wait to be arrested, or go against their beliefs.  

Once drafted into the Army, men disobeying orders faced a court martial which could lead to imprisonment. 

Out of the 16,000, 4,500 objectors were sent to do work of national importance such as farming, 7,000 were ordered non-combatant duties, while 6000 were forced into the army - many of whom were sent to prison. 

Thirty-five objectors were taken to France and formally sentenced to death but immediately reprieved to ten years in prison.

Conditions were made hard for conscientious objector prisoners — ten died in prison, and around seventy died elsewhere as a result of their treatment.

In the Second World War, there were nearly 60,000 registered Conscientious Objectors. 

Years later, Morrison inspired his daughter's son, Lord Mandelson, to join the Labour Party and break into politics.

Now the photo - which has been digitally-colourised - is being featured in the Herts at War project,a  community-led project to commemorate the First World War. 

Dan Hill, of Herts at War, said: 'Herbert Morrison was perhaps the most well known of all conscientious objectors in The Great War.

'His lot was certainly not an easy one. Conchies were scorned in the street, disowned by family, friends and neighbours and generally regarded as cowards by the general population.

'Letchworth Garden City, a free-thinking town, attracted huge numbers of like-minded people during the Great War, including Herbert, who was employed in a market garden just outside the town.

'He regularly made the commute to London to continue his work as Labour Party Secretary.

'Today his objections to global conflict seem reasonable, although it is important to note that his opposition to the war was very radical.

'We are pleased to acknowledge his contribution during the Great War, albeit far from the fighting front.'

Terry Charman, a historian and author of the book 'First World War on the Home Front,  which covers conscientious objectors, said: 'Many people in society gave conscientious objectors a hard time.

'Shopkeepers refused to serve them while others generally treated them with scorn and hostility.' 

He continued said: 'Herbert Morrison became a leading light in the Labour Party. He wanted to be the leader but was stopped in his tracks by Clement Attlee.

'In World War One he was a conscientious objector although he was blind in one eye and wouldn't have been called up anyway.

'But he wanted to take a stand and make a point and denounced the war in a series of articles in newspapers.

'A lot of left wing people in World War One were opposed to the war as it was two capitalist empires.

'There were 16,000 conscientious objectors compared to six million men who served in the armed forces.'

He added: 'Morrison went before a tribunal at Wandsworth where he agreed to undertake alternative service of working on the land in Letchworth Garden City.

'Theirs was a rather famous commune of conscientious objectors and they were satirised by magazines like Punch as being a group of vegetarian, beardy weirdies in home-spun tweed. Years later Michael Foot described Herbert Morrison as a suburban Stalin.

'He was attacked by both sides for it, his fellow conscientious objectors thought that by agreeing to the land service he had sold out and he should have gone to prison for his principles while he was viewed as a coward by the other side.'

Herbert Morrison was born in Stockwell, south London, the son of a police officer.

As a baby, he became blind in his right eye due to an infection. That infection would later lead to him being exempt from being called up to fight in the First World War - though he also registered as a conscientious objector.

Morrison went to Stockwell Road Primary School, before leaving at age 14 to become an errand boy.

He became interested in politics as a teenager, briefly becoming involved with the Social Democratic Federation over the Independent Labour Party (ILP).

Later, during the war, he worked in a market garden in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, after registering as a conscientious objector. There, he met his wife Margaret, a handweaver and embroiderer. 

During the war, Morrison continued his day trips to London to work for the Labour party.

He went on to become a prominent figure in the party and served in Ramsey MacDonald's government in the late 1920s.

Morrison held a variety of senior positions in the Cabinet, including Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister. 

He was appointed by Winston Churchill as Home Secretary during the coalition government of the Second World War - a conflict he supported because he said it was against a fascist regime.

Morrison, alongside Clement Attlee and Ernest Bevin, formed the triumvirate that dominated the Labour governments of 1945-51.

He was Attlee’s deputy and was a shoe-in to become Attlee’s successor. But Attlee disliked him and postponed stepping down until 1955, when Morrison was too old.

Morrison organised the victorious 1945 election campaign, and the critical nationalisation programme that followed.

He was, however, a staunch opponent to Aneurin Bevan's proposals for the British National Health Service.

He developed his social views from his work in local politics, and always emphasised the importance of public works to deal with unemployment. He died in 1965.
