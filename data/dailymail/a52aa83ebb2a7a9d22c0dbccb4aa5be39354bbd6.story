You might think that by avoiding the rollercoasters and haunted houses at theme parks you were satisfying some sense of self-preservation. 

But a new report suggests that even the tame rides you might not be safe.

Two visitors to Disney World in Florida died late last year after going on the gentler rides in the Magic Kingdom, according to a state report published yesterday.

Dangers: Two visitors to Disney World in Florida died late last year after going on the gentler rides in the Magic Kingdom, according to a report by Florida's Bureau of Fair Rides published yesterday

A 22-year-old woman lost consciousness riding the It's A Small World water ride on Christmas Day, while a 54-year-old woman lost consciousnes after riding Toy Story Midway Mania at Disney's Hollywood Studios in October.

Both women later died, reports the Orlando Sentinel.

Jerry Aldrich, an theme-park consultant who has helped Disney with safety issues, told the paper that the slow speeds of the child-friendly rides make it unlikely they contributed to the deaths of the women.

'That's just where they happened to be at the time,' he said. 'In A Small World, I wouldn't think that would cause you a spike in blood pressure or anything like that.'

Disney told the Sentinel the rides were operating normally at the time of the incidents, which were revealed in the latest report published by Florida's Bureau of Fair Rides.

The agency releases reports of injuries linked to major theme parks' rides every quarter, reported by the theme parks themselves to the state as part of a deal which exempts them from public regulation.

Disney reported nine further incidents; Universal Orlando reported five incidents; and SeaWorld reported two incidents.

The report comes as a measles outbreak traced to Disney theme parks in California led to warnings against visiting if tourists or their children have not been vaccinated against the highly contagious respiratory disease.

New infections linked to the theme parks emerged Wednesday in an outbreak that has spread to five U.S. states and Mexico, though the vast majority - 62 - occurred in California.

People who have not received the measles-mumps-rubella, or MMR, vaccine are susceptible to contracting the highly contagious illness and should avoid Disney 'for the time being,' state epidemiologist Gil Chavez said.

The same holds true for crowded places with a high concentration of international travelers, such as airports, Chavez said. People who are vaccinated don't need to take such precautions, he said.

Disneyland Resorts spokeswoman Suzi Brown said officials agreed with the advice that 'it's absolutely safe to visit if you're vaccinated.'
