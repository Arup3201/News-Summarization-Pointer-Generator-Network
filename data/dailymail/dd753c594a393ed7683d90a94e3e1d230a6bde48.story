Tim Sherwood launched an extraordinary attack on his players and the club after their 4-0 defeat against Chelsea on Saturday night.

In an emotional post-match interview following his side’s capitulation against their London rivals, Sherwood hit out at a lack of characters in the Spurs dressing room, claimed there are players he ‘couldn’t count on’ and urged the club’s hierarchy to ‘wake up’ in their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League.

‘There is a lack of character and, too many who are too nice to each other’, a furious Sherwood said after Samuel Eto’o, Eden Hazard and two goals from Demba Ba saw Chelsea run riot against their capital neighbours.

Speaking to Sky Sports, Sherwood added: ‘You can't always be someone's mate all the time.

‘It hurts me. We need to show more guts and the players have to drag it out of each other.

‘I ain't going to forget about this 
by the time we get to the motorway. Some might. There's a few [players] I
 would count on and there's a few I wouldn't.

‘We are miles away from the top four 
unless we beat the top teams. There's been too many blips and we can't 
rely on rolling smaller teams over.

‘People and the club think we will finish top four… wake up.'

Sherwood's future as manager is in no way secure especially seeing as Louis van Gaal, the current Holland manager, has confirmed he will leave that position at the end of the season.

Asked about Younes Kaboul's sending off which led to the second goal, Sherwood said: 'It’s not a penalty. And it’s not a sending off, but the
game’s finished after that.

'The fans were fantastic here for us,' he said. 'We let them down again on the big occasion. We're not going to finish top four if we can't beat the top teams. It ain't going to happen. Miles away - unless you beat the top teams.

'Alright we beat Man United, beat Everton who are in and teams
around us. But you’re reliant on rolling over, with respect, the smaller teams
and it can’t always happen like that.'
