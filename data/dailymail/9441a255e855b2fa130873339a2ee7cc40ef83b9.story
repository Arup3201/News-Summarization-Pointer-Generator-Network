Three young men have been killed after the car they were in collided with a parked lorry.

The crash happened just before 10.30pm on Friday when a silver Citroen Saxo hit a 44-tonne lorry at the West Wiltshire Trading Estate in Westbury, Wiltshire.

This afternoon it was reported that the occupants of the car may have been on their way to a nearby nightclub when the tragedy happened.

A spokesman for Wiltshire Police today confirmed the men were all young, but declined to reveal their identities or ages at this stage of the investigation.

Their families have been informed and formal identification is due to take place on Monday.

The blue articulated lorry was parked at the side of the road at the time of the smash. 

The men travelling in the car suffered multiple injuries and were pronounced dead at the scene. Their bodies had to be cut free by firefighters who were called to the scene by the police.

The dead men were understood to have later been removed to the mortuary at the Royal United Hospital in Bath, where post mortem examinations will be carried out early next week by a pathologist to establish the exact causes of their deaths. 

Today a man working for a local taxi firm in the area said he believed the men were on their way to the popular Club Ice nightclub. 

He said: 'I heard that the boys were on their way (to the nightclub). I think they were from the Westbury area but I haven't heard any mention of their names.

'It must be devastating for the families.'

The blue articulated lorry was parked in a lay-by off the side of the road at the West Wiltshire Trading Estate in Westbury.

Quartermaster Road, which leads to the nightclub, was closed overnight while emergency services worked at the scene and Wiltshire Police today launched an investigation.

South West Ambulance Service confirmed that a total of seven vehicles attended the scene including three rapid response units, two ambulances, an officer and a doctor.

A spokesperson from the South West Ambulance Service said: 'We were called at 10.34pm to a report of three young adult males involved in a collision who were confirmed deceased at the scene. No-one was taken to hospital.

'We would like to offer our sincere condolences to the victim's families.' 

Fire crews were also called to the incident. Posting on Twitter, Trowbridge Fire Station said: 'I'm sorry to tell you that three people died when their car was involved in an RTC with a parked HGV. Pump attended with Westbury crew.

'I am very proud of everyone involved in what was an extremely difficult and complicated incident. I pray for the families of those lost.'

Neighbouring businesses today said they were unaware of the smash but praised police for doing an 'excellent job' in clearing the road back to normal.

After received information from other drivers who were at the scene at the time of the collision, Wiltshire Police said that the manner of driving of the Citroen car would form part of their investigation into the cause of the tragic crash.

It is the third fatal smash in Wiltshire in less than a month. On November 15 passenger Max Lewis (pictured), aged 19, died in a collision between a car and a van near Melksham 

A spokesman declined to comment on rumours that the car had been travelling too fast for the conditions or that it was being driven "inappropriately." 

He also said that police were trying to discover whether the young men had been heading towards Club Ice nightclub or whether they had been on the trading estate for a different reason. 

It is the third fatal smash in Wiltshire in less than a month. On November 15 passenger Max Lewis, aged 19, died in a collision between a car and a van near Melksham, while a week later, 21-year-old Max Pearson was killed when his car hit a tree in the Savernake Forest near Marlborough.
