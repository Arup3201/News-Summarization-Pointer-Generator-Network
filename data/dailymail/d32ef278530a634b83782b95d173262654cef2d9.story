A creative make-up artist has brought some of the world’s most famous works of art to life – by literally painting them onto human faces.

Rather than using oil and canvas, Valeriya Kutsan recreated iconic works by top artists Leonardo da Vinci, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Piet Mondrian with face paint and make-up.

Through the clever use of bold colours and outlines, her creations appear to be two-dimensional.

Masterpiece to make-up: Creative make-up artist Valeriya Kutsan has recreated some of the world's most famous works of art, literally painting them onto models' faces

She created the designs by using bold colours to give the impression of bright paint on a canvas and outlined edges in thick black pen like a cartoon.

One model's skin was covered in small red dots and her hair was painted with a canary yellow colour to look like one of Lichtenstein's comics.

Time-consuming process: To complete each photograph, up to four hours was spent on make-up and up to five days in post-production

Canvas of a different kind: The make-up artist researched various images and spent up to four hours painting each model including this one (right), painted to recreate Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa (left)

Others were covered in newspaper cuttings, lashings of watery paint and brush strokes to make them appear like 2D pictures.

Ms Valeriya began by researching the images and then spent up to four hours painting each model.

The stunning series of images are called ‘2D or not 2D’ and were taken by photographer Alexander Khoklov from Moscow.

Mr Khoklov, 31, said: ‘It was Valeriya's dream to make the project in the style of pop-art.

‘Valeriya decided to use different techniques of make-up to create our own posters with model faces so even the Mona Lisa in our project is digitalized and looks modern.

‘First of all we began the shoot inspired by pop-art and Andy Warhol pictures, and after that we found a lot of creative pictures, images, sketches and patterns.

‘We worked with classical images of Roy Lichtenstein, Piet Mondrian and even Leonardo DaVinci.

Devil in the detail: Each photograph took three steps according to photographer Alexander Khoklov - choosing the image, doing the make-up and transforming it in post-production

‘We also used the images of modern artists - for example the mask face is inspired by the imagery of Tom Lane.

‘There were three steps for each image, picture choosing, make-up and post-production.

‘It was a long process and took about two to four hours for each models' make-up and up to five days of post-production to make the pictures perfect.’
