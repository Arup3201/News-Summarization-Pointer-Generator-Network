Joanna Audoire suffered horrific burns to her leg after spilling a cup of McDonald's tea that she claims the lid had not been fitted properly on

A McDonald's customer suffered horrific burns after spilling a cup of tea that she claims the lid had not been fitted properly on. 

Joanna Audoire says as she sat down in her car with a tray containing the tea, the beverage toppled over covering her leg in boiling water.

The 44-year-old mother-of-three is now considering suing the fast food restaurant after medics told her she would be scarred for life.

Ms Audoire picked up a breakfast, a cup of tea, and a Coke from McDonald's to enjoy in her car after a shopping trip with a friend.

She claimed that as she sat down the cup with the poorly fitted lid pitched over. 

When she removed her trousers she claims the skin on her left thigh peeled off too, leaving her with a huge bubbling L-shaped burn the size of her hand.

The telemarketing worker was off work for more than a week because she couldn't walk properly due to the pain.

Ms Audoire, from Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, said: 'I am seriously considering legal action for the time I have had to take off work and for the injury and trauma I have suffered.

'I was in immense pain. They need to take some responsibility for serving the tea as hot as that with a flimsy lid.

'When will they improve it? When a child is seriously burnt? It makes me cross.

'The lid couldn't have been on properly, and I know tea is hot, but was it too hot on this occasion? I think it was. It was very very painful. It shouldn't have happened.'

Divorced Ms Audoire was shopping with a friend in Waltham Abbey, Essex, when they picked up food and drinks from the McDonald's nearby.

She said she was sat in the passenger seat when she realised the Coke - which was in a cardboard holder with the tea - was about to topple, so she reached to grab it.

A spokesman for McDonald's said they had launched an investigation into Ms Audoire's (pictured left) claims  and were treating the incident 'seriously'

The hot drink lid slid off and half a cup of tea covered her legs, she claims.

'I jumped out the car and was hopping around. At the time I had no idea the damage that had been caused,' she said.

'I got to work and I pulled my trousers down to go to the loo and it was horrible - the skin came off too.

'I got to the walk in centre and they treated it. They said it will probably scar.'

A few days later a nurse applied ointment and the skin has now started to bubble, leaving Ms Audoire with huge bubbles of puss covering her leg.'

A spokesman for McDonald's said: 'We regret to hear that Ms Audoire sustained an injury following her visit to our restaurant. The safety and wellbeing of our customers and employees is our first priority and all of our restaurant crew are trained to serve hot drinks in a safe manner.'

'We are treating this incident very seriously and following Ms Audoire's recent contact with our Customer Services Department, we have launched a full investigation in to this matter. We continue to encourage an open dialogue with Ms Audoire regarding this matter.'
