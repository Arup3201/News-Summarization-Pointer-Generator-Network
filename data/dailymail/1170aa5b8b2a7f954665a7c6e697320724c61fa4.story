These pictures of Boris Nemtsov chatting on his mobile phone at a radio station are believed to be the last images of him before he was shot dead in a 'contract hit'.

The 55-year-old former deputy prime minister was gunned down on a Moscow bridge on Friday in a 'politically motivated' attack which has sparked outrage and public mourning.

The pictures show Mr Nemtsov talking animatedly on his mobile phone ahead of a radio interview to promote an anti-Kremlin rally, just hours before he was killed.

The images of Mr Nemtsov at Ekho Moskvy radio station are believed to be the last before he was killed

Footage emerged last night showing the killing, with a person jumping into a car and driving off 

He can be seen sitting in the studio of Ekho Moskvy - the Echo of Moscow - an alternative Russian station which has been criticised by the Kremlin in the past.

He had been invited on to the talk show to discuss the latest opposition march he had organised, which was due to go ahead today but will now be used to protest his death. 

The station has previously been reprimanded by the Russian authorities for accounts of the conflict in Ukraine which were deemed to have contained 'information justifying war crimes'. 

The images were taken on the day Mr Nemtsov was shot dead after taking his Ukrainian model girlfriend Anna Duritskaya to dinner.

Dramatic footage of the killing surfaced last night, with Russian media reports claiming the killer emerged on foot after loitering on the Great Moskvoretsky Bridge waiting for Mr Nemtsov.

The clip appears to show the killer appear as Mr Nemtsov and Miss Duritskaya walk along the bridge which overlooks St Basil's Cathedral.

The alleged attacker is then getting into a passing car, driving off shortly before midnight.

Critics have attributed blame for the murder to the Russian President, claiming his government feared that an incriminating report Mr Nemtsov had been working on would be made public. 

The findings are said to present evidence linking Putin's regime to the Ukrainian crisis which has seen thousands slaughtered.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko fingered the Russian leader as the culprit of Mr Nemtsov's death, with mourners at the scene where he was shot also alluding to his murder as having been politically engineered.

Opposition supporters will march through Moscow today, passing the spot where the politician was killed.

The procession follows yesterday's protests which saw hundreds of mourners lay flowers and hold up signs reading 'we are all Nemtsov' - a reference to the Je Suis Charlie movement following the terrorist attacks in Paris in January.

In the days before his death, Mr Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister, said he feared being killed by the Russian leader.   

'I'm afraid Putin will kill me. I believe that he was the one who unleashed the war in the Ukraine. I couldn't dislike him more,' he said in an interview with Russia's Sobesednik news website. 

The white car (pictured) that carried the assassins has reportedly been found by police not far from where the leader was murdered. Footage released on Sunday suggested his shooter may have been on foot and driven away after the killing

The father-of-four was shot four times by assailants previously reported as having been in a white car as he walked across a bridge over the Moskva River

More than 20,000 protesters marched through Moscow in a mass demonstration against the killing of Boris Nemtsov, organisers said

Dozens of protesters with Ukrainian flags also gathered outside the Russian Embassy in London to voice their anger at Mr Nemtsov's death

He also revealed his 86-year-old mother's fears that he was be assassinated because of his outspoken views.

'"When will you stop cursing Putin? He'll kill you for that." She was completely serious,' he added. 

She received a telegram from the Russian president which described her son's murder as 'vile and cynical'. 

'We will do everything to ensure that the perpetrators of this vile and cynical crime and those who stand behind them are properly punished,' it said. 

'Please accept my deepest condolences in connection with this irreparable loss. I sincerely share your sorrow.

'Boris Nemtsov has left his mark in the history of Russia, in its political and public life. He occupied significant posts in a difficult time of transition in this country. He always openly and honestly voiced and upheld his views.'

He has now assumed 'personal control' of the investigation and his spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the shooting could be a 'provocation' for the planned protest rally. 

Russia's Investigative Committee said it was following several lines of inquiry including the possibility someone from Mr Nemtsov's own party had carried out the killing in order to raise support for a forthcoming anti-government rally. 

Investigators also said the 'meticulously planned' assassination  may also have possible links to Ukraine events as well as Islamist extremist attacks.

Earlier today around 20,000 marched through Moscow to protest at Mr Nemtsov's death.

The huge crowd waved Russian and Ukrainian flags as they held up banners which read: 'I am not afraid.'

Meanwhile dozens, including the widow of murdered Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, gathered outside the Russian Embassy in London to voice their anger at the Putin government. 

Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was shot dead in Moscow at the age of 55

Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was shot dead in Moscow at the age of 55.

His 87-year-old mother Dina had a premonition that her son would be killed, according to the politician.

He told earlier this month how his mother warned him: 'When will you stop cursing Putin? He'll kill you for that.' 

Nemtsov studied physics at State University of Gorky and earned a PhD in Physics and Mathematics.

In the wake of the Chernobyl disaster, Nemtsov organised a protest movement in his hometown, which prevented the construction of a new nuclear power plant in the region. 

The liberal reformer rose to prominence under Boris Yeltsin and became a fierce critic of Vladimir Putin.

Nemtsov first gained an international profile after being spotted by former British premier Margaret Thatcher as a future leader of Russia.

She praised his market reforms after visiting Nizhny Novgorod where as governor in the early 1990s he led spearheaded reforms.

The father-of-four, 55, was Deputy Prime Minister of Russia from 1997 to 1998 during Boris Yeltsin's presidency.

He was sentenced to 15 days in jail in January 2011 after being arrested at a New Year's Eve protest rally for 'disobedience towards police'. 

The politician founded a number of opposition movements after leaving the Russian parliament in 2003 and he had served as the co-chair of the opposition Republican Party of Russia - People's Freedom Party since 2012.

He was a prominent and vocal critic of Mr Putin and wrote a number of reports in recent years linking Putin and his inner circle to corruption.

It has been reported that Nemtsov angered Putin's government two years ago when he charged that billions of dollars had been stolen from funds designated for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, his hometown.

He has written more than 60 academic publications about quantum physics, thermodynamics and acoustics and  designed n of antennas for space apparatuses.

Jewish advocacy website AJC named Nemtsov as one of the most prominent Jews in Russia thanks to his mother's heritage. 

In his 1997 memoir, The Provincial Man, Nemtsov revealed that he was baptised Russian Orthodox in secret.

He leaves behind his wife Raisa Akhmetovna and four children.
