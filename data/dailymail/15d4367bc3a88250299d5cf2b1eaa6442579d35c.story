Tottenham have been warned they could face the nightmare prospect of a move to their proposed new ground shelved until 2020.

Chairman Daniel Levy has secured a compulsory purchase order on the land surrounding White Hart Lane, but the last remaining tenant has been given leave to appeal to the High Court.

The decision forced Spurs to admit this week that they were ‘highly unlikely’ to move into a new stadium for the start of the 2017-18 season.

Tottenham Hotspur have revealed it's 'highly unlikely' they will move into their new stadium in 2017

Olympic Stadium

Capacity: 60,000. Distance from White Hart Lane: 4.95 miles.

Likelihood: It fits the bill, but Spurs’ rivals West Ham, who will move into the stadium in 2016, would oppose the idea.

Capcity: 30,500. Distance from White Hart Lane: 40.05 miles.

Likelihood: The capacity isn’t much smaller than the 36,240-seat White Hart Lane, but the distance between the grounds is even greater than that travelled by Coventry fans to see their team play in Northampton last season . . . and that went down very badly.

However legal experts believe the delays could be even longer and that Spurs could find themselves tied up legally for another four years if the case goes all the way to the European courts.

In addition to resolving the dispute, it is expected the new 56,250-capacity stadium will take two years to complete once construction work begins, meaning the club won’t be able to move until the 2020-21 season.

Spurs have been wrangling with a local business for seven years over the final piece of land on the stadium site before work can start at White Hart Lane.

Archway Sheet Metal Works, which is run by the Josif family, are refusing to leave until they are given adequate compensation for the inconvenience of relocating.

Jay Das, a planning and compulsory purchase expert at law firm Wedlake Bell explained: ‘Spurs face the prospect of an appeal to the High Court and Archway could appeal that decision too. This whole process could take up to two years in a worse case scenario. 

Tottenham Hotspur will have to play away from White Hart Lane for one season

Fulham and QPR: The west London clubs shared Loftus Road for two season between 2002 and 2004 while Craven Cottage was being redeveloped.

Crystal Palace/Charlton/Wimbledon: Crystal Palace shared Selhurst Park with Charlton between 1985 and 1991 before playing hosts to Wimbledon until their extinction in 2003

AC Milan and Inter: Both called the San Siro home since 1947 in a move that his little impact on the success of either club and the two Milan teams have acquired almost 100 major titles between them.

‘Archway may even decide to pursue the European Courts, which would bring another two year delay. This all means the club may not be able to begin stadium construction for another four years.

‘In 99 per cent of these types of cases a deal is agreed between the two parties. 

'It seems inevitable Spurs will have to do a deal with Archway if it wants to avoid these delays. 

'The question is how much will it take to reach an agreement?’

As well as holding back the construction of the new stadium, legal experts estimate Spurs’ legal bills are likely to exceed £1million before the issue has been settled.
