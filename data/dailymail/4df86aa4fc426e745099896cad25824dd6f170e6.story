Speaking to Bleacher Report, Inglethorpe said: 'The relationship between ourselves and Melwood is still really strong. 

'We have daily communication around which players will train with the first team, and we do our best to mirror their schedule so we are able to accommodate any last-minute changes of plan.

'I speak with our manager regularly on players and philosophy. He is quite unique in that he knows the names of all the scholars in our system, and often asks how certain individuals are progressing. The first-team staff are equally supportive with the Academy. 

'John Achterberg, Mike Marsh and Colin Pascoe are all frequent visitors to games at the Academy. You will often find them all watching any game from the formative age groups right the way through to the 21s. Their expertise and opinion is both valuable to staff and inspirational to the younger players.'
