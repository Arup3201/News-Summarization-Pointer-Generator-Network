Tottenham have announced their double-winning left-back Ron Henry has died aged 80.

The former Spurs and England defender won the league and FA Cup double with the Premier League side in 1961 plus the FA Cup in 1962 and the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1963.

Henry made one appearance for England in February 1963 - in a European Championship qualifier against France in Paris - and went on to make 247 league games for Tottenham, scoring one goal.
