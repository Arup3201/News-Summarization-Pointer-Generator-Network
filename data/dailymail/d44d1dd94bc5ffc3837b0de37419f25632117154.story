The efforts by the current Chancellor, George Osborne, and the Coalition to regain control of the public finances looks to be working

Britain is on track to deliver the biggest turnaround in public finances by any advanced economy since the Second World War, according to a report.

The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says that if current policy remains in place the public finances will return to balance by 2018-19 – producing the first surplus for 18 years.

‘It would represent one of the largest budget reductions among advanced countries in the post-war period,’ says its report.

The OBR seeks to shed light on the causes and consequences of the build-up of deficit and debt in Britain since the financial crisis of 2007-2008.

It heaped blame for hefty budget deficits on reckless spending by Labour in the period that Gordon Brown was Prime Minister and Alistair Darling was Chancellor.

It says the lavish spending plans announced by Labour in the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review were adhered to despite the onset of the banking crisis, which was heralded by the collapse of Northern Rock in 2007 and the subsequent failure of Lehman Brothers in 2008.

Indeed, Labour actually advanced some capital spending plans – not due to take place until 2010-2011 – to the year before. It also spent heavily on employment support at a time when tax receipts were plummeting because of the depth of the recession.

The efforts by the current Chancellor, George Osborne, and the Coalition to regain control of the public finances looks to be working even though returning to the black has been delayed.

Most significantly perhaps, the Tory-led government has taken an axe to the public sector, reducing spending to 38 per cent of the nation’s output.

That is a figure not seen since the early 2000s, when Labour abandoned the spending ceilings inherited from the Tories and embarked on a spending free-for- all. The improvement in finances has largely been achieved by cutting the spending of Whitehall departments, which ballooned in the latter years of the Labour government.

There have also been sharp cutbacks in capital spending and the welfare budget also has been brought back under control.

Contrary to public perceptions spending on the National Health Service has continued to expand against the background of deep reductions in the annual spending of departments.

Budgetary woes were increased as a result of the financial crisis. As the economy plunged into recession and output plummeted so did the income the government received from taxes.

Cash receipts and nominal GDP (the output of the economy without adjustment for inflation) both fell in real terms in the years 2007-08 and 2009-10 – ‘a rare event’ says the OBR.

Robert Chote, the OBR’s director, described the surge in spending by Labour, at a time of worsening public finances, as ‘unusual’.

He noted that other countries ‘were trying to pre-fund the rising costs of ageing by getting the debt down in good times’.

As a result of Labour’s reckless spending patterns UK national debt climbed by 2.5 per cent of national output a year between 2004 and 2007, a faster rate than Greece, Portugal and Italy – the currently very sick eurozone countries.

The OBR warns that the biggest risk to a return to health in the public finances is that the current government or a future one adopts different policies and abandons commitments to keep spending on a tight rein.
