Four lingerie-clad women drew on their bodies with Sharpie markers to highlight their physical shortcomings - like a plastic surgeon during a consultation - for a powerful photo series that ridicules the media's depiction of female bodies.

Sarah Coffman from San Diego, California, enlisted three friends, whom she refers to as Tiffany Stevens, Rose Lee and Ashley A, for the provocative photoshoot, which was shot by photographer Terrance Smalls. The images from the aptly-named Lines Series show the women reading magazine featuring models and actresses while they sit in a doctor's office waiting room covered in marker.

'We live in a society where women are constantly being stripped down and evaluated, without physically being stripped down,' Terrance explained on his website. 

Powerful message: Sarah Coffman (center) stood up while Tiffany Stevens(left) and Rose Lee (right) pointed out her flaws in the provocative photo series shot by Terrance Smalls

Media pressure: The three women read the popular men's magazine Maxim, famous for featuring scantily-clad women on its cover, while they sit in a waiting room in their underwear

Dream girls: The trio, who used Sharpie markers to highlight their physical flaws, pointed and stared at the models in Vogue 

He continued: 'Well, what does it look like when we actually strip women down and evaluate their physical "shortcomings"? How insane does it look? How uncomfortable does it make us feel? The purpose of this series was to find out.'

Sarah, Tiffany and Rose wore patterned bras and underwear and donned coiffed hair and a faces full of make-up for the series, which puts a bold spin on pin-up inspired photoshoots.

Terrance explained that their over-the-top beauty looks were a 'conscious decision' that they made to further drive their point across.

'Yes, the ladies are wearing a lot of makeup (more than they would if they were just going out) and yes, the images have been retouched,' he noted.

Mean girls: Sarah and Rose sneered at Tara, who was sitting between them and obliviously reading Maxim

Meanwhile, Ashley sported a more business oriented look and posed in a camisole and a pencil skirt before she shed her clothes and exposed the markings on her body.

All of the women had lines and arrows drawn over their breasts, on areas of their stomachs and around their arms and thighs, highlighting what many might perceive to be their ‘problem’ areas.

While the series was created last August, Sarah, 23, who goes by the name ‘nerdygypsy’ online, shared the images on Reddit yesterday, writing: 'So my friends and I put on a photoshoot a few months back, this became the result.'

She continued: 'We were trying to more or less expose the ridiculousness involved in photoshoots.' 

Touch up: Terrance explained that it was a 'conscious decision' for the models to wear more make-up than they do in real life

Baring all: Rose wore a hot pink bra and a black thong with pink bows during the photoshoot

Eye contact: Rose put her hands on her hips as she looked over her shoulder at the camera and flaunted her derriere 

Strike a pose: The photo series proves that women are insecure about their bodies no matter what the size because of how the media portrays female bodies 

The girls can be seen measuring each other's waists, pointing out their flaws with their fingers, staring at their bodies in the mirror and pouring over men's magazines in the images that aim to start a discussion about body image.

When Terrance first posted some of the images to is Instagram account in 2014, he received an overwhelmingly positive response from his followers. 

'That's what true beauty is. Not afraid to be and show urself for who u really are. Spite what other people say or think of you [sic],' one person wrote, while another commented: 'Great message.'
