This powerful set of close-up photos captures the moment that yet another bloody clash broke out between warring sides in Ukraine, as the ongoing conflict reached new levels.

The photos were taken during the latest assault in the strife-torn separatist east, outside the industrial city of Lugansk, amid fears that the crisis is being propelled into a full-scale war.

The confrontation ended with five rebels being killed as Ukraine forces warded off an attack by 500 pro-Russian gunmen on a federal border guard camp.

Vladislav Seleznyov, press secretary for Ukraine's operation against the rebels in the east, described the base as an important coordinating node for the border guards, and said the attack may have been an attempt to disrupt communications.

Seleznyov also spoke of the separate rebel attack on Monday on a government checkpoint in Slovyansk, a city in the Donetsk region that has been an epicenter of the pro-Russian movement.

Many in Ukraine's east are suspicious of the new pro-Western government in Kiev, which came to power when pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych fled the country in February after months of street protests in Kiev.

Protests in the east demanding greater independence from the Ukrainian capital soon turned into a separatist movement as the Luhansk and Donetsk regions declared independence following hastily called referendums.

The conflict between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian insurgents escalated markedly in the past week, with rebels attempting to seize a major airport and the shooting-down of a Ukrainian military helicopter.

In Moscow, the Russian Defense Ministry announced Monday a military exercise involving the launch of high-precision missiles.

The ministry said the maneuvers of the western military district will continue through Thursday and will involve the deployment of Iskander surface-to-surface missiles.

Moscow didn't specify the areas where the exercise will be held and made no mention of the situation in Ukraine.
