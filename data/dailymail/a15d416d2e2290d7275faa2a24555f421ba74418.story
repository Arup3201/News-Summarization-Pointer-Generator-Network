Alan Shearer insists that Newcastle were so embarrassing last season that he couldn't even give away tickets for his box at St James' Park.

There was a real frustration at the Magpies' finish to the 2013/2014 season as the club suffered a six-game losing streak.

Newcastle have signed seven new players this summer and there are high hopes that they can banish the bad memories of last season.

The Match of the Day pundit wants to avoid a repeat scenario of an empty box at St James' this campaign, as his former club look to secure another top 10 finish in the Premier League.

Shearer told The Mirror: 'For the first time last year in our box, which I share with another nine guys, there was a game where we couldn't give a ticket away.

'There were only three or four who wanted to go. I hope that doesn't happen again this season.'
