Scrum-half Ben Youngs has warned that England must be much more clinical next weekend against a France side capable of upsetting the party at Twickenham.

Youngs was upbeat but also in realistic mood after Stuart Lancaster’s men defeated Scotland, acknowledging that England blew several chances in the first half.

England had trailed 13-10 at the break so captain Chris Robshaw looked more relieved than anything else at the end as he raised the Calcutta Cup to cheers of approval from supporters. Those fans had certainly seemed worried when half-a-dozen first-half chances had gone begging.

Lancaster’s men should have had a far better points tally but had two tries wiped out for forward passes. They also failed to finish off promising moves due to poor decision-making and last-gasp Scottish tackling.

Leicester star Youngs said: ‘It was a crucial win and puts us in with a great chance of the title but we have to do the business against France here at Twickenham next Saturday.

‘We beat ourselves up a little bit and you can’t do that in Test rugby. We are disappointed we left a few tries and points out there.

‘To have so much of the ball, put them under so much pressure and go in at half-time losing was a real blow. We had a few words in the changing room and made sure we put things right.

‘Scotland are a very good team but we should have been more clinical in the first half.’

Jack Nowell scored England's late try which put them top of the standings on points difference

Exeter wing Jack Nowell, whose late try ensured England went top of the Six Nations table, said: ‘I’ve not played in an England team where we created so many chances but let them slip by.

‘But the win has given us a real chance of getting our hands on the title. Now we have to get up for France — an even harder match. They’ll come to Twickenham with nothing to lose.

‘I was delighted to get that try at the end. I’d had a few openings during the game but for one reason or another the try did not come. So it was something of a relief at the end there.’

Scotland captain Greig Laidlaw admitted: ‘We had our chance when we led at half-time. After that we did not defend so well and England began to make us pay.

‘It’s another disappointing defeat but the lads will try to finish the tournament with a win over Ireland.’
