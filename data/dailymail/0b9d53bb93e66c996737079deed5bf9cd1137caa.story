A 19-year-old man from Gawler has been captured on camera racially attacking innocent Hungry Jacks staff and refusing their service at an Adelaide store.

The incident was filmed by a customer in the Rundle St. store on Friday at 5.10 pm and shows a man dressed in jeans and a black T-shirt attempting to place an order at the counter.

The man tells staff, 'I want it made by a white person,' and then refuses service.

The 19-year-old can be seen abusing staff, calling them 'disgusting' and refusing their service

Another Hungry Jacks customer can be heard asking the man 'what's wrong with a Chinese guy making your burger?', to which the man says 'everything, you don't belong here'.

The man then abuses a female staff member after she asks him to leave.

He can be heard saying 'at least I'm born here c---, where do you come from, f---ing Africa or Asia? Disgusting.'

The tirade is brought to an end when another customer grabs the man and physically removes him from the shop whilst saying 'We are all f---ing Australian.'

Another customer ends the tirade by physically grabbing the man and removing him from the store

The man hangs around after being thrown out and is arrested by police a short distance away

After being removed from the store, the man continues his outburst by yelling at the customer, 'wait until I come back with the Rebels (Motorcycle Club) you f---ing idiot.' 

Police were called shortly after the incident took place and given a description of the man by other customers.

The man was arrested a short distance away and charged with disorderly behaviour.

He has been bailed and will appear in Adelaide Magistrate Court on the 26th of March.
