It may have always been on his mind, but country singer Willie Nelson only recently announced he plans to create and sell his own brand of marijuana. 

The singer's personal brand of weed will be called Willie's Reserve and it could be available as soon as 2016.

Nelson, 81, revealed his plans at the Heartbreaker Banquet, a fundraiser which is held during South by Southwest in Austin, Texas.

Brand will represent Nelson's 'personal morals and convictions' and be sold from 'anti-Walmart' storefronts

After Nelson let the cat out of the bag, his spokesman revealed details about Willie's Reserve to the Daily Beast.

The brand will represent Nelson's 'personal morals and convictions' and it will be sold from storefronts that feel like 'the anti-Walmart', according to Bowman. 

The plan is to open stores in states like Colorado, Washington and Alaska.

Bowman said: 'He wants it to be something that's reflective of his passion.

'Ultimately, it's his. But it was developed by his family, and their focus on environmental and social issues, and in particular this crazy war on drugs, and trying to be a bright light amongst this trail as we're trying to extract ourselves from the goo of prohibition.'

He added that growers who meet Nelson's standards for quality will have the chance to peddle their wares next to Willie's Reserve. 

Bowman said: 'Let's just call it the anti-Walmart model. 

'Personally, internally, that's what we call it. 

'A certain standard by which growers have to account for carbon and such, in a way that empowers small growers who are doing the right thing.

'It will be like when you walk into a Whole Foods store.'

Bob Marley's family capitalized on the deceased reggae legend's popularity by announcing a 'global cannabis brand' called Marley Natural, according to the Cannabist. 

The brand, which is slated to launch later this year, will 'honor the life and legacy of Bob Marley as well as his belief in the benefits of cannabis' by offering 'heirloom Jamaican cannabis strains' inspired by those the singer enjoyed.
