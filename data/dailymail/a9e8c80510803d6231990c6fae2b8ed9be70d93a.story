Thirty nine of the 40 jockeys who rode in last month's Grand National at Aintree are to face a charge over their conduct at the start.

The riders, including 19-time champion AP McCoy plus senior colleagues Richard Johnson, Barry Geraghty and Tom Scudamore, are accused to attempting to line up before requested to do so by the Official starter.

The incident under scrutiny also saw starter’s assistant Simon McNeil being knocked over.

The start of the most watched race in the British calendar once again showed racing in a poor light with the runners having to be re-called after a false start, although this is not part of the enquiry.

However, the BHA will not pursue any action against the jockeys for their subsequent ‘mutiny’ when, with many of the Irish riders needing to leave to reach connections home, they refused to co-operate with a reconvened enquiry.

Jamie Stier, Director of Raceday Operations and Regulation for BHA, said: ‘Managing the start of the Grand National and dealing with any incidents that occur during this process presents a unique challenge.

'After reviewing all the available evidence we have taken the decision not to pursue any charges relating to the fact that we were unable to complete the Stewards’ enquiry on the day.

‘This is also a reflection of the scale of the challenge in conducting an enquiry in such circumstances.

'Instead, we would like to put in place a protocol, to be developed in conjunction with the jockeys, for managing such situations where a large numbers of riders are involved.

‘Having reviewed all of the available evidence and footage into the incident prior to the start of the Grand National it is the view of BHA that 39 of the 40 riders in the race attempted to line up or take a position before being instructed to do so, which was before the off time of the race.

‘If the Disciplinary Panel finds that this is the case then this would constitute an offence under the Rules of Racing.“It is also BHA’s view that the riders then moved forward towards the start and in the process knocked down the Assistant Starter, who was positioned in front of the field, advising the riders not to line up. This will also be considered by the Disciplinary Panel.

‘This all occurred after riders in the Grand National had been briefed in advance of the race about conduct at the start, which emphasised the obligation under the Rules for the riders to obey the Starter’s instructions.

‘The Disciplinary Panel will now determine whether any of the riders in question are in breach of the Rules of Racing.

‘We acknowledge the length of time taken to reach these conclusions. By working with the jockeys to develop a protocol for dealing with such cases we would expect to avoid a similar scenario in the future.’

In response, Paul Struthers, chief executive of the Professional Jockeys Association, said his members would vigorously defend the charges.

He added: ‘We are disappointed that the BHA has decided to lay charges against the jockeys in specific relation to the start.  The decision by the BHA not to progress with charges in relation to subsequent events is entirely unsurprising given the procedural failings that followed the running of the Grand National.

‘Having reviewed the footage, read the transcript and listened to the audio recording of the inquiry and being aware of numerous other facts, we believe that the jockeys have strong grounds to contest the charges.

‘However, with so many jockeys charged we have been unable to take formal instruction at this stage and cannot therefore confirm what their collective or individual positions will be in relation to the charges.

‘It was and remains our belief that the appropriate course of action would have been a forward-looking, collegiate approach to the wider and ongoing issue of big-field jump starts.  We actively encouraged the BHA to embrace this approach and to grip this matter with more urgency than they have shown but to no avail.

‘We believe the decision to lay any charges is an opportunity lost by the BHA.  If the jockeys decide to contest the charges we trust that the BHA will allow it to be dealt with in a transparent manner and ensure the hearing is open to members of the media, even though this will inevitably lead to their officials and procedural failings being placed under the spotlight.”

The only jockey who rode in the Grand National not charged is Brendan Powell jnr, who was on board Battle Group. His antics in refusing to line up added to the confusion of the incident.If found guilty the 39 are likely to face a one-day ban.
