Pill-popper: German dictator Adolf Hitler allegedly was a manic depressive with Parkinson¿s, had deformed genitals, had no libido and devoured a cocktail of drugs

Adolf Hitler was a drug-abusing hypochondriac with deformed genitals who regularly consumed a cocktail of amphetamines, bull semen, rat poison and morphine when he sent millions of innocent people to their death.

That's according to a new explosive TV documentary based on recently-discovered records and letters from the Nazi leader's obese personal physician, Dr Theodore Morell.

In a desperate attempt to show his followers he was the epitome of male virility, the 5ft 8ins German leader downed more than 80 different drugs each day - a shocking habit that some psychiatrists and 
historians believe turned an  egomaniac into a sadistic mass murderer.

According to National Geographic's Nazi Underworld - Hitler's Drug Use Revealed, psychiatrist Professor Nassir Ghaemi claims Hitler's drug abuse exacerbated his manic depression, reducing him to a feeble, trembling figure.

'It’s not whether
 Hitler was an amphetamine addict or not – it’s that Hitler had bipolar 
disorder and amphetamines made it worse,' he said.

'That
 is the issue. That has never been described before and that would 
explain a lot why Hitler changed in the late 1930s and the 1940s.'

According to the Irish Mirror, a series of letters and medical reports on Hitler commissioned by the U.S. military after the war were released in America, among them interviews with the Fuhrer's six doctors including Morell.

The 47-page classified report stated Hitler had chronic eczema, persistent stomach cramps and appalling flatulence.

No-one was able to cure the leader's afflictions - until Morell prescribed live bacteria which eased the cramps.

A delighted Hitler made Morell his personal physician for nine years, even though his aides called the 'Reichsmaster of injections' a 'quack', 'phony' and 'charlatan'.

The
 reports show Hitler snorted powdered cocaine to 'clear his sinuses
 and soothe his throat' and used eye-drops infused with 10 per cent cocaine.

His dosage was lowered when he began to 'crave' the illicit drug.

In his drug cabinet, the controversial doctor kept gun-cleaning oil which had been banned from human consumption and 
flatulence pills made from rat poison.

Morell's methods were so controversial, other doctors believed he was a 'double agent' trying to poison Hitler who was experiencing 'rapid double cycling'.

'Some of his American interrogators 
wondered whether he was a double agent, trying to make Hitler so 
dysfunctional that he couldn’t win, couldn’t achieve what he wanted,' Ghaemi said.

The report also state Morell injected Hitler with extracts from the 
prostate glands or ground testicles of young bulls to boost his libido so he could keep up with his much-younger lover.

'Morell gave Hitler a 
preparation called Testoviron, a kind of testosterone preparation, 
usually before Hitler was going to spend a night with Eva Braun,' Cambridge
 University historian Richard Evans said.

'Eva
 Braun was young and much fitter. Hitler was much older, he was lazy, he 
didn’t take much exercise and I’m sure he asked Dr Morell to help 
him out before he went to bed with Braun.”

Morell’s
 notes also reveal the dictator feared cancer and was paranoid about catching the common cold.

Morell
 treated Hitler throughout the war even though other Nazi doctors 
blamed him for the dictator’s dramatic deterioration and hyperactive gabbling. 

The Irish Mirror reports the doctor confessed to administering opiates, morphine, 
barbiturates and amphetamines when he was captured by the Allies and accused of criminal 
negligence.

The revelations have led some historians to speculate whether Hitler's extreme and erratic war-mongering was influenced by his drug addiction.

However others fear the claims feed Hitler excusers and 
neo-Nazis.

'Just 48 
hours before his death Hitler dictated his will, as lucid and alert as 
ever. His mental capabilities were normal,' Hans-Joachim
 Neumann, author of Was Hitler Ill?, said.

'The Jews were not wiped out because Hitler was ill, but because 
most Germans followed his decisions. Hitler always knew what he was 
doing.'
