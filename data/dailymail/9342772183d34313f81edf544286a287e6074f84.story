A five-year-old girl shot in the head during a suspected home invasion has died three days later.

Allison Griffor was sleeping in her bed at her family’s home in Charleston, South Carolina, early on Tuesday when a bullet from a shotgun fired through the front door hit her and lodged in her brain.

Her father William had gone to the front door when he heard it being kicked, but before he could open it shots were fired through and he was also hit. His daughter was sleeping in the front room.

Allison, a pupil at Drayton Hall Elementary School, had her life support machine turned off on Thursday after doctors could not find any activity in her brain scans. Her organs have been donated.

It all began when Mr Griffor heard a loud banging on the front door and went to investigate, but as he reached for the lock there was a blast, reported WCBD. He told all the children to get under the bed.

‘I went to the room to tell the kids and wife “we’re safe” and turned on the light to find our daughter would not respond,’ he told WCBD. ‘My wife turned her and she was laying in a pool of blood.

‘The bullets had went through the door, through the wall, shooting her in the head as she lay sleeping in her safe bed… I was injured in the incident, but our daughter was critically injured.’

Mr Griffor said he was shocked by the shooting, because his ‘hard-working loving Christian’ family have no links to drugs or guns and ‘no enemies’. There have been no arrests made yet.

William and his wife Jennifer have two other children - Aiden, seven, and Lucas, two. The family released a statement early on Friday morning saying that Allison had died.

Authorities are investigating if marijuana and guns found at a nearby home are related to the incident.

The family are planning to sell a truck and boat to help fund huge medical bills since the incident, their spokesman Richard Douglas told the Charleston Post and Courier.

Some people in the local community are reportedly annoyed that it took the 911 call centre three times longer than usual to dispatch units to the scene after Mrs Griffor’s call.

‘She was a leader and an artist. She 
would sit for periods and colour with a seriousness of a doctor in 
surgery. She was an awesome sister to her two brothers and always did 
everything with them'

But a 911 centre spokesman told the Charleston Post and Courier that the system could not immediately determine the address as the call came in on a mobile phone.

‘Allison was an amazing person with silly, fun, bubbly, loving life all around her, with a passion that seems to be unrivalled by any we have ever experienced,' a family statement said in part.

‘She was a leader and an artist. She would sit for periods and colour with a seriousness of a doctor in surgery. She was an awesome sister to her two brothers and always did everything with them.'
