The married socialite who is pregnant with Simon Cowell’s baby cheated on her husband because ‘cuddling up to five Gucci bags’ at night did not satisfy her longing for a man.

Lauren Silverman, who has enjoyed holidays on Cowell's yacht - sometimes with her husband and sometimes just with the X-Factor creator, lived a life of luxury that was empty without her husband Andrew around because he was often away on business, the man who raised her has claimed.

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, Stewart Eisenberg said that Lauren slept with Cowell because she was lonely and you ‘can’t put a credit card under your arm when you go out to dinner’.

He revealed that in her youth Lauren ‘broke a lot of hearts’ and had men lining up to date her as she was ‘breathtaking’ in her beauty.

Her mother Carole also has a checkered romantic history as she lured Mr Eisenberg away from the woman he was seeing when they first met - and married her next husband ‘five minutes’ after they eventually divorced.

Mr Eisenberg, 73, was Carole’s second husband and was married to her for 20 years until they divorced in 2004.

He spoke out as Lauren, 36, and husband Andrew, 37, continued their crisis talks at their $4 million home in Bridgehampton, New York, over her infidelity.

The couple are said to be hardly talking but are staying in the same house to try to keep things normal for their seven-year-old son Adam, who has been staying there while attending a nearby summer camp.

Lauren meanwhile is 10 weeks pregnant with Cowell’s child, after having an affair which may have been going on for more than a year.

Mr Eisenberg, a real estate mogul who lives in Miami, said that Andrew’s long hours and frequent trips away from the family’s New York-based Andalex Group property company may have left Lauren feeling like a bored housewife.

She had a driver, fancy clothes, holiday homes and a lifestyle few could dream of - but no man around to dote on her.

Instead she began taking holidays with Cowell, who was a friend of the couple’s and was more than happy to have her on his yacht.

Mr Eisenberg said that for the past six summers the Silvermans and Cowell have ‘all spent time together’ - illustrating the depth of what Andrew’s brother Alexander has called ‘an unbelievable story of betrayal’.

Mr Eisenberg said: ‘I think he is smitten and overwhelmed by Lauren as she is with him. She was not too happy in her marriage and got swept away. 

‘I mean she had the money but you can't cuddle up to five Gucci bags and a credit card or take them under your arm when you go out to dinner.

‘I don't think either one intended to plant the seed, but I think they will rise to the occasion and make everything all right.’

Mr Eisenberg was full of praise for Andrew and called him a ‘bright, very intelligent man but he doesn't make random choices’.

He said: ‘Things have not been great between he and Lauren for a while.

‘She is certainly not a gold digger. That's ridiculous. She is very talented and had her own career in fashion and Andrew was very successful in real estate. She doesn't need Simon's money.’

Carole married Mr Eisenberg in 1989 having met him at the Cricket Club, a country club in Miami.

He was working out a lot and Carole ‘spotted’ him and, though he was with someone at the time, they got together because the ‘timing’ felt right.

Carole had married her first husband Steven Davis in 1973 when she was about 20, though they later split.

Keen to give her girls a stable family life, she and Mr Eisenberg settled into a $1 million home in Hallandale Beach, Florida.

Both Lauren and Nicole attended Miami Country Day School, which is private and costs $30,000 a year. It is considered one of the best schools in the state.

Lauren graduated in 1995 - a photograph from a 1993 yearbook shows her looking fresh faced but undoubtedly very beautiful.

Mr Eisenberg said that when they were together ‘everything was about family’ and they had a ‘wonderful family life’ - something Lauren is now trying to salvage for her own son.

He said: ‘Big holiday dinners, vacations. We traveled a lot and those three girls (Lauren, her mother and her sister Nicole) always turned men's heads. They were breathtaking.

‘As a teenager she and Nicole both participated in sports. They were great skiers, ski bunnies who would be on the slopes from morning till night. 

‘Yes, Lauren had a lot of suitors and she broke a lot of hearts. A lot of boys were smitten with her. It’s to be expected, she was a beautiful girl. Lauren was feisty, an over-achiever’.

Carole, now 60, worked in real estate and the family ‘always travelled in better circles’, intent on moving up in the world.

Clearly Mr Eisenberg was not enough for her and they split in 2004.

Her third marriage to Robert Saland, who she is still with, took place eight months later in December of that year.

Mr Eisenberg said that his divorce was amicable and that he still misses Carole, even today.

He said: ‘There was no cheating involved. '

‘Even though she married her next husband Robert five minutes after our divorce. Sometimes it just happens. She went through some hard times and changes and people change.’

For Lauren, however, things could not be more different.

Andrew has not only filed for divorce but taken the unusual step of naming Cowell in the documents as one of the parties.

The most explosive claims of all are in now-sealed papers in which he accused Cowell of behaving in a ‘cruel and inhuman’ manner for sleeping with his wife.

Adding to his anguish is that just how long the affair between Lauren and Cowell, 53, has been going on is still unclear.

Pictures from August last year appear to show Cowell and Lauren apparently kissing on his yacht in St Tropez.

Another photo from the same trip showed them cosying up together, next to which she wrote: ‘My lil Simey Monster’.

Friends have claimed that Andrew and Laura’s marriage had been in trouble for some time and that they had grown apart.

However, speaking to MailOnline Mzia Shiman, Lauren’s beautician who has known her for 10 years, claimed that the couple were not actually estranged.

She said: ‘She and Andrew were never separated but Andrew works long hours, he’s often not in New York.

‘She and Andrew were always invited to things together by Simon but if Andrew couldn’t go, sometime Lauren would go on her own.’

Quite how somebody like Lauren met Andrew in the first place is still not certain. Perhaps like her mother did, she ‘spotted’ him across the room at a party in New York.

Once they were married she seems to have settled into life comfortably enough - each summer for the past seven years he has paid out $150,000 to rent the seven-bedroom mansion in Bridgehampton for the season.

The property has seven bedrooms, seven bathrooms, four fireplaces, a pool and a huge kitchen.

Then there was their New York pad - a luxury apartment in Park Avenue, Manhattan, which is owned by Andrew’s father Allen, a real estate mogul who founded the family business.

Over the past few years Lauren has been pictured at a number of Hamptons society events including a Mulberry lunch she attended with Nicole, 32.

Andrew rarely figures in such pictures meaning that she would have been away from her husband while he was working 150 miles away in New York or travelling.

Since the scandal became public, both families are saying little although even though their son seemed snared by her charms, Andrew’s parents were never impressed by her.

Allen and his wife Eleonara refused to go to their wedding at the luxury St Regis hotel in 2003.

Sources have said that they ‘did not approve of who she was’ - and now their fears appear to have come true.

Friends of Andrew now seem to agree with them.

One has said: 'Andrew maybe was in a little bit of denial about this.

‘He knew Lauren had star f***ing tendancies - not literally - and that she enjoyed being around celebrities, but he had no real clue.'

As for the divorcing couple, they have both released separate statements and yesterday Andrew spoke in person for the first time and said that his family were going through a ‘very difficult time’.

Cowell, who reportedly has no intention of marrying Lauren, has said: ‘I have to respect a lot of people's feelings right now.

‘There a lot of things I will eventually clear up when the time is right, but I really have to be sensitive because there's a lot of people's feelings involved here.’
