We've barely had chance to blink since Romeo Beckham was unveiled as the face of Burberry's campaign but there is no stopping the Beckham's in their global domination of the fashion world.

Hot on the heels of her son's fashionable debut, Victoria has released a teaser video for her brand new e-commerce site.

Although the website doesn't launch until next month, the designer has whet the world's appetite with this 17 second glimpse.

The clip includes shots of models in the designer's own pieces and even features a voiceover from the Spice Girl herself.

The 38-year-old can be heard saying: 'What do people expect of me... mmm, I think people expect the best.'

The video, which is the brainchild of King & Partners who have worked with Marc Jacobs, shows models walking the catwalk in 
Victoria Beckham creations as well as images of Victoria making a speech
and applying lipstick.

The mother-of-four's new site will allow fans of her brand to buy online with the click of a mouse.

On
visiting her soon-to-be site, there are even more flickering images of 
models (including a ballet dancing Cara Delevingne) strutting and 
blowing kisses with a tagline explaining that the site is coming soon.

Speaking about her new website, Victoria said: 'My new website has been in the making for a very long time.

'It was so important that the concept, tone and look of it were true to me and my aesthetic and that the shopping experience was the very best that it could be for my customer.
