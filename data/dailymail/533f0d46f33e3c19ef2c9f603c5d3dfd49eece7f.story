For 50 years, Harry Redknapp has been one of football’s most colourful and outspoken characters. 

Now he’s written a book every fan will want to read.

In Redknapp’s new book 'A Man Walks On To a Pitch' - serialised exclusively by Sportsmail this week - the QPR manager picks his all-time team of the Seventies.

Sportsmail can exclusively reveal Harry Redknapp's greatest team from the seventies

PHIL NEAL: MAN FOR ALL SEASONS

He is still the most decorated English footballer in history, but holds a record even more fantastic than that. 

Between October 23, 1976, when he played in a 1–1 draw away at Leeds United, and September 24, 1983, a 1–0 defeat at Manchester United, Neal did not miss a single Liverpool game in any competition: a run of 417 consecutive matches! 

Phil seemed indestructible.

JOHN ROBERTSON: THE ROUGH DIAMOND

Bill Shankly said he could pass the ball with the accuracy of a snooker player potting the black, but John was on his way out at Nottingham Forest when Brian Clough and Peter Taylor arrived.

He was the most unlikely professional footballer anyone had seen. He was overweight, smoked liked a trooper and, in Clough’s words, was living out of a chip pan. Yet Clough persevered with Robertson and won two European Cups.

Giggs would have solved England's problems... he was born to play left wing 

Wenger heralded a change in English football... he introduced Prozone and scouting reports

Ravel Morrison has the class of Bale but his attitude is holding back his talent 

Vieira and Keane are warriors... they were even prepared to do battle while working on TV!

Why Redknapp fears that the English manager is in danger of becoming extinct  

Vieira nearly crossed North London to join Spurs... and  Suarez was close to signing too 

Pies in the canteen and throwing teacups at players... the Premier League killed all that!

KEVIN KEEGAN: SWEPT ALL BEFORE HIM

What a player - and what a career. Brilliant at Liverpool, brilliant in Germany with Hamburg, won the European Cup, twice European Footballer of the Year - he turned into a truly amazing player. I know he took something Bill Shankly said to heart.

‘Even if I was a roadsweeper,’ Shankly told him, ‘I’d have the cleanest street in town.’

And that was Kevin’s attitude to football.

Kevin Keegan was twice named 'European Football of the Year' and was a truly amazing player, says Redknapp
