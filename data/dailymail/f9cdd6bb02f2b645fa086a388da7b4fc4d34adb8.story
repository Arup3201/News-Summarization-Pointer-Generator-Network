An alleged drunk driver not only hit a pedestrian but sped along with the fatally wounded man on her windshield for more than 2 miles, police said.

Sherri Wilkins, 51, of Torrance, California, was arrested on suspicion of drink-driving and manslaughter charges on Saturday night.

Philip Moreno, 31, was crossing Torrance Boulevard at about 11.25pm when Wilkins drove her car into him.

Drunk: Sherri Wilkins had a blood-alcohol level twice the legal limit when she struck Philip Moreno and drove 2.3 miles with his body stuck in her windshield

She kept going with Moreno 'embedded in her windshield' for 2.3 miles before witnesses finally

Victim: Moreno was pronounced dead at the hospital

persuaded her to pull her car over near Crenshaw Boulevard and 182nd Street.

'He is literally embedded in her
hood and into the windshield,' Torrance Police Sgt. Robert Watt told the Los Angeles Daily News.

'She knew he was somehow 
embedded into her car but she panicked.'

There were no witnesses who saw Wilkins hit him but she was going so fast that Moreno was knocked out of his shoes and shorts.

Moreno was in critical condition when emergency services reached him but was aware enough to speak to officers at the scene.

He was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.

Wilkins blood alcohol was more than double the legal limit.

She told officers she was driving home from work.

Police are still searching for witnesses who saw the accident.

Freed: Police said Moreno was still able to speak to them when he was pulled from the car windshield
