Maisie as Arya in Game Of Thrones

Game Of Thrones isn't just one of the biggest shows on TV - thanks to its bloodlust and lashings of female nudity it's also one of the most controversial. And few figures are more controversial than that of Maisie Williams, who plays Arya Stark.

On screen she's a fearsome creature who, aged just 12, has already killed one man - and you can expect the murder count to tot up in the new series, which starts this week. She's been orphaned by the terrible war that sees several factions vying for the throne. In the last series' now infamous Red Wedding scene, her brother, sister-in-law and mother were all brutally murdered while attending what was meant to be a happy occasion.

But 16-year-old Maisie's attracted controversy off screen too, thanks to her decision to leave formal education before she even took her GCSEs.

But the articulate, Bristol-born daughter of a university administrator and businessman insists she didn't really have a choice.

'My school wouldn't let me go off and film so we had a polite conversation where they kind of asked me to leave,' she says when we meet. 'It's fair enough; they can't teach me if I'm not there and it's a black mark against the school to have someone who's absent. But I was working, not bunking off.'

Maisie hasn't abandoned education though, as she recently started a course in performing arts at Bath Dance College.

'They're encouraging me to work and they make it easier to slip back in. I know this is something I want to make a career out of. Game Of Thrones is just the beginning.'

The youngest of four children, Maisie had no professional acting experience when she won the part of Arya in the huge HBO production. She had hoped to make a future in dance but an agent put her forward for the role which required a tomboy-ish girl; Maisie fitted in perfectly.

The show's been a bigger hit than any of its mainly British cast could have predicted. Based on George RR Martin's series of fantasy novels, it may feature dragons, zombies and women who give birth to shadows, but even non-fantasy-loving viewers fell in love with its epic battles for power.

A huge hit around the world, it attracts 14 million viewers in the US and over 4 million here - it's Sky Atlantic's biggest show.

It's brutally gory, but Maisie says it didn't take long to get used to the blood. 'Because I'm the youngest in my family I had to watch movies I was too young for, and they were a lot scarier,' she says.

'Now I know it's pretend. The fake blood is a sugary liquid which tastes amazing. The only things I struggle to watch are torture scenes - but everyone struggles with those.'

For Maisie, who has two films, Corvidae and Falling, out this year, the hardest aspect of being a star is dealing with the fame; she's been the victim of Twitter abuse but insists she can deal with it. 'I've put myself on social media so I have to take the consequences,' she says.

'One thing that comes up is I have a wide face and big eyebrows. Everyone has their insecurities so I wear it as my armour. Instead of tweezing my eyebrows I make them bigger.'

Indeed, on the day we meet she's painted make-up on her eyebrows. War paint for a surprisingly normal girl.

Game Of Thrones, Monday morning at 2am and evening at 9pm, Sky Atlantic.
