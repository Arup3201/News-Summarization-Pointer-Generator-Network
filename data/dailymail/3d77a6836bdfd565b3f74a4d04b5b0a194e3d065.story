Its smoke-blackened ceilings lit by builders' lamps, this is the charred Glasgow School of Art library nine months into a painstaking restoration.

Opened in 1909, the Mackintosh Library's dark wood, high windows, ornate balcony and clusters of electric lamps helped it become known as a turning point in modern architecture and one of the finest buildings in Britain.

But the much-loved centre of learning was gutted last year by a blaze sparked when canned spray foam, which a student was using for an art project, drifted into a projector fan and caught alight.

Phoenix from the ashes: Nine months after a fire ravaged the world-renowned Mackintosh Library at Glasgow School of Art, builders have almost finished the painstaking task of making the building structurally sound before a restoration which could cost up to £35million 

Hard work: Its walls still blackened by smoke and lit by builders' lamps, the century-old library has lost the dark wood for which it was known

Precious: The £50million building is Grade A listed, the Scottish equivalent of Grade I, and is being preserved for future use despite the fire

The Grade A-listed library, the equivalent of Grade I listed in England, was designed by the Glasgow-born architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh and was described by critics as his finest work.

He also designed offices for the Scottish newspapers the Daily Record and Glasgow Herald alongside the Royal Highland Fusiliers Regimental Museum in the city.

Its demise began at 12.27pm on May 23 last year in the basement, where undergraduate students were putting the finishing touches to their final year show.

An unnamed student was using highly flammable canned spray foam to fill in the gaps in an artwork which involved three large sheets of foam, each up to three inches thick.

The foam sheets formed three 'walls' framing a fourth blank wall, onto which a digital projector was beaming images when the spraying took place.

As the fumes from the spray foam spread around the room, they were sucked into the cooling fan of the projector and caught alight as they wafted over the heat of the circuit board.

How it looked: Opened in 1909, the Mackintosh Library's dark wood, high windows, ornate balcony and clusters of electric lamps helped it become known as a turning point in modern architecture and one of the finest buildings in Britain

Precious: The original library. The fire prompted anguish in the art and architecture community, which said it was Mackintosh's finest work

Ravaged: The blaze broke out on May 23 last year after a student preparing for a final-year degree exhibition used spray foam near a projector

Damage: The spray foam fumes were ignited by the projector's hot circuit board, and the blaze spread to three larger sheets of foam nearby

Remains: This image released at the time showed the devastating extent of the damage to the library. Piece by piece, the rubble was cleared

The alarm was raised as the fire spread through the spray foam to the larger foam 'walls', but it was too late. The blaze engulfed the basement room and spread to destroy much of the 'iconic and unique' building's west wing.

Eyewitnesses described how firefighters in breathing apparatus stood shoulder to shoulder, forming a human line between the inferno and the unaffected sections of the art school, preventing the blaze from spreading.

Other firefighters then darted in and out of the building, despite the flames, to remove irreplaceable paintings and furniture by Mackintosh after being shown photographs of the artefacts by curators and told where to find them. 

No one was injured in the fire, which after a six-month investigation was put down to a tragic accident by the art school's leaders.

Nine months later, builders are still assessing the extent of the damage as they stabilise the building to prepare for its restoration.

Behind the hoardings: Builders are due to finish their work next month, giving way to nine months of design work for a restored building

Open air: Chiefs hope a fully-restored art school with an exhibition space and visitor centre will open in 2018 or 2019, costing up to £35m

Intact: A spokesman said the 'hen run' on the roof of the building (pictured), which many thought lost, is in fact still structurally sound

Long journey: The Treasury has given £5m and fundraisers have handed over £1m so far, which the Scottish Government has vowed to match

Hard at work: The building was insured for £50m but art school chiefs will receive nowhere near that amount, as the east wing was untouched

Thousands of damaged pieces of building material, including blackened stones from the library walls, have been removed and numbered with chalk in the hope that experts can put them back where they were before.

The building was insured for £50million but art school chiefs will receive nowhere near that amount, because the east wing was almost completely untouched by the fire.

However, they have already received £5million from the Treasury in Whitehall, £1million from fundraisers and another £1million in match funding from the Scottish Government.

Builders are finally due to finish assessing the damage next month, at which a firm of architects will be chosen to lead the restoration project.

Design work will take nine months with builders returning to the site early next year. Chiefs hope a fully-restored art school with an exhibition space and visitor centre will open in 2018 or 2019.

Numbered: Blackened stones from the walls of the building have been labelled with chalk in the hope they can return to their original positions

Artefacts: Hundreds of items which were recovered after the fire have been carefully catalogued, some of them placed in plastic bags

The project is set to cost anywhere between £20million and £35million, and the finished building will not necessarily resemble the design by Charles Rennie Mackintosh.

Art school leaders are tight-lipped about exactly what the design will look like, but they insist it will be 'holistic' and consistent across the whole building.

At the time the Glasgow School of Art vowed the library would ‘rise like a phoenix from the ashes’, partly thanks to detailed blueprints which were left to the school by Mackintosh himself.

‘Mackintosh was an amazing designer but he used ordinary materials,' said a spokesman last May. 

'Those materials are still available today and we have the plans for the library and the photographs, so we can rebuild it. It won’t be tomorrow but we will make it happen.'
