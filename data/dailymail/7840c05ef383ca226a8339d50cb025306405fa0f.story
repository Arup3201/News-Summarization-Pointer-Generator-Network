A Florida animal services director was fired last week after twenty pets were euthanized under her watch in a single day.

The local sheriff's office sent Jacqueline Johnston packing October tenth after barely more than a week on the job.

When Johnston was hired, she claimed her stance was to resort to euthanasia only in extreme situations, according to WFTV. 

Shocking: The Lake County, Florida sheriff's office sent Jacqueline Johnston packing October tenth after barely more than a week on the job. In one of her nine days as director of the county's animal services department, twenty pets were euthanized 

'To be fair some were indeed sick or injured but certainly not all,' Sergeant James Vachon of the Lake County Sheriff's Office told the Orlando Sentinel.

Vachon said a volunteer blew the whistle on Johnston after 18 or 20 animals were put down in one of Johnston's first nine days on the job.

'Law enforcement, especially, has a healthy respect for animals and what they can contribute, so it's a tough thing to hear,' Vachon said.

The county sheriff himself released a statement after Johnston's firing in which he shouldered blame for the startling mishap. 

'This decision was made on our watch and we have taken swift action to ensure it does not happen again.' 

Johnston's brief reign, some say, was a return to maligned former habits of the agency.

According to the Orlando Sentinel, the shelter euthanized 710 dogs and 2,896 cats in 2013 after cutting way back from a shocking 2,037 dogs and 4,404 cats they put down in 2009.
