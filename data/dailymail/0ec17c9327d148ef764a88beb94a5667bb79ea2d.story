Zlatan Ibrahimovic may have struggled to fit in during his season at Barcelona, but the Paris Saint-Germain striker claims he still has plenty of friends at the club.

The Swedish star scored on his return to the Nou Camp and celebrated passionately putting his new side ahead against his old one, before watching Barcelona come back to win 3-1.

But after the game Ibrahimovic played down the suggestion that he had any ill-feeling towards Barca.

When asked if he still had any friends in Barcelona, PSG's talisman, who spent a year in Spain for the 2009/10 campaign, told Spanish TV  'Yes, 90,000 and the 22 players on the field'. 

Ibrahimovic's time at Barcelona is not always remembered particularly fondly, as the Sweden star was often shunted out wide to make room for the supremely talented Lionel Messi. 

'You bought a Ferrari, but you drive it like a Fiat,' Zlatan complained as he failed to get the prominence he felt he deserved.

He has also previously been less than complimentary the club's three biggest stars: ‘Messi, Xavi and Iniesta always obeyed without protest. They were like schoolboys.’

But  he seemed to have put those differences behind him, embracing Messi at the final whistle on a night where both scored from their favoured central positions.
