A woman who was the target of an underworld murder plot is suing the police officers who saved her life, accusing them of breaching her human rights.

The 47-year-old mother has lodged a High Court writ claiming she is penniless after spending almost a decade in a witness protection scheme.

She is seeking £100,000 damages from the Metropolitan Police.

The professional make-up artist and her teenage daughter have been living at a succession of secret addresses in southern England since she and her former partner – a drug dealer with links to the notorious Adams family – were threatened by crime barons.

'Abandoned': Julie, whose name and face are deliberately not being revealed says she's lost everything due to the Metropolitan police. She was put in witness protection almost a decade ago

She says the police prevented her from working during her time in  hiding and that her home in London and other properties were repossessed because she had to abandon them.

Julie (not her real name) said: ‘I have lost everything. I feel totally abandoned by the police.

‘I was promised that the Met would reimburse any losses I suffered as a result of going into their witness protection programme. Instead I have been left with no money and am still scared of every knock at the door.’

She has issued a High Court writ  in which she claims that the force’s ‘dishonest’ treatment of her breached her human rights.

Last week the Adams family crime syndicate was targeted in a series of raids by more than 200 police officers on 22 homes in North London. Some 15 people were arrested and thousands of pounds’ worth of property confiscated.

Julie’s ordeal is alleged to have begun when police seized a large consignment of cannabis from a van being driven by her then boyfriend.

He is said to have deliberately 
crashed the vehicle to get arrested rather than face the wrath of 
criminals who believed he had double-crossed them.

Police
 telephoned Julie with a warning that a hitman had been hired to kill 
her for disobeying a gangland order to sell her family’s property 
portfolio so that her boyfriend’s ‘debt’ to the drug overlords could be 
repaid.

She was met at the end of her street by two detectives who named the would-be killer as Mark Dorling.

The police told Julie they had uncovered a plot to murder her at her daughter’s school fete later that day.

She
 said: ‘I was just numb. I couldn’t believe anyone would plan a killing 
at a nice posh school where soap stars sent their kids.

‘But
 the officers insisted my life was in real danger and I needed to go 
into witness protection with my family straight away. To be told the 
Adams family were after me was terrifying.’

Dorling would later be jailed for 25 years for stabbing to death a former prison officer.

Julie claims she was told she might have to spend six months under police protection until the opening of Dorling’s murder trial, at which she gave evidence for the prosecution.

She said: ‘Those six months turned into years. My mother, daughter and  I were moved to nine homes between 2003 and 2011 for our own safety. We were virtually living on the run, scared of every knock at the door.

‘My houses were repossessed. I couldn’t maintain them or afford to keep them going.’

Her case is due to be heard later this year. She says she cannot afford a solicitor and will represent herself.

‘I did the right thing by giving evidence but I have been very badly let down by the police. I trusted them but they have not kept their promise to compensate me for helping them put away a very dangerous man.

‘Life under witness protection has been awful and left me penniless.’

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘We have received a claim and are considering it.’
