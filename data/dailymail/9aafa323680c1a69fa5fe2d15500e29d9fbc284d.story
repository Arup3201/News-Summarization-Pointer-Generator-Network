Watching from his seat up in the Villa Park stands, Alan Pardew will know Crystal Palace need to perform better than this once he steps down to the dug-out.

Keith Millen oversaw a second away point in succession as caretaker manager — not to be sniffed at in their predicament. But, quite simply, Pardew must make Palace a greater attacking force. Brad Guzan was not called into meaningful action once.

Pardew congratulated the players and Millen in the dressing room afterwards for their organisation, but told them sparkle is needed to survive.

‘He had no input before the game or during,’ said Millen. 

‘He came down after, shook everyone’s hands and was pleased and proud of what he’d seen. But we need to add goals to stay up.

‘He knows we need a different dimension. I’m sure he will have talked to the chairman about transfers. We know we need to bring in players.’

Pardew is expected to take his first Palace training session on Friday and Millen has been told his services are wanted by the incoming manager, who could be seen in the directors’ box as the match meandered along. No need for notebooks to record the details of this dire game.

Aston Villa’s role cannot be discounted. They continued to pass the ball as instructed by Paul Lambert but moves broke down far too easily, far too frequently.

Their goal tally stays stock still at 11 in 20 Premier League games, the lowest in England’s top four divisions. They have failed to score in 12 matches in all competitions this season. 

There were boos at half-time. Louder boos at the final whistle.

In the first half, Alan Hutton was presented with an excellent chance to score his second of the season when Aly Cissokho’s cross fell kindly. But Julian Speroni spread himself large and blocked the shot brilliantly.

Ron Vlaar was then forced from the field having injured his knee in a collision with Wilfried Zaha. He suffered a similar problem for Holland at the World Cup, Lambert said afterwards.

Yannick Bolasie sprinted clear like a 100m runner, away from Jores Okore and across Ciaran Clark, but sent his shot smacking against the crossbar.

Alas, that was to be as exciting as it got. The rest of the game an affair void of speed, creativity or flow. 

Palace had failed to score in four of their last five away games so another blank here was no shock.
