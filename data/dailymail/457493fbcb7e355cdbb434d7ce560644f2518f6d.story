A leading Boston-based obesity surgeon has been suspended amid accusations of negligence in his treatment of four patients - two of whom subsequently died.

Dr. Sheldon Randall was declared an ‘immediate and serious threat’ to the public by the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine panel, which recently suspended his medical license.

The board found that Randall, 61, had failed to meet adequate standards of care by not recognizing and treating post-surgery complications quickly enough in the four cases cited.

Prior to his suspension, Randall had been long considered an expert in his field.

He had performed more than 6,000 weight-loss operations in his 30-year career - nearly one every weekday - and his bariatric surgery programs had been designated national centers of excellence by surgeons’ groups.

Randall has denied the allegations against him and is appealing his suspension.

His legal team claim he provided good care for this patients and four prominent Harvard physicians have written letters to the board supporting him.

His suspension only came about after a 
protracted series of events which exposes serious communications 
problems between hospitals and the medical board over issues such as 
disciplinary actions, reports The Boston Globe.

Although two of Randall’s employers - Hallmark Health System and Winchester Hospital – suspended him in March 2012, he continued working for a third - MetroWest Medical Center – for another right up until several days before the board took away his license in August of this year.

It was during that 17-month period, that the board alleges that Randall negligently cared for two gastric bypass patients at MetroWest, including a 67-year-old woman who died after her surgery.

In her case, the board said Randall failed to quickly evaluate her for a bowel obstruction when she began vomiting several days after surgery.

The medical board began investigating Randall in Spring 2012, not long after he had operated on Scott Ferullo, a 45-year-old construction worker.

Ferullo underwent open gastric bypass surgery at Hallmark’s Lawrence Memorial Hospital in Medford, and died four days later in terrible pain.

Investigators said Randall failed to promptly investigate whether his patient had a leak or bleeding at the surgery site.

Hallmark suspended Randall that day and he resigned permanently in November 2012 - two and a half months before the 67-year-old MetroWest patient died.

These allegations aren't the first time that Randall has faced accusations of negligence. During the past 13 years at least eight patients or their 
survivors have sued Randall on grounds of medical malpractice and at least three have been settled for undisclosed 
amounts.

Hallmark 
had even suspended Randall’s privileges for five weeks in February 2011 because of a 'death in the
course of/resulting from surgery,’ although this death was not included in the board’s allegations against him.
