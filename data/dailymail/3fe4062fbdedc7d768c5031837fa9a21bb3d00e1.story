A former Nottingham Forest defender crashed his penalty against the woodwork and QPR’s unwanted goalkeeper emerged a World Cup hero for a team coached by a man who was sacked after seven months at Chelsea.

England’s elite are back home - or in Dubai or the Caribbean - with their expensively-insured feet up, resting ahead of the new season while others, many from the depths of the Barclays Premier League and below, are making an impact in Brazil.

Agonising: Jara's firmly-hit penalty crashes against the post to send Brazil through to the quarter-finals

Hero: Cesar is swamped by his ecstatic team-mates as Jara trudges off in the background after hitting the post

Take Gonzalo Jara, at the City Ground last season, or, as West Bromwich Albion once said: 'Please take Gonzalo Jara'.

In four years at the Hawthorns, 
Jara’s most memorable contribution was a violent lunge on Luke Varney 
which reduced Albion to nine men in a vital game at Blackpool, but he 
has been a fixture at the back in this dashing Chile team.

Alongside him there’s Gary Medel, 
seemingly held together by sticky-tape and rubber bands, at the end of a
 gruelling and emotional season in which he was unable to keep Cardiff 
in the Premier League.

Having seen off Spain, the Chileans 
took the hosts to penalties, only to be thwarted by two saves in the 
shoot-out by Julio Cesar. That’s the same Julio Cesar who appeared once 
for QPR last season (a 4-0 FA Cup defeat at Everton) and was kept out of
 the side by Rob Green (not good enough for England’s squad) and then 
farmed out on loan to Toronto. 

West Ham reject: Armero celebrates after Colombia's 2-1 win against Ivory Coast in the group stages

Captain: West Brom defender Diego Lugano leads Uruguay into the dressing room after their win over Italy

When Colombia line up for their 
quarter-final against Big Phil Scolari’s Brazil on Friday, Pablo Armero 
will probably be at left-back. Armero joined West Ham on loan from 
Napoli in January and has since signed for Udinese, but started only 
three games for the Hammers, kept out mostly by George McCartney. 

It defies the idea that you have to 
be playing in the Champions League to prosper in the World Cup, and 
supports the theory that whatever makes you effective in the Premier 
League, does not automatically transfer to international football. 

In Uruguay’s squad were Gaston 
Ramirez, Diego Lugano and Sebastian Coates, who have not dazzled in English club football.

Mexico included Premier League flops Carlos 
Salcido (Fulham) and Giovani dos Santos (Spurs and Faces nightclub) in 
the team which started against Holland in Fortaleza.

It was Dos Santos who scored Mexico's goal against Louis van Gaal's side, and appeared to have put El Tricolor through to the quarter-finals, only for a late Dutch surge to turn the game around.

Fulham flop: Ruiz celebrates his goal that put Costa Rica ahead in their last-16 clash with Greece

Are you watching Arsene? Campbell powers past Premier League talent worth more than £50million

Costa Rica won England’s group, 
powered by Joel Campbell (no games in three years as an Arsenal player, 
although this is a work-permit influenced fact) and Bryan Ruiz (booed 
out of Fulham and exiled on loan at PSV Eindhoven). 

In Recife on Sunday, they met 
Greece, who featured in their squad two more Fulham misfits: ancient 
warrior Giorgis Karagounis and Kostas Mitroglou, destined to go down as 
perhaps the biggest waste of money at Craven Cottage since Steve Marlet.

Algeria have advanced with Essaid 
Belkalem of Watford, Rafik Hallice, another who failed to impress at 
Fulham, Madjid Bougherra, once of Crewe, Sheffield Wednesday and 
Charlton and talented Spurs youngster Nabil Bentaleb.

Free agent: Ameobi tussles with Muhamed Besic for the ball during Nigeria's game against Bosnia

Nigeria, who take on France on 
Monday, contain several familiar names from English football like Shola 
Ameobi, Victor Moses and Peter Odemwingie, Range Rover driving star of 
Sky Sports News transfer deadline day special with three permanent clubs
 in less than a year, who scored the only goal of the game against 
Bosnia to clinch a place in the last 16.

Ever-present at the back is Kenneth 
Omeruo, a 20-year-old Chelsea centre-half signed from Belgium as a 
teenager who spent last season on loan at Middlesbrough.

With him in
 defence has been Joseph Yobo, long of Everton, now of Fenerbahce, who 
spent six months at Norwich helping them into the Championship. 

Then there’s the Swiss, with rejects 
like Johan Djourou, Valon Behrami and Philippe Senderos, oft-ridiculed 
centre-half when at Arsenal and Fulham who is poised to return to the 
Premier League with Aston Villa, thriving in a national team who provide
 England with their next competitive opposition, in September.

It might 
be tempting fate to say much more.
