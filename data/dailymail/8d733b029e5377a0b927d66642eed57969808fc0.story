II is not a greeting you hear so often these days.

But ‘How do you do?’ is the perfect icebreaker and should be brought back into use, according to experts.

A campaign has started to reinstate the phrase, with advocates claiming the English have not known how to interact since it went out of fashion.

Kate Fox, co-director of the Social Issues Research Centre and fellow of the Institute for Cultural Research, said the greeting’s demise had left people puzzled – no longer instinctively knowing how to respond when they meet each other.

The social anthropologist said the phrases we have replaced it with, including ‘Nice to meet you’, were rigged with problems and risks of faux pas.

Speaking at the Hay Festival, she argued that ‘every other nation on Earth’ had developed a simple, standardised greeting understood by all.

‘I know people think that “How do you do?” is an archaic, stuffy … thing to say. But we really should be mounting a campaign for its revival because since “How do you do?” declined as a standard greeting we haven’t known what to say.

‘There is a “Nice to meet you”, but quite a lot of upper middle class people aren’t happy with that because the etiquette books frown on it … We seem to be the only ones who can’t reach a consensus.’
