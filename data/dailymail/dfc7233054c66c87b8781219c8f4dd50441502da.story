A pensioner who suffered a punctured lung and four broken ribs after being thrown out of his seat when the driver made an emergency stop is hoping to win more than £10,000 in compensation.

David Lloyd, 66, was left with horrific injuries when he was thrown to the floor of the single-decker 825 Arriva Midlands bus as it travelled from Stafford to Rugeley in Staffordshire.

The father-of-three and grandfather-of-one managed to make his way home following the incident but later collapsed and was taken to hospital where he spent seven days in the critical care unit.

He is now hoping to win at least £10,000 in compensation from the bus company after claiming he 'almost died' and that the injuries have ruined his life.

He said: 'I felt myself thrown down with great force onto the metal floor.

'I'd just taken my mobile phone out of my pocket when the driver hit the brakes very hard and, sitting in the front seat, I had nothing to hold on to, to stop myself from falling.

'I landed sprawled out on the floor of the bus about 10ft away from my seat.

'I've never been in so much pain in my life. I didn't know where I was.

'I didn't realise just how injured I was so made my own way home. When I got in the pain got so much worse and my wife drove me to hospital.'

The retired technical advisor for bathroom maker Armitage Shanks claims he sustained the injuries when the bus driver made an emergency stop on August 20 last year.

He said the driver was forced to stop abruptly on the approach to a roundabout to avoid a collision with a motorcyclist.

Mr Lloyd is hoping to sue Arriva Midlands for in excess of £10,000 after claiming he 'almost died' and that the injuries have ruined his life. He said: 'My injuries were very nasty and it has had a profound effect on my life'

The incident occurred on a  single-decker 825 Arriva Midlands bus (like the one pictured above) as it travelled from Stafford to Rugeley in Staffordshire. Arriva Midlands is currently carrying out an internal investigaion

He said: 'The lady sitting next to me said the driver was trying to get onto a roundabout ahead of a motorbike when he suddenly slammed the brakes on.

'My consultant Dr Dominic Macleod has written a letter supporting my claim for compensation saying my injuries were 'potentially life-threatening and of a serious nature'.

'Arriva has point blank refused to accept any responsibility. I am staggered. I almost died as a result of being on their bus and they say there are not to blame.

'I am determined to get justice for this. My injuries were very nasty and it has had a profound effect on my life.

'I still find it hard to stand up and I have a pain in my groin when I walk.'

He complained to Arriva Midlands, which is now carrying out an internal investigation, and said he is in the early stages of consulting lawyers.

A spokesman for Arriva Midlands said: 'Arrive Midlands would not wish to make any further statement regarding this matter which is still ongoing.'
