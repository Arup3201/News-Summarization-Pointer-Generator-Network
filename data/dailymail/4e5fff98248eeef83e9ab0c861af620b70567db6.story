Almost 150 criminals have been let out of jail by mistake in the last four years, and at least 24 of them are still on the run.

The astonishing admission by ministers sparked claims communities are being put at risk by offenders who should be behind bars.

Official figures showing that an inmate is accidentally allowed to walk free almost every week were branded an 'insult' to victims of crime.

Bungles in prisons across the country see on average one inmate let out by mistake almost every week

Since May 2010 when the coalition was formed on promise to deliver a tougher law and order agenda, 148 criminals have been released in error from jails in England and Wales.

Most are caused by bungled paperwork but some are linked to errors in the lengthy of time inmates are supposed to be held behind bars.

Ministers insist most of those let out in error are quickly picked up again.

But new figures show at least 24 people who should be in prison are on the run after prison staff showed them the door.

It includes at least three women from closed prisons and 13 category C prisoners.

The figures were released by the Ministry of Justice in a series of responses to parliamentary questions by Labour.

Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said communities were being put at risk by criminals who should be behind bars

Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said: 'Each week brings more evidence showing David Cameron's justice system is in chaos.

'I'm astounded that 148 criminals have been wrongly released from prison on this Government's watch. But to add insult to injury, 24 of them are still on the run.

'Victims will be insulted that criminals are allowed to waltz out of jail so easily, and continue to live their lives scot free.

'Communities are being put at risk by serious and dangerous criminals walking the streets when they should be safely behind bars.

’How are the British public to trust David Cameron's Government to keep them safe when they are so terrible at the basics like keeping criminals locked up.'

In the 12 months to September 2013 there were 46 criminals released from jail in error.

The government insists this bungled releases equate to 0.06 per cent of all discharges from prison.

Prisons minister Jeremy Wright said: ’Releases in error are taken very seriously and action has been taken to tighten processes and focus managers' attention in this area.

’Releases in error are infrequent and all incidents are subject to investigation. The majority of prisoners released in error are returned to custody quickly.’

In some instances, inmates let out by mistake are not returned to prison because the case against them is concluded while they are at large.
