It will be trebles all round on Sunday night when two of the most expensive forward lines of all time come face to face in the Camp Nou – Barcelona’s three-pronged attack of Luis Suarez, Neymar and Leo Messi up against Real Madrid trio Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema.

Carlo Anceotti’s threesome have the edge so far this season having scored 56 goals between them — one more than Luis Enrique’s attack. But with Luis Suarez missing the first two months of the season and Messi out of form before the turn of the year, there is a feeling that the Barcelona strike-force gave their Madrid counterparts a head start and are about to go past them.

There is also a feeling at a club that has a history of brilliant front threes that this particular Barcelona group could finish up being the best ever.

It was in the 2008-09 season that Thierry Henry, Samuel Eto’o and Messi scored 100 goals between them in one campaign with the former Arsenal striker scoring 26, Eto’o 36 and Messi 38.

Henry was at the Nou Camp on Wednesday to cover Barcelona’s victory over Manchester City for Sky and went down to the Barcelona dressing room after the game to congratulate the players who could yet break that scoring record this season.

Following the Henry/Eto’o/Messi forward line came the Messi/David Villa/Pedro one that also won a European Cup against Manchester United. They scored 98 goals in the 2010-11 season with Messi getting 53, Villa 23 and Pedro 21.

Both attacks had a tendency to come good in the Clasico and Henry played in one of the most famous Real Madrid-Barcelona games in 2009 with Barca winning 6-2 at the Bernabeu, Henry and Messi both scoring twice.

On Sunday it is the Barcelona three who are in the best form, although none of them could get past Joe Hart on Wednesday.

Real Madrid’s ‘BBC’ forward line are a little more out of sorts with Benzema, Bale and Cristiano having scored five each since the turn of the year. Tomorrow at the home of their biggest rivals would be the perfect time and place to alter the trend once more.
