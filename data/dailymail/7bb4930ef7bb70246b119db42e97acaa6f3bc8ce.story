Blank cheque: Lord Neuberger, who is the president of the Supreme Court, said the Human Rights Act has given courts a blank cheque to make up the law

The Human Rights Act has given courts a blank cheque to make up the law, a senior judge said yesterday.

Lord Neuberger, who is the president of the Supreme Court, said the Act effectively gave the views of the judiciary precedence over Parliament. He said this extra power for judges was a good thing – because it kept governments in check.

British judges have increasingly defied ministers since the Act was passed by Labour in 1998. The Appeal Court shot down rules to prevent sham marriages by ruling they discriminated against immigrants. And judges have used the Act to dismantle attempts to control terror suspects.

In his landmark speech, Lord Neuberger cited a key judgment from June in which the Supreme Court declared it had the power – so far unused – to tell the Government to legalise assisted suicide.

The 1961 Suicide Act makes clear that helping someone to die is a serious crime punishable by up to 14 years in prison. But judges and prosecutors have opened up a defence for those who act out of compassion – defying Parliament’s wishes and effectively wiping out much of the meaning of the law it had laid down.

Lord Neuberger’s intervention comes at a time when the future of the Human Rights Act and the supremacy over British courts of the Strasbourg-based European Court of Human Rights are being questioned.

David Cameron’s July reshuffle shifted opponents of constitutional reform out of the Government and replaced them with eurosceptics who want to end the power of Strasbourg to give votes to prisoners or prevent the deportation of terror suspects. They also want to rein in British judges who use human rights to establish new law on privacy or assisted suicide.

The reshuffle has led to speculation that the next Tory manifesto will promise repeal of the Human Rights Act and its replacement with a British bill of rights.

Lord Neuberger is the leader of the 12 judges who have the final say in Britain on how the laws set by Parliament are interpreted.

He said in a speech given to lawyers in Melbourne, Australia, that the Human Rights Act allows courts ‘to interpret statutes in a way which some may say amounts not so much to construction as to demolition and reconstruction’.

‘We can give provisions meanings which they could not possibly bear if the normal rules of statutory interpretation applied,’ Lord Neuberger said. ‘Parliament has written us judges something of a bank cheque in this connection.’

He said that ‘this new judicial power of quasi-interpretation can be said to involve a subtle but significant adjustment to the balance of power between the legislature and the judiciary’. He added: ‘The UK approach can be seen as effectively conferring a law-making function on the judiciary.’

He said the European human rights convention had become ‘something of a whipping boy for some politicians and newspapers’ but that ‘this appears to many people to be unfortunate’.

Very few Strasbourg court decisions were misconceived, he said. ‘You only have to look at the history of Germany over the last 100 years to see how valuable it can be for judges to be given a substantial role, supported by the rule of law, in protecting individuals against the might of the modern state.’

The British government, Lord Neuberger said, is very powerful, with its power ‘reinforced by what can sometimes appear to be the relative lack of independence of a legislature which can be said to be controlled by the head of the executive, namely the prime minister.’

Lord Neuberger’s speech also asserted the supremacy of British judges over the European Court of Human Rights. He said they should not follow their traditional common law training, in which judges usually follow precedents set in earlier cases.
