Roger Federer struggled but survived to make the fourth round of the French Open.

The 17-time grand slam champion found the going tough against Russian 31st seed Dmitry Tursunov and needed more than three hours to grind out a 7-5 6-7 (7/9) 6-2 6-4 victory.

Federer admitted after facing Diego Sebastian Schwartzman in the second round he had not felt relaxed but put that down to an unknown opponent.

That was not the case with Tursunov, who Federer had beaten in all four of their previous meetings, although they did have a tight tussle in Indian Wells in March.

Blip: The Swiss maestro lost the second set in a tie break but recovered soon after

The
 Russian is a talented ball-striker and matched Federer throughout the 
first set until the Swiss took his chance in the final game.

It
 looked like the second set would go exactly the same way when Tursunov 
slipped to 0-40 at 5-6 but this time he saved all three set points.

Federer
 had another in the tie-break but it was Tursunov who took his second 
opportunity with a searing forehand winner down the line.

Federer
 made the perfect start to the third set with a break in the opening 
game, and it became clear all was not well with Tursunov when he headed 
off court for lengthy treatment from the trainer after the third game.

Test: Federer needed just over three hours to see off his Russian opponent on Court Philippe Chatrier

Undone: After hanging in there for the first two sets, the No 31 seed from Russia was beaten in four

All smiles: Federer's wife Mirka enjoyed what she saw on court at Roland Garros

But,
 although he wrapped up the third set relatively quickly, Federer 
continued to make heavy weather of the victory, finally taking just the 
fourth of 21 break points in the seventh game of the decider.

It
 gave Federer yet another piece of tennis history, the 32-year-old 
becoming the first man to reach the fourth round at Roland Garros for a 
12th time.

Next he faces 
what is sure to be a highly-anticipated clash against Latvian crowd 
pleaser Ernests Gulbis, who is finally starting to live up to his 
talent.
