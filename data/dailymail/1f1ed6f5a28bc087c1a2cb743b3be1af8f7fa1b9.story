A Chicago bar has come under fire for inviting punters to celebrate the 72nd anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor with 'Bombs & Kamikaze' cocktails.

The drinks promotion, posted by Murphy's Bleachers bar in Chicago's Wrigleyville neighborhood, was taken down after the bar was flooded with angry complaints from regulars.

The ill-thought out message was placed on the bars outdoor marquee on Saturday, and said: 'Remember Pearl Harbor With Bombs & Kamikazes'.

The bar has since apologized 'to our whole country' after angry comments were posted on the business' Facebook page and Twitter feeds, the Huffington Post reports.

The bar announced via its Twitter feed shortly after: 'This awful marquee has been taken down. We apologize for the actions of our staff to our whole country.'

A Kamikaze cocktail is made of equal parts vodka, triple sec and lime juice, whereas a bomb, in some bars, contains vodka, gin, peach schnapps, cinnamon schnapps and light rum.

The bar joined other brands and business which joins businesses and brands which have been criticised for launching controversial promotions and 'remembrances' for events like 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy - including AT&T, and Groupon.

Campbell Soup was also forced into an apology on Saturday for a tweet by its SpaghettiOs brand, marking the anniversary.

The company had tweeted a picture of its grinning mascot holding an American flag and wearing trainers, alongside the message 'Take a moment to remember #PearlHarbor with us'.

The company's attempt to sell SpaghettiOs with a smile on a tragic remembrance got some twitter users talking.

'Hope nobody minds if I chose to remember Pearl Harbor and forever forget @SpaghettiOs. #TastelessCorporation,' said twitter user simply Laura.

'I can't wait for the official @spaghettiOs 9/11 tweet,' said Suzan Eraslan.

'@SpaghettiOs maybe sit out the next couple plays,' said Andy Levy.

Once SpaghettiOs caught wind of the fact that they offended the blogosphere, they issued a formal apology on December 7.

'We apologize for our recent tweet in remembrance of Pearl Harbor Day. We meant to pay respect, not to offend.'

Marketingland.com reported that the offensive tweet got over 3,000 retweets but not out of popularity, rather out of disgust.

Saturday marked the 72nd anniversary of the attack on Hawaii's Pearl Harbor in which more than 2,500 people lost their lives.
