A short-sighted hunter who allegedly shot a motorist dead and wounded his passenger after mistaking their car for a wild boar could face five years in jail.

Zbigniew Kowalski, 60, from Leczyca, in Poland, spotted the car, which was being driven by Josef Kuchar, while out hunting in a nearby forest.

Mistaking the vehicle for a wild boar, he let off a number of shots, allegedly hitting Mr Kuchar, 23, in the neck and Lukasz Nowakowski, 21, who survived the incident, in the chest.

Police have confirmed Zbigniew Kowalski will be charged with manslaughter after he allegedly shot a driver dead and wounded his passenger when he mistook their car for a wild boar

Mr Kuchar, who later died from his injuries, managed to drive the pair to his home where his parents called for an ambulance.

Prosecutor Krzystof Kopania said: 'The two men were wounded, but the driver Josef Kuchar, who later died, managed to drive them both to his home where his parents immediately called an ambulance.

'But by the time he got to hospital it was too late.

'We identified the hunter, he was immediately detained and he confirmed that he had mistakenly shot at the car. 

Kowalski later said he had not called police because he had seen the car drive off and assumed he had missed the vehicle. Pictured is the scene of the incident

'He realised his mistake when the "wild boar" started its engine and drove off, but because whoever had driven off had clearly been alive he assumed he had missed the vehicle.'

Kowalski later said he had not called police as a result and had carried on hunting. 

It was only when police cars turned up and he was questioned by officers did he realise he had  hit somebody in the car.

Mr Kopania confirmed that he will now be charged with manslaughter.
