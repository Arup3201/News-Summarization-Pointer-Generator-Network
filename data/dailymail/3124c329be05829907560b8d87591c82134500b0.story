A man has been arrested after he allegedly tried to hire a teenager for $600 a week and an iPhone.

'Sugar babies' are women who date rich older men and receive money and gifts in exchange, something the Miami New Times has reported on.

But this girl was only 15 and a Miami man was arrested after he traveled to a park in Pembroke Pines to meet the teenager with an iPhone, some gift cards and cannabis.

Accused: Raul Torres (right) is accused of arranging to meet the fictitious 15-year-old girl after they chatted on the internet

Instead of meeting the schoolgirl, he was caught by police after they arranged a sting operation.

Raul Alejandro Torres, 34, allegedly posted an online ad called 'Sugahdaddi 4Sugahbaybe 34(FLL).'

Though its not clear that that Torres was specifically looking for an underaged girl, a Pembroke Pines detective responded to the ad in the guise of a 15-year-old girl. Police say that Torres was made well aware that his imaginary chat partner was underage.

'Age is just a number,' he reportedly told the undercover detective.

The detective made arrangements with Torres to meet at a park.Â 

iPhone: Torres allegedly agreed to buy an iPhone for the girl as well as give her hundreds of dollars

Torres agreed to buy an iPhone 5 for the girl and give her $400 up front, and then paying her an allowance of $600 a week for her continued services and companionship.

He also promised to bring cannabis to the meeting.

When Torres arrived he was met by police. They found the phone, four gift cards worth $100, and a small amount of pot.

He was charged with using a computer and traveling to meet a minor for unlawful sexual conduct, possession of cannabis under 20 grams and violation of probation. He was not offered bond due to his probation violation.
