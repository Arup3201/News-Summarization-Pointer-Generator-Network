Ruth Wilson may be earning rave reviews for her role in raunchy US mini-series The Affair, but the actress has joked that the graphic bedroom scenes have turned her off sex for life.

The show, co-starring fellow Brit Dominic West, is set to air in Britain later this year. Miss Wilson, 32, has already been hailed as a ‘breakout star’ by Hollywood bible Daily Variety for her part as a married waitress who steals West’s character away from his wife and four children.

But she has admitted she is a ‘prude’ when it comes to filming explicit material, saying: ‘I’m a British prude and dread any sex scene that has to be performed. For an actor they are miserable and vaguely embarrassing. It’s put me off sex for life.’

Ruth with fellow British actor Dominic West, 45, whom she steals from his wife and four children, says she dreaded the saucy sex scenes which she says 'for an actor they are miserable and vaguely embarrassing'

Ruth, pictured in a passionate kiss with West in the series, says if 'sex is just for titillation it slows up the story'

She went on to claim: ‘The sex isn’t gratuitous. I was intent on trying to tell a story within those scenes. It’s not just about the sex, it’s about what is going on in each individual’s mind during it. If it’s just for titillation I think it slows up a story.’

West, 45, revealed that he was ‘concerned’ about his 15-year-old daughter watching his graphic sex scenes, adding: ‘There’s really an awful lot of sex in this. Hopefully it’s hot and erotic. It’s certainly a sexy show. I’m slightly concerned about my daughter seeing it.’

Wilson first shot to fame in the 2006 BBC mini-series Jane Eyre. She won two Olivier awards for her work on the West End stage and played a psychopathic killer opposite Idris Elba in the hit BBC crime series Luther. However after playing her impeccably dressed Luther character Alice Morgan, she said: ‘It’s lovely to go onto the set of The Affair and not have to be perfectly coiffed.’
