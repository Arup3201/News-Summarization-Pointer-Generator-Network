A court has seen a dramatic video revealing the final moments of two teenagers who died while 'car surfing' before the SUV overturned and burst into flames.

Carlos Velazco and Hunter Perez, both 18, were clinging to the side of their 19-year-old friend Joshua Ritter’s speeding car in DeBary, Florida.

Emotional relatives watched the mobile phone clip in a Deland court. The two friends died while Ritter survived the incident  last February.

One teenager is heard saying on the video: ‘If I died, remember this is Carlos's idea.’ Another voice on the tape says: ‘This is insane.’

Moments before the car overturned one of the boys his heard screaming: ’Whoa, Stop.’ The footage then goes blank.

Two other passengers, Ryan Jenkins, 17 and Kenyanna Hawkins, 18, were hospitalised, as was Ritter. But Ryan and Kenyanna were never charged.

Ritter had wept and apologised for his actions after pleading no contest to reckless driving and vehicular homicide.

‘I can't start to explain how sorry I am for everything that happened,’ said Ritter, who could have faced up to 35 years in prison.

‘I am so sorry to all the families,’ he added. ‘I'll never forget what happened and I'll try to do whatever I can to make it right.’

Ritter, whose father is a police officer, was behind the wheel of the Nissan Pathfinder when it crashed on a dirt road.

Carlos was thrown from the side of the vehicle, while Hunter was trapped inside and died when it burst into flames.

Hunter’s mother Robin Parker told the court: ‘I get no pleasure from your pain, but you must be held accountable for two lives lost.

‘Justice will be over for everyone today, but I'll be dressed in this black for the rest of my life,’ the 50-year-old added.

After the judge agreed with prosecutors to sentence Ritter to probation and house arrest, she stormed out of the courtroom.
