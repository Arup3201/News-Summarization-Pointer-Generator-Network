A distraught mother says she cannot leave the house after undergoing a 'botched' eyebrow tattoo.

Marie Johnson, 43, from Walker, Newcastle, had imagined elegant light brown brows would transform her look.

But now she says she breaks down in tears every time she looks in the mirror - and she is even considering launching a legal claim over the £120 semi-permanent cosmetic procedure.

Marie Johnson is preparing to launch a legal claim and says her tattoo has left her looking 'like a clown'

But the tattooist says the eyebrow inkings - which were discussed with Marie - will shrink and fade as the area heals, and the matter has been 'blown out of proportion'.

The tattoos were done on Friday at Pretty In Ink, on Linden Terrace, Whitley Bay, as an early Mother’s Day gift from 18-year-old daughter Leonie.

Marie had wanted her eyebrows to look more substantial as they were beginning to thin.

'I had been getting down and my daughter said I should get the tattoo for a Mother’s Day present,' she said. 'The pictures online looked excellent.'

A consultation cost the family £60 before Marie went to Whitley Bay for the procedure on Friday. But Marie was immediately disappointed with the results.

'When I sat up I was instantly horrified,' she said. 'I said: "What have you done? This isn’t what I asked for."

'She had given me thick brows. I look like something between a drag queen and a clown. I’m absolutely devastated, I’m horrified.

'In the picture, the brows were a lot thinner and a lot lighter - a natural sort of colour. Leonie keeps saying she’s sorry because she feels like she is to blame.'

A spokeswoman for Pretty In Ink said the matter has been 'blown out of proportion' and the procedure was discussed with the client fully.

She said: 'At one stage, [the eyebrow tattoo] did look a little thin, which Marie agreed, so I did [them] thicker for her and I showed her in the mirror at that time.

'As I did explain to her, within the four-week healing process, they will lose up to 40 per cent of the colour and shrink.'

Marie fears the semi-permanent tattoos could last anywhere from two to six years.

She added: 'My daughter can’t look at me and I can’t look in the mirror.'

A North Tyneside Council spokeswoman confirmed they are investigating a complaint.

She said: 'We can confirm we have received a complaint about a registered tattooist in North Tyneside.

'The complaint relates to several different issues and these are currently being investigated.

'However, we have advised the complainant that the issue concerning the quality of service provided would be a civil matter.'
