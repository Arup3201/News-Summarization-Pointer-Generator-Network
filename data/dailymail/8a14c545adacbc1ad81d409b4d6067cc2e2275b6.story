United Nations ambassador Samantha Powers has missed her first emergency security council meeting because she was on a personal trip less than a month after being sworn into office.

Ms Powers, who became the United State's representative to the U.N. on August 1, is on a personal trip and was unable to make the emergency meeting on Wednesday following the alleged chemical weapons attack in Syria.

'Ambassador Power is on a long planned personal trip,' National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan.Â 

A few weeks in: Samantha Power was sworn in as the United States representative to the UN on August 1

'She has full communications and has been fully engaged on all national security issues.'

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki confirmed in her press briefing on Thursday that earlier in the week Ms Powers attended a National Security Council meeting that President Obama called to deal with the crisis in Egypt.

Fox News is reporting that the 42-year-old married mother of two is in Ireland with her family.

Power was born in Ireland and lived there until she was 9-years-old when she moved with her family to Atlanta, Georgia. Her relatives still live in Ireland.

CNN has now reported that she has come home and participated in National Security Council meetings remotely.

Conservative commentators for Fox News called on Ms Power to reveal her location publicly, saying that

'Just say where she is. It looks like she's just on vacation. If she is, who cares? Everyone is in August. They should admit it,' Daily Caller editor and Fox commentator Tucker Carlson said.

'I hope the new Ambassador has a really good reason for her absence. Secret trip for UN business? Good reasons I understand,' Fox host Greta Van Susteren wrote on her blog.

While she would not have been able to fly back to the United States in time for the emergency meeting, a deputy attended in her place and she is reportedly staying briefed.

'Reports devastating: 100s dead in streets, including kids killed by chem weapons. UN must get there fast & if true, perps must face justice,' she posted on Twitter on Wednesday.

Wednesday's account is believed to have been caused by chemical weapons but it is not certain as United Nations weapons inspectors have not been allowed in the country.

Horrific; Hundreds died in the alleged chemical attacks on Wednesday, including many women and children

The headcount from the attack- which appears to have included many women and children- is thought to be more than 100 people and all told more than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria since the start of the country's civil war.

It comes as little surprise that Ms Power is an advocate for global action as the majority of her work and expertise has centered around the study of genocide.

She has written books and participated in documentaries about the genocides in Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Armenia and Darfur.

Before being appointed to the United Nations, she worked as a part of President Obama's re-election campaign and then the National Security Council.
