Gwyneth Paltrow has had a tough time recently. Not only has she 'consciously uncoupled' from husband Chris Martin, but she's had to approve of his new girlfriend, Jennifer Lawrence.

It is perhaps then unsurprising that the A-lister has been looking for alternative remedies to help her through her woes.

The star, who recently claimed that water has feelings and called in a psychic to help her to ‘heal and expand’, has this week been seeking the advice of an acupuncturist.

Alternative remedies: Gwyneth Paltrow has this week shared her views on acupuncture, which she says has helped her through 'many an ailment' 

Writing on her weekly Goop, the 42-year-old explains: 'One day, when being treated by an acupuncturist, a Spanish friend who was visiting me in London walked into the room and remarked that I looked like a bull who’d had a run in with the picadores (the dudes on horseback who stick the bull with many little knives to rile him up before the actual fight). 

'I assured her that although I was stuck with needles, I was faring far better than the bull would in the analogous scenario. In fact, those many little needles have helped me through many an ailment.'

The mother-of-two, who swears by a vegan diet and plenty of yoga, explains to her readers that Eastern medicine has a different approach to Western medicine because, she says, it’s more holistic.

She said: 'The root of the problem is addressed, as opposed to a symptom being attended to with prescription medication, only to return. Don’t get me wrong, I am thankful as hell for a round of antibiotics or surgery when necessary, but I have been helped tremendously by all of the practices that help the body heal itself. When implemented by a professional with experience, the benefits can work wonders.'

The health aficionado also cites  goji berries with chrysanthemum flowers, which she brews into a tea and drinks to her calm her red, dry eyes, as one of her favourite alternative remedies. 

Explaining the bizarre treatment, the actress writes: 'Goji berries are all the rage now, Whole Foods sells them and I have even seen them covered in chocolate! (I do not recommend the chocolate-covered ones.) 

'In fact, Goji berries’ health properties are greatly enhanced by cooking them five to ten minutes. Throw them into your hot cereal, soups or even tea. A very nice tea full of B vitamins (the natural way) is chrysanthemum and goji berry tea. Both of these foods happen to be good for the eyes as well.' 

The star tackles the dreaded time of the month cramps with a mug of ginger tea with raw brown sugar and swears by dry body brushing.

Healing: Acupuncture is an ancient treatment first practised in China around 1,000 years ago. It arrived in Europe in the 17th century, but it's really only since the 1970s that there has been strong public interest in it

Despite their marital troubles, Gwyneth and Chris Martin have proved that they are still very friendly with each other, and are perhaps the most civilised ex-partners in showbiz.

The two stars stepped out for dinner together with their family at a sushi restaurant in Los Angeles on Wednesday evening, and shared an affectionate farewell as Gwyneth stroked Chris's face.

Gwyneth and Chris - who have two children together, daughter Apple and son Moses - have been spotted together on several occasions since their split in March this year, although both have moved on to other relationships.

Musician Chris, who organised Gwyneth's recent birthday bash, has been seeing Hollywood starlet Jennifer Lawrence for a few months, and Gwyneth is reportedly seeing Glee's co-creator Brad Falchuck in August.

An ancient treatment first practised in China around 1,000 years ago. It arrived in Europe in the 17th century, but it's really only since the 1970s that there has been strong public interest in it.

How does it work? The traditional Chinese view is that energy - or 'Qi' - flows directly through 12 main channels, called meridians, in the body and if the flow is interrupted it can cause ill-health. Inserting tiny needles and manipulating them at 'trigger points' restores the flow of energy. It is believed the needles stimulate skin and muscle nerves, releasing the body's natural painkillers - endorphins and serotonin - into the pain pathways of the spinal cord and the brain to modify the way pain signals are received. It may also have beneficial effects on the nervous system, muscle tone, hormone production and circulation, as well as breathing, digestion and fertility.

What is it used to treat? Some people have acupuncture to 'strengthen' their constitution. But it is commonly used for anxiety, asthma, arthritis, depression, high blood pressure, infertility, menstrual problems, migraines, rheumatism, skin conditions and ulcers.
