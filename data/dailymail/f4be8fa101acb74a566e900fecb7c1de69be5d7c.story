This is the husband who allegedly burst into a busy pediatric clinic in California and shot dead his estranged wife, before killing himself, in a murder-suicide sparked by a bitter custody dispute.

Neng Moua, 43, stormed a medical office  near Mariposa and S Street in Downtown Fresno on Tuesday morning and starting arguing with a 33-year-old female employee, Fresno police said.

Armed with a 'large shotgun', he then apparently shot the woman - believed to be his estranged spouse with whom he had five children - several times, causing other terrified workers to flee. 

SWAT officers surrounded the building and ordered people to evacuate to a nearby church. A short search of the building led police to the body of the woman, a receptionist at Sang Pediatrics.

'Murder-suicide': Neng Moua (pictured in a previous mug shot), 43,allegedly burst into a busy pediatric clinic and shot dead his estranged wife, before killing himself, in a murder-suicide sparked by a custody dispute

Crime scene: Moua, 43, stormed into the door of a medical office (pictured) near Mariposa and S Street in Downtown Fresno on Tuesday morning and starting arguing with a 33-year-old female employee, police said.

The victim - who had another two children from a previous relationship - was pronounced dead at the scene. Officers also discovered Moua had killed himself, leaving the couple's five children orphans.

On Tuesday afternoon, Fresno Police Lt Joe Gomez confirmed the shooting and said no other injuries had been reported. Police are not searching for other suspects in relation to the incident.

According to a witness, Moua was armed with a large shotgun when he entered the building just before 11am Pacific Time and opened fire after having a verbal dispute with his wife.

Officers arriving on the scene heard one gunshot, followed by more shots as they began to enter the premises to conduct a sweep and an evacuation, Fresno Police Deputy Chief Pat Farmer said. 

There were eight staffers and eight patients at the office at the time of the shooting. Some of them hid in bathrooms, while others were seen climbing out of first-floor windows, ABC reported.

Police broke at least one window to help workers trapped inside the office escape, Gomez said, adding about half the building had been searched as of about 12.30pm local time. 

It has since emerged that the couple at the center of the deadly incident had been locked in a custody battle over their five children. 

The feuding husband and wife had a pending court date in May, and the victim's co-workers believed it may have prompted the shooting Tuesday, Deputy Farmer told reporters this afternoon. 

Moua had a criminal history, which included an arrest on a domestic violence charge 11 years ago.

Nearby St John's Cathedral had to be evacuated during what police initially described as a hostage situation 

Images on local ABC30-TV showed a large police presence at the downtown office building and the station reported that witnesses heard several gunshots there.

The news channel tweeted text messages sent by an office worker to her husband saying she had witnessed the gunman shoot his wife in the chest at close range. 

According to ABC30, a cathedral down the street 'from a hostage situation' was being evacuated, and a helicopter flying overhead was making announcements asking anyone who had seen a man wearing a white overcoat to call 911.
