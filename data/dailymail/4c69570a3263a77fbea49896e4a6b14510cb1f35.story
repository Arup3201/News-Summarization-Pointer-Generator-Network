Spanish paella, pulled pork burger, red velvet cupcakes - These all sound like delicacies from an upscale restaurant not meals for our pooches.

But Asia Upward wanted to be quirky and combine her love for food photography with her love for her dogs, and thus the book 'A Dog's World' was born.

She told Daily Mail Australia that she wanted to raise the stakes and come up with something quirky that would humour people and wasn't the everyday image.

So she substituted humans for dogs.

Asia Upward has released a book that combines recipes for dogs and photography titles 'A Dog's World' 

She said she wanted to raise the stakes and come up with something quirky that wasn't the everyday image.

Asia has tested out most of her recipes on her 10-year-old Ridgeback cross cattle dog, Bear

'I am based in Melbourne and what I have noticed is that there is always a new trend, like the pulled-pork fad,' she said.

Mash the banana thoroughly. 

Add all of the ingredients into a food processor or blender and mix until smooth.

Place mixture into ice cube trays and freeze.

Once frozen they are ready to serve. 

'I thought to myself, wouldn't it be great to do this for my dog - so I did and then started brainstorming more and more ideas for dog recipes.'

Recipes that you will come across in the book range from icy pole bones to winter warming vegetable soup and her personal favourite - red velvet pupcakes.

The healthiness of the meal for the dog is paramount to Asia, so with the cupcakes, she uses beetroot to get the deep red colour and sugar-free yogurt for the icing.

So as delicious as these meals appear in the images to anyone's eye, they are aimed purely at dogs.

'I actually ate the pulled-pork burger once,' Asia said.

'There is obviously no seasoning in any of the meals, its really simple plain food, so I had to add some relish.' 

Recipes in the book range from icy pole bones to winter warming vegetable soup and red velvet pupcakes.

Asia used Gumtree to source the dogs as she was new to Melbourne and did not know many dog owners

Her inspiration for the book has stemmed from her deep, childhood love for dogs

 Asia tested out most of the recipes on her 10-year-old half ridgeback and half cattle dog, Bear.

Her mum rescued Bear from the blue mountains when he was 4-weeks-old.

He was the runt of a litter of puppies whose mother could not adequately care for them so he has been with Asia ever since.

Her inspiration for the book has stemmed from her deep, childhood love for dogs.

'I found a picture of myself when I was three-years-old at my parents house absolutely surrounded by dogs,' she said.

'I didn't have many kids to play with, so I had pets my entire life instead.'

Further motivation came when the Melbourne-based photographer was travelling in Sumatra and experienced the strewn mange, disease and dejection of the street dogs.

Asia is planning another trip to Sri Lanka in September to advocate animal welfare

'There was a tiny puppy crossing the road in front of the car, skinny and sick so I asked the driver if we could do something and he just laughed at me,' she said.

'It broke my heart.'

As soon as Asia returned home she began working on her book and with its release, she aims to raise awareness and funds for Animal SOS Sri Lanka, a charity dedicated to not only rescuing street animals but also educating the people of Sri Lanka in animal welfare.

She is planning another trip over there on the 20th of September to help Animal SOS campaign and advertise their strong message.

On being asked how she sourced the pooches for the shoot, Asia admitted it was not the most orthodox method.

'Believe it or not, I used Gumtree,' she laughed.

'I was new to Melbourne and didn't know any dog owners so I put an ad up on Gumtree and was taken aback by how many people responded.

Asia evidently could not use them all but is keeping everyone in mind for her second book as the characters that she found on set were priceless.

'There was a little French Bulldog who was hilarious, I wanted to get a shot of him looking at the cake but he just launched into it and devoured the entire thing before even looking at it.'
