Puppy love: Beatrice with pet dog Max

Princess Beatrice's pet dog Max has been attacked by the Queen's corgis, it was claimed last night.

The 11-year-old terrier nearly lost an ear and suffered horrific bites during the fight at Balmoral a week ago, according to a source.

It comes just days after another of Beatrice's family dogs, Millie, died of natural causes.

The fight is believed to have started after the Queen's six dogs were taken for a walk with the York family's three Norfolk terriers last Sunday.

The Queen owns three corgis, called Monty, Holly, Willow, and three dorgis – a dachshund and corgi cross – named Cider, Candy and Vulcan.

A source reportedly said: 'It was really nasty. The Queen's dog boy was taking the corgis for a walk and they were joined by the Norfolk terriers, which came [to Balmoral] with Prince Andrew.

'They were being taken along the long corridor leading to the Tower Door before being let into the grounds for a walk and they all became over-excited.

'They began fighting among themselves and unfortunately the dog boy lost control.

'The next thing we knew there were horrific yelps and screams, and it seems the corgis picked on Max.'

The source added that there was 'blood everywhere', and that the dog was 'very badly injured' and needed to be taken to the local vet.

'The Queen and duke were very upset when they were told but the dog is really Beatrice's and she wasn't there either,' the source said.

'She later came up to Scotland and has been looking after Max. He was very lucky to survive.

'I heard the princess was very upset because another of her Norfolk terriers, Millie, died from natural causes just a week or so before.'

The 24-year-old has doted on Max since she was given him as a Christmas present when she was 13. The dog featured on the Duchess of York's 2005 Christmas card and also appeared on a £450 handbag, which she carried to the Royal Family's Easter service at St George's Chapel in 2004.

Max went missing from the Duke of York's home in Windsor Great Park in December 2008, prompting Beatrice to lead a search by torchlight.

It is understood that her mother, the Duchess of York, sister Eugenie and even the Queen lent a helping hand. After three weeks, Max turned up looking bedraggled and hungry.

A Buckingham Palace spokesman declined to comment about the alleged dog fight.

Meanwhile, Prince Harry was spotted partying in Las Vegas with a group of friends following a holiday in the US.

The third in line to the throne was seen at one of the city's infamous pool parties, which was also attended by singer and actress Jennifer Lopez.

The prince was reportedly seen chatting to several girls dressed in bikinis at the alcohol-fuelled 'Wet Republic' party, which was held at the MGM Grand Hotel on the city's main strip.

Harry, wearing shorts, a white panama-style hat and sunglasses, and his friends were also seen jumping in the pool and playing with an inflatable toy whale.

An onlooker said: 'They even had a blow-up whale in their area and were just fooling around and joking and having some drinks and just enjoying themselves.'

The prince was also seen trying his luck at the tables in the upmarket Wynn resort.
