An aristocratic couple who live on a tiny island off the Cornish coast have sold their home for £1million after years of fighting to ban stag and hen parties.

After more than a decade, Lord and Lady Long are moving out of their home on Towan Island, which is connected to the mainland in Newquay by a 100ft crossing.

The only house in the UK with its own suspension bridge, it went on the market two years ago and has now been snapped up by a buyer who does not currently live in the area.

'Lively': At low tide, the water around the island ebbs away and it is surrounded by holidaymakers

Elderly: The couple insisted they were not leaving because of the revelry - which they said had been curbed by the council - but because the swaying bridge and slippery steps made their home hard to access

The Longs bought it for £500,000 as a holiday home in 2001, and 
loved it so much they stayed. They believe it will continue to be used as a family home.

Towan - once said to be the world’s smallest inhabited isle - is completely surrounded by water at high tide, offering spectacular views on all sides.

But the couple soon found themselves at odds with Newquay's famous party 
culture, which sees drunken revellers having public sex and people taking drugs on the beach.

Lady Helen Long has spent years 
campaigning against the hundreds of revellers who hold 
parties on beaches at the foot of the 80ft rock.

Towan Beach is a mecca for stag and hen 
dos and Lady Long once threatened to sue the local council for not doing 
enough to stop the late-night celebrations.

Lady Long wrote to Restormel Borough Council to 
complain about the parties in summer 2003 - during which there were two reported rapes in one week.

Sad farewell: Lord and Lady Long say they growing old and can no longer negotiate the slippery steps and swaying bridge

Crackdown: Lady Helen Long wrote a four-page letter to the council insisting that the mayhem had to stop

She had earlier asked the authority if 
she could extend the bungalow so she could build a quieter bedroom 
facing away from the beach, but had been refused.

In a four-page letter, Lady Long - whose husband was a Tory whip
in the Thatcher and Major years - told the 
council that it had a duty to bring the mayhem on the beach to an end.

Many in the town were shocked by the 
negative publicity but others agreed with the Longs and formed the 
Newquay Action Group to get the place cleaned up.

Lady Long said: 'We are not moving 
because of any problems with the beach. These have been sorted out and 
have largely been stopped.

'It has changed out of all recognition 
since 2003. It is now illegal to start bonfires on the beach, sell 
alcohol or for excessive numbers to congregate there at night.

View of the beach: In the early 2000s, the beach used to be the home of much partying, where naked revellers would run squealing into the surf, bonfires would be lit and couples would have sex in public

Life in the sun: The Longs say they understand the house will remain a family home

'Putting a stop to it has done Newquay a
huge amount of good. The reason we’re moving is because the steps 
leading to the house are very uneven and slippery.'

The couple put the house on the market after 83-year-old Richard began finding the granite steps either side of the swaying Edwardian bridge too much.

They have now sold their 1930s, three-bedroom home - one of the most photographed in the country - and are due to move out on Friday November 30.

Lady Long says the move is down to the home being difficult to access for her 83-year-old husband Richard.

She said: 'It has been a wonderful place to live. The view is absolutely fantastic and it’s a fun house to live in.

Keen for privacy? This is the view across the 100ft long suspension bridge which sits 90ft off the ground. The path has become hard for the elderly couple to negotiate

Uplifting sight: The picturesque house is said to be one of the most photographed in the country

'It’s also been very nice meeting people in the community. I understand it will remain a family home. It’s certainly not being sold for anything else.

'It’s difficult for my husband to carry things up and down. It’s getting too much for him now.

'We’re moving somewhere where we can drive up to the door. As of yet we haven’t found anywhere that fits the bill.

'But anyone thinking of moving here must understand it is a lively place. We are certainly not prudes.'

Lady Long once applied to the Guinness Book of Records to have Towan Island, has less than 50 residents, officially recognised as the world’s smallest island.

But officials ruled it does not qualify because it is technically an outcrop.
