Police say a Pennsylvania veteran who was hearing voices in his head killed a pastor because he thought the clergyman was possessed by demons.

Authorities say 38-year-old Roland Zinneh went to the home of a woman named Precious where Connery Dagadu was staying on Tuesday night and asked the pastor to pray with him about the voices he was hearing.
