Vigil: Family members, friends and students are pictured mourning during the service at Capistrano on Sunday. Alex and Matthew were both ninth-graders at the school in Mission Viejo, where they also played football

Speaking through tears, one female pupils said: 'I love them I’ll always keep them in my heart.' Another student added: 'I’m going to miss them, a lot.'

The three male victims, from Mission Viejo, were identified by their soccer coach, who realized something had gone wrong when they failed to turn up for Saturday morning's game.

Billy McNicoll told how Alex, his team's top goal-scorer, and Matt were well-established players, while Brandon was a newer addition. Their loss hit the team hard.

Speaking to the LA Times, he said: 'These are good boys. We are devastated. Just devastated.'

Candles: Both of the girls and one of the boys were not wearing seat belts, the California Highway Patrol said

The soccer team canceled all of its games for the weekend as players and their relatives came to terms with the boys' deaths.

Alex and Matthew were ninth-graders at Capistrano Valley High School in Mission Viejo, while Brandon was in the eighth grade at Carl Hankey Middle School in the same town.

One female student at Capistrano, which held a candlelight vigil with around 4,000 attendees on Sunday, said: 'I'm just feeling so, just so bad, and just asking God, "Why is this happening?".'

Matthew's father, Ivan Melo, wore his son's cleats around his neck to the vigil, as well as a medal from a soccer tournament. He told ABC 7: 'Never thought or crossed my mind that this would ever happen, you know, it should've never happened.'

Theme park: The teenagers were on their way back from the Knott's Scary Farm event (pictured)

Bradley, who was either ejected from the car or climbed out after it stopped, lost control of the vehicle as it was headed south, just north of Alton Parkway, back toward Mission Viejo. 

Under Californian law, drivers younger than 17-and-a-half are not allowed on the road between 11pm and 5am, or to carry passengers under 20.

Investigators are still looking in to what exactly may have caused the crash. They are inspecting the 1995 BMW for signs of mechanical failure that might have contributed to the incident.

It has also been suggested that speed was a factor based on skid marks the freeway and the distance that the car traveled after hitting the guardrail. Drugs and alcohol were not involved.
