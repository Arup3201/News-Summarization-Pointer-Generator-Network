One could say that the owners are surely getting more fun out of this than their pets.

Dogs are having ‘temporary tattoos’ such as paws, snowflakes and love hearts cut into their fur, with the designs taking about an hour to shave using clippers and lasting around 14 weeks.

Groomers Jessica Allegri, 26, and Amanda Marshall, 29, of Hatfield, Hertfordshire, came up with the idea for 'pooch patches' after trying it on their own boxer Ky, and have since been inundated with customers.

‘It was a quiet day and we thought it would be fun to shave a paw print on my dog, who comes to work with me,’ Ms Allegri said.

‘Our customers were really impressed and asked where he had had it done. Since then we have had lots of people asking for pooch patches and we've done snowflakes, flowers and hearts.

‘One woman even wanted a One Direction symbol shaved onto her dog for her daughter. For the dogs it's just like having a hair-cut and doesn't hurt.'

The pair, who run Groomers on the 
Green in Hatfield, are now trademarking and patenting the popular treatment. They 
opened the store in April 2011 after having both worked in kennels.
