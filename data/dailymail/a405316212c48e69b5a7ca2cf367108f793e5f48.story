Attorney General Eric Holder said Tuesday that his Department of Justice will focus on a 'bias reduction and procedural fairness' program in the wake of mob riots touched off when a grand jury refused to indict a white police officer for the self-defense killing of a black 18-year-old who had attacked him.

The DOJ, Holder said during a six-minute speech, has two separate investigations underway – one into the August 9 shooting of Michael Brown at the hands of Ferguson, Missouri policeman Darren Wilson, and another into the Ferguson Police Department. 

'The department's investigations will continue to be thorough, they will continue to be independent, and they remain ongoing,' he said. 'They will be conducted rigorously and in a timely manner.'

Following a night of flame-engulfed stores, looted inventories and first-responders fleeing gunfire, Holder said his agency's chief goal would be to 'restore trust, to rebuild understanding and to restore cooperation between law enforcement and community members.'

TWO INVESTIGATIONS: Holder said the DOJ is investigating both the August 9 shooting of Michael Brown and the Ferguson Police Department's handling of the case, hinting that hsi agency is looking for evidence of racial bias

'Disappointed': A restrained Holder spoke Tuesday about anti-race-bias efforts but had no harsh condemnation for rioters and looters

The shooting, he declared, 'has revealed, I think, a deep distrust between some in the Ferguson community and its police force.'

Holder said five hours of lawlessness left him 'disappointed that some members of the community resorted to violence rather than respecting what I felt were the truly heartfelt words of Michael Brown, Sr. and the wishes that he expressed about how he wanted his son's memory to be honored – with nonviolence.'

The elder Brown had said Monday afternoon as a grand jury decision seemed near that he wanted his son's death 'to lead to incredible change, positive change, change that makes the St. Louis region better for everyone.' 

'Hurting others or destroying property is not the answer,' he said.

Brown, along with the slain teen's stepfather Lesley McSpadden, issued a statement after the 'no-bill' decision was returned. 

''While we understand that many others share our pain, we ask that you channel your frustration in ways that will make a positive change,' they said. 

'We respectfully ask that you please keep your protests peaceful,' the two added, while asking for a renewed emphasis on the need for law enforcement officers to have body-worn cameras while on patrol.

'Answering violence with violence is not the appropriate reaction,' they said.

But hours earlier McSpadden was videotaped towering above a sea of protesters as they realized Wilson would not face prosecution.

'Burn this b***h down!' he shouted multiple times.

Holder did not mention that remark.

On Air Force One, White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz told reporters Tuesday afternoon en route to Chicago that President Barack Obama and his aides 'are all deeply worried and disappointed – and concerned
about the violence, any sort of violence, and that's why the
president went out and spoke about it last night.'

Obama's nine minutes of remarks were played nationally on cable news channels whose split-screen broadcasts juxtaposed his plea for calm with real-time pictures of a city in flames.

But 'again I would remind you,' Schultz said, 'the vast majority of protests in
Missouri and around the country were peaceful and constructive.' 

CHAOS: Ferguson, Missouri became a war zone on Monday night as angry protesters fired shots, set fires, destroyed police cars and looted businesses all night

'A NATION OF COWARDS': Holder famously rendered that judgment about Americans' attitudes toward race, and the Ferguson shooting has put inner-city racial animus back on the front burner

In Washington, Holder pledged to work toward 'isolating the criminal element from peaceful protesters' in Ferguson and in other communities where African-Americans believe largely-white police forces are stacked against them.

'The reality is that what we see in Ferguson is not restricted to Ferguson,' he said. 'There are other communities around the country that have these same issues that have to be dealt with.'

Holder also praised Ferguson residents who risked their lives to intervene in attempts to stop looters and arsonists on Monday.

They 'are in fact heroes, to my mind,' he said.

He also plugged the DOJ's 'Building Communities of Trust' program, a new effort aiming for 'bias reduction and procedural fairness' in police departments nationwide.

'Our focus will be national in scope and appeal,' he pledged.

Eric Holder, the outgoing US attorney general, sidestepped lingering questions about whether Michael Brown's stepfather set off a night of arson and looting with his 'burn this b***h down!' screams

@highlight

Instead he praised the late Brown's father, who pleaded for calm and said he wanted his son honored with nonviolent protests

@highlight

Holder said he was 'disappointed' in violent protesters and praised 'heroes' who tried to intervene when rioters set fires and attacked police

@highlight

Added that Department of Justice is focusing on 'bias reduction and procedural fairness' in the wake of August's deadly shooting

@highlight

His only mention of the Ferguson police force was a reminder that the DOJ is investigating it 'rigorously'
