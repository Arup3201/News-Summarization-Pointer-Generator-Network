Pauline Chai told the High Court her vast shoe collection was proof the UK was her home

The billionaire chairman of retail giant Laura Ashley has insisted that his wife could not possibly own 1,000 pairs of shoes during their bitter £400million divorce battle.

Khoo Kay Peng, 75, said that he was 'shocked' by his wife Pauline Chai's claim - which she offered in court earlier this month as proof that she considers the UK her permanent home.

The Malaysian couple are currently fighting at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London over whether a final separation trial should be held in England or Malaysia. 

She wants the matter settled in the UK, where she is likely to receive a more generous divorce settlement.

And to convince a judge to make the jurisdiction ruling in her favour - she claimed that keeping more than 1,000 pairs of shoes in her sprawling Hertfordshire estate meant the country mansion was her permanent home.

But Dr Khoo, who is based in Malaysia, suggested to Mr Justice Bodey via video link that his wife owned no more than 40 pairs of shoes.

He said the last person he remembered owning 1,000 pairs was Imelda Marcos - the widow of former Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos.

He said: 'When I read the newspaper I was very, very surprised and shocked. How are you going to wear 1,000 pair of shoes?

'I really don't know how many pairs of shoes she has got. A wild guess, I would tell you about 20, 30, 40. 

'I could be wrong, because I don't know what she buys, because she loves shopping. She shops all over the place.

'The last time I read of 1,000 pair of shoes, I don't know if you remember Imelda Marcos?

He went on: 'Collection? I thought you only collected things that would appreciate in value, not things that go down in value.'

And he told the judge: 'I don't have a lot of shoes. I buy what I need.'

The businessman married former beauty queen Pauline Chai in 1970 and the couple have five children.

He told Mr Justice Bodey that he had been 'surprised and shocked' when Ms Chai - who was crowned Miss Malaysia in 1969 - filed for divorce.

Dr Khoo says their marital home was in Malaysia and he wants a judge in Malaysia to make decisions about the division of money.

Dr Khoo, speaking in court today via from Malaysia via video link, insisted his wife could not possibly own 1,000 pairs of shoes, his former wife sported navy courts with a silver heel speaking at court this month

He claims Ms Chai wants to fight in England because an English court will give her a more generous award.

Ms Chai says they moved to their home to Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, before separating last year, and she wants decisions made in an English court.

And she says Dr Khoo is making a 'desperate attempt' to avoid fighting over money in an English court.

She estimates that Dr Khoo is worth at least £441 million and says his income is at least £5.4 million a year.

Ms Chai, pictured feeding pet alpacas on her Hertfordshire estate, also said her husband had been 'abusive'

She also says he has failed to give a 'proper account' of his assets - but But Dr Khoo today insisted the £440m figure was 'far, far too high'.

A recent survey from money saving website VoucherCodesPro.co.uk polled 2,352 women aged 18 and over from across the UK. They found:

His wife has previously claimed that she would be at a 'huge disadvantage' if she had to fight in Malaysia.

Richard Todd QC, for Ms Chai, said she lived on a 'beautiful English estate', had a taste for English TV shows and valued what was 'quintessentially' English.

He told Mr Justice Bodey that she was fulfilling a 'legitimate desire to be here'. 

Mr Justice Bodey is expected to make rulings on jurisdiction after hearing legal argument and evidence from both sides. 

The divorce battle began after their marriage hit the rocks last year, four years after buying their lavish Hertfordshire property.

Ms Chai has told Mr Justice Bodey that she needed to get out of the 'abusive' marriage.

She said: 'I just wanted to get away from an abusive, oppressive relationship which I could not take because of my age.

'When I was younger I could recover. Now it was too difficult to overcome it because of the violence and the fear he was putting on me.

'The reason I wanted freedom from him was because he was getting violent and I was very fearful.'

In the High Court today, Dr Khoo said that the only person he knew to own more than 1,000 pairs of shoes was Imelda Marcos. 

The 85-year-old widow of former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos is famous for her astonishing collection of shoes.

The collection, once said to be in the region of 3,000 pairs, including top U.S. and European brands, astounded the world and became a symbol of excess in the Southeast Asian nation, where many still walked barefoot out of abject poverty.

Imelda Marcos claimed many of the shoes were gifts from Filipino shoemakers in suburban Marikina city, the country's shoemaking capital, for endorsing their products.
