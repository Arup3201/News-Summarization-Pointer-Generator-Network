A condemned Ohio killer gasped, snorted and snored during a prolonged execution using a controversial, never-before-tried lethal injection this morning.

Death row inmate Dennis McGuire took 15 minutes to die by the two-drug combination, a method adopted after
 supplies of the state's previous drug dried up, and declared that he was going to Heaven before succumbing to the cocktail.

'I'm going to heaven, I'll see you there when you come,' he said in the small, windowless room in the Lucasville correctional facility. He was pronounced dead at 10:53 a.m., after one of the longest executions since Ohio resumed capital punishment in 1999.

The 53-year-old's attorneys had argued against using intravenous doses
 of the sedative midazolam and the painkiller hydromorphone, claiming the combination would cause 'air hunger' - where someone experiences immense terror and agony as they strain for breath during the execution.

McGuire's snorts and gasps, and prolonged death, suggest he may have indeed suffered the medical phenomenon and could prompt Ohio officials to review using the drug cocktail.

Previous executions with the former 
execution drugs took much less time, and typically did not include the loud sounds that McGuire uttered.

McGuire thanked his 22-year-old 
victim's family for a letter he received from them, referring to 'kind 
words' that meant a lot. Joy Stewart's sister Carol Avery wrote in the 
note that she had forgiven him but also insisted 'it is time - past time
 - for him to pay for what he did to my sister.'

He opened and shut his hands as if waving to his adult son, 
daughter and daughter-in-law sitting a few feet away and a full minute 
later he stood up and told them, 'I love you, I love you.'

He was then still for five minutes before 
emitting a loud snort as if snoring and continued to make this noise for several minutes. His stomach rose and fell several times as 
he repeatedly opened and shut his mouth, making what the Columbus Dispatch described as 'deep, rattling sounds.'

His family sobbed as they watched him slowly die. At one point, his 
daughter exclaimed 'Oh my God' as she observed her father's final moments.

A coughing sound was Dennis McGuire's last apparent movement, at 10:43 a.m. He was pronounced dead 10 minutes later. McGuire as first injected with the drugs at 10:29 a.m.

McGuire's last meal yesterday consisted of roast beef, a 
cream cheese bagel, fried chicken, potatoes two ways, butter pecan ice 
cream and Coca-Cola. He skipped a shower and breakfast this morning
 and had a final visit with his children before the scheduled execution.

On Wednesday, he
 arrived calmly at the death house and spent the night writing letters, phoning his 
mother and sister and visiting with his son and daughter.

McGuire's attorneys had warned the convicted rapist and murderer would likely 
suffer from air hunger, which sees a person 
experience immense pain and terror as they strain to catch their breath 
before they die. They argued sentencing him to this manner of death was 
unconstitutionally 
cruel.

Experimental: McGuire was executed at this facility by Ohio's untested execution method

Punishment: The death chamber at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville. Ohio used intravenous doses of two drugs, midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a painkiller, to put McGuire to death

Ohio has begun using lethal doses of the sedative midazolam and the painkiller hydropmorphone after the European manufacturer of the previous drug, pentobarbital, stopped allowing its use in lethal injections.

Marketed in English-speaking countries and Mexico under the trade names Dormicum, Hypnovel, and Versed, midazolam is a short-acting sedative in the benzodiazepine class of drugs developed by Hoffmann-La Roche in the 1970s. 

The drug is used for treatment of acute seizures, moderate to severe insomnia, and for inducing sedation and amnesia before medical procedures. It possesses profoundly potent anxiolytic, amnestic, hypnotic, anticonvulsant, skeletal muscle relaxant, and sedative properties.

Hydromorphone is a very potent centrally acting analgesic drug of the opioid class. It is a derivative of morphine.

An expert in Dennis McGuire's case claimed the two drugs together in lethal doses would very likely cause what's known as 'air hunger' or simply an acute shortness of breath.

The clinical definition of air hunger or dyspnea is an uncomfortable awareness of one's breathing effort. It is a normal symptom of heavy exertion but becomes pathological if it occurs in unexpected situations.

Reports from McGuire's death chamber suggest this may have in fact occurred.

As such, the appropriateness of the drugs, and the extent to which they may be cruel, will likely be reviewed by Ohio officials before they are used in another execution.

Ohio officials used intravenous doses
 of the sedative midazolam and the painkiller hydromorphone to put 
McGuire to death. The method has been part of Ohio's execution process 
since 2009, though never used until now.

The state presented evidence from its own 
expert disputing the air hunger scenario, and saying McGuire waited far 
too long to file the appeal, which came earlier this month.

A federal judge sided with the state and gave the green light for the execution to proceed.

At the request of McGuire's lawyers, 
Judge Gregory Frost on Wednesday also ordered the state to photograph 
and then preserve the drugs' packaging boxes and vials and the syringes 
used in the execution.

Richard Dieter, executive director of
 the anti-capital punishment Death Penalty Information Center, told NBC 
News after the execution that McGuire's gasps may lead the state or the 
courts to rethink the new drug combination.

'This
 doesn’t sound like it was a complete disaster but they don't want 
anything that even has the appearance of someone suffering or a delay in
 death being carried out,' Dieter said. 'This is going to be looked at 
with good concern.'

It is 
not unheard of for an execution to take 15 minutes or even longer, but 
Dieter told the network that if the prisoner was physically struggling 
much of that time, it could be seen as cruel.

'This sounds like more discomfort than they would want in carrying out an execution,' he said.

The
 U.S. Supreme Court rejected a last-minute request to delay McGuire's 
execution on the grounds that a jury never got to hear the full extent 
of his chaotic and abusive childhood. The court's denial Wednesday 
included no explanation.

McGuire was sentenced to die for the 1989 rape and fatal stabbing of Joy Stewart in Preble County in western Ohio.

Stewart's
 slaying went unsolved for 10 months until McGuire, jailed on an 
unrelated assault and hoping to improve his legal situation, told 
investigators he had information about the woman's February 12, 1989, 
death.

His attempts to blame the crime on 
his brother-in-law quickly unraveled and soon he was accused of being 
Stewart's killer, according to prosecutors.

More
 than a decade later, DNA evidence confirmed McGuire's guilt, and he 
acknowledged that he was responsible in a letter to Governor John Kasich
 last month.

'One can scarcely conceive of a 
sequence of crimes more shocking to the conscience or to moral 
sensibilities than the senseless kidnapping and rape of a young, 
pregnant woman followed by her murder,' Preble County prosecutors said 
in a filing with the state parole board last month.

His attorneys argued McGuire was mentally, physically and sexually abused as a child and had impaired brain function that made him prone to act impulsively.

'Dennis was at risk from the moment he was born,' the lawyers said in a parole board filing. 'The lack of proper nutrition, chaotic home environment, abuse, lack of positive supervision and lack of positive role models all affected Dennis' brain development.'

Documents obtained by The Associated Press show McGuire unsuccessfully sought a reprieve in recent weeks to try to become an organ donor. In November, Kasich granted a death row inmate an eight-month reprieve to let the prison system study his request to donate a kidney to his sister and his heart to his mother.

Kasich said McGuire couldn't identify a family member who would receive his organs, as required under prison policy.

Ohio lost its previous execution drug when the manufacturer put it off limits for capital punishment.

Tragic: In the letter Joy's sister wrote, she described her 10-years-younger, adopted sister as the light of her family's life

In the letter Joy's sister wrote, she described her 10-years-younger, adopted sister as the light of her family's life.

'She was born Christmas Day, 1966 but I haven't spoken to her in more than 24 years. Her voice was silenced on February 11, 1989 when Dennis McGuire brutally ended her life.'

Avery said the soon-to-be mom was excited about the birth of her baby boy, who tragically died too the day of the murder.

'She never got to realize her dreams, never got to hold her baby boy in her arms, never got to kiss his soft cheek, never got to see him smile,' she wrote.

Avery described how the grief following Joy's murder destroyed her parents.

'They never fully recovered and both died knowing that her killer still lived,' she said.

Regarding the contentious lethal injection McGuire was given, Avery wrote: 'There has been a lot of controversy regarding the drugs that are to be used in his execution, concern that he might feel terror, that he might suffer.

'As I recall the events preceding her death; forcing her from the car, attempting to rape her vaginally, sodomizing her, choking her, stabbing her, leaving her to bleed out: I know she suffered terror and pain.

'He is being treated far more humanely than he treated her.'
