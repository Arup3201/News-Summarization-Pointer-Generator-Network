A 'Lovejoy' style gang of antique dealers has admitted conspiring to handle 'historically important' antiques worth £5 million which were stolen from country estates and hidden in their homes.

Carl Rutter 46, of Wakefield, West Yorkshire, was described by officers as 'a significant conspirator', the Yorkshire and Humber Regional Organised Crime Unit said.

He pleaded guilty at Leeds Crown Court today conspiring to handle the items and will be sentenced with two other men in about four weeks, the unit added.

The valuables, reported stolen from country halls, including Sion Hill Hall (pictured) included a pair of Louis XVI vases valued at almost £1 million

The valuables, reported stolen from 
country halls and estates in North Yorkshire and Sussex, included a pair
of Louis XVI vases valued at almost £1 million and a Chippendale table 
worth around £500,000, according to officers.

A Crime Unit spokesman said: 'He had 
overall possession of a number of the stolen antiques which had been 
stored on his behalf with a view to being sold later.'

Darren Webster, 45, of Leeds, and 
Brian Eaton, 69, of Barnsley, appeared in court in August charged with 
the same offences, the spokesman added.

Both pleaded guilty but have been awaiting sentence subject to the outcome of Rutter’s appearance in court today.

'Both Eaton and Webster also had 
possession of a large number of the antiques, some stored at Eaton’s 
home address,' the spokesman said.

Some of the 14 items recovered from the gang members' homes, were those previously reported as stolen from Newby Hall, North Yorkshire (pictured)

Webster was described by officers as 
the ‘lead conspirator’ while Eaton was responsible for introducing 
prospective buyers of the antiques to Webster and Rutter.

The antiques included a 
£500,000 George III Pembroke Chippendale drop leaf table, a pair of 
Louis XVI bleu nouveau ground vases and bases known as ' The Firle Vases ' 
valued at £950,000.

The items also included  a Sevres blue and rose marbled ground vase which was valued at £180,000, alongside various other items.

'The valuables, known to be of 
significant and cultural historic value and worth a total of £5 million,
were recovered by officers from the Yorkshire and Humber Regional 
Organised Crime Unit on September 22, 2011.

'It marked the culmination of a 
year-long investigation carried out by the ROCU who received significant
support from West Yorkshire Police and officers from the Regional Roads
Crime Team, North Yorkshire Police and South Yorkshire Police.'

The 14 items, recovered from Eaton 
and Webster’s homes, were those previously reported as stolen from Newby
Hall and Sion Hill in North Yorkshire and Firle Place in Sussex, police
said, adding that they have been returned.

Detective Superintendent Steve Waite,
head of regional intelligence, said: 'We were immensely pleased and 
proud back in September 2011 to have recovered these high value antiques
which were described as true pieces of British heritage.

'Today’s plea brings this absolutely 
fantastic case one step closer to its conclusion. It’s a great result 
for both the officers involved and the stately homes that were affected 
by these thefts.'

Lovejoy was a popular TV series about a roguish antiques dealer who often found himself on the wrong side of the law.
