She said I could: John Grant Tasered his wife several times after she lost a bet about the winner of Monday night's nail biter Bears vs. Packers game

An Illinois man could spend up to six years in jail thanks to a Monday Night Football bet that ended with him repeatedly Tasering his wife.

John Grant was at a Wisconsin bar during the Bears-Packers game with his wife when they each wagered that if the other's team won, they'd be in for a shock.

Grant's Bears won 27-20 and he took his spoils by repeatedly Tasering wife Nicole. She would eventually call the police, landing Grant behind bars with a possible six-year sentence for carrying the weapon, which is illegal in Wisconsin without a permit.

Nicole Grant called the cops on her husband just after midnight early Tuesday.

She told dispatchers her husband had thrown their dog out of the semi-truck they were sharing as their home and then locked her out too.

Earlier that night, she said, her husband had Tasered her on the buttocks and leg when the Packers lost.

Nicole
told police she hadn't consented to the Tasering. But when police 
reviewed footage on her cell phone, they found her laughing with her 
arms up as her husband administered the shock.

'It seemed apparent that Ms. Grant had consented,' reads the Mayville Police Department's report obtained by the Smoking Gun.

As Nicole waited in the squad car, Grant consented to a search of their truck and police found a stun gun.

Crying wolf? The Bears-Packers game was close one and ended with a 27-20 win for Grant's team, the Bears. He shocked his wife Nicole and after a subsequent fight, she called the cops complaining that she hadn't consented

Both of them consented to breathalyzers and were determined to be well over the limit of intoxication.

The
looselipped Grant told police, without their asking, that they'd gotten
into a fight not because she'd been smoking marijuana in the bathroom 
at the sports bar.

His wife, Grant told the police, smoked too much of the stuff and it hinders her from keeping a job.

While police had determined that no domestic violence was involved, they still needed to address the stun gun.

Grant did not have the required permit for the weapon, an offense that could earn him up to 6 years in jail.

And after all that, Nicole Grant declined to even press charges against her husband.

Oops: Though police determined that no domestic violence had occurred, Grant had another problem. He consented to a search of the truck the couple live in and police found a stun gun. Grant had no license, which means up to 6 years in jail in Wisconsin
