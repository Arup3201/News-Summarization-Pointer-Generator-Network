A judge yesterday warned of the ‘utterly destructive’ effects of drug abuse on families after hearing how billionaire Hans Rausing hid his dead wife’s body for more than two months.

Judge Richard McGregor-Johnson said the Tetra Pak heir had enjoyed ‘every material advantage imaginable’ before throwing it all away on addiction to hard drugs and descending into a life of squalor.

After Rausing’s wife Eva died, he  kept her decomposing corpse under  a pile of bin bags, bed sheets and  clothing several feet deep inside a locked annexe in the couple’s £70million Chelsea mansion, where they lived as virtual recluses.

'Breakdown': Hans Rausing was convicted today at Isleworth Crown Court of preventing his wife's burial and driving under the influence of drugs

He acted with ‘deceit and deliberation’ to prolong the concealment of the mother of his four children, using deodorant to try to disguise the stench and telling people that she was on a trip to America, Isleworth Crown Court was told.

But he escaped jail after the court heard that Rausing’s drug abuse meant he had been unable to confront the reality of his ‘beloved’ wife’s death.

The 49-year-old, whose family is the 12th richest in Britain and whose fortune comes from the £4.5billion Tetra Pak drinks carton empire, told psychiatrists after his arrest: ‘I know it is sad and selfish, but I just didn’t want her to leave.’

He cut a tragic figure as he stood in the dock to plead guilty to the common law offence of failing to prevent his 48-year-old wife’s lawful and decent burial.

Dressed in a navy blue blazer and red tie, he repeatedly blinked and twitched as Judge McGregor-Johnson gave him a ten-month suspended sentence on the condition that he agreed to a ‘very demanding’ drug rehabilitation programme.

'Decomposing': Rausing kept the body of his wife Eva, right, under a makeshift rug of clothes and bin bags

The judge told Rausing: ‘If ever there
was an illustration of the utterly destructive effects of drug misuse 
on individuals and their families, it is to be found in the facts of 
this case.

‘You and your 
wife had every material advantage imaginable, and for a time a happy 
family life. Your relapse into the misuse of drugs, together with that 
of your wife, destroyed all that.

‘It
is graphically illustrated by the contrast between the rooms visitors 
saw, and the utter squalor of the rooms you really lived in.’

The court heard that Mrs Rausing was last seen alive on May 3 when she met her financial adviser and confided that she was ‘worried’ about her husband’s ‘chaotic lifestyle’.

Four days later her husband found her dead on the second floor ‘annexe’ of their central London mansion, which only the couple were allowed to enter.

Unable to cope with his loss, he hid her body for more than two months until July 9, when he was stopped by police after driving  erratically through morning rush hour traffic in Wandsworth, South London. Police who searched his car found a crack pipe, cannabis and white powder in the footwell of his Bristol Coupe and noticed his pupils were dilated and he was unsteady on his feet.

They also discovered some unopened 
letters to Mrs Rausing in the boot of the car. When asked about the 
letters, Rausing ‘welled up’ and claimed she had gone to California two 
weeks earlier.

Police became suspicious and went to search the home and were let in by staff.

James O’Connell, prosecuting, said: ‘They were hesitant to allow access to the second floor because part of the premises was an annexe which for some years access had not been allowed to anyone other than Mr Rausing and his wife.

‘They decided to force entry but when they were in a lift they noticed the stench of decomposition. They entered a room which had been sealed off with locks and gaffer-tape.’

The untidy room contained a pile of clothes and other linen on the floor concealing a body in ‘an advanced stage of decomposition’. Post-mortem tests indicated Mrs Rausing probably died on May 7.

Eva Rausing’s parents were in the room as police made the horrifying discovery of their daughter’s body, the court was told.

Tom and Nancy Kemeny  are 
understood to have rushed to the Georgian home after seeing police cars 
parked outside as officers searched inside.

Judge Richard McGregor-Johnson said
Rausing’s prolonged concealment of his wife’s body had already caused 
‘great concern’ among those anxious about her whereabouts.

He said this was compounded by the 
‘dreadful shock of discovery’ in  distressing circumstances ‘for those 
who had to uncover the body but especially for  your wife’s parents who 
were in the room when their daughter’s body was discovered’.

After his arrest, Rausing was transferred to the private Capio Nightingale psychiatric hospital in Marylebone were he later told police in a statement: ‘I fully understand that my beloved wife of 19 years is dead and I am devastated, particularly for my children, by her death.

‘I do not have a coherent recollection of events leading up to and since Eva’s death save to say I have never wished upon her or done her any harm. I did not supply her with drugs.

‘I don’t know what caused her death, I did not feel able to fully confront the reality of her death.

‘With the benefit of hindsight I did not act rationally. I tried to carry on as if her death had not happened, and batted away any enquiries about her. I also took measures to reduce the smell.

‘I believe in the period since Eva’s death I have suffered some sort of breakdown.’ Tests after his arrest showed that Rausing had cocaine, morphine, diazepam, tamazepam and nitrazopam in his body.

Alex Cameron, QC, who is David Cameron’s brother, said in mitigation that Rausing had no recollection at all about the first ten to 12 hours after his wife’s death.

He said: ‘He didn’t move the body, he described her as appearing quite restful.

‘He felt quite unable to face up to the fact that Eva had died and almost like a small child couldn’t face up to telling anyone else and so took steps to delay the moment of facing up to reality. In his own words, he acted in a cowardly fashion.’

Cocaine, opiates and amphetamines were found in the body of Mrs Rausing, who had an ongoing heart problem and had been fitted with a pacemaker, the court heard.

The judge said he accepted that she died of heart failure coupled with the effects of drugs, telling Rausing: ‘There is no evidence to suggest the involvement of anyone else, including you, in her death.’

Rausing also admitted driving under the influence of drugs, for which he was given a two-month sentence suspended for two years.

His family made their billions through the Tetra Pak empire, which was founded in 1944.

The Rausings exited the Tetra Laval Group in 1995 and waived all interests in the company at the time.

A single glass of champagne to toast the new millennium sent Hans and Eva Rausing spiralling back into a devastating addiction that was to cost them everything.

The couple had both struggled with drug abuse in their youth but had successfully fought it to form a ‘loving’ family before the fateful decision to raise a glass together at midnight on New Year’s Eve in 1999, the court heard.

Alex Cameron, QC, for Rausing, said his battle with addiction appeared to have started with his extraordinarily wealthy background as the heir to the £4.5billion Tetra Pak drinks carton empire.

He said: ‘Despite or perhaps because of the economic circumstances of  his upbringing the defendant had  unusually strong social anxiety, feelings of inferiority, tendencies to medicate by drug taking and he dealt with emotional conflict by denial.’

Adoring: The couple met in rehab in 1989 before marrying three years later. They spent many spells in rehab but also lived drug-free for a period

He became addicted to drugs while travelling in his early twenties and met his wife-to-be in rehab in 1989, when he was 26 and she was 25.

They married three years later and, with Mrs Rausing taking the lead, they managed to live drug-free for 11 years as they raised four children.

Mr Cameron said: ‘They plainly adored each other, they were a loving family and they were extremely down to earth people and nice to work for, their staff said.’

They were active philanthropists, with a charitable trust created by the couple giving away £2million to good causes every year since 1995.

The family also enjoyed an affluent lifestyle, spending much of their time in their 11-bedroom mansion in Barbados.

But Mr Cameron said: ‘Things started to go wrong around about the millennium when the total abstinence of rehab process was mildly loosened by Eva’s urge to have a glass of champagne on New Year’s Eve of 1999 to 2000.

‘Needless to say they both did and the addiction slowly and surely began to take hold again.’

They lost the support of groups helping them to stay clean, and descended back into drug dependency.

They struggled on until 2007 when another devastating blow to the family occurred. Details were not given in court, but it was described as ‘like the end of the world’ to Rausing.

Mr Cameron said: ‘From that moment on he has been effectively a recluse.’ He said Rausing spoke only to his wife as the pair barricaded themselves into the second floor ‘annexe’ of their 50-room Chelsea mansion and banned anyone from entering.

Mr Cameron said: ‘They were deeply ashamed by their situation and the thought of meeting people and explaining their situation was too much to bear.’

He added: ‘The reaction of Eva Rausing’s parents has been laudably understanding, forgiving and supportive.

‘Tom Kemeny [her father] described the defendant as a wonderful father, a wonderful man, a very good person, but also very ill.’
