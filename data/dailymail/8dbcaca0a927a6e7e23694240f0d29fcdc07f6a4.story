Farrah Abraham has admitted that her sex tape was in fact a professionally shot pornographic video.

The troubled Teen Mom star initially denied involvement in the film but has since said she is willing to sell it for a couple million dollars.

The 21-year-old was apparently 
attempting to pass off the adult production as a leaked video of her and
 porn actor James Deen engaged in a private documentation not intended for the public.

Confession: Farrah Abraham admitted that the sex tape was a professional pornographic film, pictured in New York, in December

But the ruse was exposed when Farrah was spotted leaving porn company Vivid Entertainment holding hands with Deen, on Sunday.

When asked about the video, Farrah's 27-year-old co-star was more than willing to admit that the whole thing was a scam.

The professional porn director and actor told TMZ that the supposed sex tape was a 'setup'.

Deen explained:'I
think what happened is that [the porn company was] going to pass it off
as a sex tape and somebody saw us coming out of a building together and
people asked me what's going on.

'So I was like, "We're making a porno!"'

Deen would not confirm whether or not the porn company was in fact Vivid Entertainment.

The man in question: Porn star James Deen said the video was a 'setup', pictured at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles, in November

Farrah, who has a four-year-old daughter
Sofia, appeared to feign surprise when asked about the existence of the tape on Monday, 
muttering: 'I don't... exist... anything about that.'

She later added: 'If I had my own personal stuff, that's my own personal thing.'

But according to Deen: 'Everybody's trying to make it this story, but really [Farrah] wanted to make a sex tape.'

On Wednesday, Farrah finally conceded that the video was in fact scripted and shot by professionals.

She told TMZ that she made the tape in an effort to immortalize her youthful physique.

And the reality star still plans on selling the movie 'for [nothing] less than a couple million.'

Since the con was initially exposed by Deen, the young mother said she now wants nothing to do with her co-star.

She told TMZ: 'If my ex-boyfriend Derek [who died in a car accident in 2008] were alive, I would've rather it had been him with me.'

And the scandal prone television star took to Twitter to defend herself, on Tuesday: 'I 'm going to ignore all the lies, all the hate, all the disrespectful people who want 2 take advantage of me, have fun making money off me.'

Difficult relationship: Farrah with her mother Debra Danielson on MTV

But Farrah's mother Debra Danielsen does not believe her daughter would be involved in such a scandal.

Debra told TMZ, on Tuesday: 'My daughter has never expressed interest in things like that,' referring to the sex tape.  

'She was not brought up that way.'

The 57-year-old added: 'We have religious beliefs.'

While the grandmother may be a woman of faith, that did not stop her from allegedly choking and punching Farrah in the face.

The New York Daily News
reported, in January 2010, that Debra was arrested under suspicion of 
domestic abuse and assault against her then 18-year-old daughter.

And on an episode of 16 & Pregnant, Debra was caught by MTV cameras hitting Farrah in the mouth during an argument in a car.
