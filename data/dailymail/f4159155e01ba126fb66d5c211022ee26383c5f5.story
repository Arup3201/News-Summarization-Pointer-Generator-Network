Two brothers have been charged with murdering a woman who disappeared on Christmas Eve.

Sameena Imam was last seen at about 4pm on December 24 at the wholesaler Costco in  Coventry where she worked,  West Midlands Police said. 

The 34-year-old's black BMW car was found by detectives 65 miles away in Luton, Bedfordshire on January 4.

Despite extensive searches,  no trace of Ms Iman could be found, known by many of her friends as Sam, who lived in Cardiff.

Three days later, Roger Cooper, 40, of Coventry, and David Cooper, 38, of Leicester, were arrested at their homes. They have been in custody since their arrest.

They were charged yesterday and searches of both their addresses have been carried out.

Police have also searched an area of grassland, a brook and a park in Leicester in an effort to find out what happened.

Detective Superintendent Mark Payne, of West Midlands Police, called the murder charges 'a significant development' in the case.

He added that his thoughts were with the family of Ms Imam.

The brothers are due to appear at Birmingham Crown Court to face the charges.
