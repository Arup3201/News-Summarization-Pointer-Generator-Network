His many decades of entertaining on stage and screen have earned Sir Bruce Forsyth a considerable fortune.

And with six children, nine grandchildren and three great-grandchildren, it's no surprise the entertainer, 87, wants to be able to share as much of the wealth with them as possible.

But while he may be known more for his light-hearted banter than political commentary, the former Strictly Come Dancing host has revealed his frustration at the amount that will be taken from his estate in inheritance tax, describing it as 'a bit over the top'.

Sir Bruce, who has a keen interest in politics and once revealed he tapes Prime Minister's Questions each week, also told the Radio Times: 'I think your inheritance should go to your children more than back to the country that you've lived in.

'I'm not saying you don't owe the country something, of course you owe your country a lot for living there all those years. But I think it can be a bit over the top.'

Sir Bruce's company, Bruce Forsyth Enterprises, is worth £5.7million and he lives in a house near London worth an estimated £4million.

His estate would be exempt from inheritance tax if he leaves everything to his third wife, former Miss World Wilnelia Merced, 57, who is the mother of his only son, JJ.

The entertainer had three daughters – Debbie, Julie and Laura – with his first wife Penny Calvert, a former dancer with whom he split in 1973. That year, Sir Bruce married Anthea Redfern, his hostess on The Generation Game.

The couple had two daughters, Charlotte and Louisa, but their six-year marriage ended following allegations of infidelity.

In the interview, Sir Bruce declined to say which political party he supports. But he described David Cameron as 'the most pleasant man' who has 'done a good job'.

He also used the interview to hit out at reality TV, saying he was tired of the format.

He said: 'I have had enough of it. I don't know how long it's been going on but it's probably well over 10 years.'

He added: 'I'd like to see performers playing together, having fun together, entertaining together, instead of this thing that we're caught up in.' 

Sir Bruce quit Strictly - although he still presents one-off specials - after 11 series and a decade in the job.

'I was beginning to feel a bit stale. It's an awful thing to feel as a performer, that you're not enjoying it as much as you should do and you're not giving as much as you could,' he said.

He said of the show's rival, The X Factor: 'I don't watch it because they have singer after singer after singer after singer... and then, after that, they have another singer.

'That, to me, isn't entertainment. It's a very good show, it's produced very, very well and I'm all for giving young people a chance to become big names, but I want more in two hours of entertainment than only singing.' 

The veteran star is returning to the stage - the London Palladium - with his one man show as part of a three-leg tour in the spring.

Asked if going on stage felt better than sex, he replied: 'Well, it's pretty close.'

Sir Bruce, who has vowed not to retire, also gave his thoughts on death, saying: 'As I get nearer to it I fear it less because with the tiredness one gets at times, you think, 'Is it just like having a nice long sleep?' I wouldn't say I fear it.

'I think I'll be completely at peace when it does happen to me because I've been so lucky. I've had a wonderful career.' 

And he said on immigration: 'It should benefit the country, whatever decision is made. It needs sorting out.'
