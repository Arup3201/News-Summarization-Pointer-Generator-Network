A 34-year-old Julliard graduate leaped to her death from a 16th floor Manhattan apartment Thursday and in the process very nearly took a man passing by on the street below down with her.

Samantha Cohn, who made a living as a Pilates instructor, took her own life around 10am.

Seconds earlier, 59-year-old Matt Kovary passed by the very spot where the brunette beauty's body slammed into the sidewalk along Broadway.

'I thank God for sparing me because I would be dead too,' Kovary told the New York Post. 'I heard a loud explosion. It was right behind me.'

There lay Cohn, who witnesses said was wearing her workout clothes, dead and crumpled in a pile.

'The sight was so horrific. She was just at my feet. She almost took me with her,' Kovary said.

Cohn's suicide reportedly came after some recent bouts with mental health issues.

In April, the former dancer reportedly disappeared for a week.

'They found her in the hospital, supposedly for heat exhaustion,' doorman and witness Jacques Tassy told the Post. 'When she came back, she seemed different. She wasn’t smiling as much.'

A woman charged with checking in on the unwell woman from time to time arrived at the building just half an hour after the suicide and wept when she learned the victim was Cohn.

Kovary called the woman's death senseless: 'All she needed were friends or someone to talk to,' he told the Post.
