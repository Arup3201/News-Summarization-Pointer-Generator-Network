A desperate wife threw herself on to her bloodied husband to save his life as three thugs took turns kicking him in a 'stomach churning' attack.

Richard Weston, 47, was assaulted in the street, his face left ‘pulverised’, as the thugs set on him until they were 'too tired to kick any more'.

Dwayne Mears, 30, Lewis Downham, 24, and Shane Hurst, 24, were all jailed for the brutal attack which the judge at Lincoln Crown Court called the worst assault he had seen.

Mr Weston’s hysterical wife Tina, 50, 
tried to intervene ‘to save his life’ during the attack in Sutton 
Bridge, Lincolnshire, the court heard.

'Stomach churning attack': Dwayne Mears (left) and Lewis Downham (right) were jailed for two and a half years, and two years respectively for the attack on Richard Weston which left his face 'pulverised.'

Shown remorse: Shane Hurst, also jailed for the attack, was not the instigator and had shown remorse, his lawyer said in court

After punching Mr Weston to the ground the trio began booting him in the face and body and only stopped when one of them joked: ‘I can’t kick any more. I’m tired.’

Prosecutor David Outterside said the trio ‘seemed to be loving it’.

Jailing Mears for two and a half years, Downham for two and Hurst for 21 months, Judge Sean Morris said: ‘You pleaded guilty to one of the worst affrays it has been my misfortune to see. 

‘This was the most stomach churning attack. What happened on that night beggar’s belief.’

The trio pounced on Mr Weston as he walked home with his friend Dean Bunn and their wives after a night out.

Mr Outterside said they were approached by a group of up to eight men led by Downham.

He said: ‘Downham punched Dean Bunn to the head and as he went to the floor he was kicked and punched.

‘Richard Weston tried to intervene. The attacking group them turned their attention to him.

‘Dwayne Mears punched Mr Weston first and then the two co-accused joined in.

‘Mr Weston was knocked to the ground and was kicked while he lay unconscious on the ground.

‘They took it in turns to kick him. All were in it as much as each other.

‘Tina Weston threw herself on her husband to save his life and to stop them kicking him.

‘A bystander described them as laughing and joking throughout. They seemed to be loving it.

‘One of them, who has not been identified, after finishing kicking Mr Weston said “I can’t kick any more. I’m tired”.’

Worst ever seen: Judge Sean Morris told Lincoln Crown Court (pictured) that the attack was 'one of the worst affrays it has been my misfortune to see' in which Mr Weston's wife threw herself on her husband to save him

The attackers fled but were later arrested.

The three all pleaded guilty to affray and were sentenced on October 5.

Philip Farr, defending Mears, said he had a good work ethic and had been doing his best to stay out of trouble.

Vedrana Pehar, who represented Downham, said he had difficulty dealing with anger management, adding: ‘He describes himself as being ashamed of his actions.’

Lawrence Bruce, for Hurst, said he was not the instigator and has since shown remorse.
