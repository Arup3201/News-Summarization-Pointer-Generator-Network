Extremist preacher Omar Bakri Mohammad will not be allowed back into Britain, the Government has insisted amid reports he intends to claim asylum in the UK.

The radical Islamic cleric faces the death sentence for running a terror cell in Lebanon and claims he has been tortured, according to reports.

Family members have said they are launching an urgent appeal to allow him back into Britain under asylum laws but the Home Office has ruled out a return.

Bakri, who holds Syrian and Lebanese citizenship, lived in Britain for 20 years and led radical group Al Muhajiroun until it was disbanded.

He faced possible treason charges over his support for the London bombers in 2005 and fled Britain for Lebanon. The British Government barred him from returning.

At the time, he described the 7/7 bombers as the 'fantastic four', but left Britain fearing arrest.

Speaking to journalists in 2005 from Beirut, Bakri claimed he would never return to Britain as the government refused to accept his support of Osama Bin Laden and the need for jihad.

The cleric has been repeatedly linked with al Qaida but has denied the claims.

Earlier this year he went on the run after raids in Tripoli to end sectarian violence after clashes that left dozens dead.

A Home Office spokesman said: 'An individual must be physically present in the UK in order to make a claim for asylum.

'Omar Bakri Muhammad was permanently excluded from the UK in 2005 on the grounds that his presence is not conducive to the public good.

'As Omar Bakri Muhammad is excluded from the UK, he will be unable to make a claim for asylum.'

Lebanese security officials Bakri is the mastermind behind a terrorist cell based in Tripoli.

He has spent more than one month in custody and despite his regular denials of al Qaeda membership he has expressed public support for several of their affiliated groups.

Authorities in Lebanon believe Bakri is linked to Al Qaeda and is responsible for a series of attacks both on Army personnel in recent months and inciting sectarian fighting in Tripoli, which left 30 dead and over 160 wounded.

Omar Bakri, believed to be 54 now, was previously the London-based spiritual leader of the extremist group Al-Muhajiroun.

He lived in London where he was known as the Tottenham Ayatollah.

Bakri was under investigation by UK police after he called for young British Muslims to take up arms and join Al Qaeda.

On the London bombings it was also reported that Bakri referred to the four suicide bombers who killed 56 people on July 7 as 'the fantastic four'.

He said the British people were to blame for the terror attacks on the capital because they 'did not make enough effort to stop its own government committing its own atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan'.

Bakri, pictured, said Britain would continue to be at risk from jihadists while British troops remained in the middle east.

In March he told The Daily Mail when speaking of the troubles in Tripoli ‘only jihad salafi can save it and save Lebanon’.

He added: ‘This country needs to be made an Islamic state, obviously ... but I know the security services are getting ready to nab me soon’.

The radical Islamic cleric was under house arrest in Tripoli since Lebanese security forces released him from jail in 2010, after striking a deal with the Shia extremist group Hezbollah.

Bakri was sentenced to life following a terrorism conviction, but was released on bail after witnesses recanted their testimony.

If found guilty of the current charges against him in Lebanon though, Bakri will face the death sentence.
