It took 36 minutes for the first email to arrive. As the shockwaves from Rio de Janeiro were still reverberating, bookmakers began pumping out their blunt messages.

Assessing how much of an impact Luis Suarez's suspension would have on Liverpool's ambitions for the new Barclays Premier League campaign, the words in the subject box from odds compilers had no ambiguity. 'Reds pushed out for title glory,' they proclaimed. They were delivering a calculated summary of where Liverpool stand without Suarez: not credible contenders.

Good times: Luis Suarez was the Premier League Player of the Year last season but Liverpool could now sell

Brendan Rodgers, Liverpool's ambitious manager, would rail against that view. When it has been put to him in the past that his side were over-reliant on Suarez, he could list statistics and highlights to show why it wasn't just about this maverick soul from Salto.

He had a point, too. When Suarez served a 10-match ban for biting Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic in April 2013, Liverpool won seven times in all competitions, drew two and lost one. 

They were not short of goals, either, particularly from Daniel Sturridge.

The reality, however, is different. Suarez transforms Liverpool. His presence scrambles the minds of opponents, inspires those around him and last season he gave supporters that priceless belief that, no matter what, he would score and Liverpool would win. Do not underestimate his worth.

As it stands now, Suarez will miss the 
first nine Premier League matches and in the corresponding fixtures last
 year, his influence was enough to secure Rodgers 10 extra points - the 
difference, effectively, between finishing second and fourth.

Suarez brings out the best in Liverpool but what is best for Liverpool now should not include Suarez. That might sound contradictory, given what his 31 goals helped achieve in 2013-14, but if he remains on Merseyside while serving his ban, he will cast a heavy, uncomfortable cloud.

Say he is still a Liverpool player in October. With some tricky assignments - such as trips to Manchester City and Spurs, as well as the Merseyside derby - Liverpool could find themselves outside the top four, particularly if their Champions League schedule is complicated.

Questions to Rodgers then become about whether Liverpool can keep a player of his ability if they are not challenging for the honours he craves.

Put simply, Rodgers doesn't need it any more. The topic dominated last summer when Suarez was trying to engineer a move to Arsenal and Suarez's future was fast becoming an issue once more this month before his notoriety in Natal. 

Rodgers is trying to build Liverpool up into a position where they will not be one-season wonders; he wants the verve and the style and the winning sprees of last season's efforts to become normal. 

Having Suarez would obviously enhance their prospects but Suarez keeps letting Rodgers down.

Liverpool did everything they could to help Suarez last season, from letting him bring his newborn son, Benjamin, on to the pitch before a game last October to making him captain in Steven Gerrard's absence and ensuring Dr Steve Peters' counsel was available to him at all times.

In the main, it worked, but these latest events show he  cannot be trusted. As Jamie Carragher said in Sportsmail on Thursday, controversy will be just around the corner, waiting to trip Liverpool up -  so now is the time for ruthlessness.

If Rodgers is going to create a title-winning team, he needs reliability and stability as well as talent. He is not afraid to make big decisions - one of his first acts as Liverpool manager was to send £35million Andy Carroll out to West Ham on loan - but the biggest is looming.

Privately Rodgers may feel Suarez has reached the point where he causes more harm than good. If that is the case, a deal with Barcelona - who have not been put off by events in Brazil - should be done and the money used to make Liverpool stronger.

Should he be able to do that, life without Suarez need not be as bleak as the bookmakers forecast.
