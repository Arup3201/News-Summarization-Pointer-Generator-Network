Nap in the nave: The Archbishop of Canterbury has confessed to dozing off and falling sideways during evensong at Coventry Cathedral

It is not surprising that some people admit to dozing off in the middle of a long church service but there is one man you wouldn’t expect to own up to a quick snooze in the pews. 

The Archbishop of Canterbury has confessed that he nodded off and fell sideways during an evensong service.

The new spiritual leader of the world's 77 million Anglicans made the admission in his first major address since becoming archbishop at Coventry Cathedral, where he was once a canon.

The Most Rev Justin Welby revealed that when he was leading evensong at the cathedral he fell asleep during the singing of Magnificat before being spotted by the verger, who stifled his laughter, despite the archbishop’s attempts to conceal his nod off.

And this nap in the nave confession is not the first he has made.

He laughed through a passage from the Old Testament forbidding the eating of ‘rock badgers’ while he was the Dean of Liverpool.   

When he became Bishop of Durham he was presented with a crozier with the face of a rock badger, which resembles a prairie dog, carved into it as a reminder of the day he lost his composure.

The honest archbishop recently revealed that his ‘alcohol-dependent’ father had a secret life.

The former oil executive learned that his father Gavin Welby was briefly married during a stint living in America and while there had an affair with the future US President John F Kennedy’s sister Patricia. He then returned to England and married the woman who became Dr Welby’s mother.

The archbishop has been left wondering whether he might have a secret brother or sister.

Letters have also revealed that the 
bishop’s father introduced John F Kennedy to his first mistress, a 
21-year-old Swedish aristocrat, weeks before the future President’s 
marriage to Jacqueline Bouvier.

He also discovered that his enigmatic father’s surname was changed by deed poll from his birth name of Weiler.

The son of a German Jewish immigrant, his father had disguised his real name and his roots. The deception meant that, when Gavin Welby died in 1977, his unsuspecting son gave inaccurate details of the father’s name and birth on the death certificate.

The archbishop’s admission of sleeps in service came as he announced yesterday that he has appointed Rev Dr Jo Bailey Wells as his personal chaplain, becoming the first woman to take the post at Lambeth Palace.

During his address, the archbishop said there was a culture of fear in the Anglican Church, with journalists, scientists, politicians, bankers and even bishops being mistrusted.

Not his first admission: The Most Rev Justin Welby (pictured as he was received by the Queen earlier this week) once laughed through a passage from the Old Testament forbidding the eating of 'rock badgers'
