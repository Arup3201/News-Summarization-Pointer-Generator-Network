The Mars rover Curiosity has completed its first chemical test of soil from the red planet, and scientists say there are no surprises so far.

The spacecraft is on a mission to look for ingredients in Martian soil and rocks that could support life.

But in the first scoop of soil analyzed, there were no definitive signs of the chemical building blocks of life.

'We have no definitive detection of 
Martian organics at this point, but we will keep looking in the diverse 
environments of Gale Crater,' said SAM Principal Investigator Paul 
Mahaffy of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.

Instead, the six-wheel rover detected water and a mix of other chemicals.

The findings were reported at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco.

A comment by mission's chief scientist two weeks ago led to speculation 
that Curiosity had dug up carbon-based organics, considered an essential
 ingredient for life.

The Curiosity rover's instruments 
have found signs of organic compounds on Mars - but Nasa has refused to 
confirm they were not taken there by the rover.

'You have to be careful about what you say and how you say it,' said Nasa's John Grotzinger.

'The enthusiasm we had was just misunderstood,' he admitted.

'We're doing science at the speed of science in a world that goes at the speed of Instagrams.'

The finding comes as NASA's Mars 
Curiosity rover has used its full array of instruments to analyze 
Martian soil for the first time, and found a complex chemistry within 
the Martian soil.

Water
 and sulfur and chlorine-containing substances, among other ingredients,
 showed up in samples Curiosity's arm delivered to an analytical 
laboratory inside the rover.

The sample came from a drift of windblown dust and sand called 'Rocknest.'

The site lies in a relatively flat 
part of Gale Crater still miles away from the rover's main destination 
on the slope of a mountain called Mount Sharp.

The rover's laboratory includes the 
Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) suite and the Chemistry and Mineralogy 
(CheMin) instrument.Â 

SAM used three methods to analyze gases given off 
from the dusty sand when it was heated in a tiny oven.

One class of substances SAM checks for is organic compounds -- carbon-containing chemicals that can be ingredients for life.

SAM tentatively identified the oxygen
 and chlorine compound perchlorate, a reactive chemical previously found
 in arctic Martian soil by NASA's Phoenix Lander.

Reactions with other chemicals heated
 in SAM formed chlorinated methane compounds -- one-carbon organics that
 were detected by the instrument.

The chlorine is of Martian origin, but
 it is possible the carbon may be of Earth origin, carried by Curiosity 
and detected by SAM's high sensitivity design.

Curiosity's team selected Rocknest as the first scooping site because it has fine sand particles suited for scrubbing interior surfaces of the arm's sample-handling chambers.

Sand was vibrated inside the chambers to remove residue from Earth.

MAHLI close-up images of Rocknest show a dust-coated crust one or two sand grains thick, covering dark, finer sand.

'Active drifts on Mars look darker on the surface,' said MAHLI Principal Investigator Ken Edgett, of Malin Space Science Systems in San Diego.

'This is an older drift that has had time to be inactive, letting the crust form and dust accumulate on it.'

CheMin's examination of Rocknest samples found the composition is about half common volcanic minerals and half non-crystalline materials such as glass.

'We used almost every part of our science payload examining this drift,' said Curiosity Project Scientist John Grotzinger of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.

'The synergies of the instruments and richness of the data sets give us great promise for using them at the mission's main science destination on Mount Sharp.'
