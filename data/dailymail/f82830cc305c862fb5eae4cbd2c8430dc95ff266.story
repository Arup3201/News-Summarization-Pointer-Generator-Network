Charles and Lisa Black moved to Maine 
after careers as teachers in Kansas, pursuing an idyllic retirement that
 prosecutors say was destroyed by arguments over money and infidelity 
before both plummeted off a cliff.

That's the story presented by prosecutors Tuesday during opening arguments in the trial of Charles Black, 71, who appeared in Knox County Superior Court Tuesday.

District Attorney Geoffrey Rushlau argued Charles wanted his wife dead so he could inherit her father's millions.

Yahoo reports that the couple were fighting over spending and that Lisa Black had discovered her husband was in the midst of an online affair.

'What you’ll hear is evidence of two motives: one, money, and the second, another woman,' Rushlau told the court.

Prosecutors
 say 71-year-old Charles Black hit his wife on the head with a rock 
before pushing her off the 800-foot Maiden Cliff in April 2011 in in 
Camden Hills State Park.

'She’ll
 tell you that she was begging for her life, that she was speaking about
 her two daughters and begging that he not do this,' Rushlau said.

She survived by landing on a rock ledge just feet from the mountain top.

Lisa Black, 55, says she believed Charles was 
chasing her when he, too, tumbled down the mountain, according to a 
police report.

Law 
enforcement officials have said Lisa Black received a $4 million 
inheritance from her father, and she and Charles Black had a dispute 
over how he spent some of the money without her permission. Lisa has 
also accused Charles Black of having an online affair.

But Charles Black's attorney argues he had no reason to kill his wife, and that there is no physical evidence to back their story up.

'What you’ll have to conclude is that it just didn’t happen the way that Lisa Black said it did at all,' said attorney Walter McKee.

Charles
 Black now lives in Salt Lake City and faces numerous charges, including
 attempted murder, which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in 
prison.

The prosecution has also asked the court for permission to 
introduce evidence that he had earlier tried to poison Lisa Black.

McKee attempted to have the charges dismissed over 
the way prosecutors obtained hundreds of pages of Black's medical 
records.

He has said prosecutors used 'secret search warrants' to get 
Black's the records and should have subpoenaed them instead. McKee lost 
the bid for dismissal in April.

McKee
 said he expects the trial to take two weeks. He said the recent 
accusation of poisoning is 'bizarre' and the state can expect 'a 
vigorous challenge.'

Calls
 to Lisa Black and Charles Black were not returned. Police said the 
couple was hiking on Mount Megunticook when the fall occurred.

Lisa
 Black fell a short distance down the mountain, stood up and ran to seek
 help. Charles Black also fell down the mountain - a police report said 
Lisa believed he was chasing her - and both suffered serious injuries.

He
 told police he fainted, fell forward and hit the back of Lisa Black's 
head with his own head, but he had no memory of pushing her off the 
cliff. They divorced in 2013 after nine years of marriage.

The
 Blacks are former Johnson County, Kansas, teachers who had moved to 
Maine about a year earlier. Lisa Black had taught fourth grade while 
Charles Black was a social studies teacher.

A
 judge banned Charles Black from staying in Camden during the trial. 
Prosecutors have said Lisa Black is concerned about her safety if 
Charles is allowed in town.

In
 addition to attempted murder, Black is charged with two counts of 
elevated aggravated assault and three counts of aggravated assault.
