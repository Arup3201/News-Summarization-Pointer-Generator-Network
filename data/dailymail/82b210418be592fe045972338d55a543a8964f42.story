Bryan Oviedo admitted he left South Wales with mixed emotions after Everton were beaten 3-0 by Swansea in the Capital One cup on Tuesday.

The  Costa Rican defender hadn't played since breaking his leg January's FA Cup clash against Stevenage, but started for the Toffees at the Liberty Stadium.

And although he was relieved to be back playing, the left back was disappointed at the nature of Everton's 3-0 defeat.

Bryan Oviedo was delighted to be back after eight months out and salutes the Everton fans 

The Costa Rican was frustrated at his side's display in losing 3-0 to Swansea at the Liberty Stadium 

The defender hadn't played since breaking his leg when tackled by Stevenage's Simon Hislop in January

He said: 'Of course I feel very happy. I want to play. This was a nice opportunity but I don't agree with the result. Swansea played well and scored goals. Games like this happen sometimes.

'It was very emotional to be in the starting line-up again. I was very excited when I knew I would be.

'I had been waiting for eight months and tonight I had the chance. I tried to give everything but the result wasn't good enough. 

Given his lack of match fitness, it was unsurprising that Oviedo was substituted after 58 minutes 

The popular left back said he felt 'very emotional' to be back playing, and was extremely pleased to start

'Now we need to go home and look at what went wrong.'

Despite not playing for eight months, Everton fans have not stopped singing the 'Oviedo Baby' chant in honour of the popular defender, and the Toffees fans gave the returning Costa Rican a warm reception in South Wales on Tuesday.

Oviedo added: 'It was a nice moment. I am very happy. I want to say 'thank you' for that reaction.

'I have been out a long time and it is difficult but when I come and see the support it is amazing.

'All throughout my recovery Evertonians have given me their support. I want to thank them all for that.'
