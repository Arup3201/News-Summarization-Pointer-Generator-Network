Jack Colback has warned his Newcastle team-mates you don’t get any points for plucky performances in the Premier League.

The Magpies were beaten 2-0 by champions Manchester City on Sunday as five of Alan Pardew’s seven close-season signings made their debut.

Pardew praised his players afterwards and insisted he is optimistic for the season ahead. But for all of their spirit United still emerged empty handed and were the only top-flight team not to register a shot on target.

Up your game: Jack Colback has warned his team-mates that they need to up their game

Debutant: The midfielder made his first appearance for Newcasle following his switch from Sunderland

Colback – who joined on a free transfer from Sunderland this summer – was encouraged by the display, but has also reminded his new comrades that unlucky losers are still losers.

‘You get nothing for a pat on the back in this league,’ he said.

‘There is no point upping our game against the better teams and then not performing against the so-called lesser sides, otherwise we will lose games.

‘We need to make sure we are winning games. But if we apply ourselves like we did (on Sunday), I’m sure we can get some good results. We’ve got to do that every week, regardless of who we play.’

Battle: Colback worked hard and did well in the middle of the park but Man City had too much class in the end

Quality: David Silva broke the deadlock for his side in the first half

Conclusive: Before Sergio Aguero confirmed the result for City with a fine effort late on

Colback, 24, was Newcastle’s best player as he made his first appearance for his hometown club.

And he added: ‘It was a controversial move (from Sunderland), but I just want to come here, get my head down and play my football and do well for the team.

‘(My debut) feels bittersweet really. It was a great occasion for me personally to play (at St James’). The atmosphere was brilliant. But we came away without any points so it’s disappointing.’
