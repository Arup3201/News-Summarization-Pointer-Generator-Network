Fresh light has been shone on the mystery of Sandy Island after an Australian librarian found the landmass that wasn't on a 1908 map.

The mysterious island sparked worldwide interest last month when a team of researchers who went on a hunt for it discovered nothing but waves when they arrived.

A range of maps and charts, including Google Earth and others both historical and modern, showed in the Coral Sea between Australia and New Caledonia.

Earliest mention? Sandy Island is shown in this 1908 admiralty chart in Auckland Museum's collection as a substantially sized island in the middle of the Coral Sea to the east of the Chesterfields

However, its existence would have been a geological oddity since it apparently sat in a region of deep waters.

In an effort to track down its earliest appearance on a map librarian Shaun Higgins scoured Auckland Museum's large collection of maps and charts of the Pacific, the museum's blog reported.

After searching through maps dating as far back as the 1700s, Mr Higgins finally tracked down Sandy Island's earliest appearance in the collection to a 1908 admiralty chart.

Grey Meylan, a writer in the museum's exhibitions team, said the chart indicates that the island was discovered by a ship called the Velocity in 1876.

But, he adds, there is a generic note attached to the map which warns: 'Caution is necessary while navigating among the low lying islands of the Pacific Ocean.

'The general details have been collated from the voyages of various navigators extending over a long series of years. The relative position of many dangers may therefore not be exactly given.'

Mr Higgins told the Sydney Morning Herald: 'It has the same shape as [on] Google Earth, but it's dotted. It could have been dotted because it was an unidentified hazard.'

A reader the Auckland Museum's blog posted a comment on their story saying the Velocity was a 140 ton whaling ship captained by a J.W. Robinson.

The post, which cited an article in the Hobart Mercury from April 1877, went on: 'Captain Robinson reported that he left the river [Hobart] on the 15th April 1876 and proceeded to Cato’s Bank where whales were seen once during a gale of wind.

'Shortly after this the vessel sprang a leak, which kept on increasing and a course was shaped for the Chesterfield group, where an anchorage being obtained the leak was partially stopped.

'While there an anchor and chain were lost in a heavy gale, and the brig then went to Solomon Islands anchoring in Mackira Bay, San Christoval [San Cristobal].'

The commenter added: 'This gives the Velocity in the area of ‘Sandy Island’ in 1876.'

A reference to the island is also found in the 1879 edition of the Australia directory produced by the admiralty hydrographic department, the Herald reported.

'In 1876, the master of the whaler Velocity reported that while cruising on the eastern side of the Chesterfield and Bampton reefs, he observed heavy breakers in lat 19' 50' S long, 158' 50' E,' it said.

'The master of Velocity also reported a line of sandy islets as extending about North and South along the meridian of 159' 57 E, between lat 19'7 S and 19'20 S.'

Look for yourself: This map embedded from Google maps shows the location of the phantom island

Interest was sparked in Sandy Island after a group of researchers from the University of Sydney went on a voyage in search of it and found it did not exist.

As well as appearing on Google Maps, the Times Atlas of the World appeared to identify the phantom landmass as Sable Island, and it was also shown weather maps used by the Southern Surveyor, the maritime research vessel which the team travelled on.

Mission: Dr Maria Seton, of the University of Sydney, who was part of the team who went in search of Sandy Island last month

But when the ship, which was tasked with identifying fragments of the Australian continental crust submerged in the Coral Sea, steamed to where it was supposed to be there was nothing there.

The island had supposedly sat in an area of very deep sea, making its existence something of a geological oddity that researchers wanted to investigate.

'We wanted to check it out because the navigation charts on board the ship showed a water depth of 1,400 metres (4,620 feet) in that area - very deep,' said Dr Maria Seton, of the University of Sydney, after the 25-day voyage.

'It's on Google Earth and other maps so we went to check and there was no island. We're really puzzled. It's quite bizarre.'

The latest development in the Sandy Island mystery seems to put paid to the theory, previously reported by MailOnline, that the landmass appeared as the result of an error in digitising satellite maps.

However, it does not answer the question of why it wasn't removed from maps after amateur radio enthusiasts discovered it wasn't actually there in 2000.

Indeed, Tim Totten, one ham radio enthusiast, told MailOnline that he had heard of a number of rumours of so-called 'Sandy Islands' that turned out to be phantoms.

He was part of an expedition disproving the existence of another such land mass with the same name near the Solomon Islands, he said.

The Coral Sea's Sandy Island now appears to have been removed from Google Maps, however it still appears on the service's Satellite View and on Google Earth.
