Three men from the south of England have been arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences linked to Syria.

Two men from Slough, Berkshire, and one man from Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, were arrested by the South East Counter Terrorism Unit (SECTU).

The 27-year-old from Stoke Poges and the 26-year-old from Slough were arrested on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts under Section 5 of the Terrorism Act.

The second 26-year-old man was arrested at an address in Slough yesterday on suspicion of financing terrorist acts under under Section 17 of the Terrorism Act.

All three have been bailed until dates in August.

Chief inspector Gavin Wong, of Thames 
Valley Police, said: 'These arrests demonstrate that positive action is 
being taken to safeguard members of the community from the dangers of 
travelling to Syria.

'The police will continue to work with our partners and community in the interests of public safety and I would ask that we all continue to discourage anyone from attempting to travel to Syria or other areas of conflict.

'While the motive may be honourable, the reality is that these areas are hugely dangerous, and it can be an opportunity to radicalise vulnerable people.'
