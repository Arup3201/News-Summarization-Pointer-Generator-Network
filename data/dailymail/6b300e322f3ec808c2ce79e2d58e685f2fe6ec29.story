An MP charged with assault over a Commons bar brawl faced fresh calls to quit yesterday after he was accused of having an affair with a schoolgirl.

Senior Labour officials said Eric Joyce, 51, should stand down following claims of a two-year relationship with teenager Meg Lauder, which is said to have started when she was only 17.

The politician denies having an inappropriate relationship with Miss Lauder, now 19, and said he had not seen her since she worked for him during his 2010 general election campaign.

Former Army major Joyce, who is separated from his wife Rosemary, was suspended by the Labour party last week after being charged with common assault.

He was arrested after allegedly head-butting Conservative MP Stuart Andrew, 40, in an alcohol-fuelled confrontation in the Strangers’ Bar in the House of Commons.

Miss Lauder worked in the Falkirk MP’s 
office before the May 2010 election, and appeared beside Joyce in a 
photograph on a campaign leaflet.

The political activist and blogger has shut down several of her accounts on social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook, and has made no public comment.

A source told the Daily Record newspaper that the 5ft 2in teenager was ‘absolutely in rapture’ with Joyce, who has young twin daughters.

‘He bragged about his Westminster contacts, made a big show of the fact he was an MP to her,’ they added. ‘He made a huge impression on her from the start and continued to do so.’

The relationship is said to have lasted two years.

Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont said: ‘If these reports are true, this is a man who has abused his position of power and authority. I’m disgusted, regardless of any other issues. I think this makes Eric Joyce unfit to stand for the Labour Party.’

A neighbour of the Lauder family said: ‘Meg is a very nice girl. I have no words for what Eric Joyce did; what he has done is despicable.’

If he resigns, Joyce would trigger a by-election in his constituency. Labour currently holds a narrow majority in Falkirk over the Scottish National Party. Joyce, who also faced calls to stand down over the assault allegations, emphatically denied having an affair with Miss Lauder and claimed he had not seen her since the general election.

‘The story is not true and I will be taking legal advice,’ he said.

Asked if the pair had a sexual relationship, he replied: ‘No.’

Friends of Miss Lauder said she frequently discussed her relationship with Joyce, and claimed she was now involved with a man in his late forties.

Claire Templeton, who worked with the student for a year at clothing shop Matalan, said: ‘She was very open about her relationship with him.’

Another former colleague, Robyn Inch, 
added: ‘She didn’t hold back on what she told us. We always thought she 
was just joking and would laugh with her about it, so didn’t think 
anything of it.

But she used to go on about him [Joyce] and how nice he 
was. She would say how he was really good-looking and they got on with 
each other really well.’

Miss Lauder, now at Glasgow University, was described as a student in 
Joyce’s 2010 election leaflet but did not leave school until later that 
year.

The MP sent her a Twitter message in August, asking what grades she had achieved in her exams.

In Joyce’s pamphlet, she was quoted as saying: ‘I’m pleased Eric takes 
the environment seriously and is deeply committed to making the UK a 
leading digital economy.

He already has a strong record on these issues 
in Parliament and I’ll be pressing him to continue ... I trust Eric and 
Labour to help us along the way.’

Joyce separated from his second wife, the headmistress of Tonbridge Grammar School in Kent, in 2008.

He is due to appear before West London Magistrates Court on March 7, charged with three counts of common assault.
