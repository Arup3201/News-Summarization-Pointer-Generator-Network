Two doctors locked their nanny in her room, told her she would never be allowed to go home and said they would ‘sell’ her because she was costing too much money, a court heard.

Drs Safaa Hassan Ismail, 45, and Hussien El-Maghraby, 47, are accused of trafficking, false imprisonment and holding Egyptian Asmaa Hemdan in servitude, Southwark Crown Court heard today.

The couple arranged travel documents through a relative bringing the 27-year-old to their home in Muswell Hill in May 2011 with the intention of exploiting her, it is claimed.

The alleged victim was told she would be working as a nanny for the couple’s young son, and occasionally looking after their niece, who also lived with the couple, being paid £200 a month to work six days a week.

But when she arrived her passport was taken from her and she was forced to work long hours doing other chores including cleaning the house.

The court heard how the woman was locked in the house when the couple went out, kept under ‘constant watch’ and only allowed out of the house when accompanying Dr Ismail.

After becoming ‘very depressed’ she asked to go back to Egypt, but was locked in her room without food and water and told she couldn’t come out until ‘she learnt some manners’, the court heard.

Following a discussion with Dr Ismail after the incident, she was told she would ‘never be allowed to leave’.

The court heard the woman overheard a conversation between the couple in which she claims they said she would be sold as she was costing to much.

The family were preparing to move from London to Rugby for Dr Maghraby’s job.

After four months of her alleged ordeal she took a rare opportunity to flee, the court heard.

She was found sobbing at a bus stop by a stranger and later reported her ordeal to the police.

Opening the case, prosecutor Timothy Forster said today: 'Asmaa Hemdan was told that she would be working as a nanny for the couple's young son for these two defendants Dr Safaa Ismail and Dr Hussien El-Maghraby, both of whom are medical doctors.

'She said she was physically abused, 
pushed and shoved by Dr Ismail. There are photos that you will see that 
show bruising on the alleged victim. Even though she is a very religious
woman she was prevented from going to the Mosque'

'Asmaa Hemdan comes from Eygpt and is from a very poor background. She had previously worked as a cleaner for Dr Ismail’s sister. This is the connection to the two defendants.

'This case is essentially about expectations.'

He said she expected to be paid a fixed sum of £200 to be a nanny and would be treated as a member of the family.

He said: 'She thought she would be given the opportunity to improve herself by taking an educational course and by meeting people.

'She had been interviewed in Egypt by Dr Ismail’s sister in law and this is when she says she was told what her duties would be.

'But when she arrived with the family the reality of her life was decidedly different from what she had been lead to expect.'

Mr Forster said the victim's passport was taken away from her and never returned and she was forced to work long hours.

He said: 'Indeed, she was a nanny, she was a cleaner, on top of that she was expected to look after Dr Ismail’s every need, and kept under watch by Dr Ismail constantly.

'She was told she would be paid £200 a month into a bank account and indeed an account was opened for her when she first arrived. Four hundred pounds was paid into the bank account in the four month period she was living with the family.

'But she was never given access to this money. She never had a bank card. If she wanted to get money she would have to go with Dr Ismail.'

He said she was not allowed to leave the house on her own and when Ismail left the house should be locked inside.

He said: 'She said she was physically abused, pushed and shoved by Dr Ismail. There are photos that you will see that show bruising on the alleged victim. Even though she is a very religious woman she was prevented from going to the Mosque.

'The hard work and long hours she was forced to do resulted in back pain but when she asked to go the doctor she was not allowed to go.'

Mr Forster said Ms Hemdan asked to go home to Egypt after she became depressed with the work, but Ismail became angry following the request and locked her in her room.

Mr Forster said: 'She was not given any water or food and told she couldn’t come out until she had apologised to the family and learned some manners.'

Mr Forster went on to say: 'She recalls overhearing a conversation between Dr Ismail and Dr Maghraby, in which Dr Maghraby is said to have complained that the victim was costing the family too much money. To which she says she heard Dr Ismail say "don’t worry when we move house we can sell her".

'If you believe this account this is a clear indication of how the pair viewed the victim.'

Ms Hemdan accepted the job in the UK hoping to be able to provide for her brothers and sisters in Cairo, the court heard.

The alleged victim, who is giving evidence from behind a screen, said she had been promised a regular wage and support for her struggling family. 'My siblings were the main reason for me to accept to travel to England’, she told the court.

‘They had no income, and I had high hopes that I could work and help them financially.’

Ms Hemdan said her previous employer, Ismail’s sister Hanaa, had promised her a better life in the UK.

‘Dr Hanaa told me that while I was away, if I took the job they would take care of my brothers and sisters’, she said.

‘We didn’t have enough money to pay the rent, or for food, and she reassured me they would be taken care of while I was away.’

She added: ‘Dr Hanaa told me that any time I wanted to come back home, they would bring me.’

The alleged victim said her previous employer treated her well, but she was told to expect even better conditions in the UK with Ismail and El Maghraby. ‘Dr Hanaa used to mention she had a sister who lived in London, who had a son’, she said.

‘She used to tell me she liked my work, I was honest and straight forward, and she would recommend me to work for her sister.’

Ms Hemdan was taken to the British embassy to get a visa, and signed papers for a new passport before leaving Cairo.

Speaking through an interpreter, she said she did not understand the paperwork, which was in English, but signed it because she trusted her employer at the time.

She was handed her passport on the plane to the UK, the court heard, but it was taken from her as soon as she got through customs.

‘There was a page in Arabic which said that every person was responsible for their passport’, she said.

‘When I found out it was my responsibility to hold on to that document, I would have preferred to hold on to it. But when I crossed passport control, she took it from me.’

Ms Hemdan said she never saw the passport again.

Her evidence continues. The trail is expected to last eight days.

Both defendants deny the charges. The case continues.
