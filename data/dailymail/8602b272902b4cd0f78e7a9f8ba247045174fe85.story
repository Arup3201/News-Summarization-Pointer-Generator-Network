A three-year-old has died after being found unresponsive and ‘covered head to toe in bruises’ at her mother’s house.

Carmen Ellis, described as her grandmother as full of love, was on a ventilator at a hospital in Indianapolis, but died late last night. 

Twenty-year-old Jose Cruz, the boyfriend of Carmen’s mother, has been arrested in the girl’s death, and is facing preliminary charges of attempted murder.

Police received a call on Tuesday to go to Long Wharf Drive in Warren Woods, Indiana, about 13 miles outside Indianapolis. 

According to WISH-TV, that’s when police discovered little Carmen in a bedroom with her mother, limp and allegedly covered head-to-toe in bruises.

The girl was rushed to the hospital and put on life support.

She was kept alive until Wednesday so her organs could be donated, Indystar.com reported.

Officers found Cruz in the house wearing a sopping wet T-shirt and looking crazed.

This isn’t Cruz’s first brush-in with authorities. In July, a concerned neighbour called the police last month, reporting possible bite marks on the girl’s face.

However, the case was handed over to Child Services.

Carmen’s grandmother, Tina Ellis, told WISH-TV: ‘Carmen is a beautiful three year old girl. She is smart, very smart.’

Authorities said Carmen’s mother is currently not facing charges, but could, based on what officers find in their on-going investigation.

Cruz’s charge will likely be upgraded to murder.
