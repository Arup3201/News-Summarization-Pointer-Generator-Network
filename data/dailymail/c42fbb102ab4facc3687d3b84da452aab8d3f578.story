This cheeky chimp is not going to let the cold get in the way of his fun in the snow, strapping on a snow suit before he heads out to play.

The adorable little chap seems delighted to be out and about despite the freezing conditions, as he bounds around, delightedly throwing himself into the snow drifts.

The pint sized primate - nicknamed Vanya - excitedly launches forward and ploughs head first into piles of snow before he sits back to contemplate his next move.

The owner of the monkey, believed to be from Russia, tenderly wipes the snow from his face as they film him trying to catch falling snowflakes in his mouth.

It is thought the monkey is a Japanese macaque, which are well suited to the cold, as the thickness of their coats increases as temperatures decrease.

But the sight of monkeys in clothes is not a hit with everyone.

Animal right campaigner group Peta said keeping a monkey as a pet was like 'like lighting a fuse and pretending that it won't go off.'

A spokesman added: 'You'd think after a Connecticut woman made international news when her face was ripped off by her friend's "pet" chimpanzee that people would wake up to the fact that wild animals have no place in people's homes.

'In addition to being a danger to people, captive wild animals are denied everything that is natural and important to them – companionship for one, not to mention the opportunity to run, climb, hunt and establish their territory.'

A woman from Toronto 
recently came under fire from campaigners when her pet macaque escaped 
and was found wandering an Ikea car park, dressed in a sheepskin coat 
and a nappy.

Yasmin Nakhuda said the Japanese macaque, named Darwin, was near her at all times, including while she slept and showered.

Ms Nahkuda, who calls the creature her baby, launched a campaign to get the monkey back after he was  taken from her by animal control officials and moved to a sanctuary in Sunderland, Ontario, where he now lives.

It comes as Iran announced plans to send a monkey into space after sparking massive security fears by launching a missile to carry a second satellite into orbit.

The country's top space official Hamid Fazeli announced the disturbing plans at the launch of the Rassad-1 satellite to produce detailed maps of the earth.
