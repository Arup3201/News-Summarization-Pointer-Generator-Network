Bubba Watson was left 'pie-faced' when television host Jimmy Fallon asked the golfer, who is currently number three in the world, to play a spot of Pie Golf on the Tonight Show.

Watson was invited by Fallon to play the entertaining game during the American chat show, which was watched by millions of viewers on Monday night.

Both players wore goggles for the game, which involves hitting specially designed golf balls at a Velcro wall, with those that fail receiving a cream pie to the face.

Watson donned his famous Masters green jacket on the show, but was quick to remove it as he prepared to do battle with the chat show host.

Watson's decision to remove the jacket proved a shrewd move as the Florida-born golfer took a cream pie to the face before going on to win the duo's head-to-head.

Fallon, complete with pie crumbs on his face, later interviewed Watson, he said: 'You're fantastic, obviously. Are you excited about Augusta coming up?'

'Yes,' Bubba replied. 'It's the best tournament of all year, and the courses are in perfect shape.'
