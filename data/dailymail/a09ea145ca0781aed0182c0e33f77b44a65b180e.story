An American football star has sensationally claimed he was assaulted by his estranged wife in front of his sons - after posting a Twitter picture of himself filling out a police report.

NFL Hall of Famer Deion Sanders has revealed plans to press charges against his estranged wife Pilar Sanders after alleging that she attacked him in his Dallas home on Monday night.

The 44-year-old, who enjoyed a successful career in both baseball and American football, said his estranged wife and another person entered his home and began 'kicking, biting, and scratching' in front of his two children.

Pilar Sanders has since been arrested on domestic violence-related charges, but not before former Dallas Cowboys cornerback Sanders posted several tweets detailing the alleged attack.

Sanders posted to his 387,000 Twitter followers: 'Pray for me and my kids now! They just witnessed their mother and a friend jump me in my room. She's going to jail n I'm pressing charges!'

He then added in a post which has since been removed: 'I'm sad my boys witnessed this mess but I warned the police department here that she was gone try n harm me and my boys. This is on my mama!'

The former NFL star also posted a photo, which has since been taken down, of him and his two sons, aged 10 and 12, sitting at home filling out what appears to be police paperwork.

Alongside the image, he had posted the caption: 'filling out police reports now! Thank God for this platform to issue the Truth.'

Happier times: The couple, who met in 1999 after Sanders split from his first wife, have three children together but started divorce proceedings in December

According to TMZ.com, a police car and fire truck were seen outside Sanders' house in suburban Dallas on Monday night.

Sanders filed for divorce from Pilar, his second wife, in December.

The couple have endured an extremely rocky break-up, and despite starring in their own reality show, 'Deion and Pilar Prime Time Love', have had a very bitter and public divorce.

They had met in 1999 and have three children together, as well as the two children Deion had from his first marriage.

In February, Pilar filed a suit against Deion after claiming his aunt attacked her in her 10-bedroom home in Prosper, Texas, while Deion watched.

Neither the NFL Network, who Sanders works for as an analyst, or the star's business manager would comment on the allegations.
