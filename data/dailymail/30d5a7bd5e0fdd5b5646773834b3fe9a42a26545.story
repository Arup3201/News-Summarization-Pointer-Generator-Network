Joshua Holley was paddling off of Oahu’s North Shore on Tuesday when he was attacked by what he thought was a ten-foot tiger shark.

The 28-year-old surfer said he felt something brush against him, and then latch onto his foot.

Rather than panic, Mr Holley’s instinct kicked in, and he punched the shark squarely in the nose, yelling at it: ‘I’m not gonna die today.’

Though he required 42 stitches and will need surgery to repair two torn tendons, Mr Holley says he harbours no ill will toward the shark that attacked him.

‘I’m not really angry at the shark,’ he told ABC News. ‘He was just doing what he does, I’ll definitely be back.’

Honolulu lifeguard operations chief Jim Howe said the shark came up to Mr Holley and bit him repeatedly, according to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.

'It came up and got him and let him go, then came up and got him a second time,' Mr Howe said. 'He fought it off with his board and got a good look at it.'

Mr Holley described the attack to kitv.com, calling it ‘pretty frightening.’

He said: ‘I felt an unreal push on the left side of my body. There was a popping sensation on my foot. I look down to the left and I see this huge dorsal fin.’

Mr Holley's father Harold Holley said his son punched the shark twice and made his way back to the shore with the help of two fellow beachgoers.

Once on shore, his badly bitten foot was bandaged up.

Harold Holley told Hawaii News Now that he was stunned when he heard his son had been attacked. ‘We talk about this so many times ‘cause we’re always in the water, but you never think it’s going to happen to you,’ he said.

Mr Holley was treated on the beach before being taken to Wahiawa General Hospital.

Ocean safety officials are warning people to stay out of the water in the area where the attack happened.

Warning signs have been posted at several North Shore beaches.
