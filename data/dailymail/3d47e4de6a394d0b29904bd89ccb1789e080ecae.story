World War II photographs showing the liberation of the first Nazi concentration camp discovered by U.S. forces have now inspired the grandson of the soldier who took them to make a documentary about the holocaust.

The moving set of 16 photographs shows survivors of the Ohrdruf concentration camp. Many are on the brink of starvation, others are being treated by U.S army doctors.

The photographer Ron Johnson, then a lieutenant and army medic, had mentioned then to his grandson Matthew Nash only once before he died in 1991.

The summer he was 12, Nash asked about
 his grandfather's World War II service as the two were stacking wood in
 his grandparents' barn in East Dorset, Vt.

'As
 I recall he got really quiet,' said Nash, now a 37-year-old photography
 professor at Lesley University. 'I think he just said, `Yeah, we saw 
some really terrible things. When you get a little older, I'll show you 
some pictures and you'll understand.'

But
 Donald Grant Johnson, a former Army lieutenant, died without 
sharing the photos with his grandson. Family members only spoke of the 
pictures in whispers.

Now some 68 years after they were taken, they are the subject of a new documentary that Nash spent three years making.

Kept hidden from Nash and 
others in the family, the photos were not something Nash's grandfather 
seemed to want to talk about with relatives. But they were something he 
could never forget.

Nash's film - '16 Photographs at Ohrdruf' - tells of the first concentration camp that U.S. soldiers liberated in 1945.

The
 72-minute film will have its first public screening Thursday evening at
 Lesley University in Cambridge, Mass., and also will be shown as part 
of the Boston International Film Festival on April 16 and the G.I. Film 
Festival in Washington in May.

When
 Nash's grandmother threatened to destroy them when the subject came up 
at Thanksgiving dinner in 1995, Nash and his sister felt compelled to 
secretly sift through their late grandfather's belongings the following 
Christmas.

That's when they found an envelope 
marked 'Holocaust' tucked away in a wooden trunk. Inside were a few 
letters and a series of snapshots of a war horror the 23-year-old 
Johnson encountered as a soldier in April 1945.

Johnson
 took most of the photos at Ohrdruf in Germany. Nash believes his 
grandfather may have treated survivors of the camp, which the Germans 
had formed as a sub-camp of Buchenwald.

On
 a personalized sheet of notepaper with 'Don Johnson' printed at the 
top, the 65th Infantry Division Army veteran cataloged the photo 
collection as best he could.

'Lime Pit - effort to destroy bodies,'
 reads one handwritten caption. 'Griddle used in (vain) attempt to 
incinerate bodies - note skull bottom center,' reads another. 'Small 
stack of bodies,' says yet another.

Soldiers
 are on the outskirts of some of Johnson's shots, standing together to 
view piles of emaciated and burned corpses. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower 
wanted many witnesses to the Nazi atrocity so that reports of it 
couldn't be dismissed as propaganda.

'He
 had as many units as possible come and see the camp,' said Geoffrey 
Megargee, a scholar from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum who appears 
in Nash's film.

Johnson likely came to Ohrdruf within a
 few days of its liberation. He later returned home to become a banker, 
National Guard soldier, and a volunteer emergency-medical technician.

Some of Johnson's photos show survivors, including what he described as a survivor being treated by two camp doctors.

The
 skeletal-looking man is lying on a cot, with what appears to be an open
 wound on his hip, as the men stand beside him. In another, a 
bare-chested boy of about 14 looks toward the camera, with what appears 
to be prisoner barracks in the background.

Nash
 found 19 photos in all and used 16 in his film. His research showed his
 grandfather may have shot a few of the photos at Mauthausen 
concentration camp in Austria.

The
 professor also discovered from letters his grandfather packed away with
 the pictures that he had wanted his photographs to become part of the 
U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. He said in one letter that he had 
visited more than one concentration camp, but Ohrdruf was engraved in 
his memory.

'I keep the pictures close at hand and have made a point of looking at them frequently,' Johnson wrote. 'And, during my years of National Guard service, I made a point of showing them to the personnel, hoping we could prevent any such disasters from happening again.'

Johnson died two years before the 
museum opened, and before he sent the pictures. Nash has since given the
 photos to the museum for its archives, and said he's proud to have done
 that for his grandfather.

Nash made the documentary with about $5,000 and the help of friends in the film business.

Among
 film interviewees, Nash talked to veterans who served in the same 
infantry division as his grandfather, including Boston resident Edwin 
'Bud' Waite. The 87-year-old was an infantry soldier who wasn't part of 
liberating concentration camps, but visited Dachau later. He said he 
sees value in Nash's film effort.

'I
 think it's very important because the younger people nowadays, they 
don't really understand concentration camps back in World War II,' Waite
 said.

Ohrdruf concentration camp was part of the Buchenwald network of camps. In this file picture taken on April 16, 1945 inmates of the German KZ Buchenwald camp near Weimar are seen inside their barracks, a few days after liberation

Megargee, who will give a lecture before Thursday's screening, said Nash's film opens up a personal window into what the Allies were fighting against in World War II.

'When you can personalize the history, especially for younger kids, it helps to get them interested. It's one thing to talk about tens of thousands of camps. It's another thing to bring it down to the level of one American soldier,' he said.
