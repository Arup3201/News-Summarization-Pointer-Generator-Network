With a toothbrush moustache and jet black hair brushed over to one side, one Kosovan man believes he is the reincarnation of Adolf Hitler and travels everywhere with a copy of Mein Kampf.

Emin Djinovci from Mitrovica earns a living as a Hitler look-a-like and even charges tourists £60 for taking a photograph with him.

The 49-year-old has five daughters who he collectively calls 'Hitler's children' and is proud of his likeness to the Nazi leader because he fought against the Serbs – his enemies.

'I am proud of my likeness to the Fuhrer because, like him, I fought against the Serbs - my enemies,' he told InSerbia News.

'It is easy. I find myself in Hitler's character because he fought against my enemy. Enemy of my enemy is my friend. Yes, Serbs are my enemies.' 

Mr Djinovci moved to Kosovo in 1998 from Germany to fight of Kosovo Albanians for secession from Serbia.

He carries around copies of Hitler's hate-filled autobiography Mein Kampf - My Struggle – wherever he goes and bills himself as 'Kosovo reincarnation of Adolf Hitler.

Kosovan media reported that local business leaders have no problem with his strange way of earning a living because they believe he 'shows great enterprise.'

But if he tried posing as the Fuhrer in Germany, he would be arrested immediately because any gestures of the old Nazi regime, or the displaying of any of its symbols, is a serious crime.

In April 1941 Hitler gave the order for German forces - backed by Italian, Romanian, Hungarian and Bulgarian Axis allies - to invade Yugoslavia and Greece. 

The Serbs and the Croats made up the majority of the population of Yugoslavia at the time. 

There was a widespread persecution of Serbs during World War Two, referred to as the Serbian Genocide.

This included extermination, expulsions and forced religious conversions of large numbers of ethnic Serbs by the Ustaše regime and Axis occupying forces.
