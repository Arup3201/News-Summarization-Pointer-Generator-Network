A mother who tied up and caned the man who allegedly raped her young daughter is now likely to be charged for taking the law into her own hands.

A video showing the mother thrashing the 28-year-old man in a village in north east Malaysia has been taken off the web - but not before thousands saw her meting out her own form of punishment.

The man, who was caned across his bare buttocks by a tree branch, was so badly hurt that he had to receive hospital treatment.

A Malaysian mother took the law into her won hands when she tied up and caned a man who allegedly raped her daughter

The man was caned across his bare buttocks by a tree branch and needed hospital treatment for his injuries

If the 28-year-old man is convicted of raping a 13-year-old girl, he will likely to be caned

Ironically, if he is convicted of raping the 13-year-old girl he is likely to be caned all over again by the authorities as well as receiving a lengthy prison sentence.

Assistant police commissioner Lai Yong Heng said officers had viewed the video and were now trying to identify the mother and a group of people alleged to have helped her tie the man, pull down his pants and thrash his bare buttocks.

'He received injuries to his body and head and had to go to hospital, while a second man linked to the rape was assaulted by a group of people,' commissioner Lai told Malaysia's The Star newspaper.

Now those involved in handing out the punishment to the alleged rapists are also expected to be charged.

'People should not take the law Into their own hands, even if they believe they have a right to do so,' said Mr Lai.

Police want the woman and others seen in the footage to surrender themselves before they are arrested

'We hope that the woman and the others seen in the video will surrender themselves before they are arrested.'

The Star said the teenager had been raped several times by the two suspects in a house in the village of Tawang.

As the police search for the cane-wielding mother, people have taken to social media to defend her actions.

Stephen Riches wrote: 'I would also whip the living day lights out of any man that abused my child.'

Sithashini Balakrishnan defended the mother, writing:'All she was doing was making an example of the monster for all the other monsters out there.

'The other monsters will think twice before they do it again.'

Support: Since the video appeared online, there has been a wave of support from the community backing the woman's actions

Investigating: Police have confirmed they have seen the video and are trying to establish the identity of the mother
