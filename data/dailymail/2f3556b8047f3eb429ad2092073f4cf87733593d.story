A look at the Barclays Premier League table does not make happy reading initially for those championing British managers.

The bottom six teams are managed by Brits although, apart from Aston Villa, you’d expect them to be there. But look to Wales and you’ll find plenty of room for optimism. Garry Monk takes his Swansea side to Manchester City fifth in the table and just three points behind the champions. He is doing a very good job.

Swansea have beaten Manchester United and Arsenal this season and both times Monk has tactically outdone his opposite number. That is impressive when you consider that Louis van Gaal and Arsene Wenger are two of Europe’s most decorated managers. He obviously has a good footballing brain.

One of the most impressive things about Monk is transfer dealings. He realised that the atmosphere at the club wasn’t as it should be when he took over from Michael Laudrup and had no hesitation in moving players on to get rid of cliques: out went Chico, Michu, Pablo Hernandez and Alejandro Pozuelo.

Monk had been a player in that dressing room so he knew who he needed to keep and get rid of to restore harmony. Intelligent players know that. He also knew what a good signing and influence Gylfi Sigurdsson would be from his earlier spell at the club and made sure he brought him back.

A manager from outside the club might not have thought of him but Sigurdsson has been superb. He is one of the most underrated players in the Premier League, Tottenham were wrong to let him go and not many in the league could hit a free kick with the accuracy he did against Arsenal.

Swansea got off to the best possible start by beating Manchester United on the opening day

Monk has assembled a squad of match-winners: Batetimbi Gomis, Jefferson Montero and Modou Barrow are foreign signings who must have been expertly scouted and who look incredibly promising. It meant that even without three key men — Nathan Dyer, Wayne Routledge and Jonjo Shelvey — they could still beat Arsenal.

To spot Montero among the stars at the World Cup was particularly impressive. He obviously sees something good in England Under 21 captain Tom Carroll too. The 22-year-old is on loan from Spurs and there aren’t many midfielders of that age playing such a key role in our top flight.

They will all need to be on fire  as Swansea have never scored at the Etihad and haven’t won away at Manchester City since 1951.

Behind all that exciting attack is Ashley Williams, the central defender who continues to improve. Can you think of any centre halves who are performing better than him for club and country at the moment? I can’t. 

Things could easily have been different, of course. Before the Arsenal game, Swansea had won just one league game in seven, were four points off the relegation zone and Monk made some pretty aggressive comments about Stoke’s Victor Moses diving, calling him a cheat.

He has a rougher edge than those who have gone before him at the Liberty Stadium and he might have to choose his words more carefully in future. But he has regained his composure now and his performance should inspire British coaches that they might get their big break and encourage chairmen to give them a chance.

It is good for a player to be fast-tracked — Steve Gibson did so with Gareth Southgate at Middlesbrough.

It was another good call from chairman Huw Jenkins who has now appointed Roberto Martinez, Paulo Sousa (now boss in the Champions League with Basle), Brendan Rodgers and Michael Laudrup. He deserves huge credit. They all play attractive, passing football too.

If they can scrape a result on Saturday, with their next two games at home to Crystal Palace and QPR, maybe it’s time to start dreaming.
