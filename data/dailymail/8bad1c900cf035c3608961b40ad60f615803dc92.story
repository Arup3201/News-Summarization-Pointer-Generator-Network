A cat-loving couple from Australia are just days away from opening the country's first ever cafe where consumers can dine-in with fury felines.

Anita and Myles Loughran have been given the final approval to open their Melbourne coffee house, aptly titled Cat Cafe, which will effectively combine people's affection for cats with a love of good coffee.

The complex will include a purpose built area upstairs, above the cafe itself, which will permanently house 11 friendly-natured and well nurtured animals hand-picked from the owners themselves. The upstairs interior, where cafe-goers will be able to interact with animals, has been built to cat-friendly specifications and includes five rooms housing giant cat-climbing frames and carpeted shelves mounted to walls.

The Cat cafe will open on July 30 complete with a cafe on one level and a fully interactive upstairs area where cats and cafe-goers can play

Patrons can watch and interact with 11 cats, hand-picked by the owners from Victorian rescue shelters

Visitors who want to interact with cats can pay $5 for half hour and $10 for an hour

Humans will be able to spend time with animals in four of the five rooms, with one reserved as a cat-only area. Visitors who want to interact with cats can pay $10 for the first hour and then $5 for every half an hour.

There are rules around interacting, such as not feeding them or waking them if they're asleep, but there's no limit to the amount of time someone can spend with them.

Mrs Loughran said while there had been a lot of 'back and forth' in getting the project up and running, she was always confident the 'Tokyo-inspired' business would get off the ground.

She said the idea came to her and husband Myles after visiting a Japanese cafe similar to the one they are proposing.Â  After returning to Australia and becoming dissatisfied with their jobs, they decided to see if starting their own cat cafe was feasible.

Mrs Loughran said she found a gap in the market, but was faced with the biggest hurdle of overcoming various 'unprecedented' health and safety requirements because no such business in Australia existed.

Having successfully jumped through legal hoops, finding a suitable site and convincing a willing landlord, the pair will open the cafe on July 30.

The idea of the cat cafe first came from a trip Mr and Mrs Loughran took on their honeymoon to Japan, where they visited a cat cafe similar to the one they are proposing

The aim of the cafe is to give people who can't own pets due to certain apartment or dwelling restrictions, the opportunity to interact with the animals

'The permission for the animals depended on the landlord, and when we struck an agreement, the next challenge came from the city council,' she said.

'Because it was a first in Australia, they had to create strict regulations for us so there was a lot of back and forth.

Among the terms of the deal was that cats where to be kept strictly kept on-site, and that they couldn't be 'adopted' out.
