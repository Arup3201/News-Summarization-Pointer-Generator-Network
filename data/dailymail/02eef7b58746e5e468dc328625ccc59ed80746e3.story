A dog deliberately scalded and left for dead in a canal has now been trained to sit in the shade and uses his own special sun cream to protect his damaged skin.

In a horrific case of animal cruelty four months ago, Colin, a Staffordshire bull terrier, was scalded, left in ‘burning agony’ and dumped in a canal in Rotherham, South Yorkshire.

His skin and fur were completely burnt off his neck and back in the attack which rescuers believe could have been done with hot water or oil.

But the seven-year-old’s life has been turned around, thanks to animal charity Rain Rescue and a caring new owner.

He now spends his days raiding kitchen bins, scoffing blackberries, and larking around in Morecambe with new owner Mari Preston.

The former nurse, 55, was touched by Colin’s plight after seeing an appeal to help pay for his vets’ fees in a dog magazine.

She said: 'I was horrified, this kind of thing seems to be happening all the time. Colin was on my mind all the time, and I couldn’t get him off it, so in the end I said I would take him.

'I’ve always had Staffordshire bull terriers so I know the breed really well, and as I am also an ex-nurse I was able to give him continuing care.

'In the first couple of days he was a bit stressed, especially at night, but I bought him a ThunderShirt which is like a big hug and then there was no problem.'

Colin was picked up from Rain Rescue in June after staff there helped him to recover.

He now has a new playmate in fellow Staffordshire bull terrier Safi and has been trained to sit in the shade to keep the sun off his scar where he was scalded.

Every day he has Manuka honey and suncream rubbed into the wound and on especially hot days he also wears a vest for extra protection from the sun.

But he has yet to experience the sea, as dogs are not allowed on local beaches between May and September.

His new owner added: 'Colin has fitted in perfectly – he hasn’t got a bad bone in his body and is a real softy. He’s definitely got a mischievous streak in him though and is a really fun dog.

'He raids bins and basically emptied the kitchen one, so now I put everything outside. But that’s the only bad thing I have come across in him.

'Colin also loves blackberries. I have some at the bottom of my garden and he goes down every day. The other day I thought, "Oh my God, what’s happened to his scar?", but it was just covered in blackberry juice.'

Jacquie Nielson, who runs the Rain Rescue centre in Sheffield and Rotherham, said she had never before seen a case of animal cruelty as bad as Colin's.

'Colin was in absolute burning agony because the burns were so severe, I don’t know whether they were third degree burns, but they had taken all the layer of skin off.

'It isn’t just this one dog, we are rammed full of neglect and cruelty cases.

'South Yorkshire is a cruelty hotspot and rescue centres are collapsing all the time. There is no other place this dog could have been taken to but us - he would have ended up in kennels.'
