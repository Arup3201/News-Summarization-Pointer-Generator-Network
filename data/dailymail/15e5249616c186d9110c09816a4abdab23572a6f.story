Ruled out: French experts have ruled out a theory that Yasser Arafat was killed by poisoning, according to a source close to the investigation into his death

French experts have ruled out a theory that Yasser Arafat was killed by poisoning, according to a source close to the investigation into the Palestinian leader's 2004 death.

'The report rules out the poisoning theory and goes in the sense of a natural death,' the source told AFP.

The French experts' findings differ significantly from those of Swiss scientists, who said last month that their research offered some support for the suggestion Arafat was killed by polonium poisoning.

Rumours and speculation have surrounded Arafat's death since a quick deterioration of his health saw his passing at a military hospital near Paris in November 2004 at the age of 75.

French doctors were unable to say what killed him and an autopsy was never performed, at the request of his widow.

Many Palestinians believed he was poisoned by Israel -- a claim repeatedly denied by the Jewish state.

Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said the results of the French probe were 'no surprise'.

France opened a formal murder inquiry into his death in August 2012, a month after an Al-Jazeera documentary linked his death to polonium poisoning.

Some 60 samples were taken from 
Arafat's remains in November 2012 and divided between Swiss and Russian 
investigators and a French team carrying out a probe at his widow's 
request.

Results: Last month his widow Suha Arafat,Â  claimed he had been assassinated after tests carried out by Swiss experts found the Palestinian leader had unexpectedly high levels of the radioactive substance in his body

Both the 
prosecutors' office in the Paris suburb of Nanterre, which is conducting
 the French probe, and a lawyer for Arafat's widow Suha refused to 
comment on the investigation's findings Tuesday.

The
 Swiss team said the test results neither confirmed nor denied polonium 
was the actual source of his death, although they provided 'moderate' 
backing for the idea he was poisoned by the rare and highly radioactive 
element.

They said the quantity of the deadly substance found on his remains pointed to the involvement of a third party.

The remains of Yasser Arafat were exhumed from his grave in November 2012 so international forensic experts could search for additional clues to his death

Work underway: In November 2012, workers began prying open the concrete-encased tomb in Arafat's former government headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah

Russia's Federal Medical-Biological Agency (FMBA) has yet to release its findings.

A
 report by news agency Interfax in October quoted its chief Vladimir 
Uiba as saying Arafat 'could not have been poisoned by polonium' but the
 medical agency later denied he had made any statement.

Palestinian
 Justice Minister Ali Mhanna last month urged France to release the 
results of its probe, saying the Palestinians were sure Arafat had been 
poisoned and that Israel was the 'only suspect' in his death.

Today a Palestinian investigator said he would soon name the people he believed were responsible for the death almost a decade after he started searching for suspects.

Many Palestinians have long believed Israel killed him - a charge Israel flatly denies - but an official Palestinian Authority investigation headed by Tawfiq Tirawi has yet to produce any evidence.

'I promise that the next press conference will be the last, and will cast into the light of day everyone who perpetrated, took part in or conspired in the matter,' Tirawi told Palestine Today television.

'We are in the last 15 minutes of the investigation,' he added.

Israeli
 President Shimon Peres, who shared the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize with 
Arafat and Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, said last month that 
the reports of polonium poisoning were unbelievable.

'If someone had wanted to get rid of Arafat, it would have been easier to do it with a bullet,' he said.

Cause of death: Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat saying goodbye as he boarded a Jordanian army helicopter to fly to Paris to seek medical treatment. Arafat died a month later in a French military hospital

The Swiss team's findings sparked fresh accusations from the Palestinians and increased tensions with Israel at a delicate time.

US-brokered
 peace talks resumed at the end of July after a three-year gap, but have
 already hit a deadlock over Israeli settlement expansion in the 
occupied West Bank on land the Palestinians want for their future state.

Arafat
 shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Israeli leaders after signing the 
landmark Oslo accords in 1993, when hopes ran high for a negotiated 
settlement to the conflict.

But
 the negotiations broke down seven years later amid bitter 
recriminations on both sides, and a bloody Palestinian intifada, or 
uprising, erupted that would eventually claim the lives of some 3,000 
Palestinians and 1,000 Israelis from 2000-2005.

Israel
 and the United States blamed Arafat for a wave of suicide bombings and 
other attacks on Israelis during the uprising, while Arafat insisted he 
was powerless to prevent Palestinians from retaliating for deadly 
Israeli military operations in the occupied territories.

Hani al-Hassan, a former aide, said 
in 2003 that he had witnessed 13 assassination attempts on Arafat's 
life, dating back to his years on the run as PLO leader.

Arafat claimed to have survived 40 attempts on his life.

Arafat narrowly escaped an Israeli air strike on his headquarters in Tunisia in 1985.

He had just gone out jogging when the bombers attacked, killing 73 people.

He escaped another attempt on his life when Israeli warplanes came close to killing him during the 182 invasion of Beirut when they hit one of the buildings they suspected he was using as his headquarters but he was not there.

In December 2001, Arafat was rushed to safety just before Israeli helicopters bombarded his compound in Ramallah with rockets.
