Parking can be the death of you in Los Angeles, especially if you happen to be driving a hearse, as mortician student Samantha Kidner has learned recently.

Kidner, 18, from Riverside, California, moved into an upscale apartment complex in South Los Angeles with her family two weeks ago, and almost immediately the complaints started about her vehicle started coming in.

Kidner is a mortuary science student at University of Southern California who drives a grey 1996 Cadillac Fleetwood federal hearse, complete with a casket in the back.

Death-mobile: Samantha Kidner, 18, a mortuary science student at USC, says the management of her building has banned her from parking her hearse on the premises of the housing complex 

Special needs: Kidner, who had multiple brain surgeries and suffers from a spinal defect that causes her to stubmle, has obtained a pemit to park in a reserved section 

Macabre business: Kidner has a twin sister who also drives a hearse; the two siblings are hoping to open a mortuary together one day 

The 18-year-old aspiring mortician also suffers from a spinal disorder, which causes her to stumble and fall, so the family have obtained a permit for Kidner to park her car in a reserved section at the apartment complex.

But the sight of the macabre motor vehicle casket has been sending shivers down the spines of Kidner’s neighbors, who have described the hearse as ‘spooky,’ saying that it has no place outside their windows.

The 18-year-old USC student told the station KTLA that she has received several notices from the management of the building asking her to remove her hearse off the premises.

‘I've been harassed several times,’ Ms Kidner claimed.

It has been suggested to Kidner that she park her vehicle next door outside a children’s orthopaedic hospital.

The writing on the wall: Kidner says she has been harassed about her ghoulish 1996 Cadillac hearse because her neighbors do not wan to see it outside their windows 

But the teenager and her mother, Denise Kidner, believe that she has been subjected to discrimination because of her car.

Kidner has a disabled twin sister who also drives a hearse. The two girls are hospin one day to open a mortuary together.

‘Why shouldn't I be able to drive my hearse that makes my life interesting for me?’ Samantha Kinder said.
