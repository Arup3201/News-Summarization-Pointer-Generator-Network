Aaron Ramsey is confident he can reproduce his show-stopping form of last season for Arsenal as he approaches full fitness following hamstring troubles that have ruined his campaign so far.

The midfielder delivered good news following the Gunners' disappointing 2-1 loss to Manchester United at the weekend - he's feeling back to his best. 

And the timing couldn't be more perfect ahead of the Gunners' Champions League meeting with Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday.

'I had a hamstring injury and it takes a few games to get back to your best,' he told Arsenal.com. 'In the last game it was the first time in a long time that I felt sharp again and felt like I was physically there. Hopefully I can continue that and have a very successful season. 

Ramsey, 23, scored three goals in the Gunners' opening four matches before being struck down again by injury and admits he's been too eager to impress with goals on his return.  

'Maybe at the beginning, yes [I was trying too hard to score],' Ramsey said. 'Now I've put that to the back of my mind and I'm focusing on other things. That will come naturally again.

'I still believe in my qualities, and I'm confident that I can show them again this year. There will be plenty more opportunities.'

In saying that, the Wales star isn't going to stop his surges forward that cause so many problems for opposing defenders.  

'I'm still going to make my runs into the box. That's my game. I also can get back and defend, and that's what I mean by saying that's the best I've felt [in a while against Manchester United]. When I got forward, I could get back in time as well.'

After their second 2-1 defeat in a row, Ramsey admits Arsene Wenger's camp is disappointed, especially at missing out on the rewards for what they thought was an improved performance. But they're looking forward rather than back with Dortmund en route to the Emirates.

'It was very frustrating afterwards because we felt like we played a good game and had plenty of opportunities to score,' he said of the United loss. 'On another day they may have gone in, but I think it is important not to get too down about that.

'We played well and we have to continue to play in the way we believe we should. We are looking forward to the game against Dortmund now.'
