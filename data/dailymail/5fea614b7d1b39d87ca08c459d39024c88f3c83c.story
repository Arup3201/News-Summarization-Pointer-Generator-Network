The first thing 2-year-old Ireland Nugent did when she woke up from anesthesia a week after a horrific lawn mower accident was ask her parents what happened to her bandaged hand.

'You had a boo-boo,' her mother, Nicole, answered.

On Wednesday, the toddler from Palm Harbor, Florida, began her full day of consciousness after a battery of surgeries. According to her family, little Ireland does not appear to fully acknowledge yet  that both her legs had been severed below the knee and that her left hand was left injured.

Tragedy struck last week when the girl's father, Jerry, was riding his lawn mower in their backyard when he backed up and ran over his daughter, who wandered next to the machine.

Harrowing ordeal: Ireland, seen in the hospital with her parents, had to undergo four surgeries in a week

Outpouring of support: Since Ireland's accident, friends and complete strangers alike have been donating money to the family and sending presents and balloons (right) to cheer up the injured little girl

Heartbreaking outcome: doctors had not amputate Ireland's shredded legs below the knee to prevent infection and put her on the path to recovery

Since the accident, the local 
community has rallied around the Nugents, with donations pouring in from
friends and strangers alike wanting to help the sweet little girl in 
her awful predicament.    

'I just didn't know people could care that much,' Jerry Nugent told Tampa Bay Times, marveling at the outpouring of support or his family.

Former professional wrestler Steve Chamberland, who also lost a leg in a bike accident, approached the Nugents and vowed to help Ireland with the cost of prosthetics and physical therapy through his foundation, 50legs.org

Readers who wish to donate money for Ireland's recovery can do so by going on the site of Trinity Presbyterian Church.

The church also set up the Ireland Nugent Support Facebook Page for well-wishers.

Little Ireland had to undergo four surgeries to clean her wounds and amputate of her shredded legs at mid-calf.

While her body has likely been permanently altered by the ordeal, her loved ones say the toddler's spirit has not been broken.

After being taken off sedatives Wednesday, the girl appeared happy, chatting with her parents and laughing. Loved ones say she even ate a banana and some cereal, and drank apple juice.

'She
spilled her Fruit Loops — that was just the funniest thing in the world
to her. She burst out laughing,' said Pastor Dennis Reid, from Trinity 
Presbyterian, who has been with the Nugents at the hospital.

Mighty spirit: Minutes after waking up from being sedated, Ireland was chatting with her parents and laughing

Bright future: Doctors plan to fit the toddler with prosthetic legs in a few weeks once her wounds dry and heal

Ireland, who is still connected to monitors and other medical equipment, was even rolled out of the pediatric intensive care unit for a tour of a hospital game room. Her father said his daughter really wanted to get up and play.

The girl's family say that once Ireland’s wounds dry and heal, which could take six to eight weeks, she will be fitted for prosthetic legs.

As his daughter's small but resilient body is beginning to bounce back from the injuries, her father is struggling to come to terms with the guilt as he continues to be haunted by traumatic memories. 

'I've been fighting that. It's been an internal battle since the accident — all the things I could have done differently,' he told the paper. Then I realize I have to go forward. I can't go back.

'Everybody's been telling me not to blame myself. It's easier said than done, obviously. There's times when I'm alone, and I get myself in trouble, when I've been thinking too much.'

Speaking to ABC Action News earlier this week, Jerry Nugent tearfully recounted the devastating 15 seconds that changed their lives forever.

He explained that he thought Ireland was on the back porch behind a locked screen door whle he was riding on the mower. 

'She called my name out and I said, "Honey, I will be in in a minute, thinking that she could not get out.

Victim: Ireland Nugent, 2, lost both of her feet and part of an arm in the Wednesday accident

United front: After initially being treated for hysteria following the accident, Nicole and Jeremiah Nugent stood by each other during a press conference on Thursday

'But next thing you know, I am in the
driveway and I am blowing off the driveway and my wife comes out and 
there was a miscommunication with the hand signals and that is when my 
world came to an end,' he said.

Mr Nugent said he could actually feel the blades slice into his daughter's flesh. Afterwards, the parents said the little girl asked them where her legs were, indicating that she knew something terrible had happened.

When Ireland woke up Wednesday, Jerry
Nugent said he was hoping that her first words would be, 'Daddy, I love
you.' That did not happen yet, but he got the next back thing.

'I asked can I have a kiss and she 
put her heads up towards me and put her lips out and I was able to give 
her a kiss and that was touching,' he said.

Accident: Jeremiah Nugent, 47, was pulling into his garage to park the ride-on lawnmower when he reversed after seeing his wife wave to tell him he was going to run over something

During a press conference after the 
accident, Ireland's mother, Nicole, told reporters: 'She will continue 
to succeed. She will do great things in her life. This will not stop 
Ireland.'

Police said the father, 47-year-old 
Jeremiah 'Jerry' Nugent, was going to park the mower into the garage at 
the family's Palm Harbor, Florida home at around 7pm last Wednesday.

He is said to have not noticed that his daughter had tripped behind the machine, and he only realized that something may be wrong when he saw his wife was alerting him that he was about to drive over something.

The Pinellas County Sheriff's Office says the man responded by putting the mower in reverse, running over his daughter.

According to police, the father dragged the little girl down the driveway of their subdivision and onto the street before he realized what had happened.

Once he did, Mr Nugent immediately turned off the mower, and the woman called 911.

Authorities say the child's feet were severed above the ankles. Her left hand was punctured but intact.

She was airlifted to Tampa General Hospital with her distraught parents where she is undergoing treatment.

Pastor Dennis told MailOnline in an email Thursday that doctors placed a pin in Ireland's broken thumb and her hand is expected to make a full recovery.

Support: The family's pastor stood with them as they spoke to reporters outside of the Tampa hospital, telling how their neighbors have created a fund to pay for Ireland's prosthetic limbs

Police told ABC News that it will not be possible for the girl's limbs to be reattached, but her mother told a group of reporters that their neighbors have banded together and begun raising funds so that the Nugents will be able to pay for prosthetic limbs for Ireland.

'Never in my life did I think this would happen to my child,' Mrs Nugent said according to NBC News.

She was taken to Tampa General Hospital. The girl's parents were treated at the hospital for hysteria immediately after the incident, but showed a positive, united front alongside their family pastor during the press conference.
