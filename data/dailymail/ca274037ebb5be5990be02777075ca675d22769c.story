If you've ever wanted a tour of Liberty Island and its neighbour, Ellis Island, without actually having to go to New York, you'll soon be able to do just that.

Google Maps has finally been given permission to map Ellis and Liberty Islands so that tourists can take virtual tours of both historic landmarks.

Google's Street View 360-degree maps have been available for most of New York City since 2007, but Liberty and Ellis Island have never been mapped until now, mainly because getting access to Liberty Island, which is run by the National Park Service, has been complicated.

A lengthy approvals process had to be waded through before filming could commence, a Google Maps spokesman explained.

But now the company has finally begun its mapping project of the islands with Google Maps image collector Alberto Elias wearing a Trekker backpack, accompanied by Google technologist, Daniel Sieberg, visiting the islands last week.

The Trekker is a Google Street View device used to collect data and imagery which enables Google to create a street view map of hard-to-access locations around the world.

In addition to 15 cameras, the apparatus has a GPS device and a laser system used to measure the distance to objects. 

Slowly does it: Strapped into the Google Trekker device, Elias captures images for Google Street View

'For the first time, Liberty Island will be available for people to explore through Street View in Google Maps,' Sieberg told the New York Times.

'So whether you’re a tourist or a New Yorker or someone who just wants to see it up close, in the coming months everyone will be able to take a tour of the island and appreciate the statue’s history and beauty in 360-degree imagery.'

But don't hold your breath: Google needs to process the images before they go live online. The footage is filed and processed, and during this procedure, faces and private information are blurred - a process which usually takes months.

The search giant has been using cars, bikes and people to carry camera systems though all sorts of landmarks so they can be toured virtually, and the Statue of Liberty is sure to be a popular 'destination' for virtual tourists.

Google Street View includes images from 57 countries and has covered more than five million miles across seven continents, and the Trekker has also been used to map the Eiffel Tower, the Grand Canyon and Mount Fuji.
