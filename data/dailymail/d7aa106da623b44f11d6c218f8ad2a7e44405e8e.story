Three days after claiming she was down to her last £200, it was revealed today that former Apprentice winner Stella English has a property portfolio worth £1million and pays a firm up to £1,000 a week to manage her public relations.

The mother-of-two this week said she was trying to claim benefits as she fought off a claim by Lord Sugar, who was trying to win £35,000 in legal costs and damages.

Miss English, 34, said just three years after she found fame on the BBC1 show, she could lose one of her homes and her marriage had collapsed.

Former Apprentice winner Stella English said she had fallen into poverty at a tribunal this week. It has now been reported she spends up to £4,000 a month on PR

It has now been reported she pays PR firm Big Talent Group up to £4,000 a month and owns two flats and a house in South London worth £1million, according to The Mirror.

The paper reported Land Registry deeds revealed Miss English bought the first flat in 2005 for £250,000 and the second for £245,000 in 2007. Both were expected to be worth more now.

Senior talent agent Terry Mills, of Big Talent Group, declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline today.

Lord Sugar had been seeking to recover £35,000 after Miss English lost her constructive dismissal case against him earlier this year.

Miss English wept earlier this week when an East London Tribunal Service panel ruled that she should not have to repay any of the money.

At the original employment tribunal, Lord Sugar claimed Miss English knowingly lied when she said the £100,000-a-year job at his firm, which she won through the BBC programme in 2010, was a sham.

Recently, she claimed she was making 
double that amount from new business ventures, including a fashion label
and an events company.

But at the hearing this week it emerged that the mother of two has not worked since July and is attempting to claim housing benefit and jobseeker’s allowance.

She said that she worked at Citigroup until July, earning £500 a day, but her contract with the banking giant had ended.

She is also facing the prospect of having one of her homes repossessed and has seen her marriage collapse as a result of the stress of the original case.

Miss English told the tribunal that she now only has around £200 in her bank account and was unable to even afford a birthday present for her son.

‘I cannot afford to feed my kids let alone pay the mortgage – that doesn’t even matter any more,’ she said. ‘It is my son’s birthday today but I can’t afford to buy him anything because everything we have goes on trying to survive.

‘A couple of weeks ago I made an application for housing benefit and there is an interview set up. I have no choice.

'Unless I find a contract I will not be able to support my family any more, I am losing close to 3k a month.’

Lawyers for 66-year-old Lord Sugar insisted Miss English brought the original legal action against him simply because she was ‘bored’ with her day job and missed the glamour of appearing on television.

But tribunal judge George Foxwell rejected his application to recover some of his costs, saying that Miss English truly believed she had a case.
