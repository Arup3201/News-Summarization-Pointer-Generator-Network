Hero: Kevin Williams helped Bob King when King was stuck inside a locked vehicle

'We've had a little problem with the switch on this car about opening up,' he said.

'I hollered at [Kevin] and he just looked at me kind of funny, you know, and I said "Yeah I'm locked in here,"' he added.

'I'm very thankful, I don't know how long it had been, I'd say it probably be another 20 minutes sitting in there if he hadn't notified somebody,' he also said.

Williams ran to get the attention of pastor Jack Greene, WVLT said, who helped King out of the car.

'[Kevin] kept pulling at my hand, and I eventually turned around and looked at him and said what's going on and he said "Locked, locked!"' Greene told the affiliate station.

When King got out,'his whole body was raining sweat,' Greene told ABC. 'His face was red like a pickled beet. I asked him three times: ‘Are you OK Bob?'

King, whom ABC reported has a history of serious health issues, was alright.

'He [Keith] said: ‘I saved life’ after I brought Bob inside,' Green added to ABC. 'He is such a good kid. He is an inspiration and blessing to us.'
