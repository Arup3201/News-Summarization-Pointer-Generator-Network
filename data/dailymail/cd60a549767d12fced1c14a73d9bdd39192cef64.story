The father of an 11-year-old girl who was allegedly the victim of online grooming filmed himself beating the man responsible before killing him in a gory video.

The unidentified man, who was 23, was said to have harassed the girl for several months. 

It is believed he sent pictures to her via Whatsapp and arranged to meet her in the state of Goias, Brazil.

The father of an 11-year-old girl who was allegedly the victim of online grooming filmed himself beating the man responsible before killing him in a gory video

But he had not realised he had actually been talking to the young girl's father. 

When he arrived for the supposed meeting, the man badly beat him and filmed it before killing him.  

A gory video of the attack has been posted online by the girl's father, as a 'warning that those who do wrong, have to pay for it', he said. 

In it the man can be seen bleeding heavily from a gaping wound around his mouth.  

In the video an angry exchange can be heard, with the alleged attacker swearing that he will never again try to contact the young girl.

He can barely speak as he begs for mercy and appears to be being held up by the neck by the older man.

Asked by the girl's father the man, with a swollen lip and face, pleads in Portuguese: 'Never again, never again, never again.' 

The father is said to reply:  'You will learn from this beating that you will now take you b*****d.'

The camera is then taken off the alleged predator's face. He is heard screaming before it cuts out.  

It comes days after an angry Indian mob broke into a Dimapur prison to kidnap alleged rapist Syed Faird Khan. He was stripped naked and paraded through the streets before being hung by a clock tower

Khan's brother, Syed Jamal Khan, said he was innocent and accused police of trying to falsely implicated him of rape

The young man's body was found three days later in the middle of the thicket where the beating took place, LiveLeak.com reports. 

Last year a man jailed for the rape and killing of his one-year-old son was reportedly viciously attacked by inmates at a Brazilian prison after turning himself in.

Reports claimed Daryell Dickson Meneses Xavier was stabbed in the back by fellow convicts and raped repeatedly after details of his crimes spread through the prison in Taguatinga. 

Elsewhere an Indian mob broke into a prison where a suspected rapist was being held to break him out for a public lynching this week. 

Syed Faird Khan was beaten to death and hung from a clock tower in Nagaland state after being put in a cell accused of attacking a 19-year-old student in February. 

It came after thousands were outraged by the blocking of a film about the high-profile gang rape of a student on a bus in the country in 2012.
