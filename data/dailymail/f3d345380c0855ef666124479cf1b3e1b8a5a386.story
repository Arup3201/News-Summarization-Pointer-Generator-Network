A tenant in New York City is suing his landlord and business management after he returned home one evening to find all his belongings had been cleared from his apartment and tossed in the city dump by mistake.

Nilay Sharoff, a 27-year-old consultant at Deloitte, initially feared that his prized possessions had been stolen when he returned home on October 9 to find everything - bar a TV and PS3 gaming system – gone.

Initially Nilay though he had been robbed, but when the cops arrived they told him no robber would have stolen his bed, yet left a television and PlayStation.

Next he asked the management company for 409 East 74th Street, a five-story rent controlled building on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, if they knew what had happened.

An employee admitted to Nilay that a bumbling rubbish removal contractor had mistakenly cleared his $1,700-a-month apartment, 2D, instead of the neighboring unit 2B.

‘They were like, “Oh, it’s some 80-year-old contractor, he might be a little senile,” that’s what the landlord was saying. For me, it’s like, “I don’t give a damn. It’s still your fault.”

‘I mean, there’s dirty dishes in the sink. There’s a wet towel. Clearly someone’s living there,’ he told the New York Post.

The apartment was Sharoff's first home after graduating from college and moving out of his family's house in New Jersey

Shroff is suing the management company, Mautner-Glick, his landlord and the contractor for $40,000 after he was told that his stuff would be replaced, but he still has not been compensated.

‘Plaintiff lost… clothes, kitchen items, bed, dresser, sofa and other furniture, bathroom items, video games, personal identity information… credit cards… memorabilia, photographs and souvenirs,’ states the suit.

‘My passport was here, my Social Security card, credit cards, all my bank accounts,’ said the technology consultant, who travels frequently for work.

He was also robbed of family photographs, including snaps of his mom, who passed away when he was 13 years old.

Even the dirty dishes that Sharoff had left in his sink were thrown out

‘I was distraught,’ said Nilay, who was also forced him to take a week off work to rebuild his life.

A die-hard baseball fan, Shroff was also bitterly disappointed to have lost a Mariano Rivera bobblehead, which currently sells for $400 on eBay.

The apartment was his first home after graduating from college and moving out of his family’s house in New Jersey.
