France's prime minister placed himself as a frontrunner to challenge its unpopular president as he called for the country's Left to reinvent itself or die.

In an interview with an influential news weekly, Manuel Valls accused the French left of being 'backward looking' and attached to a 'bygone' past.

His comments, published today but already widely trailed, come after President Francois Hollande slapped down Mr Valls' apparent presidential ambitions.

Barb: President Hollande reportedly told Mr Valls 'One can succeed in life without becoming president.' It was widely interpreted as a dismissal of Mr Valls' apparent ambitions to replace Mr Hollande as Socialist leader

'One can succeed in life without becoming president,' Mr Hollande was quoted by Bloomberg as saying at a traditional ceremony in which French presidents honour their PMs after six months in office.

The barb, which came soon after Mr Hollande rejected Mr Valls' proposal to reform unemployment benefits, was seen in French media as an intensification of the battle at the top level of French politics.

The feud comes as rifts plaguing the Socialist party became increasingly apparent, as a hard-Left faction takes on pro-business, neo-liberal figures like both the president and prime minister.

Hollande has been unable to stem increasingly strident dissent within his camp despite two cabinet reshuffles. Today Mr Valls called for the establishment of a new 'progressive' party or political alliance.

'We must put a stop to the backward-looking left that has become attached to a bygone and nostalgic past,' Valls said in an interview with news weekly L'Obs.

'If the left does not reinvent itself... it could die,' he warned.

'The left that gives up on reforming, that chooses to defend yesterday's solutions rather than resolve today's problems - that left is picking the wrong fight.'

He called on all 'progressive forces' in the country to put their differences aside and gather as one to drag France out of its economic quagmire.

'We must soon create a... federation or one group' of these forces, he said, without detailing who they would be..

Both Mr Valls and President Hollande have been sharply criticised by many on the left of the Socialist party for their implementing huge cuts in public spending and giving firms tax breaks in return for pledges to create jobs.

Chief among critics who see this as a form of austerity is former economy minister Arnaud Montebourg, whose public dissent got him kicked out of the government in an August emergency reshuffle and replaced by Emmanuel Macron, a former investment banker.

Former education and culture ministers Benoit Hamon and Aurelie Filippetti followed him out the door but remained MPs. This week a key parliamentary vote on France's 2015 budget was passed with a razor slim majority after they led a group of rebel Socialist lawmakers who abstained.

Mr Hamon said the government's current reformist, pro-business stance 'threatens the republic' and would play in the hands of the far-right in the 2017 presidential elections.

France has been unable to stem sky-high unemployment and kickstart growth.

The eurozone's second-biggest economy has also admitted it will be unable to get its ballooning budget deficit below the EU ceiling until 2017 - two years later than promised.

Mr Hamon warned on RFI radio that the threat was 'not only that (far-right leader) Marine Le Pen would get to the second round of elections without any resistance, but also... that soon, she will lead the country'.

The public war of words was another slap in the face for President Hollande, whose perceived inability to hold the ranks together has not helped restore his rock-bottom popularity ratings.

In his interview, Mr Valls acknowledged that bad choices were made at the beginning of the administration in 2012.

'We favoured tax (rises) over a drop in public spending,' he said, reiterating his belief in the new direction the government was taking.

Mr Valls also warned that if the left failed to reform and yield results, the far-right would be the clear winner, as witnessed already with the National Front party's good results at local and European elections earlier this year.
