At the beginning of his Friday morning pre-match press conferences, Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini habitually ticks off his injury list.

Last season, it often went something like this. ‘Micah Richards, Matija Nastastic, Jack Rodwell, Sergio Aguero.’

A voice would then pop up from the assembled press: ‘And Stevan Jovetic?’

‘Yes, Stevan, I’m not sure, maybe a couple of weeks.’

Hit and miss: Manchester City's Stevan Jovetic is looking to impress after struggling last season

This, sadly, was the narrative of Stevan Jovetic’s first season in England, the £22.4million signing from Fiorentina seeing his campaign punctuated by a series of muscle of injuries with a return date often hazy.

It all began with a hamstring problem suffered in pre-season and then came subsequent problems of a similar kind, along with calf strains and groin problems, limiting Jovetic to just two Premier League starts.

In public, Pellegrini pleaded for tolerance but behind the scenes, City could have been forgiven for wondering whether it was a psychological battle as well as a physical one for Jovetic.

Certainly, the Montenegrin was unlucky. 
On one scheduled return date in a Capital One Cup match at Leicester, he
 was struck down by a bout of food poisoning.

Frustrated figure: Jovetic just made five starts last season in all competitions due to injuries and illness

Nonetheless, when Sergio Aguero suffered a series of set-backs in the second half of the season, and Alvaro Negredo dramatically lost his gloascoring touch, it was Edin Dzeko that emerged from the shadows, with Jovetic worthy only of seven substitute appearances between the end of February and May.

Evidently, the Montenegrin has a way to go to regain the trust of Pellegrini. The manager’s apparent reservations are understandable. To strip Jovetic’s career at City down to the bare numbers, it makes for uncomfortable reading. So far, Jovetic has played just 579 minutes in the light blue of Manchester City. That works out at £38,687 per minute.

He is yet to play more than 65 minutes in a single Premier League game. The only 90 minutes he did complete came in a 5-0 victory over Wigan in the Capital One Cup. Jovetic started just five games in all competitions last season. For the record, that works out at £4.48m per game.

In one match against Stoke, he came on in the 56th minute and limped off after 69 minutes. In another at Newcastle, he managed just 10 minutes before succumbing to injury. 

In Italy, they nicknamed him Jo-Jo and times last season, some City fans may have feared that his time at the Etihad Stadium would end up as inauspicious as that of the Brazilian Jo, the former club record signing that scored just six goals for the club. 

Yet when several Italian clubs came calling for Jovetic this summer, principally Inter Milan, City rejected the approaches without a second’s hesitation.

And on Sunday evening in the United States, Jovetic reminded everybody just why sporting director Txiki Begiristain and Pellegrini were so keen to retain him. Albeit only pre-season and against an AC Milan team who appeared to be taking their inspiration for defending from Brazil’s World Cup side, Jovetic dazzled, scoring twice and it would have been three if not for the linesman’s offside flag.

Speaking before the game, Pellegrini said: ‘Stevan is working well with us. He is a very important player for our team. Maybe there are a lot of rumours about his future but Stevan will stay with us.’

Still only 24, City believe they have one of the world’s most talented forwards on their books and they hope that their perseverance will be rewarded with the kind of performances that saw Jovetic compared to Roberto Baggio and Gianfranco Zola in Italy and named as Partizan Belgrade’s youngest ever captain, aged 18, just a few years ago.

If, and it remains a significant if, Jovetic is able to stay fit, City’s patience could yet be repaid in spectacular fashion.
