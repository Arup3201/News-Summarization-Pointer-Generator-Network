Boasting nothing more than an empty, concrete shell on the top level, the 'Aurora' Soul penthouse has sold for $7 million to property tycoon, Tony Fung.

The aim of stripping the property for the sale was to attract a buyer who can stamp their personality on it.

The gamble worked. 

Mr Fung had to beat six other bidders to buy the massive four-floor apartment on the Gold Coast.

The apartment with its own opulent pool, luxury fittings and a massive stainless steel barbeque, became Australia's most expensive penthouse, in 2006 when an agreement was reached to sell it for nearly $17 million.

But the deal with Brisbane businessman Charlie Caltabiano fell through and receivers were brought in following a legal dispute.

Since then, the penthouse has been stripped of every piece of furniture, every fitting, the walls, the ceiling and even the kitchen sink.

Gutted. The living area is unrecognisable from its once grand appearance, all fittings and furnishings have been removed, even exposing the air conditioning unit - the incredible 360 view of the Gold Coast, though, is still the same 

The previous fit-out is long gone as the Soul Penthouse prepares to go under the hammer

The Soul Penthouse is one of the stand-out buildings along the Gold Coast skyline

The 63-year-old Hong Kong businessman is no foreigner to expanses in need of some love.

He is planning to develop an $8.15 billion 'Aquis' casino and resort in Yorkey's Knob, Cairns, causing much controversy among locals.

McGrath agent James Ledgerwood told The Courier Mail that this high profile buyer will attract a lot of attention to the Soul building.

'Given the new owner and his expectations, it's safe to say it will become one of the icons of penthouses in Australia.'

Ledgerwood also added that spaces like this one are unique due to their versatility.  

'There's not much left from how we found it,' James Ledgerwood admitted. The interior as shown in a catalogue is in stark contrast to what is there today awaiting Mr Fung's personal touch

Today: The bare bones living area. 'It's unique, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for buyers - we stripped it right back to a shell, that includes the limestone floors and the kitchen too' Mr Ledgerwood of selling agents McGrath told Daily Mail Australia

'It's similar to buying a vacant house lot, but 220 metres up in the sky and with the highest swimming pool in Queensland,' he said.

A spokesperson for Mr. Fung said that he was ecstatic with the recent purchase. 

'It is a vote of confidence in the Queensland economy and an important addition to his property holdings in the state,' he said.

Fung already owns 447 hectares worth of properties in the Gold Coast hinterland as well as an Innisfail farm, a private golf course in Noosa and he purchased Casino Canberra in December.

Agent James Legerwood had previously told Daily Mail Australia that this property was a rare gem, particularly on the Gold Coast in Australia. 

He and co-partner John Natoli were brought in, with a clear brief, take whatever measures are needed to sell it.

McGrath Broadbeach selling agent James Ledgerwood. He says the new appeal of this four-level 1040 square metre property 'is that it is very, very rare that anyone gets a chance to put a penthouse together the way they want, particularly here on the Gold Coast'

As it once was. The luxurious pool-side look (above) has gone to make way for a new look from new owners. The current version (below) shows Queensland's highest positioned pool and spa, but little else

They took one look at the apartment which set a record when sold at $16.85m in 2006 and decided to get rid of the old fit-out

'Look, we had to admit that it (the fit-out) that was there was not very appealing, so we decided that it needed to be ripped up.' 

'It's unique, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for buyers - we want to sell this penthouse, so we began by stripping it right back to a shell, that includes the limestone floor and the kitchen too,' Mr Ledgerwood added.

The Soul Penthouse starts on level 70 and winds its way up four levels.

'There's not much left from how we found it,' he said.

At least the BBQ is still in place. One of the biggest talking points all along for the Soul Penthouse has been the swimming pool and spa area, the highest of their kind anywhere in Queensland

Eight car spaces are provided down below and even that area had been cleared out prior to the auction

However, Ledgerwood added it had some serious appeal. 

It's position at more than 220 metres above the ground, four levels (70-73), boasting 'the highest swimming pool and spa in Queensland', no less than eight secure basement car spaces (which have also had fittings removed) and 'full resort facilities including pools, gym and gardens'.

'This will give them (buyers) the opportunity to create their own vision and take advantage of some of the most spectacular views in Australia, and create a residence of world-class standing.' he said.

'You have spectacular views - out to the Hinterland to the west, you look east out to the ocean, then up to Stradbroke (Island) in the north and all the way down to Coolangatta down south, to be fair the previous lay-out did not do that justice.'   

The auction that saw Tony Fung one more Australian property richer, took place on March 7. 

Dream views. 'You look up to Stradbroke (Island) and all the way down to Coolangatta down south, to be fair the previous lay-out did not do that justice' said Mr Ledgerwood

With views like this, it's little wonder Mr Ledgewood claims 'there has been plenty of local and international interest' about Aurora - the Soul Penthouse on the Gold Coast which had been stripped bare
