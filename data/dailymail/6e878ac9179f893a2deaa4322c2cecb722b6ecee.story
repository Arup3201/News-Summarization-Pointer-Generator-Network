Political aspirations: Real estate mogul Donald Trump may run for New York Governor if Republicans unify behind him

Donald Trump says he's prepared to run for New York Governor this year if the state's Republicans can unify behind him.

The real estate mogul met with about 50 elected GOP officials and county chairmen yesterday for about two hours to hear their pitch for why he should challenge Democrat Governor Andrew Cuomo.

Trump told the group assembled at his Fifth Avenue headquarters he would only represent a unified party, with an insider telling NY1 'The Donald' is 90 percent set on running.

Trump told The Buffalo News that if he had the party's support, 'I would do it, and I think I'd win.'

'But I don’t want to see a divided party because it’s a tough enough race already,' he said.

'The Apprentice' host did not define the meaning of a 
unified party but suggested party leaders would have to embrace his campaign.

He will decide by the end of January or beginning of February whether to run.

Sources said the billionaire developer was considering funding his own campaign, spending up to $35 million of 
his own money to boost his chances.

'The Republican Party through Donald Trump has a very significant chance of defeating Cuomo and really seeing a Governor Donald Trump,' Michael Cohen, special counsel to Donald Trump, said.

In an interview with the The Buffalo 
News, Trump appeared to imply he would have a good chance against 
'politically vulnerable' Cuomo. 

'I am giving it very, very serious consideration, and if everything falls into place I would do it,' he said.

Trump claims Cuomo is vulnerable on everything from tax policy to a massive bridge construction project downstate.

However New York Daily News reported some insiders claim Trump has no intention of running, but is just milking the publicity.

'We've seen this movie before,' an insider told the paper.

Meanwhile, state GOP Chairman Ed Cox has reportedly been promoting the candidacy of Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino, who is considering a run.

Astorino backers don't believe Trump is serious about running for governor.

At this point, there are no declared 
Republican candidates for governor, nor has Cuomo 
officially announced that he will seek re-election.
