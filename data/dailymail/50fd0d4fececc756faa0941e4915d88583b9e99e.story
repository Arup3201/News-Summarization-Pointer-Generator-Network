This carefree selfie 
of a mother and son smiling into the camera was taken aboard the doomed 
Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, it is claimed.

Gary
 Slok, 15, and his mother Petra Langeveld both lost their lives when a 
missile shot down the Amsterdam-Kuala Lumpur plane as it flew over 
eastern Ukraine.

The pair were heading to a holiday designed for single parents and their children.

But just three hours after apparently posing for this picture, they were killed alongside 296 other passengers and crew members.

Tragic: Dutch teenager Gary Slok, 15, poses with his mother Petra Langeveld in a selfie apparently taken aboard doomed flight MH17 moments before they took off from Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport

Gary, a goalkeeper for 
his local football club in Maassluis, western Holland, was one of 80 
youngsters who lost their lives in the horror crash on Thursday.

He was described by teammates as 'wonderful'.

A
 statement released by the club said: 'Gary and his mum Petra were on 
their way to Malaysia to have the dream holiday of their life.

'Sadly they never got the chance to fulfil that dream.

'But his story and his last picture tell you how dreams of many people with wonderful lives ahead of them have been wrecked.'

Images of 22 other children killed in the crash - just a quarter of the total dead - have emerged today.

Australian mother Rin Norris lost her father Nick and her three children Mo, 12, Evie, ten and eight-year-old Otis.

The children were flying
 home with their grandfather after a family holiday in Europe, while 
Miss Norris and partner Anthony Maslin stayed in Amsterdam for a few 
extra days.

Three babies
 were among the dead, including 21-month-old Kaela Goes, killed with her
 parents as they flew home to Malaysia after visiting relatives in 
Holland.

Two families from the same street in the Netherlands were also killed.

Tess
 and Liv Trugg, aged ten and eight, and their neighbour Sem Wels, ten, 
died with their parents en route to a holiday in Bali.

Five-year-old
 Martin Paulissen and his sister Sri, three, died with their parents as 
they travelled to visit their grandmother’s grave in Indonesia.

A Malaysian family of six – including four children aged 13 to 19 – were killed as they journeyed home together.

And among the dead were the sons of British banker Andrew Hoare and his Dutch wife Estella.

The 59-year-old from Frome, Somerset, was taking his sons Friso, 12, and Jasper, 15, trekking in the rainforest of Borneo.

Another
 British father John Allen, 44, died with his Dutch wife Sandra and 
their three sons Ian, Julian and Christopher, aged eight to 16, as they 
travelled to Indonesia.

Today,
 the bodies of the 298 passengers and crew members were finally 
retrieved from the crash site in eastern Ukraine and loaded into a 
refrigerated train.

Three
 days after the disaster, negotiations are still ongoing to repatriate 
the bodies amid claims they are being held by pro-Russian separatists as
 a bargaining tool.
