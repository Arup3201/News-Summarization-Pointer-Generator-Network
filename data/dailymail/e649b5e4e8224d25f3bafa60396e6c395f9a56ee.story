Police forces are appealing for motorist's dashcam footage in a bid to catch dangerous drivers.

Dashboard-mounted cameras, which cost around £70 to install, are used by thousands of drivers in the UK. Many use them to protect against false claims or insurance premiums.

But now forces are planning to make the 
most of the cameras - and are appealing for drivers to send in footage 
of other motorists breaking the law.

Appeal: Police are calling for drivers to submit their dashcam footage - such as this series which captured a driver hitting an elderly man - so they can catch more dangerous drivers

Hit: The 75-year-old man can be seen stepping out into the road while the driver speeds forward

Justice: The motorist - who was driving near Heathrow - was prosecuted and disqualified

Some cameras have already been used to catch dangerous drivers.

Shocking footage taken by one driver in Southall, Heathrow, of a driver hitting an elderly man and then driving off led to a prosecution.

The driver of a red vehicle can been seen speeding along for several minutes before attempting to overtake another motorist on a single carriageway.

Crash: A Surrey police car can be seen stopped in the middle of a single carraigeway

Smash: The driver of a blue BMW then piles into the side of the car

Hit: The officer is sent flying and both cars are badly damaged

The footage shows the man stepping in to the road and the driver hitting him - before speeding off.

The driver was disqualified thanks to the video.

Other videos taken of dangerous UK drivers show a HGV narrowly avoiding a pile up on the A13 towards Dagenham.

The distracted driver can be seen travelling along in the slow lane before swerving to avoid hitting another HGV.

Lorry: The green Artic lorry (left) can be seen travelling along in the slow lane

Near miss: The driver then swerves around another lorry and into a white truck

Dangerous: The white lorry is then forced to swerve into the central reservation

The lorry then narrowly misses another vehicle in the dramatic video.

Meanwhile in Surrey - dashcam footage shows a police car easing out of a junction and an officer getting out of the vehicle.

Moments later a BMW, driving at some speed, smashes into the side of the police car - sending the officer flying.

Stupid: The driver of a black KA can be seen attempting to U-turn at a busy junction

Dangerous: The driver then almost reverses into a motorist behind

Turn: The driver eventually makes their way back down the road

Other footage shows a lorry not moving over when a car attempts to join a dual carriageway and a driver of a Ford KA doing a u-turn in the middle of a busy junction.

Paul Marshall from the Association of Chief Police Officers told The Times: 'Increasing use is being made by the public of digital cameras to record evidence of offences which can be used by the police service to support prosecutions.'

Matt Stockdale of PoliceWitness.com - a 
site that helps drivers submit footage to police - said: 'PoliceWitness.com is merely a conduit that helps the public assist the police.

'The incidents we report to the police are from members of the public who have inadvertently captured acts of inconsiderate or dangerous driving on their dash cams, set up to record their journeys whilst they go about their daily business.

'The main reason dash cams are a growing phenomenon, is people recognise the need to protect themselves, their vehicle, their insurance costs and their driving licence, which in some cases could mean their livelihood.'
