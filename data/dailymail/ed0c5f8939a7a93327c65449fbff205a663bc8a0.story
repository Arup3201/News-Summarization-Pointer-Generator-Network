An Amish teenager allegedly led police on a buggy chase after they spotted him drinking beer in the vehicle.

Lewis Hostetler, 17, was seen driving the buggy while holding a can of beer on Monday at 1am by sheriffâ€™s deputies on patrol, police said.

Officers attempted to stop the buggy in Conewango, New York, but Hostetler allegedly led them on a short chase before pulling over.

Hostetler has been charged with a host of offences including resisting 
arrest and second-degree obstructing governmental administration.

He is also charged with unlawful possession of an alcoholic beverage with intent to consume by a person under age 21, reported the Buffalo News.

Three more charges from the incident include failure to yield to an 
emergency vehicle, insufficient tail lamps and littering on a highway.

He was arraigned in Randolph Town Court and taken to jail on $500 bail.

Hostetler will face charges in Conewango Town Court, which is more than 50 miles south of Buffalo, at a later date.

It comes after a study showed cheaper farmland and proximity to 
population centres are fuelling growth in Amish colonies in New York.

The Amish, many of them from Ohio or Pennsylvania, have set up 10 new 
settlements in New York since 2010 - growth that doubles other states.

That population has grown by nearly a third in two years, to 13,000. As 
recently as 1991, there were just 3,900 Amish in the state.

The first New York Amish districts were established in the Conewango 
Valley in 1949, but in-migration slowed until about 10 years ago.

Pennsylvania had the nation's largest Amish population in the new survey, at just over 61,000, and New York was fifth.
