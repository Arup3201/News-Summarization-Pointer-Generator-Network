Almost half of all eight year olds and a third of children aged five have fillings or teeth missing because of tooth decay.

Furthermore in 2013, 46 per cent of 15 year olds and 34 per cent of 12 year olds had 'obvious decay' in their permanent teeth.

While high those figures do represent a slight reduction over the course of a decade, when the comparable figures were 56 per cent and 43 per cent respectively.

The latest figures, published by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, reveals children are so embarrassed by their rotting teeth that they try to avoid smiling or laughing.

The Child Dental Health Survey has revealed almost half of all eight year olds and a third of children aged five have fillings or teeth missing because of tooth decay

The survey of more than 13,500 children and nearly 10,000 dental examinations found dental decay was most pronounced in lower income families - where children are eligible for free school meals. 

Of those a sample size of 9,866 were surveyed and underwent an examination.

Around 40 per cent of five year olds from more deprived families had tooth decay, compared with 29 per cent from less deprived families.

In addition, 59 per cent of 15 year olds from deprived families had tooth decay, compared with 43 per cent from better off families. 

Meanwhile Northern Ireland is uncovered as the childhood tooth decay capital of the UK, with 72 per cent of 15 year olds suffering oral disease.

In England that figure is 44 per cent, and Wales it is 63 per cent.

But while remaining high, the levels have fallen since 2003 when the comparable figures were 78 per cent, 55 per cent and 65 per cent, respectively.

The Child Dental Health Survey reveals a promising trend, experts said, with the extend and severity of tooth decay in permanent teeth of children aged 12 and 15 falling.

The Child Dental Health Survey examined the prevalence, severity and extent of dental caries, also known as tooth decay.

Each tooth is classified based on how decayed it is.

Three components qualify as  different levels of decay.

They are:

But they warned large swathes of the childhood population 'continue to be affected by disease, and the burden of disease is substantial in those children that have it'. 

Tooth decay was still found in 34 per cent of 12-year-olds (compared to 43 per cent in 2003) and 46 per cent of 15-year-olds (56 per cent in 2003). 

Just 38 per cent of children were classed as having good overall oral health, meaning they had no obvious decay, no tooth surface loss into the dentine, which is the layer under the tooth enamel, and no tartar. 

In July the HSCIC published figures that showed the number of admissions for dental problems, among five to nine year olds rose from 22,574 in 2010-11 to 25,812 in 2013-14. 

Acting chief dental officer for NHS England Serbjit Kaur said: 'These results are very encouraging and are a credit to the dental profession and all those who promote dental health.

'There have been significant reductions in the numbers of 12 and 15-year-olds with obvious decay in their adult teeth.

'Future progress requires further work on prevention and a joined-up approach to dental care and wider health and social care services for children, as set out in the Five Year Forward View.'

The survey also highlighted how girls are better at brushing their teeth, with 69 per cent of boys aged 12 saying they brush at least twice a day, compared to 85 per cent of girls.  

Sugary drinks were also found to be a cause for concern, with 16 per cent of 12 year olds and 14 per cent of 15 year olds saying they drink the beverages at least four times a day.

The 2013 survey is the fifth in a series of national children's dental health surveys that have been carried out every ten years since 1973, focusing on the dental health of five, eight, 12 and 15 year olds in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Dr Sandra White, director of dental public health at Public Health England (PHE), said: 'PHE welcomes the overall fall in tooth decay levels and the fact that more and more children are brushing their teeth twice a day and regularly visiting the dentist.

'However, children from low-income families are twice as likely to have tooth decay, which is not only painful but can require hospital treatment and also affects their confidence and self-esteem, so there is no room for complacency.

'Tooth decay is a serious, preventable disease and this survey echoes the need to urgently reduce the amount of sugary snacks and drinks in our children's diets.'

Anna Bradley, chair of Healthwatch England, said: 'Tooth decay is preventable as long as parents have the right information about and access to NHS dentists.

'Yet we know from local Healthwatch research into dentist access that some parents can't find a dentist who will treat their children on the NHS and others don’t know when to take their child to the dentist.

'It seems that, as a result, children with tooth decay are increasingly needing emergency dental treatments in hospital.

'Last year alone 26,000 five-nine year olds required emergency dental surgery.

'It’s crucial that information about which dentists are available to NHS patients is up-to-date and there is good information for parents about how to care for their children's teeth.

'This means decay can be prevented and there is no need resort to emergency A&E treatments when decay has already set in.'
