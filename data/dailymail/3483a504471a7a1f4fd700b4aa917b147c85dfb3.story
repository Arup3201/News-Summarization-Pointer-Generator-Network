Blackpool find themselves in the farcical situation whereby they have just eight professionals and have had to cancel a pre-season tour to La Manga.

With just 25 days to go until their Championship season gets underway at Nottingham Forest, chairman Karl Oyston and new manager Jose Riga are locked in a stand-off over transfer targets.

Riga has only been in charge of the Seasiders for five weeks - the only signing to date being Estonian striker Sergei Zenjov - but there is no sign of either side backing down and tensions remain high.

Defender Tony McMahon penned a new deal to make him the sole out-of-contract player to remain.

Teenage centre-back Harrison McGahey - an impressive performer in keeping the club up last season - looks set for a move to League One Sheffield United, while there are a host of players on trial, including former Chelsea midfielder Jacob Mellis, at the dilapidated training ground Squires Gate.

They were due to fly out to La Manga on Sunday for a nine-day trip but have called it off through a lack of players, shining a light on the shambolic circumstances currently engulfing the Fylde Coast side.

It throws up yet more questions as to how Riga goes about preparing for the new campaign, given a friendly against Penrith on Saturday and then another when Burnley visit on August 2 are the only matches planned.

Keeping calm: Chairman Karl Oyston says there's no need to panic

Oyston, however, is convinced that nothing is wrong at Bloomfield Road - even though the new boss is still yet to give any sort of press conference or media briefing since taking over.

‘There is no panic,’ he told BBC Sport. ‘In fact, I see it as a benefit rather than a downside. It allows the manager to bring in his own team, as opposed to a manager picking up a squad that is already overloaded and he doesn't think is good enough.’

The manager handed Oyston a sizeable list of up to 50 targets to enquire about last month and has seen minimal return.

News of the tour cancellation is just another sorry chapter in the recent history of a side who just three years ago were in the Premier League and only suffered relegation on the final day.

As well as that, Sam Oyston - who runs the club’s loss-making hotel - tweeted about spending the afternoon pigeon shooting alongside brother George inside the stadium. The tweet was later deleted.

The lack of a squad and - gallingly - a goalkeeper is an obvious cause for concern but there is a further undercurrent of discontent behind the scenes.

The Oyston family, who have recently openly mocked fans, have paid themselves and companies they own £26million since the club’s unexpected rise to the top flight, with supporters protesting angrily towards the end of last season in the first show of overt dissent against the ownership in years.

Sportsmail understands that club president Valeri Belokon, whose combined loan of £7.2m to the club still hasn’t been repaid and helped sign players plus build a stand, is growing ever restless at the club’s position.
