For 63 years Rex Coxeter had cherished his beloved pet Timmy the tortoise  – until thieves stole the endangered reptile from the family home.

The grandfather-of-seven, 73 - who has had the Hermann’s tortoise since he was an 11-year-old boy – came home from a short break to discover the treasured creature had been snatched, last month.

Retired mushroom grower Mr Coxeter has now launched an appeal for his safe return, warning Timmy could die without him - because no one else knows his ‘funny ways’.

Beloved: Rex Coxeter has pleaded for the return of family pet Timmy - stolen from his home in Dunmow, Essex, last month - who he had cherished since he was 10-year-old boy, left,

The stolen pet refuses to eat anything outside his strict diet of fresh grass and dandelions.

Mr Coxeter has
offered a considerable cash reward in a bid to be reunited with the 
reptile – thought to be Britain’s longest-serving family pet.

The
father-of-three said: ‘It is a nightmare to lose him after all these 
years. It is very sad. He will never survive with other people as they 
will not know his funny ways.

‘He is probably worth thousands of pounds - but it is not about the money.

‘I
want to know what happened to him. I am willing to pay a generous 
reward for any information leading to his rescue.

‘The thieves could not have known the tortoise was there - it was opportunistic.

‘My grandchildren are more upset about it than anyone else, because they’ve grown up with him all their lives.

‘To have had him for 63 years is pretty unique.

‘As
I look back, I just think my goodness - when I first had him there were
no motorways, all the railways were steam and the Queen wasn’t even on 
the throne.

‘It makes you realise just how old he is.’

It
is believed the endangered animal - which could be worth thousands of 
pounds - was snatched by opportunistic metal thieves as they scoured the
area for property to steal.

Neighbours
spotted a scrap metal truck, with white goods loaded in the back, 
pulling up at the family’s home in Dunmow, Essex, on April 23, just 
hours after the couple left for their weekend away.

Retired mushroom grower Rex also warned the thieves would struggle to sell the distinctive 10lbs (4.5kg) reptile because animal dealers will spot how rare it is.

The father-of-three said: ‘I knew he was gone as soon as I got back. He’s kept in a large area, and it’s like having a cow in a field – you instantly notice if they’ve gone missing.

Rex realised his precious tortoise was missing when he returned from holiday on May 2.

Neighbours spotted an open-sided scrap metal truck pulling up on his land between noon and 2pm and an intruder prowling around his back garden.

The police have been informed and Rex has also alerted the National Theft Register - an agency that helps find stolen exotic animals.

It is hoped the underside of Timmy’s shell, which is the equivalent of a human fingerprint and unique to each individual tortoise, will help police identify the pet.

John Hayward, from the national theft register, said there has been a recent spate of tortoise snatchings across the south east but believed Timmy’s theft was opportunistic.

He said: ‘The tortoise is extremely old and rare. It is on the most endangered list.

‘It is so sad. Those who have stolen it will not be providing for its welfare properly.

‘He is obviously sadly missed and the owners have offered a reward for its safe return and the police are anxious for any information leading to the arrest and conviction of the thieves.

‘Anybody who buys or sells these animals must have a licence or face criminal charges.’

Timmy, who came out of his six-month hibernation on March 24, needs a diet of dandelions, fresh grass and water to survive.

Hermann’s tortoises are found in the Mediterranean, from southern France to Turkey and in the Balkans and central Mediterranean islands.

They have a slightly hooked upper jaw and, like other tortoises, possess no teeth, just a strong, horny beak.

Until 1984, when the UK introduced an import ban, tortoises were regularly shipped from Mediterranean countries under cruel and cramped conditions.
