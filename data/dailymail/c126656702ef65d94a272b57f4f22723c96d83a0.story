Jimmy Bullard's larger than life character made him a popular hit among football fans up and down the country during his playing career. 

Since retiring the 36-year-old has released a book titled Bend it like Bullard, as the former Fulham midfielder tries to expand his horizons beyond football.

On Monday it was announced that Bullard will be entering this year's version of reality TV show I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! where his sense of humour is bound to prove a hit in the Australian jungle. 

Ahead of his trip down under, Sportsmail reviews Bullard's top 10 most memorable quotes.

Former Wigan, Fulham and Hull midfielder Jimmy Bullard will be on I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!

‘Jimmy White was my massive idol. I never met him until six weeks ago, when I found out he was at my local golf club and dashed up there. I didn’t really know how to approach him, it’s difficult. “Hello Jimmy, I’ve got hundreds of old VHS tapes of you back home. Bit perverted, I know, but that’s what I think of you”.’

‘The bloke was immaculate. His kit was tight and fitted him perfectly. Paolo di Canio became West Ham club captain and his skipper’s armband had claret and blue tassles hanging off it, making him look like a warrior.

'Socks rolled up perfectly over his permanently shaved, well-oiled legs, he oozed Italian class and style. He was a real man. And he was also an utterly terrifying nutcase.’

Bullard said his idol growing up was Jimmy White and he feared Paolo di Canio during his time at West Ham

‘[David] Bentley was also my partner in crime when it came to taking the p*** out of Mr Capello. I remember looking at the gaffer on my first day and thinking, ‘I can’t believe how much he looks like Postman Pat; it’s him!’ Bentley obviously loved it - ‘Wa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!’ - and when we were on the team coach, we sat at the back and started singing the Postman Pat theme tune. A few of the boys joined in - I think Rio, Ashley Cole and Jermaine Jenas might have had a quiet little sing-along -but most of the other dry lunches weren’t really up for it.’

‘My first training session with England…A bus took us to Arsenal’s training ground at London Colney. As it parked, Wayne Rooney was itching to get off. The door opened and he flew out of it like a dog let off its leash.

He legged it straight to one of the goals, picked a few balls out of the net and started shelling them at the crossbar, hitting it every time. ‘Wayne!’ screamed Fabio Capello. ‘You’ll pull a muscle!’ ‘Behave Fab, I’ve not pulled a muscle since I was 13,’ said Rooney. 

The pace of the training was at least twice as quick as I was used to at Fulham. We started with a five-vs-five keep-ball session in an area that seemed not much bigger than a tablecloth. The ball was still pinging about like a pinball as pass after pass was completed. After a drill like that, I couldn’t believe England get slagged off by pundits for not being able to pass the ball. Maybe our problem is we need to play internationals on pitches the size of tablecloths.’

‘I never felt Fabio gave the boys a lot of direction. For starters, his English was poor and it was very difficult to understand what he was going on about most of the time. The only thing he said that stuck was: “Let’s all attack together, let’s all defend together.” Not terrible advice, but when I remembered that this was international football, the pinnacle of the game, I thought it was just a little bit basic. To be frank, I’d had better coaching when I was playing non-League.’

Bullard was critical of Capello's grasp of the English language during their time together

‘The manager [Fabio Capello] didn’t make it easy, to be fair. We spent two weeks away with England and he said two sentences to me. He was terrible. It was really bad. I struggled with it. ‘You can’t have a laugh, you can’t have a drink; you eat when you’re told to. What’s all that about? Why can’t you eat when you’re hungry? I can’t stand it all. I’ve never understood it, but it’s professional and it’s the done thing. It’s boring.’

Bullard (left) also revealed that he wasn't a fan of  Capello strict management during his England reign

‘I came in one Monday morning at Fulham after we’d lost 3-0 and I was stretching and laughing with Danny Murphy, Paul Konchesky and a couple of others. Roy Hodgson’s come in and gone, “Stop laughing, we lost on Saturday”. Then his next team talk on Thursday is, “C’mon, let’s look forward to the next game”. Well, I can’t really, Roy, because you’ve just murdered me on Monday for laughing. A lot of managers do that. They say something and don’t really mean it. On Thursday it’s all right to have a laugh, is it? Monday too fresh? So, when’s the rule come in? When can I laugh? Tuesday night? Let me know. Breakfast time Wednesday? Is it longer depending on the score? I don’t understand it.’

‘I took fitness as a given and thought it wasn’t a skill, but it is. Fitness is a key. If we went on a long run, Nathan Ellington would run like he had a caravan on his back, but you wouldn’t beat him in a sprint. It’s mental. Razor (Neil Ruddock) was the unfittest player I ever saw and the most outrageous person I ever met. 

‘Doc, I’ve broke me arm in seven places… ‘Don’t go back to them seven places, then.’ 

A meeting [to discuss a new contract] was set up between me, my agent Andy Evans, Hodgson and the Fulham chief executive Alistair Mackintosh.

Andy and I met up with the chief exec, but there was no sign of Roy. Alistair was a bit confused by that and called him, only to find out he was playing golf and wouldn’t be coming. That was the end of that meeting.

I thought it was bang out of order. It doesn’t matter if you’re the chairman, owner or manager, you have to treat people with respect and that’s pretty much what I told Roy the next time I saw him.

I asked him where he’d been when we were supposed to have had a meeting and I told him it showed me and my agent a lack of respect. Perhaps I shouldn’t have been so hostile, but his decision not to attend that meeting spoke volumes.

Bullard played under Hodgson at Fulham between 2007 and 2009, helping the club avoid relegation in 2008
