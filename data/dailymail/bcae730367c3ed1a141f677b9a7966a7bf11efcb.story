A pet goldfish is recovering from an operation to remove a cancerous eye after its owner paid hundreds of pounds for the procedure.

Star the goldfish underwent the fiddly operation at Inglis Veterinary Hospital in Dunfermline, Fife, to remove one eye, which was cancerous and had left the fish blind.

The procedure was paid for by the Gordon family, who also shelled out for an operation to remove a lump from their other pet goldfish, Nemo.

The procedure was paid for by the Gordon family, who also shelled out for an operation to remove a lump from their other pet goldfish, Nemo. Both operations, carried out last Friday, cost the family nearly £500

The operations, which cost nearly £500, were carried out on the same day. 

Star, a six-inch goldfish, was welcomed into the Gordon family 12 years ago after being won at a local fair by Abby Gordon, now a 21-year-old student in Glasgow.

The pet fish live with her mother Janie in Dollar, Clackmannanshire.

Mrs Gordon said: 'I know it seems like a lot of money to spend on an operation for a goldfish but what was the alternative?

'I think we've a social responsibility to look after our pets and I know my daughter would have been distraught if anything had happened to the goldfish.

'Star is fine.He's swimming about happily and the vets have shown me how to give antibiotics too.

'I probably couldn't have chosen a better vets. I'm not sure anyone else would have attempted it.'

During the operation on Friday, the vets used Doppler ultrasound equipment to listen through earphones to pulse sounds in order to evaluate Star's blood flow.

To keep the fish asleep throughout the procedure, the pet was syringed with oxygenated water containing anaesthetic.

After the procedure, Star (right) was delicately held in a bucket of oxygenated water before being joined by the Gordon family's other goldfish, Nemo, who underwent an operation on the same day to remove a lump

After the procedure, Star was delicately held in a bucket of oxygenated water and, with its mouth kept open, was gently moved, mimicking the swimming action. 

This allowed water to flow over its gills for about for eight minutes, before the fish effectively came back to life.

The operation was carried out by exotic animals expert Brigitte Lord, who received help from a vet to keep the goldfish under anaesthetic and a nurse to monitor its heart rate.

Ms Lord said: 'This is a highly specialist field, using anaesthetic on a goldfish carries a very high risk and I'm delighted for the owner that everything went okay and the owners are happy.

'The financial value of a goldfish may be quite small but I think the fact that someone should have paid that much for an operation reflects the true value of the bond between pets and humans.'

Star and Nemo are now recovering from surgery in their tank, which is situated in the kitchen of Mrs Gordon's home.

Adam Tjolle, managing director of Inglis Veterinary Hospital, said: 'In all my years as a vet I have never known anything quite like this. It's been an amazing experience.'

Star and Nemo are not the first goldfish to undergo traumatic operations.

Earlier this year, Australian veterinarian Dr Tristan Rich - head of exotics and wildlife medicine at Lort Smith Animal Hospital in Melbourne - performed micro-surgery on a goldfish called George.

The 10-year-old pet had a large tumour on its head, making it difficult for the fish to breathe and swim. The amphibian was also unable to eat properly and the tumour was affecting its ability to see.

Its owners had been monitoring the growth of the tumour, which was sprouting from its head, and decided to opt for the surgery which cost $200 (£105).

During the 'fiddly' operation, the tumour - which had stretched down to the fish's skull - was delicately cut out.

In January, a devoted pet owner in Norfolk spent £300 on saving the life of his goldfish after it became constipated.

The man, who was not been named, took the fish to a veterinary practice in North Walsham, Norfolk, after noticing it was struggling to eliminate waste.

He had hoped it would be a simple procedure but was told by staff at the Toll Barn Veterinary Centre that the delicate surgery required to save his pet would cost £300.

The company boss initially turned down the treatment but changed his mind 10 minutes later and went back to give the go-ahead.

Vet Faye Bethell, 29, was then tasked with carefully administering anaesthetic before using tiny instruments to remove a lump close to the fish's backside.

A second lump was removed from his dorsal fin before the fish was returned to water and handed back to his grateful owner.
