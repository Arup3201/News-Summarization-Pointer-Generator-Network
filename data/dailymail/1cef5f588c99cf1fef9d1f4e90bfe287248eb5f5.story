As a male, skiing doesn’t usually rank too high on the list of activities you want to be doing in the nude.

Apart from the risk of snow burns on the tenderest part of the male anatomy, there’s a grave reality of shrinkage if you wear your birthday suit in the snow.

These concerns were not enough to discourage Australian skier Sam Ruttiman, who competed in an event called the Toyota One Hit Wonder this weekend at Thredbo donning nothing but his skis and a helmet.

Brave: Sam Ruttiman competed in the One Hit Wonder Event wearing nothing but his skis and a helmet

One Hit Wonder sees competitors attempting their best trick off a 30 metre jump at the back of Thredbo, eastern Australia. 

It’s a sport called free-skiing, which differs from conventional skiing in that it encourages creativity and personal expression. It's a mountingly popular international sport, with a number of professional skiiers starting to compete.

Despite his outrageously confident attire, Mr Ruttiman didn’t deliver the goods, wiping out on the first jump.

Mr Ruttiman was believed to have travelled much faster than usual,  losing control of his speed and landing off course

Northern Territory News reported that Ruttiman travelled much farther than usual without his clothes, in turn failing to control his his speed and landing where the jump started to flatten out.

Ruttiman suffered serious ice burns to his legs, but was reportedly spared from harming his manhood.

One of the judges for the event was Australian Olympian Anna Segal, who came fourth in the slopestyle event in the Sochi winter games.
