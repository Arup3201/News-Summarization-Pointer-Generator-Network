Smiles better: Thomas Muller posted this picture on his Facebook and Twitter accounts on Monday

Thomas Muller has recovered from a horror head injury and is ready to face the United States in Germany's final World Cup group clash.

The Bayern Munich striker ended Germany's 2-2 draw with Ghana on the turf following a nasty clash of heads with defender John Boye.

Muller, who scored a hat-trick in Germany's opening game match against Portugal, was left with blood pouring from the wound just above his right eye.Â 

But the striker has urged his fans 'not to worry' and says the Germans, among the favourites to win the tournament in Brazil, have targeted a place at the summit of Group G.

A draw in Saturday's match against the United States will be enough for Joachim Low's side to ensure top spot.

'Thanks for the many well wishes, Muller said accompanied with a picture of his face, on his Facebook count. 'All good with me, even if I look a little like a boxer.

'Do not worry, I'm well again. My cut was expertly sewn from Doc after playing with five stitches, so I already have a clear view, even if the eye is still a little green and blue.

'On Thursday we enjoy a tough match against the USA. But what is clear: We want to be first in the group! And with your support we will make it!'
