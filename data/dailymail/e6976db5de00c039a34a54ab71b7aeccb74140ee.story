It may be home to rats and grime but a creative photographer has turned New York's subway system into his own fashion studio.

Aaron Pegg, 29, who goes by his middle name Clifton, has captured beautiful models posing in one of the country's more unusual spots.

From eating pizza to flashing Calvin Klein underwear, the girls make the bizarre backdrop their own by showing off the stunning clothes.

Clifton, who has more than 100,000 followers on his Instagram account 'underground-nyc', began taking the photographs in 2013.

And since then the innovative photographer has amassed a huge following online with his arty shots - which include other mass transit systems such as Chicago.

Scientists from Weill Cornell Medical College in Manhattan spent 18 months swabbing turnstiles, ticket kiosks, railings and benches for DNA.

The boffins also found 15,152 different types of microorganisms sharing the trains with riders including the bubonic plague, dysentery and meningitis.

However, New York's subway system, which carries 5.5 million passengers a week, continues to be a source of incredible artistry for Clifton.

The New Yorker said: 'I was shooting the typical city stuff such as rooftop views, buildings, cabs and bridges until one day I almost got arrested for roof topping.

'It was too much of a close call and it was getting too cold to continue to get these views so I asked myself what can I shoot in any weather and have access to all the time?

'This led me to the subway but I couldn't just capture it on a typical day - it had to be different so I decided to capture the stations empty.

'Photography has always been a hobby and a way for me to creatively express myself but now it is turning into a business.

'I take magazine commissions and anything business related which there is a budget for.'

Clifton admits he often gets unusual reactions from fellow subway riders who happen to walk in on his shoots.

He added: 'I get everything from guys smiling and wanting to talk to the models to people shocked and not understanding what is going on.'

Aaron Pegg, who goes by the name of Clifton, has even been snapping the models with food on the subway system
