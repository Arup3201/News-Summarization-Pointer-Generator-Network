A married couple have been found dead at home just hours after their 13-year-old son left for school.

Jonathan and Derisa Trenchard were discovered yesterday at their bungalow in Carbis Bay, near St Ives in Cornwall, after they both failed to turn up to work.

Police have launched an investigation into the deaths, but say they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the inquiry.

The couple's cause of death has not been revealed pending a post-mortem examination due to take place today.

Tragic: Jonathan and Derisa Trenchard were found dead at their home yesterday morning

Couple: The pair failed to turn up to work, prompting their colleagues to alert the police

Neighbours saw the Trenchards' 
13-year-old son Joel leave for school on Wednesday morning, and the pair
were seen walking their King Charles spaniels around 8.45am.

However,
Mr Trenchard, 50, failed to show up for work at a local factory, and 
Mrs Trenchard, 48, did not go to the office where she worked as a legal 
secretary.

Their colleagues raised the alarm, and when police visited their home around 11.30am they found them both dead.

Two
officers were this morning guarding the small semi-detached 
grey-bricked bungalow on a small cul-de-sac within the street, which is 
predominantly inhabited by retirees.

The couple are thought to have two other sons apart from Joel - 26-year-old Christopher and Joshua, 23.

Town: The Trenchards lived in Carbis Bay, a seaside community with a high proportion of retirees

Bungalow: Jonathan and Derisa Trenchard were found dead at their home in Carbis Bay, Cornwall

Investigation: Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the couple's death

Jennifer Isaacs, 34, who has lived opposite the family for five years, said they were a 'kind, lovely' couple with three children.

'They were really lovely people,' she said. 'I've lived by them for the past five years and I used to see them everyday walking their dogs on my way to work. They had three King Charles which they doted on.

'The neighbourhood is in total shock as this is normally such a quiet area. We're desperate to piece together exactly what's happened as no one knows at the moment.

'Their youngest son went to school as normal and I've heard that the alarm was raised when John didn't go into work.'

Another neighbour, June Whelehan, 61, said: 'I'm in total shock. All the neighbours are trying to work out what may have happened as they were no signs whatsoever and they seemed to live a very pleasant life.

'They were a very nice couple. John used to work really long hours in work - he was a very hard worker.

'He was also very kind to the older neighbours, as it's quite an elderly area, and he would often help us with our gardens and paths when it snowed.'

Alice Liversedge, 42, added: 'They were always very pleasant and would send everyone on the road cards at Christmas time. They seemed to live a very nice life and they were both pretty hard working. It's really tragic.'

South Western Ambulance service confirmed they were called to the property just before 1pm on Wednesday but did not comment further.

A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said: 'At 11.33am on Wednesday St Ives police attended Polwithen Drive, St Ives following a report of concern for the occupants.

'Enquires at the address led to the discovery of a body of a man and a woman. Enquires are ongoing. At this time police are not looking for anyone else in relation to this enquiry.'
