Anchor butter, once as much a part of New Zealand as the All Blacks rugby team, is now made in Britain.

Owner of the brand, Arla, has moved production of the dairy product to Westbury in Wiltshire, breaking a tradition which lasted over 120 years and returning the butter to its English roots.

The original recipe was created in 1886 by Harry Reynolds, a Cornish dairyman who had emigrated to the other side of the world.

The inspiration for the famous red anchor logo was supposedly a tattoo on one of his worker’s arms.

Imports to the UK began in 1924, ending in 2012 when Arla – a  co-operative owned by British farmers – began making it in England using British cream.

The move did not go down well with fans of the original, who felt the product changed significantly as a result, becoming lighter in colour with a creamier texture.

However, despite the objections, the company revealed last week that annual sales across all its products rose 22 per cent in 2013, reaching £2.2billion.

Following a merger last year, Arla is now the largest dairy company in the country, making over 4,000 deliveries a day to shops and distribution centres across the country.

Anchor butter is still also made in New Zealand by the Fonterra company, who use the same recipe developed in 1886.

From April 2014, the business will supply 30,000 tonnes of cheddar to its retail customer Asda, increasing cheese production by 50 per cent.

It also signed an exclusive partnership with Starbucks to supply 30 million litres of Cravendale to all its 700 stores in the UK and Northern Ireland on an annual basis.
