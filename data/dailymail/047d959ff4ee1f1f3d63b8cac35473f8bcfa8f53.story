Dimitri Mascarenhas has been appointed bowling coach by New Zealand.

The former England all-rounder replaces Shane Bond who will leave the role after the current World Cup.

The 37-year-old, who played 20 one-day internationals, is currently coaching New Zealand's Otago province and previously coached in the English county championship, the Indian Premier League and Australia's Big Bash League.

Mascarenhas said Bond 'has done an extremely good job with his bowling unit; they have operated with real pace, skill and tactical awareness. 

'During this World Cup they have been phenomenal and I am looking forward to working with those guys to keep developing them and helping them achieve success on the international stage.'

Mascharenhas's most famous moment in an England shirt came when he blasted five sixes in succession off the final five balls of England's innings against India at The Oval in September 2007. Yuvraj Singh was the embarrassed bowler.
