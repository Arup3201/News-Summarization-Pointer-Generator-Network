Forget cash, cheques or credit cards, one cafe has a different way of charging its customers for a cup of coffee.

Metro St. James, a French style cafe in Sydney, is running a unique and romantic promotion this month.

Between the hours of 9 and 11am, the cafe is letting customers pay their bill by giving each other a kiss.

Pucker up! A cafe in Sydney is running a promotion this month where couples can kiss for a free coffee

Cute or creepy? The somewhat cringey promotional video shows couples locking lips for a free coffee

'We’re bringing romance back! Take 
your partner to the cafe from 9-11am in June and surprise them with a 
kiss when you order your coffee.

'We’re not accepting your money, just your kisses,' reads a post on Metro St James' Facebook page. 

While some may find this concept somewhat creepy, the French-themed shop, which opened its doors three months ago, has included a video featuring several couples 
earning their cups of coffee by way of their lips.

'We'll watch you. It has to be a real kiss, I can see if it's a fake kiss,' the proprietor says in the video as he hands over the coffees.

Romantic? The cafe claim that their concept is bringing romance back

He adds that if they try to fake a kiss, he'll know because he's 'kind of a specialist.'

More than one Facebook user on the social media site has asked whether customers could arrive alone and just make out with the staff, with one writing: 'Can you just turn up alone and kiss that cute waiter with the french accent instead?'.

The world's longest kiss lasted 58 hours, 35 minutes and 58 seconds.

It was achieved by Ekkachai Tiranarat and Laksana Tiranarat from Thailand.

It happened at an event organised by Ripley's Believe It or Not! Pattaya, in Pattaya, Thailand, on 12-14 February 2013.

Nine couples entered the annual competition.

One of the couple were in their 70s.

The winners took home a cash prize and two diamond rings as well as a Guinness World records title.
