The Mojito, a Cuban mix of white rum, sugar, lime, mint and soda water, is the most popular cocktail in Britain according to a report

Sales of cocktails have risen by more than 10 per cent in the past two years.

More than one in five of Britain's pubs and bars now serve cocktails and the Mojito – a Cuban mix of white rum, sugar, lime, mint and soda water – is the most popular, according to a report.

Pina Coladas (rum, coconut and pineapple juice) and Woo Woos (vodka, peach schnapps and cranberry juice) were also popular.

The Mixed Drinks Report, by consultancy firm CGA Strategy, found more women than men choose cocktails, as 54 per cent of cocktail drinkers are female.

Bomb and pitcher serves remain popular, with 74 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds admitting to have bought a bomb drink, while nine in 10 in the same age range say they drink pitchers. 

Cocktails are enjoyed by the core 18 to 35-year-old demographic 'in all on-trade occasions' including throughout the night, as opposed to just the start. 

Tom Lynch, of CGA, said: 'Cocktails and the bars and pubs that serve them have been surging in popularity over the last few years and our latest research emphasises just how integrated they've become to mainstream drinking,'

'They present a terrific opportunity for bars and pubs to drive footfall and increase spend - but only if they can fully understand what customers want from a cocktail menu and give them a consistent experience every time.' 

The research also finds that following the Mojito, sales of the Pina Colada, Woo Woo and Sex on the Beach have also grown as increasingly more mainstream venues move into cocktails.

Havana is the birthplace of the Mojito, although the exact origin of this classic cocktail is the subject of debate.

Some historians argue that African slaves who worked in the Cuban sugar cane fields during the 19th century were instrumental in the cocktail's origin.
