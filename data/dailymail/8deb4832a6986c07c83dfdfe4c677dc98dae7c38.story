Weeks to live: Kirstie Tancock was told she was close to death for the second time in two years when her body rejected her first transplant

A 23-year-old pole dancing instructor with cystic fibrosis has today had her second double lung transplant in just two years.

Kirstie Tancock was told she had weeks to live without a new transplant, after her body rejected the first pair.

Doctors warned Mrs Tancock that the chances of finding a suitable donor for a second time were slim, but miraculously found a donor within hours.

The transplant team said chances of success were blighted by Mrs Tancock's high levels of antibodies, which suggest that a transplant could be rejected.

Mrs Tancock, who became the face of organ donation in the Devon area in a Lifesavers campaign, was sedated today following the successful operation.

Her husband Stuart thanked the doctors who had worked on the transplant and said the operation, 'went well'.

Before the transplant Mrs Tancock said: 'I have the delight in telling you all that I'm going down to surgery for my second double lung transplant.

'I've
kept that secret all night! I'm thinking about my donor and their 
family, the ones who allowed me these amazing two years and the ones who
are allowing me this next chance.

'Thankyou all everyone for your love and support. I love you all x'.

The pole dancing instructor returned to work just six months after her last transplant and took up the activity in 2007 in order to improve her fitness and stay active.

Resilient: The 23-year-old bounced back from her surgery in 2011 and was able to exercise on a pole just six months after her operation

The 23-year-old was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis at birth.

It is and inherited disease which affects over 8,500 children and young adults in the UK.

Five babies are born with the 
condition every week. It is caused by a faulty gene that allows too much
salt and not enough water into cells.

This results in a build-up of sticky 
mucus in the bodyâ€™s passageways that damages the lungs and digestive system, resulting in inflammation and repeated
infections.

There is no cure for the condition, but many treatments and therapies can make it easier to live with.

It is only in severe cases, when the lungs stop working properly, that a lung transplant may be recommended.

Fighter: Before her surgery in 2011, Kirstie Tancock went through with her wedding despite being in a wheelchair. This weekend she thanked her donors for their gift of life

Severe condition: Transplants are only recommended when the lungs stop working properly. Cystic fibrosis causes a build-up of sticky mucus in the body's passageways that can make breathing difficult
