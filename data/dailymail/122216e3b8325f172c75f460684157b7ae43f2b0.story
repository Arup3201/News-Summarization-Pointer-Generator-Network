The NYPD has replaced a deputy commissioner who proposed that his officers should be supplied with breath mints to prevent them from swearing and that protesters should be sprayed with baby oil so they could easier to remove. 

Michael Julian was appointed to the post by police chief Bill Bratton to reform the department following the controversial chokehold death of Staten Island man Eric Garner.

He lasted just two months in the post before the decision was made to transfer him to a less controversial position.

A source told the New York Post: 'He would come up with these wacky ideas. We would roll our eyes and move on.'

Julian ordered 10,000 individually wrapped breath mints which were delivered to the NYPD headquarters building. 

The mints were due to be deployed to individual officers, who would then be instructed to unpeel the wrapper if they felt the urge to swear. 

Julian believed that by the time the officer had unwrapped the mint and placed it into his mouth, he would no longer want to curse.

Earlier he had suggested that police should deploy baby oil in situations when protesters link arms and sit down. 

He claimed that the baby oil would prevent the protesters from hanging onto each other and officers with rubber gloves could remove them easily. 

It is understood that Julian was removed from his position as deputy commissioner for training following the gaffes and transferred to the personnel department. 

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered a review into training within the New York Police Department following the death of father-of-six Eric Garner. 

Mr Garner died after an NYPD officer placed him in a chokehold during an attempted arrest on Staten Island on July 17, 2014. 

Officers arrested Mr Garner, who they suspected of selling untaxed cigarettes illegally.
