Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny has no future at Arsenal and should move on for the sake of his international career, according to former Liverpool stopper Jerzy Dudek.

The former Anfield man, a fellow countryman of Szczesny, believes that Arsene Wenger will always choose David Ospina and the Polish keeper should move on to improve his chances of playing for his country.

'It's a serious matter,' Dudek told Poland's TVP Sport. 'Fortunately, we have two other goalkeepers who are able to provide an adequate level in our goal.

'In excellent form is Lukasz Fabianski and, on the other hand, Artur Boruc is very experienced. I think [Adam] Nawalka [Poland manager] will wait to make the decision until the very end.

'Wojciech is the least likely to play in the match with Ireland. If I were in his place, I would wonder whether there are still opportunities to arise at Arsenal and wouldn't wait as long as Fabianski, because you can see that Arsene Wenger is firmly set on David Ospina.'

Fabianski (Swansea) and Boruc (on loan at Bournemouth from Southampton) are both goalkeepers with Premier League experience and, perhaps more importantly, regular first-team game-time this season.

Ospina has impressed since taking the reigns from Szczesny after the Southampton game on January 1

Szczesny started the season as Arsenal's No 1, but was dropped after being caught smoking in the showers at Southampton on New Year's Day. Since then, he has made just three appearances for the Gunners, all of which in the FA Cup.

Premier League goalkeeping duties have been placed in the hands, quite literally, of Colombian Ospina, who has made 13 appearances for Wenger's side since the turn of the year.
