The granddaughter of the late Labour firebrand Tony Benn is on course to become the first generation of her family to be elected to public office.

Emily Benn, 24, is expected to become a Labour councillor this week, continuing a political dynasty dating back more than 100 years.

She hopes that winning in the London Borough of Croydon will build on the legacy of her uncle, grandfather, great-grandfather and great-great-grandfather who have all been MPs.

Emily Benn, who has been a member of the Labour party since the age of 14, hopes to be elected as a councillor on Thursday

Family: Uncle Hilary Benn, grandfather Tony Benn and great-grandfather 
William Wedgwood Benn and great-great-grandfather Sir John Williams Benn
 were all elected as MPs

Local elections are being held across the country on Thursday, the same day as elections to the European Parliament.

Miss Benn is
 standing in the safe Labour ward of West Thornton in Croydon, and 
is almost certain to win. It would mark the latest chapter in her 
family’s long political history.

Her
 uncle, Hilary Benn, was Environment Secretary in the last Labour 
government and sits in Ed Miliband’s shadow cabinet with the local 
government brief.

Grandfather
 Tony Benn, who died in March, was first elected as an MP in 1950 and 
stood down in 2001, serving in Harold Wilson’s Cabinet and stood 
unsuccessfully to become Labour’s deputy leader in 1981.

Miss
 Benn told the Mirror: ‘I find it very strange he's not here and it's a 
huge regret that he did not live a few months longer. He would have loved to see me elected…If I'm elected.’

Great-grandfather William Wedgwood Benn was elected as a Liberal MP in 1906, serving in the Asquith government, before he quit in 1927 to join the Labour party, later sitting in the Cabinet of Ramsay Macdonald.

Her great-great-grandfather, Sir John Williams Benn, was a Liberal MP from 1892-95 and again from 1904-10.

Another great-great-grandfather, Daniel Homes, was a Labour MP from 1911-18.

Miss Benn herself stood for Parliament in 2010, in the safe Tory seat of East Worthing and Shoreham.

‘Sadly I could not persuade the electorate of East Worthing and Shoreham to break their habit of a lifetime,’ she added.

Far from being a hard-left firebrand, she works in a City bank and describes herself as being New Labour.

She added: ‘Parties have to talk about the issues that are central to people's lives, about things like the challenge of finding of a job.

‘All I have to do is talk about how much it costs to live in London, and suddenly you get a wave of stuff and they are interested in politics. I want to buy a house one day and that's not going to happen.

‘There's no point saying this is the Labour Party and this is what we think. We must ask people what they think and take up their issues. Politics isn't about me. It's about their lives. I want to change people's lives for the better.’

If, as many expect, she does make it to Parliament, she will join a long list of MPs with politics in their blood.

One in 12 MPs is related to another politician in dynasties dating back 140 years.

It includes six married couples who sit alongside each other on the famous green leather benches, 21 MPs whose parents served in the Commons and three pairs of siblings.

Among them are David Cameron's great-grandfather Sir William Mount, a Tory MP from 1900-06 and again from 1910-22, Ed Miliband's broth David who quit the Commons after losing out on the Labour leadership and married couples Ed Balls and Yvette Cooper, Duncan Hames and Jo Swinson, and Harriet Harman and Jack Dromey.
