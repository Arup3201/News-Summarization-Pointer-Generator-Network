The front-page consisted of 1,000 Russian planes raiding towns in Finland, two royal birthdays and prisoners locking their own guards in cells.

Also in the first Boxing Day edition of the Daily Mail in the Second World War was a story about a father accidentally running over his own daughter.

And the newspaper on December 26, 1939 carried a feature on George VI's Christmas broadcast to millions of listeners from Sandringham in Norfolk.

Plane raids and Christmas messages: The Daily Mail's front page on the first Boxing Day during the Second World War, in 1939

He said of the approaching New Year: ‘If it brings peace, how thankful we shall all be. If it brings us continued struggle we shall remain undaunted.’

The King’s comments came ahead of a Russian raid on Finland, with two attacks on Helsinki and a 'large number of casualties' reported.

There was also a report in the newspaper - which cost one penny - of both sides in the war declaring a voluntary and unofficial 'armistice' for Christmas.

The article went on to say: 'Turkey and plum pludding were enjoyed by our troops, in ships at sea and in Air Force messes'

In the news: Three of the front-page stories were a driver running over his daughter, a prison riot in Northern Ireland and the King's broadcast

Elsewhere, a driver named John Townsley, of Coldstream in the Scottish Borders, was tragically said to have run over his 19-year-old daughter Helen.

A report stated that he was 'motoring home with his wife and friends after a dance when he felt his car hit something', before finding it was his daughter.

The family had organised the dance for soldiers in the town, and Miss Townsley had been walking along a lane while seeing a friend home in the dark.

Meanwhile a jail riot was reported at Londonderry Prison in Northern Ireland, with inmates setting fire to bedding and smashing furniture.

Break in fighting: Other articles in the newspaper included a piece on Christmas for troops on the Western Front (left), and two royal birthdays

A report said prisoners 'overpowered five warders, locked them in cells, barricaded a door, and maintained a siege' in a part of the jail.

But they eventually surrendered after armed police arrived, plumbers burned through the doors and firemen turned a hose on the prisoners.

One of the photographs on the Mail's front-page was of the Duchess of Gloucester celebrating her 38th birthday on Christmas Day.

Also pictured was Princess Alexandra, daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Kent, who celebrated her third birthday on the same day.
