A day at the beach making sandcastles is no longer just child’s play.

Sandsculptors have travelled from all over the world, determined to make their mark in the sand at the 2012 North American Sandsculpting Championship which started this week.

They have 24 hours over three days to transform mountains of sand into amazing creations at Virginia Beach, Virginia.

Sand sensation: Bagrat Stepanian puts some last minute touches on a sand sculpture created along with Pavel Mylnikov from Russia, for the 2012 North American Sandsculpting Championship

Even the sand, all 450 tonnes of it, is imported to the beach from Currituck County, North Carolina in the annual competition with $55,000 up for grabs, the largest amount of prize money for sandsculpting in America.

The sculptors have been working tirelessly under a football field-sized tent, to ensure their work survives the wind and rain during the 10-day Neptune Festival, of which the competition is a part.

Sculptor Benjamin Probanza from Mexico said: ‘It feels like a gallery – more professional’ according to HamptonRoads.com.

Under the tent there was 22 sand sculptures created by 12 solo artists and 10 doubles who have come from Singapore, the Netherlands, Ireland, Portugal, Russia, Italy and Canada and many other countries.

The sculptors, competing by invitation only, use all kinds of tools to mould the sand, from trowels to feather dusters but are limited on materials. They can use only sand, water and ‘finishing spray’ which is watered-down wood glue. No supports, foreign objects or other accessories.

One team, Wilfred Stijger and Edith van de Wetering from Holland, met at a sandsculpting competition 15 years ago.

Mr Stijger said: ‘It's performance art, not meant to last. 

‘You can forgive mistakes in sand that you could not forgive in stone. Besides, there are girls in bikinis down here.’

Sue McGrew, an artist from Seattle, watched her 9ft sand sculpture collapse late on Wednesday.

She said: ‘I was hollowing out the back, and I pushed it beyond its limits. 

‘It happens. It's sand.’
