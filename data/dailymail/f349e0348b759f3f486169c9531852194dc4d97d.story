The Humane Society of Missouri is offering $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the person who viciously burned a pit bull last month, resulting in the dog's death.

The pooch named Zeus was discovered August 27 with horrific third-degree burns to 75 per cent of his head and 30 per cent of his body in St Louis.

His left front paw was scorched to the degree that there was no padding left.

Heartbreaking crime: A 3-year-old pit bull named Zeus was brought to a veterinary clinic last month with horrific burns to most of his body

WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT The pooch had nearly his entire face scorched, and also suffered burns to his left side and scrotum; his left front paw (right) was left with nearly no padding

The 3-year-old pet's injuries were so severe and his suffering so great that veterinarians were forced to euthanize him.

Initially, the Humane Society put up a $2,500 reward to help catch the culprit behind the animal abuse. The reward now has been doubled to $5,000, according to the station KSDK. 

‘We believe there are people who know what happened to Zeus,’ said Mike Perkins, director, Humane Society of Missouri Animal Cruelty Task Force.

Tragic outcome: The extent of Zeus' injuries was such that he had to be euthanized to spare him further suffering

Beloved pet: Zeus was adopted as a puppy by a St Louis man who entrusted him with a friend last month while he was moving to another place

Zeus belonged to a man identified on a Facebook page dedicated to the pet as Benjamin, who adopted him as a puppy from a serviceman stationed in Alaska.

Last month, the owner was in the process of moving to another home and asked a friend to look after his pet.

But on August 26, the 3-year-old pup vanished from the yard of the residence in north St Louis where he had been staying.

Zeus' caretaker called the Humane Society to report the pooch missing, The St Louis Post-Dispatch reported.

The next day, he received a call from a neighbor who found Zeus severely burned in his yard near the intersection of Amelia Avenue and Bircher Boulevard.

The beloved pit bull suffered gruesome injuries to his head, left hip, left leg and scrotum after someone had doused him with gasoline and set him alight.

Zeus was rushed to a veterinarian, but the animal could not be saved. The 3-year-old pet had to be put down to spare him further suffering. 

The medic who treated Zeus and eventually euthanized him said that prior to the tragedy, the pooch appeared to be in good health.
