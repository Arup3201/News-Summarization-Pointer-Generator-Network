Two very different photographs have emerged of the Cleveland Browns quarterback from his Independence Day weekend away in Las Vegas that appear to show the former Heisman Trophy winner in compromising situations.

One picture shows everyone's favorite NFL bad boy in an amorous clinch with Playboy model Dallas Nicole while the other shows the Browns draft pick rolling a $20 bill in the bathroom, leaving many wondering just what for?

What is going on here? Johnny Manziel is pictured in a Las Vegas club bathroom rolling a $20 note

Indeed, having embarked on what seems like a non-stop party since Cleveland picked him up in May's draft, the 21-year-old has been living it up like a rock star.

Like a man on a mission, Manziel has spent the past two months seemingly never far from a pool and never far from a pretty girl and this weekend was no different when he was photographed with Playboy model Dallas Nicole.

Just like the picture of Manziel in the bathroom with the rolled bank note leaked to Busted Coverage, the pictures of Manziel and Dallas have set tongues wagging, wondering if Manziel has worked more of his NFL magic as he tears through post-season.

Indeed, whether it is at Justin Bieber's Los Angeles party or playing a simple bartender in Austin, Manziel seems to mix up his partying.

However, the rookie has publicly said he is tiring of all the attention of how he spends his free time and has declared that he will not change his lifestyle for anyone.

This has led some to wonder whether Manziel is trolling all of his hawk-eyed critics with the suggestive money rolling picture, because surely he would not dare be caught out and jeopardise his $8.25 million four-year contract?

The player himself has said how aware he is of being followed round clubs by eager members of the public trying to record him engaging in unruly behavior.

'Now more than ever I've seen that it's an every-weekend thing wherever I'm at â€” whether it's in Cleveland on a weekend, or in Dallas or anywhere on a weekend, people want to record what I'm doing because they think it's a story.'

The Cleveland Browns who recently asked Manziel to cool his wild partying have decline to comment on the picture which after all only shows a man rolling a note with no illegal activities pictured or drugs seen.

Regardless, Manziel and Dallas were both pictured cozying up together - the two Texans looking very close as they enjoyed their July 4.

Describing herself in her Facebook bio as a Playboy Model and bikini competitor, Dallas will surely set the internet on fire in the same way as it did when Manziel was spotted at a Rangers game with aspiring Maxim model Kyndal Kyaire in April.
