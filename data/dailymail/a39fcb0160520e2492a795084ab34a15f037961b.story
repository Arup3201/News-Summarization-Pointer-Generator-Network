Two Texas men have been arrested on animal cruelty charges after allegedly mutilating a horse so badly that she later died from wounds to her genitals and anus. 

Arturo Aleman, 63, and Erasmo Nunez, 55, reportedly tied up the  mare, named Yanaha, and cut off her genitals, before leaving her for dead in a field they owned near Gregory in San Patricio County.

The five-year-old horse was rescued by Rockport Horse Rescue, which rushed her to veterinary hospital, where she underwent surgery to allow her to urinate and defecate.

Victim: The duo reportedly tied up the mare (pictured after the alleged mutilation and shortly before her death), named Yanaha, and cut off her genitals, before leaving her for dead in a field they owned near Gregory, Texas

Rescue workers also  spent six hours each day cleaning Yanaha - who was unable to lie down - and helping her evacuate feces. But despite their best efforts, the mare died several weeks later.

Now, Aleman and Nunez have been booked into San Patricio County Jail on charges of cruelty to a livestock animal, a Class A misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in prison.

Following the alleged mutilation in August, the suspects told investigators the mare had become caught in a fence, causing her genitals to be ripped out, attorney Mike Welborn told KZTV.

However, Michelle Hird, owner of Rockport Horse Rescue, who looked after Yanaha before she died, said the horse had been deliberately cut 'from her anus to down in between her legs'.

Horrifically, she added that one of mare's largest wounds 'was the size of a football', while she also suffered numerous injuries to her legs from being 'tied up and mutilated'.

'Her wounds were worse than I could have imagined.  All of her exterior genital parts were simply gone,' she wrote on the rescue center's Facebook page. 

'She had some leg injuries, some of which we believe were from laying out in the field for weeks without treatment and others which we believe were from tying her up in order to mutilate her.'

Describing Yanaha's final days, Mrs Hird told KZTV: 'Watching her fight so hard to survive was hard. She was not a quitter. She wanted to live and she fought and fought.'

Tragic: Aleman and Nunez were arrested after a grand jury found enough evidence to charge them with animal cruelty on November 13. The have both posted bond. Above, Yanaha is pictured shortly before her death

Despite Yanaha's fighting spirit, the mare passed away on October 11.

Aleman and Nunez were arrested after a grand jury found enough evidence to charge them with animal cruelty on November 13. 

Alemam faces two counts and has posted a $10,000 bond.

Nunez faces one and has posted a $1,500 bond.
