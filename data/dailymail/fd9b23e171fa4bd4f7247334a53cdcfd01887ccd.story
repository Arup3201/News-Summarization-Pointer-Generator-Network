Neymar may have missed his Brazil side's hapless exit from their home World Cup, but he's wasted no time in raising the stakes.

The Barcelona star posted one of his trademark selfies on his Instagram account of him and his friends playing poker.

Neymar was ruled out of his country's final two matches after injuring his back in the quarter-final against Colombia.

His side went on to be humiliated 7-1 against eventual champions Germany before limping to a 3-0 defeat in the third-place play-off against Holland.

Neymar will link up with new striker Luis Suarez at Barcelona, with the Spanish media reporting that he'll form a partnership with the Uruguayan, with talisman Lionel Messi playing in the hole.

The talented Brazilian faces up to another month on the sidelines, which in reality isn't too bad considering the fact he could have been paralysed if he had been hit in the back one inch higher.

The Catalan giants will be hoping Neymar can produce the kind of clinical streak he showed during the World Cup before his injury, as he became Brazil's sixth all-time top goalscorer overtaking Ronaldinho in the process.

After netting 17 times in 42 appearances last term as Barcelona endured a trophy-less season, the young Brazilian and his team will most certainly be looking to raise the stakes in La Liga this time around.
