From glossy lilypads to rings that resemble roses, the work of jeweller Lydia Courteille owes as much to nature as it does to the work table.

Crafted from vintage rubies, pink sapphires, tsavorites, brown diamonds and tourmalines, the pieces are part of a stunning new collection of gems on display at CoutureLab in Belgravia.

Also included in the exhibition are pieces by Bangkok's Lotus Arts de Vivre which takes the nature theme one step further by including tropical wood and horn in their pieces.

Among the most striking are a pair of black bear paw cufflinks by Lotus Arts de Vivre and a spectacular pink orchid-inspired ring by Courteille.

'I have known both Lydia Courteille and Rolf van Bueren [of Lotus Arts de Vivre] personally for a very long time and have collected their pieces over the years,' explains Carmen Busquets, the owner and founder of CoutureLab.

'Lydia I met in Paris, and I have bought amazing vintage and bespoke pieces from her. Rolf and his family I met in Bali, I always have loved their attention to detail and the way they have put Asian culture on the international map.'

She continued: 'The jewellery covers different cultures. The craftsmanship is exquisite. Lydia Courteille and Lotus Arts de Vivre are truly unique.

Bright green and similar to an emerald at first glance, the tsavorite is actually part of the garnet family.

A relatively recent discovery, the first specimens were unearthed in Tanzania in 1967 by gemologist, Dr Campbell R. Bridges.

The remained relatively unknown until 1974 when a marketing campaign by Tiffany & Co brought it to prominence.

It finally got a moniker the same year when Tiffany president Sir Henry Platt suggested naming it after Tsavo National Park in neighbouring Kenya.

'Weâ€™re excited to have the exhibition 
housed at CoutureLab because the unique luxury pieces 
transcend beyond seasons and trends, which is such a core part of our 
philosophy.'

Half of the stunning jewels, all of which are crafted by hand, are the work of Rolf and Helen von Bueren who founded Lotus 
Arts de Vivre three decades ago.

But while the von Buerens take their inspiration from the tropical environment of the Far East and focus on oriental snakes and mythological dragons, Courteille's brand of flora and fauna hails from Europe.

A certified gemologist, Courteille travels the world in search of ancient stones, including some that date from the 18th century, to incorporate into her delicate pansies and roses.

Works by Lydia Courteille and Lotus Arts de Vivre can be seen at CoutureLab in Belgravia until 31st December
