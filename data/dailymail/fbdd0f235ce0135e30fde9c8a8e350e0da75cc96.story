At 51, Shermaine Miles likes going to jail.

And she ought to by now - considering she's just been arrested for the 397th time.

Other reports put the figure as high as 446 arrests.

A hated figure on the streets of Chicago's North Side, harassing passers-by and terrorizing the community, Miles has been described as 'a master at working the system'.

She fakes seizures that mean costly hospital visits, only to convince judges to delay her case and return to the streets, where she is arrested again and again, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

She knows most officers by name and is ranked in in the top 1 percent for all current CPD arrestees.

You look familiar: Shermaine Miles was arrested Wednesday for the 379th time for allegedly stealing a set of keys from a man in Chicago's North Side. She had been out of jail for just one month

Among her many charges are prostitution, retail theft, criminal damage to property, armed robbery, misdemeanor battery, reckless conduct and drinking in public.

She has been convicted and sent to prison at least 10 times, records show.

Miles' latest arrest, on Wednesday, come just one month after a stint in jail.

'It's sad,' said Ald. James Cappleman, who once feared for his life after Miles chased him with a knife.

'She really needs a structured environment to give us all, including herself, some peace.

'The real story is that we have someone who is terrorizing our community and we can’t stop it.

'This has gone on for years and years with her.

'My goal is that we do something so that she stops falling through the cracks.'

After her release from Logan Correctional Center in Downstate Lincoln November 18, Miles headed to Humboldt Park to a second-chance residential home for ex-inmates.

At the time, Miles — whose arrests have mostly occurred on the North Side — said she planned to quit drinking for good and stay away from her drinking buddies on the North Side.

She said she was done with her life petty crime.

But the Edgewater business community — which dreaded Miles’ return — began seeing her in her old haunts earlier this month.

Miles was arrested Wednesday after allegedly being identified as the woman who approached a 63-year-old man in the 5600 block of North Winthrop and stole a set of keys from him, police said.

Miles was found nearby, drinking and 'engaging in a physical altercation with a male companion', police said.
