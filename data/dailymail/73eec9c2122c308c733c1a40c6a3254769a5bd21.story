So for the first time, Jermain Defoe failed to score on his debut for a new club, and was spared that modern dilemma of whether or not to celebrate scoring against an old one.

He had hoped to notch Premier League goal No 124 just over a year after his last, against Crystal Palace last January, but will continue his quest against Burnley at the Stadium of Light on January 31.

That might be an easier task than breaching an improving Tottenham back line while starved of service, which was his task at White Hart Lane. After debut goals for West Ham, Bournemouth, Tottenham, Portsmouth and Toronto, a sixth was never on the cards.

The former England forward did not manage a shot at goal, even though he could claim to have made Sunderland's goal, being fouled for the free kick from which Sebastian Larsson equalised.

But he had no chances worthy of the name to improve on a not-particularly-impressive recent record of three goals in 34 Premier League games. That said, he had prospered against less fearsome opposition over the same period, scoring twice for England against San Marino, seven times in the Europa League against such mighty opponents as FC Sheriff and Tromso, and twice against a weakened Aston Villa side in the Capital One Cup. Then there were 11 goals in 16 appearances for Toronto against MLS teams.

The trouble is that Burnley and the other Premier League teams that he will face over the remainder of the season are better than almost all of the above. What is in his favour is that he will be match-fit and have a better understanding with his new team-mates. 'I think he started bright, he was sharp,' Sunderland manager Gus Poyet said. 'I'm sure when he gets that opportunity he will put the ball in the back of the net.'

Defoe jumped straight into the Sunderland starting line up after his transfer from the Major Soccer League

Although he was in familiar surroundings, starting a game at White Hart Lane was something of a novelty for Defoe. Eleven of his 14 Premier League appearances for Tottenham last season were from the bench.

He was cheered by both sets of supporters when his name was read out in the Sunderland team. But in a sense it was as if he had never been away. His photograph still hangs in the press lounge, and he was part of a video montage of past Tottenham greats shown on the big screens before the teams came out.

He started the match playing alongside Steven Fletcher, and his first touch came after three minutes with Sunderland already a goal down to Jan Vertonghen's deflected shot – although it was hardly a glorious entrance into the match as he fell unconvincingly over Vertonghen's challenge, with referee Chris Foy utterly uninterested in appeals for a penalty, to Poyet's dismay.

'If the referee gives a penalty, if he saw what everyone else in the ground saw, we would be talking about a great debut [for Defoe],' Poyet said.

Instead it was proving hard for Defoe, who was already short of match fitness, having not played since October, to adapt to new team-mates and a new system. He strayed offside because a ball was not played through to him quickly enough, he made a run down the side of the defence in anticipation of a pass from Fletcher that was delivered outside the defender rather than inside, so that Defoe found himself trying to deliver a cross from a difficult angle rather than a shot on goal from a more favourable position.

The Paxton Road end, aware of the danger he will always pose, roared to alert Eric Dier to the danger as he dawdled on the ball with Defoe picking up speed behind him. Perhaps it was that fear of what Defoe might do rather than the need to make a tackle that made Vertonghen lunge out at him after the ball had gone on the half hour, conceding a free kick and earning a yellow card. Further punishment was swift as Seb Larsson curled the ball over the wall for Sunderland's equaliser.

It was not the dream debut the Black Cats newcomer had hoped for as he failed to get on the score sheet

Having contributed to his team levelling the score, Defoe then did his bit in defence, holding off Kyle Walker following a corner and this time persuading Foy that he had been fouled. And two minutes before half-time, we thought the moment had arrived as Fletcher found Defoe with a short pass inside the Tottenham penalty area. But a scrum of defenders instantly surrounded him and he had to pivot back to try to make a yard of space and ran out of room.

After a period of Spurs dominance at the beginning of the second half, Sunderland prepared a substitution and we wondered whether Defoe would be summoned, but instead Poyet gave him a new partner, replacing Fletcher with Connor Wickham. However, it was to no avail and when the board went up a second time and Danny Graham moved towards the touchline, time was up for Defoe.

Time, though, will be the judge of the success of his latest move.
