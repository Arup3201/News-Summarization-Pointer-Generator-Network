The 400-year-old chapel in which the Bronte sisters were baptised has been desecrated by stone thieves.

Crowbar-wielding looters ripped up two 200-year-old burial slabs from the graveyard, wrenched stones from the chapel walls, and tore up part of the nearby Bronte Way footpath.

It is feared that they will have thrown away the irreplaceable marked gravestones when they realised they were among their haul of valuable York stone.

Desecrated: Bare earth is exposed where thieves tore up a Yorkshire stone burial slab outside by the old bell chapel in Thornton, West Yorkshire

Volunteers have worked for 12 years to restore the cemetery and Grade Two-listed 'Bronte Bell Chapel', next to St James' Parish Church in the village of Thornton, near Bradford, West Yorkshire.

Although the Brontes are more closely associated with the Parsonage a few miles away in Haworth they were actually born in Thornton where their clergyman father had his living from 1815 to 1820.

All three of the literary sisters and their brother Branwell were baptised in the chapel, where their father Patrick Bronte preached his first sermon about the Duke of Wellington’s 1815 victory over Napoleon at Waterloo.

Organised: It would have taken four men to carry away the two 200-year-old burial slabs

Irreplaceable: The slabs bore inscriptions that were much more detailed than those on the headstones themselves

Patrick once described his years 
in Thornton as 'the happiest in his life', before the family was torn 
apart by the premature deaths of its literary prodigies.

On Saturday, members of the action group set up to restore the site came along to tend the graveyard - and discovered thousands of pounds of damage.

Thieves had removed two horizontal grave
slabs measuring six foot long by three foot wide and four inches thick -
which would take four men to lift.

Greedy: The looters also took pieces of stone from fifteen other graves, and paving slabs from the Bronte Way, a footpath linking Bronte landmarks across Yorkshire

Search: There are concerns that the thieves will have dumped the slabs once they realise their significance

They had also taken slabs from the Bronte Way, a footpath linking points of interest across the moorland that inspired Wuthering Heights.

One of the graves marked the final resting place of tragic John and Mary Pickles and the five children who predeceased them in the 1820s.

The other stone covered the plot of Hannah and James Abbott and their 28-year-old daughter Mary who were all dead by 1828.

The thieves did not touch the actual headstones, but the inscriptions on the slabs were more extensive.

Pieces of York stone had also been removed from the top of 15 other graves.

Coping stones had been ripped from the chapel itself and much of the churchyard footpath torn up.

Historic: The Bronte children were baptised in the chapel (pictured as it was), where their father Patrick was clergyman

Yesterday the attack was roundly condemned by the local people who had worked tirelessly to restore the site, West Yorkshire Police, and civic leaders.

Churchwarden Steven Stanworth, the mastermind of the chapel restoration, was sickened.

'We are proud of our achievements in making Bronte Bell Chapel and surrounding graveyard a place where people can now visit to enjoy its history, beauty and nature.

Literary genius: Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte (left) and Wuthering Heights by Emily (right) are two of the greatest works of nineteenth-century English literature

'It is a historic site and it has been desecrated. This was a despicable and awful crime. Thousands of pounds of stone have been stolen and the graves are irreplaceable.

'The thieves probably dumped them in a hedge or threw them over a wall once they realised there were inscriptions which made them identifiable.

'The action group of nine volunteers have put a lot of hard work in and are devastated.

Family: The Tenant of Wildfell Hall by Anne Bronte (left) is still popular today. Patrick Bronte (right) was parson in Thornton between 1815 and 1820

'It is absolutely disgraceful and disgusting. The morons who did this must be sick and have no respect for life, death or social history.'

'We were celebrating 400 years of its history this year and it has taken the edge off it.'

The graveyard was the final resting place of many local worthies before the last plot was filled in 1965.

The Brontes were one of the most important families in English literary history.

Sisters
Charlotte, Emily and Anne all began to write at an early age at their 
home in Haworth, West Yorkshire. Their stories started as a game based 
around brother Branwell's toy soldiers.

Charlotte's Jane Eyre and Emily's Wuthering Heights are regarded as classics of English literature. Anne's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall remains a huge bestseller.

Emily
and Anne both died of tuberculosis in 1848-9 aged 30 and 29 
respectively. Branwell and Charlotte were also killed by the disease.

Their
deaths added to the heartbreak of clergyman father Patrick Bronte, who 
had already lost two younger children to tuberculosis and his wife to 
cancer.

The gates are left unlocked to allow their ancestors to pay their respects and for families to enjoy the peace and quiet.

The churchwarden added: 'What has happened has been devastating. The two graves taken are over 200 years old and were irreplaceable. It’s totally sad.

'Local stonemasons have been contacted but they do not hold out much hope of getting them back.'

Police patrols were stepped up around St James' Church on Thornton Road after the damage was discovered.

Detective Inspector Mark Long said: 'This is quite clearly a despicable act which will cause great offence in the local community.

'Police are aware of the theft of Yorkshire stone and these gravestones from the church and have been in contact with officials there.

'Unfortunately, there are no positive lines of inquiry at this time despite investigations.

'So we appeal to anyone who has information and furthermore, to any local stonemasons who are offered what are clearly gravestones to contact us.'

Councillor Susan Hinchcliffe, Bradford Council’s portfolio holder for tourism, described the sacrilege as 'sickening'.

She added: 'The Old Bell Chapel has a strong significance to the Bronte story, and is a major tourist draw for the Bradford district. People who commit these crimes throw away hundreds of years of history.'
