Police today appealed for help to trace a couple who had sex inside a lift just feet away from stunned passengers at a busy railway station.

British Transport Police released CCTV footage of a man and woman who officers wish to speak to in connection with the incident, which happened in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, on September 28.

Officers said the pair were in the lift for more than ten minutes during which time she 'performed an indecent act' on the man.

Caught in the act: Police have released CCTV images of this woman and man who allegedly had sex in a lift

PC Kirk Smith said: 'A man and a woman were seen to enter the lift, which connects the station's main subway and ticket barriers to platforms four through to seven.

'They remained in the lift for more than ten minutes and, during this time, the woman performed an indecent act on the man.

'This is particularly concerning, as the station was very busy at the time and other passengers could have entered the lift at any time.'

The officer added: 'We have conducted a number of enquiries and isolated CCTV images of a man and woman we believe may have important information in relation to this incident.

Scene of the crime: The incident happened at Shrewsbury train station (above) on Saturday, September 28

'If you recognise either individual, or have any information that could assist the investigation, I would urge you to contact police.'

'My mate saw them heading into the lift and when the doors shut you could hear lots of groaning and moaning'

Sean Wilson, passenger

Passenger Sean Wilson, 22, said: 'My mate saw them heading into the lift and when the doors shut you could hear lots of groaning and moaning.

'It must have given the CCTV operators a shock. Passengers usually look so miserable as they shuffle onto their trains. They were lucky no-one called it, that's normally used all the time.'

Anyone with information should contact British Transport Police on 0800 40 50 40.
