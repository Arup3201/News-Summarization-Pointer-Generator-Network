Rapist footballer Ched Evans is considering quitting the game and pursuing a new career as a painter decorator after being snubbed by two clubs, it has been claimed.

The former Wales international was jailed for five years after a jury unanimously agreed he raped a drunk woman in a hotel in Rhyl, north Wales.

Evans was released after serving half his sentence but is struggling to find a new club because of the furore over his crime and his lack of contrition.

Now reports have emerged that he is considering ditching the game altogether and setting up his own business.

He completed a decorating course while he was in jail and now wants to make use of his new skills, the Daily Star reports.

Evans continues to protest his innocence and has lodged an appeal with the Criminal Case Review Commission. 

The newspaper quotes a source as saying: 'His earnings used to top £20,000 a week at Sheffield United and now he is scrambling around looking for a club in the lower divisions.

'An outfit like Tranmere would pay about £2,000 a week - and even they don't want him.

'He is thinking he might be better off giving up on football and building a business.' 

Evans was initially given permission by former club Sheffield United to return to train with the club at the request of players’ union, the Professional Footballers Association.

Following his release last month, pressure mounted on Sheffield United not to resign the player or welcome him back to its grounds. 

A string of its patrons tendered their resignations over the issue, with Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill vowing to have her name removed from one of the stands at Bramall Lane should he be reinstated.

Following the backlash - 160,000 people signed a petition against it - the club retracted its offer last week. 

Just days ago Tranmere Rovers chairman Mark Palios claimed he had turned down an approach from associates of the 25-year-old about the possibility of him playing for the League Two club, which is facing a relegation dog fight.

Ched Evans' loyal fiancee Natasha Massey has stood by him and is running the campaign to have his conviction overturned.

Ms Massey appeared alongside Evans in a recent video he made, in which he insisted he was guilty only of infidelity - not the rape he was jailed for. 

MailOnline has yet to receive a response after attempting to contact his representatives for a comment this morning.
