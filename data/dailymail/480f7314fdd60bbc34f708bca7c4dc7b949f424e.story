A Latvian migrant was caught trying to smuggle his wife into Britain in a suitcase after she was twice refused entry to the UK.

Bogden Croitor of Stanmore, London, had been given permission to live in Britain but officials twice refused to allow his Moldovan-born wife to join him.

The 30-year-old travelled to Calais in October 2013 to spend the weekend with his wife in the French port town.

Bogden Croitor was discovered trying to smuggle his Moldovan-born wife into the UK after customs officials stopped his car for a routine stop and search at Dover, pictured 

Canterbury Crown Court heard how Croitor said his wife spoke of how she should join him in the UK and suggested hiding in his luggage.

However, when entering the UK at Dover, customs officials stopped his car for a routine  search.

They then found his wife hiding in his bag.

Natasha Spreadborough, defending, said Croitor’s wife had made numerous applications for a visa but had been refused each time.

Judge Adele Williams sentenced Croitor to 14 months jail suspended for two years.

She told him: 'You could have absolutely no complaint if I had sent you to prison straight away because those who commit this offence normally always go to jail immediately.

'But I take the view that the way you committed this offence does have extraordinary mitigating circumstances attached to it.'

Croitor was also given 100 hours of community service and ordered to pay £400 costs.

It is thought he has returned to his home London after receiving the sentence while his wife has been deported to France.
