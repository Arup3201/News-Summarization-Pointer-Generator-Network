Consultants could face the sack for refusing to work at weekends as part of a shake-up ordered by the NHS’s top doctor.

Professor Sir Bruce Keogh also plans to impose fines of around £12million on hospitals where patients experience poor care on Saturdays and Sundays.

The changes are being brought in after research published in the summer showed that 4,400 lives are being lost needlessly in hospitals every year because of a lack of senior doctors and because key scans and tests are not carried out.

Professor Sir Bruce Keogh plans to impose fines of around £12million on hospitals where patients experience poor care at the weekends

Patients are 16 per cent more likely to die if admitted on a Sunday rather than on a Wednesday, another study found.

But for certain operations it can be much higher. Other research showed that patients who have planned operations at the weekend rather than on a Monday are 82 per cent more likely to die.

At weekends, patients are usually left under the care of junior doctors who may only have a few months’ experience with one or two consultants ‘on-call’ answering their mobile phones from home.

Yesterday senior doctors refused to confirm whether they will ask for more money to work weekends although many believe they deserve higher hourly rates.

The British Medical Association, their union, is holding talks with NHS officials about changes to consultants’ contracts.

BMA chairman Dr Mark Porter would not discuss details of these negotiations but pointed out that hourly rates for nurses and other staff who work weekends is far more attractive.

Sir Bruce, the medical director of NHS
 England, wants to remove a key clause in consultants’ contracts that 
allows them to opt out of non-urgent weekend work.

Patients are 16 per cent more likely to die if admitted on a Sunday rather than a Wednesday and for some operations it can be even higher

This would mean they would be 
sacked for refusing to work at this time, although officials said this 
would only be in the worst circumstances.

Hospitals that fail to have enough 
consultants working over the weekend or to provide X-rays, ultrasound 
scans and other key tests could also be fined up to 2.5 per cent of 
their annual income from the NHS. A typical hospital gets £500million a 
year so the maximum penalty would be £12.5million.

The plans – which will be rolled out 
over the next three years – will mean all patients admitted to hospital 
will see a consultant within 14 hours. Some currently wait three days if
 they come in on a Friday.

Critically-ill
 patients will have X-rays, heart scans, MRI scans or blood tests within
 one hour, urgent cases within 12 hours and everyone else within 24 
hours.

Sir Bruce, NHS 
England’s medical director who is also a heart surgeon, said: ‘It seems 
strange in many ways that we should start to wind down on a Friday 
afternoon and warm up on a Sunday while operating theatres are empty, 
outpatient clinics echo, expensive diagnostic kit isn’t being used and 
in the meantime people are waiting for diagnosis and treatment.

‘When those patients are admitted they get a diagnosis quicker and the appropriate treatment is started more quickly.’

Maria De Jesus died after surgeons removed her ovary instead of her appendix

Mother-to-be Maria De Jesus died after two trainee surgeons operating on a Sunday removed the wrong body part.

The 32-year-old – who was five months’ pregnant with her fourth child – was admitted to Queen’s Hospital in Romford, Essex with appendicitis but medics took out an ovary instead.

She was discharged but forced to return a fortnight later with severe abdominal pain after the untreated appendix caused the onset of the life-threatening blood infection sepsis. 

Mrs De Jesus suffered a miscarriage shortly after being re-admitted in October 2011. 

Just 48 hours later, the teaching assistant died of major organ failure on the operating table just as doctors were finally removing the infected appendix. 

Her husband Adelino, 53, said earlier this year: ‘My wife’s death could have been prevented, I am sure of it.

'By the time they realised how serious the situation was – and they promised us all the best consultants – it was too late.

‘This is neglect, this is an unlawful killing.’

He
 said on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show: ‘That means that patients spend 
less time in hospital and the hospital as a whole runs more efficiently.

‘People
 are still kept waiting at the weekend for a diagnosis. We have a system
 that is not built around the convenience of patients and is not 
compassionate to patients for part of the week.’

If hospitals are relying too 
heavily on junior doctors at weekends, the NHS will force managers to 
bring in consultants in their place. Patients will also be able to have 
minor surgery at the weekend such as for hernias and on hips and knees 
so they do not have to take time off work.

British Medical Association chairman Dr Mark Porter would not say whether it would ask for more money consultants to work weekends

Sir
 Bruce added: ‘Why should somebody have to take time off work, why 
should someone else have to take time off work to take them to and from 
hospital, when, if they were to have their operations on a Saturday, 
they could spend Sunday recovering and, in many cases, get back to work 
sooner?’

The Care Quality Commission watchdog has been urged to check for levels of weekend care during routine inspections of hospitals.

NHS England – which runs the Health Service – estimates the plans will cost the NHS an extra £1billion a year. Its annual budget is about £105billion.

But BMA chairman Dr Porter said other NHS staff including X-ray specialists, administration staff and social workers also needed to work at weekends to ensure high levels of care.

He refused to comment on whether the BMA would ask for more money for consultants to work weekends as part of discussions about their contract. Nurses currently get time and a half for working weekends while doctors receive time and a third, he said.

A survey of 4,500 consultants by the BMA in September found that most were in favour of ‘increased financial remuneration’ for working in the evening and at weekends.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘Patients should be at the heart of the NHS and be able to depend on it every day – not just Monday to Friday.’

The weekend working shake-up follows a number of key studies which warned that patients are far more likely to die or suffer major complications if they are admitted at the weekend.

NHS England has calculated that 4,400 lives could be saved every year if hospitals offered the same level of care at weekends as they do during the week.

Patients undergoing planned surgery on Saturday or Sunday are 82 per cent more likely to die than if they have their operation on a Monday, according to a study by researchers at Imperial College London published in the spring.

Last year, scientists from University College London found patients are 16 per cent more likely to die if they are admitted on a Sunday compared to a Wednesday.

The figure for Saturday was 11 per cent. Other studies also revealed an alarming difference in weekend death rates between hospitals. 

Hillingdon in West London had a rate of 27 per cent, while it was 25 per cent at the Royal Cornwall, according to Dr Foster research.

Only last month, a report by the National Audit Office discovered that babies are 13 per cent more likely to come harm if they are born at the weekend than during the week.
