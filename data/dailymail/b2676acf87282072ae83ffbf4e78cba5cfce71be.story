Manchester United's win against Crystal Palace on Saturday was only their third by a 1-0 scoreline in the 49 Premier League games played since Sir Alex Ferguson retired. 

It's a result more readily associated with George Graham's Arsenal than the all-singing cast at Old Trafford but Louis van Gaal won't care with a top-four finish his over-riding priority this season.

In fact, the way Van Gaal set up his team for a home game against struggling Palace encouraged a tight match in which United could maintain a possession stranglehold of the game and eventually prevail.

Having spent £158million over the summer, van Gaal had become worried by United's soft underbelly, and the ease in which his team had conceded five at Leicester City, four at MK Dons and failed to beat Chelsea or Manchester City in their last two games.

This is how the United manager stopped playing fantasy football – and delivered a win. 

1: THE RETURN OF MICHAEL CARRICK

Having suffered ankle ligament damage in Van Gaal's first week in the job, this was a first start of the season for the England man.

He was asked to sit in front of the back four, give United controlled possession of the ball and be alert to any Palace counter-attacks. It didn't make for gung-ho excitement but United finished the game with 72 per cent possession and Juan Mata took the one chance that counted.

2: WAYNE ROONEY, MIDFIELDER

On paper, the United formation looked as if it would pan out as a 4-4-2 with Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney up front. In reality it was 4-1-4-1 with Carrick sitting and Rooney playing alongside Marouane Fellaini in central midfield.

For a home game against Crystal Palace, David Moyes would undoubtedly have been criticised for negativity if he'd used a similar system. But with United having started the weekend a lowly 10th, Van Gaal simply decided on a zero-risk policy, particularly with four centre halves unavailable through injury and suspension.

Rooney wasn't a stand-out performer but he was disciplined, kept the ball moving and did venture forward at the right times, firing two shots wide.

3: NO MORE FAMOUS FIVE

The hype had us believe that Van Persie-Rooney-Mata-Falcao-Di Maria were going to be United's answer to Tottenham's attacking quintet of Klinsmann-Sheringham-Dumitrescu-Barmby-Anderton. Their attitude was that no matter how many the opposition would score, they would score more.

Van Gaal has clearly decided such a line-up and approach is unworkable in reality. Only Van Persie and Rooney stayed on the pitch for 90 minutes on Saturday, and Rooney spent it in midfield rather than attack.

Mata started on the bench and soon after he came on, Di Maria made way to keep the balance right and help preserve United's slender lead. Falcao hasn't played for a couple of weeks because of a training ground injury that hasn't been fully explained, and even when he returns there is no guarantee he'll be ahead of teenager James Wilson in the pecking order.

4: DI MARIA SACRIFICED FOR THE TEAM

Soon after he'd completed his record £60million move to United, Di Maria was the star of the show for Argentina against Germany in a rematch of the World Cup final, his heat map showing he appeared all over the field to score and set up goals.

But his thrilling brand of football is also risky when attacking moves break down and United had been wounded in previous games, the problem compounded by having to make so many changes in defence.

So on Saturday, Van Gaal asked Di Maria to stay wide on the left and not to desert his post; no wandering, no dragging the team out of position.

For the Argentine, it was difficult; Palace defended so deep and often doubled up on him, so there was no space. He was replaced with 20 minutes to go, soon after supplying the assist for Mata's strike. Van Gaal was sympathetic and his estimation of Di Maria has probably gone up after his selfless efforts.

Not every superstar sacrifices his skills for the team cause at a cost to their own performance.

5: BALANCE AT THE BACK

Ironically, Van Gaal's predecessor Moyes was a huge fan of having one right-footed centre back play alongside one left-footed centre back. At Everton, he insisted on it as an unbreakable rule – no matter which individuals might be left out as a result.

Van Gaal took a leaf out of Moyes' book and brought in midfielder Daley Blind to replace the injured Marcos Rojo, mainly because he is a natural left-footer.

Teenager Paddy McNair and Blind therefore had the right-left combination at the heart of United's defence and though they gave up one chance to Fraizer Campbell by leaving a cross to each other, their overall partnership was good given their clear inexperience of the Premier League – just nine previous starts between them.
