An Australian man has unveiled a dinosaur fossil he claims tells the Bible's story and also proves humans lived alongside the extinct creatures just a few thousand years ago.

Ken Ham, who founded the Creation Museum in the U.S. and is building a $80 million Noah's ark, showed the remains of the nine-metre long Allosaurus skeleton called Ebenezer on Saturday.

Resembling a Tyrannosaurus rex, the fossil is featured in a new exhibit called Facing the Allosaurus.

Answers in Genesis, the Christian ministry that owns the Creation Museum, states about 50 per cent of the skeleton's bones were found in Colorado more than a 10 years ago.

The museum claims the dinosaur died in a worldwide flood about 4,300 years ago, while scientists say the last dinosaurs roamed the earth more than 60 million years ago.

Mr Ham said the display will help defend the book of Genesis and expose the scientific problems with evolution, reported Ninemsn.

'Evolutionists use dinosaurs to reach children more than anything to promote their worldview,' Ham said. 'Our museum uses dinosaurs to help tell their true history according to the Bible.'

Mr Ham, a former Queensland science teacher, garnered intense media attention after discussing a worldwide flood, as documented in the Old Testament, in a debate with science educator Bill Nye at the Creation Museum in February.

Watched by millions of people via live web stream, Mr Nye challenged the Biblical story when he described how animals would have behaved in such a flood.

'(If) there was a big flood on the earth, you would expect drowning animals to swim up to a higher level,' he said.

This would have allowed their bones to be mix with fossils from later time periods and Mr Nye used the Grand Canyon as an example.

'Not any one of them did, not a single one,' he said.

With a strong emphasis on the Bible, the Creation Museum features many Biblical displays

Kentucky Paleontological Society president Daniel Phelps said via release on Thursday, the Creation Museum has decided without doing research, that the dinosaur fossil is evidence of Noah's flood.

The Elizabeth Streb Peroutka Foundation, which purchased the bones more than a decade ago, donated the Allosaurus to the museum.

Member of the foundation Michael Peroutka, who was also the Constitution Party's presidential candidate in 2004, said the fossil is a testimony to the creative power of God in designing dinosaurs.

He also added that it was evidence to the truth of a worldwide catastrophic flooding of the earth in Noah's time.

Mark Clementz, a paleontologist at the University of Wyoming said the Allosaurus was a large carnivore that lived in North America in the late Jurassic period about 150 million years ago.
