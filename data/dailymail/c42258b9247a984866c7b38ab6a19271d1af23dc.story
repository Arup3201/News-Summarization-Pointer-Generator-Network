Three bodies have been found in plastic bags in East Cleveland, police said on Saturday.

A woman's body was found on Friday in a garage and two other bodies were found on Saturday - one in a nearby backyard and the other in the basement of a vacant house.

Police said the two bodies found on Saturday were also female but they do not yet know the identities of any of the victims or the cause of death. All of the women were black and each body was wrapped in four or five plastic bags. The bodies have been sent to the coroner's office.

A 35-year-old man was arrested after a two-and-a-half hour standoff with police on Friday.

Police did not immediately release the suspect's name because he has not been charged. Police Commander Mike Cardilli said more details would be released shortly. The suspect was in East Cleveland Jail on Saturday night.

All three people are believed to have been killed in the last six to 10 days. The first woman to be found was described as 5'3 and 110 pounds, according to Cleveland.com.

A second victim was discovered 150 feet from the carport where the first victim as found. She was in a lot with heavy weeds. Norton said she had a tattoo of a pink flower with green leaves on her left thigh.

The third woman was found in a basement of a vacant house adjacent to the overgrown lot.

Norton told The Plain Dealer it appeared that woman, who was wearing a purple top with a leopard print pattern, had been thrown through a window into the basement.

Police searched other vacant houses in the neighborhood on Saturday for other possible victims.

'I don't know if there are anymore bodies out there,' Norton told the newspaper. 'It is all tying back to the same guy.'

Police, the FBI, the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Department went through yards and abandoned houses in the area where all three bodies were found. They used dogs trained to find cadavers. The search ended around 11 p.m.

East Cleveland's mayor told WEWS television station that it will continue from noon on Sunday.

In 2011, Anthony Sowell was found guilty of killing 11 women and hiding their remains around his Cleveland home. He was sentenced to death, and remains in prison.
