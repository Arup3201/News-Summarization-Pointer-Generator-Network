Ministers resisting to billions of pounds in budget cuts will be shamed into explaining themselves to a medieval-style Star Chamber.

Chancellor George Osborne will convene the panel of senior figures who have agreed a fresh round of spending cuts to put pressure on those grill the departments who refuse to fall into line.

One of those likely to face the Star Chamber, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, today signalleed that he is ready to block cuts which threaten Britain’s ‘military capabilities’ risking a new Whitehall stand-off with the Treasury.

Ministers have been told to help find £11.5billion in extra savings for 2015-16. So far he has raised of £2.5billion, after seven departments including justice, energy and the Foreign Office signed off cuts of up to 10 per cent.

But big spending ministers, including Mr Hammond, Home Secretary Theresa May, Business Secretary Vince Cable and Environment Secretary Owen Paterson are resisting demands for the deepest  cuts.

They all faced being hauled before the
Star Chamber – officially called the PEX Cabinet Committee – to be 
cross-examined by ministers who have already settled their budgets with 
the Treasury.

Mr Osborne 
insisted he would not let ministers ‘off the hook’ by calling for more 
benefits cuts instead of adjusting their own spending.

But Mr Hammond risked the ire of the 
Chancellor when he refused to offer cuts to the armed forces beyond 
efficiency savings in the way the Ministry of Defence is run.

Mr
Hammond said: ‘We can look for efficiency savings, which everybody 
should be seeking all the time and however many times you've done it you
can always go back and have another look.

The threat of the Star Chamber for ministers who refuse to sign up to cuts is real - and has worked in the past.

In 2010, George Osborne warned those dragging their feet that they would be grilled by Cabinet colleagues and they all fell into line.

This time tensions are higher and ministers who agreed cuts last time are not more reluctant.

The idea of a Star Chamber dates back to the 15th Century, and was a court of justice which sat in the Palace of Westminster.

It took its name from stars painted on the ceiling of the room built during the rein of King Edward II.

It was made up of Privy Councillors and judges and sat in judgement on people considered too powerful and prominent to be dealt with by ordinary courts.

It sat in secret with no witnesses, and was often used and abused by the monarchy to target enemies.

The Star Chamber will meet in the Cabinet Office Conference Room.

A source said: ‘The room was purpose 
built as the Treasury board room in the 1750s.

'Throughout its history, 
the role of the Treasury Board has been to approve expenditure, grants, 
fines and taxes.'

‘But we should be very clear that there is a difference between efficiency savings, which may be difficult to achieve but are painless in terms of the impact on the front line, and output cuts, which are of a very different order and require proper and mature consideration across government about the impact that they will have on our military capabilities.’

He said he was ready to have an ‘adult conversation’ about ‘what we reasonably can do’ in terms of efficiency savings in his department.

The Treasury hopes that just the threat of having to appear at the Star Chamber will embarrass ministers into agreeing cuts.

During the 2010 Spending Review all government departments chose to settle their budgets rather than be grilled by Cabinet colleagues.

But the negotiations have been more fraught this time round, with some ministers angry that they are being cut again while the NHS, international aid, defence equipment and schools budgets remain protected.

Each Cabinet minister is expected to agree their cuts with the Treasury directly.

Those that refuse will have to appear in front of the PEX Cabinet Committee, which is chaired by Mr Osborne and Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury.

Yesterday it emerged that seven departments had agreed cuts worth £1billion, including the Ministry of Justice, Department for Communities and Local Government, Foreign Office, Department for Energy and Climate Change, Northern Ireland Office, the Treasury and the Cabinet Office.

The cuts amount to almost 10 per cent of their combined budgets, higher than the eight per cent targeted by the spending review as a whole.

As a result the minister in charge - Ed Davey, Chris Grayling, William Hague, Francis Maude, Eric Pickles and Theresa Villliers – have been invited to join the Star Chamber.

Ken Clarke and Oliver Letwin have also been invited to join.

It is expected to meet at least twice in the final weeks of the spending review, before Mr Osborne makes a statement to Parliament on June 26.

The Chancellor is understood to be delighted that seven departments have already signed off savings of up to 10 per cent, including Justice Secretary Chris Grayling and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles who were reported to be resisting cuts.

A Treasury source said: 'We are impress by Eric and Chris. Clearly these are ministers who have put their money where their mouth is and are very serious about making sure every penny of taxpayers' money is spent effectively.'

However, Mr Osborne has made clear to other ministers yet to settle cuts will that he will not be diverted by calls for more benefits cuts.

The benefits cap, announced last year limiting increases in working age benefits to one per cent, is already due to raise £3.4billion in 2015-16.

Mr Osborne said: 'We are cutting welfare and we’re cutting welfare for the future as well.

‘We’re going to make sure that no family that stays at home on benefits gets more than the average family going out to work and we’re also making sure that welfare bills don’t go up faster than wages, so there are big savings in welfare.

‘But I would also say that’s not an excuse to let Whitehall off the hook.

'We’ve also got to make savings there so we can fix our economy, bring that deficit down and spend on the things people want us to spend on like the NHS, like the infrastructure that’s going to create jobs in the future.’

Several Tory ministers have called for deeper cuts to benefits to help balance the books.
