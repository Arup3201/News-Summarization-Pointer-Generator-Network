Sainsbury’s is cutting ties with a trendy cookery writer after she said David Cameron should resign for using his ‘dead son’ as a front to privatise the NHS.

Jack Monroe was the face of budget cooking for the supermarket chain, but last night it emerged that her contract would not be renewed after she posted an ill-advised tweet about the Prime Minister.

The mother-of-one starred in ads for Sainsbury’s Value Range and was employed on a fixed-term contract to write a food blog.

Mother: Jack Monroe repeatedly writes heart-rending stories about trying to feed her young son Johnny

Prime Minister: David Cameron with his son Ivan, who had cerebral palsy and epilepsy. Ivan died in 2009

But on Sunday Miss Monroe, 26, wrote on Twitter that Mr Cameron should go because he ‘uses stories about his dead son as misty-eyed rhetoric to legitimise selling our NHS to his friends’.

The Prime Minister’s son Ivan, who suffered from cerebral palsy and epilepsy, died aged six in 2009.

Mr Cameron has spoken about his admiration for the NHS and how it helped care for his son. At the last Tory conference, he questioned how Labour could ‘dare’ to claim he does not care about the Health Service when it had been so important to his family.

Last night Miss Monroe, who also writes for The Guardian, said she was standing by her comments, which Tory backbenchers branded sick and distasteful.

Miss Monroe, who lives in west London with her partner Allegra McEvedy, the co-founder of restaurant chain Leon, said: ‘I stand by the fact that I don’t think that [David Cameron] should be using rhetoric about his son to prop up policies that he hasn’t stood by himself.

This morning, small boy had one of the last Weetabix, mashed with water, with a glass of tap water to wash it down with. ‘Where’s Mummy’s breakfast?’ he asks, big blue eyes and two year old concern.

Tomorrow, my small boy will be introduced to the world of pawnbroking, watching as his mother hands over the TV and the guitar for an insulting price.’

From a speech she delivered at the TUC on 9 September 2013. Published in the Guardian 10 September 2013.

And you think if you admit to skipping meals, to feeding your child the same cold pasta for nights on end, you think if anyone notices the badly damaged wrists from your recent suicide attempt, that you might lose your son. He might be taken into care. And despite the cold and the despair and the mind raging with doubt and fear and uselessness, there’s a little boy that relies on you to provide his meals – no matter how rubbish they are – and to put his jumper on before he goes to bed at night.

Guardian, 11 September 2014

Poverty is the sinking feeling when your child finishes his one Weetabix and says: ‘More, Mummy? Bread and jam, please, Mummy,’ as you’re trying to work out how to carry the TV to the pawn shop, and how to tell him that there is no bread and jam.

‘He does use it as a means to shut down debates, or if anybody says anything about disability he comes out and says: “You can’t say anything about disability,” when actually he doesn’t come from the same place as a lot of parents of disabled children, who may not have the money to afford top of the range healthcare for their kids or might be living in cramped accommodation etc etc, so I do stand by what I said.

‘I didn’t do it in the most sensitive manner but you know Twitter is a fairly limiting place to try to express yourself.’

She added: ‘I regret not thinking about it a bit harder but we all do things that when you look at the next day that you go “I could have done that a bit better, or a bit more sensitively”.’

Sainsbury’s came under pressure from customers who urged the supermarket chain to end its relationship with Miss Monroe.

David Webster tweeted: ‘Jack Monroe’s comments regarding David Cameron’s deceased son are deplorable. I hope that @sainsburys reconsider her employment.’

Andrew Havery said: ‘#boycottsainsburys until they get rid of heartless leftist @MsJackMonroe.’

Dwayne Pipe posted: ‘I quite like @sainsburys, but every time I now walk into one of their shops I will be thinking of Jack Monroe’s dead kid tweet. Not good.’

Sainsbury’s issued a statement, saying: ‘Jack Monroe blogs independently. Sainsbury’s is not a political organisation and we certainly don’t share her views.’

A source revealed that the supermarket would no longer be working with the food writer whose contract is to expire in the not too distant future.

Grammar school-educated Miss Monroe was branded a hypocrite by those who said she often wrote about her son Johnny in her blog and in other publications.

The blog led to a publishing deal and regular stints on the Guardian. 

Andrew Percy, a Tory member of the Commons health select committee, said: ‘This is not just a distasteful tweet, it is sick.

‘If a Right-Wing politician or columnist had made such a comment, Miss Monroe would be writing hand-wringing columns about how evil or cruel such a comment was.’

Charlotte Leslie, Tory member of the health select committee, added: ‘Anyone of any integrity is left pretty speechless. 

'Not only is this incredibly callous and hurtful from someone who is supposed to be in a position of some responsibility, it is also utterly inaccurate.
