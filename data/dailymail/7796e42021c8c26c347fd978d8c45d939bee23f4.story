Nos 50-41: Includes Albert Luque, David Ngog and Claudio Pizarro. 

The centre forward: The leader from the front, the No 9, the provider, the talisman, the goalscorer. Since 1992, the Premier League has been blessed with the best, from homegrown talents Alan Shearer and Andy Cole, to foreign imports Tony Yeboah and Thierry Henry, but unfortunately there have also been some major disappointments.

Whether failing to justify their huge price tag, or just incapable of hitting a barn door, there have been some dreadful forwards in England's top flight. As we build-up to the return of the Premier League following the international break, Sportsmail runs you through Nos 40-31 of the worst strikers to have ever played in the division... do you agree?

40) Jon Dahl Tomasson (Newcastle United)

Tomasson went on to win the Champions League and Serie A with AC Milan, the UEFA Cup and Eredivisie with Feyenoord and the Bundesliga with Stuttgart - yet the Dane was utterly hopeless during his season at Newcastle United.

Arriving as a fresh-faced 21-year-old in 1997 for £2.2million from Heerenveen, Tomasson simply was not strong enough to cope with the Premier League and found himself bullied by opposition defenders.

He was shifted forward to the striker position from his preferred attacking midfield role due to an injury to Alan Shearer and managed just three goals in 23 league appearances for the Magpies. Newcastle fans are still to this day bemused as to how Tomasson scored 52 goals in 112 games for Denmark - because his talent certainly went missing when he was on Tyneside.

39) Erik Meijer (Liverpool)

Remembered fondly for singing and drinking with Liverpool fans in Dortmund before the 2001 UEFA Cup final, Meijer's actual footballing ability is not reminisced about in quite such a positive manner.

The Dutchman moved to Liverpool in 1999 on a free transfer having torn Bundesliga defences to shreds in partnership with Ulf Kirsten at Bayer Leverkusen. Though Meijer himself physically upped sticks and moved to England, his form remained firmly in Germany.

No goals arrived during in 24 Premier League games during his two-year stay on Merseyside and he was loaned out to Preston North End (where he also failed to score...) before leaving for Hamburg. Well, at least he knew how to enjoy a pint anyway...

Darko Kovacevic signed for Sheffield Wednesday from Red Star Belgrade in 1996 but scored just four goals in 16 Premier League games

38) Darko Kovacevic (Sheffield Wednesday)

When you sign a striker who has just scored an incredible 37 goals in 47 games for Red Star Belgrade in a £2m deal, you expect to be getting a bit of a bargain.

But Serbian Kovacevic's spell in the Steel City in 1996 was not one he will want to remember in a hurry. Four goals did arrive in 16 Premier League appearances, including two on his debut against Bolton Wanderers, but he departed less than six months after his arrival to head to Spain with Real Sociedad.

Kovacevic was criticised for his poor heading ability, his poor first touch and lack of movement - but apart from that, Owls fans thought he was incredible... 

37) Jozy Altidore (Hull City and Sunderland)

The American has 74 caps for his country - just let that sink in for a second.

Incredibly, Altidore has scored everywhere he has been - except in England. He netted 15 league goals for New York Red Bulls and 39 for AZ Alkmaar - as well as bagging 24 international goals to date for the USA - but has managed just two strikes in the Premier League.

A season-long loan move to Hull City in 2009 from Villarreal yielded just a solitary goal in 28 games during his first spell in England, but his second stint in the Premier League was supposed to be the making of him. Having recovered his form in Holland in blistering style, Altidore was signed by Sunderland in 2013 for £6.5m but has netted just once in 33 league games since. Sometimes Jozy, things just aren't meant to be...

Despite being a prolific scorer for the USA national team, Altidore's record with Hull City and Sunderland is appalling 

36) Konstantinos Mitroglou (Fulham)

Steve Marlet was considered a waste of money at Loftus Road, but Mitroglou arguably tops that.

During their ill-fated relegation campaign last season, Fulham splashed £12m on the Greece international in January in a bid to stave off the drop - but their investment proved to be a disastrous one.

Mitroglou had scored 41 league goals in 92 appearances for Olympiacos but injuries plagued him during his time in west London and he managed just three Premier League games for Fulham. Instead of being their saviour, he turned in to their benchwarmer instead. He returned to the Greek champions on loan in August but it is safe to say Fulham fans will not be worried if he doesn't return.

35) Rolando Bianchi (Manchester City)

Manchester City can spend £8.8m nowadays and not even bat an eyelid - but when they parted with that sum to sign Bianchi from Reggina in July 2007, they were counting on recruiting a top striker.

The Italian was given the No 10 shirt at the Sky Blues and scored on his debut against West Ham United but things quickly went downhill from there.

Bianchi lambasted English cuisine and was scathing in his views on the British alcohol culture - insisting he needed to return to Italy in order to progress as a player and earn international recognition. He scored four Premier League goals in 19 games before heading on loan to Lazio in January 2008 and then signing permanently for Torino that summer. He has enjoyed his pizza and pasta back home ever since.

34) Andriy Voronin (Liverpool)

The Ukrainian striker was slow - a snail caught in a trail of treacle could move around the pitch quicker - and this greatly affected his success in England.

Having signed for Liverpool on a free transfer from Bayer Leverkusen in July 2007, he originally impressed on his debut - with Rafa Benitez even insisting that he was 'clever', had 'great game awareness' and gave Liverpool 'many more options in attack'. That opinion was to be short-lived, however...

With just five league goals in his first season on Merseyside, Voronin was loaned to Hertha Berlin before returning to Anfield for another year. He was sold to Dynamo Moscow for £4m in 2010 having netted just five goals in 27 Premier League appearances. He has not been missed.

33) Helder Postiga (Tottenham Hotspur)

Having just won the Portuguese title with Porto, 20-year-old Postiga was lauded as a brilliant signing for Tottenham Hotspur when they snapped him up for what seemed a very reasonable starting price of £6.25m in 2003.

But the striker struggled to adapt to the Premier League - never coping with the pace, power and intensity of matches - and Spurs fans soon became disillusioned with his performances. His rating as one of the best strikers in Europe was quickly revised as he scored just once in 19 Premier League games.

Incredibly, Postiga was supposedly wanted by Jose Mourinho while in charge at Real Madrid but the deal failed to materialise. Chelsea fans beware - if Mourinho really does rate Postiga, he could find himself at Stamford Bridge in the not-too-distant future...

32) Grzegorz Rasiak (Tottenham Hotspur and Bolton Wanderers)

Polish forward Rasiak had scored 16 in 35 for Derby County, convincing Spurs to pay £3m for him in August 2005 due to their desperate need for a striker.

As soon as he arrived at White Hart Lane, however, it became clear he was not a Premier League footballer. Martin Jol had described his as a 'tall target man; a hard-working, honest player with a good goal-scoring record.' So, what happened to it at Spurs?

Rasiak struggled to control a ball, he was slow and just did not look at home on the pitch in England's top flight, leading Spurs fans to view him as a laughing stock. He failed to score in any of his eight Premier League appearances and was loaned to Southampton. The Saints then signed him permanently before he spent time at Bolton Wanderers, again failing to score in seven Premier League games. He was just awful unfortunately.

31) Massimo Maccarone (Middlesbrough)

Maccarone signed for £8.15m from Empoli in 2002 after dazzling at the European Under 21 Championship and Middlesbrough had been forced to hold off strong competition from other clubs. The Italian started well on Teesside but scored just 18 Premier League goals in 81 games during five years at the Riverside Stadium.

He was loaned to Parma and Siena before moving to the latter permanently in 2007 on a free transfer - having spent half a decade failing to light up the English game.

Although Middlesbrough fans remember him fondly for his workrate, endeavour and attitude, his obvious lack of footballing ability ensured they were tearing their hair out when it came to watching the Italian in front of goal. His record at most other clubs is fairly solid, but on Teesside it was woeful.
