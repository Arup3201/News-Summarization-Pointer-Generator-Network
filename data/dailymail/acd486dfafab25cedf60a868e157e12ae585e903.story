Bernadette Horton, 46, was taken to Glan Clwyd Hospital with pneumonia

A seriously ill patient was treated in an NHS store room surrounded by cardboard boxes because the overstretched hospital was ‘too full’ to give her a bed.

Bernadette Horton, 46, was taken to the tiny room with no central heating and put on a makeshift camp bed after being admitted to the A&E department at Glan Clwyd Hospital in north Wales struggling for breath and hallucinating.

Despite being barely conscious as a result of serious pneumonia, doctors allegedly said the mother-of-four would be better off at home as there was no room for her.

She was also told she would be unable to have the X-ray she needed because the equipment was faulty.

She claims there were four doctors in the department, two nurses and one healthcare assistant working during the chaotic shift at Glan Clwyd hospital A&E unit in north Wales.

Mrs Horton, from Prestatyn, who is now recovering at home, said: ‘Staff in hospitals do care about their patients but there are not enough of them to cope.

‘Wards have been shut and there are not enough beds for patients.

‘Staff are doing their best in impossible circumstances with poor resources, yet they are demoralised on a daily basis.’

Last year Department of Health figures revealed that nearly 67,000 patients waited up to 12 hours on a trolley or parked in side rooms over a six-month period.

This may simply be the tip of the iceberg, as NHS analysts say clever number-crunching by hospitals may be hiding the true extent of the problem.

Mrs Horton added: ‘My husband found out that there were four doctors in the department, two nurses and one healthcare assistant. And this was a mid-week Wednesday, not a weekend.

‘Staff were overrun with sheer numbers of people to treat, and there were simply not enough of them to cope. The doctor apologised for the room they had to use temporarily.

‘It was a store room with boxes in, with a makeshift treatment bed installed and no heating. It felt very cold but as my temperature was high, I did not care.

‘The doctor made routine investigations and said I needed an X-ray, as this would show up pneumonia for definite.

'But he explained the X-ray department was “down” currently.

Mrs Horton, who is pictured with husband Barrie, was deemed to be too ill to wait in the waiting room so was told to sit in a staff meeting room while she awaited treatment

‘He told me: “The hospital is full. 
There are no beds currently. It's midnight and I fear that if you were 
to wait for a bed, you would be here all night in a chair until the day 
staff come on shift. I can give you the antibiotics needed, but to be 
frank, you will be better off in your own bed at home than waiting 
here”.’

The
incident occurred after Mrs Horton suffered two weeks of cold and flu 
symptoms and was taken to the hospital by her husband, Barrie.

Nurses initially deemed her too ill to sit in the waiting room and instead sent her to wait in a nearby staff meeting room.

But Mrs Horton was then taken to the cold storeroom as staff needed the meeting room.

Mrs Horton, who has now started a blog called 'Mum vs Austerity' to campaign against NHS cuts, said: ‘I was gasping for breath, had a hacking repeated cough, a high temperature and the straw that broke the camel's back - hallucinations. At hospital I could not hold my head up and lolled to one side in the chair.

‘The triage nurse assessed me and queried pneumonia. I was then told I would have to wait for the doctor, but the waiting room was not ideal for me so I was put in a nurses meeting room.

Mrs Horton, who is pictured with sons Luca and Joseph, was then moved to be treated in a store room on a camp bed because the staff room was needed and there were no spare beds

‘I was wheeled past a corridor full 
of sick people on trolleys, past the packed waiting room and the 
cubicles, which were all full, and into the nurses meeting room.

‘A healthcare assistant brought me some water and then scurried away. My husband asked a passing nurse whether there was anywhere I could lie down as I was in danger of falling out if the wheelchair as I could not hold my head up and was lolling to one side.

‘She said everywhere was full, but she would see how long I had to wait to see the doctor as she could see I was very ill. My husband then asked for a pillow to support me, but was told there were none available and was offered a rolled up blanket.’

Mr Horton was then called away to pick up one of the couple’s children - forcing him to leave Mrs Horton at the hospital.

She said: ‘The nurse said it may take "some time" to be seen then asked me if I could wait in the foyer as they needed the room.

‘I replied I could not get up and walk as I was very weak. She said she did not have the time to wheel me into the foyer, so I would have to walk as best I could.

Mrs Horton needed an X-ray to confirm that she had pneumonia but was told that this was not possible as the equipment was faulty

‘I only remember blurred visions of people passing by. I managed to get there and waited for my husband to return. A couple of teenagers asked me if I was alright as I was slumped in the chair.

‘My husband returned and he later said he was so shocked and angry that I was dumped in a chair by the front door, that words failed him.

‘When I returned home I saw a practice GP and my husband related the hospital experience and the GP agreed it was totally unacceptable. He said he had heard of patients being sent to another hospital some 50 miles away.’

Glan Clwyd Hospital came under fire in December last year in a damning report by the Health Inspectorate of Wales which said the best efforts of ‘committed’ A&E staff at the Bodelwyddan hospital were being undermined by ‘inadequate premises, poor communication and a lack of clinical leadership’.

Meanwhile a  report released in February found that urgent changes were needed in NHS staffing after more than half of dignity spot-checks in Wales’ hospitals raised concerns about patient safety.

Opposition parties, patient safety groups and leading medical organisations have all said that low staffing levels on hospital wards, particularly at night, is putting patients at risk.

A spokesman for the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said: ‘We are very sorry that Mrs Horton feels let down by the care provided to her.

This is not the type of care we want to provide for our patients at all.

‘During the last few weeks we have faced significant pressures, along with the rest of Wales, due to a rise in the number of seriously ill patients being admitted to hospital.

Mrs Horton is now writing a blog called Mum vs Austerity to campaign against NHS cuts

‘Our doctors and nurses are working 
extremely hard to cope with increased pressure on beds as patients need 
to stay longer in hospital to recover than normal.’

The
news of Mrs Horton’s experience at Glan Clwyd Hospital comes just two 
months after it was revealed that a father died of meningitis after 
doctors at the hospital dismissed his symptoms as swollen joints.

Marciano Nolan, 46, contracted a rare form of the disease but medics dismissed his symptoms as swollen joints and later said it was simply a virus 'doing the rounds'. His condition rapidly deteriorated and he died four days after he first felt ill.

The same hospital also came under scrutiny in 2011 after it was revealed that a surgeon needlessly amputated a woman’s leg.

Amit Sinha, an orthopaedic consultant at the hospital carried out an above knee amputation on Michelle Richards' right leg in 2006 after diagnosing osteomyeltitis, a serious and potentially life-threatening bone infection.

Mrs Richards, from Towyn, Conwy, already had a below-the-knee amputation on the same leg in 1995, partially as a result of her spina bifida.

But, after the operation, subsequent tests - carried out at the insistence of the mother-of-three - found no evidence of the disease and Mrs Richards was told: 'Sorry there's been a mistake.'
