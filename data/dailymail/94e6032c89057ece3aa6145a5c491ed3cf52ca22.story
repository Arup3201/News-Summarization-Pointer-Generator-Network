He’s proved that electric cars can be sexy and has designed his own spacecraft.

Now Elon Musk is setting his sights on satellites and wants to use them to connect remote parts of the world to the internet - an aim shared by other tech companies.

The billionaire entrepreneur is reportedly exploring ways to create small and cheap satellites. 

High flier:  Elon Musk (pictured) is setting his sights on satellites and wants to use them to get remote parts of the world online. The billionaire entrepreneur is reportedly exploring ways to create small and cheap satellites in a project that would pit him against Google and Facebook

He is working with Greg Wyler, a satellite expert and former Google employee who was involved until recently with developing Google's bid to get less developed parts of the world online, The Wall Street Journal reported. 

The race is on to connect the two-thirds of the planet without internet access, with Google and Facebook both announcing grand plans to roll out access using satellites, drones and even giant balloons.

Mr Wyler founded WorldVu Satellites, based in the Channel Islands, which controls a large block of radio spectrum and is said to talking to industry executives – along with Mr Musk – about plans to launch around 700 satellites, each weighing just 250lbs (113kg).

The satellites would be half the weight of the smallest kind used at the moment and the constellation would be 10 times the size of the largest commercial fleet.

The duo may build a factory to make the satellites, either in Florida or Colorado.

Two-thirds of the world still remain without internet access. Google is planning to change this by launching a fleet of 180 satellites to provide web access for the 4.8 billion people not yet online and now Elon Musk and an ex-Google employee plan to launch around 700 satellites in an even larger project

Elon musk wants to use satellites to provide internet access to remote parts of the planet.

He said to be involved in developing cheap and small satellites with expert Greg Wyler, of WorldVu Satellites.

The duo plan on launching 700 satellites which would be 10 times the size of the largest commercial fleet.

They would each weigh just 250lbs (113kg) - half the weight of the current lightest commercial offering.

The duo is considering opening a factory in Florida or Colorado to build their creations for a cost of at least $1 billion (£600 million).

Any satellites produced would likely be launched by Mr Musk’s firm Space X but there are many obstacles in the way.

Any satellites produced would likely be launched by Mr Musk’s firm Space X, which has 48 launches planned by 2018. 

Last month, the company won a $2.6 billion (1.6 billion) contract to develop, test and fly ‘space taxis’ for Nasa in order to put US astronauts into orbit.

However, there are many obstacles that need to be overcome before the satellites are deemed a success.

They are predicted to cost $1 billion (£600 million) to develop and may be able to be launched until the end of the decade, depending on Space X’s schedule.

Mr Musk’s involvement in the long-term is not certain and WorldVu risks losing its spectrum in 2030 too.

The company currently controls a  block of radio spectrum in the Ku band, communicating in the microwave range of between 12 and 18 GHz.

In June, it was announced that Google is planning on launching a fleet of 180 satellites to provide web access for the 4.8 billion people not yet online.

According to sources close to the company, it plans on spending more than $1 billion (£600 million) on the technology.

Mr Wyler was working at Google on the final design of the satellites, which are thought to be small, high-capacity and intended to orbit the Earth at 'lower altitudes than traditional satellites'. 

Before Mr Wyler left Google, there were reportedly plans to make small, high-capacity satellites designed to orbit the Earth at 'lower altitudes than traditional satellites'. There is also a project in the world to launch giant balloons to connect remote regions to the internet

Google: The internet giant is said to be planning the launch of a fleet of 180 satellites to provide web access for the 4.8 billion people not yet online.

The project was led by Mr Wyler.

Google is tipped to spend $1 billion (£600 million) on the technology and is also planning on using balloons and drones.

Google's Project Loon aims to launch high-altitude balloons to provide broadband service to remote locations below.

The helium-filled balloons are designed to inflate to 49ft (15 metres) in diameter and carry transmitters that could beam 3G-speed internet to remote regions.

In April, the company also acquired Titan Aerospace, which is building solar-powered drones to provide similar connectivity.

Facebook: Mark Zuckerburg revealed solar-powered drones, satellites and lasers are all being developed in the firm's labs to deliver the internet to underdeveloped countries.

Small satellite manufacturers: Sierra Nevada and Britain’s Surrey Satellite Technology are both adept at making increasingly cheap small satellites and have a good track record.

He only stayed for around one year before leaving to work with Mr Musk.

Sources close to him told The WSJ that Mr Wyler’s relationship with Google broke down because he doesn't think Google has the manufacturing experience needed for such a commitment. Google did not comment.

If the ambitious project goes ahead, Mr Musk and Mr Wyler will be competing with established firms such as Sierra Nevada and Britain’s Surrey Satellite Technology.

They will also be going head-to-head with Google and Facebook too.

The helium-filled balloons are designed to inflate to 49ft (15 metres) in diameter and carry transmitters that could beam 3G-speed internet to remote regions.

It's hoped that it could save developing countries the high cost of laying fibre cables to get online and lead to a dramatic increase in internet access for the likes of Africa and south-east Asia.

In April, the company also acquired Titan Aerospace, which is building solar-powered drones to provide similar connectivity.

Facebook, meanwhile, has its own drone plans. In March, Mark Zuckerberg revealed solar-powered drones, satellites and lasers are all being developed in the firm's labs to deliver the internet to underdeveloped countries.

He has pledged to work on technology to deliver the internet to 'the next 3 billion people' - and revealed the firm has hired experts in solar power that can keep drones flying for months at a time.

The Institution of Engineering and Technology's president, Professor William Webb, said: 'The idea of using aerial platforms to deliver connectivity is one that is many decades old, from low-orbital satellites to balloons and more recently unmanned aerial vehicles.'

'The difficulty has always been one of keeping the aerial platform in the right place in the sky for weeks or months at a low enough cost. As technologies mature we get ever closer to achieving this and Facebook's intervention in this space is a welcome boost to the area.'

Companies such as Facebook and Google have a checkered
history with privacy, and many have voiced concerns about how the site could
use drones to collect data about people.

In theory, the drones could be
used to take aerial images, or collect details about wireless networks and
individuals.

As Facebook and Google's drones will be
used to provide internet to people home's, there will need to be a limited
amount of data collection to connect the homes to the network.

With this in mind, they are
likely to be subject to strict regulation.

In the U.S, for example, the
Federal Aviation Authority's (FAA) guidelines state private operators  are
allowed to fly their drones ‘recreationally’ and commercial drones are
'prohibited.'

However, earlier this year Judge Patrick Geraghty, from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)
dismissed a fine, which the FAA had placed on a drone photographer.

Geraghty said Raphael Pirker’s
camera drone was ‘not subject to [federal regulation] and enforcement,’ and
therefore the fine wasn't valid. It is unsure exactly what this
ruling will mean for companies such as Amazon, and now Facebook, but it could
see the restrictions relaxed.

The FAA is appealing. Facebook and Google are also
planning to use these drones in areas outside the U.S., and it will depend on
the individual country's laws on unmanned aircraft and surveillance.

Mr Musk and Mr Wyler both want to cut the cost of the technology, not least because WorldVu needs a lot of satellites.

Mr Musk has an enviable track record of reducing the cost of space travel by simplifying the design of rockets and building components in-house and it is hoped he will help to develop satellites that cost under $1 million (£629,008), instead of several million as they do at the moment.
