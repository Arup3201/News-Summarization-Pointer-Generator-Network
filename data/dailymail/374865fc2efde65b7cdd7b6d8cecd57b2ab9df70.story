The 18-year-old student who propelled herself to stardom for criticising her state governor in a tweet says she is now being bullied by classmates.

Emma Sullivan, of Fairway, Kansas, was scolded by her principal at The Shawnee Mission East High School for criticising Sam Brownback.

Now the teen has revealed she is being 
bullied at school after she went from 60 Twitter followers before 
last week’s incident to more than 15,000.

She has since received an apology from 
Kansas Governor Brownback for his staff’s complaint about her tweet 
during a field trip to the state Capitol.

‘It is just bullying, and I’m trying not to take it to heart because that’s what they want me to do,’ Emma told Politico on Tuesday.

‘I’m getting a lot of negative attention locally and that’s a lot to deal with,’ she said, adding it ‘sucks’ that her fellow students are not supporting her.

Emma said she would not got into school on Tuesday because of the bullying and some Twitter users have been calling her an ‘attention whore’.

The budding photographer’s disgust at the state’s public arts fund being privatised was behind her original tweet about Governor Brownback.

She wants to study psychology and sociology at university and is also planning to campaign for President Barack Obama next year.

Governor Brownback said sorry on Monday for his office's response. ‘My staff overreacted to this tweet and for that I apologise,’ he said.

She was taking part in a Youth in Government programme when she sent out a tweet from the back of a crowd of students listening to his greeting.

From her mobile phone, she wrote: ‘Just made mean comments at gov. brownback and told him he sucked, in person #heblowsalot’.

She said she was just joking with friends - but Governor Brownback's office, which monitors social media, contacted the youth program.

Miss Sullivan said she spent nearly an hour in the principal's office and was told to apologise in writing to Governor Brownback.

The student decided to not write the apology letter and the school district issued a statement on Monday saying there would be no repercussions.

'Saying that the governor is no good and is a blowhard is core protected speech. It's absolutely what the First Amendment was designed to protect'

Doug Bonney, a local American Civil Liberties Union spokesman, said the teen's speech was clearly protected by the First Amendment.

‘Saying that the governor is no good and is a blowhard is core protected speech,’ he said. ‘It's absolutely what the First Amendment was designed to protect.’

She now has more than four times as many Twitter followers as Governor Brownback’s official account, which only has around 3,500.
