A man in Gallatin, Tennessee who became an online sensation for posting videos of his pet racoons, had one of those raccoons taken away by the state.

Mark 'Kuhn Rippy' Brown, a self-described 'hillbilly', became famous after posting a hilarious video dancing with his pet raccoon named Gunshow to Aretha Franklin's 'Chain of Fools' on YouTube, garnering the video over 1million views.

The video has attracted the attention of local news outlets, and Brown recently signed a deal to shoot a reality TV show pilot.Â

Raccoon number two: Rebekah was Brown's second raccoon. His other pet raccoon Gunshow died earlier this year

Brown, a former animal control officer, has posted some 40 videos to YouTube, chronicling his adventures with Gunshow, who sadly passed away earlier this year.

Since his death, Brown and his girlfriend adopted a new baby raccoon named Rebekah and in the latest video Brown is shown showering with the creature.

But his YouTube notoriety may also have been his downfall, since it alerted the authorities that he was keeping a raccoon illegally.

The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency showed up last month and took Rebekah with them.

Now Brown is fighting to get his furry friend back. He's personally petitioned the governor and even made another video asking for contributions to his legal defense.

Brown believes it's his internet stardom that caused the state to target him.

'Now that I have become a big fish, they've come after me to take Rebekah away from me,' he told WKRN-TV.

He questions why they came now, right when he was about to get his own reality show. He says the authorities would have to be 'living under a rock' not to have known about Gunshow.

A TWRA representative told News Channel 5 that it was a neighbor complaint - and not the YouTube videos - that alerted them to the illegal animal

The agency is required to confiscate wild animals if they know someone is keeping them.

For now, Rebekah is living at Walden's Puddle, a wildlife rehabilitation and educational center.

'I ask God every night for two things: either free Rebekah back to me or just let me forget about it. One is a whole lot easier than the other,' Brown said
