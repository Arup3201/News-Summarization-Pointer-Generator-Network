A single market town in the foothills of the Pennines has taken more asylum seekers than the whole of South East England, it has been revealed.

Extraordinary figures show Rochdale, which rose to prominence with its textile mills during the Industrial Revolution, houses 680 refugees – one in 41 of all those in Britain.

Yet the entire south-east region, which covers eight counties plus the Isle of Wight and is amongst the most affluent in the country, has received just 441 asylum seekers.

The market town of Rochdale has taken more asylum seekers than the whole of the South East region

Rochdale is a market town in Greater Manchester with a population of just over 200,000.

It has a much larger proportion of people from a Pakistani background than the rest of the country.

Around 10 per cent of the town is Pakistani British, according to the latest census.

The town is also poorer, with more unemployment and lower house prices than the UK average.

Around 10 per cent of population is out of work – compared to just 6 per cent nationally.

More than 5,000 families in Rochdale have children where neither parent is in work.

The average house price in the town is just over £120,000 – less than half the £270,000 across the UK.

In West Oxfordshire, the local authority which covers Prime Minister David Cameron’s Witney constituency, has failed to take a single person, while Maidenhead, where Home Secretary Theresa May is the MP, has just one.

Now MPs have vowed to raise the issue with the Home Office amid concerns that some towns and cities across Britain have been handed an ‘unfair’ burden.

They say the distribution of asylum seekers is a ‘scandal’ that has put disproportionate strain on schools, health services, housing and other infrastructure in their constituencies.

Rochdale’s Labour MP Simon Danczuk – who has repeatedly urged party leader Ed Miliband to face up to the pressures of immigration faced by communities across the UK – has said in the past his seat, population 211,000, has become a ‘magnet for the dispossessed’.

Mr Danczuk said: ‘I think we can be proud as a country that we offer asylum to people who need it, but we need to make sure the burden is spread fairly across the country. We need to make sure that the system is fair.

‘The system at the moment is a shambles and ministers need to explain why David Cameron’s constituency takes no asylum seekers and a wildly disproportionate number are placed in Rochdale.

‘This is bad policy and runs the risk of not only putting extra strain on community relations but also putting significant pressure on services that are already struggling due to Government cuts.’

Rochdale is home to Gillian Duffy, who famously confronted Gordon Brown during the 2010 election campaign over the numbers of immigrants in the town 

Rochdale is home to Gillian Duffy, who famously confronted Gordon Brown during the 2010 election campaign over the numbers of immigrants in the town. The Labour leader later described her as a 'bigoted woman'. 

Labour MP Paul Flynn, who represents Newport, in south Wales, said the former coal and steel city had 426 asylum seekers.

He said: ‘Many asylum seekers have settled very well and become part of Newport, and the city has been very hospitable. But the differences in the number being sent to different parts of the country is so amazing as to be scandalous.

‘There are serious problems such as the strain on health and education services and problems with people integrating. These tensions are not the fault of the asylum seekers, but the Home Office for housing them disproportionately.

Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk said the town should be proud of the number of people it offers asylum to but stressed the must be 'spread fairly across the country'

‘We have been carrying more than our fair share.’

Mr Flynn is also angry that the Home Office ‘dumped’ a notorious London gang leader in Newport on immigration bail when he had no links to the city.

Home Office figures show there were 27,815 asylum seekers living in Britain at the end of September. Many are fleeing war, humanitarian disasters or political and religious persecution in other parts of the world.

But large numbers turn out to be economic migrants, who arrive in the UK to look for well-paid work compared to their home countries, then tried to claim asylum to win the right to stay here.

London – which is not included in figures for the South East – had 2,692 asylum seekers, ranging from 377 in deprived Newham, east London, to to just eight in leafy Richmond-upon-Thames in south-west London.

Islington, which covers the constituency of ex-Labour frontbencher Emily Thornberry, sacked for apparently sneering at a house draped with St George’s Cross flags and with a white van parked in front, took 30 refugees.

In the North West, there were 6,298 asylum seekers, including 1,418 in Liverpool and 794 in Manchester. The West Midlands had 4,105 asylum seekers, including 1,370 in Birmingham.

Glasgow alone had 2,625, Cardiff 922 and Middleborough 776, with Stockton-on-Tees, just down the road in Teesside, taking in 666.

But in the South East, well-heeled Wokingham, Winchester, Chichester and Mole Valley are among those local authorities without a single asylum seeker.

Sources in Whitehall suggested the high prices of rented property in the South East and lack of available homes in rural areas meant it was more cost-effective to place asylum seekers outside the region. 

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘The United Kingdom has a long and proud history of offering sanctuary to those who genuinely need it.

‘Asylum seekers are housed according to their individual needs and where there is available and appropriate accommodation. Agreements between national government and local authorities are voluntary and have been in place since 2000.

‘We review this regularly, working closely with local authorities to ensure the system is fair for asylum seekers and for tax payers across the country.’
