As deadly clashes between government forces and supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood continued in Egypt Friday, a disturbing video has emerged that appeared to show the military firing on unarmed demonstrators.

The footage clocking in at just under a minute was uploaded to YouTube August 16. The caption written in Arabic read: 'The army shoots on peaceful protesters in Ismailia.'

Ismailia is a city in northeastern Egypt, where Reuters reported that four protesters were killed Friday during a 'Day of Rage.'

Appalling conditions: After they were arrested at a protest in August (pictured), the pair said they were beaten and subjected to degrading treatment in the Egyptian prison

Under fire: About 30 seconds into the video, rapid gunfire erupts, prompting some of the protesters to drop down to a crouch and others to flee

It has not been established if the four deaths confirmed in Ismailia are related to the events depicted in the video.

NBC News foreign correspondent Ayman Mohyeldin tweeted that the news agency Storyful had confirmed the video's authenticity.

A YouTube user by the moniker ahmedkhtr wrote in the comments section, apparently referring to one of the protesters who was allegedly shot in the video: 'He is my friend. His name is Ahmed Hachim one of the best guys ever he is a communication engineer, had a family son&daughter.’

The unsettling clip begins with a group of men numbering more than two dozen marching on four tanks positioned on a city street. 

Defiant: As most people ran away, one man remained standing directly in front of a tank with his arms raised

Gunned down: The demonstrator (seen in background) appears to be struck repeatedly struck by bullets, and then falls down 

Aftermath: The alleged shooting victim is seen rolling over on the ground next to another man

Fact or fiction? NBC News foreign correspondent Ayman Mohyeldin tweeted that the news agency Storyful had confirmed the video's authenticity

The demonstrators appear unarmed, many of them raising or waving their hands in the air. Two of participants are carrying an unfurled banner.

About 30 seconds into the video, rapid gunfire erupts, prompting some of the protesters to drop down to a crouch and others to flee.

As more shots are fired, most of the people abandon the street. One person, however, remains standing directly in front of a tank with his arms raised above his hand.

Just seconds later, the defiant protester wearing blue jeans, a T-shirt and a white hat appears to be struck by a bullet in his leg. He then falls down after apparently being shot again.

A young man in the foreground who witnessed the shooting grimaces and gesticulates in anguish before running away, while the alleged shooting victim is seen rolling over on the ground next to another man.

Pivotal moment: The alleged shooting of the unarmed man was also captured on a cell phone video taken from a different angle

A cell phone video of the alleged shooting, recorded from a different angle by another eyewitness, was also posted to YouTube. That clip shows the protester getting shot directly in front of a tank.

News reports said more than 40 people died in clashes that spread to Alexandria, Ismailia, Damietta, Fayoum and other cities. Egypt's military-backed government said there were 27 confirmed deaths nationwide.

Last night, at least 91 protesters and police were feared dead in Cairo as a ‘Day of Rage’ ended in inevitable bloodshed.

Supporters of ousted president Mohamed Morsi called for fresh demonstrations after more than 600 people were killed when attempts to clear protest camps earlier in the week turned into a massacre.

The fresh violence erupted when tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets after Friday prayers.

Dozens died when security forces opened fire in Ramses Square, the focal point for demonstrators.

Some marchers heading towards the square jumped from road bridges to escape bullets and clouds of tear gas.

Another 25 demonstrators were killed 
outside the capital, according to reports, and security officials said 
24 policemen had died in the fighting.

David Cameron was due to discuss the 
crisis by telephone last night with French President Francois Hollande 
amid urgent calls for EU foreign ministers to meet over the 
deteriorating situation.

It came as British tour operators came
 under increasing pressure to suspend holidays to Egypt as governments 
around Europe started warning their citizens to stay at home.

Residents and protesters: More prominently than during earlier violence, there were street battles between Morsi supporters and vigilante residents rather than police

Companies such as Thomas Cook are 
cancelling holidays booked by German customers – but are still flying 
Britons out to Red Sea resorts such as Sharm el Sheikh because of 
differing advice issued by the two countries.

The Muslim Brotherhood – the party of 
the ousted president – called for a ‘Friday of Anger’ in response to the
 mass killing on Wednesday when security forces cleared protest camps 
set up after last month’s military coup.

Beforehand the military-backed 
government had authorised the use of live ammunition, warning anyone 
attacking the police or official buildings would be dealt with 
‘severely’.

Tanks and armoured vehicles blockaded key routes around 
Cairo and when protesters converged on Ramses Square, police fired tear 
gas and gunshots echoed around the capital.

In a nearby mosque, transformed into a field hospital, one witness counted at least 35 bodies.

Much of the anger was directed at Egypt’s army commander General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.

‘The people want the butcher executed,’ said Mustafa Ibrahim, 37, as he marched with a crowd of several thousand demonstrators.

But the population remains deeply 
divided, with residents helping the army block access to Cairo’s Rabaa 
al-Adawiya mosque, the focal point of Wednesday’s bloodbath when at 
least 638 were killed and thousands injured.

While the capital has seen the worst 
of violence, there are increasing fears it will spread to popular Red 
Sea resorts, just an eight-hour drive from Cairo.

More than 40,000 British holidaymakers are in Egypt, predominantly in these resorts.

Germany’s Foreign Ministry advised Germans not to go anywhere in Egypt, prompting Thomas Cook and Tui to suspend all holidays.

Meanwhile in the UK, both Thomas Cook 
and Thomson, owned by Tui, are continuing to fly out holidaymakers, 
citing current Foreign and Commonwealth Office advice that it remains 
safe to do so.

Thomson said: ‘Should FCO advice change we have contingency plans in place and we will act accordingly.’

Thomas Cook said: ‘Further to our 
FCO’s directive, Thomas Cook UK & Ireland’s booking conditions will 
remain as normal until such a time as their advisory changes.’

Kuoni yesterday began offering UK holidaymakers worried by the violence refunds or a ‘suitable alternative holiday’.
