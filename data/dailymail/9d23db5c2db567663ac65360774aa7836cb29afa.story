Arsenal are hopeful Kieran Gibbs will be available to face Burnley on Saturday after the defender sustained a pelvic injury in the win over Sunderland.

The England international sustained the problem during the closing stages of the victory at the Stadium of Light.

The injury is still being assessed by the Gunners medical team, but the problem is not expected to keep Gibbs out for a prolonged period.

And the defender could even be available for the visit of newly-promoted Burnley on this weekend.

The news will come as a major boost to manager Arsene Wenger, who already has a defensive shortage.

Back-up left back Nacho Monreal is currently filling in as a makeshift central defender in place of the injured Laurent Koscielny, while right-back Mathieu Debuchy is out with an ankle injury.

Captain Mikel Arteta is also expected to be fit for the clash against Sean Dyche's side after picking up a thigh injury against the Black Cats.
