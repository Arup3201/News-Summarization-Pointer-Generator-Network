A bone fragment found in a mass grave could finally reveal what happened to a nine-year-old girl who was kidnapped 24 years ago.

Michaela Garecht vanished in broad daylight outside a corner market in Hayward, California on November 19, 1988.

The bone, which is three inches long, was originally sent with remains to another victim's family but is now undergoing DNA testing.

It was removed from a well in Linden used as a dumping ground by the 'Speed Freak Killers' who went on a 
methamphetamine-fueled killing spree in the 1980s and 90s.

Vanished: Michaela Garecht disappeared when she was nine from outside a store in Hayward, California. Police believe she may have been murdered by the Speed Freak Killers

Digging: San Quentin State Prison deathrow inmate Wesley Shermantine led investigators to four wells, one pictured, where they recovered numerous bones and other items once belonging to his victims

Wesley Shermantine is on death row for four murders - Loren Herzog committed suicide in January-  but there are believed to be more victims.

Earlier this year, Shermantine wrote to a local 
paper saying that Herzog was behind the abduction of Michaela.

On Monday, police told her mother Sharon Murch that they strongly believe the bone belongs to Michaela. It comes from a girl aged five to 13 years old from around the time that the child went missing. A detective revealed to Ms Murch that it is likely Herzog kidnapped her daughter.

Ms Murch told ABC7 this is the most certain police have seemed in two decades of searching for her daughter.

She said: 'I would like to have a 
resolution. If Michaela died then I want to know that. It feels like it 
might actually be the answer.'

Snatched: The nine-year-old went missing from outside a grocery store on November 19, 1988 in downtown Hayward

Dig: Kimberly and Joann's bodies were found during this excavation in northern California

Hayward police are due to make a statement later today after DNA testing on the fragment is complete.

In March, the remains of two 
teenagers, missing since the 1980s, were found among hundreds of bone 
fragments inside an abandoned well linked to the 'Speed Freak Killers'.

Wesley Shermantine and Loren Herzog were childhood friends who embarked on a frenzied killing spree in the 1980s and are believed to be responsible for up to 20 murders. 

Fueled by meth, the two snatched victims for 15 years, many of whom have not been identified, before disposing bodies in remote locations across rural California.

Shermantine is on death row after he was convicted in 2001 of four murders.

Herzog was convicted of three murders and sentenced to 77 years to life in prison. His  sentence was reduced to 14 years after an appeals court tossed out his first-degree murder convictions because his confession had been illegally obtained.

Herzog was paroled in 2010 to a trailer outside the High Desert State Prison in Susanville.

He killed himself in January outside that trailer after learning Shermantine was disclosing more victims' locations.

San Joaquin County Sheriff Steve Moore 
identified Kimberly Billy, who went missing in 1984 at the age of 19, 
and JoAnn Hobson, who disappeared in 1985 at the age of 16. Both were 
from Stockton, California.

Miss Hobson's mother sent her daughter's remains for further testing where it was revealed pieces belonged to up to four other victims - including Michaela.

Michaela Garecht went missing shortly after 10am on November 19, 1988 when she and a friend rode their scooters to a grocery store two blocks from her home.

When they came out of the store, Michaela's scooter had been moved further away in the parking lot, next to a car.

When she went to retrieve it, a white male reportedly jumped out and threw her in the back seat.

The little girl's friend, who was the only witness,  ran to the store for help but the kidnapper managed to escape with the child.

Other families who also have waited in agony for news of missing young women may finally learn what happened to them.

The family of  Ilene Misheloff, who disappeared in January 1989 when she was 13 have also been contacted. 

In February, Shermantine sent authorities on a massive search after he 
agreed to disclose burial locations in exchange for $33,000 from a 
bounty hunter.

Authorities combed a remote Calaveras 
County property once owned by Shermantine's family and excavated an 
abandoned well near Linden.

At the Calaveras County property, 
they found the remains of Cyndi Vanderheiden, 25, who disappeared in 
1998, and Chevelle 'Chevy' Wheeler, 16, who disappeared in 1985.

Meticulous: Department of Justice personnel take a record of the human remains found in the well after Wesley Shermantine, motivated by a bounty hunter's promise to pay, lead investigators to burial sites

Shermantine
was convicted of both murders in 2001, and Herzog reached a plea deal 
for voluntary manslaughter in Vanderheiden's death.

Shermantine,
who blames Herzog for the killing spree, told authorities that ten or 
more bodies could have been stashed at the Linden well.

Searchers dug up
hundreds of bone fragments there, as well as purses, shoes, jewelry and
other evidence dropped inside the 45-feet deep wells.

Dozens of calls have been made to a hotline set up by authorities for people who believe their loved ones might be among the victims of Shermantine and Herzog.

Herzog, 
who was paroled in 2010, committed suicide in January at his trailer, 
hours after being told that Shermantine was cooperating with 
authorities.
