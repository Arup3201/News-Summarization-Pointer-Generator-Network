A California jury recommended the death penalty for Michael Barbar, the man convicted of strangling his wife and beating his six-year-old daughter to death, after learning the girl was not his biological child.

After discovering his wife had been unfaithful the enraged husband handcuffed Maysam Barbar, 43, strangled her with a computer cord and left her lifeless, naked body on her bedroom floor.

Then Barbar, 55, tried to strangle his young daughter, Tamara, but when she fought back, he bashed her head against her bedpost as many as 20 times, until her skull was crushed.

Guilty: Michael Barbar (pictured in June) was convicted of murdering his wife and young daughter after he found out he wasn't the girl's biological father. On Friday, a California jury recommended the death penalty

The couple's other daughter Tarah, 13, 
was asleep in the family's Riverside, California home on the night of 
the killings and testified that she awoke to hear her sister's chilling 
cries and a banging sound.

The next morning, Tarah discovered her sister's bed covered in blood and her mother's room locked.

The gruesome crime on November 14, 
2009 came eight days after the results of a paternity test revealed the 
girl Michael Barbar had raised as his own, was not in fact his flesh and
blood.

Prosecutors said Barbar had discovered 
that his wife had been unfaithful and was having an affair with a man 
who lived in Texas.

He took Tamara out of school for a 
paternity test and when the results showed she was not his, he took 
eight days to plan his bloody revenge.

After
the brutal slayings, police discovered Barbar in New Mexico and believe
he was en route to Texas to kill his wife's lover and flee to 
Lebanon.

Barbar's attorneys said their client admitted he carried out the murders but tried to argue he was consumed with rage and not thinking clearly, thus the crime were not premeditated.

On July 13, a Riverside County 
Superior Court jury convicted Barbar of two counts of first-degree 
murder and special circumstances of lying in wait and committing 
multiple murders.

On Friday, the panel recommended the death penalty for the convicted killer.

A sentencing date was set for November 16.

Capital punishment has been a hotly contested issue in California.

In November,  California voters will vote on a ballot measure that would replace 
capital punishment with life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.

If
the ballot measure passes, it would commute the sentences of more than 
700 inmates on death row to life in prison without possibility of parole
- to become the state's most severe form of criminal punishment.

Thirteen executions have been carried out since California’s reinstated the death penalty in 1978.
