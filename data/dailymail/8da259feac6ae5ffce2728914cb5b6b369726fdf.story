This tension-filled video shows armed police swooping on a car after a hoax 999 call targeted innocent takeaway staff.

It shows two men being detained by police in Knaresborough, near Harrogate, North Yorkshire, this evening.

Officers wielding submachine guns and baton round launchers ordered the men to keep their hands on their head as they surround a beige or silver Vauxhall Vectra. At one point an officer tells a man to drop his keys.

One of the men is ordered to walk towards officers, who stopped a car with four men inside in Knaresborough this evening. It later emerged the men were the subject of a vicious prank

The men, one wearing black, the other in a checked shirt, were then handcuffed and taken into police vehicles. The video shows a number of police vehicles in the street, and police dogs can be heard barking throughout.

A total of four men were in the car, reports the York Press. It has now been revealed that the men were subject to a malicious false emergency call.

A force spokeswoman said: 'The incident in Knaresborough has now been brought to a safe conclusion and police have thanked members of the public and Paragon Pizza for their cooperation and patience.

'The incident began when North Yorkshire Police and a neighbouring police force received information that there was an immediate threat to members of the public at a business premises in Knaresborough.

'Our primary concern was to ensure the safety of members of the public and an immediate response to the incident was put in place.

'Following extensive and swift enquiries following the calls, officers established that the calls were in fact, malicious hoax calls.

'Officers have thanked the staff and owners of Paragon Pizza - who were the target of the hoax call - for their full cooperation during this incident. The incident has caused them considerable distress.

'To date no-one has been arrested, The Major Crime Unit is now conducting an investigation into the incident to bring the person or people responsible for the malicious communications to justice.'

Christine Thompson, who runs the Give It a Whirl shop close to where the incident happened, said: 'Police came down Windsor Lane to Gracious Street. There were nine vehicles including three unmarked ones.

'They stopped a car coming up Briggate and they made four men get out. They searched them and put handcuffs on two then they had six police dogs and policemen with guns. They were here three quarters of an hour.'

Children at a nearby school were told to stay inside as the situation unfolded.

Police called King James’s School in Knaresborough, near Harrogate in North Yorkshire, to ask that around 250 pupils remained in the building while they dealt with an 'incident' in the High Street.

A member of staff, who did not want to be named, told the Press Association: 'We got the call at about 4.55pm. We were told to keep all students we had in school in the building.

'We then got the all-clear, and we were told just to avoid the High Street.'

King James’s School has about 1,800 pupils, but by 6pm just a dozen remained to be picked up by parents following the alert.

Assistant Chief Constable Paul Kennedy said 'This was a very alarming incident for members of the public and we would like to thank the communities of Knaresborough for their patience and cooperation while the police dealt with it.

'This includes the businesses who were affected by the safety cordons and the premises at the centre of the hoax.

'We treat incidents of this nature with the utmost seriousness and can assure members of the public that a full investigation is now underway to establish who is responsible.'
