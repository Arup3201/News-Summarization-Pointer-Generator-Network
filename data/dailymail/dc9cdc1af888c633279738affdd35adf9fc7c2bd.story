A selfless teenager has launched his own campaign to help sick children despite battling a brain tumour and undergoing 11 operations himself.

Tyler Murphy came up with the idea of organising gift boxes for other sick children with life threatening illnesses to raise their spirits while lying in his hospital bed.

The 17-year-old was diagnosed with a brain tumour when he was 12-years-old and has spent much of his time in and out of hospital having undergone surgery 11 times.

Surgeons have removed as much as the tumour as they can but are unable to remove it all.

Luckily, his condition isn't terminal and can be managed.

Now, with the help of his mother Janet Ellis, he has started Tyler's Trust, a not-for-profit organisation.

Tyler, of Barnham, West Sussex said: 'When I was in hospital having radiotherapy I got the other two children who were on the same ward as me and having the same treatment a comic and toy and they really loved it.

'That is what gave me the idea for the gift boxes.

'I want to help children fighting cancer or other diseases to keep going and not give up.

'Even a small present can make a real difference when you are facing months of going in and out of hospital for treatment.'

The boxes, which will cost around £80 and be age appropriate will be filled with various different items for sick children.

His mother, Janet, 46, said: 'As a mum I feel so incredibly proud of him that he was positive and thinking of other people and I wanted to help him make it happen.

'I think something positive has to come out of what Tyler has been through, it's been hard for him and our family.

'We have decided to put our time and effort into fundraising and we have probably managed to get just over £1,500 pounds so far.

'Once we start we don't want to stop, we want to help as many sick children as possible.

'We found it was the little things that made the difference like having your own mug to drink from and having things to do to pass the time.'
