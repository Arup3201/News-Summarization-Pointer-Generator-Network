Nigel Pearson’s default mood is bullish. Troublesome fan? Tell him to **** off and die. Upended in the technical area by a rival player? Grab him by the throat while he lies on the floor.

The enduring image from 24 hours which do not put anyone at Leicester City in a good light will be of their manager bending over Crystal Palace’s James McArthur, his hands round the player’s neck.

Smiling, certainly, a bit of banter, perhaps. Yet it appears the choke has backfired spectacularly.

6.30PM The story breaks that Nigel Pearson has been sacked by Leicester

8.00PM Fans and ex-players react, with Gary Lineker tweeting: ‘Not surprised Pearson has been fired.’

9.45PM After hours of silence from the club, reports begin to leak that Pearson may still be in charge.

10.07PM Leicester finally release a statement saying that Pearson has NOT been sacked...

10.12PM ... but too late to stop ITV News reporting that he has gone.

Leicester’s Thai owners, the Srivaddhanaprabha family, have been a patient lot, backing Pearson earlier in the season and sacking director of football Terry Robinson instead, blaming him for failures in the transfer market last summer.

In January the club went out on a limb and paid a record £9million for Andrej Kramaric, who started on the bench against Palace in what was billed as a must-win game.

That’s a very expensive backside and one can only imagine what Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, who made his fortune through duty free franchises, thought when he bowled up on Saturday.

By the final whistle there were other factors to consider, not least the fact that Leicester, who take on Arsenal away on Tuesday, are in danger of being cast adrift at the bottom of the table.

Then there was that extraordinary moment involving McArthur which started as a laugh and finished with a snarl. Pearson smilingly put his hands round McArthur’s throat while the Palace man lay on the floor after he had accidentally sent Pearson flying in the final minutes of Palace’s win at the King Power Stadium.

Pearson then hauled the player to his feet before grabbing McArthur’s shirt and refusing to release him.

'Leicester City Football Club would like to clarify its position relative to its manager, Nigel Pearson. 

'Contrary to media speculation on Sunday evening, Nigel remains the Club’s First Team Manager. Reports to the contrary are inaccurate and without foundation.

'Nigel, his staff and the first team squad are entirely focused on Tuesday night’s trip to Arsenal and our continued efforts to secure our position in the Barclays Premier League.'

A clearly rattled McArthur pulled away, mouthing ‘Get off me’ and rival manager Alan Pardew came over to see what was happening.

When Pearson said he was only playing around, McArthur is understood to have replied that the stranglehold was hurting his throat.

Afterwards Pearson, who failed in an attempt to sign McArthur from Wigan last summer, only managed to muddy the waters even more.

‘He said something to me,’ said Pearson. ‘I don’t have to reveal anything, do I? I think I’m more than capable of looking after myself.’

The Leicester manager added: ‘I have no problem with the lad. He’s a likeable lad. I’m as disappointed as he was with how things (his transfer) panned out.

‘But it’s the other football club (Wigan) which was involved in it who take absolute responsibility for anything that wasn’t quite right. And a certain manager (then Wigan boss Uwe Rosler), who opened his trap when he should have kept his mouth shut.’

1 - Leicester have won just one of their past nine Premier League home games.

38 - Goals conceded this season — only QPR (43) and Burnley (40) have shipped more. 

3 - Only three teams with 17 points or fewer at this stage in the season have ever escaped relegation from the Premier League — Wigan (11-12), West Brom (04-05) and Fulham (07-08).

21 - Goals scored this season — only Aston Villa (12) have scored fewer. 

16.7 - Leicester’s win percentage this season from 24 matches. 

That has been the Pearson mantra. In private, with a cup of tea and an off-the-record agenda, he is good company but the public persona loves to pick a fight.

On Saturday, he berated a young local reporter for not asking tough enough questions about the failure to start Kramaric, which was somewhat strange, too, as if he was using it as a dress rehearsal for the owners. They stood by him when he got involved with a serial abuser behind the technical area. His argument was that he was defending his staff and he accepted the fine and ban for telling the fan ‘**** off and die’.

He retained the support of his employers, who stuck by him when he missed out on promotion the first time and who expected nothing less than a relegation battle this season, if ultimately a successful one. He also had most of the fans and players on his side. In fact, there was nothing in the body language to suggest anything untoward on Saturday night, although Pearson was not particularly chatty with the media.

Perhaps the owners stayed up to watch Match of the Day on which there were plenty of scratched heads after what happened with McArthur. Presenter Gary Lineker, who  tweeted he wasn’t surprised Pearson had been ‘axed on Sunday’, said of Saturday’s incident: ‘It was a bizarre piece of behaviour. Peculiar circumstances.’

Jermaine Jenas commented: ‘Completely bizarre. It looked a total accident but it’s that point, where he grabs him round the throat, that’s where it changes. The whole reaction in the interview shocked me a little bit. I thought it would be a lot more jovial. You can see McArthur is not happy.’

Danny Murphy added: ‘Maybe there is something underlying about the proposed transfer that did not happen.’

McArthur took to social media, tweeting: ‘Situation with me and Nigel Pearson is getting blown out of proportion.’

On the pitch, Joe Ledley’s headed goal kept Leicester rooted to the bottom of the Premier League.
