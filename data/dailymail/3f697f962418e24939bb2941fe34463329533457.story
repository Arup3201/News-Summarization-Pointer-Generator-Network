Robin
 Roberts has thanked her long-tern girlfriend Amber Laign for helping her overcome two life-threatening illnesses in the space of five years.

The 53-year-old GMA anchor was diagnosed with stage two breast cancer in 2007 and then found out she had a rare blood and bone marrow disease called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in 2012.

She reveals in the April 28 issue of People magazine that it was love that 'saved' her and now she's got her 'mojo back' and feels 'like a walking miracle'.

Big smile: Robin Roberts has told how she feels 'like a walking miracle' after battling two life-threatening illnesses in the space of five years

'I can be sick now like everybody else and it doesn't mean I'm going to land back in the hospital . . . I'm so much stronger now, ' she added.

However, her treatment regime isn't over and she still receives low-intensity chemotherapy shots every six to eight weeks.

This will continue until the second anniversary of her bone marrow transplant - which was part of the treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome - later this year.

Ms Roberts also touched on her ten-year relationship with New York-based massage therapist, Ms Laign, 39, which she only announced in December.

She said she waited to 'come out' in public because she preferred keeping her private life out
 of the spotlight. Her sister, Dorothy, was always aware of her sexuality and she got her mother, Lucimarian's blessing before she passed away in 2012.

Recalling the emotional event, Ms Roberts said: 'She sensed from me that I just needed to know it was okay with her. She said to me, "You are my child, and you're a child of God, and I love you." Right then I didn't care who knew what.'

After such a turbulent few years, Ms Roberts finally felt it was the right time to reveal Ms Laign's identity to her fans.

'Even
 though Amber is someone who shies away from the spotlight, it was 
important for me to let people know I have this person in my life,' she 
told People.

In an interview with Good Housekeeping,
 Ms Roberts addressed fans who criticized her for waiting so long, 
stating: 'Sometimes there's a stigma attached to how people view you if 
you're living a certain way. But I don't care - you gotta live your life
 [sic].'

'Amber, my 
wonderful girlfriend, was the one who insisted 
something wasn't quite right with me'

Ms Roberts made her relationship Ms 
Laign, 39, public on Facebook last December, posting a photo of them 
together with her niece, who had recently married in Baton Rouge, 
Louisiana.

On the front of Good Housekeeping's May issue Ms Roberts looks happy and relaxed more than one year in remission from the life-threatening blood disorder, myelodysplastic syndrome.

In
 an accompanying interview she credits Ms Laign for saving her life as 
she was the one who advised her to visit doctors about a lump on her 
neck.

Providing an excerpt from her upcoming memoir, Everybody's Got Something,
 she recalls: 'At the Oscars in February 2012, I was so bone-tired, I 
could barely focus. Truth be told, I'd noticed a little lump in my neck.

'I
 might not have bothered to have it checked by my doctor if Amber, my 
wonderful girlfriend, hadn't been there - she was the one who insisted 
something wasn't quite right with me.'

Thanks
 to Ms Laign's prompts, Ms Roberts sought medical advice and was 
diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome, a disease in which the bone 
marrow does not make enough healthy blood cells.

Doctors gave her less than two years to live without treatment.

'I believe optimism is a choice - a 
muscle that gets stronger with use. Right foot, left footâ€¦just keep 
moving'

'One
 to two years? 'It couldn't be.' Ms Roberts writes in her new book, recounting the bleak news she received in April 2012.

'Once
 it sunk in, though, I kicked into warrior mode. I leaned forward and 
slapped my fists on [the doctor's] desk and said, "OK. What do we do?"

Ms
 Roberts learned the only possible cure was a bone marrow transplant and
 after several sessions of chemotherapy she underwent the procedure on 
September 20, 2012.

Her older sister, Sally-Ann, acted as the stem cell donor as she proved to be the perfect match.

After a five-month hiatus Ms Roberts made a triumphant return to GMA on 
February 20, 2013, excitedly telling viewers: 'Hi, it's Robin, and I've been 
waiting 174 days to say this: Good morning, America!

'I am so full of gratitude. I share this morning, this day of celebration, with everyone.'

Due to chemotherapy Ms Roberts lost her hair but chose not to wear a wig.

On the front of the new edition of Good Housekeeping she appears with a short naturally-styled crop.

Ms
 Roberts, who also fought and overcame breast cancer in 2007, has been 
vocal about her ordeal and recovery with myelodysplastic syndrome.

'I'm grateful I had the strength to fight. It takes courage to believe the best is yet to come'

She
 hosted a series of reports on ABC News, entitled Robin's Journey, which
 chronicled her struggle with the disease and won a 2013 Peabody Award.

She is also credited with bringing myelodysplastic syndrome into the public eye.

In
 fact, on the day Ms Roberts announced her illness, Be the Match 
Registry, a nonprofit organization for bone marrow donations, reported a
 1,800per cent spike in donors.

Ms
 Roberts, a Pass Christian, Mississippi native, began her career in 
television at ESPN Sportscenter, before joining ABC News in 1995, where 
she co-anchored Good Morning America for seven years.

She surprised fans last December by announcing on Facebook she had been in a ten-year relationship with Ms Laign, who works as a massage therapist in New York.

In her memoir, Ms Roberts touches on the strength the relationship gave her: 'I felt so grateful knowing that whatever was ahead of me, I wouldn't have to go through it alone.'

This
 will be Ms Roberts' second book. Her first, From the Heart: Seven Rules
 to Live By, was published in 2007 and was a New York Times bestseller.

Ms Roberts' memoir, published by Hachette Book Group, will hit shelves on April 22.

She concludes: 'I'm grateful I had the strength to
 fight. It takes courage to believe the best is yet to come, especially 
when you are flat on your back and don't know if you're going to see 
tomorrow.

'I'm no Pollyanna, but I believe optimism is a choice - a 
muscle that gets stronger with use. Right foot, left footâ€¦just keep 
moving.'
