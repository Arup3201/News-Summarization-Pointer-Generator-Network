A teenager has made a remarkable recovery after two life threatening operations to correct her twisted spine.

Natalie Royle, 17, from Grasscroft, Oldham, was diagnosed with scoliosis - curvature of the spine - and the condition gradually worsened over a 12-month period until her spine was bent at a 100-degree angle.

At her worst point, Natalie's internal organs were becoming so compressed that she had breathing problems.

Thanks to surgeons at Manchester Children's Hospital, she has made an incredible recovery.

Natalie Royle, 17, has scoliosis which was so severe that her organs were being crushed. She is pictured with her mother Michelle Royle and her uncle Mike Carr

She underwent two spinal fusion operations at Manchester Children's Hospital during which rods were inserted into her back to straighten her spine

Now she has been told she can get back to exercising, rock climbing and even bungee jumping.

Her grateful family has raised £6,000 for a new scanner for the hospital's spinal unit to say thank you to the staff for saving Natalie's life.

Her mother, Michelle, first noticed something was wrong when Natalie returned from a Duke of Edinburgh expedition in which she had to carry a heavy rucksack for days.

She said: ‘Natalie's right shoulder was sticking out and it wasn't right. I decided to take her to casualty, where she was diagnosed with scoliosis.

‘The curve in her spine became so severe that she couldn't walk for more than five minutes as she was in too much pain.

‘We were told she would have to have surgery, which carried a risk of death, paralysis and blindness.’

After two spinal fusion operations at the Manchester Children's Hospital in 2011 - in which Natalie's spine was opened up, stretched and had rods inserted - she gradually got better.

Now she is relatively pain-free, able
to walk, carry out normal activities and while she still has the 
condition, her spine is almost straight so she should not suffer any 
long-term problems.

Michelle Royle said: ‘The whole thing has been a challenge and a real rollercoaster ride - with more downs on it than ups.

‘What I have learnt through this journey is that Natalie is the bravest, toughest, beautiful, dignified, polite young lady.

‘All who have cared for her have been impressed by how she has dealt with it and I am proud beyond words.

‘She missed a full term of school and she still got As in her exams.

‘Now Natalie has been told she can get back to exercise, rock climbing and bungee jumping - the wonders of modern medicine and surgery.’
