Tories have despaired at Cameron's conduct over Leveson after he forged a late-night press regulation policy at Ed Miliband's office

It was meant to be the week when the Tories’ Election campaign began. The Budget was designed to arm every Tory MP with a message for the doorstep.

But instead this became the week where David Cameron landed himself with a problem that will bedevil him all the way to polling day.

The problem is a system of press regulation that has alarmed nearly every newspaper in the land and infuriated several Tory Secretaries of State.

Compounding this problem is that this wasn’t a deal made in Downing Street, but in Ed Miliband’s office.

One despairing Cabinet Minister says when he woke up and heard what had happened, he put his pillow over his head and considered resigning.

It is little wonder then that Lynton Crosby, the man Cameron hired to deliver a Tory victory at the next Election, is so concerned by events.

A friend remarks ruefully: ‘Lynton told them to sort minimum alcohol pricing and Leveson as they were both distractions from the main message. But this certainly isn’t what he had in mind on Leveson.’

This was a U-turn with added political incompetence – for ten days previously, Cameron had called off cross-party talks saying the distance between the parties was unbridgeable.

Even one of his longest-standing allies admits the deal was ‘terrible and ridiculous’. One No 10 aide defends the agreement but concedes: ‘No one was thinking through how it looks.’

Labour's negotiators are incredulous at how the Tories handled things – allowing Oliver Letwin to be summoned from his bed to late-night talks and to arrive without any political support. One says: ‘We couldn’t believe they hadn’t created a  better, stronger team. They were so apolitical about it.’

The fact the mild-mannered, consensual Letwin was doing this job at all reveals how politically naive No 10 can be. One Secretary of State points out that ‘when you’re in a knife fight with Miliband on the issue he’s used to define himself, it is risky to send in a healer not a warrior’.

This week’s events have led to a growing feeling in Tory circles that Crosby, the man who led Boris Johnson to victory twice in London, needs to go full-time.

If he doesn’t, political mistakes will keep on happening – making his job and a General Election victory impossible.

One Minister who knows the Cameron operation well insists that Crosby ‘won’t be able to do what he needs to do unless he’s around every day’.

Crosby is already proving hugely influential.

One Osborne ally tells me ‘to say that this was Lynton’s Budget as much as George’s Budget is an exaggeration. But there’s some truth to it.’

So far, he has fitted into the team better than expected.

Many thought the straight-talking Australian’s style wouldn’t suit the more genteel Cameron circle.

But even Andrew Cooper, Cameron’s chief strategist, who was expected to clash spectacularly with Crosby, is getting on with him.

The unpolitical nature of No 10 has long been a source of irritation to Tory Cabinet Ministers.

At a political Cabinet meeting last year, several Ministers complained forcefully to Cameron about it.

There are signs that their message is starting to get through. Oliver Dowden, the recently appointed deputy chief of staff, is proving adept at pushing Tory changes through the Whitehall machine.

And Ameet Gill, who has been with Cameron since he became leader, has now been put in charge of the Government’s daily agenda, bringing a sense of energy and discipline to it.

Acknowledging that there’s a problem, Cameron has taken to telling people he wants the Government’s message to be ‘cleaner and clearer’.

But if the Tories are to be in with a fighting chance at the Election, they’ll need to realise they’re in a political battle now.

The Budget showed that when they remember that, they are competitive. But last week revealed what disasters happen when they fail to grasp this.

Cyprus is in the middle of the longest 
bank holiday in history and, when banks do reopen, there will be strict 
limits on how much money people can take out.

But the UK Government 
believes the island isn’t going to end up being the first to quit the 
single currency.

One senior figure says: ‘Angela Merkel is playing 
hardball but she doesn’t want the economic danger of Cyprus leaving the 
euro.’

But one Minister concedes that the situation is moving so fast it
is hard to know what will happen next, especially given that Germany 
was reluctant to see Cyprus even join the EU in 2004.

If the Cypriots do
leave, it’ll be the cheapest place in Europe to holiday this summer.

David Cameron will head north of the border in the coming weeks as the Government continues to plot how to beat Alex Salmond in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum.

Salmond, for his part, is missing no opportunity to get under the  skin of Cabinet Ministers, by signing off letters to them: ‘Yours for  an independent Scotland.’

But Patrick McLoughlin, the no-nonsense Transport Secretary, has come up with a simple response. He finishes his own correspondence to Salmond: ‘Yours for a United Kingdom.’

Former BBC producer Thea Rogers is said to be behind the Budget's slick presentation and improving Osborne's media performances

The night before the Budget, George 
Osborne and his Treasury team sat eating takeaway Domino’s pizza as they
went through the details one last time.

There was a certain 
nervousness. They knew Osborne couldn’t afford for this Budget to 
unravel as the last one had.

Today, it is clear it hasn’t. Much of the damage done to the 
Chancellor’s reputation on the Tory backbenches by last year’s events 
has been repaired.

Osborne’s political capital and confidence are also 
returning.

As one Cabinet ally proclaims: ‘We’ve got the full George 
back.’

Osborne has done much to try to avoid a repeat of last year’s problems.

He’s strengthened his ministerial team, bringing in Greg Clark, one of 
the cleverest Tories in Parliament, and Sajid Javid, a former banker and
one of the stars of the new Tory intake.

He’s also bolstered his office
with two new advisers. Neil O’Brien, former head of think-tank Policy 
Exchange, is responsible for the Chancellor’s refrain that the 
Government is for ‘people who work hard and want to get on’.

The other 
arrival is former BBC producer Thea Rogers, left, who worked with the 
Corporation’s Political Editor Nick Robinson. Insiders credit her with 
the slick presentation of the Budget and improving Osborne’s media 
performances.

But the real challenge for Osborne and his team will come with the 
spending review in June, which must set out a further £11.5 billion of 
cuts.

It is hard to see how the numbers can be made to add up, given 
there will be no further savings from welfare, and the Lib Dems are 
determined to protect the budget of Vince Cable’s Business Department, 
which they believe to be key to growth.

This means the only option appears to be big cuts in the Tory-run Home 
Office and Defence.

This won’t go down well with their Ministers, who 
have already spoken out against more cuts.

One Treasury source concedes the spending review will ‘get noisy’ but is
adamant they ‘will get it done’.

If Osborne can manage to square this 
circle, his political authority really will be restored.
