A bride-to-be faced a race against time after competing in a 5k race leaving her with just one hour to get ready for her wedding.

Helen Critchley, 30, form Bolton, finished the run in 25 minutes when the countdown for her wedding to Brett Bury, 36, began.

Sporty Helen runs in the Bolton Parkrun Race at Leverhulme Park every Saturday and despite it being her big day she was still determined to take part - and even asked her wedding guests to join in.

She said: 'I run the race every Saturday and I didn't see why I should make any exception just because it was my wedding day.

'When I told my family I was doing it they all shook their heads and said I couldn't possibly do it and wouldn't end up going through with it.

'I think that made the challenge even more appealing though and luckily I was only a couple of minutes late to the altar.

'Some of my friends and family ran with me and I made them wear tutus as a bit of fun.'

The couple, who have been together for 13 years, were wed at Mere Hall Register Office after Helen changed out of her trainers and had a rapid makeover.

After the ceremony, the celebrations were held in a festival-themed reception at their home with their two sons, Cole, seven, and Nathan, six, present.

Helen, who works as an assistant credit control manager, said: 'Every year around this time we hold our own take on Glastonbury to tie in with my birthday which we call "Gardenbury".

'So this year, with it being my 30th and the wedding, everybody had to come.

'It was brilliant and it even stopped raining just in time for my guests arriving so it was really perfect.'

Fitness-fanatic Helen has new sporty goals now that she's married.

She has signed up to the Chester Marathon in October and will take part in the extreme 12 mile obstacle course Tough Mudder in September.
