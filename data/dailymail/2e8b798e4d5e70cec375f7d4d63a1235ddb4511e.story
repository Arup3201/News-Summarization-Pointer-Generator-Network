If you think parking your car is getting harder, you’re right – and it’s probably not your fault.

While parking spaces have stayed the same size for 20 years, cars have widened by around 16 per cent – making the average modern model two inches broader than the legal minimum space.

And the squeeze is costing motorists an annual £500million in repairs to their paintwork.

The size of the average car has grown as manufacturers strive to offer more interior space, comfort and often mandatory crash protection

As car park owners fit in as many minimum-size spaces as they can, more than ten million drivers a year are scuffing or scratching their cars.

Two thirds then have to pay more than £50 in repairs, a study from Halfords and paint-renovation experts G3 Pro has found.

Car doors are the most likely part to be scraped, accounting for half of all reported damage. They are followed by bumpers (14 per cent) and wing mirrors (13 per cent).

Yet Transport Department rules on the minimum size of parking spaces – at 5ft 11in (1.80m) – have not changed since 1994 and local council guidelines on off-street parking go back to the 1980s.

Meanwhile, car manufacturers are trying to offer more interior space and comfort to drivers who are simultaneously getting taller and fatter.

Manufacturers have also needed more space to comply with EU safety standards.

They say this entails changing the shape of the bonnet and the panels to create a crumple-zone as well as reinforcing the superstructure and adding more weight.

Some popular models have increased in width by as much as a quarter over the past 25 years.

The latest generation of the popular compact BMW 3 series – at just over 5ft 11 wide with its wing-mirrors folded – is wider than the minimum parking space and eight inches broader than the 1975 original.

A BMW spokesman said: 'The original 3 series of the 1970s and 80s is about the same size as today’s smaller 1 series.'

The newest Volkswagen Golf – at 1799mm (5ft 11) – is now only a single millimetre narrower than the official minimum space, while the 1974 original had a width of around 5ft 2in (1587mm) and so had more than eight inches to spare.

Even the latest compact Ford Focus – at around 6ft 1in with its wing-mirrors folded – is more than two inches wider than the official minimum.

When it comes to a parking squeeze, experts say supermarkets were reported as the worst offenders followed by shopping centres

Critics say local authorities are making the spaces as tight as they are legally able and that the squeeze is causing strains and back injuries to motorists struggling to get out of tight and cramped spaces.

The Halfords research found supermarkets were regarded as the worst offenders, with 38 per cent of drivers saying the spaces were too small, followed by shopping centres (29 per cent) and railway stations (18 per cent).

Halfords paint protection expert David Howells said: ‘The majority of drivers blamed their scratches on inconsiderate drivers parking too close to them, but our research shows that the size of parking spaces is leaving them little choice.'

Donna Howard from G3 Pro said: 'Even the smallest scratch can be very annoying and reduce the value of a vehicle by hundreds of pounds.

'But with car park operators looking to maximise visitor volumes and revenue, there is little incentive for them to exceed the recommended minimum size requirements.'

A spokesman for car manufacturers said that although cars had increased in size, parking sensors and power steering meant they were easier to manoeuvre into narrow spaces.
