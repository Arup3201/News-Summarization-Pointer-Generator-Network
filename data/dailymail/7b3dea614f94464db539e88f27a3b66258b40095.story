The SNP are on course for a landslide general election victory in Scotland which will stop Ed Miliband becoming Prime Minister, pollsters have claimed.

Labour are trailing the Scottish nationalists by 17 points – with support for the SNP remaining steady at 45 per cent, a new survey has revealed.

In a further blow for Labour, Scots now prefer David Cameron as Prime Minister to Mr Miliband - despite only 15 per cent of voters north of the border backing the Tories.

The SNP are on course for a landslide general election victory in Scotland in the general election this May

If northing changes by May 7, the SNP will take 21 seats off Labour and nine off the Liberal Democrats, leaving Mr Miliband short of a majority in the Commons.

The SNP would be left with 47 seats to Labour's 10. The Lib Dems would lose all but two of their 11 Scots MPs and the Tories would keep their solitary Scottish MP.

Election experts have warned that the collapse in Labour's vote in Scotland could even undermine Mr Miliband's chances of forming a Coalition government with either the SNP or Lib Dems.

The poll of 1,011 Scots was carried out by research consultants Survation for the Daily Record newspaper.

Polling guru Professor John Curtice said: 'Given the state of the GB polls, those losses could make the difference between Ed Miliband being in sight of a workable majority and being quite a way off.'

He said, as things stands, Labour will finish 31 seats short of a working majority - with 290 Westminster seats.

Even a coaltion with the Lib Dems – who are expected to finish with just 24 seats - would leave a Labour/Lib Dem coalition seven seats short

But Labour's warning that voting SNP will hand the keys to Downing Street to David Cameron could backfire – after research showed Scots preferred the Tory leader as Prime Minister to Mr Miliband.

Despite the unpopularity of the Tories, Scots would rather have Mr Cameron in the top job than Mr Miliband.

Nineteen per cent think Miliband would make the best Prime Minister, compared to 23 per cent for Cameron, six per cent for UKIP's Nigel Farage and five per cent for Nick Clegg.

David Cameron could be kept in power by the SNP's surge

Even among Labour supporters, only 46 per cent think Miliband would be the best PM.

Labour has accused Mr Cameron of being 'secretly pleased' by the prospect of Scots opting for the SNP at the general election because it remains his 'best chance' of staying in power, according to shadow Scottish secretary Margaret Curran.

The Labour politician has predicted that the Prime Minister will 'talk up' the nationalists and 'talk down' her party when he addresses the Scottish Conservative conference later this week.

Recent polling suggests the SNP will almost completely wipe out Labour in Scotland in May's vote.

Ms Curran admitted voters have told the party it has 'not been good enough' and must 'fight its corner better', but she insisted its message is 'beginning to resonate on doorsteps'.

Labour has refused to be drawn on the prospect of a coalition or 'confidence and supply' arrangement with the SNP in the event of a hung parliament.

The party has been keen to focus on the consequences of the loss of Labour support north of the border.

Speaking ahead of the Tories' Scottish conference, Ms Curran said: 'The choice is absolutely clear. A choice between a Tory government that will carry on looking after their friends with Swiss bank accounts, or a Labour government that is going to clamp down on tax avoidance from day one.

'We now have a Tory Party with spending plans from the Great Depression and welfare policies from the Victorian workhouse. Scotland absolutely cannot go on like this.

'That is why David Cameron is going to get a very cold reception when he comes to Scotland in the next couple of days.

'Scotland does not want five more years of the Tories.'

Ms Curran said an appearance by the Prime Minister at the conference would be 'an important moment in the campaign'.

'He'll actually try to talk down Labour and he'll try to talk up the SNP,' she said.

'We know that David Cameron is actually secretly pleased at the prospect of Scottish people voting SNP because he knows that is his best chance of staying in power.

'We know for sure that every vote for the SNP is a boost for David Cameron and makes it more likely that he will end up in Downing Street for another five years.'

But addressing the issue of the SNP's potential gains in May, Mr Cameron reportedly said the idea with the nationalists linked up with Labour would be 'very worrying'.

He told the BBC: 'In Scotland, a lot of people vote SNP, they will definitely ally with Labour, and I think it is very worrying that you could have a Labour government propped up by a party that actually want to abolish our country.'
