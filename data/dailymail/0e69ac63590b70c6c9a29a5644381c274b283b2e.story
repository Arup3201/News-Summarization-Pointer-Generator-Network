The latest stars eager to take the Los Angeles Clippers off the hands of disgraced owner Donald Sterling are reportedly unlikely duo Floyd Mayweather Jr and Justin Bieber.

According to Melanie Collins, a sports reporter for Yahoo, the pair are planning to join forces, along with Magic Johnson, to buy the team.

'Just spoke to Mayweather, he told me he put in a call to Magic [Johnson] and had Justin over last night to discuss joint Clippers ownership,' reads a tweet she posted Friday.

There's definitely some truth to the speculation - Bieber and Mayweather were together last night as evidenced by photo and video posted to Instagram of the pop star and the boxer enjoying his 'n' his pedicures.

In the video Mayweather says: 'Pedicure, massage - we make it do what it do.'

The 20-year-old singer is apparently helping the undefeated boxer prepare for his bout with Marcos Maidana on Saturday.

Mayweather, 37, wrote on Instagram: '#moneyteam spa. Gettin ready for the fight.'

The pair struck up their unlikely friendship last year, with the singer flying out to Las Vegas to see the fighter take on Canelo Alvarez in September.

Is the next step NBA team ownership?

Embattled: Stars are lining up to take the Clippers of the hands of disgraced owner Donald Sterling

American talk show host Oprah Winfrey has also added her name to the list of stars looking to buy the Los Angeles Clippers.

After
 Clippers owner Donald Sterling was banned for life by NBA commissioner 
Adam Silver, a number of people have expressed an interest in the 
franchise including Oscar De La Hoya and Magic 
Johnson.

But now Oprah has joined David Geffen and Larry Ellison and formed a consortium to take over the NBA team.

The three billionaires have a combined wealth of $60 billion (£35.54b).

Television
 entrepreneur Winfrey, is joining forces with the world's fifth richest 
man, Ellison and entertainment mogul Geffen to pry the franchise from 
Sterling's grip - after he revealed he would not sell the team he bought
 for $12 million (£7.1m) in 1982.

Mayweather, meanwhile, wants to put the $40 million which is his guaranteed minimum for Saturday night’s fight towards cost to purchase the Clippers.

However, despite the celebrity 
billionaire interest, Sterling is refusing to sell his team - 
signaling a lengthy and costly legal battle with the NBA.

NBA commissioner Silver has told Sterling that he wants him to sell the Clippers as part of the extreme sanctions brought against the owner in response to racist comments he was recorded making by a former girlfriend.

'I fully expect to get the support I need from the other NBA owners to remove him,' Silver said.

The NBA on Tuesday banned Sterling from the game for life and fined him $2.5 million for racist comments that drew a storm of outrage from players, fans and commercial sponsors.
