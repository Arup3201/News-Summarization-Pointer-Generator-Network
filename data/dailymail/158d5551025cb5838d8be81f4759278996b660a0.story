Manuel Pellegrini has claimed that Manchester City’s players would never surround the referee in the way Chelsea harangued Dutch official Bjorn Kuipers during their Champions League exit to Paris Saint-Germain.

Jose Mourinho’s side were fiercely criticised for urging Kuipers to send off PSG star Zlatan Ibrahimovic on Wednesday, and Pellegrini warned there must be a limit to what teams will do to achieve victory.

‘You will never see the City players surround the referee,’ said Pellegrini. ‘Maybe you can discuss with the referee about a decision but just one moment in the game. Every time the referee has a decision you have all the players on top of him and it’s impossible for the referee to work.

‘I think all the managers prepare their players to win, but there are different ways to win. You must analyse which is the correct way. They always try to pressure the referee in every decision, so the referee always has problems.’

The Premier League champions are in danger of surrendering their title to Chelsea. And Pellegrini’s position will come under more scrutiny if City go out of the Champions League at Barcelona on Wednesday.

Manuel Pellegrini claims that he would like to extend his contract at the Etihad despite interest from Napoli

Napoli boss Rafael Benitez is yet to be offered a new contract with the Italian Serie A side 

His agent, Jesus Martinez, has suggested that the 61-year-old Chilean could take over from Rafael Benitez at Napoli this summer, but Pellegrini claimed that he would like to extend his contract at the Etihad. 

He said: ‘I have a contract here until June 2016 and I will stay. If I can extend it I will. When I sign a contract I always try to finish it.’

Pellegrini must decide whether to reinstate captain Vincent Kompany at Burnley today after dropping the defender for last week’s win at home to Leicester City.
