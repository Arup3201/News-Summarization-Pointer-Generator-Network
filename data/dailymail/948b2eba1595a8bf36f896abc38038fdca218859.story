When Jonathan Kokontis, 25, and his girlfriend were arrested, he told her in the back of the patrol car that he would be going to jail for a long time.

Melissa Schneider, 27, started crying at the thought, so he knew there was only one, desperate option - an escape.

A bizarre 30-minute video released by the sheriff's department in Seminole County, Florida, shows how the pair then tried to figure out the best ways to get out of the vehicle.

Kokontis, who was picked up by officers after breaking into a home armed with a pickaxe, first told his girlfriend to try and reach through the bars and open the door. He then got her to take off an ear ring which he then used in a failed attempt to unlock his handcuffs.

Caught: Jonathan Kokontis, 25, told his girlfriend Melissa Schneider, 27 that he would be going to prison for a long time minutes after they were arrested and put in a patrol car in Seminole County, Florida

Emotional: She leans her head into his chest and starts to cry, prompting Kokontis to consider the best way to get out of the car 

Their efforts that were shown on WESH are however thwarted by the deputy, who asks Kokontis why he has the ear ring, to which Schneider replies: 'It fell off when he was hugging me.' 

The officer then tells Kokontis to put his hands in front of him. But the felon conjured up one more plan to flee, and asked the deputy to loosen his cuffs.

Kokontis then got up from his chair and pushed passed him, leaving the officers running after him. However it only took minutes for the cops to track him down and put him back in the vehicle. 

He was snared by cops after he allegedly broke into a home armed with a pickaxe. He was then brought down by a K-9 unit. Schneider was arrested for drug possession and aiding a felon and drug possession.

Minutes after being put in the car, Kokontis tell his girlfriend: 'They say it's going to be a burglary of an occupied dwelling' implying that he is likely to receive a long sentence.

Escape bid: His first idea is for her to try and reach through the bars in the window and open the door lever. But she says she can't do it

Plan B: Kokontis then takes his girlfriend's earring and tries - and fails - to pick the lock on his handcuffs. To hid the jewelry he puts it in his mouth, but then spits it back out 

Thwarted: The deputy then opens the door and asks about the earring. He believes Schneider's excuse 

She then leans her head on his chest and starts to cry, screaming: 'Oh my baby.'  

He then asks her: 'If you can reach your hand through one of those bars you can grab the outside lever and you can open the door. Let me see how far your hands slide up.' 

Twisting and turning in her seat, Schneider tells him she can't. However Kokontis manages to get his arms under his feet and in front of him.

He then takes her earring and tries to pick the lock, but fails, so he puts it in his mouth in order to hide it.

The deputy then opens the door and asks the pair about the earring. He believes Schneider's excuse.

Kokontis then shuffles to the door of the car and holds out his hands, asking the deputy to loosen his handcuffs.

Then, in a final bid for freedom, he pushes past the officer and runs away. He was picked up a short time later and put back into the car.  

Desperation: Kokontis then leans out of the door and asks the officer to loosen his cuffs after all other attempts have failed 

Push: The felon, in one last bid for freedom, runs past the officer and briefly escapes custody. He was returned to the vehicle a short time later 

Snared: Kokontis (left) was arrested after he broke into a home with a pickaxe and Schneider was placed in custody for drug possession and aiding a felon
