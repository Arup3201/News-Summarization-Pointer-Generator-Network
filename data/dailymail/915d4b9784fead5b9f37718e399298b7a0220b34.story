With the largest wildfire in Washington state’s history now 52 percent contained, aerial shots have emerged showing the true extent of the devastation caused the fires which have been raging for over a week.

The Carlton Complex of fires has burned nearly 400 square miles in the north-central part of the state and destroyed 150 homes. It has also been blamed for one death after a man died of a heart attack while hauling water and digging a fire line to protect his home.

Homes destroyed by wildfires in Pateros, Washington: The biggest wildfire in the state's history remains at 52 percent contained on Thursday but the weather forecast calls for hot and dry conditions to return over the next few days

The Carlton Complex of fires now stands at more than 250,000 acres, or nearly 400 square miles, and it's being fought by about 2,500 people.

Remains of buildings burned by wildfires lies across the road from the Alta Lake Golf Course near Pateros, Wash.

Thunderstorms on Wednesday dumped hail and heavy rain on the region and helped firefighters battling the blaze

The storm raised humidity in the area of the fire and prevented it from growing much, fire spokeswoman Kris Erikson said.

Officials were concerned that lightning could spark new fires in the parched region, and that the precipitation could lead to flash floods because so much ground vegetation has been lost. 

Due to the intense thunderstorm activity, all firefighters in the Carlton Zone (north) were pulled off the line for safety reasons.

In the end, the change in weather conditions helped dramatically raise the percent of the fire contained from 16 to 52 percent.

It now stands at more than 250,000 acres, or nearly 400 square miles, and it's being fought by about 2,500 people.  

A building and vehicles destroyed by wildfire: President Obama signed an emergency declaration on Wednesday for the state

Unfortunately the weather forecast calls for hot and dry conditions to return over the next few days.

Speaking at a fundraiser Tuesday in Seattle, President Barack Obama said the wildfire, along with other western blazes, can be attributed to climate change.

‘A lot of it has to do with drought, a lot of it has to do with changing precipitation patterns, and a lot of that has to do with climate change,’ the president said.

Obama signed an emergency declaration on Wednesday because of wildfires burning the past two weeks in the state.

The declaration authorizes the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security to 
coordinate disaster relief and help state and local agencies with 
equipment and resources.

At more than 250,000 acres, the Carlton Complex is larger than the 1902 Yacolt Burn, which consumed 238,920 acres in southwestern Washington and was the state's largest recorded forest fire, according to HistoryLink.org, an online resource of Washington state history.

The fire 
is being blamed for one death. Rob Koczewski, 67, died of an apparent 
heart attack Saturday while he and his wife were hauling water and 
digging fire lines near their home. Gov. Jay Inslee said Obama called 
Koczewski's wife to express his condolences.

More
 than 2,100 firefighters and support crew are involved with fighting the
 fire, Payne said. She said firefighters have had success with fire 
lines on the east side of state Highway 153 between Carlton and Twisp.

Karina Shagren, spokeswoman for the state's Military Department, said the National Guard has already been offering aerial support, but 100 National Guard troops were now being used on the ground for firefighting, and additional troops were receiving firefighting training for potential future use.

Inslee briefed Obama on the fire situation after the president arrived in Seattle on Tuesday afternoon at the start of a three-day West Coast trip.

'We have real significant challenges,' Inslee said. 'To have the president here today is actually a stroke of luck.'

Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell were among a dozen U.S. senators who sent a letter to Senate leaders Tuesday asking for passage of emergency legislation to allocate $615 million to fight wildfires.

Fires are burning in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Utah, Arizona and California, and both Oregon and Washington have declared states of emergency.
