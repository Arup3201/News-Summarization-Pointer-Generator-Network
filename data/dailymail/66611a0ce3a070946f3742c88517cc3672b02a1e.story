The '25 O' plate is sought-after as it is ideal for some of the most valuable classic cars ever built

A classic car dealer gave the treasury a welcome boost yesterday by forking out record-breaking £650,000 on two registration plates.

John Collins paid a staggering £518,480 for '25 O' and a further £130,000 for '250 L' at the DVLA auction.

The '250 L' plate is likely to go on his 1964 Ferrari 250 Lusso which is currently on the market for £2.25 million.

But it is the '25 O' plate which will be most sought-after as it is ideal for some of the most valuable models of classic cars ever built.

This includes the £10 million Ferrari 250 GT SWB, £20 million Ferrari 250 TR and £35 million Ferrari 250 GTO.

Bidding on '25 O' started at £50,000 and soon shot up to £75,000 as wealthy businessmen and collectors battled it out.

It soon exceeded £250,000, then £270,000, and £300,000 and with auctioneer Dave Hawes eventually smashing the hammer down at £400,000.

When VAT and buyer's premium is added, the final cost for the plate was a whopping £518,480.

This is thought to be a British record for a registration plate bought publicly with the auction room stunned at the result.

Mr Collins will be putting the plate on an ultra-special, 1961 Ferrari 250 SWB.

The plates were auctioned off in Glamorgan on Thursday for the DVLA and, despite their desirability, were offered with incredibly low reserves.

It was the second of a three day sale with more than £1.3 million spent on Wednesday.

All of the hammer price and the tax on the buyer's premium goes to the treasury while the buyer's premium goes to the firm with the contract for DVLA auctions.

Mr Collins, who runs Talacrest, in Ascot, was involved in a fierce bidding war for the two plates with interested parties bidding over the phone, online and in the showroom.

The most expensive number plate ever sold by DVLA was 1 D which sold for £352,411 in 2009.
