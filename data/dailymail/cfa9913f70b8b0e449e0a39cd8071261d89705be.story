The red half of Manchester went wild last night as United secured their 20th league title.

After a convincing 3-0 win over Aston Villa,  Rio Ferdinand led celebrations in the 
dressing room at Old Trafford as the team enjoyed the end of
yet another stellar Premier League campaign.

Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, 71, also swigged from a bottle of fizz and cheered wildly with his players, pledging to carry on in the job for another decade.

Meanwhile on the streets fans also enjoyed a drink in the city's pubs and bars as they toasted the Red Devils' success, and were later joined by the players who stayed out until after dawn.

After the match Rio Ferdinand tweeted jubilant pictures from the dressing room, sprayed his friends with champagne and jumped for joy. 

Captain on the night Patrice Evra celebrated Manchester 
United's title in a different way by biting into a fake 
arm, the day after his nemesis Luis Suarez sank his teeth into Chelsea defender Branislav
Ivanovic.

Pictures showed Evra 
brandished a fake arm, which was thrown onto the pitch from the stands, 
in what appeared to be an attempt to mock Liverpool's striker.

The pair have previous, though. Suarez was handed an eight-match ban after being found guilty of racially abusing the Frenchman during a match at Anfield in October 2011.

After the match several players joined fans for 
some fun in the city centre, with the team arriving in town around an hour and a half after
the full time whistle blew at Old Trafford. 

After some drinks at various bars they headed for a lock-in before going to a casino at dawn.

The 3-0 win at Old Trafford would wrestle back the Premier League crown from their rivals Manchester City.

Robin
van Persie bagged a magnificent first-half hat-trick to fire Manchester
United to Barclays Premier League title glory, taking just 81 seconds 
to sweep home Ryan Giggs' knock-back.

Twelve
minutes from the break he profited from more unselfishness from the 
veteran Welshman to complete the second three-timer of his United 
career.

In between he 
scored one of the best goals of the entire campaign as he followed Wayne
Rooney's long ball throughout its 50-yard flight, waited for it to fall
out of the sky then smashed a first-time volley into the corner.

It gave them an unassailable 16-point lead over rivals Manchester City and erased the pain of last season.

Sir Alex later vowed to carry on next season after leading Manchester United to their 13th Barclays Premier League title.

Fergie, who arrived at United in November 1986, has now won a staggering 38 trophies at Old Trafford.

The
United chief, now 71, said: 'Winning the title has knocked ten years 
off me - these tablets are great.' Ferguson went on to claim van 
Persie's second, a volley beyond Brad Guzan after latching on to Wayne 
Rooney's 40 yard pass, was 'goal of the century.

The United chief added: 'Never mind goal of the season, it could be goal of the century.

'He did something similar for Arsenal, he's a special talent for sure.

He's
been unbelievable all season. For the first six months he was 
incredible, but he had that little dry spell. This title means a lot to 
him'.

Out with a bang: Robin van Persie's second goal was a joy to behold and set United on course
