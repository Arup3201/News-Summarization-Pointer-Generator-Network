Shinji Kagawa will arrive in Germany on Friday afternoon to put the finishing touches to an £8million return to Borussia Dortmund.

Sportsmail can reveal that a four-year contract has been presented to the out-of-favour Manchester United midfielder and that he was close to reaching agreement on it as he prepared to fly to Dortmund for a medical.

One or two personal details still have to be ironed out but Kagawa is confident they would not prevent him returning to the Westfalenstadion.

Struggle: The 25-year-old failed to impress the three managers he worked for at Old Trafford

Jurgen Klopp repeatedly made it clear Kagawa would be welcomed back with open arms, and the Dortmund boss will get his wish after an unhappy spell at Old Trafford for the attacking midfielder.

He struggled to make his mark after being signed by Sir Alex Ferguson in 2012 for £12million - plus £5million add-ons - and became even more marginalised under David Moyes last season. 

When it became clear chances would continue to be limited under current manager Louis van Gaal, Dortmund seized their chance to lure him back with an offer of €8million up front, with a further two million to follow in add-ons.

Sportsmail revealed last year how Klopp responded to a tearful farewell by Kagawa in the Dortmund dressing room by draping an arm round him and telling him the door was always open, should his United venture not go to plan.

It remained in the forefront of Kagawa's thoughts and made a Dortmund reunion his preferred option, despite interest from Valencia.
