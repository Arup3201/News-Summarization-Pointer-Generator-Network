A German salesman 'sawed, hacked and sliced up' a bank clerk who had suffocated to death in a bizarre sex game gone wrong - before leaving his head 'bobbing in a stewpot'.

Michael Schneider, 45, left 37-year-old Carsten Schmidt's severed head cooking on the stove at his apartment in Berlin, in what police described as a 'horror show'.

After the sordid incident, remains of the victim's body were also found strewn around Schneider's home, wrapped in baking foil and paper.

Michael Schneider, 45, has been jailed for four years after the Berlin regional Court heard he sliced up bank clerk Carsten Schmidt, 37, before cooking his head in a stewpot

Now Schneider has now been jailed for less than four years, after being found guilty of bodily harm resulting in death.

A police official, who said the men knew one another, said: 'It was a 
horror show. The body parts had been sawed, hacked and sliced.

'He put 
them all over the apartment as if saving them up for a rainy day.

'But only the head was cooked, bobbing in a stewpot on top of the cooker.'

During the hearing at the Berlin Regional Court, the court heard how the victim had invited Schneider to his apartment in Marienfelde, south Berlin, for sex in January 2012.

In court, the defence claimed Schmidt asked the defendant to tie him to the bed and cover his mouth and nose with tape.

The victim then died of suffocation, the court was told. It was then that Schneider cut up Schmidt's corpse.

Schmidt, who was openly gay, was due to go on to a party that evening with his friend. When he did not show up, the friend alerted police.

When it became clear Schneider was a suspect, the defendant slashed his wrists with a knife, but was saved by paramedica

During the trial, prosecutors argued that the defendant should have been sentenced to six years and nine months for manslaughter.

But
 his defence team called for their client 
to be found guilty of bodily harm resulting in death rather than 
manslaughter.

They successfully argued that the victim had wanted to die and that the accused was used simply as 'a tool in that process'.

In the court judgement it reportedly said: 'He is responsible for the death but he 
didn't want to kill his sexual partner.'

Cannibalism as a sexual fantasy is widespread in Germany.Â  It first hit the headlines in 2001 when Armin Meiwes killed, butchered and ate a computer technician called Bernd Brandes at his remote farmhouse home in Rotenburg near Kassel.

At his trial, several men who harboured fantasies of eating human flesh testified that there was a large network of like-minded individuals who connected through cyberspace in a bid to satisfy their fantasies.
