Visitors to London cannot fail to notice the capital’s many layers of history from its rugged Roman walls to elegant Georgian townhouses.

And now a group of historians has mapped the evolution of the capital from its roots as a Roman city in 43AD to the modern metropolis we navigate today.

The animation begins when London was focused in a square mile – which continued to as late as the 17th century - to the suburban sprawl of the 21st century, which magnified the size of the city to an area of 600 square miles (966km squared).

The etymology of London is uncertain but it is thought that it is Roman in origin.

The first recording of the name Londinium dates from the second century.

There was a theory that it originated from a 'King Lud' but this has been discarded.

Historians in the 17th Century maintained that the city's name is Celtic and means 'place belonging to a man called Londinos,' but again, this theory has been thrown out.

In 1998 Richard Coates suggested that London is pre-Celtic for (p)lowonida -  'river too wide to ford' - suggesting that it is named after the River Thames. It could have a Welsh and Roman origin.

Until 1889 the name 'London' only applied to the City of London, which was the Roman part of the city, but it now applies to the county and Greater London.

It maps the evolution of London’s bustling road network and menagerie of historical, listed buildings, including some of the capital’s most iconic landmarks, such as the Tower of London.

London is made up of a mishmash of architectural styles, unlike cities such as Rome, and these are clearly divided into ancient and more recent eras.

Created by the Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (Casa), the animation shows London’s industrialisation over 2,000 years.

The map took nine months to make and is based on datasets from the Museum of London Archaeology, Tudor maps from the Historic Towns Trust and historical maps showing road layouts from the 18th century to present day.

These were provided courtesy of the University of Cambridge.

While information about the city’s 19,000 listed buildings came from English Heritage and the Ordnance Survey.

While very little Roman architecture survives above ground, archaeological finds have been protected below the surface of the City, which are marked on this map in red

The network of roads expaned slightly in the Anglo Saxon and medieval period, although the population did not grow as rapidly as it was repeatedly hit with disease and famine

The experts are currently working on a 3D version, which would allow people to step back in time without pounding the busy streets, according to the blog of Polly Hudson, who was involved in the project.

In the video, the roads begin in Roman times with arteries converging in Londinium, especially the Square Mile, which is now filled with banks and skyscrapers.

They slowly become more intricate, while buildings gradually creep outwards into the countryside.

The roads are laid over a light modern map of London, while buildings of a certain period are marked by bright yellow dots.

The city was largely abandoned in 410AD by the Saxons who preferred to build large farms, and these formed the basis for places like Chelsea and Hampton.

But from the 9th century onwards London was back on its growth trajectory within the Roman walls, with Westminster becoming the first established political centre.

While the city started its life squashed into just one square mile, it is now a densely populated metropolis stretching from the City with its sky scrapers to leafier suburbs

London saw a growth in population in the Tudor period to almost 200,000, having previously been ravaged by famine and plague. A lot of development occured during the reign of King Henry VIII who destroyed a lot of the capital's religious sites. Major roads and listed builds are marked on this map

London is made up of a mishmash of architectural styles unlike cities such as Rome, which are clearly divided into ancient and more modern periods. Most Tudor buildings were based in the Square Mile, but Hampton Court Palace, in Greater London was Henry VIII's hunting lodge in the leafy suburbs

Between Roman times and the 17th century, buildings rotted away, burnt down or were deliberately damaged and were rebuilt in the styles of the day.

The Great Fire of London in 1666 was responsible for destroying four fifths of the city and so very few medieval buildings remain today.

By 1840, London was the most powerful city in the world with a population of 2 million and swathes of elegant Georgian houses and streets were built.

However, it was under the reign of Queen Victoria that the city exploded with a population of 6.5 million prospering from the Industrial Revolution.

Innovations such as steam trains and the London Underground enabled areas of Greater London to be developed for housing, and despite modern town planners between the 1940s and the 1970s demolishing some of the red brick properties, plenty of terraces remain in the suburbs.

World War Two decimated many buildings and the population but despite this, the 20th century saw the largest amount of growth in the country’s history.

Only the very best examples of 20th century development are protected today. The Lloyds Building is London’s most recently listed building able to be added to the list as it is now over 30 years old.

London has plenty of listed buildings from many different historical periods since its founding 2,000 years ago, but they make up a small percentage of the capital's housing stock

London was largely focused in one square mile from 43AD - when Londinium was established by the Romans - until the 17th century

It now covers around 600 square miles (966 square km) including the suburbs, which were largely established in Victorian times

Listed buildings from different periods are also included, the most recent of which is the Lloyd's Building
