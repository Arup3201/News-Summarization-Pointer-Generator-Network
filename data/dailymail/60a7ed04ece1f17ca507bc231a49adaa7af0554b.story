If you need the loo, you'll have to go in the dunes, and if you want a shower you'll have to walk to the communal shower block, but that doesn't stop this modest timber shed being Britain's most expensive beach hut.

With an asking price of £270,000, Hut 433 costs £5 more than a four-bedroomed detached house in the market town of Spalding, Lincolnshire, and the same as a six-bedroom house in Handsworth, Birmingham.

And you can only get to it by boat or on a novelty 'Noddy' train, followed by a half-mile hike across the dunes.  But the estate agents selling the modest hut on Mudeford Spit, near Christchurch in Dorset, are not anticipating problems finding a buyer.

Hut 433 is for sale for £270,000 - more than a four-bedroom house in the Lincolnshire market town of Holbeach - but the agents say its views are 'second to none'

Nice spot: The beach hut on Mudeford Spit near Christchurch, Dorset, boasts views across to the Needles and the Isle of Wight, and is just a short stroll to the water

Cosy: The hut can sleep ten (at a squash) with a first floor mezzanine,  two sofa beds and a pull-out double bed, and it has a small kitchen area and fridge freezer 

David Bird, from Austin and Wyatt, said: 'The location is second to none and there are beautiful views to the Needles and Isle of Wight.

'To my knowledge this is the most expensive beach hut in the area, but the reason is because of its position, as well as its high-standard interior and stunnings views.

'The owners have completely renovated it and everything was made by carpenters so the furniture is almost bespoke.  You can live in the huts for seven months of the year, and there's a really nice community down here.' 

The timber-built, 18ft by 12ft hut can sleep up to ten people, with four on a mezzanine deck, four on two sofa beds and two more on a pull-out bed.  It has hot water for the kitchen and electricity is powered by solar panels on the roof, and a cooker and small fridge run off a camping gas bottle.

On a £ per square foot basis, the asking price equates to £1,250/sq ft - equivalent to homes in London's Chelsea.  And in addition to the asking price, the new buyer will have to pay £4,000 ground rent to Christchurch Borough Council, and a £15,000 transfer fee.

Mr Bird said the hut was being sold by a family of five who are selling to buy another hut to do up with a different view on the sandy peninsula. 

The record price paid for a beach hut at Mudeford is £170,000, and one recently went on the market for £225,000.

The current owners have done a complete redecoration, which the estate agents say has contributed to its high price - believed to be the highest for a hut in the area

There's no loo or bathroom but there is hot and cold running water in the kitchen, and a fridge powered by a camping gas bottle... plus the breathtaking view

The owners' son demonstrates how much room there is once the sofa beds have been tucked away - ten people can fit in the hut, apparently, but it'll be a squeeze
