A pregnant woman in a wheelchair was tipped up and had her feet held by G4S staff as she was forcibly removed from the country.

The employees from the firm behind the Olympics security fiasco used substantial force and the 'risk of injury to the unborn child was significant', revealed a report.

They used force against six of 39 immigrant 
families, including two children, at Cedars 'pre-departure centre' in Pease Pottage, West Sussex.

Shocked: Campaigners have called on the UK Border Agency to crack down on the use of force by security officers

The centre holds 
families for up to a week before their removal.

Judith Dennis, of the Refugee Council, 
said the case was 'shocking' and called for the UK Border Agency (UKBA) 
to heed the report’s recommendations, which include that force should 
only ever be used against pregnant women and children 'in order to 
prevent harm'.

The pregnant woman had been given a wheelchair to assist her in the departures area, said the inspectors.

When she resisted, 'substantial force' was used by G4S staff and the wheelchair 'was tipped up with staff holding her feet'.

'At one point she slipped down from the chair and the risk of injury to the unborn child was significant,' the report said.

'There is no safe way to use force 
against a pregnant woman, and to initiate it for the purpose of removal 
is to take an unacceptable risk.'

Botched operation: Private contractors G4S were responsible for the security fiasco at the Olympic Games, when the army had to be called in after the firm failed to recruit enough staff

Cedars has largely replaced Yarl’s Wood immigration removal centre and families are offered 
support by the children’s charity Barnardo’s while security is provided 
by G4S.

Nick Hardwick, the Chief Inspector of Prisons, said: 'We were very concerned to find that 
force had been used to effect the removal of a pregnant woman, using 
non-approved techniques.

'There is no safe way to do this while 
protecting the unborn child and it is simply not acceptable to initiate 
force for such purposes.'

The pregnant woman’s husband had been disruptive the night before his family’s planned removal from Cedars, 'shouting and kicking doors, causing some damage', the report found.

'At one point it was judged that he had been trying to separate healthcare staff offering to examine his wife to take them hostage,' the report added.

'Staff were sufficiently concerned by his behaviour to take him to the "cool down" separation room in full personal protection equipment before his removal.'

The so-called 'cool down' room was 'stark and not conducive to helping people calm down', the inspectors added.

A G4S spokesman confirmed its staff were involved in incident.
