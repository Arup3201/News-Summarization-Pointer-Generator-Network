Police securing the Conservative party conference have gone to new lengths in their fight against crime - by drafting in a narrowboat. 

The canal barge, called Galley Pearl, has been unveiled in Birmingham to help the security effort around the conference, which begins tomorrow.

It has been converted to provide an HQ during the conference, which runs at the International Convention Centre (ICC) and Hyatt Hotel until Wednesday.

The floating police station strengthens the ring of steel around the conference, called Operation Pelkin.

In total, 1,000 security officers will be involved, including 600 police. Metropolitan Police will watch over the Prime Minister.

The barge initiative was the brainchild of Mike Olley, manager of Broad Street Business Improvement District.

He said: 'It just came to me when I was thinking about how imperative security will be when the Conservatives come to Birmingham.

'Not only will Birmingham and the ICC be the first UK city and venue to host all three major political parties, it is now the first UK city to have a floating police base.'

Assistant Chief Constable Gary Cann, who is leading the operation, said: 'We are proud to be able to play our part in this event and are confident that we will provide a safe and secure environment for all those who attend the conference and for everyone who lives and works in Birmingham.'
