Up to six Islamic terrorist cells may still be at large and ready to strike in mainland France, police warned last night.

The alert came as French Prime Minister Manuel Valls placed an extra 10,000 troops on the streets of Paris and warned: ‘We are at war.’

He said there were ‘without doubt’ accomplices to last week’s killings in Paris, after security services on both sides of the Channel warned that further attacks are ‘highly likely’.

Likely target: French army soldiers patrol Rue des Rosiers street, in the heart of Paris's Jewish quarter

Police sources put the number of potential cells within France at ‘up to six’.

Officials said one suspect had been seen driving a Mini Cooper car registered to Hayat Boumeddiene, the partner of Amedy Coulibaly, who was killed by police on Friday after murdering a woman officer and four Jewish hostages.

Boumeddiene is thought to have helped mastermind the Paris atrocities, which left 17 dead. The warning of more sleeper cells came as Mr Valls deployed thousands of armed police to guard Jewish schools around the clock, in response to Coulibaly’s attack on a kosher deli.

The fanatic said he had deliberately chosen a Jewish shop, claiming his victims were legitimate targets in revenge for the deaths of Muslims in Palestine.

Police later found he had maps showing the locations of Jewish schools in Paris.

Announcing the new security measures yesterday, Mr Valls said: ‘With regard to these barbaric terrorist acts, the work for justice and the investigation continues. We think that there were actually probably other accomplices too – the hunt will go on to find them.

He added: ‘I do not want there to be young people who identify with these barbaric terrorists who murdered journalists, police and French Jews just because they were Jews.’

Mr Valls said surveillance would also be improved and counter- terrorism officers given more resources following criticism of the security services.

Police had stopped tracking Coulibaly and Said and Cherif Kouachi – the brothers who killed 12 in an attack on the offices of the Charlie Hebdo magazine – six months ago because they were deemed to be low-risk. Official sources said scrutiny of the Kouachis and Coulibaly had been dropped to focus on other targets.

The trio were put under 24-hour phone, internet and physical surveillance at the end of 2011, when Said returned from Yemen, where he trained with Al Qaeda and met Anwar Al-Awlaki, the group’s terrorist mastermind who was later killed in a US drone strike.

CCTV footage emerged yesterday of the Kouachi brothers strolling into a petrol station with rocket launchers while on the run from police following the Charlie Hebdo massacre. The pair filled a black plastic bag with food and drink, their faces clearly visible despite their status as France’s most-wanted men.

The owner of the garage duly recognised the brothers, and alerted police who flooded the area – but the fanatics abandoned their car and escaped on foot.

They went on to take a hostage at a printing house near Charles de Gaulle airport, prompting a day-long stand-off that culminated in their deaths.

A day before he attacked the kosher deli, their accomplice Coulibaly shot dead newly-recruited policewoman Clarissa Jean-Philippe, 27, in the Paris district of Montrogue. Yesterday, it emerged that a Jewish school close to where the shooting took place may have been Coulibaly’s intended target.

Interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve visited the Yaguel Yaacov school yesterday. He said: ‘We are determined to ensure the protection of all the schools and places of worship in Paris and in France so that Jewish children keep going to school in complete security.’

Roger Cukierman, of the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France, said: ‘We have our sadness and rage ... we also have urgent measures to take.’

Private Jewish security cars were also out in force in north-west London yesterday following the kosher deli murders. The cars look similar to police vehicles but bear the security group’s name Shomrim – Hebrew for guards – along the sides and back.
