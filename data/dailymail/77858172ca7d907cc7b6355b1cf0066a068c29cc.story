They have graced the silver screen for many years. Watching them at the Golden Globes, however, you might have mistaken them for young ingenues.

Despite being well into their forties and beyond, with their plump cheeks and smooth complexions some of Hollywood’s elder stateswomen look suspiciously younger than their years.

Julianne Moore, who picked up the Golden Globe for best actress for her performance in the film Still Alice, barely seemed to have changed since her first victory at the ceremony 21 years ago.

The actress, 54, has previously said she wants to age as ‘naturally as possible’ but her persistently glamorous looks have started to raise a few eyebrows.

Fresh faced: Catherine Zeta-Jones, 45, and Ally McBeal star Calista Flockhart, 50 at the Golden Globes

Former Ally McBeal star Calista Flockhart, who attended with her husband Harrison Ford, looked much younger than her 50 years with her wrinkle-free appearance.

Jennifer Aniston, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Jennifer Lopez, all 45, also turned heads with their fresh faces.

Miss Lopez said last year that she is ‘terrified’ of plastic surgery and vowed to never go under the knife. Miss Zeta-Jones, who is married to Michael Douglas, has been dogged by persistent rumours of plastic surgery but these have never been fully confirmed.

And former Friends star Miss Aniston has previously admitted to having laser skin peels to help maintain her youthful looks.

Even one of the younger stars – Kate Hudson, the 35-year-old daughter of Goldie Hawn – seems to have resisted the ageing process since her breakthrough role in film Almost Famous nearly 15 years ago.

Eddie Redmayne led the British winners at the Golden Globes, beating Benedict Cumberbatch to be named best actor in a film drama for playing Stephen Hawking in The Theory Of Everything.

Redmayne, 33, who was accompanied by his new bride Hannah Bagshawe revealed he had to cut his honeymoon short to pick up the award. He told the audience: ‘Thanks for giving us a honeymoon we’ll remember.’

There were also awards for Joanne Froggatt and Ruth Wilson. Miss Froggatt, 34, was best supporting actress in a TV series for her role as Anna in Downton Abbey, and Miss Wilson, 32, was named best actress in a TV drama for her role in The Affair.
