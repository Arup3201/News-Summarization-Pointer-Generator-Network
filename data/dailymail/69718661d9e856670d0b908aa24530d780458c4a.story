Katy Perry's religious parents have managed to see something positive in the breakdown of their daughter's one year marriage.

The
pair spoke about their daughter's divorce for the first time - from the
pulpit of their evangelical church, which was unusually packed it 
seems.

Pastors Keith and 
Mary Hudson were seen taking to the stage to speak out about their 
famous daughter and the audience appeared captivated.

The ministers suggested her split with Russell Brand was a gift sent by God - to help them fill churches.

The service was held on Wednesday, and yesterday 
removal containers were seen in the grounds of the celebrity couple's 
$6.5 million Hollywood Hills mansion, ready to cart away their 
belongings.

Mary, 63, preached to the Church on the Rise congregation in 
Westlake, Ohio: 'I'm sure that Katy's trending on the Internet was to get you here to church tonight.

'I mean all over the world, who knows how God is bringing them in? The 
most important thing is you are here and God wants to put the fire in 
you in 2012.'

Mary was
dressed in an all black ensemble with over the knee bots and a black 
jumper which she accessorised with a chunky silver necklace.

She and husband Keith, 63, billed themselves as 'Katy Perry's parents in marketing materials for the event, reported CNN.

Keith
was also dressed in an all-black ensemble consisting of a baroque print
shirt and smart trousers accesorised with a silver chain.

They spoke for about 90 minutes to 300 worshippers in the first service since Katy's split with the comedian on Friday.

A video was shown before the Hudsons took the stage in Ohio showed them at award shows with Katy.

Keith told the crowd he converted from a drug user 
to a Christian when he was 24 years old.

He added that his daughter's success had helped the couple share their beliefs with Hollywood superstars.

"What has taken place in my daughter's life has opened many 
opportunities to go in and be with guarded and gated people.

'God has given us a platform to go in and meet people — and they like us because we are cool. We are not threatening.'

Katy was brought up as a devout Christian in Santa Barbara, California. 
She listened only to gospel music and was banned from watching TV.

Keith also choked back tears when talking about his daughter's different lifestyle, reported The Sun.

'I love my daughter and I will always love her.
Stop being judgmental and critical. Do not close the doors to your 
loved ones, especially your children.

'Just because they do not 
like what you do or what you are, they are still praying that you stay 
in the race. They are counting on you.

'I believe in God, for every one of my children.'

However they are sure to attract criticism after Keith made 'joke' remarks many would consider anti-Semitic.

He said: 'You know how to make the Jew jealous? Have some money, honey.

'You go to LA and they own all the Rolex and diamond places. Walk down a part of LA where we live and it is so rich it smells.

'You ever smell rich? They are all Jews, hallelujah. Amen.'

The
service comes as it was claimed the 14-month marriage ended because 
Russell continuously mocked his in-laws' beliefs at family events.

It has also emerged Katy will stay in the couple's $6.5 million Hollywood Hills 
mansion and Russell will move out.

Sources close to told TMZ the moving process is already 
under way and most of the camp comic's belongings are already out of the home. 

It seems the pair are still on reasonably good terms as the decision over the house went reasonably smoothly.

The couple had purchased the home together just a
few months ago.

Moving on: Russell was spotted leaving his 
manager's home in Primrose Hill, London, yesterday as removal containers
were seen at his and Katy's LA mansion

Friends said the singer had asked 
Russell to file the court papers last month to avoid upsetting her 
parents, who are strongly opposed to divorce.

The comments were revealed by biographer Chloe Govan, author of Katy Perry: A Life of Fireworks.A friend said: 'Russ was forever making lewd jokes at the dinner table and poking fun at her parents' beliefs.

'He
managed to restrain himself in the beginning — just. But as the 
marriage progressed, he got worse and kept winding up her family.'

Another added: 'After the lust wore off, reality hit home about their differences and she was left thinking, 'What have I done?'

Other rumours say the split was because Katy couldn’t keep up with 
Russell’s appetite in the bedroom, and he disapproval of her party 
lifestyle.

Russell, 36, has reportedly been 
uninvited from the People's Choice Awards in Los Angeles on Wednesday to
avoid a confrontation with Katy.

She is expected to make her fist 
appearance since the split at the show where she is nominated for seven 
awards, including Favourite Female Artist.

A source told the Daily Mirror: 'It will be Katy’s big night, a prelude to the Grammys, 
and now Russell has been strangely left off the list of attendees for 
the high-profile event.

'It was always going to be awkward for organisers in any case after 
their shock decision to split. But in order to avoid any awkwardness or 
confrontation Russ is no longer on the list.'

She is said to be holed up in the LA home she shared with Russell, which they purchased in June.

The
comedian-turned-actor has been seen on a number of occasions since 
releasing a statement about the divorce, and was yesterday spotted 
leaving his manger's home in Primrose Hill, London.

The
couple, who were married in India October 2010, spent Christmas 
thousands of miles apart, with Katy in Hawaii and Russell in Cornwall.

They were both pictured without their wedding rings.

He filed for divorce on January 30.

Meanwhile,
a new song has been leaked in which Katy sings about shooting bad 
lovers. Recorded before the split, Bullet, tells how her dad will gun 
down men who break her heart.

She sings: 'My mama warned me about boys like you,

'It’s the reason I wear these high-heeled boots.

'And let me give you a little piece of advice.

'My papa packs heat and he won’t think twice.'

Katy wrote it for US country singer Jessie James, 23, but it is her voice on the leaked version.
