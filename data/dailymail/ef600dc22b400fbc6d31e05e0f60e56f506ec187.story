Apple is reportedly in talks with senior television figures about its Apple iTV product - an voice-controlled all-in-one flatscreen that was the brainchild of late CEO Steve Jobs.

But the release of iTV has prompted a lot of top TV makers to start looking into the idea of voice-control - with or without linguistic skills to match Apple's Siri voice assistant.

LG is leading the charge - with a new voice-enabled version of its 'Magic' gesture-controlled remote. The product should be on show at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January - alongside a lot of other iTV wannabes, analysts predict.

The new 'Magic' voice remote will let users speak to control their televisions - a microphone and voice-recognition software built into the remote make your voice work like an internet search

'The new Magic Remote will make it easier for users to approach LG TVs - particularly our Smart TV function which now has over 1,000 apps,' said Havis Kwon, president of LG Electronics.

'Talking' to the remote works like an internet search term - so it's ideal for finding shows quickly rather than browsing through a whole TV channel.

Rumours flew that Apple itself would unveil iTV in January - either at CES or to coincide with it (which seems more likely given the electronics giant's usual reluctance to appear).

Analyst Peter Misek at Jefferies predicted that the imminent launch of iTV would have rivals 'scrambling' and reluctant to be caught 'flat-footed.'

So far, LG is the only manufacturer to have let details of its version slip - but many tech insiders suspect that voice control may be as ubiquitous at CES this year as 3D has been in previous years.
