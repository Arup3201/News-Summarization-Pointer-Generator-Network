Tennis ace Roger Federer is set to move into a £6.5million glass mansion in a Swiss tax-haven on the shores of Lake Zurich.

Federer and his family are set to move in to the state-of-the-art three-storey building at the end of the year, and are believed to be joined by his parents Robert and Lynette, who could be the new residents in the two luxury apartments being built in addition to the main home.

The building, called The Residence, is located in Wollerau in Schwyz county, and comes with  floor-to-ceiling windows, a swimming pool and large balconies with magnificent views stretching across Lake Zurich.

Roger Federer has racked up 17 Grand Slam titles during his career and is often regarded as the best tennis player of all time

Federer is building a £6.5million 'glass home' on the hills overlooking Lake Zurich in Switzerland

The house, called 'The Residence' is in Wollerau, Schwyz county, and has floor-to-ceiling glass windows throughout

Federer, 33, moved from his birthplace of Basel to the 'tax paradise' of Wollerau in March 2008, one year before marrying Slovakian-born Mirka, 36.

Located about 20 minutes drive from Zurich, and an hour from Basel, Wollerau is one of the lowest tax municipalities in Europe and the liberal tax structure has attracted other multi-millionaires.

Formula One drivers Kimi Räikkönen and Felipe Massa and the former UBS chairman Marcel Ospel have all chosen to live in the canton.

Federer's new glass-walled home, being built on a plot of about 1.5 acres with underground parking, is believed to be worth £6.5million.

The  500sq.m property will have plenty of room  for Federer, Mirka  and their two sets of twins – five-year-old girls Myla and Charlene and boys Leo and Lenny, born last May.

Due to the location on the hillside and the property overlooking the water, there will be no insight into the home, despite the glass walls

Federer famously likes to take his whole brood on the road, and brought both sets of twins to Wimbledon this year, despiter Leo and Lenny being just a few weeks old.

He said at a press conference after his sons were born that taking them all on the road is hard work but worth it.

'My wife does a lot of work, as much as she can. And I try to help as much as I can,' he explained. 'We have the grandparents as well and all my team members, they sometimes just tag along. Clearly we also need some help on the road, so Mirka can have an opportunity sometimes to sleep in a little bit, or come to watch one of my matches.

'You need to be well organised, but by now we know how it works. I am looking forward to life on the tour with the family, and it will be a long time without any travelling after the tennis is over. So I'm looking forward to the next couple of years now.' 

Scores of builders have been working to get the impressive structure completed this year, described as 'prestigious, contemporary architecture with extensive glazing,' by the developer, Kamata Development. 

The additional flats are believed to be for Federer's parents Robert and Lynette, pictured here with Mirka and the couple's oldest daughters, Myla Rose and Charlene Riva, during the 2012 Wimbledon tournament

The surrounding properties are built in similar luxurious style, climbing on the hillside and overlooking the water
