A food factory worker was killed when a 'wall' of frozen fish pallets fell on top of him as he tried to rebuild a stack that had already toppled over once, an inquest heard.

Tomas Suchy, 22, was helping colleagues re-stack a pile of boxes which had fallen over in the store room of Interfish in Plymouth, Devon, when the incident occurred.

The Slovakian-born worker and three fellow employees had almost finished stacking the pallets in the stock room, where temperatures are -25C, when the pile gave way.

A co-worker sounded the alarm by shouting 'run away' but it was too late and Mr Suchy was killed instantly by 'catastrophic' head injuries caused by the falling boxes.

The boxes weighed 25 kilos and there were 52 on each pallet.

Mr Suchy, who studied architecture at university, was hit by a number of pallets and also suffered a number of other fatal injuries, the inquest into his death in Plymouth heard yesterday.

Robert Lanjeckl, who had worked at Interfish for a year prior to the accident, told the inquest: 'We had nearly finished the work and then suddenly (a co-worker) was shouting "run away".

'The whole wall just fell over.'

The inquest also heard from former employees of Interfish, who said it was not an isolated incident and criticised the company over its poor health and safety.

Tom Reid, a former forklift-driver at Interfish said that he had been involved in a similar incident in the past, and suffered a shoulder injury from falling boxes of fish.

He described the pallets as in 'pretty bad condition' and said that he had warned his manager of the dangers.

He said: 'I told my manager: "This is s***. It is dangerous".

'He said: "Do the best you can" and to "carry on".'

The Slovakian-born worker suffered 'catastrophic' head injuries after being crushed by pallets, which fell on top of him while he was trying to stack them at food-processing firm Interfish (pictured) in Plymouth, Devon

Emma O'Hara, a health and safety executive, said there was 'no robust monitoring' at the food processing firm.

She told Mr Suchy's inquest: 'The boxes were stacked excessively high. Some of the stacks looked unstable and were leaning into one another.

'Some had not been placed directly on the one below and one stack was balanced on only two boxes of fish that weren't palletised.

'There were a number of damaged boxes and pallets.

'There was no safe system of work or instruction to staff. Safe checking relied on (experienced) staff working in the area.'

After Mr Suchy's death, the food processing company was handed four prohibition notices and one improvement notice by the Health and Safety Executive.

The firm complied with each and introduced a range of measures to ensure similar incidents do not occur.

The legal representative for Interfish said: 'Everything the company was asked to do was done.'

The coroner returned a verdict of accidental death at the inquest.
