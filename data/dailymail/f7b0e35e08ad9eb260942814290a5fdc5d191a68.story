A Kentucky woman has been charged with wanton endangerment after police say she left her two children in a hot car on Wednesday afternoon in order to get a bikini wax.

Courtney Kippes, 22, allegedly left her two-year-old and three-year-old sons in her car and headed to a Louisville beauty salon to get a Brazilian wax.

Local business owners heard the children screaming in the vehicle which was parked in the 2,800 block of Frankfort Avenue.

Temperatures soared to 84 degrees Wednesday afternoon, with a heat index of 87 at 2:40pm when the children were locked in the car.

Kippes had left a front window open a crack, but according to WLKY, they were both very sweaty and hot to the touch.

Business owners managed to get the little boys out of the car and police were called.

When Kippes returned, she told the officers she was 'OK with leaving the kids' in the car and that she'd been 'getting a wax job.'

More charges: Police also found drugs and drug paraphernalia inside Kippes's car

The boys were transported to Kosair Children's Hospital for evaluation.

When police searched Juppes's car, they found a crushed-up pill and a snorting straw, reports WLKY.

She allegedly told the owner of Clique Salon and Spa, where she paid $60 for the wax job, that she didn't have a any children.

She has been charged with first-degree wanton endangerment, second-degree possession of a controlled substance and possession of drug paraphernalia.

Kippes lists her profession on Facebook as 'model.'

She is scheduled to face court on May 30.
