After spending more than 200 years entombed in a cramped cellar - Britain's oldest yacht has been given a new home.

The Peggy, built in 1791, lay in her original boat cellar on the Isle of Man for a century following the death of her first owner George Quayle - before being rediscovered in the 1930s.

In a painstaking operation, the historic 26ft vessel was moved to a purpose-built climate-controlled conservation facility this week, in the hope that it will continue to survive the test of time.

Britain's oldest yacht: After spending more than 200 years entombed in a cramped cellar - The Peggy has been given a new home

Predating the reign of Queen Victoria, the Battle of Waterloo and the death of Mozart, the boat is fitted with sliding keels, one of only a few with this 18th century innovation still in existence.

She is also the only surviving shallop - a light boat used for rowing or sailing in shallow water, typical of the 17th and 18th century.  

Manx National Heritage, the organisation responsible for protecting and promoting the Isle of Man's heritage and culture, have now transferred her from the cellar within the Nautical Museum in Castletown, to a storage unit in Douglas on the Isle of Man. 

Following a 24-hour delay due to high winds, the 18th century relic was lifted by cradle and then crane, and transported to the recently-purchased climate-controlled conservation facility.

The Peggy will now be stabilised, examined and conserved.Her first owner,Christopher Weeks, Objects Conservator, Manx National Heritage, said: 'It's been six years in the planning. 

The Peggy, Britain's oldest yacht, was commissioned in 1791 by Captain George Quayle, a prominent politician and banker from Castletown in the Isle of Man.

Quayle (1751-1835) was a member of the House of Keys, the directly elected lower branch of Tynwald, the parliament of the Isle of Man, for 51 years. 

During the wars with France from 1793, he was an officer in successive Manx forces raised for Island defence. 

He was also co-founder of the earliest bank in the Isle of Man and an enthusiastic inventor and traveller.

Qauyle built the vessel her own cellar - where she lay for more than a century after his death.

She was rediscovered in 1930, underwent repair work and has since been carefully conserved in her cellar on the Isle of Man.

'We've done a lot of work in preparing the boat, supporting it with a steel cradle and readying the Quayle's dock so that it could accept the boat when we took it out of the cellar that it had been sitting in for 200 years before finally preparing the whole thing for lifting and transportation. 

'The main reason that we're moving her is that her fixings have been consumed by rust and we need to arrest that. 

'The Peggy is a highly significant vessel and the progenitor for any yacht you' ll see in any harbour in the world. 

'It is one of the most important objects that we are responsible for on the Island.'

After her rediscovery, structural repair work was carried out during the late 1940s when the vessel was repaired by local craftsmen. 

This involved the replacement of the keel, stem post and two planks, all of which were damaged when she lay on her starboard side.

The Nautical Museum will now undergo partial redevelopment and refurbishment to improve the entrance and shop area with a new 'Quayle Gallery', telling more of the personal story of George Quayle and his family as well as the Peggy.

Recent archaeological investigation and archival research has established that the site was home to possibly the earliest slipway in the British Isles, and that Quayle subsequently replaced this with a unique private dock, which acted as a sea lock. 

Exhibits will include a number of recent finds from the 2014 excavations including a leather pistol holster, a flintlock pistol mechanism, some coconut shell drinking cups, and what is believed to be an eighteenth century microscope. 

The Nautical Museum will reopen to the public in May 2015 following completion of the improvement works and the gallery refresh.
