If there were ever any doubts that showing off is in Pudsey the dancing dog’s blood, this family picture should dispel them. 

The Britain’s Got Talent star has been enjoying some well-deserved time off with his brothers Hero, Toggle and Kez, and sisters Piper and Becky. 

The litter of six were all back together for the first time since puppyhood at a party to celebrate Christmas and their forthcoming seventh birthday which is on Friday.

Most of them were happy to pose in festive headgear – with one notable exception.

Becky’s owner Teresa McAteer had to use all her powers of persuasion – and some out-and-out bribery – to get her pet in the line-up.

The problem was that Becky’s Santa hat was too big and kept falling over her eyes. Finally a smaller substitute was found, along with a few tasty doggy treats, and Becky completed the sextet.

Pudsey, who has been performing with his owner Ashleigh Butler in the Dick Whittington pantomime at Woking, Surrey, took a break from his hectic schedule to spend some time with his very different siblings, who came from all over the country to see him at his digs in Guildford.

Ashleigh, 17, said: ‘Pudsey doesn’t really get time to spend with other dogs so it is nice for him to have fun with his brothers and sisters.

Reluctant diva: Becky's owner Teresa tried a variety of Santa hats on her pet - who remained distinctly unimpressed by the whole affair

They see each other at dog shows but this is the first time we’ve been able to get them all in one place at the same time since they were born.’

As with most family reunions, sibling rivalry inevitably came into play with the animals trying to outdo each other with their dancing tricks. ‘They do normally get on, but I think they’re just quite excited,’ Ashleigh explained. 

Pudsey and Ashleigh shot to fame after becoming the first dog act to win Britain’s Got Talent in May.

Now a household name, Pudsey has performed in front of the Queen as a part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations and even has his own book – Pudsey: My Autobidography.

And it would appear that his star quality runs right through the family. 

All the dogs, which are a mixture of border collie, Bichon Frise and Chinese Crested, have appeared in calendars or taken part in agility shows and Scruffts, the Kennel Club’s contest for crossbreeds. 

Kez’s owner Janette Sharpe, who travelled to the reunion from Lincolnshire, said: ‘They all love performing and standing up on their hind legs, and they are not exactly strangers to diva-ish behaviour. It is obvious they are all related!’

■ Pudsey: My Autobidography is out now priced £9.99.
