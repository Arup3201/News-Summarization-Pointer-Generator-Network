This is the heart-warming moment two young African elephants locked trunks in a touching embrace that was caught on camera.

The very public display of human-like affection was photographed by Jacques Matthysen at the Kariega Game Reserve, east of Port Elizabeth, South Africa.

It occurred while a herd of nearly 30 elephants playfully chased each other and rolled around on the floor at the popular tourist destination.

Jacques, who works as a photographer for the reserve, said he is used to seeing the young elephants act in a playful manner, but their affectionate behaviour took him by surprise.

As Jacques and a group of visitors looked on, two of the elephants stopped chasing each other and entwined their trunks in a loving gesture.

At one point it appeared as if they were ‘kissing’.

The 37-year-old photographer said: ‘The mood in the herd seemed “excited”. We moved out to a safer distance - about 50 metres (164ft) - away when one of the younger bulls, about eight years of age, started chasing a younger bull.

‘What we first thought to be aggression, turned out to be all playfulness.

‘Soon a number of younger bulls and cows started to play around. They pushed, head butted and rolled onto each other for quite a few minutes.

‘Soon after, it looked like they were embracing each other, with gentle touches to the faces with their trunks.’

Jacques Matthysen, the game reserve's photographer, said the elephants' affectionate behaviour caught him by surprise

He said two of the elephants locked trunks like humans would hold hands.

‘I quickly focused my camera on them, to capture the “loving” moment.

‘I am very happy with the sighting and images. This just shows us how these giants, that can be so dangerous and so aggressive, can in fact be so gentle and loving animals.’
