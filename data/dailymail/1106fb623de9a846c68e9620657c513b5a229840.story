Jordan Henderson has insisted the vast majority of England youngsters will want to play in the European Under-21 championship this summer – but that pressure from club managers can make it difficult.

Henderson says that his time with the Under-21 was a huge learning curve, even though when he played in Under-21 Euro 2013 as captain, England lost all three games in a deeply disappointing tournament. Henderson also played in the 2011 European Under 21 championship, in which England also failed to win.

But with a club versus country row already developing over the availability of Harry Kane this summer, Henderson has urged the current generation to take their chance to play if they can

Henderson said: ‘I would tell any of those young lads to go out there and play in tournament football for their country at any level.

‘I thought I gained a lot of experience doing that. It wasn’t all good as I had two Under-21 tournaments and we didn’t do that well in either. We could have done a lot better with the team we had – but I learnt a lot from playing in those games.

‘There was never any doubt for me. All I wanted to do was go and play. Obviously people get injuries, which you can't help, but if you're fit, I wanted to go. You've got to manage it with the club managers, who think about the best interest of the player. And you've got to understand that. But for me personally I want to play every game for club and country and if I'm fit I'll want to play at a tournament whatever the level.

Henderson says that most of the players do want to play – but that pressure from clubs is the reason why sometimes are withdrawn from age-group squads. ‘I'm not sure it's players needing convincing,’ said Henderson. ‘If you asked all the lads they'd want to play. But managers of clubs have to manage the player the best they can and their best interest is the player.

‘If they feel the player is playing a lot of games and are afraid they'll burn out, that's an issue. But for me I just wanted to play as much football as I could, whenever for, and though the tournaments didn't turn out how we wanted, I gained a lot of experience.’
