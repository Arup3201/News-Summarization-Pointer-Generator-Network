So, they have missed out on the first piece of silverware of the year. A last minute goal, scruffily conceded from a set piece, would suggest Brendan Rodgers was left tearing his hair out on a sultry night in Boston.

If anything, the opposite was true. Liverpool's manager will not be losing any sleep after Daniel Agger's late own goal clinched the grandly-named Buick Trophy for Roma and for good reason. Liverpool's squad took a step closer to full fitness and a classy performance from Philippe Coutinho augers well for the future.

Anfield may be mourning the departure of one sumptuously gifted South American but there is no doubt Coutinho has the ability to fill Luis Suarez's void and cement his place in Liverpool affections.

Liverpool: Jones, Kelly, Skrtel, Coates, Enrique, Lucas, Allen, Coutinho, Borini, Lambert, Ibe

Subs: Ward, Agger, Henderson, Can, Suso, Coady, Phillips, Robinson, Peterson

Roma: Skorupski, Somma, Benatia, Castan, Cole, Florenzi, Keita, Nainggolan, Iturbe, Totti, Ljajic

If there was concern for Rodgers from 
the game, it was the shoulder injury to Fabio Borini that curtailed his 
night after just nine minutes but, that apart, this was just the kind of
 work out Liverpool were looking for. And, with key performers such as 
Steven Gerrard, Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana to slot in - plus the 
imminent arrival of Loic Remy to provide more forward options - it was 
no surprise to see Rodgers make the post match lap of the pitch sporting
 a relaxed smile.

Results do
 not matter at this stage of the campaign, it is about making sure 
preparations go smoothly and since they have been in the United States, 
Liverpool's have gone like clockwork. Another step forward will now be 
essential when they face Olympiacos in Chicago on Sunday in the Guinness
 International Cup.

Rodgers'
 team stepped up on their opening friendly performances against Brondby 
and Preston with a more accomplished workout against the classy Romans, 
for whom Ashley Cole was making his first appearance.

Novelty: Fans in the stands at Fenway Park were in good voice despite a lacklustre opening

It
 was a tight game, one that looked destined to be decided by a penalty 
shootout but in the dying moments, substitute Marco Borriello’s header 
took a big deflection off Agger, wrong-footing Liverpool keeper Brad
 Jones and securing the win for Roma.

Cole,
 as you would expect, cruised through this contest for the time he was 
on and while he was booed by a small pocket of Liverpool fans, he was 
involved in the best scoring chance of what was sterile first 45 
minutes.

With the pitch hard
 and the temperature high, neither team was in a hurry to press and 
press as they would normally but in the 33rd minute, Cole scampered down
 the left-flank to catch Radja Nainggolan’s pass and, typically, he 
produced a perfect cut back.

Unfortuately
 for Cole, Francesco Totti, the veteran striker, slightly mistimed his 
run and he only succeeded in making a connection with his knee, sending 
the ball fizzing past the wrong side of Brad Jones’ right-hand post.

Liverpool
 had offered little in the opening half, other than shot from outside 
the area that Coutinho dragged wide but, after the break, they 
were a different proposition and dominated the game in terms of chances 
created and possession.

Coutinho,
 a surprising omission from Brazil’s World Cup squad, was the reason 
Liverpool were able to wrestle back the initiative, his dancing feet and
 elusive movement carrying him beyond challenges and into the areas that
 matter.

Blessed with energy
 and vision, he has all the attributes needed to flourish in the 
Barclays Premier League and with Suarez now gone, the stage could 
be set for Coutinho to step up a level and become a star in his own 
right.

He created 
Liverpool’s best chance in the second period when he slipped a ball into
 Rickie Lambert’s feet but the England striker’s powerful shot after 56 
minutes was beaten away by Roma keeper Lukasz Skorupski.

Injury concern: Fabio Borini holds his shoulder and receives treatment after falling awkwardly

Trouble: The injury could come as a blow to Liverpool's attempts to sell Borini to Sunderland

A
 raft of substitutions from both sides disrupted the flow of the contest
 from then – Coutinho was given a standing ovation when his time was up –
 on but the injury to Borini aside, Rodgers had reason to be satisfied, 
not least when he thinks back to his last visit to Fenway Park two years
 ago.

Roma were the 
opposition back then and they ran out comfortable 2-1 winners, 
illustrating that Rodgers had a significant amount of work to do to 
implement his vision and get Liverpool, who had just finished eighth, in
 a position to challenge again.

Borriello’s
 header ensured another defeat at this famous old stadium but Rodgers 
has confidence that Liverpool will again be a match for the best around 
and, with another three weeks to hone their game, they should be in 
shape for when it matters on August 17 against Southampton.
