With the cast from The Only Way is Essex often seen enjoying takeaways, you can forgive this chip shop owner for thinking her Towie-themed restaurant would fit into place.

Francesca Clark thought nothing of naming her new chippy The Only Way is Fish when she opened for business five months ago in Ongar, Essex.

But now Towie bosses have called in the lawyers - because they say the name is in breach of the company's copyright.

Not sharking the issue: Chris Nelson, Francesca Clark and Carly Rose from The Only Way is Fish, which is being threatened with legal action by bosses from the production company behind The Only Way is Essex

Francesca Clark deliberately used a logo similar to the one used on the show - but has a disclaimer explaining the shop is not connected to the hit TV series

Lime Pictures, the production company behind the show, has allegedly written a strongly-worded letter to the shop's owners, warning them they could land in trouble for using the phrase 'The Only Way is'.

The company, which also produces shows such as Hollyoaks, allegedly told Ms Clark she had just 14 days to change the name and logo of the shop - unless she wanted to face legal action.

The show, which says it has copyrighted the four words, has already been behind several new slang words and phrases since it hit screens in 2010. One of the best-known is 'reem', a word coined by former star Joey Essex to mean desirable, cool or good-looking.

Business partner John Edwards said: 'We
 are not hurting anyone and we are not misleading anyone into thinking 
we have anything to do with the programme. It’s just a gimmick.'

Ms Clark said she gave her shop a 'cheesy, blingy and glitzy' decor and used a logo similar to the one used for the show, intentionally.

She even displayed a sign explaining to Towie fans that the shop was not affiliated with the show.

But the disclaimer doesn't seem quite enough for the company's lawyers, who have allegedly told the business to stop trading under its current branding.

In the letter, it said the shop should 'immediately cease and desist from using our logo or otherwise trading under our marks'.

It also told the company to 'immediately' remove its Facebook page.

The letter said: 'Confirm to us in writing within 14 days of the date of this letter that you have complied with the above'.

But Mr Edwards said the business would fight the legal bigwigs 'to the end'.

The shop also posted a message on their Facebook site which read: 'Customer Notice. We have been contacted by the producers of The Only Way is Essex regarding the content of our Trading Name The Only Way Is Fish.

'I would like to remind all our customers
 and the general public, that we are no way affiliated or endorsed by 
Lime Pictures holding Ltd or ITV Productions.

Lime Pictures said the shop has breached the company's copyright after using 'The Only Way Is' in its name

'Although a request has been made for our trading name to cease trading, at this stage!

'We have not decided what our next step will be. Quite frankly we think it's a joke... 100% bulling (sic) & against human rights.....'

Project manager Kevin Gibbons said: 'I 
don’t understand how you can copyright a phrase, it’s ridiculous. We do a
 good job and that’s why we are successful and busy.'

Chef Chris Nelson said: 'I don’t think 
the sign has brought us any extra business and a name change wouldn’t 
make much difference but it’s not about that. It’s about the principle.'

A spokesman for Lime Pictures told MailOnline: 'We own the intellectual property in The Only Way Is brand and we will take steps to protect our brand in line with industry practice.'
