Jose Mourinho insists he will not afford Petr Cech any preferential treatment after he was axed as Chelsea's No 1.

Sportsmail revealed on Wednesday the Czech Republic international, who has spent 10 years at Stamford Bridge, has been kept in the dark over the reasons why Thibault Courtois started in front of him against Burnley on Monday.

Mourinho confirmed on Friday he has offered no explanation to the goalkeeper over his decision to opt for Courtois.

And the Blues boss insists he will maintain his stance, saying: 'I haven't spoken with Petr, because if I speak with him, tomorrow I have to speak to another one, another one, another one. I've never done this in my career.'I don't believe he's totally happy, but that's him

'I don't have to speak to players about decisions. I don't like to be always justifying my decisions to the players. 'They all know where my office is. If they need an explanation, I never close the door. I'll give one.

'I didn't do it with Frank Lampard, with Didier Drogba before the last game... I don't speak with players about that.'

Mourinho, however, has indicated the club would have to consider letting Cech leave if he informed them he wanted to quit Chelsea.

'I hope he doesn't want to leave, and until this moment we don't have any sign that can happen,' said the Portuguese. 

'If that situation comes, he deserves us sitting with him and listening to him. He deserves everything from this club.

'But I hope that day doesn't come. I repeat, for the good of my team and Chelsea, that doesn't happen.'
