Any mother who is charged with getting a young family ready in the morning knows exactly how physically demanding it can be.

And it is a daily reality Lili Kirtin-Grossman - who is only eight - knows all too well.

Before Lili, from Barnet, north London, even heads out to school in the morning she has to help to get three people dressed, as well as put on the wash and make breakfast for her family.

'Capable' Lili Kirtin-Grossman, 8, helps to support her mum Sarah, who suffers from a degenerative spine condition and has been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder, with looking after her two younger siblings

The young schoolgirl knows how to work the family washing machine and will frequently put on a load of washing before going to school in a morning 

Lili has been identified as one of Britain's youngest carers, looking after her younger siblings Kaya and Tyler as well as her mother, Sarah.

The 37-year-old, who is an ex-dancer, is registered disabled and suffers from a degenerative condition - scoliosis - which causes the spine to curve.

The painful illness not only makes it difficult for her to walk but can leave her in agony. In addition, Sarah has been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder, which has seen her sectioned twice.

Sarah is separated from Lili's father Graeme and has two other younger children, three-year-old Tyler, who suffers from ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and two-year-old Kaya, who, more often than not, Lili is charged with taking care of. 

She told the Mirror: 'I've always done lots to help Mummy. She wakes me up in the morning around 7am - I'm normally a bit tired, but I get myself dressed and then help Kaya out of her cot, because we share a room.'

An average day continues with Kaya preparing 'Coco Pops and milk' for her little sister and making her mother a cup of tea.

Lili adds: 'Some mornings I'll run Mummy a bath. Depending on how well she is, she can dress herself, but I help with things she finds hard, like putting on her socks and shoes. Then, when we've all got our bags and coats on, I go to school.'

Lili's story is all too familiar. According to the charity Carers Trust, there are currently estimated to be at least 180,000 carers under 18 in the UK. The organisation has launched a new website, Babble.carers.org, specifically for children who are caring for siblings or grown ups.

The charity adds that many children feel they can't share the burden of what's happening at home, with up to 39 per cent of young carers not admitting to a teacher that they are looking after someone. 

Another harrowing statistic is that children caring for others often face bullying, with 68 per cent of young carers saying they have faced name-calling at school.

Lili is a dab hand in the kitchen but says she doesn't feel like she's missing out: 'The only time I feel a bit jealous of other kids is when I go to their houses to play and their mums start fetching them crisps'

For Lili, school offers some respite from the relentless routine at home. When the school bell rings in the afternoon, Lili can often find herself head of the kitchen, preparing family staples such as spaghetti bolognese and pie and mash. Although Sarah arranges for food shopping to be delivered, little Lili is no stranger to running errands and is a familiar face at the local shops. 

'I'm used to shop assistants and customers looking surprised and asking me if I'm by myself,' smiles Lili. 'I just explain my Mummy is outside waiting, and I make sure I get the right change.' 

Other household chores include hoovering, separating our colours from whites and putting on a wash-load and doing the dishes...tasks which leave mum Sarah feeling wracked with guilt. 

'I feel constantly guilty that Lili does so much for me and the other kids,' says Sarah. 'I should be looking after her.'

Sarah says the situation was made worse when she split with her partner Graeme in 2014, quickly plunging Lili into the role as key carer.

Time for fun: Mum Sarah makes sure Lili (above right) is well supported. The eight-year-old is part of a local group for young carers and has access to a counsellor if she needs it 

'She's always been so grown up and capable. Graeme and I decided to split up last year – it's not easy living with someone who's bipolar. He's a good father and the children see him all the time.

'I do worry Lili will end up resenting me one day. I ask her if she wishes she was like her friends, but she just says, "This is my home, you're my mum, why would I want anything else?" I'm lucky to have her.'

In a bid to inject some fun into Lili's life, Sarah ensures that her daughter is as well supported as she can be. She has support from counsellors and is a member of a young carer's club which focuses on enabling Lili and other children in similar situations to kick back and have fun.

So, does Lili worry that she's missing out? The resilient youngster seems to take her demanding role in her stride, saying only that she enjoys spending time with her friends and with her dad. She adds that all she'd really like is to 'make mummy better'. 

'The only time I feel a bit jealous of other kids is when I go to their houses to play and their mums start fetching them crisps and biscuits while they watch TV. I wish I could have more play dates, but it's hard for Mummy to have extra children round.'

'I do like helping Mummy, but I can get fed up sometimes when she keeps sending me up the stairs to fetch nappies or put clothes away. I'll say, "I don't want to", and sometimes she'll say, "It's OK, I'll leave it here and you can do it later."' 

'I never wish I was anyone else. But if there is one thing in the world I could wish for, it would be to make Mummy better.'
