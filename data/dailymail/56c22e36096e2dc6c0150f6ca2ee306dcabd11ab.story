A couple tired of handing over all their cash in mortgage payments have built a home from scratch that's so cheap their living expenses have fallen to just $350 a month - including bills.

Carrie and Shane Caverly from Arizona say they were 'tired of living to work just for someone else' and their new simple life is saving them hundreds of dollars every month.

They've swapped a conventional three-bedroom house for a life on the road with a mobile home which has a floor area of just 204sq/ft - and say its bringing them closer together.

The new pioneers: Tired of handing over all 
their cash in mortgage payments, Carrie and Shane Caverly from Arizona 
have built this tiny home that's so cheap their living expenses have 
fallen to just $350 a month

Simple life: Since there's not much space inside
their new 204sq/ft home the couple also enjoy the great outdoors more 
often, with Mr Caverly saying that whenever the Sun shines he's outside 
soaking it up

Mr Caverly told the New York Daily News: 'I know what it's like to have a big house with a tremendous amount of stuff. This culture of acquiring more is not necessarily a healthy way to live.'

The couple, who have been married since 2009, were spurred to fulfil long-held ambitions to downsize after Mr Caverly lost his home in the banking crisis.

'I ended up having to foreclose,' he told ABC News. 'Now with the market the way it is and everything, I decided I don't want to play that game any more.'

He added to the Daily News: 'I got absolutely tired of it, all the interest I was paying. At that point, I said I’m not going to deal with banks ever again.'

A view through the house takes in the living 
room kitchen AND bedroom: Since Mr Caverly works as a builder, and his 
wife is an architectural designer, the pair had more than enough 
expertise for the build

Creature comforts: Mrs Caverly works on her 
laptop which is resting on a flip out desk attached to her sofa. The 
couple were spurred to fulfil ambitions to downsize after Mr 
Caverly lost his home in the banking crisis

This is where the magic happens: The Caverlys' bedroom is just large enough to fit their queen-sized bed

Efficient use of space: Beneath the bed there is enough room for a wardrobe and even a dog kennel, while the bathroom is little more than a shower with a built-in sink. There is more storage space above the shower unit

Since Mr Caverly works as a building contractor, and his wife is an architectural designer, the pair were had more than enough expertise to make their dream a reality

The Caverly's compact home, which measures just 24ft by eight feet, has been designed with their habits in mind and uses every inch as efficiently as possible.

Their possessions, which they have had to dramatically cull, can be stashed in storage spaces beneath their living room sofa and above their bathroom, which has been so miniaturised it consists of just a shower with a sink inside.

To keep their lifestyles as eco-friendly as possible, the couple collect rainwater from their metal roof and use an incinerating toilet so they don't need their home to be plumbed in.

Since there's not much space inside the couple also enjoy the great outdoors more often, with Mr Caverly saying that whenever the Sun shines he's outside soaking it up.

On the road again: The whole home is built on the back of a trailer and can be towed wherever they want

Seeking adventure: Keen to get closer to the 
untamed wilderness of the Rocky Mountains, the Caverlys recently hitched
their home to a pick up truck and moved from Arizona to Santa Fe, New Mexico

Of course, the real benefit is their dramatically slashed living costs. Land rent, electricty and water for their new home adds up to a paltry $350 (£230) a month, compared to the $1,500 (£980) they paid for their old house.

'I definitely analysed the options,' said Mrs Caverly. 'And if our expenses are $300 a month compared to $1,300 a month we can saive up so much more.'

And though it can get cramped in the winter, compact living has its benefits. 'We can actually probably clean our whole house in about five minutes,' Mr Caverly told ABC.

Moving too, is simple. Keen to get closer to the untamed wilderness of the Rocky Mountains, the Caverlys recently hitched their home to a pick up truck and moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico.

Sensing that there are others who may want to follow them in the simpler life, the Caverlys are now offering replicas of their home for $48,000.
