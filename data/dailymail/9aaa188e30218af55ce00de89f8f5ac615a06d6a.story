Chelsea's pre-season preparations may be well underway, with the squad currently being whipped into shape by Jose Mourinho at their training camp in Austria, but Willian is still on holiday following the World Cup.

And, despite the debacle against Germany, he is in incredibly high spirits judging by his latest Instagram post.

He has snapped himself smiling in sunny Mexico, with a cheeky grin on his face and a dolphin by his side. Little wonder he's in such a good mood again.

Frustrating: He is currently recovering from a disappointing World Cup campaign with Brazil

But, in truth, whilst he may be feeling it as a fan, he can hardly be blamed as a player for Brazil's World Cup performance - despite his missed penalty in the last-16 against Chile.

Even as the likes of Hulk, Fred and Paulinho struggled, Willian's longest stint in game was against Germany, and there was only so much he could do in his 20-minute cameo there with his side already 6-0 down.

In the end, his only start came in the 3-0 defeat to Holland in the third-place play-off, so he should be plenty fresh when he does return from his extended break to the Stamford Bridge fold.
