The reality show American Idol could be sued for racism after NINE black former contestants have mounted a legal challenge amid claims they were forced off the show.

The singers said the production company plotted to remove them from the competition in a bid to boost ratings.

The claims came to light after New York attorney James Freeman asked the U.S. Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission for permission to sue Idol and FOX on behalf of his clients.

Under fire: Producers Nigel Lythgoe and Ken Warwick are facing a legal challenge from nine former black contestants of the show

Contestant Jermaine Jones was confronted by producers after failing to disclose his criminal record

His legal challenge is backed by Jaered Andrews (Season 2), Corey Clark (Season 2), Donnie Williams (Season 3), Terrell Brittenum (Season 5), Derrell Brittenum (Season 5), Thomas Daniels ﻿(Season 6), Akron Watson (Season 6), Ju'Not Joyner (Season 8) and Chris Golightly (Season 9).

The lawyer said he became concerned about the show's treatment of black contestants after competitor Jermaine Jones was disqualified in March last year over an undisclosed criminal record.

An episode of the singing competition saw the 25-year-old confronted with the revelations on camera by two of the show’s executive producers, Nigel Lythgoe and Ken Warwick.

At the time, he told them: 'I was nervous, I didn’t want to get judged. I didn’t want to get penalised for anything that happened in the past.'

But the producers said it was out of their hands, adding: 'We’re not allowed to have anyone with an active warrant against them, and you have four.'

Jones' experience was similar to that of Corey Clark, who was disqualified for hiding his arrest record during the second season in 2003.

Freeman said all of the nine other people who had been publicly disqualified from the show were black.

As part of their application, contestants are asked to disclose whether they had ever been arrested. 

In his letter, Freeman questions whether it was legitimate for producers to ask potential competitors to disclose their criminal records, claiming this violated employment law as applicants were essentially applying for a job.

He added American Idol had humiliated black Idol contestants on national 
TV - making them unfairly appear to be violent criminals, liars and sexual deviants - and creating 'destructive stereotypes'.

Freeman's investigation also claimed the contestants who had been disqualified for their criminal records had not been actually been convicted at the time of their expulsion from the programme.

He said: 'Yet their personal and professional 
lives remain permanently and severely impaired by [the show's] continuing 
violations of our nation's laws.'

Responding to the claims, Mr Lythgoe said he was 'shocked' by what he said were 'ridiculous' allegations.

He told TMZ: 'We treat everybody the same ... 
no matter the race, religion or sex.'

'I think we've always had a 
fantastic share of talent from contestants both black and white ... I don't 
think I've ever seen racism at the show.'
