Samantha Cameron is pressing her husband to do more to help ease the humanitarian disaster caused by the Syrian civil war, it was claimed yesterday.

The Prime Minister’s wife has urged Mr Cameron to act after seeing the plight of refugees fleeing the conflict for herself.

One Cabinet Minister yesterday claimed Mrs Cameron is the ‘biggest explanation’ for his approach to the conflict which has already cost almost 100,000 lives.

Tragic stories: Samantha Cameron talks to a girl who saw her uncle being killed in the street in Syria and helped to bring his body indoors, and her aunt, who was travelling in a car out of Syria when a sniper shot at her car and killed her baby son

Traumatic: Mrs Cameron urged the Prime Minister to act after meeting a Syrian mother whose baby is suffering from a broken leg in a refugee settlement in Lebanon

Mrs Cameron is an ambassador for  Save
 the Children and visited children traumatised by the war in a refugee 
camp in Lebanon in March.

She said at the time: ‘As a mother, it
 is horrifying to hear the harrowing stories from the children I met 
today. No child should ever experience what they have.’

Citing senior government sources, The 
Times reported she had since pushed for a bolder humanitarian response.

It claimed a Cabinet minister had told the newspaper that Mrs Cameron 
was the ‘biggest explanation’ for the prime minister’s stance on Syria, 
regarded to be the most hawkish in Europe.

But one source said the Prime Minister
 himself also ‘got religion’ on Syria when he visited a refugee camp on 
the Jordanian border last year.

And as the Mail reported yesterday, Mr
 Cameron has ditched plans to send arms to the rebels after warnings 
from military commanders that there is little point getting involved 
unless the Prime Minister is prepared for all-out war with the Assad 
regime.

There is far more widespread support 
among ministers for further intervention to deal with the humanitarian 
disaster, which has led to more than 1.5 million Syrians fleeing to 
neighbouring countries.

The Prime Minister’s former spin 
doctor Andy Coulson recently described Mrs Cameron as an asset who 
should be allowed to contribute more widely to strategy sessions. Her 
admirers say she is Mr Cameron’s ‘best focus group’.

Downing Street denies that Mrs Cameron
 has sought to push her husband where he does not want to go on Syria, 
saying that policy is decided by the National Security Council.

The UK has given £348m in humanitarian aid, including food and medical supplies, to those affected by the fighting in Syria.

For some in the Tory party, Samantha Cameron is the secret weapon who could help win husband David the next election.

While
 rarely seen speaking out in public, her influence on her husband - and 
therefore the government's strategy - is significant.

In addition to her influence over Syria, she has played a key role in shaping Tory policy.

Seen
 as a key moderniser, she backed her husband in shifting the 
Conservative positions on climate change, gay rights and humanitarian 
aid.

In particular it 
is said she has warned her husband against focusing too much on the 
importance of marriage if it risks sounding 'anti-single parent'.

When
 Mrs Cameron appears on stage to congratulate her husband at the end of 
conference speeches she does so knowing that some of the key lines 
uttered were her own work.

The
 daughter of Sir Reginald Sheffield, the 8th Baronet Sheffield, she has 
shaken off her aristocratic roots to show she has the common touch.

As
 a student in Bristol she got a dolphin tatooed on her ankle and became 
friends with trip-hop artist Tricky - all a long way from her life 
bringing up a family in the Downing Street.

She has urged the PM to focus on pro-family policies and not obsess about issues which only resonate in the Westminster village.

The
 couple are fiercely protective of the children, Nancy, Arthur and 
Florence - who was born just months after Mr Cameron became PM in May 
2010. Just over a year earlier their six-year-old severely disabled son,
 Ivan, died.

Mrs 
Cameron has secured a broadly positive press since moving into Number 10
 three years ago, largely by keeping below the radar save for charity 
appearances.

But behind 
the scenes her influence is significant, and could prove a strong 
counter-balance to Tory traditionalists demanding a heavy emphasis on 
Europe and welfare.

In May former Tory spin doctor Andy Coulson urged Mr Cameron to listen to his wife.

He said: 'She is one of the few people able to see straight to the heart of a matter and offer a clear, sensible view.'
