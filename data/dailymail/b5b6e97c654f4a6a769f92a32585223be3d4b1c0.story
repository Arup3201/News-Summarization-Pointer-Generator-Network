A baby is fighting for her life after a nurse plunged her into a scalding hot bath, it was reported today.

The mother of 20-month-old Destiny Abdelmalek said her daughter has third-degree burns over 20 per cent of her body.

Miriam Khella, from Livingston, New Jersey, said the skin was falling off her Destiny's feet but instead of calling 911 for help, the nurse hired to care for Destiny dressed her.

Mrs Khella then had to cut the clothes off her child.

'When I carried her, she screamed even more,' she told WABC. 'She started pulling her body away from mine and I knew there was something definitely wrong.

'I looked down at her feet and they were bright red, and there was no skin on them inside the sandals.

'There was no skin, I think the nurse burned my baby. There were bubbles skin coming off on my hand and she was screaming.

'I dialled 911 and was screaming at the nurse, "What did you do, what did you do to her?"'

'She wants me to carry her, I can't, there's nothing I can do for her.'

The child, aged just 20 months, is now fighting for her life in a New Jersey hospital

Vigil: Destiny is being treated at St Barnabas Hospital in Livingston, New Jersey

Destiny is being treated at St Barnabas Hospital in Livingston. Her mother told WABC her lungs are already weak because she was born premature, and doctors fear they could collapse.

She told the station doctors wrapped her hands in gauze, not because they are burned, but because they were pulling on the tubes keeping her alive.

Nurse Ellen Ejimkanye, 30, has charged with aggravated assault, endangering the welfare of a child and child abuse, the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office said.

The prosecutor's office does not believe the scalding was intentional.
