A 16-year-old has been stabbed and left in a pool of blood after a mass brawl outside his school ahead of a GCSE exam.

Police are today questioning two teenagers arrested after the fight close to the gates of St Paul's Catholic School in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire yesterday.

The schoolboy was taken to the town's hospital and is said to be in a stable condition.

Detectives held two teenagers at the scene, and all are still be questioned today.

Students have admitted it is 'scary'  a classmate has been stabbed 'yards away from your school'.

The attack happened on Thursday at around 12.30pm as the victim arrived at school, which was rated as outstanding by Ofsted in 2008, for an exam.

Those in custody were not pupils at the comprehensive, which has nearly 1,200 pupils.

St Paul's headteacher Michael Manley said: 'An incident occurred yesterday afternoon where a pupil who was coming into school for an examination was assaulted on the redway by Phoenix Drive.

'The person who assaulted him was not connected to the school.

'Staff from the school went out quickly to care for the student and the police and ambulance services arrived promptly.

'The student was taken to Milton Keynes Hospital and is in a stable condition.

'We have been reassured that there is no wider threat to other pupils or staff in the school.'
