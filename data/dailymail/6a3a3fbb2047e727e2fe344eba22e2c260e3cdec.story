After scoring a touchdown, Cincinatti Bengals tight end Jermaine Gresham celebrated by throwing the football to a woman in the front row.

But the intended recipient's joy quickly turned to disbelief when a Saints fan plucked the ball from her - and refused to give it back.

And the football player couldn't believe the lack of chivalry either, pointing to the woman to show it had been been meant for her.

The fan, identified as Tony Williams, told the Cincinnatti Enquirer that he had no regrets about his actions.

'It's very simple, I caught the football,' he said. 

But after being shown video of his actions, he said: 'I didn't mean to hit that young lady. I was just reaching for the football.'

Ms Barrett, who came down to the aisle to celebrate, was shocked and said: 'He was not budging at all'

The woman in question, Christa Barrett, who gave up after a few minutes, said: 'He was not budging at all.'

But luckily she didn't go home empty-handed - after Gresham made sure she was given a ball to take home.

He wrote a message to Barrett's sister on Twitter, saying: 'Truly sorry about you guys not getting that ball. I'll make sure you guys receive something greater for compensation.'

Gresham had scored a touchdown in the third quarter of Cincinnati's 27-10 victory against the Saints at the Superdome. 

Ms Barrett and her sister had come down to the aisle to celebrate - at which point he threw the football. 

Gresham was outraged by the incident and pointed to Christa Barrett to show it had been intended for her
