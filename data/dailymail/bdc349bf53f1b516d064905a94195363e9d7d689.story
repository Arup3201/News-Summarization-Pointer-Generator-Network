Google's Glass wearable computer contains just $80 worth of electronic components, a website which took one of the $1500 gadgets apart has found.

The teardown.com site took one of the prototype smart specs, which are a prototype 'explorer edition' designed to help people build apps, apart and posted these amazing images of what goes into Glass.

Google is expected to reveal a cheaper, consumer version later this year.

What goes into Glass: Teardown.com took apart Google's Glass hardware and revealed exactly what goes into it, from the display prism that makes an image appear in front of a wearer's eye to the tiny camera that captures images.

The cost of Glass: The site was able to work out the cost of every component in Glass - which came to a total of $79.78

Originally the Google Glass was only available to 'Explorers' better known as developers.

Finally Google offered a one day sale on April 15, 2014 allowing the general public to purchase the Glass for a $1500 - when teardown.com bought theirs.

They found the single most expensive part inside Glass is a Texas Instruments OMAP 4430 applications processor, which costs $13.96.

There is also a $5.66 camera, a $3 display, and 16GB of NAND flash memory from Toshiba for $8.18, bringing the total to $79.78.

However, the site admits this is just a rough estimate of the cost of the parts.

The site said it will be doing a deeper inspection.

'Now that the Glass is part way through the full Deep Dive Teardown analysis we will have a better understanding of what each component costs,' said Thomas Gallant, a spokesman at the site.

However, a Google spokesperson said the teardown estimate was wrong, according to The Wall Street Journal, and declined to comment further.

The site was also able to identify many of the components used, including the GPS chip, made by Cambridge Silicon (orange), the Wifi control chip (red) and the audio chip (green) that drives the bone conduction speaker in glass, as well as the headphones that can be plugged in.

Glass also has a touchscreen control, shown here, controlled with a Synaptics chip (red)

The Glass Memory, supplied by Toshiba, is shown in red, and a second type of memory from SK Hynix is in Green. Glass has an applications processor chip (orange) and a power management chip as well, along with a special maths chip (yellow)

Earlier this month Google allowed anyone in the US to buy them.

'The number of spots available is limited, so mark your calendar if you want to get in,' the firm said.

Google will also include a free sunglass shade or one of its newly-introduced prescription glasses frames along with any purchase.

Those who currently own the device paid $1,500 to be part of the development process, exchanging ideas on improvements to the design and function in return for the coveted device.

Glass can also clip onto specially developed prescription lenses.

With the release of the second-generation, those already enrolled in the Google Explorer program  were able to 'invite' three of their friends to the scheme.

Reaction to the new design was mixed, with some critics saying changes to the device looked bulky.

Google has come under fire for the unfashionable look of Glass, although has developed its own frames for the system which allow prescription lenses, and partnered with Ray-Ban to develop fashionable frames.

However, the updates were welcomed by those who have a first-generation device, with comments on its Google + page commenting that the changes would improve user experience.

One owner, Dawn Martin, commented: 'My glass has been useless for phone calls and nav because I can't hear it well enough ... yay for updates/upgrades!'

Another fan of the device, Jeremiah Townsend, commented: 'Can't wait ... now that we'll be able to use them with prescription glasses, they'll be glued to my face.'﻿

Others however complained that the device was still not widely available.

Google recently revealed the first official etiquette guide for its Glass wearable computer - and admits users have been seen as 'creepy and rude' for wearing the device.

The firm warns users to ask people's permission before recording them, and warns against 'glassing out' where they focus on the screen too much.

The guide comes as Google is expanding the number of people who have the $1500 prototypes, ahead of an expected release later this year.

'With new technology comes new questions, and our Explorers help to answer those questions,' Google said.

'Since the program started, our Explorers have gotten a lot of attention when they wear Glass out and about.

'Reactions range from the curious – 'Wow! Are those the ‘Google glasses’? How do they work?” – to the suspect – 'Goodness gracious do those things see into my soul?!'

However, the Google Explorer program has been praised for using a clever marketing model where people buy a product at its developmental stage so they can contribute to shaping its design.

'In essence Google has crowdfunded Glass and has shown big business how crowdfunding can be done. In essence it is a giant kickstarter campaign in all but name,' according to Forbes. 

It estimated that Google would have earned about $50 million during the development phase as well as enhancing the desirability of the product.
