A movie fan has told of his delight after discovering a suit belonging to the late Hollywood idol Paul Newman, one of his favourite actors, while rooting around in the basement of his rented apartment.

Peter Gamlen, a 23-year-old British illustrator, discovered the blue two-piece stuffed in a trash bag along with other clothes in the Victorian house in Connecticut.

When he checked the tailor's tag on the inside of the jacket he was stunned to find the name Paul Newman and the date January 1986.

rented apartment in Connecticut

Mr Gamlen, who was given permission by his landlord to sift 
through previous tenants' belongings, then discovered a 
photo of Newman in the pocket of a sports jacket.

The suit was by Henry 
Stewart, so Mr Gamlen researched the tailor and found an obituary in the New 
York Times from 1993 that listed Newman among his clients.

Mr Gamlen, who said 'The Hustler' starring Newman is one of his favorite films, began screaming with delight after making the find and immediately called a friend to boast about the discovery.

Evidence: As well as the actor's name written inside the suit, Mr 
Gamlen also discovered this picture of Newman and three other men in 
the pocket of a sports jacket

'Guess where my legs are!,' he bragged. 'They're in Paul Newman's trousers!'

Mr Gamlen described the suit as a two-piece lounge suit with surgeon's cuffs.

'This is incredibly well made,' said Mr Gamlen, who said he was surprised at how well the suit fit. 'The whole cut of this is absolutely beautiful.'

Newman, who died in 2008, lived in Westport, about 30 miles from New Haven.

Mr Gamlen, who came to the United States for work about a year ago and works in a clothing store, said he believes, at the very least, the suit with the tailor's tag belonged to Newman.

'It's certainly valuable to me in terms of being like an amazing coincidence and also a really beautiful set of clothes that look pretty damn good on me,' he said.

Mr Gamlen said he's not sure what he's going to do with the suit.

Kay Hill, who owns the building, said she has no idea how Newman's clothes could wind up in the basement, though she noted she's had notable tenants over the years such as professors and authors.

'It sounds like it really could have been Paul Newman's suit,' Hill said.

She said her parents, who once lived in the building, met Newman at a Democratic fundraiser decades ago, and her late father in law once played tennis with Newman.

'They wouldn't have anything to do with the suit,' she said.

A.E..Hotchner, Newman's longtime friend, said he could not imagine how Newman's clothes would wind up in New Haven though he didn't rule it out.

And especially fancy suits.

Hustler', Which Mr Gamlen said was one of his favourite films

'Paul was notoriously underdressed,' Hotchner said. 'As far as I remember he had one black sports coat and he had one suit.'

The
down-to-earth actor who liked to race cars also had a tuxedo, but he 
burned it so he'd have an excuse not to attend any more black tie 
events, Hotchner said.

'Paul
really didn't want anything to do with any kind of dressing up,' 
Hotchner said. "He certainly wouldn't have left any clothes in a 
building in New Haven.'

Newman's
daughter, Nell, also said she's not sure why her father would have old 
clothes sitting around in New Haven, though she noted he briefly 
attended Yale University in the city.
