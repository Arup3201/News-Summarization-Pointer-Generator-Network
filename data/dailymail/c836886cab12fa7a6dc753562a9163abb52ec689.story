A ferret had a lucky escape after a refuse collector spotted him inside a wheelie bin just moments before its contents were about to get crushed.

Darren Chandler, 30, was about to empty the bin into the back of a refuse lorry when he suddenly saw something moving among the bin bags.

He rummaged inside and pulled out the terrified before putting him into a box to take it to a local animal shelter.

Lucky escape: Darren Chandler was about to throw the contents of a bin into a refuse lorry when he spotted a ferret inside

Mr Chandler said: 'I just lifted the lid on the black bin before hooking it up to the dustbin lorry, like I do with all the bins.

'Then I spotted something moving. I realised it was a little ferret and got one of my colleagues to fetch a box so I could take it to Wood Green.'

The Ferret has been nicknamed Flint after Flint Road, Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, where he had his lucky escape.

Flint is now being cared for by staff at nearby Wood Green animal shelter in Godmanchester who hope to find him a new home.

Home sweet home: Mr Chandler took the ferret to the Wood Green animal shelter in Godmanchester, Cambridgeshire, where he is being cared for until staff find him a new home

Marie Channer, the shelter's small animal welfare manager, said: 'It's not uncommon for ferrets to be find their way into bins and skips to find food.

'However, if it wasn't for Darren, there is a chance Flint wouldn't be with us today.

'This little boy is very friendly and so we believe he once belonged to a family.

'Unfortunately nobody has come forward for him and he isn't microchipped, so we haven't been able to reunite him with an owner.'

The charity said it currently had 25 ferrets looking for new owners.

Nickname: The ferret was name Flint after Flint Lane, Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, where he was found
