QPR

QPR are hoping defender Darnell Furlong, midfielder Adel Taarabt and forward Eduardo Vargas will recover in time for Saturday's Premier League match at Crystal Palace.

Furlong (calf), Taarabt (groin) and Vargas (muscular problem) returned to training this week after missing last weekend's 2-1 home defeat to Tottenham through injuries. The trio will have to pass a late fitness test on Friday afternoon before club coach Chris Ramsey decides to select them.

Midfielder Joey Barton will serve his third and final match ban this weekend while defender Richard Dunne and midfield pair Leroy Fer and Alejandro Faurlin are still sidelined with knee problems.

Provisional squad: Green, McCarthy, Caulker, Furlong, Yun, Ferdinand, Onuoha, Isla, Hill, Traore, Taarabt, Kranjcar, Henry, Sandro, Phillips, Hoilett, Wright-Phillips, Vargas, Austin, Zamora, Zarate.
