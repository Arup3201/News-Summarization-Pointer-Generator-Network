Three men have been arrested after a group of students fell ill after taking an illegal hallucinogenic drug they bought on the internet.

One of the six men - all aged between 19 and 22 - remains in a critical condition following the incident at a terraced house in Jesmond a suburb of Newcastle.

The group of students, some from Newcastle University, were found at 3am early yesterday having taken 2CB, which is similar to ecstasy.

Raid: Raid: Police are investigating after six students were rushed to hospital after taking the illegal hallucinogenic drug 2CB

Some eight people were at the house 
when officers arrived and neighbours said they heard revellers coming 
and going into the early hours.

Five people who were treated at the 
Royal Victoria Infirmary have now been discharged but a sixth remained 
critically ill, Northumbria Police said.

Officers have now arrested a third man on suspicion of supplying the drug. The 20-year-old remains in police custody.

Last night Northumbria Police said two 23-year-olds had been arrested and bailed pending further inquiries.

A Northumbria Police spokesman said: 'Enquiries to establish exactly 
what happened continue, with officers warning people about the dangers 
of taking any illegal drugs - especially those bought over the 
internet.'

Newcastle University has circulated a warning about 2CB via an email to students.

It appears there may have been a party at
the terraced house in Ripon Gardens, a street popular with students at 
the elite university.

Bev Faulder, a teaching assistant, 
said: ‘I heard them running around, shouting and carrying on. We’ve had a
lot of trouble with noise at night but they are a lovely bunch of lads 
when you see them during the day and I hope they’re all right.’

A total of eight people were at the property when officers arrived at about 3am during an apparent party at the house

Another, who did not want to be named, said: ‘I couldn’t sleep because there was a lot of noise. At around 2am I heard some taxis coming and going. There was a lot of boys’ banter.’

In November last year, the government banned mexxy and black mamba and made class B drugs.

Mexxy, which is sold as an 
alternative to ketamine was linked to two deaths and police have warned 
of the 'life-threatening effects' of black mamba.

A record 57 new legal highs were detected last year alone.

An European Union report said it had found that more than one new psychoactive drug went on the market every week.

Drug experts say while cocaine, ecstasy and amphetamines are the main players for those taking stimulants across Europe, they are now competing with a growing number of emerging synthetic drugs.

A third added: ‘I thought they were that sort of thing because there were often strange smells coming from the house.’

2CB is a Class A drug which often comes in purple capsules and is an hallucinogen related to ecstasy popular in Europe.

It is also sold as white powder or small pills and is particularly dangerous when mixed with other substances.

On the street, it is also known as Bromo, Nexus, CB, Performax, Spectrum, Venus, Erox or Cloud Nine.

A team of ten police officers were seen searching the house and appeared to be looking in the drains.

A
Northumbria police spokesperson said: ‘At this stage police believe 
they have taken an hallucinogenic drug called 2CB which at this stage is
believed has been bought over the internet.

‘The exact reason for hospitalisation 
is unclear at present and could be due to a suspected overdose or mixing
the drug with another substance, or a bad reaction.’

Neighbours said they had heard revellers coming and going from the house into the early hours

Officers are now warning students and other young people to beware the dangers of illegal drugs - especially those bought over the internet.

The relevant course heads at Newcastle University are understood to have been notified.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
