Whitey Bulger is one of the most hardened criminals in America but it has been revealed that a note from his longtime girlfriend brought him to tears.

The Boston mobster had a message passed along to Catherine Grieg via his lawyer, who shuffled the note from Bulger's Massachusetts jail to the Rhode Island jail where Grieg is currently serving time.

Attorney J.W. Carney offered his legal pad to Bulger, and Bulger wrote a note that Carney hand-delivered to Greig at the detention center where she was serving time for helping Bulger evade authorities.

The Boston Globe reports that she wept as she read and wrote a reply, which also made Bulger cry.

He told Carney that one of his greatest regrets was never marrying Greig.

Carney says the exchange was not illegal but did not reveal what the note said, nor did he read it himself.

'To me there is no regulation or law that should prevent people from expressing love,' Carney said at a meeting of the Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.

This is not the first time that Bulger expressed his love for Grieg, as he recounted their good tims together in earlier jailhouse letters.

'My 16 years on the run were the happiest years of my life and hers. Memories sustain me,' he wrote in the letter.

'If I met Catherine at a younger age I would have had a better life. She was the best thing that ever happened to me.'

Greig began dating Bulger sometime in the 1970s and lived together in Boston before they went on the run in 1995.

After being caught by authorities by Bulger's side in their adopted apartment in Santa Monica, California in 2011, she was recently tried and found guilty of harboring a fugitive. She is now serving an eight-year prison sentence.

Bulger does not appear to be settling for his life sentence, as he writes that he is 'getting things together for appeal'.

'Jail and prisons are a dead end,' he said in the letter obtained by Radar.com. It is unclear who the intended recipient was meant to be.

'I expect the worst is yet to come — I’ll deal with it and welcome the "peace,"' the 83-year-old convict wrote.

'Will be busy but will write you again later on — You could do me a favor. Stay out of trouble and avoid entanglement in this. Meet a nice girl and enjoy life + appreciate freedom.'

His and her sentences: Bulger faces a life sentence plus up to 30 years and Greig faces eight years behind bars

In another jailhouse letter, Bulger wrote how he finds Greig has been inappropriately sentenced, as her eight years is a larger sentence than many of the fellow mobsters who testified against him in trial.

Writing that ‘her sentence is a crime,’ Mr Bulger said, signing the letter 'Inmate No. 1428AZ,' the same prisoner number he was issued during his early 1960s stay at Alcatraz.

‘More time + fine than people who confessed to murder and made deal to testify against me for the gov and in return set free after short sentence. They told the gov what it wanted to hear and were rewarded.'

Of the former Winter Hill gang henchmen Mr Bulger is referring to, one is likely Stephen ‘The Rifleman’ Flemmi – a confessed murderer who pulled his victims’ teeth out to prevent identification, had a sexual relationship with his stepdaughter and lured her to a home where Mr Bulger allegedly strangled her to death, according to his testimony during Bulger’s long-awaited trial.
