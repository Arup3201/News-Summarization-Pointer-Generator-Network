A new time-lapse video is giving a fascinating snapshot of life in the Big Apple from the viewpoint of a cyclist.

The four-minute video captures New York's frenetic pace and its appeal as cyclist and blogger Michael Green pedals past landmarks and attractions in Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn.

Mr Green had a camera attached to his helmet as he cycled the 12-mile route over the Brooklyn, Manhattan and Williamsburg bridges and through the two boroughs' streets.

Scenic: Michael Green cycles through New York in a new time-lapse video in collaboration with Virgin Atlantic

The cycling tour begins at City Hall and continues over the iconic Brooklyn Bridge, which was opened in 1883.

Mr Green then makes his way into Downtown Brooklyn and past Borough Hall which was formerly Brooklyn City Hall. 

After passing through Downtown Brooklyn, Mr Green crosses the East River and returns to Manhattan via the Williamsburg Bridge.

He returns to Brooklyn using the Manhattan Bridge's dedicated cycling path and finishes his journey on the riverfront at the base of the Brooklyn Bridge. 

Cycle lanes: Mr Green uses a number of cycle lanes during the four minute video

Junctions: The cyclist also cycles along a number of junctions 

Finish: The cyclist finishes the cycle on the promenade overlooking the recognisable New York City skyline

The video is a collaboration between Virgin Atlantic, urban tour guide Nick Reale and Mr Green.

It is intended to bring attention to sightseeing tours and promote New York as a cyclist-friendly destination.

Since 2007 New York has built over 30 miles of protected bike lanes.
