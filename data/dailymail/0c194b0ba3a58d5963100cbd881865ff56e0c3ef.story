A woman whose mother died of breast cancer has become the first in Britain to take preventative medication to reduce her risk of developing the disease.

The innovative treatment could now be offered to thousands more women after new guidelines were announced yesterday aimed at protecting those most at risk of breast cancer.

Charlotte Stockton, from Altrincham, started taking tamoxifen in summer 2011 at the age of 35 because of her family history of the illness.

She was healthy and had no signs of cancer but decided to take part in the trial at the Genesis Prevention Centre in Manchester to minimise her chances of falling victim.

Miss Stockton's mother, Patti, died from the illness 20 years ago aged only 44, so she feared that she, too, could be vulnerable.

When Miss Stockton, who is now 36, discovered two benign lumps, it gave her the impetus to sign up for the pioneering treatment.

She was referred to the Genesis Centre where tests revealed she had a high risk of developing the cancer.

But doctors say her risk of developing breast cancer has been minimised by taking part in the preventative medication study.

Miss Stockton is one of 136 healthy women taking a daily tamoxifen pill for five years as part of the clinic's research.

The drug, which blocks the uptake of the hormone oestrogen by cancer cells, stopping them multiplying, is normally given to women with the illness to reduce their risk of the cancer recurring.

But research has shown it can reduce the risk of breast cancer by 70 per cent when used as a preventative medication.

International trials showed its preventative effects could last up to 20 years.

Powerful drugs: Tamoxifen may now be used to prevent breast cancer

Yesterday the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) suggested women at risk of developing breast cancer should be offered the powerful preventative drugs raloxifene (Evista) or tamoxifen (Nolvadex, Istubal or Valodex).

Even those judged to be at 'moderate' risk could be given daily medication for five years before or after the mediation in what has been hailed an 'historic step' in the history of treating breast cancer.

NICE, the watchdog that advises the NHS on best practice, said it was recommending the drugs because there was 'good evidence' to show they worked in a preventative capacity.

Breast cancer specialist Professor Michael Baum said the drugs were a 'reasonable option' for women at high risk because of evidence that they cut the death rate.

He said ‘I don’t think women or doctors will be deterred from using them by the lack of a licence.

‘NICE's support for preventive drugs could encourage clinicians, it will give them more confidence when talking to women at high risk about their options.'

Miss Stockton, an academic health researcher who lives with her partner Joanne, 39, said: 'It was obviously very hard losing my mum at the age of 15 and the memories of her illness have stayed with me even though I was very young.

'When I was told about the trial and asked to take part, it was a no-brainer.

'Anything to reduce my risk of breast cancer can only be a good thing, so I didn't have to think twice.

'I've been on the trial for a year and a half and I'm very happy with it: tests have shown that I'm cancer-free.

'It's great that this trial is leading the way nationally.'

One in 10 women in Britain will develop breast cancer, and studies have shown a strong genetic link.

The disease is the most common cancer in the UK with around 50,000 women and 400 men diagnosed with the condition each year.

Women with faulty genes such as BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53 are among those who have a more than 80 per cent chance of being diagnosed with the disease.

Professor Tony Howell, research director at Genesis, said: 'The first patient to be treated with tamoxifen was treated at The Christie in 1969 so Manchester has a long history of leading the way in breast cancer research and treatments.

'Our studies have shown that it can help to reduce the risk of breast cancer by 70 per cent in some women so I welcome the draft guidance by NICE with open arms.'

The hormonal drug tamoxifen has been a mainstay of breast cancer treatment for 30 years.

It halves the chances of the disease returning or affecting the other breast and reduces the risk of dying from it.

The drug is used for five years after surgery and works in breast cancers stimulated by the hormone oestrogen. Prevention trials show it cuts the chances of developing the disease by 30 to 40 per cent.

Tamoxifen can be used in women before the menopause, unlike some newer drugs, as well as afterwards.

According to Macmillan Cancer Support, possible side effects include hot flushes, nausea, indigestion, weight gain and leg cramps.

Less common side effects can include depression, tiredness, headaches, blood clots, vision problems, voice changes and, in rare cases, womb cancer.

Tamoxifen is still used by thousands of patients although newer, more effective drugs called aromatase inhibitors have become more important.

Raloxifene, which is prescribed for thinning bones, halves the chances of developing invasive breast cancer and has fewer side effects than tamoxifen.

It is not allowed as a first-choice treatment on the NHS but is an alternative if patients can't tolerate cheaper drugs.
