Liverpool have completed the £9.8m transfer of Emre Can from Bayer Leverkusen.

The Reds agreed a deal in principle for the versatile midfielder last month, and the necessary documentation has now been finalised.

Signal of intent: Manager Brendan Rodgers has been busy trying to sort incomings out early on for next year

Upon sealing the switch to Anfield, 
the 20-year-old told the club website: 'I am proud to be a part of the family and I am 
looking forward to playing here. I will give it my best.

'LFC
 is a great club and the fans are amongst the best in the world. I am 
looking forward to the first game and can't wait to step on the pitch 
for the first time at Anfield.

'I want to thank the manager for trusting me and allowing me to play here. I am proud to be a part of the family and I am looking forward to playing here.

'It was an easy decision for me to sign with Liverpool as I had a very good chat with the manager, which clearly shows that he and the club wanted to sign me.

'I want to give it my best and help the team as much as I can. I believe this season the team finished second in the league, so i want to be a Premier League champion next season.'

He also discussed his ambition to play in the Champions League, signalling that it was a key factor behind his decision to move, adding: 'Playing in the Champions League is a dream come true for every footballer.

'I have a total of seven appearances now and these sort of matches are not comparable to any other games.

'I hope we will progress as far as we can and I am looking to compete against the best teams in Europe. I believe we will play a good role in next year's competition.'

Ambition: Can is hoping to make a big impact in next season's Champions League

The boot room: He has spoken of his enthusiasm at playing for the club

Can
 made 29 Bundesliga appearances last season, scoring three goals for 
Leverkusen, in addition to seven Champions League run-outs.

And
 Brendan Rodgers is delighted to have brought him to the club, telling 
Liverpoolfc.com: 'Emre is an exciting young talent and I'm delighted 
he's chosen Liverpool for the next phase of his development and growth 
as a player.'

'He has 
recognised that we are a club that improves and nurtures exciting, 
ambitious players and I'm looking forward to seeing him take those next 
steps forward for us.

'We 
have tracked his progress for some time and I have been impressed with 
his attitude and qualities when I have seen him play both in the German 
Bundesliga and the Champions League.

'He has many of the attributes we look for; charisma on the football pitch and courage to want the ball and make things happen.'

Can was one of the most versatile young players in the Bundesliga.

Having spent most of his career so far in the youth set up at Bayern Munich, the Frankfurt-born player was one pipped for the top from an extremely early age.

After only four first-team appearances at Bayern, though, Can's star faded during the 2012/13 season, and so in the summer of 2013 he chose to make the switch to Leverkusen.

It has done him a world of good, and he has developed into an invaluable midfield force for his new club. He has also represented Germany at every level from Under 15 to Under 21.

Can prefers to play in central midfield - 'either attacking or defending, I don't care either way' - but has been employed as a centre-back and a left-back on various occasions.

As captain of the German Under 17s team, he was the calming influence at the heart of play. His physical strength is of particular use going forward, though he is rarely overly reckless.

It has been remarked on several occasions that Can seems to have a maturity beyond his years, and his technical ability as a playmaker, either from the back or the front, is now beyond doubt.

The most commonly drawn comparison is Bastian Schweinsteiger. And not only because the young Can puts as much effort into his hairstye as Schweinsteiger once did.

His ability to switch effortlessly from defence to midfield, his dangerous shot, and his control over the pace of the game all do remind one of the established Bayern star.

For those watching his marauding runs through the centre at Leverkusen this season though, Toni Kroos has always also sprung to mind.

It is little surprise that these two Bayern stars have had an influence on Can's play. He has trained with them, or at least in close proximity to them, for several of his formative years.
