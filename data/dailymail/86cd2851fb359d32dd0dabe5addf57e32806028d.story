Dave Whelan was the victim of an embarrassing gaffe in his final programme notes as Wigan chairman.

The 78-year-old businessman handed over control of the relegation-threatened club to his grandson this week after 20 years at the helm.

But in his last written address to fans, he started by welcoming the supporters and staff of Cardiff City - when Wigan were actually playing Leeds!

Cardiff are the last club of Wigan's current boss Malky Mackay - he was sacked by them in December 2013.

And the Scot is currently under investigation by the Football Association amidst allegations of sending racist, sexist and homophobic text messages while in charge at Cardiff.

Whelan started his programme notes by saying: 'Welcome to the DW Stadium for our second home match in five days.

'Tonight we welcome Cardiff City and their supporters who have travelled from South Wales for another important Sky Bet Football League Championship fixture.'

Shortly before kick-off, Whelan strode onto the pitch to deliver an emotional final address to the fans in person.

Whelan was given a standing ovation by the home supporters then walked alone to the centre-spot with a microphone in hand.

'Thank you for everything,' he said. 'For the last 20 years, you have been magnificent supporters.

'We all remember when we first played at Springfield Park and I bought the club and we were third from bottom of the old fourth division.

'With your support, and all the players and staff we build this stadium and fought our way up to the Premier League.

'We had eight fantastic years in the Premier League and two years ago we brought the FA Cup back to Wigan.'

At this point, the large travelling contingent from Leeds began barracking Whelan. But he responded with a put-down which brought raucous applause from the home fans.

'Leeds have not won the cup for 25 years,' he added. 'However, everyone from Leeds we welcome you to Wigan. You are a great club and a great bunch of supporters.

'I am still going to be the greatest supporter Wigan has and I will be at every match I can get to.

'Thank you for every single thing and all your fabulous support.'

Whelan said he is still going to be the 'greatest supporter Wigan has' and will be at every match he can get to
