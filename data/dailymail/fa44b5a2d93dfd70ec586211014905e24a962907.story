Trial date: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will face a court in November

A trial date for Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was set for November 3 at a hearing on Wednesday, despite objections from his attorneys.

The date is nearly a year earlier than the team representing the 20-year-old had requested, as they argued for more time to build a defense.

Tsarnaev, who has pleaded not guilty to 30 federal counts including one involving a weapon of mass destruction, could face the death penalty if convicted of the attack in April last year, which killed three people.

The suspected bomber did not appear at the hearing, but several of the 260 people injured in the attack, including Marc Fucarile, did attend.

Prosecutors allege that Tsarnaev and
 his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, built and planted two pressure cooker 
bombs near the finish line of the marathon last April.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev
 died following a shootout with police several days later.

Prosecutors had pushed for an earlier trial date, and U.S. District Judge George O'Toole said the proposed date was 'realistic and fair'.

The defense had asked for the trial to take place no earlier than September 2015.

Mr Fucarile, who lost his right leg above the knee in the attack, said he wished the trial would start even earlier.

'Why not?' he said. 'Everybody should be on the same page … It’s pretty cut and dried with the evidence. Don’t waste anybody’s time.'

Defense attorney Judy Clarke, one of the country’s leading death penalty specialists, complained that prosecutors have been 'sluggish' in turning over evidence to her team.

In particular, she cited 2,000 pieces of physical evidence at an FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, that the defense hasn’t been able to examine yet.

'It’s not the defense dragging its feet. We’re really struggling with getting access to evidence,' she said.

Ms Clarke said it was doubtful the defense could get experts to review the items before this summer, which would make a November trial date 'virtually impossible'.

She said the defense has a 'tremendous amount' of work to do to compile information on Tsarnaev’s family history.

The family lived in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan and came to the U.S. about a decade ago from the Dagestan region of Russia.

'There’s just a tremendous amount of logistical hurdles,' she said.

Judge O’Toole did not agree to change the trial date, but he did order prosecutors to compile a list of the items in Quantico for Tsarnaev’s lawyers by the end of the week.

The judge scheduled another court hearing for June 18.
