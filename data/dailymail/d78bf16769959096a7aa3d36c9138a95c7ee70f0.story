It may not be in the training manual for fire fighters – how to free a bull stuck in a well – but these emergency workers somehow knew exactly what to do.

Practising the simple rules of physics, it seems someone had paid enough attention in class to know that if you fill the well, the bull will rise.

The bull had fallen into a deep well in a field in Xishui County, Hubei Province, China - a seemingly impossible place for the beast to be pulled from.

Simple physics: Chinese firefighters worked quickly and cleverly to save this bull, filling the well with water as the bull floated to the top

But the crafty Chinese firemen knew exactly what to do, using a pump to fill the well and rescue the helpless bull from certain death.

Zhang Xigui, the bull’s owner had herded the bull into a local field that morning only to find it missing when he returned later that day.

To his horror, Mr Xigui followed the bull's panicked cries to the deep well where it was trapped, looking up longingly at its master from the well's bottom far below.

Happy reunion: After the bull was pulled from the well, it was reunited with relieved owner Zhang Xigui

He said: ‘I was very anxious until I heard the bull's sound in the well.’

Mr Xigui called firefighters for help and just 30 minutes later they had filled the well with water allowing the bull to rise to the surface, kicking furiously to stay afloat and make it out unharmed.

Mr Xigui said: ‘It's really smart. Without them, I really don't know how to take this giant one out.’

Thankful owner: Mr Xigui was amazed by his bull's lucky escape because when he found the beast he had no idea 'take this giant one out'
