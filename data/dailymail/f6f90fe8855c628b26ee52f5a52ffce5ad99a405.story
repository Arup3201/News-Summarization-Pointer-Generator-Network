Team news

Leicester 

Jamie Vardy and Marc Albrighton are injury doubts for Leicester ahead of their Barclays Premier League return against Everton at the King Power Stadium.

Striker Vardy, who scored 16 goals last season to help the Foxes clinch the Championship title and end the club's decade-long absence from the top flight, has a thigh strain while midfielder Albrighton, a summer arrival from Aston Villa, is nursing a groin problem.

Anthony Knockaert has had an ankle injury recently but the French winger is expected to be fit while Matt Upson's ankle injury will rule him out.

Provisional squad: Schmeichel, Hamer, De Laet, Konchesky, Wasilewski, Schlupp, Moore, Morgan, King, Drinkwater, Hammond, James, Albrighton, Knockaert, Mahrez, Vardy, Taylor-Fletcher, Ulloa, Nugent, Wood.

Everton

Everton manager Roberto Martinez will make late decisions on the fitness of Seamus Coleman, Kevin Mirallas and Romelu Lukaku ahead of their Premier League opener at Leicester.

Right-back Coleman sustained a hamstring injury in a friendly against Tranmere at the end of July while forwards Mirallas and Lukaku are a couple of weeks behind the rest of the squad in terms of overall fitness having returned to pre-season later after the World Cup.

Just short of fitness: Romelu Lukaku (centre) stated pre-season training late for Everton following Brazil 2014

Striker Arouna Kone, out since October with a knee injury, will not be fit for another month.

Provisional squad: Howard, Coleman, Distin, Jagielka, Baines, Barry, McCarthy, Osman, Pienaar, Barkley, Lukaku, Robles, Hibbert, Stones, Alcaraz, Gibson, Besic, McGeady, Naismith, Atsu.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

The Foxes have won none of their last five fixtures on the opening weekend of the Premier League (D3 L2).

Not since the opening game of the 2009/10 Premier League season has Roberto Martinez enjoyed a victory on the first weekend, drawing two and losing two since then with Everton and Wigan.

Everton are unbeaten in their last nine Premier League clashes with the Foxes, although they have won just two of those games (D7).

11 of the 16 Premier League games between Everton and Leicester have been drawn (69 per cent) making it the highest percentage of draws in Premier League history of any fixture that has been played more than 10 times.

Everton have lost three of their last five Premier League games (W2 L3).

It’s been over three years since Romelu Lukaku scored a competitive goal for a club that owned him (August 5th 2011 for Anderlecht).

Leicester City won more games (17) and points (55) at home than any other side in the 2013-14 Championship.

David Nugent has averaged a goal every 399 mins in the Premier League (nine goals in 64 apps), a significantly slower rate than he has managed in the second tier (a goal every 217 mins).

Leighton Baines (49) and Seamus Coleman (45) created more goalscoring chances than any other defenders in the Premier League last season.

The Foxes scored the most goals (52) and conceded the fewest number of goals (15) in the second half of games in the Championship last season.
