Having a bad memory for faces is a common problem.

But sisters Donna Jones and Victoria Wardley have had to cope all their lives without recognising anyone – even themselves.

Despite having normal eyesight the women suffer from an extreme form of 'face blindness.'

Sisters Victoria Wardley (left) and Donna Jones (right) suffer from from prosopagnosia, a rare condition which makes them unable to recognise the faces of anyone around them

It means they do not recognise their 
own faces in the mirror, do not know each other when they meet, cannot 
recall their partners' features and when they were children they 
routinely had to recognise their parents by their clothing.

Their condition, prosopagnosia, has been known for decades, although little is understood about how it is caused.

It appears the sisters from York never
developed the visual mechanisms in the brain required for face 
processing and simply cannot do something we all take for granted.

Mrs Wardley, 32, cannot describe what 
her husband Matthew's face looks like. She said: 'I can make out an eye 
or a nose, but when I try and look at a whole face it just doesn't work.
It's like a blank canvas on someone's head.

The sisters have suffered with the condition their whole lives but were only diagnosed a few years ago. Pictured Victoria (back) with Donna (right) and their brother

'People will come up to me who I've known for years, but until they introduce themselves I have no idea who they are.'

She was diagnosed by chance a few 
years ago when her doctor came into the coffee shop where she worked and
she failed to recognise him.

Her 30-year-old sister then realised she also had the condition, which can run in families.

Miss Jones, an office worker with a 
14-year-old daughter, Rebecca, said: 'I'd always thought I just wasn't 
paying enough attention, so in a way it was a relief to know that 
something was wrong.

'I even find it hard to pick out my daughter from a crowd.

'I feel guilty – I should know what my own child looks like – but I just find it impossible.'

It certainly makes her relationship 
with partner Paul Williams, 40, a bit different. She said: 'When I saw 
him for the first time I immediately thought that he looked like a 
lovely person, and every time I look at him I still get that feeling.'

Growing up, the sisters found ways to 
recognise their parents.

The condition is so bad that the sisters, from Yorkshire, are unable to recognise even their own reflections

The condition means that the sisters rarely go out alone together, for fear of losing each other

Miss Jones said: 'My mum wore bright neon 
colours all the time, and she always made my dad wear homemade knitted 
jumpers so it was easy to spot them in a crowd. Dad had waist-length 
hair too.'

However, on one hiking trip when 
everyone was wearing similar outdoor clothing, the younger sister walked
off with the wrong family.

The biggest problem comes in 
recognising themselves. Miss Jones recalled stepping from side to side 
repeatedly to avoid a woman in a corridor only to discover she was 
trying to walk into a mirror.

And while Mrs Wardley was a bar 
manager, she shouted at a woman standing in her way as she carried empty
glasses and realised she was arguing with her own reflection.
