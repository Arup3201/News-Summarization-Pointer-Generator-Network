Mesut Ozil looks set to start against Brazil despite mounting criticism of the Germany midfielder in his homeland.

Former international Paul Breitner is the latest name to call for Arsenal’s £42.5million record signing to be axed.

Disappointing: Mesut Ozil has failed to impress for Germany at the World Cup

In: German newspaper Bild called for Ozil to be left out against France but he started the quarter-final win

Criticism: Former German international Paul Breitner (pictured) had called for Ozil to be dropped

The ex-Bayern Munich and Real Madrid 
star scythed: ‘If Joachim Low is brave and says that he doesn't want to 
play with just ten players, he will leave Mesut Ozil out of the next 
match.

‘It would be a step towards the World Cup title and above all a step forward for the team.

‘Nine players go out there and give everything for 90 minutes and one other does nothing but walk around on the pitch.

'At a World Cup, that can't happen. Joachim Low has to come out of his shadow and give a reaction.’

Leading German newspaper Bild had last week called for Ozil to be replaced by Andre Schurrle for the quarter-final clash with France.

Ozil, though, kept his place for the 1-0 victory and again failed to impress.

But Low is likely to ignore those who have questioned the 25-year-old’s contribution and name him in the starting XI for Tuesday’s last-four meeting with the hosts.
