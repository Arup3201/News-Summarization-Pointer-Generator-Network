At least 20 people are dead and another seven are missing after flooding struck south China's Guangdong Province, it has been reported.

The National Disaster Reduction Commission has dispatched a working group to Guangdong to help with disaster relief work.

The area was disrupted by Typhoon Utor 
earlier this week with high winds and heavy rainfall triggering flooding
 and mountain torrents.

The typhoon seemed to subside on Thursday, with local reports suggesting it turned into more of a tropical storm in the province in south China.

Reports today however suggest further devastation after twenty people have died and another seven are missing after the area was struck by floods, rainstorms and landslides.

The damage is not isolated to 
Guangdong province however with devastation caused in Liaoning Province 
too. Fifteen people were killed and 32 went missing after Utor tore 
through the area earlier this week.

Typhoon
 Utor is the 11th and strongest to strike China this year, disrupting 
more than four million lives in Guangdong province alone.

Its devastation has forced the closure of schools, offices and construction sites across China.

The financial centre in Hong Kong closed its doors in anticipation of the large scale storm which claimed at least seven lives in the Philippines last week.

Residents of Nankou Qian County in Fushun City have also been severely affected by flooding with 15 people dead and 32 missing.

364,300 people in the northeast province of Liaoning were afflicted by the damage.

Tens
 of thousands of people were evacuated earlier this week as the typhoon 
made its way to China from the Philippines after sinking a cargo ship.

Crew
 members from the Trans Summer were rescued by helicopter after the bulk
 carrier started listing in waters in the southwest of Hong Kong.

It is not known exactly how many lives Typhoon Utor has claimed since its formation.

The
 natural disaster agency said last week 'it accelerated and intensified 
slightly' after tearing through the Philippines, before making its way 
across the South China sea.
