World Cup winner Kaka has backed strikers Fred and Jo to fire Brazil to victory but admits the current strike force are not Ronaldo and Romario.

With Brazil having boasted some of the greatest frontmen of all-time, the current attacking duo of Fred and Jo have scored just once so far at this summer's tournament.

However, Kaka believes the pair will come good as Brazil search for World Cup glory.

Left out: Kaka missed out on Luis Felipe Scoalri's 23-man Brazil squad for this summer's tournament

Speaking to reporters on Friday, Kaka said: 'I don't think Brazil does not have good strikers nowadays.

'I think Romario and Ronaldo were on another level; they were 
another step up.

'I think Fred and Jo are good players, they are players who capable of being in 
the Brazil squad.'

'Fred had a wonderful Confederations Cup last year. He did not start 
this World Cup very well but he has already scored once and I think he 
can be crucial and can help Brazil a lot.'

Kaka has also praised Chelsea's Oscar, a player who has often been compared to the Milan legend.

The Blues midfielder, who scored Brazil's third goal in the opening game victory over Croatia, has impressed Kaka, who was left out of Luiz Felipe Scolari's 23-man squad.

'Oscar has shown that he's very important to the Brazil squad,' Kaka said.

'I was really happy with his first game and with his goal. And with regards to him being like me; even I think that we have different skills. That's because he is a player who knows his role, always looking for the goal and he also supports the team in other ways.'

Meanwhile, the 32-year-old has denied rumours he is set to leave AC Milan for a move to the United States or his homeland Brazil.

'I'm not leaving AC Milan,' said Kaka. 'Every year, you (the media) speculate a lot about my future. It is part of my history, every year there is so much speculation. '

'So the only thing for certain and that is official, is that on July 9 I will return to Milan.'
