The Premier League has never been richer, with the most recent combined annual income for the current 20 clubs soaring past £3billion for the first time. But a review of the books by the Mail on Sunday also shows club debts standing at more than £2.5 billion.

Much of that poses no imminent danger to the clubs encumbered with it. Chelsea’s parent company owes Roman Abramovich £958million, for example, and he is showing no sign of demanding it back any time soon.

Manchester United have debts of £342m as a result of the leveraged takeover almost 10 years ago by the Glazers but can service it comfortably, while Arsenal have ‘good debt’ of £241m, borrowed to fund their stadium. Taking their cash pile into consideration they had only £33m of net debt at the end of the last financial year.

West Bromwich Albion, on the other hand, are nearly debt-free after being sensibly run over a long period

But a group of clubs including Aston Villa, Hull, Leicester, Newcastle, Queens Park Rangers and West Ham have each racked up debt of around £100m, much of which is owed to their owners. And in an era when the Premier League has never had so much cash it is bewildering so many clubs remain financially unstable and potentially in peril should they get relegated.

The ‘boom-and-bust culture’ of unsustainable spending in an attempt to buy success underpins the phenomenon, according to the chief executive of one of the clubs most sensibly run over a long period, West Bromwich Albion.

‘The easiest thing to do when you reach the Premier League is over-reach,’ says Albion’s Mark Jenkins, whose club have just posted their latest set of profitable accounts and are close to being debt-free.

West Brom played Harry Redknapp's Portsmouth in the 2008 FA Cup - a team guilty of 'boom and bust'

‘Everyone puts you under enormous pressure to just chuck endless money at it,’ he adds. ‘You’ve got to be strong enough to withstand that pressure and the flak that comes with it if you don’t have the spending level.

‘You can get sucked into a boom-and-bust culture. That’s drained the pockets of many a star-struck or misguided owner.’

Examples of clubs that aimed for the stars but have ended up in administration or other self-inflicted fiscal turmoil are numerous. Leeds, QPR, Birmingham and Coventry spring readily to mind.

But it is another example, Portsmouth, that most irks West Brom, who lost to a ‘financially doped’ Pompey in the 2008 FA Cup semi-finals. Portsmouth went on to win the trophy before a spectacular meltdown caused by the unsustainable spending undertaken to assemble and pay Harry Redknapp’s squad at that time.

Portsmouth were flying high and eventually won the FA Cup, but are now mid-table in the fourth division

West Brom say they are still frustrated at losing to a team Portsmouth 'basically couldn't afford'

‘It still pinches us at West Brom that we lost our last FA Cup semi-final to a team the opposition basically couldn’t afford,’ said Jenkins. ‘Our fans went home miserable that night. Theirs were jubilant. I suspect they would want to swap places now though.’

Pompey are now mid-table in the fourth tier. West Brom are looking increasingly likely to be safe in the top flight for a fifth year running. Some of their fans may feel they should be taking more risks with bigger-name players but Jenkins insists stability is key.

‘We have shown — along with one or two other clubs — that it is possible to compete in the PL by building, building, building — sensibly, year on year,’ he says. ‘You’re adding to the squad, the club’s infrastructure, sticking to your business plan, trying to get right as many decisions as you can while knowing that some things will go wrong because that is the nature of football.

‘The key thing is if and when that happens you are not so over-stretched that it becomes a catastrophe.’
