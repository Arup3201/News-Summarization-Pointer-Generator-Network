While an average person might be quick to swim away, Mr Ketchion swam directly towards the shark and jabbed it on its back with his spear gun.

Being aggressive towards the shark  is common practice among spear fishers as it can deter the animal from attacking because it fears the spear fisher as a predator.

And in Mr Ketchion's case it worked.

Footage shot by the spear fisher showed the great white slowly moving on from the area.

Mr Ketchion posted the video online and on social media, much to the amazement of his followers.
