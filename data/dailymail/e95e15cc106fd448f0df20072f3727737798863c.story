Germany forward Lukas Podolski has leapt to the defence of underfire Arsenal team-mate Mesut Ozil, saying he will light up the World Cup for Germany and prove his doubters wrong at the Emirates.

Record-signing Ozil came in for criticism towards the end of last season after losing his early season form and his halo appears to be slowly slipping for the Germany national team, too.

Coach Joachim Low has already backed the 25-year-old midfielder to produced the goods 'like he always has done' for Germany in Brazil, and Podolski has no doubts about Ozil's worth for club and country either.

Buddies: Podolski and Ozil spend a lot of time together for club and country and have been friends for years

'Mesut is a world-class player,' Podolski said on Sunday. 'Mesut has the quality and he's going to give us a lot of pleasure.

'He is going to produce the goods in the months and years to come and people have just got to accept him the way he is.

'Just let the lad play football.'

Ozil looks set to start for Germany in their World Cup opener against Portugal on Monday while Podolski could also be in line for a place in Low's XI after the injury-enforced withdrawal of Marco Reus.

'Everybody has got to be on their toes and ready,' Podolski said. 'I'm preparing myself as if I will be playing, and if I don't, then at least I would still be ready.'

Leader: Ozil is still a key man in the heart of Germany's midfield despite his indifferent Premier League form

The nation ranked second in the world faces the one ranked fourth with Low declaring it a '50/50' clash, but Podolski had a touch more optimism when he met the media on Saturday.

'Of course they have Cristiano Ronaldo, who is capable of deciding any game, but if we play the way we can, then we will leave the field triumphant,' he said.

'If we don't, then we've just got to hope that we manage to keep Ronaldo under control, or that he doesn't have a good day.

'My aim is to get my hands on the trophy in the end. I don't come to play for Germany just for the fun of it, and if anybody were to do that, then they would be better off just staying at home.'
