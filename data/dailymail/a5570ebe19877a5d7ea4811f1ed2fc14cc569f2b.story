Geoff says light was incredibly bright, and bits of the world were 'missing'

Earlier
 this year, the acclaimed British author Geoff Dyer fulfilled his 
ambition of moving to Los Angeles for the 'wonderful' weather and 
outdoors lifestyle.

He and his wife Rebecca quickly fell into a 
routine of coffee and almond croissants at a local cafe at 8am; she'd 
then go off to work (as chief curator of the online  gallery, Saatchi 
Art) and he'd go home  to write. Every other afternoon, he'd cycle to 
the tennis courts at Venice Beach as the sun set over the Pacific.

Two
 weeks after they'd moved to LA, Geoff was getting ready to head out 
with Rebecca when he remembered he had to put out the rubbish. Within 
seconds, he found himself in the middle of a medical emergency that 
might easily have cut this idyllic existence brutally short.

'I bent 
down to put the rubbish in the bin, but when I stood up again, half the 
world - everything to the left-hand side of me - had disappeared.

'Initially,
 I thought I'd lost the sight in my left eye, but I soon realised it was
 more complicated. I could see the frame of the mirror, but my face 
wasn't reflected in it, as though I was a vampire.

'Rebecca came out
 of the bedroom and I could see her up to chest level, but from there 
upwards she was missing; no shoulders, no head.'

Although this was 
'disorienting and disturbing', Geoff wasn't unduly worried. He was fit, 
slim and a non-smoker; he'd no reason to suspect anything serious.

Rebecca
 called the hospital's ophthalmology department and made an appointment 
for 9.30am. With an hour to wait, they decided to keep to their routine 
and go to the cafe first.

Geoff, however, found himself scrabbling 
around to gather his belongings. 'I was incredibly confused,' he 
recalls. 'I kept saying “Where are my keys?” and Rebecca would tell me 
that I was holding them.

'On the five-minute walk, I had to cling on 
to Rebecca. The light was incredibly bright, and bits of the world were 
still “missing”.' 

At the hospital, an eye test established that the
 problem was not his eyes but his brain. 'The doctor said the options 
were a migraine or a stroke - and as I'd never had migraines, I feared 
it had to be a stroke.'

A neurologist did tests, then sent him for 
an MRI scan. Within an hour, the neurologist delivered the bad news: 
Geoff had had an ischaemic stroke - caused by a blood clot in the back 
of the right half of his brain. 'My heart sank,' says Geoff. 'Two hours 
earlier, the world had been fine. Now I felt a series of trap doors was 
opening up beneath me. I thought: “Oh no, it's my brain. My whole 
writing life comes from there.”'

Geoff, 55, is the author of 14 
books, and in 2011, his collection of essays, Otherwise Known As The 
Human Condition, won America's National Book Critics Circle Award for 
Criticism.

In many ways, his stroke didn't make sense. He cycles six 
miles a day, plays tennis and table tennis, and his diet is healthy. 'I 
hate all the food you're meant to avoid, such as fried, fatty foods, but
 I do have a fondness for pastries.' He doesn't smoke and drinks only 
moderately. Nor was there any family history of strokes.

'Of all my contemporaries, I'd have thought I was least at risk from a stroke,' he says.

Strokes affect 150,000 a year in England, and are the third most common cause of death. 'The
 majority of sufferers are over 75, and it is linked to factors such as 
furred-up arteries and high blood pressure,' explains Dr Richard Perry, 
consultant neurologist at the National Hospital for Neurology and 
Neurosurgery in London.

'However, one-quarter of all sufferers are 
under 65. In younger patients, most strokes are caused by a clot which 
has formed in the heart or blood vessels and then travelled to the 
brain.'

After his initial diagnosis, Geoff stayed in hospital 
overnight for more tests. His eyesight was steadily improving, and by 
9pm he 'could just about see to type'. His wife brought in his laptop 
and he began reading up about strokes.

One of the things he learned 
was that strokes can often be preceded by mini strokes, or TIAs 
(transient ischaemic attacks), which can last anything from a few 
seconds to 24 hours. These are regarded as warnings that a major stroke 
is on the way.

Geoff now realised that he had suffered several of these episodes over the previous two years. 'Several times, but for less than a minute each time, my vision went all weirdly sparkly and was incredibly bright. 

'And
 once, in spring of last year, my thumb and index finger went totally 
numb for a few minutes. It was startling enough for me to comment on it 
to Rebecca. But then it passed - and I forgot all about it.'

In 
fact, anyone experiencing a sudden onset of neurological symptoms such 
as numbness or weakness in the limbs, drooping of facial muscles, speech
 problems or loss of vision, should be  checked out immediately at 
A&E, says Dr Perry.

He says national guidance now is that such 
patients should then be seen by a stroke specialist within a day if they
 are deemed to be at high risk of a further stroke, within seven days if
 they are low risk. This approach was introduced following a 2007 
study by the Radcliffe Infirmary at Oxford that 'sent shock waves' 
through the specialism, said Dr Perry. 

'By seeing TIA patients 
immediately and with aggressive management with statins (they asked 
patients to take the first dose in front of them!), the medical 
researchers were able to prevent 80 per cent of strokes that would have 
happened when the patient wouldn't have seen a specialist for several 
weeks. 

'It's also very cost-effective. You don't have to prevent 
many strokes before you start to reduce the massive expense of 
disability.'

By noon next day, Geoff was relieved to find more of his left side vision had returned. 

The
 signs of a mini stroke or TIA (trans ischaemic attack) are similar to 
those of full-blown stroke but they tend to last just a few minutes.

If you suspect you've experienced one, it's vital to be checked by a doctor as soon as possible. Signs to watch out for are:

'The
 neurologist said they didn't know whether the blockage had cleared or 
whether the brain, with its great ability to re-route stuff, had just 
got round the blockage, but it all seemed pretty good.'

He was 
discharged with low-dose aspirin to prevent another clot and a statin to
 be taken daily (20 mgs Lipitor) for cholesterol-lowering as a 
precaution.

'The next day, the neurologist rang to say my cholesterol results were through the roof, and the statin dose was doubled.'

The
 precise cause of his stroke was never established but Geoff was one of 
the lucky ones. While a third of stroke sufferers recover fully, 
one-third die and a third are left with a physical disability.

'It was incredibly lucky to have had such a mild one,' he says.

After three months, his statin dose was halved as his cholesterol levels were down to a respectable 4.25.

Today, he has 98 per cent of his vision back. But Geoff admits that it's only recently that he's stopped feeling vulnerable.

'I
 worried that a bigger stroke might be on the way.' His stroke, he says,
 has highlighted 'how very precarious this thing of good health is'.

Geoff's latest book, Another Great Day at Sea: Life Aboard The USS George H.W. Bush, is published by Visual Editions, £25.
