George Zimmerman's attorneys have released new photos showing evidence related to the night in February 2012 when the neighborhood watch volunteer shot and killed unarmed teen Trayvon Martin.

The new batch of photos include pictures of Martin’s belongings on the night he was killed including the cell phone he used to speak to his girlfriend for the last time, plus the Skittles and bottle of ice tea he had just bought at a local 7/11.

Defense attorneys have issued the photos as they prepare for Zimmerman’s upcoming second-degree murder trial, which is scheduled to begin June 10.

The photos, taken by Zimmerman's defense team on Aug. 8 at a state crime lab, show other important pieces of evidence including the hoodie with a bullet hole in it that Trayvon wore, reports the Orlando Sentinel.

Two photos that had not been released before Wednesday show Zimmerman in a cap and gown during a graduation ceremony at Seminole State College.

Zimmerman was pursuing a two-year criminal justice degree, but while he attended the ceremony, school records show he did not actually graduate, having failed one of his classes.

Other images, which have been seen before, include photos of Zimmerman with a broken and bloody nose and surveillance images showing Martin buying Skittles and a bottle of iced tea at a 7-Eleven just minutes before the deadly scuffle.

These are the photographs his defense team believe will best serve their client's self-defense case when his trial begins next month hope these are the images that 

Defense attorneys had to list all 
evidence turned over to prosecutors. It include items they opted not to 
make public because of Florida privacy laws, including half dozen 
autopsy photos of Martin plus 17 taken of him at the scene of the 
shooting.

The 29-year-olf former Neighborhood 
Watch volunteer killed Trayvon, an unarmed black 17-year-old, on Feb. 
26, 2012, after calling Sanford police and describing the teenager as 
suspicious.

Zimmerman's defense team also filed a motion on Tuesday asking the judge to deny a request by prosecutors to ban blood samples from Trayvon Martin's autopsy from being submitted as evidence during the trial.

According to Zimmerman's lawyers, the results of those blood tests showed traces of marijuana in Martin's system, and they argue jurors should know that.

The defense claimed Martin brought pot with him to Sanford and used it at least once before he was killed.

But prosecutors called that evidence irrelevant to the events surrounding the shooting, saying there was no evidence suggesting Martin used the pot at or even near the time of his death, and no witnesses have suggested that the level of marijuana in Martin's blood had any bearing on the cause of his death.

Two weeks ago Zimmerman told a circuit judge he would not be seeking an immunity hearing under the state's ‘Stand Your Ground’ self-defense law.

Under questioning from Circuit Judge Debra Nelson, George Zimmerman repeatedly said ‘yes’ to a series of questions asking if he was aware he was giving up the right to a hearing before his second-degree murder trial in June.

A judge would have sole discretion in an
immunity hearing to decide if Zimmerman is exempt from culpability in 
the shooting. A jury would make the determination in the murder trial.

‘After consultation with my counsel, yes, your honor,’ Zimmerman said.

The judge had set aside two weeks at the end of April for an immunity hearing should Zimmerman want one.

Prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda had filed a motion asking that Zimmerman make clear his intentions on whether he wanted the hearing.

Zimmerman's defense attorney, Mark O'Mara, told the judge there was nothing in the law that required the immunity hearing to take place before Zimmerman's trial and could be requested after prosecutors have presented their case.

‘We'd much rather have the jury address the issue of criminal liability or lack thereof,’ O'Mara said.

Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty, claiming self-defense. Trayvon Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old boy, was fatally shot February 26, 2012, during a fight with Zimmerman in a Sanford gated community.

O'Mara also wanted the court to unseal details on a civil settlement totaling more than $1million that Martin's parents received from Zimmerman's homeowner's association.

O'Mara contended the settlement could influence the testimony of Martin's parents, if they are called as witnesses.

The judge said defense attorneys and prosecutors could see full copies of the settlement but the public would only be able to see a version from which some information has been removed.

Nelson rejected a request by O'Mara to find fault with prosecutors for what the defense attorney described as violations in providing discovery evidence to them.

O'Mara said that prosecutors' failure to disclose evidence in a timely manner had caused his team ‘hours and hours of work.’

The judge said she would hold a hearing after the trial to determine if prosecutors should have to pay for some costs that O'Mara said he incurred because of the alleged discovery problems.
