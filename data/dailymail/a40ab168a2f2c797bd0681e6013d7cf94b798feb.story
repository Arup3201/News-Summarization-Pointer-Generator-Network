Stealing the show at the Interstellar film premiere this week wasn’t its star, Anne Hathaway, but rather her necklace . . . or should that be ‘backlace’?

For the 31-year-old accessorised her deep-blue satin Richard Nicoll gown with a delicate silver chain decorated with stars which hung down her back instead of her decolletage.

But she’s far from the first actress to challenge convention with this look: Cate Blanchett, Nicole Kidman and Kate Hudson have all worn the back necklace — or ‘back drop’ — on the red carpet in recent years. In fact, Princess Diana even tried it with pearls nearly 30 years ago.

Anne Hathaway stole the show at the Interstellar premiere with her backlace - a delicate silver chain decorated with stars

When done well, it can be deeply sexy. Subtler than a piece that nestles in the cleavage, a heavy chain hanging between the shoulder blades is a signal of independence: not for you the boring convention or obvious statement.

And, as the back ages so well and wrinkles less than other parts of the body, it’s a marvellous way for an older woman to draw attention away from a crepey bosom.

There’s something, too, about the slight weight of that drop at the back that seems to improve posture, straightening the shoulders, raising the head and pushing the pelvis forward, to show the jewellery off to best advantage.

Not every necklace or dress will work for this look. A lariat works best: a favourite of flappers showing off their daring backless frocks, it is a long, clasp-free chain or string of gems that can be knotted or looped at just the right spot, leaving the remaining length to hang dramatically down the spine.

Other necklaces are designed specifically for this look, with tiers and loops that are shaped for the width of a shoulder rather than a chest, and clasps where they won’t be seen.

But even a simple pendant can work beautifully: a heavy, jewelled tassel, for example, adds the necessary weight to hold the necklace in place, rather than having it slip forward or tangle up in your hair or a dress.

The crucial factor, though, is to give the necklace room to breathe: it should not clash with the straps of a dress, the back of a corset, or long, loose hair, but drape elegantly into the space created by a deep-cut back unimpeded by straps or corsetry.

Here we look at the stars who really have put their necks on the line.

NICOLE KIDMAN

 It’s a good job that this Balenciaga dress is as plain as can be, because for the 2008 Academy Awards, 47-year-old Nicole Kidman donned a massive 1,399 carats of rough diamonds designed into an immense collar by L’Wren Scott. While it looks like a back necklace, it can be worn either way. This one works, but its ostentatiousness lacks some of the panache of simple pendants and lariats.

CATE BLANCHETT

This look couldn’t be better. The 45-year-old’s silk Givenchy dress with its deep asymmetrical back is complemented by the V shape formed by Van Cleef & Arpel’s Zip necklace (it actually does zip up and down) with its diamond chain and pink sapphire tassel. The soft rose-gold warms up that expanse of skin, too, and the simple shape works on a character as strong as Cate.

KATE HUDSON 

Looking pitch-perfect at the Screen Actors’ Guild Awards in 2010, 35-year-old Kate Hudson gets everything right here, teaming a high-necked, long-sleeved Emilio Pucci gown with a Cartier diamond-tassel necklace, which swings down a plunging back. The diamonds pick up the sparkle of the white dress, and the simplicity of the silhouette leaves room for the necklace to really shine. No wonder she looks happy. 

NAOMI WATTS

There’s so much to love here — and the biggest thing is that incredible Serpenti ‘Ultimate Temptation’ necklace from Bulgari: 60 carats of diamonds, with a 12.16-carat diamond drop at the tip. Its construction means that the serpent’s tail drapes languidly down the back, neat but fluid at the same time. The 46-year-old actress’s side-swept hair gives the necklace plenty of space, revealing a long neck and toned shoulders. The dark sparkles on the pretty Marchesa dress, however, do clash somewhat with all that glittering ice.

CARA DELEVINGNE

The weight of the chimpanzee pendant by de Grisogono — featuring 771 black diamonds, yellow-sapphire bananas and a massive 28-carat sapphire — makes 22-year-old Cara’s necklace hang beautifully, and the short length means it perfectly frames her tattoo, rather than clashing with it. Having a real feature, such as this extraordinary animal, is a great idea, giving some purpose to the back-to-front necklace. What does clash, though, is the dark metal chain of the necklace and the silvery chain on her dress straps. 

JENNIFER LAWRENCE

Like Anne Hathaway, 24-year-old Jennifer Lawrence is a veteran of the back necklace, wearing a long one over a high-backed dress in 2013. Here, at the 2014 Oscars, she makes a better job of it by choosing a shorter necklace, with the Neil Lane diamonds daintily drawing attention to her rear-view. Exquisite. 

JESSICA BIEL

Biel, 32, breaks a cardinal rule of the backlace, with loose hair — but gets away with it. It’s partly down to the length of that Tiffany & Co necklace, partly because the whole look is so elaborate thanks to the Elie Saab dress, and because her posture makes the necklace swing loose from her back.
