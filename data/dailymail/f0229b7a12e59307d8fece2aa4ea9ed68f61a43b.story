Shy Dahan has been cleared of pretending to  be a millionaire to gamble huge sums of cash in a casino

A businessman walked free today after being cleared of pretending to be a millionaire in order to gamble thousands of pounds on credit in a London casino.

Shy Dahan was accused of using bogus Credit Suisse paperwork to mislead staff at the Playboy Club in Mayfair about his wealth in a bid to gain credit.

Mr Dahan, 33, produced documents from the Gibraltar arm of the Swiss bank showing he had £1million in his current account, jurors at Southwark Crown Court were told.

Today a jury cleared Mr Dahan of a single count of fraud by false representation after deliberating for four hours and 22 minutes.

On November 27, 2012, Mr Dahan visited the  casino on Park Lane and applied for credit to gamble.

He ended up owing the club £230,000 which he has now repaid.

Defence counsel Philip Hackett QC said the single charge regarded the letter from the defendant's bank to the Playboy Casino bank.

Regarding the letter Mr Hackett said: 'It was indeed signed from Credit Suisse, signed by an individual at Credit Suisse although he originally denied it.

'However, it was clear on the evidence that he did not have the authority to sign it and that a co-signatory had not signed it so he acted in excess of his authority to do it and the prosecution's case is that the defendant procured him to do that.'

He added the letter 'was not required and not relied on' by Mr Dahan.

Mr Dahan was previously cleared of similar charges relating to the Clermont Club in Berkeley Square in.

He was acquitted of three counts of fraud by false representation on 22 August this year during his first trial.

It was found he had no case to answer and the jury were discharged from considering the count relating to the Playboy Club.

Mr Dahan paid his debt to the Playboy Club following a hearing at Southwark Crown Court earlier this month when Mr Hackett successfully applied to the court to unfreeze his assets.

Mr Dahan, of Mayfair, and formerly of Tel-Aviv in Israel, denied the single count of fraud by false representation.
