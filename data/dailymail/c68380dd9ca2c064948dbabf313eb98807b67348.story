James Bond author Ian Fleming was invited to dinner by John F Kennedy on March 13, 1960, when he was preparing a run for the White House.

Kennedy asked the former British spy, who devised a number of plots during World War II, what the United States should do to deal with the worsening situation in Cuba. 

Fleming, it is claimed, told Kennedy, that killing Fidel Castro was not simply enough, he had to be thoroughly humiliated.

The CIA considered a range of methods of dealing with Fidel Castro, pictured, including poisoning his cigars 

According to Christopher Moran in the Journal of Cold War Studies: 'Fleming suggested flooding the streets of Havana with pamphlets explaining that radioactive fallout from nuclear testing caused impotence and was known to be drawn to men who had beards. 

'As a result, Cuban men would shave off their facial hair, thus severing a symbolic link to Castro and the revolution. If this did not work, the CIA should build a religious manifestation, ideally a cross of sorts, and fly it over the Havana skyline in order to induce the Cubans to look skyward.' 

Between 1960 and 1965 the CIA considered at least eight plots to assassinate Castro. 

On July 25, 1962, a Top Secret document was prepared for the White House outlining Operation Mongoose, which considered the overthrow of Castro. 

According to the document: 'As desired by higher authority [President Kennedy] on November 30, 1961, the US undertook a special effort "in order to help Cuba overthrow the Communist regime".' 

Fleming was a close friend of CIA director Allen Dulles, pictured, who quizzed the Bond author about spycraft

The CIA considered tampering with Fidel Castro's cigar, either poisoning it or turning it into an explosive

Dulles was fascinated by Charles Fraser-Smith, who was the inspiration for Q in the Bond books, and was a technical expert for the Special Operations Executive during the second world war designing gadgets 

Operation Mongoose involved the 'acquisition of hard intelligence of the target area.

'Undertaking all other political, economic and covert actions, short of inspiring a revolt in Cuba or developing the need for US armed intervention. 

'Be consistent with US overt policy, and remain in position to disengage with minimum of loss in assets and US prestige. 

'Continue JCS [Joint Chiefs of Staff] planning and essential preliminary actions for a decisive US capability for intervention.' 

Fleming was a close friend of the first civilian director of the CIA Allen Dulles, who was due to also attend the dinner with Kennedy. 

Dulles called Fleming several days after the March 1960 dinner to speak about his ideas. 

Dulles and Fleming first met in London in 1959 when the spy-turned-author told the CIA director that 'Q' in his books was based on Charles Fraser-Smith, who produced gadgets for the Special Operations Executive during the Second World War. 

Dulles later wrote that he had tasked the CIA to develop a homing beacon used to track a car in Fleming's Bond book Goldfinger, released in 1959.

He said: 'I put my people in CIA to work on this as a serious project, but they came up with an answer that it had too many bugs in it. The device really didn't work very well with the enemy got into a crowded city.' 

John F Kennedy wanted to meet with Ian Fleming because he was so impressed with his Bond creation

Robert Wallace, retired director of the CIA's technical service said: 'When a new Bond movie was released, we always got calls asking, "Do you have one of those?" If I answered "no", the next question was, "How long will it take you to make it?" Folks didn't care about the laws of physics or that Q was an action in a fictional series - his character and inventiveness pushed or imagination.' 

During the early to mid 1960s, the CIA considered at least eight plots to assassinate Castro as part of Operation Mongoose.

Brigadier-General Edward Lansdale oversaw plans which considered placing Tallium salt in his shoes which would cause Castro's beard to fall out. 

Another possible way of killing Castro involved his cigars, with one plan to hide an explosive in the tobacco or another to lace it with poison. 

Other agents studied the possibility of killing Castro while he was diving. Plans were discussed which considered infecting his air supply with a biological agent. 

But Desmond Fitzgerald, the CIA's former head of Cuban operations said he bought two books on Caribbean mollusks, to find a seashell suitable to hold an explosive device, which would kill the communist leader on the sea bed. 

Another plan, which seemed similar to one discussed at the Kennedy dinner table involved a CIA campaign describing Castro as the anti-Christ, while a US submarine would light up the sky with starbursts announcing the Second Coming. 

According to the Journal of Cold War Studies, the Russian newspaper Izvestiya remarked on the relationship between the CIA head and the James Bond author. In an editorial written in April 1962, the newspaper claimed: 'Fleming prides himself on his knowledge of espionage and villainy. His best friend is Allen Dulles... who even attempted (but unsuccessfully) to try methods recommended by Fleming in his books. Obviously American propagandists must be in a bad way if they have recourse to the help of an English retired spy turned mediocre writer.'
