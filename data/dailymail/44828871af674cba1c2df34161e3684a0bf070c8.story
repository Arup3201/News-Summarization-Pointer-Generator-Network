The former prime minister said it Ed Miliband must not win any votes by taking a tougher line on immigration and Europe. He said changing course now would only 'confuse' voters

Tony Blair was criticised last night for complaining about voters who elected Ukip MEPs opposed to rampant immigration – despite  running an ‘open door’ policy on migrants while in office.

The former prime minister said it was wrong that the debate on the EU was dominated by ‘anti-immigrant feeling and a desire to get Britain out of Europe’. These, he added, were ‘not answers to what is happening in the world’.

But critics pointed out that it was Mr Blair’s policies which caused the problems in the first place by allowing immigration to run rife over the last decade, creating the largest population explosion since Saxon times.

In his comments, made to a Swedish television station, Mr Blair said: ‘Of course we should be worried when a party like Ukip comes first in the European election, it would be foolish not to be.

‘But on the other hand we also have to stand for what is correct and right for the future of Britain in the 21st century.

‘When the world is changing so fast, to end up having the debate dominated by anti-immigrant feeling and a desire to get Britain out of Europe, these are not solutions for the 21st century.’

But Douglas Carswell, the Tory MP for Clacton, said Mr Blair was a member of a ‘supranational, smug, anti-democratic elite’.

He added: ‘Tony Blair was in charge of this country when the floodgates were opened.

‘He did nothing to control immigration. It is obnoxious and morally wrong for him to suggest that there is something illegitimate about people voting Ukip.’

Labour’s open-door migration policy led to the largest population explosion in Britain in more than a thousand years.

Between 1997 and 2010, the foreign-born population of the UK increased by three million, while nearly a million British citizens left.

In that period, the size of the foreign-born workforce nearly doubled.

In 1997, people born outside the UK held two million jobs – making up around 7.5 per cent of the total workforce. By 2009, that had swelled to 3.8million jobs, or 13 per cent of the total.

Labour ministers predicted in 2004 that opening Britain’s labour market to millions of workers from former Eastern Bloc countries would result in only 13,000 new arrivals. By the end of 2009, more than a million workers had signed up to a Home Office registration scheme.

In 2009 former Blairite aide Andrew Neather revealed that the increase in immigration under Labour was a deliberate policy designed to change Britain.

He said the influx of foreign nationals was intended to socially engineer a ‘truly multicultural’ country.

It was also a politically motivated attempt to ‘rub the Right’s nose in diversity’, he said.

Mr Neather, a former speechwriter to Mr Blair, wrote that ‘the policy of ministers from late 2000 ... was to open up the UK to  mass migration.’
