It's debatable whether selling the dearest pie in football is something to be proud of - but Conference club Kidderminster Harriers can boast they do just that.

The non-League side charge £4.50 for those at the Aggborough to try one of their famous delicacies, and the occasional chant of 'Who ate all the pies?' is rarely far behind. 

In 2012, former Kidderminster manager Steve Burr jokingly said: 'My players eat them before the game, at half time and after the match. Barcelona have (Lionel) Messi, Real Madrid have (Cristiano) Ronaldo and Kidderminster have our pies.'
