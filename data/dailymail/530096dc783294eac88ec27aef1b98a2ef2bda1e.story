Healthy: But six-year-old Tayler Gunn has been left terrified of putting on weight after his school sent him a letter saying he was close to being clinically obese

A six-year-old boy has been left terrified of putting on weight because his school nurse told him he was too fat.

Tayler Gunn refuses to eat cheese, ham and spaghetti after being sent a letter from his school, Millhouse Infants in Laindon, Essex saying he was close to being clinically obese.

When he was sent the letter, Tayler weighed three stone 5lbs and was 3ft 6ins tall. Since then he has grown two inches but has actually lost one pound in weight.

His mother Leanne Kane, 25, of 
Devonshire Gardens, Laindon, Essex, says: 'It is something he worries 
about. It's ridiculous, I just keep telling him he's strong, he's not 
fat, he's strong.

'It definitely affected him, and he is 
really worried about his weight.

'I was so angry because I was given a 
letter basically saying that I'm not looking after him properly, but I 
do. He thinks he is too fat and he's six. It's just awful.'

To try to help youngsters worried about their weight, MPs have made recommendations that all school children receive compulsory body image and self-esteem classes.

It follows a report by the All Party Parliamentary Group on body image, which said more than half of the public has a negative body image and girls as young as five now worry about how they look.

The parliamentary group report also said cosmetic surgery rates have increased by nearly 20 per cent since 2008 and blames media images of super skinny celebrities.

As part of the same recommendation there was a call for a review into the Equality Act, suggesting it be amended to include appearance-related discrimination.

Another recommendation was a review into whether the Equality Act 2010 should be amended to include appearance-related discrimination, which would be classed the same as race and sexual discrimination.

Leanne, welcomed anything that could be done to help children, but says government involvement was one of the reasons Tayler was so self conscious about his weight.

Lisa-Marie Jobson, principal of the San-Marie Stage School, both in Billericay, Essex believes classes to help children with self-esteem and body image issues would be a positive step.

She said: 'I see things from two sides - I think in some ways it is important that children are aware of their bodies for health and medical reasons. Children should be aware of the importance of exercise and not getting over-weight.

'But I also think the Government could do more in teaching children that everyone is different. We all have different body shapes and we are all good at many different things. These realities should be appreciated.

'I would say that the ad agencies for TV
commercials have made big changes since I first came into the industry.
The casting briefs we get these days are often looking for 'real 
children' - they want children of all shapes and sizes, from all races. 
It didn't used to be like that.

Anger: Tayler's mother Leanne Gunn with the letter sent by the school nurse. When it arrived, Tayler weighed three stone 5lbs and was 3ft 6ins tall. Since then he has grown two inches but has actually lost one pound in weight

'As for the mags and brochures, they are specifically looking for perfect children. I don't think this is such a good thing as it puts a hell of a strain on young children.

'I find a lot of children are very self aware of their bodies and the children who come to us for dance classes are particularly aware. Many come for fun and exercise which is great - they are aware of body health. '

Clinical psychologist Zach de Beer said: 'Body image is a major issue and can lead onto other problems; commercial and cultural pressures are real.

'Any kind of bullying or verbal abuse, for whatever reason, is not acceptable and can have a catastrophic effect on some vulnerable young people.'
