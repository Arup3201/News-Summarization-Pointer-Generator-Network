Buying a holiday home, a trip to the Maldives and swimming with dolphins are all top of the average British person’s bucket list.

Driving Route 66 in America, a romantic trip to Venice and marvelling at the Egyptian Pyramids also featured in the top 40 things people would most like to do before they die.

Floating in the Dead Sea, riding in a hot air balloon, and taking in the view from the top of the Empire State Building also made it on to the checklist of must-do experiences.

The desire to learn a new language also scored highly, with almost a third of those surveyed eager to improve their linguistic skills. 

The survey reveals that alongside more materialistic wishes a significant 60 per cent simply want to stay as healthy as possible. 

The study of 2,000 people, commissioned by Engage Mutual, found the average person holds 16 key dreams they want to achieve in life.

However, 60 per cent concede that realistically they will never get close to achieving the majority of their aims with many not having ticked anything off their bucket list for at least six months. 

The study also found swimming with dolphins is a dream for more than a quarter of us, taking in the sights of Paris from the Eiffel Tower is also among the top 40 bucket list dreams. 

Self- improvement was another common theme among the bucket list items, with the desire to learn an instrument an ambition in common for 17 per cent, while volunteering for a good cause is important for 14 per cent.

Spokesman Engage Mutual said: ‘The results reveal a colourful array of aims and ambitions that many of us hope to fulfil during our lives.

‘Many seek to ensure things are in place for a comfortable retirement during which they can help children and grandchildren achieve their own aims. 

‘But many feel they won't be able to fulfil all of these dreams, blaming their financial positions for holding them back.’When reflecting on their lives so far people were most likely to say the financial side of life was the area that hadn't gone as well as planned with 40 per cent wishing they were better with money. 

Retirement is a key focus with half of respondents aiming to ensure theirs is as comfortable as possible, something which becomes even more of a priority the closer it gets.

A third of respondents cite the ability to leave their children with a property or good inheritance as their biggest goal with their remaining time.

Yet 48 per cent of those still working worry they have not set themselves up financially or saved enough. 

Work-life balance also proves elusive - more than a third feel they have got the balance wrong.

Mutual added: ‘Finding the balance between financial security to ensure your later years are comfortable, while making sure life is lived and experienced fully today is a challenge. 

‘But planning for the good times and the not so good times will always be a better option than burying our heads in the sand.’
