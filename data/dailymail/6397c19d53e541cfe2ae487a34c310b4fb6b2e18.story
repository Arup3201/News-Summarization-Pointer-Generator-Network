Monbeg Dude has been given the all-clear to run in the Crabbie’s Grand National at Aintree on April 11 after disappointing trainer Michael Scudamore at the Cheltenham Festival.

Scudamore has also revealed a shot at the Grade One Celebration Chase at Sandown on April 25 is one of the options for Grand Annual Chase winner Next Sensation.

Monbeg Dude, the gelding part owned by former England rugby union captain Mike Tindall and fellow international James Simpson-Daniel, was a never-dangerous 14th in the Ultima Business Solutions Handicap Chase under Paul Carberry.

Scudamore has run a series of tests on the 10-year-old, who was seventh in last year’s National. With the results coming up negative, Scudamore believes the most likely reason for Monbeg Dude’s below par effort was his resentment of a tongue tie being fitted for the first time.

The trainer said: ‘We were disappointed with his Cheltenham run but he has come back fine. There is no reason not to run at Aintree and the tongue tie will be left off.

‘We think maybe he did not enjoy running in it even though he has plenty of experience of it being fitted at home.’

Scudamore is not thinking of Aintree for Next Sensation and the gelding has options at both Ayr and Punchestown but the trainer is tempted by the Celebration Chase.

Scudamore added: ‘We are looking at Ayr and Punchestown, although my only worry about Ireland, given he is a nervy character, is the travelling. The Celebration Chase is in the back of my mind. They are talking of taking (2014 winner) Sire De Grugy there but there are usually only five or six runners.’

Scudamore will discuss Monbeg Dude jockey plans in the next week and also looking for a rider is Neil Mulholland, whose The Druids Nephew, a 12-1 Grand National shot, won the Cheltenham race they both contested.

Mulholland has lost both first choice Barry Geraghty, who broke shinbone in a fall on Sunday, and second choice Davy Russell, who broke his arm 24 hours earlier.

Geraghty is hoping to be back in action for the Punchestown Festival which starts on April 28.

Mange All, trained by William Haggas, has been trimmed to 11-2 favourite for Saturday’s Lincoln Handicap at Doncaster by William Hill.
