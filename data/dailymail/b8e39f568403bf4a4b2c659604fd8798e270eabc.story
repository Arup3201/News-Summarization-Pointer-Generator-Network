A massive political row has erupted in Ireland after the country singer Garth Brooks pulled out of a massive comeback special in Dublin this month.

The top-selling U.S. singer cancelled a sold-out run at Dublin's Croke Park stadium after city chiefs granted permission for just three out of the five planned gigs.

Taoiseach Enda Kenny described Brooks decision to pull out as a 'shock to the system' that will damage Ireland's slow economic recovery.

Comeback: Garth Brooks, who quit touring 13 years ago, has pulled out of a massive comeback gig in Croke Park stadium in Dublin after the council refused to give for permission for two of the five planned dates

The gigs were expected to draw 400,000
 fans to the Irish capital and pump millions into the local economy,
 which was plunged into a deep recession by the 2008 financial crisis.

Brooks, who turned his back on touring to raise his family in Oklahoma 13 years ago, had issued an all-or-nothing ultimatum last week, saying he would play the five nights or none at all.

The star said to choose one show over another 'would be like asking to choose one child over another'.

Mr Kenny said a feud over the gigs, which pitted Government ministers, tourism chiefs, business leaders and city representatives against each other, was 'very badly handled all round'.

'But there is a planning process in place, which is the law, and that planning process allowed for three concerts,' he added.

He said the pull-out would cost Dublin's economy in the region of a quarter of a billion euros.

'It's a shock to the system in terms of the economy of this city and the reputation of our country and I do hope that these kind of issues can be more efficiently handled on the next occasion that they arise,' he said.

The political fall-out comes as the Irish Daily Mail revealed that Brooks would not have made a cent playing just three Croke Park gigs.

The country music legend decided to pump the profits from the first three concerts into a spectacular production to ensure his Irish fans would experience a once-in-a-lifetime sensation.

And when he was told last week - just three weeks before the date of the first concert - that Dublin City Manager Owen Keegan had scrapped two of the dates, it was too late to alter the show's dynamics which had been tailored to suit Croke Park.

Last night, while Ticketmaster was preparing for the nightmare scenario of refunding the ticket price to 400,000 fans, Fianna FÃ¡il was still hopeful that the Government would adopt its Bill in a bid to save all five gigs.

And as the bodies involved in the fiasco exchanged accusations, a wellplaced source explained that playing three dates was simply not 'financially viable', for the musician.

'When Garth was told that there was going to be five dates, he decided to pump money into the production for the live shows,' said the source.

'Every cent that he would have made from the first three nights was ploughed straight into the staging, the lighting and the rigging. He had ordered graphics and custom-built screens. It was going to be a show of a lifetime and all 400,000 fans were going to see something special.

'This would have really put Ireland 
and Garth Brooks on the map but sadly now that won't happen. He is not a
 charity and for these gigs to have made money, he would have had to 
play the five dates'

'This has nothing to do with greed for Garth. This has to do with a decision he made to put on a series of concerts that would have been unrivalled in the history of country music.

'This would have really put Ireland and Garth Brooks on the map but sadly now that won't happen. He is not a charity and for these gigs to have made money, he would have had to play the five dates.'

Dublin City Council blocked two of the concerts last week because of an agreement between the stadium owners, the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), and local residents about how many major music events can take place a year.

The resulting row - which has dominated the national airwaves - prompted frantic efforts by Lord Mayor Christy Burke to relocate the two gigs, while State arbitrators attempted to negotiate compromises between all sides.

During the fiasco a split emerged among residents.

A solicitor for some lodged papers in the High Court demanding the remaining shows be cancelled while at the same time another group from the neighbourhood handed a petition to the city manager appealing for all five shows to go ahead.

A crisis meeting of the city council on Tuesday heard claims Brooks was preparing to divert a ship containing equipment for the stage, which former junior minister Ciaran Cuffe said was akin to 'putting a gun' to the Lord Mayor's head.

According to another well-placed source, Garth Brooks was going to use Croke Park as a benchmark for a world tour: no dates have been planned for this, although Brooks planned to hold an online press conference tomorrow.

There had been widespread speculation it would be a platform for the announcement.

But the sources said: 'He will not be announcing a tour on Thursday. I can tell you that Garth is devastated by this decision. The show he was about to unveil in Dublin would have made music history and now it will never see the light of day.

'This is not a show that can simply be moved to another location. There are no more dates and the rig won't fit another stadium. I won't say that Garth Brooks will never come back to Dublin, he loves Ireland and loves the hundreds of thousands of his fans that bought tickets and fought for the gigs to go ahead. But it will take a long time for the wounds to heal.'

Show promoter Peter Aiken has already described the scale of the production that was being created by Brooks's design team in America.

He said they were scheduled to start work on the massive production in Croke Park next Saturday, for the first gig on July 25. They were putting 22 truckloads of equipment into the Cusack Stand, 'with lighting and sound effects to create this one-off show'.

He added: 'All the customised pieces of video equipment that he's bringing in, we can't strip that down and then move to another venue.'

Meanwhile, chief executive of the Labour Relations Commission Kieran Mulvey, who was brought in to hammer out a deal between those residents who opposed the concerts and Croke Park, has revealed that he had been extremely close to finding a solution when Dublin City Council announced it was only allowing three concerts.

He said: 'I thought I had got close enough to it, in terms of addressing 99 per cent of the concerns of everybody, including the residents. There was a small group of people I felt no matter what you did, weren't going to be satisfied.

'But then the Dublin City Manager made his decision and, despite all the efforts afterwards, the prospect of getting Garth Brooks to the country wasn't going to materialise.'

He added: 'I don't know if we will ever see Garth Brooks performing in the country again. The artist himself, from what I understand, is personally very upset. Fans will be upset. Some people may take joy in the fact that he's not coming but I don't think the country does. I think it's a problem for the country in terms of how we are seen in the tourist market and the concert market, nobody wins.'

The GAA has said it was not given any indication that a licence was likely to be refused for any of the five concerts. Representatives said, in a statement, they had engaged fully with council officials and addressed every issue presented during the planning process. 'At no stage were we given any indication that a licence was likely to be refused for any of the five concerts,' it said.

The GAA made clear that it accepted Mr Mulvey's report. It added: 'The GAA is very encouraged by the emergence in recent days of groups of residents in the Croke Park area who share our wish for a positive continuing engagement with the Croke Park stadium; we look forward to working with them.'

Dublin City Council said it was 'very disappointed' at the decision by Aiken Promotions not to proceed with the three Garth Brooks concerts that had been licensed for Croke Park. 'The City Council has sympathy for ticket holders who purchased tickets for the performances. Dublin City Council hopes that Aiken Promotions will reconsider its decision. Once again, we would like to reiterate that Dublin City Council granted a licence for three concerts.'

But Louis Walsh told the Mail last night that nobody would be more upset than Peter Aiken that the shows have been scrapped.

And he called on Taoiseach Enda Kenny to rescue the situation. 'I know Peter Aiken and he's one of the best promoters in the business, and respected worldwide,' he said. 'He's best friends with Garth Brooks, and his manager. I've never seen him so excited as when he booked these gigs. This was very personal to him and his family.' Ticketmaster said that it is working on a plan to make the ticket return process as simple as possible, and it will be outlined today.

Last night Mr Aiken defended the singer for 'sticking by his principles'.

'It's the right decision. We are devastated, it was going to be the biggest musical event, there will never be another artist in my lifetime that's going to do 400,000 tickets and I don't know where the position is with Garth Brooks coming back to Ireland. There will be flak, you'll take flak, I'll take the flak but it's the right decision. He is devastated, he's down for millions in this deal, if it was any other artist maybe they'd say let's play the three and recoup some money.'
