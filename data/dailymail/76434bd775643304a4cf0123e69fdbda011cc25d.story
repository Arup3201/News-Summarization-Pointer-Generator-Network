Two Chinese monkeys, named Ningning and Mingming, have become the first genetically-modified primates to be born using a powerful ‘cut and paste’ DNA technique.

Scientists claim the technology could usher in a new era in genetic medicine and help combat diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

Dubbed CRISPR-Cas9, the technology precisely changes target parts of genetic code and could create more realistic research models of human disease.

Two Chinese monkeys, named Ningning and Mingming, have become the first genetically-modified primates to be born using a powerful 'cut and paste' DNA technique

In this case, it was used to manipulate two genes in fertilised monkey eggs before they were transferred to surrogate mothers.

Writing in the journal, Cell, the team from Nanjing Medical University reported the successful delivery of twin female long-tailed macaques using the technique.

Five surrogate mothers miscarried and four more pregnancies are ongoing.

Scientists have previously used the new genome-editing technology to delete, insert, and modify DNA in human cells grown in petri dishes.

The ladder-rung patterns in an image of a DNA gel show that genome editing successfully modified a gene in two macaque infants (shown in the central columns), but not in an untreated animal (right column)

CRISPR-Cas9 technology precisely changes target parts of genetic code

Unlike other gene-silencing tools, the CRISPR-Cas9 system targets the genome’s source material and permanently turns off genes at the DNA level.

The DNA cut – known as a double strand break – closely mimics the kinds of mutations that occur naturally, for instance after chronic sun exposure.

But unlike UV rays that can result in genetic alterations, the CRISPR-Cas9 system causes a mutation at a precise location in the genome.

When cellular machinery repairs the DNA break, it removes a small snip of DNA. In this way, researchers can precisely turn off specific genes in the genome.

But the new study shows for the first time that CRISPR-Cas9 can create healthy primates with their DNA modified at specific targeted genes.

Jiahao Sha, who led the Chinese team, said that CRISPR-Cas9 could be used to create monkeys that carry genetic faults that lead to diseases in humans for animal testing.

The technology can also be used to grow human organs in the lab, and used to test drugs, or to monitor how serious diseases can affect the body.

Precise changes in DNA are also being investigated as a way to make people resistant to HIV.

Scientists believe CRISPR-Cas9 has the potential to overcome many of the limitations of currently available gene-silencing techniques.

‘We can now use this technology on a genome-wide scale, giving us the ability to interrogate any gene we want,’ said Feng Zhang, a member of the Broad Institute and assistant professor at MIT.

The CRISPR-Cas9 procedure has been welcomed by geneticists in labs around the world because of its huge potential.

But this recent breakthrough has created opposition by some groups opposed to animal testing.

'Our study shows that the CRISPR/Cas9 system enables simultaneous disruption of two target genes in one step without producing off-target mutations, said study author Jiahao Sha of Nanjing Medical University.

'Considering that many human diseases are caused by genetic abnormalities, targeted genetic modification in monkeys is invaluable for the generation of human disease models.'
