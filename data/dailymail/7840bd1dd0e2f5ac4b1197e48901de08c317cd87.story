It's one of the most distinctive and recognisable accents in the UK and now research has found that scouse is also considered to sound the least intelligent, least friendly and least trustworthy in the whole country.

An investigation for ITV's Tonight programme found there is a social stigma and snobbery towards particular regional accents, with the scouse accent faring the worst across all categories and one in five Brits admitting to being discriminated against because of how they talk.

The Devon accent scored high in all three categories, and came top for friendliness, while Londoners and Scots believed they were most discriminated against.

The Devon accent, spoken by people including Dawn French, pictured left, was considered very friendly by 21 per cent of people. Scousers, such as Steven Gerrard, right, were rated as sounding the least friendly

In terms of friendliness, the Devon accent was perceived to be the country's friendliest, with nearly two thirds (65 per cent) of Britons rating it highly, including one fifth (21 per cent), finding it very friendly. Women were more likely than men to find almost all the accents more friendly, in particular London Cockney

The poll by ComRes asked a total of 4,000 Britons to rate accents in terms of friendliness, intelligence and trustworthiness. It then asked them to reveal whether they feel they have even been discriminated against in work or social situations.

The accents included Liverpool, Devon, Newcastle, Edinburgh, Cardiff, London (Cockney), Belfast, Received Pronunciation, Manchester and Birmingham.

A quarter of Brits (26 per cent) voted the scouse accent as the least friendly, while people from Devon were considered the most friendly in 65 per cent of cases.

People from Manchester, and those who speak the Queen's English scored the same on the friendliness scale.

Brummies were not considered particularly friendly or unfriendly, according to the results.

Received Pronunciation and the Devon accent were jointly perceived to be the most trustworthy accent at 51 per cent.

The Liverpudlian accent was the least trusted, with more people saying they do not trust it (29 per cent) than do (24 per cent).

Three in five people believe Received Pronunciation, spoken by actor Benedict Cumberbatch left, to be the most intelligent accent - almost twice the score of second place Edinburgh. Again, the Liverpudlian accent, spoken by Coleen Rooney, right, fared badly rated the 'most unintelligent' by 37 per cent of people

Liverpudlians sound the least intelligent, according to the research, with an average of 13 per cent of participants voting them 'not all intelligent'. The accent achieved an unintelligence score of 37 per cent overall - the highest of any dialect. Birmingham and London were close with 33 and 32 per cent respectively

accent was perceived to be the country’s friendliest, with nearly two

 fifth (21 per cent), who find it very friendly.

Interestingly, women are more 
likely than men to find almost all the accents more friendly, in 
particular London Cockney.

The Birmingham accent, spoken by actor Mark Williams, was considered unintelligent but received a neutral rating when it came to friendliness

The only exceptions were the Birmingham accent, in which men marginally preferred it over women (37 per cent to 36 per cent). More men also found the Devon accent more friendly than women, by two points at 66 per cent.

On the subject of intelligence, three in five people said that Received Pronunciation, also referred to a Queen’s English, is the most intelligent accent - almost twice the score of second place Edinburgh.

It tied with the Birmingham accent on intelligence, with only 15 per cent of people rating it intellectual.

People living in London were most likely 
to feel discriminated against due to their accent in a work environment, with a quarter of Londoners admitting to being discriminated against in the office.

Scots are most likely to
 feel they have been discriminated against during a social situation 
(29 per cent) or whilst being served in shops and restaurants (24 per cent).

Scots like Ewan McGregor, pictured left, were most likely to feel they have been discriminated against during a social situation (29 per cent) or whilst being served in shops and restaurants (24 per cent).
