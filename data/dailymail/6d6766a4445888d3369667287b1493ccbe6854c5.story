Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo believes they can put neighbours City in their place in the next derby, and insists Champions League qualification is a must.

Rojo joined from Sporting Lisbon during the summer for £16million, and it was against Manchester City on November 2 that he dislocated his shoulder  during a 1-0 defeat.

Louis van Gaal considers Rojo to be one of his certain starters when fit, putting the 24-year-old in the same group as David de Gea, Wayne Rooney, Daley Blind and Angel di Maria.

And the Argentina international hopes he can avoid injury until April 11, when United next face their rivals in the reverse fixture at Old Trafford. 

'It's vital we win the next Manchester derby at home in front of our own supporters - I think we are going to win that one,' Rojo tells Inside United.

'As for expectations from now to the end of the season, well, to try and give my absolute best in every game until the end, and hope that we pick up some good results along the way so we can be in with a shout in the shake-up for the title.'

Asked about his next five years, Rojo adds: 'My minimum objective this year is to qualify for next year's Champions League. It would be great to pick up a European trophy with this club. That and a league title is what I really want to win.'
