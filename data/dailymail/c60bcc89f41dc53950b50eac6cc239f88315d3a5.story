A 12-year-old girl was killed by her younger sibling in an accidental shooting just hours after she spoke about her love and thankfulness for her family at a church service.

The schoolgirl, identified by friends as Adelaide Clinger, had given a Thanksgiving-themed speech about her gratitude and love for family to fellow members of her Mormon church.

That afternoon emergency services were called to the Clinger's family home in Kaysville, Utah, where they immediately attempted life-saving measures on the girl but said she 'eventually succumbed to her injuries'.

Adelaide's neighbor Morgan Mojica said the last thing the girl said in church is that she loves her family

'She spoke in church today,' Adelaide's friend and neighbor Morgan Mojica told KUTV. 'The last thing she said is that she loves her family.'

'She was my best friend and I loved her so much,' the victim's 13-year-old friend Sydney Arveseth added. 'I don't know how I'm going to get through this.'

Jill Bowden, a neighbor who attended the same church as the Clinger family, told the Deseret News: 'She was saying how grateful she was for her family and how her friends and her mom and dad are the best things in her life.'

Officials said the victim attended Centennial Junior High School, which will have grief counselors on hand  for students who may be affected by the death.

Police have released few details about the shooting and noting the investigation is in its early stages, but they said they are not looking for any suspects.

Lieutenant Paul Thompson noted that handling incidents of this nature is difficult for officers, particularly those who have children of their own.

'It's certainly not easy for anybody involved in these sorts of calls,' he said.

Lt. Thompson added that such events offer a tragic reminder that firearms need to be securely stored in homes. 

He said 'at minimum a trigger lock, but at a maximum a safe is certainly best'. 

A tweet from the Davis County Health Department Sunday night said: 'We urge all families to lock up firearms and discuss gun safety with children.'
