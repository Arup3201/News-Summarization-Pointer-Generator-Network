A Lego fan has built the world's longest toy train track out of 93,000 bricks.

It takes more than three hours for a toy train to complete a lap of the 2.5mile circuit, which took a group of 80 builders more than six hours to piece together.

Henrik Ludvigsen, from Roskilde, Denmark, spent £50,000 and 18 months planning and designing the track, which has earned him a Guinness World Record.

A lover of Lego has poured his time and money into building the world's biggest toy train track out of 93,000 bricks

Henrik Ludvigsen, 43, spent £50,000 and 3,000 hours planning his Guinness World Record-certified circuit

A team of 80 builders spent six hours piecing together the 93,072 sleepers that formed the track to earn the title of the world's longest toy train circuit

Mr Ludvigsen, whose personal collection of Lego is worth £125,000, said: 'I was cleaning up a room in my home that was going to be used by an exchange student.

'While I was cleaning, I stumbled across my old Lego track and suddenly I got this crazy idea to build the world's longest toy train track.'

The 43-year-old, a chief technology officer for a Copenhagen company, used 93,072 Lego train track sleepers and worked out a clear strategy for how to assemble the pieces.

He added: 'I have played with Lego since I was five years old and this is certainly the biggest item I have made using the bricks. 

Mr Ludvigsen, whose personal Lego collection is worth more than £125,000, said the train track was a childhood dream

Mr Ludvigsen got the idea for building the track when he came across his old Lego train set while cleaning his spare room

Mr Ludvigsen said he was 'extremely proud' of his Guinness World Record which came out of a long-held dream

'It took us a while to make everything perfect so that the toy train could complete a lap of the circuit.

'But we eventually succeeded and it took the train 3 hours and 22 minutes to go around the track once.

'I'm extremely proud of what I've achieved, it was a dream come true, a dream founded more than 35 years ago.'

After 18 months of careful planning, the track finally carried its first trains at a hall in Denmark
