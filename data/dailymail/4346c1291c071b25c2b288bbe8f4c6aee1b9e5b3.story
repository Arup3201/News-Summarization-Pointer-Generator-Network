A council is spending more than £100,000 of public money on texting congratulations to people who recycle properly.

The money will be spent on sending 'positive messages' and 'interesting recycling facts' to Bolton residents who manage to put out their bins on the correct day.

But the scheme has been branded as 'patronising' amid suggestions that targeting those who already do the right thing is a waste of money.

Rubbish collection: Bolton Council will reward those who put their bins out on time with a congratulatory text or email

Elaine Sherrington, Bolton Council's environment boss, said: 'This has the potential to make a real difference'

The news comes the day after the Government announced that it would set aside £250million to fund weekly bin collections.

Bolton Council won a pay-out of £110,000 from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to pay for the scheme.

Those who sign up to it and 
regularly put out their recycling on the right day will receive 
congratulatory texts or emails from the council to reward their behaviour.

The council insists that making local people 'more involved in the recycling process' will boost recycling levels and make refuse collection work more efficiently.

Money from the scheme comes from a special Defra fund of £500,000.

More than 70 local authorities applied for funding, but Bolton Council was awarded more than a fifth of the money available.

The council says its texts and emails to recyclers will contain 'a positive message related to their participation; a positive message related to levels of participation within their area; a reminder sent the day before recycling collection due; information regarding what can and can’t be recycled; or interesting recycling facts.'

But Robert Oxley, campaign manager of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'It's great to see councils working to make recycling simpler, but it needn't cost a small fortune.

'Ensuring information about collection dates is easily available is a positive way to encourage recycling, but it's a little patronising to send congratulatory messages.'

However, Bolton Council insists that the scheme will be effective.

Councillor Elaine Sherrington, its environment boss, said: 'This has the potential to make a real difference to the borough's recycling rates, and will encourage a lot of people who aren't currently recycling to do so.

Rewarding: The council will contact people by phone or email to say well done

The evidence from previous studies shows that this sort of scheme can go a long way to changing behaviour both individually and in a community.

'Also, because the texts will make people who receive them more involved in the recycling process, I hope it will encourage them to act as champions in their area.'

A spokesman claimed that this method of encouraging recycling was 'at least as effective as door-stepping' and 'much more cost-effective'.

Without a concerted effort to reduce residual waste and drive up recycling rates, disposal costs could increase by £7million to £23million in four years, the council said.

A Defra spokesman said: 'Rewarding and recognising people for doing the right thing can encourage a range of positive behaviours, including recycling.

'More than half of us would recycle more if we were given a reward, or were recognised and thanked by the council for our effort.'
