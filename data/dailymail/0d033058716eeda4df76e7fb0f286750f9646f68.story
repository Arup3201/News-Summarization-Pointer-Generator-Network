A McDonald's security guard has been suspended after he told two kissing men they were making people feel uncomfortable.

The Leicester branch's bouncer prompted outrage after witnesses claimed he was asked if a straight couple would be more 'acceptable' - and replied: 'Yes'.

Matthew Dummigan, 23, said he was giving a male friend a simple 'peck' on the lips when the bouncer told him to stop.

Branch:  McDonald's in Leicester city centre has apologised and its doorman has been suspended after Matthew Dummigan, 23, was told giving a male friend a simple 'peck' on the lips made people feel 'uneasy'

One of the four friends who was with Mr Dummigan began arguing with the doorman's views and was thrown out, he said.

'It was horrific,' said Mr Dummigan, a dancer and choreographer. 'He said it was making people feel uneasy. It was really upsetting for me. 

'I tried to confront him about it - I told him his attitude wasn't right. I was really angry and upset.

'Gay people can get married and divorced, yet they get told off for showing a bit of affection - his attitude was so outdated.'

Mr Dummigan, who felt 'insulted', 'belittled' and 'patronised', said he held himself together until he got outside, then he 'broke down'. 

'One of my friends stuck up for us and he got chucked out,' he added.

'I've been out as gay for seven years and I have never witnessed anything like this in my life. I read about things like this happening in the papers but I never thought it would happen to me.

'It wasn't even a proper kiss, it was a peck.'

Comparison: The story comes after two BBC DJs who held hands for an experiment, Iain Lee and Justin Dealey (pictured), received homophobic abuse in the street in Luton, Bedfordshire

A spokesman for McDonald's said: 'We are very sorry for Mr Dummigan's experience when visiting our restaurant.

'We have taken this complaint very seriously and are conducting a thorough internal investigation and while this is happening have suspended the security guard in question.

'Our customer care team is in touch with Mr Dummigan.'

The spokesman said the alleged incident would not be in line with the chain's diversity policies.

He added the chain had apologised for the way in which Mr Dummigan was treated.

The incident happened just days after two BBC local radio DJs received homophobic abuse for holding hands as a social experiment.

Iain Lee and Justin Dealey posed as a couple in Luton, Bedfordshire, where passers-by said 'ugh' and 'disgusting' at them and one father ushered away his child.

'It certainly felt uncomfortable,' said Mr Lee. 'I know if you'd been a girl and I was holding your hand, there would have been nothing. I'm surprised and disappointed.'
