There seems to be no end of people queuing up to mock Kim Kardashian's Paper magazine cover, but one man decided that while he was there, he might as well imitate a few others.

Mina Gerges, from  Ontario, Canada, is the brain behind the Instagram account Keeping Up With Mina, and has recreated dozens of iconic celebrity images including Kim and Kayne's wedding and posted them on his account.

The Western University student, 20, prides himself on spending hours making everything for each hilarious image.

Mina said he wants to help people see overexposed celebrities in a new light, even highlighting the extremes to which A listers will go with Photoshop.

Every picture parody is a personal DIY project that takes around two hours. 

'I make everything myself,' he told Buzzfeed.

'I purchase curtains and hold them with pins, and everything else I put on them I stick with glue.'

On his Twitter biography, Mina describes himself as a 'Kardashian-obsessed third year media student'. 

The pictures, in which he copies the likes of Beyonce, Kim Kardashian, Nicki Minaj, Lady Gaga and Rihanna, have gained him nearly 40,000 followers on Instagram.

As a student Mina is on a budget and admits to searching the Dollar Store for props as well as raiding his own stockpile of make-up, jewellery and wigs.

He told Stylelist that he started the pictures about a year ago.

'I got to the point where I knew I needed to do something different. I wanted to recreate these photos, to have that hair, that make-up, and those outfits - essentially I wanted to be in the photo instead of pretending to be.'

He welcomes all reactions to his work, saying: 'I want to show people it's okay to do whatever if it makes them happy.

'I want people to see that there are others out there happy to support you through whatever it is you want to do, whether that's painting your nipples purple for a Rihanna impersonation, or whatever else you might be into.' 

The pictures showcase his ingenuity, such as using shredded paper to replicate Beyonce's frazzled bob on the Grammy's red carpet. 

Meanwhile in his Kim Kardashian parody photos, Kanye West is played by a giant slice of pizza.

When recreating Lady Gaga's clear plastic bubble dress, Mina substituted the orbs for half-filled white balloons and made a raffia wig, to send up the bizarre pop star.

One favourite is Nicki Minaj and Mina has recreated a variety of her photographs including her provocative pose naked in a bath of milk in which he used white blankets, carefully arranging them to protect his modesty. 

And it's not just Kim Kardashian who gets the Mina treatment - Kylie Jenner has provided new inspiration with her series of pouty selfies, which have sparked online debate about  her fuller-looking lips.

He added green extensions to his hair and painted a huge, clownish pink block around his lips to mock Kylie's  Instagram pictures.

But he's unashamed about his picture projects and recently tweeted: 'When someone hates on my pics i think 'What Would Kim Do' & the answer is to feel bad for them bc they're not as fab as us.'
