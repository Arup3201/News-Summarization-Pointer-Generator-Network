Hypothermia: Dorothy Spicer, 84, was missing from her care home for eight hours before staff noticed. She came down with hypothermia and later died

A care home was fined £140,000 after the death of a pensioner who staff failed to realise was missing for eight hours on a freezing cold November night.

Dorothy Spicer, 84, who suffered from 
Alzheimer's, was found the following morning lying in the grounds of the
 Whitefriars Care Home in Stamford, Lincolnshire.

Although she was suffering from hypothermia, staff waited 80 minutes before calling her an ambulance.

Mrs Spicer,  previously a lively women able to get around with the aid of a walking stick, never recovered and remained bed-ridden in hospital until she died two months later in January 2010.

The Order of St John Care Trust, which owns the home, admitted breaching the Health and Safety At Work Act by failing to ensure the safety of Mrs Spicer.

As well as the £140,000 fine, the trust - which is the second largest not-for-profit provider of care homes across the UK - was also ordered to pay £65,000 costs.

Passing sentence at Lincoln Crown Court, Judge Michael Heath said: 'In this case there were corporate, systematic and procedural failings which were ultimately a significant and substantial cause of Mrs Spicer’s death.

'The Trust fell far short of providing a safe standard. Serious injury or worse was plainly foreseeable. It is only a matter of good fortune that no tragedy occurred before that which befell Mrs Spicer.'

Bernard Thorogood, prosecuting, said Mrs Spicer was last noticed sitting in her usual chair in a communal lounge at the care home at 8.30 pm on the evening of November 25, 2009.

No-one saw her wander off and it was only at 5.20 am the following morning that she was found, still in her day clothes, lying in the gardens of the home.

The security alarm on the door she almost certainly walked through on her way out of the building had been disabled, which meant that staff were not warned of her departure.

'She was conscious but not coherent. An ambulance should have been called immediately but she was brought back in and attempts were made to warm her,' said Mr Thorogood.

It was only when day staff started to arrive that the emergency services were alerted and Mrs Spicer was taken to Peterborough Hospital where she was found to be suffering from hypothermia.

Her death on January 21, 2010, was directly attributed to the hypothermia which left her with restricted mobility and brought on pneumonia.

Mr Thorogood said: 'This was exposure of vulnerable residents of a care home to avoidable risks.

'The
 investigation found failings that were corporate, systematic and 
procedural. These were a substantial cause of the loss of Mrs Spicer’s 
life.

'There was a lack of 
adequate leadership. There was a failing by management at the care home 
and from higher up within the Trust.'

Staff complained they were under so much pressure they were not able to carry out a proper handover to the following shift and no head counts were carried out to establish that all residents were on the premises.

Mrs Spicer, a widow from Market Deeping, Lincolnshire, had been cared for by her two daughters before eventually going to live at Whitefriars two years before her death.

Both were in court to hear the Trust admit its failings.

Afterwards daughter Jane Howard, herself a care worker, said 'The total malfunction of that home is unbelievable.'
