Community spirit: Miriam Margolyes, Quentin Letts (right) and Bill Kenwright hunt for the nation's best amateur dramatic company

Essex bricklayer Steve Foster pauses with a lump of wet mortar on his trowel. After changing into character, the nasal-voiced, side-whiskered Mr Foster, 63, starts spouting Shakespeare.

'Mistress Ford,' he cries. 'I would thy husband were dead: I'll speak it before the best lord. I would make thee my Layydee!' And with that he throws back his head and gives a filthy, Sid-James-style laugh before returning to his wall.

Brickie Foster is one of Britain's large, neglected tribes: the amateur dramaticals. There are thousands of them up and down the land. Some act well, some appallingly. Some sew costumes, some paint backdrops, some do the make-up and some boss everyone around while directing the shows.

Britain's am-dram scene is lively, growing - but is often sneered at by the wider world. Am-drams? Oh, you say, that's ham actors standing with their feet at a 'quarter-to-three' angle in front of wonky props. That's prompters in the wings shouting lines at half-deaf thespians. How wrong you are.

Having just taken part - as the Mail's theatre critic - in a TV talent show about am-drams, I can tell you they're on a roll. Or rather, a role.

Steve Foster belongs to the Heath Players from Hatfield Heath on the Essex-Herts border. He is about to play Sir John Falstaff in an Essex take of The Merry Wives of Windsor (the wives are done up like ageing Spice Girls).

Fellow stalwarts in the troupe, which was founded in 1967, include a marine surveyor, a Vauxhall car dealer, a teacher and a civil servant.

That, anyway, is what they do by day. By night they become a host of characters. As the saying went on Matthew Kelly's Stars In Their Eyes: 'Tonight, Matthew, I am going to be . . .'

The same happens in Glasgow, where salesman Barry Ward is pumping himself up into a frenzy of sexual anger - in order (let it hurriedly be said) to play Hamlet.

Thirty-something Barry belongs to the Strathclyde Theatre Group, where his fellow actors include a dustman and a carer for the elderly.

Am-drams were last week pooh-poohed by London opera critic Rupert Christiansen, who wrote of 'self-managing, largely middle-class adult groups performing extant plays or musicals in the village hall or community theatre'. Pausing only to ask 'er, what's wrong with middle-class?', one has to conclude that the normally fair-minded Mr Christiansen is speaking out of his exhaust pipe.

When I signed up as a judge on Sky's Nation's Best Am Dram (along with impresario Bill Kenwright and actress Miriam Margolyes) I did not know what to expect.

Sky had invited the am-dram societies of Britain to submit audition tapes. The winner would get the chance to stage a production in London's West End - which, to am-drammers, is like getting to play a match at Wembley.

Entries were whittled down to a long list of 20. Some of the productions were, admittedly, as wooden as the Mayflower.

Some actors wore Ozzy Osbourne-style eye make-up to play Greek tragedy. Murdered by mascara! Some waved their hands in the air - woooo - like Pan's People. But some of the auditions were top rate.

For instance, West Yorkshire's Bingley Little Theatre had done a version of the witches scene in Shakespeare's Macbeth. This is a minefield even for professional actors.

There is always a danger, with all those toad and newt giblets, that the audience will start splurffing with laughter instead of feeling spooked.

Bingley's amateurs set the scene in a gay bar, casting the witches as three camp old men. Those taking part included NHS worker Jonathan Scott, 51, with an Ena Sharples-style hairnet on his head, who hissed and bitched to a high order.

The Royal Shakespeare Company would have been proud to call his interpretation their own.

The same was true when Crossmichael Drama Club, from Galloway, gave us their take on the 'mechanicals' scene from A Midsummer Night's Dream.

They did it in a strong Scots dialect which, far from making the scene incomprehensible, made it soar in the most unexpected way.

Nick Bottom and his mates can come across as clumping idiots with accents like Benny from Crossroads.

Here they were sparky rustics, eyes  a-gleam (with excitement and  terror) at the thought of doing some acting.

Crossmichael's members include a sheep farmer, a schoolmaster and a mother who is full-time carer for her disabled child.

These are time-starved people, yet they carve a few precious hours out of every week to devote themselves to the arts.

More than 2,500 am-dram groups belong to the National Operatic and Dramatic Association.

These are run by volunteers who come in after a day's work, grab a bite to eat, then dash off to rehearsals with a disparate band of neighbours.

Every few weeks, along comes show-night - the roar of the greasepaint, the smell of the crowd. And then the all-important cast party, where thirsts are quenched and romances may be forged.

'It's a cracking way to meet women,' laughs Steve Foster. 'Not at my age, though - that's long gone!'

Lusty Sir John Falstaff might not agree.

Hair-salon receptionist Tracey Challen, who acts with Dorset's Regent Rep, says am-drams are 'a massive part of who I am. Acting for me is the same as eating, breathing, sleeping.'

Sound engineer Bruce Downie, 44, from Glasgow, says directing the Strathclyde Theatre Group is the biggest thing in his life. Sitting in the group's theatre, he says simply: 'This is my real home.'

Having long watched the likes of The X Factor and Britain's Got Talent, I'd suspected talent shows whipped up participants into false states of emotion.

From my judge's seat on Nation's Best Am Dram, I saw genuine tears and cheers.

When the 20-year-olds from  Liverpool's Tell Tale community theatre company were told they had made it to the next round, they reacted like Premier League footballers after scoring a goal - though they did not rip off their shirts which, given the curvaceousness of some of the group's actresses, was just as well.

Why do people devote so much time to am-drams? Various reasons.

For Anne McIntyre, 44, director of Crossmichael, it is 'a release'. She has a disabled son at home.

'Drama gives me something else to focus on,' she says.

For mother-of-seven Janet Blizzard, from the Wirral, am-dram is a return to a life she had once hoped to follow before babies intervened.

'I'd like to think perhaps I could have made it as an actress,' says Mrs Blizzard, 55.

So is it all a middle-class self-indulgence? Tommyrot.

Am-drams embody the best of British community spirit. And I say that without the slightest need for a prompt.
