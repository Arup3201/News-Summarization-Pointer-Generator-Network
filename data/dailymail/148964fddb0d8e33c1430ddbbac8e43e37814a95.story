A University of Connecticut chemistry professor has been arrested after allegedly getting drunk and urinating in a parking lot before ripping side-view mirrors off luxury cars.

Gabriel Fenteany, 46, a Harvard graduate and father of two, was taken into custody on Monday by police at the university after a warrant was issued for his arrest.

He was visiting a resident in Greenwich on October 26 when he allegedly became drunk and walked through parking lots 'urinating, spitting, kicking, and ripping the side view mirrors off high-end cars', according to a police release.

Arrest: Gabriel Fenteany, pictured left in his mugshot and right in an image for the University of Connecticut, where he teaches chemistry, allegedly urinated in a parking lot and damaged a number of luxury cars

He allegedly damaged a 2014 BMW 328xi, a 2013 Audi Q7, a 2013 Audi TT RS, a 2004 Lexus ES330, a 2003 Lexus GS300, and a 2011 Honda Civic, the Hartford Courant reported.

Fenteany, from Vernon, faces charges of first-degree criminal mischief, second-degree criminal mischief, fourth-degree criminal mischief and second-degree breach of peace.

Fenteany was released on a written promise to appear in state Superior Court in Stamford on December 9.

The university has placed him on 
administrative leave and has prohibited him from campus until the 
investigations have been concluded, a spokesperson said in a statement.

Out of control: He allegedly got drunk while visiting a friend in Greenwich before walking through parking lots along this leafy street, urinating, spitting, kicking and ripping side view mirrors off high-end cars

Damaged: He allegedly damaged a 2013 Audi TT RS (pictured), as well as another Audi, a BMW, two Lexuses and a Honda Civic. He turned himself in after a warrant was issued for his arrest

He is an associate professor at the university. He earned his PhD at Harvard and his Master's and Bachelor degrees from the University of California, Santa Barbara.

According to The Daily Campus, this is not Fenteany's first brush with the law.

In June 2012, he was charged with disorderly conduct after allegedly throwing objects during a domestic dispute, hitting a woman and punching a man in the face, breaking his glasses.

Police had visited the home on two 
occasions previously; in one incident he was sent to the hospital for 
drinking and in the other, he was arrested.

His
ex-wife, Fiona Fenteany, has also previously signed an order of 
protection against him, ordering him to not contact or go near her, 
their two children and their animals, which he later allegedly broke.

Troubled: Fenteany, a divorced father of two, has reportedly been arrested in previous domestic disputes
