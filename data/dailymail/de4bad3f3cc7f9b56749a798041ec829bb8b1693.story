Ebola patient Ashoka Mukpo took to Twitter today to say he felt he was on the road to good health 

The health of Ebola patient Ashoka Mukpo appears to be improving after he returned to Twitter today to thank well-wishers for their 'good vibes'.

Mr Mukpo, 33, is being treated in a specialized quarantine unit at Nebraska Medical Center and last week received blood from Ebola survivor, Dr Kent Brantly, in his fight against the deadly virus. 

The patient posted on Twitter on Monday afternoon: 'Back on twitter, feeling like I'm on the road to good health. Will be posting some thoughts this week. Endless gratitude for the good vibes.'

Although Mr Mukpo had good news to reveal about his health, it emerged on a fundraising site this weekend that the 33-year-old is facing half a million dollars in medical bills. 

On a Gofundme page for Mr Mukpo, the message read: 'We are reaching out to help cover the enormous projected cost of Ashoka’s medical care, and to allow for his family to aid in, and properly support him during his recovery. 

'It is anticipated at this time that Ashoka's medical expenses and family support will exceed $500,000.' 

So far, the funds raised stood at just less than $48,000.

Mr Mukpo was flown out of Liberia on a special medical flight with a quarantine unit and has received round-the-clock care at Nebraska Medical Center

A fundraising page was set up for Mr Mukpo this weekend which revealed he is facing half a million dollars in medical expenses over his Ebola treatment  

Mr Mukpo was working as a freelance cameraman for NBC News in Liberia earlier this month when he contracted Ebola. 

He was flown back to the U.S. on October 6 and has been treated at the infectious disease facility in Omaha. 

His round-the-clock care and benefit from experimental treatment seem to have helped Mr Mukpo on the road to recovery - but he noted today the benefits of the pioneering treatment he had compared to what he had seen in Africa. 

He tweeted: 'Now that I've had first hand exp with this scourge of a disease, I'm even more pained at how little care sick west Africans are receiving.' 

He added: 'Be on the lookout for the Ebola Diaries blog coming soon. Will compile material from long-term reporter residents of Liberia.'

Mr Mukpo's condition worsened at Nebraska Medical Center last week, so doctors decided to try a previous technique of giving the patient a blood transfusion from an Ebola survivor. 

His immune system appeared to have benefited from the blood donation from Dr Brantly. 

The doctor, who beat Ebola after being flown back from Liberia to the U.S. in July,  raced to the nearest clinic in Kansas City, Missouri, while on a road trip last week to donate.

Mr Mukpo's fiancée, Helen Finlay, said last week that it was heart-wrenching to watch her boyfriend on four years battle the deadly virus and be unable to get close to him

Dr Kent Brantly was also flown back from Liberia to the U.S. after contracting Ebola during his missionary work for Samaritan's Purse.

He survived after receiving a dose of the experimental serum Z-Mapp and round-the-clock care at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. 

Those who have survived Ebola have antibodies in their blood which can help new sufferers beat the disease. Dr Brantly had earlier donated blood to a fellow doctor, Dr Rick Sacra, who also contracted Ebola during his work in West Africa and survived the disease.  

Mr Mukpo's father, Dr Mitchell Levy, told NBC that the family were deeply touched by Dr Brantly's selfless actions.

Dr Levy told the network: 'This act of kindness and generosity makes me believe in the goodness of humanity.'

Mr Mukpo also received the experimental drug Brincidofovir, which has shown promise in fighting the virus. 

The drug, developed by North Carolina-based Chimerix, is approved for the treatment of the herpes virus. It has never before been used on Ebola patients.

The fiancée of Mr Mukpo described last week the torment of watching him battle the deadly virus - but be unable to get close to comfort him.

British-born Helen Finlay described the experience as 'heart-wrenching', adding: 'I mean when you have a loved one who is as sick as he is, you want to curl up next to them and tell them you're going to be okay and be close to them and obviously you can't do that. It is a little bit hard.' 

Mr Mukpo's improving health came after a nurse, who treated Ebola 'patient zero' Thomas Duncan, was confirmed as having the virus this weekend. 

Nina Pham, 26, from Fort Worth, Texas, was one of the team of medical staff who treated Mr Duncan at the Dallas Presbyterian Hospital before he died from the dreaded virus last week.

She is now being treated in isolation at the Dallas hospital and is in a stable condition, CDC Director Tom Frieden said on Monday.  

Mr Duncan, a Liberian national, passed away from the disease last Wednesday morning. Mr Duncan, the first ever Ebola case diagnosed in the U.S., had also been receiving Brincidofovir.

Parents of Ashoka Mukpo, Lady Diana Mukpo and Dr Mitchell Levy, said last week that they were relieved to have their son back in the U.S. to be treated for Ebola

Thomas Duncan passed away last Wednesday morning after contracting Ebola in September. He was receiving the experimental drug Brincidofovir
