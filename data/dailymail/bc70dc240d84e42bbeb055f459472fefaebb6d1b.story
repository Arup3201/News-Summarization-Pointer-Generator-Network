The FA have scored an own goal in their anti-discrimination campaign by discriminating against their own inclusion advisory board.

Minutes published ahead of the last council meeting revealed that inclusion chairman Heather Rabbatts asked for her board to be given Wembley Suite VIP hospitality before matches.

Yet despite anti-discrimination measures supposedly being a priority for the FA, the protocol committee ruled that the inclusion directors should only be invited to the FA Community Shield, one of the least important fixtures.

Snubbed: FA made an error in snubbing Heather Rabbatts

Lord Herman Ouseley, chair of Kick It Out, called the decision ‘too stupid for words’ and a member of the inclusion board said: ‘It beggars belief. There are only seven of us and the Royal Box area has room for 400. You wonder what goes through the minds of these people, but it’s certainly not fighting injustices of all kinds.’

This snub came before Rabbatts’ committee had made clear to the FA board how concerned they were about FA referees’ chief David Elleray escaping proper punishment for making a racist comment. Yet, Elleray and chosen guests are  regulars in the Wembley suite for every match.

An FA spokesman said: ‘All independent committees of this type are treated the same.’

There is plenty of angst among those campaigning for UK Sport to return proper funding to basketball that Minister of Sport Helen Grant has not spoken out on the subject.

Basketball, despite failing UK Sport’s zero tolerance over Olympic medal potential, is a hugely popular team sport with a diverse following and Grant was expected to embrace the cause.

But, despite a number of requests, her public support has not materialised. Ironically, Grant has also been criticised on Tory blog site Conservative Home for pursuing tokenism targets but remaining silent on England’s World Cup debacle — despite travelling to Brazil on an official trip.

The FA’s ludicrous protocol committee showed once again that they care more about having their faces in the trough than anything else.

FA minutes report that before the FA Trophy final between Cambridge and Gosport ‘lunch commenced slightly later than scheduled’. No wonder FA  chairman Greg Dyke wants root and branch reform of the ‘increasingly irrelevant’ council body.

It was noticeable at the Test yesterday how little time Hampshire chairman and Rosebowl benefactor Rod Bransgrove spent with ECB chairman Giles Clarke despite a strong desire to host an Ashes Test in 2019.

Bransgrove has a dislike for Clarke, preferring even to host lunch with the awful Piers Morgan instead.

Coe ‘no’ to BBC role

Lord Coe is putting his beloved track and field before Government wishes that he becomes the next chairman of the BBC Trust.

Coe, PM David Cameron’s preferred candidate, did apply for the top BBC post but has decided to withdraw before the interview stage as he wants to prioritise his bid to succeed Lamine Diack as President of the IAAF in August 2015.

No: Lord Coe will not take a role at the BBC Trust

Coe, in Glasgow to watch the Commonwealth Games, said : ‘I did allow my name to go forward to give myself time to properly analyse whether I had enough time to do the job to the best of my abilities. On reflection, I haven’t the capacity and I now want to concentrate on my current  commitments and the IAAF election. As everyone knows athletics is in my DNA.’

Royal brothers Prince Andrew and Edward failed to make much of an impression on the Commonwealth Games.

The live BBC feed of the squash online name-checked Prince Andrew when the camera panned on to Edward and his family yesterday. When Edward arrived at the weightlifting on Sunday, the PA announcer welcomed Prince Andrew.

There is optimism that a Diamond League meeting in 2015 can take place in London’s Olympic Stadium next summer after a new roof has been installed.

The running track has been buried under nearly a metre of gravel during the major building works. Inspections show it has survived unscathed, although whether it is still suitable for top competition will not become clear until it is fully uncovered next Spring.
