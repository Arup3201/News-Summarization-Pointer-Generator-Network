A British couple spoke yesterday of their anger at Portuguese police for taking their two-year-old daughter away from them  outside a bar.

Stephen Street, 42, and Colette McPartland, 38, revealed that they had been reunited with Scarlett ten days after they were accused of being drunk and leaving her to play 100 yards away in the street.

Police at the time of the arrest said the couple ‘were too drunk to speak properly’. They added: ‘They showed absolutely  no concern for her welfare, so she was taken into care.’ Yet the parents say they have since been cleared of any wrongdoing.

'Shocked': Stephen Street and Colette McPartland told iTV's Daybreak they were hurt by the accusations

Some observers claimed Portuguese 
officers were acting overzealously following the case of Madeleine 
McCann, who disappeared while her parents were dining in a restaurant in
Praia da Luz.

In a TV interview yesterday, Miss 
McPartland said the ten days without Scarlett ‘were the hardest time in 
my  life – it was hell’.

She added: ‘It’s such a relief to have
her back. Luckily she’s a very easy-going, adaptable girl but she has 
been affected by this. She cries when I leave the room and she’s started
to need a dummy again, but I think she’s going to be her old self 
soon.’

Asked if there was any truth in the 
allegations that the couple were drunk in charge of their daughter, she 
said: ‘Not at all. I had two glasses of wine. I actually spoke to a 
doctor – I’m four months pregnant. She said two glasses of wine was ok 
and it was not risky to the unborn baby whatsoever. So I was not drunk 
and I was perfectly capable of taking care of my daughter.’

‘I wasn’t drunk either,’ added her 
partner. The couple, who moved to Portugal five years ago, had been 
drinking in a bar called the Manhas do Chocolate in a tree-lined square 
in the village of Carcavelos, 15 miles west of Lisbon, where they work 
as English language teachers.

They were at a table drinking white 
wine on a pavement terrace facing the busy two-lane street that runs 
through the middle of  the square.

Responsibility: Mr Street and Ms McPartland in the Portuguese town of Carcavelos 
after their daughter was taken into care. They claim they did not 
abandon her in the street while they went drinking

Miss McPartland, from Middlesbrough, said she had no idea why police chose to get involved.

‘It’s a bit of a mystery to us. There 
were lots of kids running around that area. Scarlett was never more than
a few feet away from us. We were watching her carefully all the time 
like any parent would.’

She told ITV’s Daybreak programme: 
‘She was never abandoned, she was never far away  from us, she was never
almost hit by a car, she wasn’t near a busy road ... almost everything 
that  was originally reported is completely untrue.’

Miss McPartland said she was unsure 
whether they would leave the country. ‘We were very happy here, but at 
the moment I don’t feel safe. I’m scared to leave the house and I’m 
scared that this could happen again.

‘We’re very shocked and hurt by all 
the things that have been said – they were completely untrue. If it 
hadn’t happened to us, I wouldn’t have even thought this was possible. 
We’re still in shock and I’m feeling very fragile right now.’

Mr Street added: ‘It’s not a nice feeling to realise that your children could be virtually kidnapped by armed people.

‘Social services have completely 
exonerated us. They have checked our backgrounds, talked to our 
neighbours, our crèche and our family doctor, so we have been completely
exonerated.’
