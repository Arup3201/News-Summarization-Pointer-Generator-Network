Danny Welbeck showed Manchester United what they may miss at Old Trafford with two goals in England's 2-0 win over Switzerland on Monday night.

The striker made his £16million move to Arsenal on the transfer deadline day, and the striker has already been labelled as a 'bargain' after his deadly brace on the international scene.

Here, Sportsmail take a look at seven England players that raised their game when playing for their country.

PAUL GASCOIGNE (Caps: 57 Goals: 10)

The midfielder had success at Tottenham and Lazio but his best moments all came on the international stage, including his breakthrough displays at Italia 90 and that goal against Scotland at Wembley.

SIR GEOFF HURST (Caps: 49 Goals: 24)

A stalwart for West Ham but Hurst’s career was defined by what happened at the 1966 World Cup, with four goals, including a hat-trick in the final, securing victory. Not bad for a third-choice striker...

EMILE HESKEY (Caps: 62 Goals: 7)

While his goalscoring record was never first-rate, his 11-year international career — and his partnership with Michael Owen during the 5-1 win in Munich — show his value.

JAMES MILNER (Caps: 50 Goals: 1)

Consistent without being spectacular, the 28-year-old midfielder has often struggled to hold down a regular spot for club or country. Yet his versatility makes him an asset.

JOE COLE (Caps: 56 Goals: 10)

Despite winning a lot of silverware at Chelsea, the midfielder’s best days came in an England shirt. He featured in three World Cups, including 2006 where he scored a superb goal against Sweden.

NAT LOFTHOUSE (Caps: 30 Goals: 33)

Despite making his debut at 25, the Bolton Wanderers legend went on to become the joint-sixth highest goal scorer in England history.

PETER CROUCH (Caps: 42 Goals: 22)

Some of the goals came against inferior opposition, but Crouch has the best goals to games ratio by an English striker in the past 20 years. In the League, he’s never reached the same heights.
