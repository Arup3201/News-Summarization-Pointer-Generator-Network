A pensioner died after he was forced to wait two hours for an ambulance, after suffering a stroke, despite living 100 yards from a hospital.

Trevor Bryer collapsed at his home in Llanelli, South Wales on May 6.

But despite three desperate attempts to call for help, his widow Karen Bryer was forced to watch her husband of 24 years deteriorate in front of her eyes.

Trevor Bryer died after suffering a stroke in May. He collapsed at home in Llanelli and was forced to wait two hours for an ambulance to take him to hospital, despite living just metres from the nearest A&E department

An ambulance finally arrived, having travelled more than an hour from Haverfordwest, 46 miles away, taking Mr Bryer to the Prince Philip Hospital, which is visible from the Bryer's home.

Two days later the 72-year-old former policeman lost his fight for life.

Offering their condolences to Mrs Bryer, the Welsh Ambulance Service Trust confirmed they have launched an inquiry into what happened.

Recalling the 'worst night of her life', Mrs Bryer said if she had been strong enough she would have carried her husband to the hospital, adding she thought about driving but hasn't been behind the wheel for years.

She said:  'I thought the best thing to do was to let the ambulance crew see him first.

'But we waited and waited. How is it that an ambulance took almost two hours to arrive?'

The 57-year-old said she is speaking out to ensure other families do not face the same heartbreaking ordeal.

Karen Bryer, 57, said she called 999 three times, the first time at around 8.30pm on May 6. She said an ambulance did not arrive until 10.20pm, after travelling for around an hour from Haverfordwest, 46 miles from Llanelli. The Welsh Ambulance Service has launched an investigation into what happened

NHS guidelines state that the most important care for people with any form of stroke is 'prompt admission to a specialist stroke unit'.

Stroke is the third biggest cause of death in the UK, with more than 110,000 people suffering a stroke each year.

The Act F.A.S.T. campaign, which launched in February 2009, urges people who suspect a loved one or friend has suffered a stroke, to dial 999 immediately.

The sooner a stroke patient receives treatment, the better their chances are of surviving and reducing long-term disability.

NICE guidelines dictate that a suspected stroke victim must be transferred to a specialist acute stroke unit within one hour.

The guidance also states a patient should receive a brain scan within one hour.

Ambulance services across the country treat suspected strokes as life-treatening calls.

'All I want is that some other poor person doesn't have to go through what he went through, or that someone is left there waiting, waiting, waiting, watching the person they love the most in the world going downhill like that.'

Mrs Bryer dialled 999 after her husband collapsed at home at around 8.30pm.

She claims she made two more emergency calls, approximately 25 minutes apart, as she waited for help. The ambulance eventually arrived at around 10.20pm.

She said she will never know if a faster response time would have saved her husband.

The Welsh Ambulance Service Trust has sent its condolences to the family and has confirmed an inquiry is under way.

Director of service delivery, Mike Collins, said: 'We extend our deepest condolences to the patient’s family at this difficult time.

'We have received a formal concern in relation to this and investigations are under way.

'We are liaising with the patient’s family directly and it would be inappropriate to comment further.'

Ambulance services across the UK categorise each call according to how serious the patient's condition is.

The aim is to ensure the most serious, life-threatening calls are dealt with first.

The categories are nationally agreed, by the Department of Health and each ambulance service across the UK are measured according to required targets.

- Red 1The most serious category, Red 1 is reserved for those patients who have suffered traumatic life-threatening injuries or those who are displaying the signs of suffering a heart attack or cardiac arrest.An ambulance is expected to reach a patient within eight minutes.Where possible two ambulance crews are dispatched to Red 1 calls - commonly a rapid response car, who can make initial assessments and start to treat the patient at the scene, followed by an ambulance, who can transport the patient to hospital.

Ambulance providers are required to classify all 999 calls according to the severity of the case. File picture

- Red 2The second most serious category is for all other life-threatening emergencies. Examples include patients who have suffered a stroke, with serious symptoms or those who are struggling to breathe.Similarly to Red 1 ambulance crews are expected to reach the patient within eight minutes of the 999 call being logged.

For both Red calls the response times are set out as national requirements rather than recommended times.

The guidelines dictate that an emergency response - usually in the form of a rapid response car - will reach 75 per cent of these calls within eight minutes.

Where onward transport to hospital is required, 95 per cent of life-threatening calls will receive an ambulance capable of transporting the patient within 19 minutes of the request being made.

- Green 1These are serious but not life-threatening calls, for example diabetic problems or a suspected stroke with no serious symptoms.A Green 1 call requires an emergency response within 20 minutes.

- Green 2Also deemed serious but not life-threatening, Green 2 calls can include suspected fractured arms or legs, or a patient who has fallen and maybe immobile.These calls require an emergency crew to be on the scene within 30 minutes.

- Green 3These are non-emergency calls which require an on-scene response within 60 minutes or an assessment over the phone from the clinical support desk within 20 minutes. A patient who has suffered a suspected overdose, but is showing no serious symptoms, or someone who has suffered a non serious injury would be classified as a Green 3 call.

- Green 4These are the least serious calls, which require emergency crews to be sent to the scene within 90 minutes or a telephone assessment within an hour.Minor scalding, a fall with no apparent injuries or someone in pain, but showing no serious symptoms would be classed as a Green 4 999 call.

Response times for Green calls are recommended and are set locally rather than being national requirements.
