To the millions of Benefits Street viewers, White Dee is the mouthy single mother who seems to fill her days chain-smoking and swearing on her doorstep.

But her image on the Channel 4 show is somewhat at odds with how she presents herself when looking for love on a dating website.

Self-proclaimed ‘mother of the street’, White Dee – whose real name is Deirdre Kelly – advertises herself on the Plenty Of Fish website as a blonde with ‘a few extra pounds’. She describes herself as ‘mean n moody – but nice!’ and lists her profession as ‘home maker’.

Looking for love: This is the picture 'White Dee' from Benefits Street posted on her online dating profile. On her page she wrote that she is a 'home maker' who is 'looking for fun n friendship'

Calling herself ‘Momma Dee’, the 
42-year-old reveals that she enjoys ‘hanging out with friends’ and her 
interests include: ‘Football watchin not playin, and drinkin tea.’

The
 profile, which was posted three years ago but is still active, features
 a blonde profile picture rather than the red hair White Dee sports in 
the documentary.

She tells 
prospective suitors: ‘Momma dee is looking for a relationship. Dont 
judge a book by its cover, u mite actually njoy wats inside. I am 
looking for fun n friendship. Take me as u find me, get to know me then 
make ur mind up, who knows what might happen.’

But friends of the now well-known reality TV star say she is already in demand with men.

One
 said: ‘She’s always attracted men with her big personality and dirty 
belly laugh, but since being on telly she can’t walk down the road 
without someone winding down the window and giving her a wolf whistle.

‘She’s received bouquets of flowers from admirers but hasn’t gone out with anyone in case they’re going to do a kiss-and-tell.’

Earlier
 this month MailOnline revealed that White Dee stole £13,000 while 
working at a local authority to fund her lover’s crack habit. The theft 
included cash given to social workers to look after by the ‘most 
vulnerable’ tenants.

White Dee declined to comment.
