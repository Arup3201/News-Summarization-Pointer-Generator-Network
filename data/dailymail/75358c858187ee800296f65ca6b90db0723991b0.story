Hurdler: John Deeds was filmed leaping over a garden fence, despite receiving disability living allowance on claims he needed help to rise from bed

A convicted fraudster who claimed it took him five minutes to stagger seven yards was revealed as a benefits cheat after he was filmed hurdling a garden fence.

John Deeds, 44, was awarded a high rate of disability living allowance on the grounds he was barely mobile.

He claimed he even needed help getting out of bed.

But undercover officials from the Department of Work and Pensions secretly filmed him after becoming suspicious about his claims.

Deeds, from Blackley, Greater Manchester, was caught on camera breaking into a jog before hopping over the a garden fence.

The nimble benefits cheat was also recorded climbing over the same fence while carrying a vacuum cleaner.

Other footage showed him cleaning a van and even pushing someone else in a heavy wheelchair.

The cheat has now been jailed for four weeks after pleading guilty to a charge of failing to notify the DWP of an improvement in his condition.

Deeds is already serving a 40-month sentence after being exposed as an identity fraudster.

Originally called Anthony Wolff, he changed his name by deed poll eight times and used a total of 17 different names to obtain goods and money worth £288,204.

Posing as a successful company boss, he duped a string of businesses into giving him credit on false pretences.

He admitted 12 counts of fraud, two counts of perverting the course of justice, and retaining unlawful credit.

As well as the jail term, to stop Deeds from carrying out future scams the Crown Prosecution Service and Greater Manchester Police secured a Serious Crime Prevention Order preventing him from being known by any other name.

The order bars Deeds from using other names, having more than one bank account, applying for credit or trade insurance or launching a lawsuit without first telling GMP’s fraud team.

The latest sentence, handed out at Manchester magistrates court, will run concurrently with the one he is already serving.

The court heard Deeds received benefit payments of £9,359 to which he was not entitled.

Lord Freud, minister for welfare reform, said after the case: 'We have a duty to the taxpayer and our customers to make sure that these vital benefits only go to those who need them. Benefit fraud takes money away from the most vulnerable.

'It is a crime and we are committed to stopping it by catching criminals and making sure our reforms make the benefit system less open to abuse.'
