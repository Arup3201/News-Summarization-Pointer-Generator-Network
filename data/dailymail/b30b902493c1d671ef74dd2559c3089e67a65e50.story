Two thugs left a man to freeze after pushing him in the world's third most dangerous river, in what was described as an 'aggressive' and 'homophobic' attack.

Serial offenders Kallum Crosby, 20 - who had been released from prison just one day earlier - and Jamie Norris, 22, attacked the 36-year-old man in January this year 'because he's gay', the court was told.

The two men, both from Hull, followed the victim to Victoria Pier as he left a club, before cornering him for his mobile phone near what is known as The Deep.

They then pushed him into the River Humber - considered to be the third most dangerous tidal estuary in the world - before going off to get a takeaway, where they bragged about what they had done.

Hull Crown Court was told the temperature at the time was 7 degrees and the victim could have easily suffered from hypothermia.

The man would have had just ten minutes to survive if the tide had been in and he'd gone underwater, the court was told.

Crosby - who has 48 previous convictions - and Norris both pleaded guilty to a charge of attempted robbery.

The judge told the defendants - who were both jailed - they were lucky they were not facing a homicide charge, considering the conditions on the night. 

During the hearing, prosecutor Philip Standfast told how the pair followed the victim, before trying to grab his phone.

They then told the man, who had left the club after a dispute with his partner, that he was 'going nowhere' - before rifling through this pockets and shouting 'You f****** queer!'

The duo then pushed the man into the river. Luckily, the men had not managed to grab the victim's phone - meaning he was able to call the police who came to his rescue.

Mr Standfast said: 'He landed in thick mud and was naked from the waist up. He could not move his feet and was covered in thick mud.

'It was dark and he was alone and he did not know where he was. He saw both of the defendants were laughing at his predicament.

'Fortunately they had not taken his telephone. He called police and the emergency services were fortunate in being able to find him in the dark and extract him from the mud.'

The victim was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary where he was treated for a cut to the eye and other cuts and bruises.

Meanwhile, the two men went to a takeaway restaurant in Hull's old town and boasted about what they had done, the court was told. 

Mr Standfast said: 'Crosby told a woman behind the counter they had just pushed a man in the river because he was gay.

'The assistant thought at first they were joking, but saw they had mud on their clothing.

'They said they had left him in the river and did not know if he had drowned. Crosby said they werenâ€™t bothered.

'The woman asked her his name and he told her and said he had just been released from prison.'

In a victim impact statement, the man said: 'I have suffered sleepless nights. The next day I was still in shock at what might have happened. I cannot stop thinking, what if?

'What if they had taken the telephone? I have suffered from sickness and for the first time in five years, I have had to take time off work.'

Crosby's defence barrister Chris Dunn said: 'This is one of those cases which make you shudder when you think of the catastrophic consequences that could have followed for this sort of behaviour.

'This could easily have been a homicide, fortunately the man had his phone.

'While I accept the incident may haunt the complainant there were not bad physical injuries. That was luck rather than judgement.

'When he is released he was thinking of becoming a fireman. I think the chances of that may have evaporated as a result of this offending.'

Norris's defence barrister Charlotte Baines said the trainee bricklayer had two young children aged two and three.

She said he thought about going in the Army, but quit after basic training at Catterick to join a relationship.

She said: 'He feels terrible and very sorry for what happened to the complainant.'

Judge Bury said it was aggravated because a man had been left in a life threatening situation.

He said: 'It was particularly aggressive and you were homophobic. You called him a 'f****** queer c***. You gave him a bear hug and then you pushed him in the Humber.

'If the tide had been in he would have been under water. You could see the situation he was in, but you both ran off laughing. You made no effort to help him.

'You went to a takeaway where you were laughing and boasting about it. You said you did not care if he was still in the water or not.

'He was targeted because of his 
sexuality. He was approached and lured down the pier.'

He sentenced Crosby to four and a half years in prison and Norris three years and nine months.
