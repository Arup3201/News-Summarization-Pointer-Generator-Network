Mario Balotelli was typically good value during Liverpool's training session on Friday - and Sportsmail can reveal that the Italy striker is the Premier League's best value-for-money summer signing.

The 24-year-old, who looks to make his  debut against Tottenham on Sunday, was bought by Liverpool for £16million and boffins reckon Brendan Rodgers got him on the cheap.

Analysts at Swiss-based CIES Football Observatory have placed ‘market values’ on top players from around Europe and they calculate that Balotelli was worth £30m, £14m more than Liverpool paid for him.

Mario Balotelli (Milan to Liverpool)

Paid: £16m Value: £30m (-£14m)

Diego Costa (Atletico Madrid to Chelsea)

Paid: £32m Value: £40m (-£8m)

David Luiz (Chelsea to PSG)

Paid: £50m Value: £24m (+£26m) 

This is based on a wide range of ‘objective’ factors from age and contract expiry date to position, performance data and international experience. 

Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp went further, saying Liverpool had a £45m player for £16m.

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers called the deal ‘outstanding value’, despite admitting that it was a risk signing the 24-year-old striker.

However, he took a punt due to Balotelli's age and match-winning ability. 

The striker looked to be getting along with his new team-mates, being hugged by new team-mate Lucas Leiva during the training session and was pictured on the ground having a laugh with more of his new team-mates.

It was a more impressive display at Melwood for Balotelli than on Wednesday, when he struggled to put on a bib.

Balotelli watched from the stands as Liverpool lost 3-1 to his former club Manchester City at the Etihad and will be raring to go at White Hart Lane on Sunday.
