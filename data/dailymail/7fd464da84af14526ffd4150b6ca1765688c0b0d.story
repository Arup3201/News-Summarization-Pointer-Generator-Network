An elderly woman who fell from a bridge into a river below was heroically rescued by two passers-by who used a shirt as a rope to help pull her to safety.

The woman was seen falling into the River Taff during Cardiff's rush hour from the bridge between Wood Street and Tudor Street, which is flanked by a stretch of waste ground.

In a lucky twist, one of the two men who rushed to her aid yesterday evening was an off-duty train conductor who knew first aid and had the keys to the gate giving access to the fenced off wasteland.

The drama unfolded at about 6.25pm when the woman, believed to be in her 60s, was spotted falling into the water.

The two men raced down the steep riverbank after they saw the woman fall from the bridge above

As they try to guide her out of the water, one of the men begins taking off his shirt

He then uses it as a makeshift rope which the woman uses to pull herself towards the riverbank

Once she reaches the two rescuers, the man who took off his shirt helps haul her to safety

She was heard to scream as her bag, containing her house keys and mobile phone, sunk in the water and she immediately began swimming.

'I saw her fall from the side of the bridge and she just went straight down and started to cry out,' said Helen Spanou, 43, from Cyprus, who was in town visiting her daughter.

'She was swimming a bit and then two men got over the fence and called to her to swim over.'

One of the two men then removed his shirt and used it as a guide rope to pull her to safety.

She said the woman was crying and appeared to be trembling from the cold.

Peter Brook, 35, an off-duty conductor with Arriva Trains, said he helped the other man, who did not wish to be named, to pull the woman to safety.

'She must have been in the water a good 10 minutes by the time we pulled her out.

'She had started to swim towards the train viaduct and I was worried she would go under it,' said Mr Brook, who lives at the nearby Century Court flats complex.

'Once we had her safe I checked that she wasn't taking any medication or had drunk anything and we tried to get her into warm clothes.

'The moment she fell I got on the phone to the emergency services and someone was on the scene quite quickly.'

While tending to her, he also sent his partner David Jones, 37, to their flat to get his work keys which gave them access to the gate closing off the wasteland.

It meant that when paramedics arrived they were able to take her away to be checked over without having to climb the fence.

Mr Jones added: 'We only got back to Cardiff today from a two week holiday in Orlando  and were walking back from Tesco after buying a few things to eat.

'The woman seemed to be quite well-to-do and had a nice bag apparently containing her house keys and mobile phone. That went under soon after she fell in.

'It's such a shame.'

A spokesman for South Wales Police said officers had received a report of a woman falling into the River Taff from a city centre bridge at 6.23pm.

'A passerby had managed to get her out of the water by the time we were on the scene. She was wet and in shock and was conveyed to the University Hospital of Wales by ambulance.

He added: 'She was assessed as being uninjured.'
