John Gleeson Sr. only wanted to teach his son a lesson by leaving him in a Long Island jail. But  weeks later the retired FDNY captain received the devastating phone call that John Gleeson Jr. had died while incarcerated.

'I didn’t bail him out,' Gleeson Sr. said. 'I said, ‘Let him get his act together.'

John P. Gleeson Jr., 40, was jailed on May 22 after being charged with petit larceny for stealing a manhole cover from an Oceanside parking lot.

John Gleeson Snr., his wife and his son John Gleeson Jnr: Before the tragic accident the family are ssen in this happy picture

Tragic loss: Family members say John Gleeson Jr., pictured here with his two children, died after Nassau County jail guards ignored his pleas for medical treatment while incarcerated

Family say Gleeson Jr. told prison guards that he had a medical condition and that such swelling showed it had reached life-threatening levels but was ignored

'He was down on his luck, trying to get scrap metal from abandoned 
buildings, whatever he could get his hands on,' his father told The Post.

He was then locked up in the Nassau County Jail.

On July 14, the younger Gleeson told the guards he was experiencing pain and swelling from his hands to his chest and neck.

He told them that he had a medical condition and that such swelling showed it had reached life-threatening levels.

After hours went by without treatment, Gleeson passed out and was rushed to Nassau County Medical Center.

He was pronounced dead at the hospital.

Repentant: Gleeson Jr., pictured here with his children, had struggled with opiates in the past but was described as 'contrite' and ready to move forward with his life by family members

His family received the news when a correction officer called their home and reached Gleeson's mother, Margaret.

Gleeson Sr. recounted the phone call: 'Are you John Gleeson’s mother?' 'Yes.' 'Well, he expired.'

'My wife started to scream and he [the man on the phone] said, ‘You 
want more information, call the Nassau County Medical Center,’ and he 
hung up,' Gleeson Sr. said.

The Nassau County Sheriff’s Department has not responded to requests for comment.

According to a family friend who works at the jail, the last hours of Gleeson's life were filled with terrible pain that went entirely ignored.

'They give him a Benadryl,' his outraged father told Mail Online. 'Then that doesn't work, an hour later they give him another Benadryl. He's sitting there in pain. I don't care what you did, you deserve to be treated like a human being.'

The family knew something was off when Gleeson Jr. did not call home at his normal 6:30 p.m. time, but it would be hours before they had any idea how bad the situation was.

Jailed: Gleeson's father, John Gleeson Sr., said he refused to bail his son, pictured, out of jail because he thought he needed tough love

Gleeson Sr. said that despite the fact his son was unable to speak he was not removed from his cell and taken to the hospital until 10:30 p.m. He was declared dead half-an-hour later.

Gleeson Sr. told Mail Online that over the course of his son's month-and-a-half incarceration, the tough love seemed to be working.

'He was clean and sober,' he said. 'He missed his kids. He was contrite, talking about how he wanted to put his life together.

'It's beyond obscene.'

Gleeson Jr. left behind a son John, 10, and a daughter Erin, 12.

He had previously been arrested for forging an oxycodone prescription and had struggled with opiate addiction.

Gleeson Sr. added that he has recently retained an attorney but that any potential legal action is still in early discussions.
