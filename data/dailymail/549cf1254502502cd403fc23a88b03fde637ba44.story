Grave charges: Laurel Schlemmer, 40, has been charged with homicide after telling police that 'crazy voices' told her to drown her two sons in the bath

The pastor of a Pennsylvania mother accused of drowning her youngest son and critically injuring his brother backed into the boys with her van 10 months ago, but everyone thought at the time that it was just an accident.

Laurel Schlemmer, 40, of McCandless, is being held without bond after she was arraigned early Wednesday on charges including criminal homicide, aggravated assault and child endangerment.

Schlemmer told Allegheny County detectives she heard 'crazy voices' telling her to 
push her sons underwater before she sat on the boys in the bathtub, 
drowning 3-year-old Luke and leaving 6-year-old Daniel in 
critical condition.

Allegheny County district attorney's spokesman Mike Manko announced Thursday afternoon that Daniel has no brain activity and is on life support.

The injured boy's status first emerged during a bond hearing Thursday for Schlemmer.

The woman didn't speak during the short video conference. Her attorney, Michael Machen, declined to comment after the hearing.

Schlemmer is in jail and on suicide watch. Her attorney got permission to have her evaluated by a psychiatrist.

The deadly incident comes less than a year after Schlemmer was questioned for nearly running over the two boys. She was never charged.

North Park Church Pastor Dan Hendley said that the van incident happened in the driveway of the boys' grandparents in a town near McCandless, where Schlemmer had been living with her sons.

‘There was no concern that there was anything but a terrible accident that occurred in that situation,’ Hendley said.

Family tragedy: Mrs Schlemmer confessed that she told her two younger sons, three-year-old Luke (far left) and six-year-old Daniel (far right) to get in the tub and then sat on them, believing she could be a better mother to her older son (center) with them gone

Tight-knit community: The deadly drowning took place in the Schlemmers' home in the 900 block of Saratoga Drive in upscale bedroom community of McCandless, Pennsylvania

Hendley said the family seemed to have
 bounced back well from the van accident, which he said caused internal 
injuries to Daniel and left Luke unable to walk for a time.

‘They seemed to be doing well from the distance from which I observed them,’ he said.

The
 pastor said there were concerns about Schlemmer's mental state as a 
result of that trauma, not because her friends or family had any 
suspicions about the van incident.

‘What was shared with me is she was in
 the van and the boys were behind her and she didn't see them,’ he said.
 ‘She thought the boys had run inside and, instead, they were in back of
 the van.’

Schlemmer also received a citation for leaving a toddler unattended in a parked car September 5, 2009, in nearby Ross Township.

Court
 records don't indicate which child was in the car, but police said the 
car's interior was 112 degrees when officers arrived. The child wasn't 
injured and Schlemmer paid a small fine, according to court papers.

Tragedy struck Tuesday morning after Mrs Schlemmer's 7-year-old son left 
for school.

She put the 
older boy on the bus at around 8.40am, then told the younger boys to 
take off their pajamas and get into the bathtub.

'Schlemmer
 said after the boys got into the tub she got into the tub "fully 
clothed" and "crazy voices" were telling her to push the boys down into 
the water,' the complaint said.

'Schlemmer explained that at one point she [was] sitting on top of boys while they were under the water in the tub.'.

Red flags: Mrs Schlemmer was suspected of trying to back over her children with her car last year, and in 2009, she was cited for leaving one of her kids in a hot car unattended

The
 detectives said Schlemmer went on to say that she 'thought she could be
 a better mother' to the oldest boy 'if the other two boys weren't 
around and they would be better off in heaven.'

Schlemmer
 pulled both unconscious boys out of the tub and laid them on the 
bathroom floor while she called 911. She told police she never attempted
 CPR because she did not know how to do it

Paramedics who responded to the colonial home in the 900 block of Saratoga Drive rushed Luke and Daniel Schlemmer to UPMC Passavant Hospital, where the younger boy was pronounced dead at around 10.50am.

His brother 
was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit at Children's 
Hospital of Pittsburgh at UPMC, where police said he remained in 
critical condition.

On a 911 call placed just minutes after Schlemmer had
allegedly drowned her children, the mother sounded halting but calm and extremely
polite, reported the Pittsburgh Post--Gazette.

'Um, my two sons,’ Schlemmer said, ‘I think that they’ve, they’ve drowned in our bathtub.’

During the five-minute conversation with the dispatcher, Schlemmer explained that she let her sons to play in the bathtub while she went to the restroom, and by the time she returned to check on them, both children were unconscious.

Later, the operator asked if the boys had anything in their mouths.

'Just water,' the mother replied.

'Happy' couple: Mrs Schlemmer worked as a teacher until 2004, while her husband of nine years, Mark, is an actuary; the couple have been very active in their church and have been described as 'strong Christians'

Word that the two little boys were found unresponsive stunned neighbors in the quiet, upscale bedroom community a few miles north of Pittsburgh. 

They described the family as religious and said Schlemmer was a stay-at-home mom whose husband, 43-year-old Mark Schlemmer, was working at the time.

According to Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the couple got married in 2005. Mr Schlemmer is employed as an actuary, while his wife worked as a teacher at Kerr Elementary School and Dorseyville Middle School in the Fox Chapel School District from 1999 until 2004.

The Schlemmers have been long-time members of the North Park Church congregation, where the wife had been attending Bible studies since her 20s.

‘They were a wonderful couple, strong Christians,’ Rev. Bob Shull, a former associate pastor at the church who officiated the Schlemmers’ wedding ceremony in 2005, told Pittsburgh Tribune Review.

Two bouquets of flowers were tucked Wednesday into a bush at the front of the family's home on a winding street of tidy split-level houses and manicured yards. Mourners also left a small stuffed leopard and a burning votive candle.

Schlemmer
 faces a preliminary hearing April 11. Other charges against her include
 reckless endangerment, aggravated assault and tampering with physical 
evidence, for allegedly hiding her wet clothes in a trash bag and then 
hiding that bag under three other bags.

Pastor
 Hendley and other friends at the evangelical Presbyterian congregation 
were working to help Mark Schlemmer, who is currently staying with a friend. The pastor said the husband was distraught but what happened, but not hostile toward his wife.

‘I'd question whether they're ever going to go back to that house given what's occurred,’ Hendley said.
