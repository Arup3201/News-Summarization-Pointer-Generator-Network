Firemen are to stage a wave of ‘cynical’ strikes over Christmas and New Year.

The Fire Brigades Union last night announced a string of further stoppages over the festive period in an escalation of its  long-running dispute with the Government over pensions.

The move came just 48 hours after a man died in a blaze in a flat in north London during the latest walkout by fire crews.

The Fire Brigades Union has announced planned strikes that will take place over the festive period

Fire Minister Brandon Lewis condemned the move, saying that firemen were already being offered ‘one of the most generous pension schemes in the public sector’.

Mr Lewis said: ‘The decision by FBU leaders to interrupt the Christmas holiday season with unnecessary industrial action is completely cynical.

‘I met with the FBU on December 4 to continue discussions but their actions today show that they are not serious about resolving this dispute, which simply further damages firefighters’ standing with the public.’

He added: ‘The deal on the table gives firefighters one of the most generous pension schemes in all the public sector.

‘A firefighter who earns £29,000, and retires after a full career aged 60, will get a £19,000 a year pension, rising to £26,000 with the state pension. 

‘An equivalent private pension pot would be worth over half a million pounds and require firefighters to contribute twice as much.’

The FBU said members in England and Wales will walk out for five hours from 7pm on December 24, for six hours from 6.30pm on December 31 and for two hours from 6.30am on January 3.

The move will raise fears about the safety of firework displays on New Year’s Eve and other celebrations.

FBU members in Scotland will also join the industrial action for the first time since the row flared, by joining in an overtime ban.

Between 7pm on December 27 and 7pm on the 29th, all firemen in the union across England, Wales and Scotland will refuse to work voluntary overtime.

The move comes just 48 hours after a man died in a blaze at a London flat during the latest walkout by firefighters

The union claims that members in their late 50s face the prospect of being sacked or seeing their pension reduced by almost half because of changes in the retirement age.

FBU chief Matt Wrack said: ‘Firefighters provide a first-class standard of service 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and these strikes will remind Government just how reliant they are on our members’ professionalism, commitment and flexibility.

‘However, there should be no need for industrial action and it’s absurd that firefighters’ concerns over pensions have not been addressed already.’ 

London fire chiefs were yesterday forced to defend their contingency plans after retired father-of-two  Richard Nicholson died in a blaze while union members were on strike on Saturday night. 

A neighbour raised the alarm at 9.52pm but striking firemen remained on their picket line until the four-hour walkout ended at 10pm. When they arrived at his ground-floor flat they found his body.

The FBU said the tragedy raised questions over contingency cover.

But James Cleverly, chairman of the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority, said going on strike put people’s safety at risk.

He said he believed the emergency services should agree no-strike deals, but added that it was ‘too quick and judgmental’ to conclude that Mr Nicholson had died due to the strike.
