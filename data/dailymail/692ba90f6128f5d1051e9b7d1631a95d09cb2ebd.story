Paul Scholes has criticised Joe Hart for appearing 'delighted' despite Manchester City's defeat by Barcelona which saw them crash out of the Champions League.

Hart was in inspired form at the Nou Camp on Wednesday as he pulled off a string of world-class saves to keep the scoreline down.

But Barcelona won the second leg 1-0 thanks to Ivan Rakitic's first-half goal as the Catalan giants progressed 3-1 on aggregate.

Writing in his column in the Independent, Scholes said: 'Well done to Joe Hart for a record number of saves in a Champions League game this season, and without him it would undoubtedly been worse for City.

'But what I could not get my head around was his evident delight at it all. Towards the end of the game he was smiling after every save and fist-bumping his defenders.

'City were losing 1-0. They were going out of the Champions League. What were they celebrating? Losing 5-0?'

City trailed 2-1 after the first leg at the Etihad and were fortunate not to concede more in Barcelona as Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar all went close.

Hart made a total of 10 saves and even Messi paid tribute to the England keeper.

'He saved everything,' he said. 'We had a lot of clear chances but the keeper had a brilliant game.

'We can only congratulate him, but the important thing is we achieved our objective to get through.'
