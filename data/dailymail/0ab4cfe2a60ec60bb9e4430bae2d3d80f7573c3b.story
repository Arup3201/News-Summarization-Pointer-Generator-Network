John Carver insists boardroom intervention did not play a part in the U-turn which has seen cancer-survivor Jonas Gutierrez return to Newcastle’s first-team squad.

The head coach said last week that the 31-year-old was not ready to play Barclays Premier League football having been given the all-clear from testicular for the second time in November.

Gutierrez responded to those comments by declaring earlier this week that it was down to the club’s board – owner Mike Ashley and managing director Lee Charnley – as to whether he played again.

The winger’s situation is complicated by a clause in his contract – which expires in the summer – stating that eight appearances this season triggers a one-year extension.

Newcastle allowed him to return to Argentina earlier this month for talks with former club Velez Sarsfield, only for those to break down at the last minute.

But now the Magpies say Gutierrez is fit enough to rejoin the senior set-up and will take his place on the bench for the first time in 15 months when they entertain Aston Villa on Saturday.

‘I know all the rumours have been out there about whether it’s Mike or Lee’s decision, but let me tell you, and let me put the record straight, I’ve had no conversations with either of them about Jonas, because I’m the one who picks the team,’ said Carver when pressed on Gutierrez’s claims.

‘I will be the one who decides if he is ready for it, and he is ready to go on the bench now.

‘He was just assuming that (the board were responsible). I don’t know why he said what he did but we’ve had the conversation now and I’ve put the record straight.

‘He obviously thinks that they’re making the decision, but it’s me, it’s my decision and it was a decision based on football alone.’

Politics aside, Gutierrez will be afforded an emotional welcome should he emerge from the bench.

And Carver believes his presence can lift a team whose season is in danger of petering out.

‘Listen, I’m telling you now, when we announce the team at the weekend and our fans hear that Jonas is on the bench, can you imagine the feeling in the stadium?’ he said.

‘There is going to be a feel-good factor.’ Carver added: ‘To actually come back and play in the Premier League again would be magnificent. He’s had a hard fight.

‘When I first saw him (in December) I was really concerned, but I suppose that’s natural because he has come from a serious illness.

‘Over the weeks he has got fitter and stronger. Yesterday, more than any other, I have seen the old Jonas Gutierrez, and that was the first time I’ve seen that.’

Gutierrez will almost certainly be released by United at the end of the season, seven years after signing from Real Mallorca.

But Carver has not closed the door on a new deal. ‘He’s been fighting his illness and also fighting for his career. In those terms it’s an important time for him,’ he said.

‘How long has he got left? Three months? So every opportunity he gets he’ll want to prove a point. Whether that is to us about getting a new contract, or whether it’s to go somewhere else.

‘That determination could be what drives him forward, but it could also help us.’
