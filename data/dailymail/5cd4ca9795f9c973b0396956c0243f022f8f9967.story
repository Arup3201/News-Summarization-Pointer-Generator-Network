Australia's civil aviation authority is looking to introduce 'world-first' rules surrounding the use of drones after an increase in them being flown 'inappropriately'.

The rules currently in place were introduced in 2002 and do not reflect the changes in technology, Civil Aviation Safety Authority spokesman Peter Gibson told Daily Mail Australia.

Drones must be kept more than 30 metres away from other people and must not be flown over public places where a large number of people are gathered such as the beach or sporting events.

The devices - which can come with GPS systems and cameras - can only be operated during the day and within line of sight.

They should also be kept more than five kilometres away from airports and must not be flown above 400 feet.

If these regulations as well as others are violated, infringement notices may be issued or prosecution may be sought where people have been injured.  

Mr Gibson said 12 years ago recreational use of drones simply did not exist and it was time the authority addressed this growth.

'There are 180 commercial operators and probably tens of thousands of recreational drones out there,' he said. 

'We need to update them and bring them up-to-date with usages.'

Australia was the first country to introduce rules around drones and regulations coming in next year would be a 'world-first'

Mr Gibson said an increase in incidents involving drones had also sparked the authority to update their policies.

'We are getting regular incidents happening where drones are being used inappropriately,' he said.

'Near Christmas there was a police operation in Melbourne and someone flew a drone which hit a power line and it almost fell on a police officer. We need to take [incidents like] that into account as well.'

Mr Gibson was unable to comment on specific changes but he said they would be practical and enable recreational users the ability to still have fun.

'It's early days and we're in the process of developing proposals and we’re going to do public consultation,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'But the key to it would be making the rules as practical as possible for your average recreational drone owner, while obviously trying to get the right safety outcomes. 

'We're not trying to stop people flying around their drones in the park or the beach or in the paddock. 

'They are great fun to fly and relatively speedy. We're trying to get right set of rules to protect aircraft in the air and those on the ground.'

The introduction of these rules in Australia would set a precedent for the rest of the world.

'The United States don't have any rules... so we are very much ahead of the game here,' Mr Gibson said.

'We were the first country in the world to have rules around drones.'
