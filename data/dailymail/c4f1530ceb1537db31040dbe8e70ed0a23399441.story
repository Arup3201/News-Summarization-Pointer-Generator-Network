Playboy covergirl Brandi Brandt has been jailed for more than three years for conspiring to import cocaine on planes bound for Australia.

Brandt, best known for her failed marriage to Motley Crue bassist Nikki Sixx, was involved in a brazen US-Australia cocaine importation syndicate that hid packages of the drugs in toilets on Los Angeles passenger planes bound for Sydney in 2007.

She pleaded guilty to conspiring to import more than two kilograms of the drug and transferring more than $70,000 into bank accounts over the sale.

In sentencing the mother of three on Friday, Judge Peter Zahra told the Sydney District Court that her role in the criminal enterprise was 'substantially lower' than her co-accused, including former lover and stuntman Rusty Setser.

He could not be satisfied, he said, that she ever touched the drug packages or was aware of the quantities involved.

Mr Zahra said the 45-year-old's childhood had been beset with drug use.

Her mother, Maria 'Brie' Darling, was a musician and as a child Brandt was surrounded by drugs.

He said by the time she was 12 or 13, Brandt herself had begun to abuse drink and drugs, and went off to live with her father.

While she was sober during her marriage to Sixx, the court heard the relationship's breakdown saw her return to drugs and alcohol.

The former Playboy was extradited to Australia after being accused of playing a role in a US-Australia cocaine importation syndicate.

Her subsequent relationship with Setser was marred by violence and heavy drug use, with Brandt telling a psychologist he was a 'ticking time bomb' and that he encouraged her to 'use more'.

She was found guilty for conspiring to import cocaine for a brief period in November 2007.

By 2009, Brandt was aware that authorities were interested in her and the fear of arrest was a 'significant emotional burden', Judge Zahra said.

She was finally extradited from the US to Sydney in 2013 to face charges for her role in the cocaine-trafficking syndicate.

Judge Zahra said she had good prospects of rehabilitation and was unlikely to reoffend.

She will be eligible for parole in November 2016.
