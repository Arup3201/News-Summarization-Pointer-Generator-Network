McBusted star Harry Judd has today urged people to be more aware of their hearts after he was diagnosed with an irregular beat while training for a marathon.

The drummer first noticed something was wrong two weeks before he was due to line up for the start of the Virgin London Marathon last April. 

The Strictly Come Dancing 2011 champion said it was only at his wife Izzy's behest that he went to see his doctor.

Tests revealed Harry had an ectopic heart beat -  where the heart produces an extra beat.

The drummer, pictured with his bandmates, was cleared to take part in the marathon by his doctor, who told Harry the condition is common in athletes 

Despite his diagnosis, Harry went on to complete the marathon, crossing the finish line in three-and-a-half hours, and has since seen signs of the condition disappear.

But he urged people to be aware of their heart health, encouraging those exercising to use a new heart rate monitor that sits on a person's wrist like a watch. 

He told MailOnline: 'I was doing the marathon last year and I was training way too hard, as it turned out.

'I was also interval training as well, I just thought if I was going to do it, I would do it properly, especially given I was asking people to sponsor me.

'So I really went for it.'

But two weeks before the marathon, Harry said he noticed what felt like a twitch in his chest.

'The first time I noticed something was wrong, I felt something like a twitch, in my peck muscle. I remember thinking it was really weird,' he said.

'It then started to feel like my heart was fluttering, too quickly.

'But I didn't want to say anything to worry people.'

After finally telling his wife, Izzy, the McBusted star said she 'totally freaked out', urging him to visit the doctors.

It was after he was referred to see a heart specialist that he was diagnosed with the condition. 

'Eventually I did say something to my wife, who totally freaked out, understandably,' he told MailOnline.

Harry told MailOnline: 'The first time I noticed something was wrong, I felt something like a twitch, in my peck muscle. I remember thinking it was really weird'

Not wanting to worry anyone the McBusted drummer said he waited a few weeks before telling his wife Izzy, pictured. It was at her behest that the star went to see his doctor

'I went to see a heart specialist who basically performed a series of tests on me, while I was wearing a pacemaker.

'It was then I was diagnosed with an ectopic heart beat. It is quite a common condition among athletes.

'It was kind of scary at first. It is hard to explain. When you become very fit and healthy your resting heart beat is very low therefore it can become too low.

'While it was a scary diagnosis, we were reassured. My doctor told me I was ok to run the marathon.'

After crossing the finish line in three-and-a-half hours, and calming his rigorous running regime, Harry said he noticed the condition disappeared.

'I am absolutely fine now, when I stopped the marathon the fluttering feeling just disappeared,' he told MailOnline.

'My doctor said that should be the case, once I stopped training so hard. And thankfully there have been no repercussions.

'I have been warned that I am likely to be prone to the condition, but now I will be more aware and keep an eye on it.

'It has made me more aware of how hard I pushed myself, and how I pushed it to the extreme.'

Epson has today announced it is launching a new series of products aimed at runners.

Harry told MailOnline the new technology would've been a 'godsend' when he was suffering his heart condition. 

While there are a number of similar products available, Harry said the Pulsense product combines readings 24 hours a day. 

It measures calories burned, sleep quality and exercise across five heart rate zones as well as recommending daily goals to help towards weight loss targets.

Harry said: 'I am absolutely fine now, when I stopped the marathon the fluttering feeling just disappeared... Staying fit and healthy is not just about exercise, it's a lifestyle thing'

'Heart rate monitors are traditionally worn around the chest and are a bit of a pain,' he said.

'But this new product is amazing, it is worn as a wrist watch and you don't have to wear anything else.

'I could've really done with it when I was training.

'Staying fit and healthy is not just about exercise, it's a lifestyle thing.

'The monitor can tell when your heart rate is elevated and records it even when you're not moving.

'It takes readings 24 hours a day, even when you are sleeping.

'It is really interesting, not just in terms of seeing how your heart rate is affected by exercise, but looking at readings while you're asleep and resting as well.

'It is amazing to think I can record my heart rate during really active periods, when I am doing sport and I am really looking forward to wearing the monitor when I am drumming.

'It is the perfect thing for me.'

Robert Clark, vice president of marketing at Epson Europe, said there has been an increasing demand for wearable products, to fit in with people's lives 

'It is important that Epson innovates and moves with these exciting times. Devices that monitor a person’s activity are growing in popularity and we see great future potential in this market,' he said.

'Since we first began developing optical heart rate sensing products in Japan, we have been able to refine and minimise the technology to create a range of products that can outperform and offer more benefits than those currently on the market. 

'Through our rich manufacturing heritage, we have developed a truly unique proposition that will contribute to the long-term success of Epson.'

Harry raised more than £50,000 for The Teenage Cancer Trust and the Brain Injury Rehabilitation Trust running the marathon.

An ectopic heart beat is not a missed beat, rather an extra beat of the heart.

After this extra beat there is often a pause which makes can feel as though a sufferer has 'missed' a beat. 

What causes ectopic beats?

The electrical system of your heart is controlled by the heart’s pacemaker which is a group of specialised cells called the sino atrial node (SA node). 

The SA node is in the right atrium - the top right chamber of the heart and is one of the four chambers of the heart. 

An ectopic beat happens when the cells in another part of the heart create an electrical discharge, causing an ‘extra’ heart beat. 

What are the symptoms?

A person with an ectopic heart beat might be aware that their heart has ‘missed’ a beat or feel it is thumping or pounding in the chest.

A sufferer may feel a sensation of the extra beat in their ears or sometimes in the neck. When experiencing a few ectopic beats together, people report feeling a ‘fluttering’ sensation in their chest.

Ectopic beats can be frightening but do not usually cause other symptoms.

How common are they?

Ectopic beats are common and most of the time people will be unaware of them. They usually happen when the heart is beating slower, for example at night or when you are relaxing.

They can happen to anyone at any age whether you have heart disease or not.

Are they dangerous?

If a person are in good general health, ectopic beats are unlikely to be a problem. They can happen just occasionally in a regular pattern, or a sufferer may feel several happen at once and then stop.

If a sufferer has also been diagnosed with coronary heart disease, it is important to speak to a doctor about any change in the pattern or rate of the heart beat.

What can trigger ectopic beats?

When a person is stressed or feeling very anxious, it can trigger an ectopic beat. This is because adrenaline and other hormones are produced by the body in times of stress and anxiety and may make ectopic beats more forceful or obvious to you.

An ectopic heart best is when a person experiences an extra beat of the heart, which can feel like a flutter in the chest. Sufferers can also experience thumping or a pounding of the chest

A person may notice an ectopic heart beat if they:

How is the condition diagnosed? 

After taking amedical history, a doctor may refer a person complaining of an ectopic heart beat to have an electrocardiogram (ECG). Not all ectopic beats show up on an ECG, especially if they only occur every now and again.

If symptoms persist further investigations including a 24-hour ECG recording can help diagnosis.

How are ectopic beats treated?

Ectopic beats in healthy people do not need to be treated unless they are causing symptoms.

Identifying what triggers the ectopic beats can be helpful. By avoiding the trigger, it may be possible to eliminate the extra beat. For example, limiting the amount of caffeine and alcohol, stopping smoking may all help you to reduce the frequency of ectopic beats in some people. Exercise often helps those who are physically inactive.

Dealing with anxiety and recognising what may trigger the ectopic beats can also help you to deal with them.

There are no vitamins or food supplements that have been shown in research to stop ectopic beats completely.
