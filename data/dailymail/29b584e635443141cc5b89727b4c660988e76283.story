A teenager has died and another is on life support after they collapsed following drug overdoses at a dance festival in Sydney at the weekend.

The 19-year-old man collapsed on the dance floor after taking ecstasy on Saturday night at the A State Of Trance dance festival at Sydney Olympic Park.

Medical staff tried to treat the teenager at the event, but he was rushed to hospital in a critical condition and later died. 

Police believe party-goers at the festival were playing a dangerous game to see who could take the most pills.

Investigators are now working out whether the teenager was involved. Police believe he took an 'excessive number of pills'.

Four other men were also taken to hospital from the same event after police believed they had consumed illicit drugs.

A 22-year-old man allegedly told medical staff at the event he had taken a large amount of pills, while police say a 20-year-old man remains on life support after being rushed to hospital following an overdosing at the festival. 

It is understood his parents did not know he was at the dance party. 

A young woman who witnessed the 19-year-old being taken out by medical staff told Daily Mail Australia his face was 'very pale' so she knew 'it was pretty bad'.

More than 16,000 people attended the dance festival on Saturday and police say they made no secret of a high-visibility drug operation. 

Among those to play at A State of Trance in Sydney was Dutch DJ Armin Van Buuren. 

Three people were arrested for supplying drugs and 40 other charges were laid for drug possession and other offences. 

Drug dogs searched about 180 people and a total of 23 patrons were treated by medical staff. 

'Despite efforts by police and the event organisers to ensure people could attend this music event and enjoy themselves without their lives being put in danger, one man has died and another remains in Westmead Hospital in a critical condition,' Assistant Commissioner Frank Mennilli said. 

'NSW Police will continue to use drug dogs and search people at events if we believe they are carrying illegal drugs. If you carry and supply illegal drugs you will be arrested.'
