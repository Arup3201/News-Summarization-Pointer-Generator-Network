An amazing time-lapse video has squeezed the Mars Curiosity rover's nine-month mission into just one minute of viewing.

The incredible clip is the work of Karl Sanford, of Grand Rapids, Michigan, who claims that it's his first time making such a video.

Downloading the raw images from the Curiosity website, Sanford arranged the photos from the rover's front left hazcam and into an MPEG format. He uploaded the video to YouTube on May 22.Â

Mr Sanford also includes a link that provides the code he used to make the clip on GitHub.com.

His video has been making the rounds on social media, and even Curiosity itself posted the YouTube link on its official Twitter account.

Since then, it has gotten about 227,000 hits on the video-sharing site.

Curiosity landed on Mars on August 6, 2012, and has spent its time investigating and analyzing the landscape and geology of the red planet.

Last week, the rover used a drill on its robotic arm to collect a powdered sample from the interior of a rock called 'Cumberland.' The sample is now being examined in Curiosity's on-board laboratory.

In March, data from Curiosity revealed that a rock located near the Gale Crater landing site contains all the chemical ingredients necessary for microbial life, the over-arching goal of the planned two-year mission.

Scientists are eager for additional information about the rock sample, which was drilled out from what appears to be a slab of bedrock in an area known as Yellowknife Bay.

They have identified sulphur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and carbon - some of the key chemical ingredients for life - in the powder Curiosity drilled out of a sedimentary rock near an ancient stream bed.

The $2.5billion rover landed on Mars on Aug. 6 to assess if the planet most like Earth has or ever had the chemical ingredients and environments for microbial life.

Scientists eventually plan to drive the rover to a 3-mile (5-km) high mound of what appears to be layered sediment rising from the floor of Gale Crater.
