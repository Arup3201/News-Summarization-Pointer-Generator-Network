Iowa gun laws are careful not to deny firearm permits to any resident based on physical disability, even if they’re legally blind.

Blind applicants are allowed under state law to purchase weapons and carry them in public, even if they aren’t allowed to hold a driver’s license or are unable to read the application form.

While some sheriffs have been granting gun permits to people with visual impairments, others have been denying them  despite a 2011 law that gives blanket rights to hold such permits to all physically disabled Iowans.

Shoot 'em up: An Iowa law that gives blanket rights to carry guns to otherwise eligible physically disabled persons is forcing county sheriffs to issue permits to the blind

‘It seems a little strange, but the way the law reads, we can’t deny them (a permit) just based on that one thing,’ Sergeant Jana Abens, a spokeswoman for the Polk County sheriff’s office, told the Des Moines Register.

County officials said they have issued at least three permits to people who can’t legally drive and had trouble reading the application.

Other counties have also issue permits, while others have not.

‘I’m not an expert in vision,’ Delaware County Sheriff John LeClere said. ‘At what point do vision problems have a detrimental effect to fire a firearm? If you see nothing but a blurry mass in front of you, then I would say you probably shouldn’t be shooting something.’

Getting technical: Even if the person can't drive a car or even read the permit application, the word of the law grants them the right to apply for a gun permit

Helpless: Some Iowa county sheriffs have acquiesced to the laws, while others have not. 'we can¿t deny them (a permit) just based on that one thing,' said Sgt. Jana Abens with the Polk County Sheriff's office

A man interview by the Register disagreed.

Michael Barber, who is blind, was shopping at a gun store in Iowa when he gave the paper his two cents.

'When you shoot a gun, you take it out and point and shoot, and I don't necessarily think eyesight is necessary,' Barber said.

It's not clear how many people with visual impairments have permits to carry weapons in Iowa because no one collects that information, but some advocates for the rights of the blind maintain that there should be no question—the blind should be allowed to carry firearms.

Following the law? Dubuque County Sheriff Don Vrotsos said that, if a blind person came to his office for a permit, he or she would be denied

‘The fact that you can't drive a car doesn't mean you can't go to a shooting range and see a target,’ said Jane Hudson with Disability Rights Iowa.

Hudson said keeping legally blind people from obtaining weapon permits would violate the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Some other states, including Nebraska, require anyone applying for a gun permit to provide proof of their visual ability by supplying a driver's license or doctor's statement.

Hudson said she thinks someone could successfully challenge Nebraska's vision restriction because federal law requires states to analyze a situation individually before denying a service.

Even Patrick Clancy, superintendent of the Iowa Braille and Sight Saving School, said guns may be a rare exception to his philosophy.

‘Although people who are blind can participate fully in nearly all life's experiences, there are some things, like the operation of a weapon, that may very well be an exception,’ Clancy said.

Some other states, including Nebraska, require anyone applying for a gun permit to provide proof of their visual ability by supplying a driver's license or doctor's statement.

Wild guess: County sheriffs can guess at how many permits they've issued to the blind, but its a statistic no one keeps track of, so no one knows how many blind Iowans currently carry firearms

Some county sheriffs are issuing such permits, while others refuse but some advocates say denied blind applicants could easily win appeals
