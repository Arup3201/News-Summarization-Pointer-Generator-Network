Lily Allen is the queen of cool in a new fashion campaign modelling for her best friend and famed fashion designer, Henry Holland.

The pop star was hand-picked by the British designer to front his bold new eyewear campaign - and he says she's the ultimate House Of Holland girl in the punchy new imagery.

The mother-of-two, 29, rocks peach hair as she models the retro eyewear range against a backdrop of sugary pastels.

Wearing her signature bangs and a smear of winged eyeliner, Lily says she 'jumped at the chance' to be involved in the campaign.

'I have been a friend of Henry’s and fan of HOH for years' she said. 'I jumped at the chance to be involved with the campaign. I feel lucky to be able to continually collaborate with HOH for both my stage wear and life wear; they smash it like no one else can.'

The collection itself boasts eight new styles in bold colourways and signature styles include a neo-80’s take on the classic cat’s eye frames named 'Mossy' after Henry's close friend Kate Moss.

Henry describes the collection as his favourite yet, saying: 'I love all the styles and feel like we have achieved some killer frames.

'Lily was the right choice as we have been collaborating a lot over the last year and it’s always fun to work with friends. Shooting with Danielle Levitt was the icing on the cake and the results are – in my opinion - f’ing mega.'

Lily has been spending time in sunny  Los Angeles this month and was seen enjoying lunch with her ex-boyfriend, Seb Chew.

Lily and Seb, who she has remained friends with since they dated for two years before splitting in August 2007, were seen grabbing lunch together at Canter's Deli in the city, before going their separate ways. 

She's currently in Los Angeles recording music, and is also thought to be house-hunting over there to relocate with her husband Sam Cooper and their daughters Ethel Mary and Marnie Rose.

She also recently toured the States, and also mingled with Hollywood's finest at pre and post-Oscars parties in mid-February, in honour of the most prestigious movie awards ceremony of them all.
