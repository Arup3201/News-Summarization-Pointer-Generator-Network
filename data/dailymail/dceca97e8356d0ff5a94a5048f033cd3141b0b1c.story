Thousands of commuters will see rail fares double today.

Changes imposed by the Government on the main rail company in the north of England mean some people will be paying 162 per cent more than they did on Friday.

Commuters in Chancellor George Osborne’s constituency of Tatton in Cheshire will be among the hardest hit, along with travellers in Nick Clegg’s Sheffield Hallam seat.

The Chancellor George Osborne (above) said fare increases would be capped at 2.5 per cent but this will be of little comfort to Northern Rail customers facing ‘stealth’ rises

Mr Osborne chose yesterday to announce that countrywide fare rises planned in January will be limited to 2.5 per cent – not 3.5 per cent as previously thought.

But the cap will be of little comfort to Northern Rail customers facing ‘stealth’ rises from today.

The increases come as the Government forces Northern Rail to introduce evening peak ticket restrictions on local services. This is to plug the gap caused by the cost to the taxpayer of the West Coast franchise saga in 2012.

From today, off-peak tickets will no longer be valid on some trains between 4.01pm and 6.29pm on weekdays, which means sharp increases in some fares.

A day return from Styal in Tatton, Mr Osborne’s constituency, to Manchester is £7.90 instead of £5.20, an increase of 52 per cent.

And a day return from Dore and Totley in Sheffield Hallam, Nick Clegg’s seat, to Sheffield will be £3.30, up 43 per cent from £2.30.

Someone travelling from Rochdale to Wigan will pay £11 for a day return, an increase of 162 per cent.

A spokesman for the Department of Transport said: ‘These changes will help us achieve our long-term plan of building a rail network that is better for the passenger and better value for the taxpayer.

‘Such restrictions are relatively common on other parts of the network, including in the Merseytravel area, and we expect only a minority of passengers to be affected.’

Labour’s transport spokesman Mary Creagh said: ‘This is a direct result of the Government’s West Coast franchise fiasco and commuters travelling to Leeds, Manchester, Bradford, Sheffield and Newcastle are paying the price.

‘People shouldn’t have to choose between paying more or waiting until after dark to travel.’ She called for a strict cap on fare rises and reform of the railways.

The botched franchising of the West Coast line cost taxpayers more than £50million and meant the Government had to negotiate extensions to existing franchises, including Northern Rail. Yesterday, Mr Osborne announced the annual New Year fare rise will be 2.5 per cent, not 3.5 per cent.

This year’s July RPI inflation figure meant that regulated fares would have risen by an average of 3.5 per cent in January 2015.

Mr Osborne is also scrapping the ‘flex’ system where companies could raise some fares by up to two percentage points. He said more than 250,000 season ticket holders will save £75 across 2014 and 2015.

But Mick Cash, acting general secretary of the RMT transport union, said: ‘The announcement from George Osborne does not stack up to a freeze for millions of people whose incomes are stagnant due to austerity.’
