Chelsea 

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has an almost fully-fit squad to choose from for Tuesday's Capital One Cup semi-final first-leg clash with Liverpool.

The Blues were convincing in a 5-0 win at Swansea on Saturday and Mourinho could rotate his side for the trip to Anfield.

Thibaut Courtois could return in goal having sat out the last three games with a minor finger injury but Cesar Azpilicueta (groin) is likely to miss out, whilst the likes of Kurt Zouma, Loic Remy and Andre Schurrle will be hoping for rare starts.

Provisional squad: Courtois, Cech, Ivanovic, Luis, Cahill, Terry, Zouma, Ake, Fabregas, Matic, Ramires, Oscar, Mikel, Willian, Hazard, Schurrle, Salah, Remy, Costa, Drogba.
