A new report recounts in chilling detail how the Boston bombing suspects were hoping to add to their arsenal when they allegedly murdered young police officer Sean A. Collier with five gunshots. 

Collier, 27, was about to start a new job with the Somerville Police Department when he was killed.

Friends and family described him as born to be a police officer.

'He came to see me a couple of months ago and he said, ‘Chief, I have
a chance to get on the Somerville Police,'' MIT Police Chief John 
DiFava told the Boston Globe. 'I said, ‘Sean, you owe me nothing. You’ve done a fine job for 
me. I would never stand in the way of someone trying to do better for 
themselves.’'

On the night Collier died, he was on duty near Kendall Square in Cambridge.

DiFava had ordered extra campus security in the wake of the bombings. Collier joined the MIT force in early 2012 and was reaching the end of a 3 to 11:15 p.m. shift.

By 9:30 p.m. he was on routine patrol, parked in the corner of Vassar and Main streets.

Collier, who's lifelong dream was to be a cop, was set to join the Somerville Policed Department

Police still have questions about why the suspects were at MIT and what attracted them to attack Collier

The spot gave him a vantage point to 
see where drivers might commonly make an illegal shortcut through campus
to avoid a red light.

DiFava said he'd pulled his car next to Collier's to see how he was doing.

'Just making sure everybody behaves,' Collier replied.

The two men talked for a few minutes before DiFava pulled away.

Half an hour after the DiFava got home, the deputy chief called him.

Collier was appointed to the Somerville Police Department posthumously to honor his sacrifice

'He said Sean Collier has been shot,' the DiFava remembered.

'From the time I saw him to the time he was dead, it was probably about an hour.'

Since then, law enforcement has called what happened to Collier an assassination.

Surveillance camera video shows the two suspects creeping up on Collier's squad car from behind.

He was shot five time, police said. Two of those rounds were to the head.

'He didn't stand a chance,' DiFava said.

The suspects allegedly tried to take Collier's gun but were unable to unlock it.

'The retention holster does its job well, so perhaps they didn’t get 
the gun because of that holster,’' DiFava said. 'Maybe that’s 
what thwarted them from getting the gun, because the gun was not removed
from the holster.'

It's still uncertain why the Tsarnaevs were at MIT or what attracted them to Collier.

'We have all kinds of unanswered questions,' DiFava said.

Collier was laid to rest on Tuesday at

'Our only solace is that Sean died 
bravely doing what he committed his life to - serving and protecting 
others,' his family said in a statement.

He was a Wilmington native and a graduate of Salem State University. He is survived by his parents and five siblings.

The young officer enjoyed climbing mountains, training young boxers and playing kickball on a team 
called Kickhopopotamus - but most of all, he was dedicated to being a police officer.

Officer
Collier impressed students and his colleagues with his contagious 
enthusiasm, be it offering students rides or volunteering for extra 
duties.

DiFava 
said on days before the service: 'Just the other day - and I still have 
it on my computer -  he asked me if I would have a problem if he 
approached the homeless shelter to see if he could become a member of 
the board of directors, so that he could work with those people down 
there and try to mitigate problems before the problems develop.

Chief DiFava added: 'The kid was the real deal.'
