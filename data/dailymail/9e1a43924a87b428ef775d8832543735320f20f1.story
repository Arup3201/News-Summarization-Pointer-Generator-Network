Stuart Broad celebrated England's 3-1 series victory against India by bowling another maiden over - sharing a drink with his girlfriend Bealey Mitchell on The Kia Oval outfield.

The seam bowler was part of an England side that beat India by an innings and 244 runs in south London and Broad - who was in buoyant mood after the win - shared a kiss with his model girlfriend.

It was different to the way they last celebrated a series victory at The Oval - after winning the Ashes in 2013 some England players urinated on the pitch.

But all that was flowing this time was praise and Broad felt his team were fully deserving of their three-day victory.

'We knew if we did similar to the first innings and got the ball full enough to encourage the drive, we'd have results,' he told Sky Sports.

'Obviously we didn't dream we'd get 10 wickets as quickly as that, but we deserved it. We put a lot of hard work in all summer.'

Broad was essential to England's victory effort throughout the series and formed a formidable new-ball partnership with James Anderson.

He also batted bravely at The Kia Oval, just a week after being hit in the face by a Varun Aaron bouncer, dealing with a barrage of short stuff.
