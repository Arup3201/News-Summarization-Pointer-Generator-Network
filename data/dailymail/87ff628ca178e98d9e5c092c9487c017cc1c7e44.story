David Cameron has told EU chief Jose Manuel Barroso that the British people want migration from Europe ‘fixed’ – and he promised detailed proposals by Christmas on how he will do it.

The Prime Minister hit back at Mr Barroso, who declared on a visit to London that curbs on migrants from the Continent would be ‘illegal’ and Britain would be left with not even ‘marginal influence’ in the world if it left the EU.

Mr Cameron said British voters – not the head of the European Commission – were ‘the boss’, insisting reform of the right to free movement would be central to demands for a looser relationship with Brussels if he wins the next election.

Strong words: David Cameron hit back at Jose Manuel Barroso (left), saying the voters were his 'boss'

Senior Tories believe he will wait until after the Rochester by-election at the end of next month to set out his plans.

The Daily Mail revealed last month that Cabinet ministers are examining the idea of an ‘emergency brake’ which could be applied to limit numbers if migration exceeded forecasts.

Yesterday there were claims ministers also want to draw on current practice in Croatia, the latest country to join the EU.

British workers wanting to live and work there for more than three months need a work permit, only issued with proof of accommodation, financial means of support, health insurance and a criminal background check.

Mr Cameron said: ‘What we need in Britain is a renegotiation of our relationship with the European Union and a referendum where the British people decide whether to stay in this reformed organisation or do we leave it.

‘Now that’s what I will pursue, that’s what I will deliver and at the heart of that renegotiation we need to address people’s concerns about immigration.

'I’m very clear about who the boss is, about who I answer to and it is the British people. They want this, they’re not being unreasonable about it. I will fix it.’

But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg claimed Mr Barroso was right to warn that Britain would be marginalised on the world stage if it quits the EU. 

He said: ‘Just ask yourself this – do you really think that people in Beijing, Washington, Tokyo are going to take Britain seriously in the future if we don’t stand tall in Brussels, Berlin and Paris?

Ed Miliband has appointed one of Labour’s few remaining Blairite MPs as shadow Europe minister.

In a mini reshuffle prompted by the resignation of Rushanara Ali over Labour’s support for airstrikes in Iraq, former business minister Pat McFadden was promoted.

He is an arch-supporter of Tony Blair and is likely to sharpen Labour’s position on EU reform.  

‘I just think bobbing around rather hopelessly in the mid-Atlantic, and having lots of major foreign investors pulling out of this country jeopardising millions of jobs…I don’t think is a way of making this country stronger and safer and more prosperous in the future.’

Mr Barroso, who steps down from his post at the end of the month, warned Britain would struggle to have even ‘marginal influence’ in the world outside the EU.

It came as France unveiled proposed legislation which could mean EU migrants being refused entry if their ‘personal behaviour’ is considered a threat to ‘security or public order’.

Will the options work? Analysis by JAMES SLACK

David Cameron’s immigration proposals are on hold until December. Home Affairs Editor JAMES SLACK looks at his options and whether they will work.

AN 'EMERGENCY BRAKE' 

Controls would be imposed on EU migrants if the number of new arrivals have a ‘destabilising’ effect on the economy or public services. The measure would be strictly temporary – leaving Mr Cameron open to criticism he has not regained control of Britain’s borders.

Achievable? Not impossible. There are precedents for short-term suspensions of free movement. The Open Europe think-tank says member states with high levels of immigration could support Mr Cameron to help him secure a Yes vote in an EU referendum.

QUOTAS OR A LIMIT ON NI NUMBERS 

Only a fixed number of EU nationals allowed in each year. One method would see a time limit placed on NI numbers – preventing people from working or claiming benefits indefinitely. This could prove a bureaucratic nightmare and it is unclear how the Home Office would be able to remove those without permission to be here.

Achievable? Almost certainly not. It is illegal under existing treaties and other states would be highly unlikely to negotiate, having voted against a Swiss quota plan. Mr Cameron would have to threaten to leave the EU and hope countries such as Poland preferred some of its countrymen being guaranteed entry, rather than none if Britain quit.

A POINTS SYSTEM 

EU workers would only be allowed in if their skills are needed. To appease Brussels, the threshold could be set lower for EU nationals than non-EU worker.

Achievable? No. It would involve ripping up treaties and there is no appetite to even consider the idea among EU members.

BENEFITS RESTRICTIONS 

Mr Cameron has already tightened access to unemployment benefits. He could augment this with controls on benefits which top-up wages. This would reduce a major pull factor for families from countries such as Romania and Bulgaria, where wages are low.

Achievable? Yes. Many member states share Britain’s concerns and would like to re-take control of their own benefit systems.

MAKE A STAND AND DEFY BRUSSELS 

Unilaterally re-impose border controls on EU nationals without bothering to first renegotiate the existing treaties.

Achievable? Yes – if the political will exists. Britain would be hauled to the European Court of Justice but some Tories believe that, prior to an election, this could be hugely popular.

QUIT THE EU 

The Ukip position is that nothing short of full withdrawal will give back border control.

Achievable? Yes, though it would require the support of the public in a referendum. Mr Cameron’s critics say that, unless he at least threatens to leave, he should expect to achieve nothing in negotiations.
