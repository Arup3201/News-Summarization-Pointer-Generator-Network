A high school's new principal - who was named Principal of the Year in his former job - has resigned after being involved in two drunk-driving crashes in one night.

Just two weeks before he was due to start at Milton High School in Milton, Georgia, 37-year-old Nathan Buhl was captured looking battered and bruised in two mug shots from different counties.

He was arrested twice on charges including hit and run, DUI, reckless driving and failure to report striking an object following the crashes on Saturday night - and after three nights in two different jails, he resigned from his new job on Wednesday.

On Saturday, he had left a home in north Forsyth County about 9.42pm when he allegedly hit a parked car with his own car. The owner saw the accident and called deputies with the tag number.

Busted: Two mug shots from two different Georgia counties show Nathan Buhl after he was arrested for DUI crashes on Saturday night. The high school principal said he could not remember the accidents

When deputies in Forsyth ran the plate, they learned it was from Cherokee County and when they called the sheriff's office, an investigator confirmed there had been another wreck with the same vehicle, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

Authorities had found Buhl's 
car off the road and lying on the driver's side door between two trees. A tire was missing and there were car parts 
and debris strewn all over two lawns, CBS46 reported.

Firefighters cut away the windshield to pull a bruised Buhl out of his smashed Chrysler 200. He miraculously only suffered cuts and bruises.

Glen Edseth, whose parked car was hit in Forsyth County in the first wreck, said he 
ran outside Edseth when he heard the collision and saw Buhl driving erratically through his 
neighborhood.

Respected: Buhl had been named Principal of the Year and was 2 weeks away from a new role

'I suppose he probably didn't have any idea what he
 was doing,' Edseth said.

Deputies from both Forsyth County and Cherokee County caught up with Buhl when he was taken to hospital for treatment and he was arrested on Sunday when he was released.

Authorities said Buhl admitted to drinking before getting behind the wheel but he was not sure how many drinks he had had - and could not recall the two accidents.

A breathalyzer test showed his blood alcohol level was 0.193. The legal limit for Georgia is 0.08.

He was booked into the Forsyth County jail, where he 
was later released after posting $8,525 bond. There he was charged with DUI, hit and run, failure to report striking an object and failure to maintain lane.

After being released, he then surrendered to the Cherokee County jail. He was released from this second jail on Tuesday after posting $3,551 bond. In Cherokee, he was charged with DUI, reckless driving, weaving and operating an unsafe vehicle.

He resigned and sent an apologetic email to colleagues and parents on Wednesday.

'I am humbled and ashamed after making the worst decisions of my life Saturday night,' he wrote. 'A night of celebration quickly turned to nightmare because of the series of poor choices that I made.'

He wrote that he had to reflect on what had led him to make the bad decision and said he was aware he could have killed someone.

Resignation: After spending three nights in jail, Buhl stepped down from the new role at Milton High School in Fulton, Georgia. He said he was 'humbled and ashamed' by his bad choices

He added: 'Teenagers wrestle with the same kind of 
choices I faced Saturday night on a regular basis. How can I stand 
before them and tell them to do what I say, not what I did?'

The Fulton County Schools superintendent said he was 'disappointed' to hear about the charges.

'But [I] believe he has done 
the right thing by stepping down as principal,' Superintendent Robert 
Avossa said. 'He is taking full responsibility 
for his actions and their consequences, and this sends the right message
 to the students and community we serve.'

Buhl, who is married, was named principal at Milton High School in April and he was due to take over at the start of the term in two weeks. An interim principal has been assigned until a new one can be found.

He had previously served as the principal of Crabapple Middle School, where he was named the 2013-2014 Principal of the Year by the North Fulton PTA Council, NorthFulton.com reported.
