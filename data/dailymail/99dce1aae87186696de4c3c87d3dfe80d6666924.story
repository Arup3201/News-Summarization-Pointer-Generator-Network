Lord Tebbit today warned disabled people could be put under pressure to ‘do the right thing’ and end their lives if the law is changed to allow the right to die.

In a moving speech, the former Tory chairman revealed his wife – paralysed by the Brighton Bomb – had once told him ‘you’d be better off without me’.

He said the comment illustrated the way in which a change to the law would put countless people under pressure to end their lives for the sake of their families.

Lord Tebbit said his wife Margaret had been in constant pain for the last 30 years, since she was injured in the 1984 IRA Brighton bombing, and the pain was getting worse

He made his comments as peers debate a controversial private member’s bill put forward by Lord Falconer, the former Lord Chancellor to give some terminally-ill patients the right to die.

The proposed legislation would allow doctors to prescribe a lethal dose to terminally-ill patients judged to have six months or less to live who request it.

It was given an unopposed second reading in July after a marathon 10-hour debate featuring nearly 130 speeches both for and against the move.

Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, was one of those voting in favour – even though he has previously opposed the move.

In a debate today, Lord Tebbit said there needed to be changes so that there was some ‘deterrence against wrongdoing’ – to stop people putting pressure on people to end their lives.

‘Supposing there is wrongdoing, how do we deter it? At the moment, if somebody wrongfully puts pressure on, or wrongfully assists, a suicide, they know that the law is there and that its hand may fall on their shoulder.

‘I may be wrong but, as I see it, if we enacted these measures we would only be adding to the procedures, not to the deterrents against wrongdoing.’

He said his wife Margaret had been in constant pain for the last 30 years, since she was injured in the 1984 IRA Brighton bombing, and the pain was getting worse.

‘I fear for the day when she will say again to me what she said to me a little while ago: “You know, you would be better off without me”.

‘There are many ways in which pressure can be brought to bear to make people who are perhaps approaching the end of their lives—although I hope that my wife is not—to “do the decent thing”.

‘These amendments do not do anything to avoid that, and that is what worries me.’

Lord Tebbit said that unless there was deterrence, some people would do wrong – something he said had happened with abortion because doctors who pre-sign forms are never punished although it is against the law.

‘A number of doctors, quite wrongfully, signed chits, or whatever they are called, to allow sex-selective and frequently late abortion of patients whom they had never seen and whose names they did not know, have gone unpunished,’ he said. ‘Where is the deterrence to that?’

Peers were given extra time to make progress on a controversial backbench Bill giving some terminally-ill patients the right to die.

Some 170 amendments to the legislation had been lain down. With only limited parliamentary time available for private members' legislation, supporters fear the amendments could scupper its chances.

Opinion outside Parliament is sharply divided, with disability campaigners voicing concern today about the attempt to change the law on assisted dying, while supporters of change claimed opponents were determined to ‘strangle’ the legislation.

Labour's Lord Campbell-Savours said there were people who 'desperately want out'.

Despite being ill for 31 years, such a course of action had not crossed his mind. 'But one day it may cross my mind and I want that right - and I don't want the courts to interfere in it,’ he said.

Fertility expert and Labour peer Lord Winston said that with increasing numbers of distressed elderly people in hospital, it was vital to have the safeguards in Lord Pannick's amendment to protect society.

'It is essential we have some kind of legal process which ensures that this Bill is properly policed,' he said.

'It cannot be left to the medical and nursing profession to make their minds up.'

Justice minister Lord Faulks said the issue was for Parliament to decide. The Government was taking a 'neutral' position and would allow a free vote if any of the amendments was pressed to a division.

Lord Falconer said he agreed that the decision should not be left to doctors alone and that there was a place for judges to provide confidence in the proposed system.

'In principle, I think although it may deter some people, ultimately it will give greater protection,' he said. 'I accept ... there needs to be some degree of judicial oversight.'

Peers backed an amendment adding judicial safeguards to the legislation.

Under the change a High Court judge of the family division would have to be satisfied that the person seeking the right to die had a 'voluntary, clear, settled and informed wish to end' their life.
