It had no catchphrases, no music and not even footage of a supermarket - but Aldi's ad campaign has been named the most memorable of 2014.

The clips of customers comparing the price of cheese and tea with better-known brands were recalled more often than Iceland's or Morrisons', despite the rivals hiring Peter Andre and Ant and Dec.

It is another coup for the discount brand, which has  beaten more upmarket rivals like Tesco and Sainsbury's to sales targets and industry awards amid the rise of the thrifty weekly shop.

Spot the difference: Aldi's comparison adverts have helped it become the most memorable brand of last year

Simple: The format features customers comparing two products which they claim taste identical

Aldi's adverts came top of a study by Marketing magazine, which compiles a list every week of how well various firms' ad campaigns are being remembered.

The magazine found Aldi's brand was the most consistently well-recalled throughout 2014 as a whole, with an aggregate score of 169 points.

It was followed in the supermarket stakes by Morrisons (92 points), Iceland (81 points), Asda (59 points) and Tesco (57 points).

The scores were compiled by awarding a brand ten points if it came first in a weekly ranking, nine points if it came second, and so on. Aldi's score meant it hovered on average around seventh place across the year.

Aldi won despite its adverts being banned twice last year by the Advertising Standards Authority following complaints by rival supermarket chains.

Fame: Jean Jones, 83, from Middlesborough, kicked off the trend in 2011 by appearing in this tea advert

The most recent ASA decision on December 31 came after Tesco complained an Aldi comparisons misled viewers by being out of date and not relevant to a 'price-sensitive market'.

In that case, the ASA banned the advert despite admitting Aldi offered savings because the chain exaggerated how many people had taken part in a brand-swap 'challenge'.

The adverts said 84 out of 98 people saved at Aldi compared to Tesco, but only four of those involved had taken part over the full eight weeks stated.

Despite this the adverts have warmed the public's hearts since 2011, when one of their first stars became an online sensation.

Jean Jones, 83, from Middlesborough, landed the acting job on a whim and said it was her first since she was in a Shakespeare play at the age of 14.

'I buy this tea for my husband,' she told the camera. 'He likes tea. He also likes this one. I don’t like tea. I like gin.'

Last year's versions included a woman in a red dress enjoying an ice cream, a hapless fisherman and his daughter with fish fingers and a bearded man eating cheese.

No comparison: Iceland's adverts featuring Peter Andre made it to sixth place in the overall list

Festive: Iceland was the second-placed supermarket, with budget brands all jostling for the top spot

The budget German chain was named Grocer of the Year last June for the second time in a row, beating its upmarket rivals to the 'Oscar' of the supermarket world.

It wasn't all ordinary people, though - the adverts also include former England manager Graham Taylor drinking Aldi-brand cider and tipping himself back in an armchair.

And for its Christmas advert, the firm departed from the usual format and featured BBC presenter and musician Jools Holland.

In the overall rankings by Marketing magazine, the famously repetitive and functional DFS sofa adverts came second, while promotional clips for Argos came third.

Adverts did not have to be well-liked. Compare the Market and GoCompare, with their meerkats and opera singers, both came in the top ten.

Morag Blazey, chief executive of advert analysts Ebiquity UK said: 'We recognise the formula but we are not tired of it; we watch because we know it will be amusing and engaging.

'Other supermarket brands spend more but have a less consistent message.' 

Third place: Ant and Dec appeared in several adverts for the supermarket chain Morrisons last year
