As Manchester United bowled over Newcastle 3-1 on Boxing Day, defender Marcos Rojo showed off his tenpin skills during a family day out.

The 24-year-old was all smiles as he uploaded a photo to his Instagram account at a bowling alley which included girlfriend Eugenia Lusardo.

Accompanied with the caption 'Quien estara ganando ?' which translates to 'Who will win?', the Argentina international showed his competitive instinct occurs even off-the-pitch with close ones.

Rojo has missed United's last three Premier League games after sustaining a thigh injury during training ahead of their 3-0 win against Liverpool on December 14.

The former Sporting Lisbon star, who joined from the Portuguese giants in a £16million deal this summer, has endured an injury-troubled start to his United career.

He has made 10 appearances for the club this season, during which he has suffered a dislocated shoulder away at Manchester City. But despite his indifferent start at Old Trafford Rojo says he has loved every minute at the Theatre of Dreams.

'It's all going well,' Rojo said  in the Boxing Day edition of United Review, the club's official matchday programme. 'I've settled in really quickly and I like the city a lot. The football club is incredible.

'I get on really well with my team-mates and they treat me well.

'And, what's more, it's even better now we are on a run of winning almost every game.'

There's no specific return to Rojo's return date to Louis van Gaal's first-team picture but the United boss revealed after their Boxing Day encounter that he is nearing full fitness.
