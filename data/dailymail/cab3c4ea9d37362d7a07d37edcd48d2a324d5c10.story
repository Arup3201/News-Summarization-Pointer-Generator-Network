Pakistan off-spinner Saeed Ajmal is confident of having his bowling action cleared by the International Cricket Council after undergoing an official test.

Ajmal was put through his paces at an ICC accredited bio-mechanics centre in Chennai in India on Saturday, having already taken part in a 'private test' in a laboratory in Edgbaston in mid-January.

Ajmal had ruled himself out of Pakistan's World Cup plans - his place seemingly going to inexperienced leg-spinner Yasir Shah.

Worcestershire bowler Ajmal was suspended last year after his bowling action was deemed illegal

'I felt those who tested me were happy with my action,' Ajmal told Indian newspaper, The Hindu. 'I am hopeful, but ultimately the decision rests with them.

'I bowled 30 deliveries. And I bowled five different kinds of balls six times each. I bowled the doosra, the carrom ball, the off-spinner, (the) seam-up and the quicker one.

'If I had just wanted to bowl the off-spinner, I could have got my action cleared in two weeks. But I want to retain my variety. I think my doosra is within permissible limits now.

'If they are not happy with my doosra, then I feel I can still bowl effectively with my off-spinner and other deliveries.'

He claims he wants to be the number one bowler in the side and would rather retire than make up the numbers

Worcestershire spinner Ajmal was suspended from bowling for an illegal action last year after being reported during a Test against Sri Lanka.

Following months of rehabilitation work, including under former Pakistan spinner Saqlain Mushtaq, Ajmal appears keen to make up for lost time.

'I want to be a frontline bowler, the number one bowler in the side,' he said. 'I don't want to make up numbers. I would rather retire than do that.

'Saqlain Bhai (brother) told me there was no use being depressed. He inspired me to pick myself up. I have bowled around 12,000 deliveries with my new action in the last four months.'
