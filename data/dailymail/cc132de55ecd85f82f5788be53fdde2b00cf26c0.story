House Speaker John Boehner refused on Thursday to rule out a government shutdown as a means to block President Barack Obama from halting deportations for millions of illegal immigrants.

'All options are on the table,' Boehner said during a press conference this afternoon, noting that Republicans in the House are still discussing their next move and have not made any definite decisions yet.

'Our goal here is to stop the president from violating his own oath of office and violating the Constitution. It's not to shut down the government,' he said when a reporter asked him to clarify the GOP's intentions. 

As Boehner walked away another reporter tried to get him to state on the record that he would not allow a government shut down, but the GOP leader did not respond. 

Today Fox News reported that Obama would implement a 10-point plan to change the immigration system as early as next Friday, leading to a renewed effort among House Republicans to use an upcoming spending debate to force Obama's hand.

Speaker of the House John Boehner refused to rule out a government shutdown today, telling reporters that 'all options are on the table' to stop President Barack Obama's forthcoming plans to halt deportations of millions of illegal immigrants

President Obama, pictured here speaking with staff before a speech today at the Association of South East Asian Nations-United States Summit in Myanmar, will reportedly announce his immigration plans as early as next Friday

Fox said Thursday that a source close to the White House confirmed that Obama is looking to expand his deferred action program that allows children of illegal immigrants to stay in the U.S. indefinitely to include any one who came to the U.S. as a child.

The sweeping order would also allow parents of both citizen children and illegal immigrant children to remain in the U.S.That portion of the directive alone could save as many as 4.5 million immigrants with U.S. born children from being removed from the country, Fox estimated.

The section extending the president's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals could protect another 300,000. 

Instead of requiring that illegal immigrants applying for residency under the provision be under the age of 31 and provide proof that they arrived her before July of 2007, anyone who came to the country before January 1, 2010, when they were under the age of 16 would be eligible for DACA.

A half-million immigrants and their spouses could apply for citizenship through a State Department visa program for high-tech jobs. 

Not all 10 sections of the president's plan would give cover to categories of illegal immigrants. One would give Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers a raise to 'increase morale,' Fox said.

Another would authorize the Department of Homeland Security to 'promote' naturalization by giving a 50 percent discount to the first 10,000 applicants, excluding illegal immigrants whose incomes are 200 percent above the federal poverty level.

The president will likely direct ICE to focus on deporting criminals over other illegals, as well.

Obama was reportedly briefed on a draft of the plans on his way to Asia. The White House has yet to give its final seal of approval, however, the source told Fox News.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest today told reporters traveling with the president in Asia that Obama still hasn't made up his mind and would not make an announcement on immigration until after he returns to Washington, D.C. this weekend.

Earnest said Obama is 'nearing a final decision,' however.

If the timing laid out it the draft proposal is accurate, executive action would come weeks sooner than anticipated. While the president has said he would act before the end of the year, no directive was expected to come before lawmakers had passed legislation extending funding for the government.

The current resolution expires Dec. 11, the day before the House is scheduled to recess until the end of the current Congress.

Interference by Obama will most assuredly provoke conservative legislators in the House and Senate who are already itching to use the spending debate  to tie Obama's hands on immigration.

While Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has promised there will not be another government shut down, that doesn't mean that anti-amnesty zealots in his caucus, who have said they will use all procedural means available to stop Obama, won't give it another try.

Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, who will likely ascend to chairman of the budget committee when Republicans become the majority party next year, has said he wants to use the budget process to bar spending on any immigration reforms ordered up by Obama without the consent of Congress.

The Hill reported this morning that Sessions' strategy now has the backing of 50 members of the House, making it impossible for Republican leadership in both chambers to ignore.

Conservatives in the House, led by Arizona Rep. Rep. Matt Salmon, sent a letter today to House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers and ranking member Nita Lowey asking them to include language in the budget 'to prohibit the use of funds by the administration for the implementation of current or future executive actions that would create additional work permits outside of the scope prescribed by Congress.'

Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts also said in a statement today that he would support Sessions.

'I stand ready to do whatever it takes to stop amnesty by executive action or by any other means,' he said.

Meanwhile, Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn said she would reintroduce legislation at the top of the new legislative session 'to freeze DACA' and ban the president from using executive orders to create similar programs in the future.

'This election was a referendum on the Obama doctrine of lawlessness that is cracking the foundation of our democracy and shredding the Constitution,' the GOP lawmaker said in an op-ed for Breitbart News. 

'The American people want it stopped, period.'

Both McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner publicly warned Obama last week that he would 'poison the well' with Republicans by acting alone on immigration, but the Democratic president has not heeded their advice.  

In a press conference the day after the midterm elections and in an interview with CBS a few days later he said recommitted to issuing an executive order on immigration before the end of the calendar year. 

In a closed-door meeting with Republicans today, Boehner reportedly told his members that he told the president point blank last Friday that, ' "If you proceed with executive amnesty, not only can you forget about getting immigration reform enacted during your presidency, you can also expect it to jeopardize other issues as well." ' 

'We don’t know when exactly he’ll do it or how exactly he’ll do it. But if he proceeds, we are going to fight it,' Boehner promised, according to a source in the room who spoke to Politico.

At today's press conference Boehner was asked in no uncertain terms if the GOP would consider using the budget process to take a stand against Obama's planned actions, and Boehner repeatedly said that 'all options are on the table.'

'I'll just say this, we're going to fight the president tooth and nail if he continues down this path,' Boehner told reporters.

'This is the wrong way to govern,' he added. 'This is exactly what the American people said on election day they didn't want.'

Earlier today at his own presser McConnell had said that there would absolutely be no government shutdown or threatening by Senate Republicans to default on the national debt if Obama disobeys, however, potentially putting him at odds with his counterpart in the House.

Obama is reportedly planning to allow illegal immigrants who came here as children and their parents to live and work in the U.S. indefinitely

Sen. Orrin Hatch, a former Judiciary Committee chairman, joined in last night on calls for Obama to hold his fire, writing in Politico Magazine that 'the president’s promise to act unilaterally in other areas will only short-circuit the statutory reforms we desperately need.' 

'There is a viable path to meaningful immigration reform, but it does not begin with executive amnesty,' he said.

Hatch pointed out that he is not against the comprehensive immigration reform measures backed by the president, and he in fact voted for them when they came before the Senate. Rather, he is against the 'increasingly broad carve-outs to the enforcement of our current immigration laws' that Obama is considering. 

Arguing that Obama is 'bowing to pressure from his base, and perhaps because of his own impatience,' Hatch said his the president's 'promise to make further unilateral changes to our nation’s immigration policy breeds mistrust and makes meaningful legislative reform even harder to achieve.'

Progressives within the Democratic caucus have been pressuring Obama to broaden his 2012 immigration order for months, and upon their return to Washington after the most recent recess, they again took up the mantle.

'We're begging the president. Go big. These [illegal immigrants] are a plus to our nation. Mr. President, please. You said you were going to do something. Do it. Act now,' Rep. Juan Vargas of California said Wednesday. 

In an interview this morning on MSNBC Illinois Rep. Luis Gutierrez said the president needs to act in a 'bold' and 'generous' manner before the holiday season.

'I've always said that the blessings of Thanksgiving should be bountiful this year for millions of immigrants that have been waiting for the Congress to act,' Gutierrez told Morning Joe co-host Joe Scarborough.

Gutierrez said it was Republicans who have proved the untrustworthy partner in immigration reform.

'Every time we set the menu, every time we set the table, they walked away,' he said. 'And they keep talking about this poison well. They kind of doubled down on poisoning the well.'

Republicans 'really poisoned that well' during the midterm elections by claiming that Mexican immigrants were coming to take American jobs, Ebola could become an epidemic in the U.S. and ISIS could attack America.

Still, Gutierrez said, he's ready to work with Republicans to pass immigration reform if they're willing to work with him. 

'And we still have time to do it,' he said.
