The missing seven-year-old whose mother ran away with him to stop him having cancer treatment has been temporarily put in foster care.

Neon Roberts, who disappeared from Tiverton in Devon on Monday, is now being given emergency treatment, after a frantic nationwide search for him was mounted over the past four days.

His mother Sally, 37, had taken her son to Sussex, more than 160 miles away, because she only wanted him to be given ‘natural remedies’ as he recovers from 
surgery on a brain tumour.

A judge yesterday revealed Neon's identity following concerns that he might not survive if he was not given treatment immediately.

A statement released by Devon and 
Cornwall Police at 2.30am said: 'Following extensive Press coverage on 5th and 6th December 2012, the high risk missing person, 
seven-year-old Neon Roberts, has been located by police officers in 
Sussex.

'He is currently in foster care and Neon’s welfare will be considered in the High Court tomorrow.

'Devon and Cornwall Police would like
 to thank the public, the media and police colleagues in Sussex for 
their assistance in securing Neon’s safe recovery.'

The ‘very sick’ boy’s doctors had said his chances of surviving would be ‘dramatically reduced’ if he did  not 
begin radiotherapy soon, and his father was desperate to make sure his 
son had ‘everything available’ to help him fight the disease.

Life or death: High Court judge Mrs Justice Hogg was so concerned for the boy's welfare she relaxed reporting restrictions to reveal his identity

Mrs Roberts and her estranged husband 
Ben, Neon’s father, are currently at the centre of a court battle over 
the boy’s treatment for his brain cancer.

In an extremely rare move, a judge 
sitting at the High Court yesterday ruling that reporting 
restrictions on the case should be relaxed so that Neon could be 
identified, to improve the chances of finding him.

The judge said she was ‘deeply 
concerned’ about the child’s welfare. 

Mrs Roberts, originally from New 
Zealand and a keen believer in homeopathic medicine, had been staying in
 the West Country with family after Neon underwent brain surgery there.

Mr Roberts, 34, raised the alarm this week after not hearing from his son since the weekend.

Lawyers for the NHS and Devon County 
Council, who are tasked with looking after the boy’s interests, 
yesterday agreed his disappearance should be made public and went to the
 High Court to lift reporting restrictions.

Mr Roberts, an IT consultant from 
Knightsbridge, west London, said outside court that his wife  was 
opposed to the radiation  treatment, fearing that it might damage their 
son’s ‘intelligence, growth and hormones’.

He said: ‘She wants to do everything 
she can and rely on natural remedies and things that are not too 
invasive, rather than radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

‘She is worried about the damage that can be done. She wants him to be able to live a normal life.

‘Personally, I want everything for 
him. I want to make sure  he has everything available to him. I 
understand there are lots of things that can be done to minimise the 
after effects of radiotherapy, with various other pre- and 
post-treatments.

‘All the evidence I have been 
presented with has told me he needs to have that therapy, but I am also 
aware there are side effects. It concerns me as well.’

Making the ruling, Mrs Justice Hogg 
said: ‘I have made an order permitting the identification of the child, 
Neon Luca Roberts, who is aged seven. It’s thought that he is need of 
urgent life-saving hospital treatment.

‘He suffers from a brain tumour and 
has recently had surgery and the doctors responsible for his treatment 
believe he urgently needs radiotherapy.

‘His mother, Mrs Sally Roberts, who is
 also known as Sally Lees, is opposed to the treatment and has 
disappeared with Neon. She was last seen in Devon on Sunday.

‘Her family have had no contact with her for several days and are very concerned for her and Neon.

‘The doctors say that, unless 
treatment is started next week, the prospects of Neon surviving are 
dramatically reduced. I have asked for the assistance of the public in 
looking for this very sick little boy.

‘I have also made urgent arrangements 
for a hearing to consider the case and future treatment on Friday of 
this week by a judge of the Family Division of the High Court.

‘I hope very much that Mrs Roberts will make contact with  her solicitors and the court as soon as possible.

‘As I say, there is an urgent hearing 
fixed for Friday this week, where she will be able to put her case 
before any decision about treatment is given.

‘I can only urge her to come forward. I am deeply concerned for the welfare and wellbeing of this little boy.’

The NHS and local authorities have the
 right to take legal action when parents are opposed to treatment that 
doctors deem necessary to save their child’s life. To protect the 
child’s privacy, the identities of the families involved in such cases 
are rarely revealed.

Mrs Roberts is well-known in music 
circles, and has performed as DJ Sally at events and venues ranging from
 Glastonbury Festival to Boujis Nightclub in London.

Permanent side effects from radiotherapy are more common in children, as their nervous systems are still developing and more likely to be harmed by radiation.

Physical problems following treatment for a brain tumour may include limb weakness, poor balance and uncontrollable shaking.

According to a National Cancer Institute survey, a quarter of children have fits or blackouts after the type of radiotherapy that Neon would undergo, and a third have headaches or migraines.

A small number will also be left with hearing difficulties, while some may lose their sight.

There is also a risk of mental side effects. Some children may have difficulties with learning and problem solving, and suffer from poor short-term memory.

Others may find that their brain tumour symptoms even get worse after beginning radiotherapy treatment. This is because it causes a temporary swelling in the area that is being treated, which can lead to headaches, nausea and fits.

In the short-term, the treatment can also cause tiredness and  hair loss on the area of the head being treated.

Delayed side effects, which might not appear for some months, include a loss of appetite, a lack of energy and worsening of old symptoms. This is because the radiation kills tumour cells but also damages some healthy cells, according to Cancer Research UK. 

Some patients may not experience adverse effects until years after their treatment. These problems, which can be permanent, include difficulty thinking clearly, poor memory, confusion and personality changes.
