Victoria Beckham has just celebrated her landmark 40th birthday and looks better than ever.

So how does one half of the world's most powerful A-list couples, mother to four young children and head of a burgeoning fashion empire stay healthy?

The former Spice Girl has finally shared her secret - and it's bound to cause a buzz.

What's her secret? Victoria Beckham has just hit her 40th birthday and has revealed her favourite new health superfood as bee pollen

A prolific tweeter, the former popstar tweeted her love of her favourite healthy food supplement: bee pollen.

While the majority of us were devouring our leftover Easter eggs on Bank Holiday Monday, Victoria tweeted to her 7.46m followers: 'Totally obsessed with this Bee pollen! so good for u!! X vb'.

Bee pollen, which is made by honeybees and priced at around £3.50 for 50g, is usually taken in granule form and you can sprinkle it onto salads or smoothies.

It is widely considered one of nature's most complete nourishing superfoods because it contains nearly all of the nutrients required to function by humans, including amino acids, B-complex, and folic acid.

New obsession: Victoria, who last weekend celebrated her 40th birthday, tweeted about her love for bee pollen, which she described as being 'so good for you'

It is said that bee pollen boosts energy levels, can be used topically to soothe skin conditions, curbs cravings and even acts as an aphrodisiac.

What does it do? Bee pollen, which can be sprinkled onto salad or into smoothies, is said to boost energy levels, curb cravings and act as an aphrodisiac

Katy Mason, Nutritionist at NutriCentre.com, said: 'Bee pollen is the pollen collected by bees from flowers; if you look closely at bees in the summer you may see little yellow balls collected on their legs, this is bee pollen which the bee is gathering to take back to the hive.

'These little pellets of bee pollen can then be harvested by bee keepers from the hive and taken to supplement the diet.

'Bee pollen is known for its rich and varied nutritional properties, it is high in proteins, amino acids, vitamins and folic acid.

'It is unique in that it is high in nutrients other products of animal origin don't possess. For example, bee pollen contains more amino acids gram for gram than beef, eggs or cheese.

'It can help increase energy due to the high B vitamin content and includes large amounts of rutin, an antioxidant that helps strengthen capillaries and blood vessels, which can support the cardiovascular system. 

'Bee
 pollen contains all the nutrients we need; it is a wonderful vegetarian
 source of protein and contains all of the B vitamins, including vitamin
 B12 which can be hard to find in vegetarian sources.'

Susan 
Curtis, Natural Health Director of Neal’s Yard Remedies, adds: 'Bee 
pollen is one of nature's most completely nourishing foods, with nearly 
all the nutrients required by humans.

'It has been used for energy and endurance since ancient
 times, with a single pellet containing over 2 million nutrient-packed 
flower pollen granule.'

Looking good: Clearly the bee pollen is working wonders; Victoria arrived back from LA after her birthday celebrations looking younger than ever

1. Energy booster: Full of carbohydrates, protein (50 per cent) and B vitamins, it enhances stamina and fights off fatigue

2. Soothing: It can be used topically to treat psoriasis or 
eczema

3. Immune system booster: According to holistic health expert 
Dr. Joseph Mercola, bee pollen has antibiotic-type properties, which apparently protect the body from contracting viruses

4. Addiction treatment: Has been used holistically for years to help heal addictions and curb cravings by suppressing impulses

5. Infertility problems: Bee pollen may help women get pregnant because it stimulates and restores ovarian 
function, is a hormonal booster and an aphrodisiac

How much should you take? Katy Mason explains: 'Bee pollen can be made up of up to 40 per cent protein so one teaspoon of bee pollen (5g) would contain about 2g of 
protein.

'An average protein requirement would be around 60g a day so 
although bee pollen will only contribute slightly to that amount, it is 
the quality of the protein in bee pollen that is so beneficial.

'What 
that means is that it contains many of the different types of amino 
acids that make up protein; this is great because the body needs 
different amino acids as building blocks in the body.

'Bee pollen can
 be taken off the spoon, added to smoothies or sprinkled on food and can
 be a great way to increase the nutrients in your diet.'
