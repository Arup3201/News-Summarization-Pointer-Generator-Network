Roy Hodgson made a mistake by revealing Raheem Sterling told him he was feeling tired ahead of England’s game against Estonia, according to former England and Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy.

Sterling has come under fire after he was left on the bench for England’s Euro 2016 qualifier in Estonia.

The 19-year-old was replaced by Liverpool team-mate Adam Lallana in the staring XI, but he came on in the second half and played his part in England’s winning goal by winning the free kick from which Wayne Rooney scored.

But Murphy believes Hodgson would have been better to keep the conversation between him and Sterling to himself.

'I think Roy will regret putting it out there,’ Murphy said on talkSPORT. 'I think he [Hodgson] could have just maybe taken it on the chin and said, ‘I thought I’d give him a little breather', rather than put it on the lad.

'He wouldn’t have intentionally put it on him to create this, but I think Roy could have dealt with it differently.

'I'm very surprised and if Roy could turn back the clock, I don't think he would do it and say it the way he did because he has caused Raheem a problem and he wouldn't want to do that.'

And Murphy, who won nine caps for England, does not believe that Sterling deserves to be criticised for admitting he was tired.

He added: ‘The way he plays, with that power and that speed, he gives everything and he needs to be on top of his game,” he continued.

'If he is genuinely tired and he was honest for the team, then fair play to him.

‘Let's not make it a great deal. The lad has expressed it, Roy has made the decision not to play him and we have won.'
