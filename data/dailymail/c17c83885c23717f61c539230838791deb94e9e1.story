Britain cannot go on as a 'bloated, high-taxing, welfare-heavy nation', David Cameron warned today as he set out the 'moral case' for tax cuts.

The Prime Minister said it was 'morally wrong' for the government to spend money 'as if it grows on trees'.

He said major changes to the tax system introduced by the coalition and promised by the Tories will mean the average worker get a £3,800 income tax cut between 2015 and 2020.

Prime Minister David Cameron said there was a 'moral case' for cutting taxes to 'incentivise' work'

Mr Cameron vowed that tax cuts could go ahead even while spending cuts are being made to balance the books.

He argued that it was better to ‘incentivise work’ instead of allowing people to languish on welfare, and improved people’s living standards.

The Tories have put two major tax cuts at the heart of their bid for re-election.

At the Conservative conference earlier this month, Mr Cameron promised that no-one earning the minimum wage - equivalent to £12,500-a-year - would pay any income tax at all, he said, giving a tax cut to 30million people.

He also announced the point at which the 40p tax rate is levied would rise from around £42,000 to £50,000 - a huge boost for middle class families. 

The two commitments, which he later pledged to start implementing straight away even before the deficit is due to be eliminated, will cost £7.2bn a year which is as yet unfunded.

It prompted speculation that departments such as schools, defence and local government could be asked to take major budget cuts if the Tories win the next election.

In an article justifying the move today, the Prime Minister said cutting taxes was at the heart of his pitch for the next election and drew a ‘stark choice’ between the Conservatives and Labour.

‘Nowhere is the contrast more stark than on taxation’, he wrote in The Times. ‘Labour wants to put up taxes on people’s homes, jobs, pensions — even their deaths.

'Conservatives are committed to cutting your taxes. We know the economic case for cutting taxes: in a competitive world we cannot afford to carry on as a bloated, high-taxing, welfare-heavy nation.

‘We have to direct our resources to incentivising work through tax cuts and not incentivising welfare through extra benefit entitlements.

‘We have to fight the notion that you can endlessly suck more taxes out of businesses and bite the hand that feeds…For me, the simplest way to help with living standards is this: allow people to take home more of their own money.’

In Mr Cameron’s first comment on how these tax cuts would be funded, he said they would be ‘hard but doable’.

George Osborne has already announced the next government would have to make £25bn worth of savings, starting with a new squeeze on welfare for those aged under 21.

He went on to say that apart from the economic case there was also a ‘moral case’.

He wrote: ‘It is morally right that the rich pay their fair share in tax; and right that those who are able to contribute to our public services and safety nets do so. But what is morally wrong is government spending money as if it grows on trees.

‘Every single pound of public money started as private earning…a huge amount of hard work: early morning alarms, long commutes, hours spent on the factory floor, the office, the hospital ward or the classroom.

‘On the other side of the coin are those who work hard, many on low incomes, who would desperately like to spend more money on their family.’

The article suggests Mr Cameron will try and see off the threat from Ukip with an attractive economic pitch – offering tax cuts to those struggling on low incomes.

But Labour’s Chris Leslie the Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said the promises were not borne out by Mr Cameron’s actions. ‘While millionaires have been given a huge tax cut, ordinary working people are paying more because he raised VAT and cut tax credits’, Mr Leslie said.

‘Independent figures from the IFS show that by next year families will be £974 a year worse off because of tax and benefit changes since 2010.

And David Cameron still won’t rule out raising VAT again on families and pensioners to pay for £7 billion of unfunded tax promises.’

Chris Leslie MP, Labour’s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, responding to David Cameron’s article in The Times, said: ‘David Cameron will be judged on his actions, not his words. He’s raised taxes 24 times. While millionaires have been given a huge tax cut, ordinary working people are paying more because he raised VAT and cut tax credits.

‘Independent figures from the IFS show that by next year families will be £974 a year worse off because of tax and benefit changes since 2010. And David Cameron still won’t rule out raising VAT again on families and pen-sioners to pay for £7 billion of unfunded tax promises.

‘Labour’s economic plan will introduce a lower 10p starting rate of tax for 24 million people on middle and low incomes and cut business rates for small firms.

‘We will tackle tax avoidance and introduce a mansion tax to invest in our National Health Service. And to balance the books in a fairer way we’ll reverse David Cameron’s £3 billion tax cut for the top one per cent of earners.”
