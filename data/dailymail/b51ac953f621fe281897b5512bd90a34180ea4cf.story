A New Hampshire man playing video games Tuesday night got a taste of real life violence when a rogue bullet hit him in the head.

Josh Demeritt, 20, of Rochester was surprisingly uninjured by the bullet accidentally fired by his across-the-street neighbor Corey Field, 25, who was in the middle of cleaning his gun.

But because Field tried to cover up the accident, he is facing two felony charges.

Lucky: Josh Demeritt was playing video games Tuesday night when he was accidentally shot by his neighbor across the street who was cleaning his gun

Maintenance: Neighbor Corey Field, 25 (right), was cleaning his gun when it accidentally shot off, going through a window, curtains and wall before striking Mr Demeritt

Mr Demeritt was sitting on his bed playing a video game when the accidental shooting happened.

'Next thing I know I heard a loud noise, and I see some paint flying across the room,' Mr Demeritt told CBS Boston. 'I see the mark on the wall, I feel something hit me in the top of my head, and I thought somebody threw something in the room at first.'

The bullet went through a window, curtains and a wall before striking Mr Demeritt.

'I ended up finding the bullet on the floor right next to where I was sitting,' said Mr Demeritt.

Police responded to Mr Demeritt's apartment home at 15 Leonard Street and surmised that the bullet originated from a third-floor apartment at 16 Leonard, across the street.

Unscathed: Mr Demeritt escaped injury because the bullet had slowed down considerably by the time it hit him on the top of the head

They were surprised to find Mr Demeritt in such good condition after being hit.

'He was lucky that the bullet had gone through enough of the structures to run out of energy,' said Captain Paul Toussaint of the Rochester Police Department.

When they turned up to interview Field, they discovered there was a warrant out for his arrest for failing to appear at an arraignment for a pending driving-after-suspension charge.

While being questioned by police, Field admitting to shooting the gun and hiding it. He led police to a snow bank behind a laundromat where he hid the gun and handed over a crushed soda can in his room containing the bullet casing.

Trouble: Field is facing two felony charges related to the shooting. Above, a reporter outside Field's apartment where he shot the gun

Cooperating with police still didn't get Field out of trouble though.

On Wednesday he was arraigned on two charges, one felony count of reckless conduct for shooting off the firearm and placing others in danger, and one felony count of falsifying physical evidence for hiding the gun and casing.

Field was held overnight at the Strafford County Jail, and released the following day on $5,000 cash bail.

His next hearing is January 22.Â
