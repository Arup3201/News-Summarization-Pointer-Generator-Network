Richard Mellon Scaife, the billionaire heir to the Mellon banking and
 oil fortune and a newspaper publisher who funded libertarian and 
conservative causes and various projects to discredit President Bill 
Clinton, has died. He was 82.

Scaife died early Friday at his 
home, his newspaper, the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, reported. Scaife's 
death comes less than two months after he announced in a first-person, 
front-page story in his Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that he had an 
untreatable form of cancer.

Richard Mellon Scaife, the billionaire heir to the Mellon banking and oil fortune and a newspaper publisher who funded libertarian and conservative causes and various projects to discredit President Bill Clinton, has died at the age of 82

'Some who dislike me may rejoice at the news,' wrote 
Scaife, who acknowledged making political and other enemies. 'Naturally,
 I can't share their enthusiasm.'

He was the grand-nephew of Andrew Mellon, a banker and secretary of 
the Treasury who was involved with some of the biggest industrial 
companies of the early 20th century.

Forbes magazine estimated Scaife's 
net worth in 2013 at $1.4 billion.

The intensely private Scaife became widely known in the 1990s when 
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton said her husband was being attacked by
 a 'vast right-wing conspiracy.' White House staffers and other 
supporters suggested Scaife was playing a central role in the attack.

Several foundations controlled by Scaife gave millions of dollars to 
organizations run by critics of Clinton, including $1.7 million for a 
project at the conservative American Spectator magazine to dig up 
information about his role in the Whitewater real estate scandal.

Scaife rarely gave interviews, but in a sit-down with George magazine
 editor John F. Kennedy Jr. in 1998, he called President Clinton 'an 
embarrassment.'

In the interview, Scaife denied that his money helped support an 
effort to hurt the president, but he suggested Clinton might be linked 
to the deaths of dozens of administration officials and associates, 
including White House Deputy Counsel Vince Foster and onetime Commerce 
Secretary Ron Brown. Foster's death was determined to be a suicide; 
Brown died in a plane crash.

Scaife also accused Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel whose 
investigation led to Clinton's impeachment in the Monica Lewinsky sex 
scandal, to be a 'mole working for the Democrats.'

Scaife's stance toward the Clintons softened years later. In an 
interview published in early 2008, he told Vanity Fair magazine he and 
the former president had a 'very pleasant' lunch the previous summer, 
and 'I never met such a charismatic man in my whole life.'

Clinton gave Scaife an autographed copy of his book, and Scaife said 
he later sent $100,000 to the Clinton Global Initiative. (Scaife also 
said philandering 'is something that Bill Clinton and I have in 
common.')

Scaife's newspaper also endorsed Hillary Rodham Clinton's bid for president in 2008.

Despite funding many causes dear to conservatives, Scaife was 
libertarian on many social issues. He supported Planned Parenthood and 
abortion rights, supported legalizing same-sex marriage and marijuana, 
and opposed the invasion of Iraq in 2003.

Scaife bought the Tribune-Review in suburban Pittsburgh in 1969, using its editorial pages to trumpet his views.

'I fell in love with newspapers as a boy, when my father bought me 
editions from around the country and abroad,' Scaife told readers in the
 column announcing his cancer diagnosis. 'The day I became a newspaper 
publisher, buying the Tribune-Review, remains one of the proudest, 
happiest moments of my life.'

Scaife was a longtime supporter of Republicans, backing presidential 
candidate Barry Goldwater in 1964 and heavily funding the 1968 campaign 
of Richard Nixon.

In 1972, Scaife donated $1 million to Nixon in 334 separate checks to
 avoid paying gift taxes.

After The Associated Press wrote a story about
 the money, Scaife insisted the Tribune-Review get rid of its AP 
service.

'He ordered us to come in and take out the wire machines that night,'
 Pat Minarcin, then AP's Pittsburgh bureau chief, told The Wall Street 
Journal for a 1995 story.

Scaife also made headlines in recent years during a bitter divorce 
battle with Margaret Ritchie Battle Scaife, his second wife.

The divorce
 was finalized in 2012. His first marriage, to Frances Gilmore Scaife, 
also ended in divorce.

A Pittsburgh native, Richard Mellon Scaife was born in 1932, the son 
of Sarah Cordelia Mellon and Alan Magee Scaife.

His mother was an 
alcoholic, and his upbringing has been described as cold and unhappy. He
 and his sister were raised by nannies.

He went to Yale but was expelled during his freshman year after a he 
rolled a beer keg down a flight of stairs, breaking the legs of a 
classmate, according to a 1999 story in The Washington Post.

Scaife admitted to becoming an alcoholic, and he had a reputation for
 having a fiery temper. He reportedly quit drinking in 1990 after going 
to the Betty Ford Clinic.

The Tribune-Review reported Scaife is survived by a daughter, Jennie 
K. Scaife, a son, David N. Scaife, a daughter-in-law, Sara Scaife; and 
two grandchildren.

The newspaper reported that a private memorial service would be held at a later date
