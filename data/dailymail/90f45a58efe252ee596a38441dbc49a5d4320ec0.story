The New York's Police Commissioner has offered a $12,000 reward for the arrest and conviction of seven people who  attacked two lieutenants on the Brooklyn Bridge.

Police Commissioner Bill Bratton released pictures of the seven suspects officers believe were involved in a clash between protesters and the lieutenants during a march calling for justice for Eric Garner on Sunday. 

The incident began when the two officers arrested a City University of New York professor, Eric Linsker, 29, as he tried to pour a rubbish bin onto other cops from a pedestrian overpass.

They were punched and kicked in the heads, leaving them needing instant medical attention.

Ironically, the officers were from the department's Legal Bureau and were only present at the protest to ensure that demonstrators' civil rights were respected by police.

Female suspects two and three - the women were among the first to attack

Police have now found images of four men and three women they believe were involved in the attack, enhanced from a two minute YouTube video. 

The video shows the women and one of the men were the first to attack Lt Patrick Sullivan and Lt Patrick Chan, the New York Post reports.

Male Number 3 and Male Number 4 get involved later, kicking the officers and pulling them to the ground. 

Male number 4 ends the attack by punching Lt. Chan, whose nose was broken in the assault.

Lt Sullivan was left with cuts and bruises. 

Bratton is hoping the offer of the reward - as well as the release of images of people who witnessed the attack - will mean he can bring the attackers to justice. 

'It's to the benefit of the organizers of these marches, and the participants, to work with us,' Bratton said.

Bratton, who referred to the suspects as 'agitators and anarchists', added: 'Their world is a very different world often times than the world the rest of us live in. They don't like government, they don't society, they don't like anything. 

'So they're seeking to take advantage of it.' 

His tone is in stark contrast to that of New York's mayor, Bill de Blasio, who was branded a 'total nicompoop' after he used the word 'allegedly' to describe a mob assault by protesters on two police lieutenants. 

 

Demonstrators marched over the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday during the Justice for All rally and march

It is thought 25,000 to 30,000 people joined the rally, which left two officers needing medical attention

It was just one of many similar protests across the country 

Thousands of
demonstrators marched in Washington, New York, Boston, Chicago and Oakland on
Saturday to protest against killings of unarmed black men by
police officers.

Organizers said the marches were among the largest in a
recent wave of protests against the deaths that have cast a
global spotlight on race relations in the United States.

The rallies were mainly peaceful, though police in Boston
said they arrested 23 people who tried to block a highway.

Officers in Oakland, California said they detained about 45
people for vandalism, failure to disperse, resisting arrest and
other charges after thousands took to the
streets.

Decisions by grand juries to return no indictments against
the officers involved in the deaths of Michael Brown in Missouri
and Eric Garner in New York have put police treatment of
minorities back on the national agenda.

'We're going to keep the light on Mike Brown ... on all of
the victims. The only way you make roaches run is to keep the
light on,' said civil rights leader the Rev. Al Sharpton, whose
National Action Network organized the Washington rally. 

Marchers, including many parents with children, chanted 'No
justice, no peace, no racist police' and 'Hands up, don't
shoot.' Protesters carried signs that said 'All men are created
equal' and 'Black lives matter.'

Relatives of Eric Garner and Akai Gurley, who were killed by
New York police, Brown and Trayvon Martin,slain by a Florida
neighborhood watchman in 2012, all took part in the Washington
rally

 NYPD top brass are furious at de Blasio's implication that the beating may not have happened, claiming no such skepticism is ever shown when officers are accused of violence against civilians. 

NYPD has also released images of a number of witnesses to the assault who they hope will be able to secure a conviction.

It is thought a number of the witnesses were using mobile phones to record the attack, while a man wearing a bright green baseball cap is believed to have been at the march as a legal observer for the National Lawyers Guild. 

This incident the latest controversy in a long-running stand off between New Yorkers and police following a spate of deaths in custody.

They include the death of Eric Garner, a 43-year-old black man who died when officer Daniel Pantaleo attempted to subdue him in Tompkinsville, Staten Island, on July 17, with 'chokehold' restraining technique that is banned under NYPD protocol.

Then, last week, a grand jury in Staten Island sparked global outrage after it refused to indict Pantaleo over the chokehold that killed the father-of-six.

The confrontation began when Pantaleo arrested him for illegally selling cigarettes on the street.

In the ensuing tussle, the officer put Garner in the controversial headlock moments before Garner was heard saying: 'I can't breathe.'

They turned out to be the last words he ever spoke. He passed out and later died in hospital.

His final words became a rallying cry for thousands of protesters who took to the streets in New York and other citiesafter Pantaleo escaped indictment.
