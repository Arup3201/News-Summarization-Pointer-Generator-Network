More than 10,000 adrenaline junkies took on 'America's toughest obstacle course' in California on Sunday with a photographer on hand to document their pain-stricken faces.

Lucy Nicholson of Reuters snapped away at various points on the 12-mile Tough Mudder course in San Bernardino as contestants courageously made their way through mud pits, iceberg baths and fields of live wires in almost 90-degree heat.

One shot shows a man in seeming agony as he's shocked by electric wires while another shows a contestant welling up as he crawls through a haze of tear gas.

Later in the course, a couple were photographed sharing a passionate embrace after navigating a tunnel of barbed wire. Both of their  T-shirts appear coated with dirt.

Tough Mudder, which was started by two Harvard Business School graduates in 2010, is an endurance event series which now takes place all over the world.

Despite the rather unpleasant obstacles, the events have become so popular that many of them sell out weeks in advance.

One participant at Sunday's Tough Mudder in California explained why he had signed up for a second year running. 

'It's about being with your friends, pushing through. Everyone here is your friend, everyone's your family. That's all there is to it. Anyone can do it,' he told Ruptly TV.

At the end of the course, contestants are rewarded with a Tough Mudder sweatband and an ice cold beer.   

At most events, Tough Mudder also offers tattoos of its logo to all finishers who want to commemorate their achievement.

The event founders highlight that Tough Mudder is a 'personal challenge' and not a race, therefore no-one is timed and no medals are given out. 

However, participants generally finish the booby-trapped tracks in around three hours.

The next Tough Mudder events are set to take place on May 2 and 3 in London, Texas and Atlanta.

The average age of contributors is 29, with 70 per cent male and 30 per cent female.
