A teenager suffering from anorexia cured herself of the crippling eating disorder while on holiday at Disney World in Florida.

Heather Franks, from Stoke-On-Trent, was on the verge of being admitted to hospital by after her weight dropped to six stone.

But instead, the 17-year-old went with her family to the U.S. - and credits the trip with her recovery.

Surrounded by larger portions and people who treated food normally, the teenager began to put on weight.

Heather Franks overcame her crippling anorexia after visiting Disneyland in Florida with her family. At her lightest the 17-year-old weighed six stone, left at her school prom. Today Heather is a healthy 10 stone, right

She said: 'When we got to Disney World I was sat in a restaurant where nobody knew me or my eating problems, and I just felt so different.

'My parents let me choose whatever I wanted to eat, and slowly but surely I started to feel more comfortable around food.

'The portions were bigger and there was so many different things to try.

'The first thing I ate out there was a cheese and tomato pizza, and I actually enjoyed it.

'It changed my outlook on food, and that continued when we got home.

'When my doctors told me that I should go to hospital rather than go on holiday I was devastated.

'But in the end, going to Disney World is the best thing I’ve ever done.'

When she was 16, Heather first began suffering anorexia.

Within a year, her condition became so severe that doctors advised she should be admitted to hospital.

She said: 'When I was told I couldn’t go to Disney World that was really the breaking point for me.

'I spoke to my parents and they agreed that I could still go with them, but I knew that if I didn’t put on weight I would end up in hospital.

'At Disney World I was so weak that I had to go around the park in a wheelchair.

As a child Heather was overweight, eating around 1,500 calories for breakfast alone

But by the age of 16, following a fall out with friends which led to depression, the teenager developed anorexia, leaving doctors so concerned they advised she should be hosptialised

'Luckily, everything changed after a few days there. I put on weight and I continued to do so when we got home.'

Heather, who as a child had been overweight, said she used to eat around 1,500 calories for breakfast alone.

She said: 'Luckily I managed to lose it as I grew up.

'I was completely fine with my body and how I looked, but in 2011 I fell out with my friends and developed depression.

'I was seeing a counselor but in April 2013 she went away on holiday, and whilst she was gone I found it difficult to control my emotions and how I felt.

'Before we went away I was days away from going to hospital. But in Disney World my perspective on things changed... I realised I just wanted to get on with my life'

'The only thing I was actually able to control was the amount of food I was eating - that’s where it all began.

'My counselor came back and noticed the difference in me and began to weigh me every week.

'Before long I was diagnosed with anorexia.

'I would just eat as little as I could - nothing for breakfast or lunch, and then I’d pick at my dinner at the table with my family.

'At my lowest I living off less than 500 calories a day. It was really hard for my family and friends to see my like that.

'I look back at pictures of me at my high school prom - at my thinnest - and I can’t believe how ill I looked.'

The turning point came while Heather was on holiday at Disney World.

'Before we went away I was days away from going to hospital,' she said. 'But in Disney World my perspective on things changed.

'I
 was away from the counselors and dieticians - I was just with my 
supportive family and around people who treated food normally.

Having overcome the illness, Heather now weighs 10 stone and is working to help raise awareness of eating disorders

'I put on 2lbs - which is a lot when all you want to do is lose weight - and then when I got back I continued to gain.

'I realised that I just wanted to get on with my life.'

Despite her life-changing visit, Heather said she is unlikely to return to the famous resort.

'Disney World has a lot of good memories for me but I’m not sure I’ll go back,' she said.

'I loved my holiday there, but it reminds me of how extremely ill I was.

'But it’s the place and time where I went through the biggest turning point in my life - I’ll always remember it.'

Heather weighs almost 10 stone and has made it her aim to raise awareness of eating disorders.

She said: 'I’m not ashamed at all of what I’ve been through.

'It’s thanks to my wonderful family and friends that I’m still here, ad I’m really happy now.

'I’m also fundraising with the eating disorder charity, BEAT, so they can help other young people like me.

'I’m just looking forward to the future.'
