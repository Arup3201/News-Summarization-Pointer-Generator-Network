For once, she was truly in the driving seat. Despite a tight-fitting LK Bennett dress and skyscraper heels, the Duchess of Cambridge firmly rejected her husband’s offer of a back seat as she stepped elegantly into the front of a Super Hornet fighter jet yesterday.

It was a fitting symbol of the Kate-mania that has erupted in Australia, as thousands of people chanted her name on the 13th day of the Royal tour.

Former RAF pilot Prince William, who once famously romanced Kate by landing his helicopter next to her family home, had asked his wife: ‘Do you fancy jumping in the back?’ as they took a tour of the Royal Australian Air Force base Amberley in Brisbane, Queensland. But the Duchess, wearing a £245 lasa poppy dress which has already sold out, was having none of it, asking officials if she could try out the controls instead.

Jasmine Richards, a 25-year-old flight lieutenant who was standing next to the couple, said: ‘Kate asked if she would be able to get in and  I said, “Yes, if you’re careful,”  and William said, “Oh my goodness, really?” He kept telling Kate to  be careful.’

It was an action-packed day for the couple, who later drew crowds of more than 10,000 for a walkabout in the city, before enjoying their first night off official duties at a rugby game, watching the New South Wales Waratahs take on South Africa’s Bulls.

On Brisbane’s South Bank, scenes  were similar to when the late Princess of Wales visited the city, and locals also compared the hysteria to that faced by One Direction.

Thousands chanted ‘Kate, Kate, Kate’, as they thrust gifts at her and fought for space to take a ‘selfie’. Some people had camped out overnight to secure a decent spot.

As the mercury hit 28 degrees  
Celsius, at least three girls had to be treated by paramedics after 
fainting in the crowds, which were pressed against police barriers. When
 the Royals first appeared, 30 minutes late, fans screamed desperately 
to get Kate’s attention.

Looking
 at times bemused by the scenes before them, the Duke and Duchess 
obliged, posing for pictures and shaking thousands of outstretched 
hands. Stephen Hicks, a 
56-year-old carpenter, said: ‘Kate looked radiant. When I saw her up 
close, it was like, “Wow!” She is really spectacular.’

Anna
 Legge, who was with her seven-year-old daughter, managed to hand Kate a
 bouquet of flowers and a friendship bracelet when she strolled over to 
chat. ‘She was so lovely to stop and talk. We weren’t expecting it and 
couldn’t believe it when she did,’ said Mrs Legge. ‘We cannot believe 
our luck.

The stunning
 success of the Royal tour has, The Mail on Sunday understands, 
delighted the Queen, who celebrates her 88th birthday tomorrow. Her 
Majesty is said to be ‘thrilled’ by the way her grandson and his young 
family have been received, and she is keeping up  with their progress 
via TV news bulletins. And despite eight-month-old Prince George 
stealing most of the headlines, it is Kate who has come in to her own.

She
 has found a clear new role in promoting the children’s hospice movement
 and has made an emotional connection with the families she has met.

Mother-of-two
 Nicole Pearce, who lost her 41-year-old husband, Trooper David Pearce, 
in a roadside bomb attack in Afghanistan seven years ago, said after 
meeting the Duchess at RAAF Amberley: ‘Kate was sincerely sad for us. 
David was only over there for two weeks when he was killed. She seemed 
very genuine. She was very sweet.’

Kate
 gave a moving speech at Bear Cottage children’s hospice in Manly on 
Friday as part of an international campaign to highlight the care of 
desperately ill children.

She
 has also pledged to help Australia to build more children’s care 
centres as part of her philanthropic mission. At a state reception 
yesterday afternoon, the Duchess vowed to help the country open more 
children’s hospices.

She
 met Paul and Gabrielle Quilliam, the founders of the charity Queensland
 Kids, who plan to open Hummingbird House, a new hospice, next year. 
‘The Duchess said she was surprised and concerned that there are only 
two children’s hospices in Australia,’ said Gabrielle, who met Kate at 
the Brisbane  Convention Centre.

Kate is mobbed by fans in Brisbane following a reception hosted by the Governor and Premier of Queensland. They will be returning to Sydney, where Prince George is, this evening

‘She
 said it has galvanised her into taking action. She was asking about the
 timeline for the build of the Hummingbird, and we said hopefully next 
year.

‘She said to keep her informed and that she would love to come and see it when it opens up.’

Perhaps another Australian adventure is already in the pipeline.
