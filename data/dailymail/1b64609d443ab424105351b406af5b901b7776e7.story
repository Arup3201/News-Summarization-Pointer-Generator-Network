Michael Palin will instead tour with his own solo show shelving plans for Monty Python to take their farewell shows to America

The Monty Python team have had to shelve plans to take their sellout show to America after one member of the veteran comedy outfit said he was too busy to go.

Michael Palin will instead tour with his own solo show, a month after the Pythons’ farewell London performances at the 02 in July.

Fellow Python Terry Jones told Reader's Digest magazine that while four members of the veteran comedy outfit were keen to take the money-spinning comeback shows to America following their performances in London later this summer, Michael Palin rejected the idea.

Instead, the actor and presenter will now go on tour with his own solo show, just a month after the Pythons’ farewell performances at the 02 in July, the 70-year-old will embark on a 21-date tour to mark the publication of the third volume of his diaries.

These cover his television-travel debut on Around the World in Eighty Days as well as looking back at his life as a shy schoolboy in Sheffield.

Asked about whether they had plans to take the show abroad, Jones, 72, told Readers Digest magazine: ‘Everybody else agreed to do the show in America, but Mike Palin says he’s too busy…’

The group have already overcome a series of rows over the decades in order to return to the stage for a series of ten shows that are expected to net each member of the group up to £1m. Tickets for the shows sold out within minutes of going on sale and is one of the most eagerly-awaited shows in history.

They first discussed reuniting in 1999, but Palin again pulled out at the last minute, reportedly angering Idle, who had worked on the project. He has since claimed that he felt uncomfortable performing as a group without Graham Chapman — the sixth Python who died of cancer aged 48 in 1989.

There were also strains within the group over Idle’s idea to make a sequel to their hit film Holy Grail. When Cleese decided not to take part, the project was dropped.

Cleese and Idle reportedly fell out in 2011 when Idle axed the Fawlty Towers star’s voiceover from hit musical Spamalot, denying him royalty payments.

Cleese tweeted that Eric was ‘Yoko Idle’ — a reference to Yoko Ono’s role in causing tension among The Beatles.

However, the new stage show will begin in July, with Jones revealing it will feature dance routines performed by scantily clad dancers.

He said: ‘Eric Idle is directing and has written the script, dusting off some old classics and giving them a modern twist. Eric has already met with the choreographer Arlene Phillips. They’ll be 20 dancers. All the girls are wearing Agent Provocateur underwear. I don’t know what they’re going to do, though.

‘Eric has also picked some sketches that we’ve never done on stage before, like the Spanish Inquisition.

‘In the slapstick lecture that closes Act One, I have to fall over a lot and get hit on the head with planks and things like that. I’m not sure how this is going to happen – we’re going to have to work out some padding.

‘It might look a bit odd with a lot of grey-haired people getting bashed up. Eric says we should all get fit, but I walk the dog for an hour on Hampstead Heath every day and I’m hoping that’s enough.’

The group made 45 episodes of Monty Python’s Flying Circus between 1969 and 1974, including sketches such as the Dead Parrot, Spam, The Lumberjack Song and The Spanish Inquisition.

Their first movie, And Now For Something Completely Different, was released in 1971. Monty Python and the Holy Grail came out in 1975, while Monty Python’s Life of Brian followed four years later.

Their final film, Monty Python’s the Meaning of Life, was released the next year.

It proved to be the last time the six Pythons worked together on a full-time project.

Their last live performance came in 1982 at the Hollywood Bowl.
