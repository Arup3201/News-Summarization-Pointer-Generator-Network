Convicted child molester Yova Kana Shaday, 69, requested to be released from a New York prison so that he could donate to a sperm bank 

A convicted child molester begged a New York judge for permission to leave jail so that he could donate to a sperm bank and have a chance to procreate.

Yova Kana Shaday, 69, said he was being robbed of his 'last opportunity to be fruitful and multiply' in the letter filed at Brooklyn Federal Court. 

Shaday said he feared that, if imprisoned, he would be too old to donate his sperm once released.

He wrote that he prayed the court would consider the 'very serious truth in releasing me' and warned  that 'the gravity of this extenuating circumstance is in your hands'.

The letter signs off with Shaday's hope that 'your god lead you to be fruitful and multiply,' before he adds in a 'P.S' that his sperm donation was intended for an unnamed 'specific receiver,' according to the New York Daily News.

Federal Judge Edward Korman swiftly denied Shaday's request.

Shaday is currently incarcerated at the Queens Correctional Facility.

He is awaiting trial for failing to register as a sex offender in New York. If convicted, Shaday faces up to 10 years in prison.

Police received a tip in November that Shaday was living under a fake name in Brooklyn, a fact they confirmed after showing his mugshot to neighbors. 

The request was filed to Brooklyn Federal Court (pictured) and was swiftly denied by Federal Judge Edward Korman. Shaday is currently awaiting trial for failing to register as a sex offender 

They then nabbed Shaday when he reported his bicycle was missing to the NYPD under his alias, Lucas Avram. Shaday is supposed to register as a sex offender every year for the rest of his life,

According to court papers, Shaday has been convicted twice in California for molesting minors. 

Shaday pleaded guilty to committing a lewd act with a child under the age of 14 in 2005 and was sentenced to three years in prison.

He then pleaded guilty to molesting a child under the age of 18 in 2008 and served 180 days in jail.
