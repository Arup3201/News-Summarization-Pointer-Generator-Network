The divorcee who is on course to become France’s next first lady today suggested she will be a far more modest one than Carla Bruni.

Valerie Trierweiler, 47, is the partner of Francois Hollande, the Socialist who is runaway favourite to replace Nicolas Sarkozy as President in less than two weeks’ time.

If Hollande does win – and the latest polls put him an astonishing ten points ahead of Sarkozy – Ms Treierweiler will become the first Premier Dame in French history to be unmarried.

Speaking out: Valerie Trierweiler, pictured, is on course to become France's next first lady and has suggested that she will be a more modest one than Carla Bruni. Miss Trierweiler is pictured leaving Francois Hollade's campaign headquarters yesterday

In an interview in which she discusses her likely new role, Ms Trierweiler suggests that she would remain in the shadows, saying: ‘I will stay among those accompanying. I will bend to protocol. But it will be for me to find my place.

‘First Lady is not something I’ve ever dreamed of because I’ve never imagined finding myself in this position. I’m beginning to ask myself about it but only for a short while. What I’m scared of is losing my liberty.’

Miss Bruni, the former supermodel and pop singer, has taken centre stage since becoming Mr Sarkozy’s third wife following a whirlwind romance of just 80 days in 2008.

She has become renowned for keeping a near-empty official diary, ignoring many official functions, and even living in her own Paris town house or Riviera villa rather than at the Elysee Palace in Paris.

Pointedly, Ms Trierweiler does not mention Miss Bruni by name in her interview in the latest edition of Femme Actualle magazine.

But she praises the way Mr Sarkozy’s former wife, Cecilia Attias, introduced her three children to life at the Elysee Palace soon after becoming first lady in 2007.

Referring to her own three sons from a previous marriage, Ms Trierweiler said: ‘Cecilia entered the Elysee with a her recomposed family, I think that’s right if her children are in agreement.

‘As far as we’re concerned we haven’t spoken about it yet. It’s up to them to decide, but I’ve got the feeling that they won’t want to.’

Miss Bruni, a one time champagne Socialist with a string of celebrity lovers including Mick Jagger behind her, has often been accused of marrying Mr Sarkozy simply because he was the President.

But Ms Trierweiler, a magazine journalist, said of Mr Hollande: ‘When I’m by his side I’m simply his woman, with everything that implies, just like any woman in love. I tell him what I think, I advise him, but I particularly avoid discussing politics.

‘I didn’t shy away from getting involved. I’ve always loved politics, meetings and the Left. And I adore listening to Francois. Of course, clapping the man I love while remaining a journalist was a problem for me.

'But not any longer. I raise my hands and clap him like a footballers’ wife!

‘I would like the French to think of me as the woman I really am, someone who is disinterested and simple. I am not with Francois because he became a candidate for the presidency, I love him for what he is, not for what he could be.

‘Francois trusts me completely, except when I Tweet! Some people would like to see me react less on social network, but everybody respects my freedom. I have character and nobody can restrain me.’

Mr Hollande, who has never been married, started seeing Ms Trierweiler following the collapse of his relationship to fellow Socialist Segolene Royal, with whom he has four grown-up children.

As far as her personal life with Mr Hollande is concerned, Ms Trierweiler says he is always leaving doors open, but who does the housework, shopping and ‘cooking – with lots of butter!’

Hollande won the first, 10 candidate round of the election by 28.6 per cent to 27.2 per cent for Sarkozy, and the two will now be involved in a head-to-head on Sunday week.

An Ifop opinion poll published today showed Hollande on 55 per cent of the vote, 10 points ahead of Sarkozy.

The President is, in turn, trying to win over six million people who voted for the far right National Front on Sunday and could hold the key to the second round.

Split: Johnny Hallyday, pictured, arguably the most popular singer in France, has refused to back Nicolas Sarkozy in the presidential run-off

Nicolas Sarkozy’s week just got worse - his biggest celebrity supporter has refused to back him in the presidential run-off.

News
that Johnny Hallyday, arguably the most popular singer in France, has 
withdrawn his support will come as a huge blow to the head of state.

Sarkozy
famously invited Hallyday to a lavish lunch on the Champs Elysee 
following his election in 2007, promising the Elvis impersonator big tax
breaks.

There is even a famous video of Sarkozy performing a karaoke
version of Hallyday’s song Gabrielle on TV. Hallyday, now 68, is 
massively popular among millions of French people.

In an interview with Republican Lorraine, Hallyday said he had 
enjoyed a dinner with Sarkozy’s Socialist rival, Francois Hollande, and 
found him ‘charming’.

Asked if he would back Sarkozy, as he did in 
2007, Hallyday said: ‘I’ve no intention of giving my opinion on 
anything.

‘I don’t think it’s the role of an artist to speak out.

'I have
to admit I’ve done that in the past and I was wrong.’
