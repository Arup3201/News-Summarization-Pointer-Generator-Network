A staggering 58 languages are spoken by children at just one junior school in a small English town.

Some 471 pupils aged from 3 - 11 speak almost five dozen different languages at Hillside Community Primary School in Ipswich, Suffolk.

An astonishing cocktail of 130 languages are spoken at schools in largely-rural Suffolk, a Freedom of Information request shows.

Hillside Community Primary School headteacher Lee Abbott said there was a 'misconception' the children had no knowledge of English and lots of time and money spent on them

Lee Abbott, headteacher of Hillside Community Primary School, said: 'One of the challenges is the misconception that these children have no English and there is a great deal of time and money spent on these families and that simply isn’t the case.'

The most common minority languages spoken
 at the mixed school are Portuguese, Polish and Lithuanian, with 
each representing between 3 - 4 per cent of the total.

Mr Abbott defiantly insisted that students whose native tongue was not English are often not far behind their classmates.

'Our English-speaking children come with very poor communication skills anyway, when they first come in,' he argued. 'At that point at reception age, whether they have got English as an additional language or as a first language, the language development is a priority, the process is the same, and language acquisition is about the same rate.'

However Mr Abbott did admit that it was not always easy communicating with immigrant parents.

'There are parents we would need to write but we can’t because they don’t have literacy skills,' he said.

He also denied that non-English speaking pupils diverted attention from English kids.

'We track the progress of all of the 
children to make sure the resources are targeted at children who aren’t 
progressing at the right rate.'

Children who arrive without a good grasp of English do not sit in regular English classes but receive up to eight weeks of intensive instruction in ‘English as an Additional Language’ from a qualified teacher.

For other classes youngsters are taught the vocabulary that they will need the week before it comes up in lessons.

Hillside also employs teachers who speak a range of languages, including Polish, French, Swedish and Punjabi.

Mr Abbott said immigrant families are 'generally aspirational, they want their children to do well'.

Graham White, secretary of the National Union of Teachers in Suffolk, admitted teachers often had 'difficulty' communicating with pupils who didn’t speak English.

Mr White said: 'In my own school we had some Polish children come and we had someone who came in as an interpreter for a while.'

He also said pupils who didn’t speak English could receive too much attention from teachers.

'That’s always going to be a potential danger but teachers are going to make sure they devote attention to all the pupils,' said Mr White.

'But say you have got 30 pupils and 10 don’t speak English obviously you are going to spend a disproportionate amount of time on those children because it takes longer to explain things to them.'

Graham White, secretary of the National Union of Teachers in Suffolk, admitted teachers had difficulty communicating with some pupils and said a disproportionate amount of time could be spent helping them

A Suffolk County Council spokesman said: 'If children have been educated in another education system with different curriculum content, it will obviously take a bit of time to learn the new language and have the same level of subject knowledge for some curriculum areas as their English-speaking peers.'

He added: 'A challenge for schools is often that of communicating with parents if the parents’ English is limited.'

Altogether 6,325 pupils out of a total of 97,000 do not have English as a first language throughout Suffolk.

Some 2,965 of those are in Ipswich, the most diverse borough in the East Anglian county.

The figures show that lower year groups have higher numbers of pupils for whom English is not a first language.

In Year 1 there are 679 pupils who speak English as an additional language in Suffolk, that’s compared to just five in Year 14.

Macedonian, Kurdish, and Igbo - a 
Nigerian tongue - are among kids’ mother languages at primary and 
secondary schools across the county, while the most common languages other than English are Polish, Portuguese and Lithuanian.
