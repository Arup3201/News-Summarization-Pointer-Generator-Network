The heart-stopping moment when two men leap across New York subway platforms has been captured on video and uploaded to YouTube.

The unidentified daredevils were on what appears to be an empty platform when they carried out the dangerous stunt.

The life-risking jumps took place at the 9th Avenue and 39st stop in Brooklyn on the D line.

The two men, who appear to be in their late teens or early twenties, begin the jump by standing at the very edge of the opposite platform which also opens on to a live track.

The first boy runs at the gap and leaps across, landing heavily on the edge before taking a tumble towards the track on the other side.

He is followed by his friend who has a similarly nerve-wracking close call all the while being filmed by a cameraman who can be heard howling with laughter over music.

The two boys then run off up the stairs on the opposite side. The video was posted on YouTube this weekend and has already attracted a host of negative comments about the dangerous antics.

In April, horrifying footage was also posted online of a group of youths playing chicken with a subway train moments before it pulled into a Brooklyn station.

The Metropolitan Transport Authority condemned the stunt, saying that hundreds of people were seriously injured by subway trains every year.

'Playing on or near subway tracks is one of the most dangerous things anyone can do,' a MTA spokesman said.

'And while you can't outlaw stupidity you have to remember that 146 people were struck by subway trains last year and 47 of them died as a result.'
