A sacked security guard has been found hanging inside his flat surrounded by thousands of pounds in unpaid bills - eight years after he committed suicide (picture posed by model)

The body of a depressed security guard has been found hanging inside his flat surrounded by thousands of pounds in unpaid bills – eight years after he committed suicide.

Thomas Ngin’s death in a Paris suburb is now being used as an example of how isolated people can become in modern society.

His body was only found after his £400,000 apartment was sold at auction and the new owner visited for the first time.

Mr Ngin, a 42-year-old immigrant from 
Cambodia, was fired from his job in the French capital in 2005, and was 
spending more and more time at home in nearby Bussy Saint Georges.

He
was involved in increasingly complicated legal proceedings with his 
former bosses, and was also having to shell out on loans repayments.

Mr Ngin cut off all contact with his two brothers and two sisters, and stopped speaking to friends as he became more depressed.

His obsessively neat lifestyle alienated him from other people, including a brother he had once lived with.

‘He was extremely neat, and he couldn't tolerate his brother's habits,’ one source told the Parisien newspaper.

Mr Ngin hung himself in 2005, but that did not stop the bills arriving. Some £12,000 worth built up on the floor of his apartment’s letterbox.

Those who were owed money had their letters ignored for years, leading Mr Ngin’s bank to finally seize his flat and put it up for auction for around £400,000.

Neighbours had voted for the sale, as the money would be used to pay back his fees to the residents’ association.

The apartment was sold on October 3 and the new purchaser found the horrifically decomposed corpse.

Explaining the flat sale, a legal source told the Parisien: ‘He would have received letters, but by definition this type of decision by a court doesn't require the consent or agreement of the individual concerned.’
