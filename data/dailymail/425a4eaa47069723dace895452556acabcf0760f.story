Four people have after died eating cantaloupe melons which were carrying the deadly listeria bacteria, officials have said.

More fatalities are feared after two more deaths were linked to the batch of infected fruits.

So far there are confirmed deaths in Colorado, one in Oklahoma and two in New Mexico.

Deadly: While millions enjoy the melons, a batch from Jensen Farms in Holly, Colorado is suspected to be infected with listeria which has killed four people

The illnesses have been traced to fruit from Jensen Farms in Holly, Colorado, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it had found listeria in samples of Jensen Farms' cantaloupe taken from a Denver store.

Samples taken from equipment and cantaloupe at the farm's packing facility also confirmed a match to the strain of the disease.

Listeria is often found in soil, plants, and food and it is fairly rare for people to die from infections.

Pasteurisation and cooking is normally enough to kill Listeria and itâ€™s often the elderly who die because they are not strong enough to fight infection.

It is also dangerous to pregnant women because it easily passes through to the foetus. Symptoms of listeria include fever and muscle aches, often with other gastrointestinal symptoms.

Officials say 35 people in 10 states have been suffered in the outbreak so far in California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia.

Bacteria: Listeria can spread from soil and rivers and generally kills elderly people who don't have strong immune systems

Colorado has been the most affected with 12 cases, followed by Oklahoma with six and New Mexico with five.

Anyone who has bought one of the suspected contaminated cantaloupes is being advised to throw it out immediately.

About 800 cases of listeria are found in the United States each year, according to CDC, and there usually are three or four outbreaks. Most of these are traced to deli meat and soft cheeses, where listeria is most common.

Produce has rarely been the culprit, but federal investigators say they have seen more produce-related listeria illnesses in the last two years. It was found in sprouts in 2009 and celery in 2010.
