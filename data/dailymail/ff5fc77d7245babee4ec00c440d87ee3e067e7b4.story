Tornadoes destroyed houses, tore up the roof of a maximum-security prison and injured people in northern Alabama as bad weather threatened more twisters across the region today - two days after a storm system killed 13 people in the Midwest and South.

Anxiety mounted from Georgia to southern Ohio across a wide swath where forecasters said severe weather could hit later in the day. Thousands of schoolchildren in several states were sent home as a precaution. Meanwhile, residents in parts of Illinois hit hard by storms earlier in the week salvaged what they could from damaged homes.

In the Huntsville area, five people were taken to hospitals, and several houses were leveled by what authorities believed were tornadoes this morning. The extent of the people's injuries was not immediately known, and emergency crews were continuing to survey damage. No deaths were reported.

At least 10 homes were damaged in a subdivision in Athens. Homeowner Bill Adams watched as two men ripped shingles off the roof of a house he rents out, and he fretted about predictions that more storms would pass through. 'Hopefully they can at least get a tarp on it before it starts again,' he said.

An apparent tornado also damaged a state maximum-security prison about 10 miles from Huntsville, but none of the facility's approximately 2,100 inmates escaped. Alabama Department of Corrections spokesman Brian Corbette said there were no reports of injuries, but the roof was damaged on two large prison dormitories that each hold about 250 men. Part of the perimeter fence was knocked down, but the prison was secure. 'It was reported you could see the sky through the roof of one of them,' Mr Corbette said.

Authorities are confident that storms that hit Limestone and Madison counties were tornadoes, but it will be up to the National Weather Service to confirm the twisters, said Alabama State Emergency Management Agency spokeswoman Yasamie August. 'We're still getting reports of damage pretty much as we speak,' she said at midday.

Forecasters warned of severe 
thunderstorms with the threat of tornadoes crossing a region from 
southern Ohio through much of Kentucky and Tennessee. By early Friday 
afternoon, tornado watches covered parts of those states along with 
Missouri, Illinois and Indiana.

In Norman, Oklahoma, forecasters at the Storm Prediction Center said they were bracing for what could be a potent tornado outbreak. 'Maybe five times a year we issue what is kind of the highest risk level for us at the Storm Prediction Center,' forecaster Corey Mead said. 'This is one of those days.'

Mead said a powerful storm system was interacting with humid, unstable air that was streaming north from the Gulf of Mexico. 'The environment just becomes more unstable and provides the fuel for the thunderstorms,' Mr Mead said.

Schools sent students home early or cancelled classes entirely in states including Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi and Kentucky. In Alabama alone, more than 20 school systems say they are dismissing classes early Friday because of the possibility of severe storms. The bad weather could hit around the time schools normally dismiss for the day, based on predictions from the National Weather Service.

Residents were picking through debris in parts of Illinois that were devastated by the previous round of severe weather on Wednesday. The 9,000-resident town of Harrisburg was sacked by a twister about 5 a.m. on Wednesday that killed six people. Forecasters weren't expecting the area to be hit hard by the newest storms, though.

The forecast in Harrisburg didn't much matter to Amanda Patrick, who lost her home on Wednesday, in the same twister that killed her neighbours in the area where most of the fatalities occurred.

'I don't know what to tell you other than I take it one moment, one day at a time,' Ms Patrick, 31, said a day after riding out the storm in the bathtub she barely was able to crawl into for shelter before the twister hit.

She considers herself blessed, having thought the sirens that wailed as the tornado barreled down on her neighborhood was actually part of her dream. She awakened just minutes before the tornado hit and hours later couldn't stop sobbing over the neighbors she lost.

'I'm not crying as much now. I'm here right now, standing,' she said Thursday. 'Now, I will get up every time I hear a siren.'
