The headmistress of the Indian school where 23 primary school pupils were killed by lunch contaminated with pesticides is on the run, as police claim she forced a reluctant cook to serve up the food.

Authorities say the cook had warned Meena Devi, head of the rural school in the eastern state of Bihar, that the cooking oil may have been contaminated.

She had complained that the oil looked strange and gave off a foil smell when heated, but her concerns were dismissed.Â

'The headmistress said "continue cooking and serve the food to the children",' said Police Superintendent Sujeet Kumar.

Soon after the potato curry and rice was served at the school in rural Chappra, Bihar, one of India's poorest states, pupils started complaining of stomach cramps, then began to vomit and collapse.

Ninety minutes later, the first victim died on the way to hospital. Death came so quickly for some that they died in their parents' arms while being taken to hospital.

Dozens of other children are being treated for food poisoning.

Authorities discovered a container of pesticide in the school's cooking area next to the vegetable oil and mustard oil, but it wasn't yet known if that container was the source, said Amarjeet Sinha, a top official in Bihar.

'It's not a case of food poisoning. It's a case of poison in food in a large quantity, going by the instant deaths,' Mr Sinha said.

More answers are expected on Friday, when a forensic laboratory is to issue the results of its tests on the dead children, the food and the uncooked grain stored by the headmistress in her house, he said.

Police were searching for the principal, who fled after the students started falling sick, Sinha said.

The cooks, Manju Devi and Pano Devi, told The Associated Press that the principal controlled the food for the free daily lunch provided by the government at the school.

She gave them rice, potatoes, soy and other ingredients needed to prepare the meal for Tuesday lunchtime and then went about her business. As the children ate, they started fainting, the cooks said.

The two cooks were not spared either.

Local farmer Ajay Kumar's 5-year-old daughter was among the victims. He was in his house, which is about 100 metres from the school, when he heard screams from neighbours saying the children had fallen ill.

'I rushed there and all the kids were on their backs or clutching their stomachs or vomiting. I picked up my girl and took her to the local hospital right away,' Ajay said.

Parents hitched rides or took public transport to get to the hospital, which is about nine miles from the village, he said.

Medical staff told them they had no medicines to give them. His daughter died shortly afterwards, writhing in pain on the floor.

When Reuters visited the village, there were at least 18 burial mounds, many in a large field opposite the school. Some contained multiple bodies and villagers could not agree on how many children were buried in them.

Many parents said they buried their children's toys and clothes in the graves.

Manju Devi, 30, ate some of the food and fainted. Her three children, ages five, eight and 13, fell ill as well. All were in stable condition Thursday.

While Pano Devi, 35, didn't eat the tainted food, her three children did. Two of them died and the third, a four-year-old daughter, was in the hospital.

'I will stop cooking at the school,' she said. 'I am so horrified that I wouldn't grieve more if my only surviving child died.'

Mr Sinha said one of the cooks told authorities that the cooking oil appeared different than usual, but the principal told her to use it anyway.

Doctors treating the children said they suspected the food had been contaminated with insecticide.

Media reports said the cooking oil may have been stored in an old pesticide container, but there was no independent confirmation of this.

'The minute the children were brought in, we smelled this foul odour of organophosphorus,' said Dr. Vinod Mishra, a doctor in the medical team treating many of the children at Patna Medical College Hospital in Bihar's capital, Patna.

Organophosphorus compounds are used as pesticides, which are widely available and are sold under a variety of different brands.

Treatment: The meal was cooked in the school kitchen, but school authorities stopped serving it as children started vomiting

The free midday meal was served to the
 children Tuesday in Gandamal village in Masrakh block, 50 miles north 
of Patna, the Bihar state capital.

Those
 who survived the poison were unlikely to suffer from any serious after 
effects from the tainted food, said Patna Medical College hospital 
superintendent Amarkant Jha Amar.

'There
 will be no remnant effects on them. The effects of poisoning will be 
washed after a certain period of time from the tissues,' Mr Amar said.

He
 said that the post-mortem reports on the children who died confirmed 
that insecticide was either in the food or cooking oil. He said 
authorities were waiting for lab results for more details on the 
chemicals.

India's midday 
meal plan is one of the world's biggest school nutrition programs. State
 governments have the freedom to decide on menus and timings of the 
meals, depending on local conditions and availability of food rations.

It
 was first introduced in the Sixties in southern India, where it was 
seen as an incentive for poor parents to send their children to school.

Since
 then, the program has spread across the country, covering some 
120million schoolchildren. It's part of an effort to address concerns 
about malnutrition, which the government says nearly half of all Indian 
children suffer from.

Although
 there have been complaints about the quality of the food served and the
 lack of hygiene, the incident in Bihar appeared to be unprecedented for
 the massive food program.
