Dressed in a pink tutu with a matching satin hair bow, and surrounded by a mountain of designer baby clothes, it is hard to believe this smiling little girl spent the first weeks of her life fighting for survival in intensive care.

Doctors warned would-be glamour model Charley Bradshaw, 19, to prepare for the worst when her daughter was born with just one lung and one kidney, and with her heart in the wrong place.

But Princess Tiiaana went on to make an incredible recovery, and her thrilled mother has celebrated by splashing out thousands of pounds on a fairytale wardrobe for her 'little miracle', from fur coats and Baby Dior ballet slippers to romper suits designed by her idol Katie Price.

Princess Tiiaana - whose name was inspired by that of Katie Price's daughter Princess Tiaamii - weighed just six pounds when she was born at Warrington Hospital, and doctors suspected the little girl would need surgery on her heart as well as a donor lung and kidney.

But after eight days in intensive care Princess was coping without her missing organs, and stunned doctors concluded she would not need an operation after all.

Now aged nine months, the baby girl is the picture of health and Miss Bradshaw and her boyfriend Michal Majewska, also 19, have been told that while their daughter may be more susceptible to chest and kidney infections, she should go on to lead a normal life.

'I'm so proud of my daughter after what she has endured in her short life, she deserves not only to be given the name Princess but also to be treated like one too,' said her mother, who added that she is 'addicted' to splashing out on designer goodies for her daughter.

'She
is my little miracle and whilst I know I may be spoiling her rotten I 
just cannot believe how blessed we are to have her home after all that 
she has been through,' she said.

Shoe collection: Baby Princess has a separate wardrobe to house her growing shoe and hat collection

At just nine months old Princess Tiiaana already has a wardrobe worthy of her namesake, along with a second to house her growing collection of shoes, which includes Ugg-style baby boots, sparkly trainers and diamante ballet pumps.

'We must have spent hundreds if not thousands of pounds on her buying clothes, shoes, headbands and toys,' full-time mother Miss Bradshaw said.

'She deserves not only to be given the name Princess but also to be treated like one too'

'Her wardrobe is already full to the 
brim with designer goodies - she even has a wardrobe just for her little
shoes and hats. It really is just her her, her, her in our lives. She 
is adorable. She is so smiley and looking at her you would not know 
anything had been wrong with her.

'Baby
things can be expensive anyway but I think we do go overboard with 
spoiling her, and obviously we'll make sure she doesn't get too demanding.

'We are living with my parents so we don't have much outgoings to pay 
for, so we do spend quite a lot on her,' she added.

'We've
spent possibly around £2,000 on clothes, her fur coats can cost from 
£40 upwards and her crystallised shoes cost a fortune, around £80.

'By 
October last year we had already spent nearly £250 on her Christmas 
presents and we didn't stop there. I would say it's like an addiction, I
just can’t stop buying for her,' said the teenager, who estimates she and her boyfriend have spent around £8,000 on their pampered daughter when taking into account essentials like nappies and prams.

And Miss Bradshaw said their spending spree is unlikely to come to an end any time soon, as Princess Tiiaana is already outgrowing her sizeable designer wardrobe.

Dark days: Doctors feared Princess Tiiaana would not survive after she was born with her heart in the wrong place

'We feel so lucky to have her': Princess Tiiaana's mother says her growing girl will soon need a whole new wardrobe

Princess Tiiaana's doting mother had been planning to follow in the footsteps of her idol Katie Price by embarking on a modelling career, and was intending to undergo breast enhancement surgery when she unexpectedly fell pregnant.

When Miss Bradshaw had her second scan, it revealed that Princess Tiiaana's heart was on the wrong side and doctors feared she wouldn't survive.

One theory was that she had a hole in her diaphragm (the sheet of muscle under the ribs), which was causing her organs to be pushed up and to one side, known as congenital diaphragmatic hernia.

This is a life-threatening condition that results in the baby’s abdominal organs moving up into the chest cavity, compressing its lungs and heart.

But a scan after she was born revealed there was no hole - the organs simply weren't there.

Instead, she had pulmonary hypoplasia - her right lung hadn’t developed - and she was also missing a kidney.

But incredibly, she didn’t need surgery.

Miss Bradshaw said: 'Doctors told me her other lung and kidney were good sizes and accounted for the missing ones and she was coping fine.

‘Her heart was a good size and was working normally.

'They were amazed and said then and there she wouldn’t need an operation - and after 10 days we were sent home. I've been told everything is working fine and that there is no need for us to worry.

'The only warning doctors had was that Princess may be more susceptible to chest infections and asthma when she is older.'

But when she and mechanic Michal, her boyfriend of five years, went to find out the gender of their baby, they were given the devastating news that her heart was growing on the wrong side of her body.

The young couple were even given information on termination procedures by doctors who warned the chances of their child surviving were slim.

Miss Bradshaw was referred to Liverpool Women's Hospital for specialist care, but when Princess Tiiaana was born her parents were told her condition was even worse than initially feared.

A scan revealed the little girl had pulmonary hypoplasia, meaning one of her lungs had failed to develop and she was missing a kidney.

'When she was born it was one bombshell blow after another,' said Miss Bradshaw.

'I couldn't think straight and I was thinking the worst. My mind raced and I wondered if it was it my fault. But I'd been so careful, eaten healthily, I didn't drink and I didn't smoke.

'The doctors had told me that if she was strong enough to survive 24 hours by herself then they would want to perform an operation to move her heart but of course there were risks attached. That in itself was a waiting game to see if she'd pull through.'But she fought through and the doctors said the lung and kidney that were present were good sizes and accounted for the missing ones. Because she was missing one from each side they balanced each other.'

Miss Bradshaw said doctors were 'amazed' to observe her daughter's recovery.

'Her
heart was a good size and was pumping blood to the arteries and after 
10 days we were sent home,' she said. 'They were amazed.'

Incredibly, Princess
Tiiaana will never need surgery and doctors have told her proud parents
that they should expect their daughter to grow up to be a healthy 
little girl. 

Now Miss Bradshaw is hoping it is her
daughter who will enjoy a modelling career, and has already sent 
photographs of her adorable little girl to a host of agencies.

'Katie
Price has always been my idol since I was a young teenager and 
obviously she has her little girl Princess Tiaamii so that's why we 
called our daughter Princess Tiiaana.

'I'd love for my Princess to have a lifestyle like Jordan's children have and for her to never do without.

'We want to get her into modelling and have sent pictures off to agencies.'We
just spoil her to bits and we want to give her everything. We never 
thought that she would pull through and we feel so happy to have her.

'It's
amazing, you hear about people who have just one lung or one kidney but
rarely missing both as well as having the heart in the wrong place. We 
feel so lucky, and in our eyes there is nothing holding her back.

'She is our little Princess.'

Then and now: Father Michal, 19, cuddling baby Princess in hospital, left, and the now nine-month-old surrounded by her array of pink dresses and shoes, right

A spokesman for Warrington Hospital said: 'It's great to hear that Princess is doing so well. This is a condition that can be very complex depending on the severity.

'The potential problems were spotted by our antenatal team at the hospital who were able to refer Charley for specialist support she and Princess needed and we are pleased it was picked up at an early stage.'
