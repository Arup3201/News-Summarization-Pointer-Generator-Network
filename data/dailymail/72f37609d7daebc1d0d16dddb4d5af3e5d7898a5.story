A mother and her three children were killed when a small plane she was flying crashed in a field in northwestern France yesterday.

The 39-year-old woman, said to be an experienced flyer, had rented the aircraft from a nearby flying club and was with her two daughters and son, aged 13, 11 and nine.

Pictures taken at the crash site today capture the twisted and broken remains of the aircraft, which went down near a farm in the small town of Vrigny, near Argentan.

The alarm was raised at around 5.30pm after a witness saw the plane falling from the sky and rescue teams discovered the wreckage around 40 minutes later. 

The plane, a Robin DR 400 which belonged to the Argentan flying club, suffered catastrophic damage in the accident and an investigation into the cause of the crash is now underway, reports Corsematin. 

A police spokesman said: 'The alert was given by a witness. The plane was found at 6:10pm in the municipality of Vrigny.'

A local official, Hugues de Phily, told Corsematin: 'I do not know what the trajectory of the plane was. The debris is all over the place.

'It's difficult to say how the plane was going. Mum was in the front.'

Mr de Phily said that flying conditions were good and added that the investigation was being entrusted to the research section of the aviation police, who are at the crash site today.

The mother of the family was believed to be an seasoned flyer, having flown planes for ten years. 

The children's father was in severe shock after hearing the devastating news and was being treated at a hospital in Argentan last night, reports France Bleu.
