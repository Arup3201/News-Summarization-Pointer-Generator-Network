Iceland will start selling lobster, from Canada, for just £5 from next week

Like champagne and caviar, lobster is usually reserved for the most special of occasions.

Now budget supermarket Iceland could make it an everyday luxury by offering the seafood for just £5.

Its lobster, which will go on sale next week, has been imported from Canada.

Ordering the delicacy at speciality London restaurant Burger and Lobster costs more than four times the price at £20.

Iceland will also begin selling ‘hand-dived’ Peruvian scallops for £4, which is the same price as Waitrose.

The supermarket said it was committed to providing families with ‘great quality seafood at Christmas’. 

The spokesman added: ‘Our aim this year is to offer great quality meal solutions for our customers, from simple starters in shells to a side of salmon for the buffet table. The range is accessible to most customers, with prices ranging from £2 to £7, but we haven’t compromised on quality.’

The move comes as budget supermarket chains are increasingly offering items once seen as the preserve of luxury suppliers.

Earlier this year, German chain Aldi secured supplies of Wagyu, the world’s most expensive beef, which it sold at £6.99 for a sirloin steak, or £25 per kilo. Normally the succulent Japanese meat is priced at £100 per kilo.

Food experts have praised Lidl’s £2.65 Best Smoked Salmon, while Aldi was applauded for its £7.99 pheasant for two.

But Aldi came a cropper over its 20g portions of luxury caviar for £9.99. 

The product was originally described as ‘Beluga’ but the name was changed after experts discovered it did not come from the correct species of sturgeon. 

And even though luxury items are becoming increasingly common in supermarkets, there are still many expensive foods which are yet to appear on the high street. 

Swedish moose cheese, for example, will cost you around £187 per pound, while British White Stilton Gold is £262 a pound, or £6 a slice.

France has developed a taste for British food – including chicken tikka masala.

Marks and Spencer’s store on the Champs Elysees now sells more portions of Britain’s favourite curry than any branch in the UK.

In 2005, France’s then-president Jacques Chirac mocked British food, scoffing: ‘You can’t trust people whose cuisine is so bad.’

But the nation is now setting aside its culinary heritage to buy vast quantities of scones and crumpets. Jill Bruce, Marks and Spencer’s head of international food, said they had noticed a big uptake in UK classics since opening branches in France three years ago.

The nation of camembert, brie and Roquefort has even developed a taste for Stilton.

Pret a Manger, another UK brand, is also doing well in France as consumers there want food quickly. Mark Palmer, of Pret, said: ‘There was a demand for high quality food at pace.’
