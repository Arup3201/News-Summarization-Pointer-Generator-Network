The owner of the Houston Rockets basketball team has paid $42 million for a duplex penthouse in New York City's Gramercy Park.

Leslie Alexander’s purchase has made records in real estate prices and represents the highest sale price in downtown Manhattan, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The condo has 6,330 square feet of interior space with five bedrooms and 5½ baths, a library and gallery.

There are four terraces taking up 1,889 square feet of space, one of which faces Gramercy Park with views of the Chrysler building.

The luxury home has an outdoor infinity pool with a sun deck on one terrace and a heated whirlpool on another.

Both terraces open from the master bedroom.

Alexander, 70, who was valued at around $1.2 billion, would have put a down payment of around $8,400,000 on the condo, with a monthly installment of $194,681, including his mortgage, according to the real estate listing on streeteasy.com.

In 2006 it was revealed that Alexander was amongst the 400 richest people in the US.

The 18 Gramercy Park duplex, which is located on the 17th and 18th floors, is a conversion designed by Robert A.M. Stern that set records for condo prices soon after it went on the market last year.

The building, which was a former 
Salvation Army residence for women, was developed by Zeckendorf 
Development and Eyal Ofer Global Holdings.

They
 were two of the development partners of Mr Stern's 15 Central Park 
West, a building that holds current records for the most expensive 
closed condo sale in Manhattan, said the Wall Street Journal.

Alexander,
 a former Wall Street trader from New Jersey, bought the Rockets in July
 1993 and in his first season as owner, the Rockets won their first-ever
 NBA title. They repeated as champs in 1995.

From
 1997 until early 2007, Alexander was the owner of the WNBA's Houston 
Comets. The Comets won the league's first 4 WNBA championships from 1997
 to 2000.

He sold the team to Hilton Koch in January 2007 and the Comets folded a year later.

He was named the best owner in the NBA by Forbes in 2008.

He also owns a vineyard on Long Island and the related company Leslie Wine, launched in 2008. He also has a residence in Houston.

Alexander started trading options and bonds for a Wall Street firm before he broke off to form his own investment company, The Alexander Group, in 1980.

Alexander divorced his wife, Nanci, in 2003 in a secret divorce in which he paid her $150 million.
