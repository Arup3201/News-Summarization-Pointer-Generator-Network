Stevan Jovetic cannot bear to talk about last season’s injury-blighted campaign – but the Manchester City striker is backing himself to prove sceptics wrong this time around.

At £22million, the Montenegrin was labelled one of the flops of the season having returned just three league goals following his move from Fiorentina last summer.

Fitness problems restricted him to only seven starts in all competitions and the suspicion was he would be sold during the close-season.

Sidelined: Manchester City striker Jovetic missed large chunks of last season due to injury

But manager Manuel Pellegrini has publicly backed the 24-year-old and handed him a start during Sunday’s 2-0 win at Newcastle.

The Chilean insists Jovetic has a future with the champions, and the player is determined to come good on that faith.

‘I don’t want to speak about last year,’ he said. ‘I just want to look to the future. I am happy to be here and I know that I am going to be an important player for this club and I am happy to be a part of this team.

‘Of course, I am expecting so much from me this season, I expect to score so many goals.’

Jovetic is set to rotate in attack along with Edin Dzeko, Sergio Aguero and Alvaro Negredo, although he could keep his place for Monday’s visit of Liverpool.

And he added: ‘We have a very good team. There is great competition for places with Edin and Sergio and Alvaro.

‘They are all there and we have to do our best and at the end, who is the best in that moment will play.

‘It was nice to start the first game. I am very happy because I played and we did a good job. Also, Sergio came in and scored. We all did well.

‘We are now looking forward to Liverpool. I can’t wait for it.’
