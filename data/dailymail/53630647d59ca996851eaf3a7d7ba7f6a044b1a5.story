CCTV has revealed the moment a young girl narrowly escaped death as a huge piece of glass was blasted from the side of Ukraine's second-biggest stadium.

The 52,000-seat Donbass Arena was shelled yesterday as fighting raged in Donetsk between pro-Russians and Ukrainian forces, despite both sides agreeing to a ceasefire.

The footage from the city, 50 miles from the Russian border, showed a small figure walking towards the entrance of the stadium and falling to the ground as a blast hit above her head.

Narrow escape: CCTV has revealed the moment a young girl escaped death as a huge piece of glass was blasted from the Donbass Arena in Donetsk. The footage began with her walking to the entrance (above)

Ducking for cover: The girl then fell to the ground as the huge piece of glass - pictured - crashed towards her

Impact: The video shows the debris smashing on the ground just a few feet from the young child's head

Moments later, a huge section of glass around the stadium - which was built five years ago and has hosted Champions League matches - came crashing down around the girl.

Incredibly, the girl did not appear to be seriously injured and was helped to her feet by an adult before the pair ran away, a cloud of debris still in the air.

The unclear figure in the video was identified as a young girl by the Reuters news agency.

Donetsk has become a stronghold for the pro-Russian uprising which has gripped eastern regions of Ukraine, and the Donbass Stadium is one of its biggest landmarks.

Second in size only to Dynamo Kiev's home stadium, it opened in 2009 at a reputed cost of £250million to Shakhtar Donetsk football club owner Rinat Akhmetov.

Aftermath: As a cloud of debris rose into the air an adult could be seen running to help the child to safety

Shock: The girl, dressed in red, is helped to her feet in the footage as the dust settles from the explosion

Under attack: Moments later the pair can be seen running to safety. The shelling came despite a ceasefire in Donetsk, which has been at the centre of the pro-Russian uprising which has killed more than 3,000 people

The venue, which hosted five matches at Euro 2012 and has regularly staged Champions League matches, had already suffered minor shelling in the last two months.

Shakhtar have moved their headquarters from the strife-torn industrial city to the capital Kiev, and home games are being played in the western city of Lviv.

Vadyn Gunko, the Arena's interim executive manager, said on the club's website yesterday: 'As a result of a powerful explosion, the blast wave caused serious damage to the western and eastern parts of the arena.

'A part of the facade glass crashed, a large area of it with critical damage. The inner facilities also were hit. We are assessing the damage at the moment, blocking the dangerous areas.

'We are warning the residents of Donetsk not to approach the stadium under any circumstances as it might be unsafe.'

Damage: A photo after the shelling revealed the size of the huge glass panel which was knocked out of place

Unsafe: Shakhtar Donetsk moved from the stadium as its manager warned residents the building was unsafe

Size: The stadium is the second-biggest in Ukraine, beaten only by Dynamo Kiev's home ground in the capital 

The United Nations says more than 3,500 people have died in fighting since pro-Russian separatists stormed government buildings in eastern cities earlier this year.

Battling has carried on despite a ceasefire being in place since September 5 between the separatists and the Ukrainian government, which has deployed its army in the region.

Many residents have been left without gas or power as the cold Ukrainian winter begins to settle in. 

One, 50-year-old Nikolai Batyshchev, has built an oven in his basement which he powers using firewood.

He told the Reuters news agency today: 'There's no sense in staying in our apartment, the windows have long been shattered. Down there it's warm and quiet, and a tree will last you three days.'
