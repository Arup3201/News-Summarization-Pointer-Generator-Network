Former Wasps star Lawrence Dallaglio says the club’s move to Coventry is ‘fantastic’ and has called on fans to support it.

Dallaglio, who won two European Championships and five Premiership titles with Wasps, says the move had to happen for Wasps to stay competitive, and that true fans will follow their team to the midlands.

The former No 8 says he understands the controversy behind the move, but thinks that it is needed for the club to stay in the top flight.

‘It’s a fantastic move for lots and lots of different reasons,’ Dallaglio told Sportsmail. ‘The club has never been able to invest in the business and the team, in the way that it will be able to now.’

‘The Wasps we’ve known and loved over the last 15-20 years has not been able to thrive in the professional era.

‘They can’t offer the most competitive salaries, they haven’t had the state of the art training facilities that they need, they haven’t had a stadium that they feel really is their home.

‘What this move has done is look to rectify that.’

Many fans have expressed their dismay at the decision to move the club further from London, but Dallaglio says they will see it is for the best.

‘The Wasps supporters I’ve spoken to, want to continue to be able to support Wasps as a Premiership team,’ he continued. ‘Without this move that situation would have been at serious risk.

‘As a player who was part of a team that spent 15, 20 years, getting Wasps to the top, I don’t want to see them drop down in the lower leagues.’

‘If you’re a true supporter you get out and support your team wherever they are, and I’ll certainly be going up to Coventry when I get the opportunity.’
