From his lavish contemporary mansion to the Aston Martin sports car parked outside it, Lottery winner John Noakes is surrounded by the trappings that come with having millions in the bank.

As part of a syndicate of 12 struggling bus drivers who shared a £38million jackpot, Mr Noakes, from Corby, thought all his dreams had come true when their numbers came up a year ago.

But the multi-millionaire, who still lives in the Northamptonshire town with his second wife Jean, has told how the windfall brought with it hardship as well as happiness, adding: 'Sometimes I wish I'd never won.'

'Tough': Former bus driver John Noakes, seen with his wife Jean, said there have been some downsides to scooping a share of a £38million Lottery fortune

The former Bus Driver of the Year, 50, told the Sunday People how the members of the syndicate - who each scooped over £3million - had been beset by problems since their win; from family feuds to health scares.

Mr Noakes told how various troubles forced four of the former colleagues to move out of the Northamptonshire town - with two leaving Britain altogether. He and Jean are now preparing to leave Corby for a new life in Cyprus.

'Becoming multi-millionaires changed our lives – but not all for the good,' said Mr Noakes, who said he recently started smoking again due to stress.

While he is 'glad' he won the money, 'the transition from being broke to rich has been tough', he said.

Pros and cons: Mr Noakes, who has a racing car simulator, left, and a pet parrot, right, at his Corby home, said many of his old friends 'don't want to know' since his Euromillions windfall

The former Stagecoach driver said he has had to learn to keep track of his money to ensure it lasts, and that many of his old friends now 'don't want to know'.

He said he is approached by strangers in the street who ask him for money, and claims his former employers snubbed his offer to help out free of charge during last year's Olympic Games.

Mr Noakes added that it was 'tough' trying to be 'equally fair' to members of his family without upsetting anybody. He and his wife are now planning to start a new life in Cyprus.

The 50-year-old, who quit his £18,000 a year driving job after scooping £3,169,553, insists he hasn't changed a bit since the win, and claims he and wife Jean still shop at Poundland.

His Aston Martin is second-hand, while Mrs Noakes said she still looks for bargains when clothes shopping.

Nonetheless, Mr Noakes' life today is almost unrecognisable from his days of driving buses.

The couple have bought six houses, including their own contemporary mansion complete with tennis court, and four for their children from previous marriages.

Another member of the syndicate, Alex Robertson, 58, is moving to Spain to escape family feuds after the lottery win, according to the report.
