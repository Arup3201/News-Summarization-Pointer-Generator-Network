They are responsible for bringing through some of France's greatest ever players, but AS Cannes are on the verge of going out of business after being banned from national football in France.

Cannes, the club that produced World Cup winners Zinedine Zidane and Patrick Vieira as well as Manchester City full-back Gael Clichy, have just a few days to pay off their debts and stay alive.

The club currently play in the fourth tier of French football but have racked up debts of €2.2million (£1.75m). An anonymous donor has already offered to pay half of that, but the club are still €1million short.

The mayor of Cannes has called on some of their famous ex-players to help out. 

'All we need is ten former players to pay €100k or more and save the club,' said David Lisnard, who has been trying to find a buyer for the cash-strapped club.

As well as academy products Vieira, Zidane and Clichy, Cannes have also had the likes of former Czech Republic striker Jan Koller, ex-Hull forward Kamel Ghilas and current Arsenal coach Boro Primorac on their books in the past. 

The club have also started a social media campaign with the hashtag #SaveASCannes to try and raise support.

Cannes were banned by the DNCG on July 7, French football’s financial watchdog, and the success of any appeal depends on paying off their debts.
