Southampton striker Graziano Pelle has defended ‘dirty’ Diego Costa and claims the Chelsea frontman has to adopt a physical approach to protect himself from Premier League defenders.

Pelle studied Costa’s methods, which have landed the Spanish international in trouble with the FA, while learning his trade in Holland.

Italian Pelle will employ some of those techniques when Ronald Koeman’s Champions League hopefuls tackle Swansea on Sunday.

Pelle, 29, said: “When I was playing in Feyenoord Joris Mathijsen was our defender. He had played for Malaga and he said ‘Graziano, Diego Costa is a good player but he is a ‘asesino’ - an assassin. He is really and you are not’.

“He told me that three years ago. Now when I see Costa play I can see.

“You have to be aware, kick before you receive. Every game I go off the field with my ankle bruised. England is like this. If you don’t give, you will receive 100 per cent.

“He plays in a dirty way, but this is the way he plays. I don’t like it if you give an elbow - from the defender or from the striker.

“Defenders always do it and you don’t see the defender criticised. It’s because they are a defender and the striker shouldn’t do it?

“It’s like me, every game I get pushed. I don’t have to say to the referee ‘Oh, I got pushed’. It is better next time I will be stronger.

“I know that I have to protect myself and be strong, but I don’t like it when anyone does something to injure a player.

“I have watched Costa a lot. He is a good player.

“I know his story in football. He was away on loan, then he got injured, then he start to play and scored so many goals. But when I see how he plays, he is a very good striker. “

Pelle is dreaming of emulating bad boy Costa by leading an unfashionable club into the Champions League.

Costa was part of the Atletico Madrid side who won La Liga last season and lost narrowly to Real Madrid in the European final.

Pelle, whose goals have helped fire Southampton to an unlikely top fourth berth, said: “We believe in our quality and we want to continue what we are doing.

“There are many teams like Tottenham, Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool and West Ham all competing for the Champions League.

I really wish that at the end of this season it will be good for us.

“If you see what Atletico Madrid did last year, they have really good players but you can see that money is not everything.

“It’s about the way you play, we enjoy the way we play football. We believe in our squad, but I cannot say now that we will be third. It is small details that can make the difference.”
