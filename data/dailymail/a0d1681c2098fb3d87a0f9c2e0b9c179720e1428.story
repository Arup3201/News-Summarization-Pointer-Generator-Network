A night at the opera has traditionally provided an opportunity to dress up, with men wearing dinner jackets and women opting for formal gowns.

But the English National Opera (ENO) is scrapping its dress code for a series of performances aimed at attracting new audiences.

Spectators coming for the first time will be encouraged to wear casual clothes, such as jeans and trainers, and cocktails are to be served from 'club-style' bars.

The Undress for the Opera scheme has been supported by Blur singer Damon Albarn and Monty Python star Terry Gilliam.

ENO
 artistic director James Berry said he wanted to build on the success of
 Albarn's Doctor Dee show which attracted a new audience to the venue.

He
 added: 'In a sense, Undress For The Opera, this new audience 
initiative, was really inspired by Doctor Dee and seeing a completely 
different audience in this magnificent theatre was so heart-warming.'

Mr
 Berry said that 30 per cent of the ENO's audience was under 44 and they
 wanted to raise that to 40 per cent in the next 12 to 18 months.

The plan includes a series of informal evening shows which will have no dress code and a 'more relaxed' atmosphere.

Prices for the best seats will be held at Â£25 and the audience will have an introduction to the show, be able to download a synopsis of the opera, and be invited to a post-performance party with cast and company members.

Albarn, who admitted to a 'struggle with the word opera', compared its reputation to world music.

He said: 'We are carrying into this century ideas that belonged to a previous generation and really it's just a case of clarifying what the state of play is now and it's quite clearly different and the more that word is spread the easier it will be to translate and bring in new ideas.'

Gilliam, who is appearing in a short film guide to opera, said there was a perception it was an 'art for the rich, the successful and almost dead'.

Rufus
 Norris, Albarn's collaborator on Doctor Dee, told the Daily Telegraph 
that the word 'opera' carried negative connotations for younger 
audiences but had much to offer.

He said: 'The big difference between opera and a gig or a festival is a simple technical one - it's not amplified.

'You have a huge, live, acoustic musical experience with a story at its centre, and it's immensely powerful.

'There's something about the process which gives you a communion with what's happening on the stage.'

One of the informal nights will be a performance of Sunken Garden, based on a story by novelist David Mitchell.

Mr Berry said the show would feature stage performance and 3D film footage.

Mitchell, whose novel Cloud Atlas has been filmed with Tom Hanks and Hugh Grant, teamed up with Dutch composer Michel van der Aa for the production.
