 A far cry from the relative safety of a modern boxing ring, these stunning photos show the brutal West African sport of Dambe, and look like something out of Fight Club.

The gloves are well and truly off here - instead, the contestants' stronger hands are wrapped in hard rope - which in the old days could even be dipped in resin and shards of broken glass.

That practice is now illegal, but the sport is dangerous enough without it - the aim is to strike your opponent with kicks and punches, trying to make them fall to the floor.

Knocking someone down in Dambe is known as 'killing' -  the sport is traditionally practised as training for war, and shares much of the same terminology.

Dambe belongs to the Hausa people. It is centuries old, but is still very popular in Nigeria, southern Niger and the south west of Chad.

The tradition is entrenched among butcher caste groups and is very heavily focussed on communities.The sport started from clans of butchers travelling to different villages at harvest and fighting those from the area as part of the festival entertainment.

Butchers come from a lower caste of Hausa society - they are the only ones who could ritually slaughter animals and handle meat. They would form teams from the village - known as armies - and challenge men from other butchers guilds, as well locals from the audience.

Stand off: Two fighters scout each other out, looking for an opening to make the first move and try and achieve a 'killing' - the name for a take-down

Clubbed: Two younger fighters battle it out in the sandy arena, as one is caught on the back by a swinging arm, but avoids a killer shot

Watching on: Dambe is a very popular spectator sport, and those who come to watch bet on the outcome and chant support or taunts at the fighters

Chowing down: A fighter is caught in the mouth by a flailing arm but has his opponent on the ropes and falling to the ground with a strong head-shot

Nowadays, that sense of team is still very strong, and the sport is still dominated by the butchers caste, but competitors will often be very young - teenagers who train in gyms and yards - and will fight all year round.

Fighters join a professional community which travel to fight, often now in temporary rings, rather than just inside a circle of spectators as in the past. They fight for prize money - just as they did traditionally - as harvest was a time of wealth.

They wear shorts, rather than loincloths, and the pre-fight entertainment is more elaborate, and can even use sound systems.

The fights in these pictures, taken in Nigeria, took place inside a sand-filled arena, which can be found in larger towns and are also used for wrestling championships. 

Team spirit: Dambe is traditionally a sport where fighters travel in teams, challenging people from other villages, and this is still the case today

Poised to strike: Two youngsters, one a left-hander, look to make the first move and get the upper hand in the bout

The gloves are off: The fighters do not wear gloves, but instead wrap their stronger hand with rope - which they once could dip in resin and shards of glass

Dambe used to include an element of wrestling, known as Kokawa, but is now essentially about punching and kicking.

Fights last three rounds - though these rounds are not timed - their end is signified either when there is a lull in the action, one of the contestants or an official calls a stop to it, or when someone is knocked down. 

There are no official weight classes, though fighters are normally matched up with someone of a similar size. 

The strapped up strong arm is knows as the 'spear', while the front hand is called the 'shield' - and must be held with the palm open and facing the opponent. As well as for protection, the shield can also be used to grab hold of an opponent.

Contestants can also kick with both legs - the lead leg can sometimes be wrapped with a chain and is also used for defence.

Spectators are a key part of the whole event - they create the atmosphere by chanting to support or taunt the competitors, while betting is also prevalent.

Other traditions include the use of amulets for supernatural protection, with some fighters wrapping them to their spear hand, while some of the fighting groups also ritually smoke marijuana before matches.

Time to relax: A fighter spits water into the air and lets it fall back over his face to cool down after a brutal battle
