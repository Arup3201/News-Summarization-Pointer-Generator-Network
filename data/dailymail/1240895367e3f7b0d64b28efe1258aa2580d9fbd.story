Hundreds of grieving relatives, friends and sympathetic strangers came together Saturday for a funeral marking the tragic end of a three-month search for a missing autistic New York City teen.

The former Roman Catholic archbishop of New York, Cardinal Edward Egan, presided over the ceremony at the Church of Saint Joseph as 14-year-old Avonte Oquendo's parents and brothers sat stoically in a front pew, next to a white casket holding the remains pulled from the East River last week.

‘This morning we are grateful to God for Avonte Oquendo, for his life, for his courage, and for the acts of goodness and kindness that his life and his tragic disappearance evoked among us,’ Egan said.

‘We know that he is safely in the embrace of the father in heaven and we thank that father in heaven for the years we had with him in our midst.’

River of tears: Weeping family and other attendees of Avonte's funeral lay flowers over his casket at it is prepared to leave for the burial

Oquendo, who had a form of autism that made him nonverbal, had been missing since October 4, when he walked out of his school toward a park overlooking the river.

His remains were found about 11 miles from where he vanished after a massive citywide search that included extensive searches of subway tunnels and regular announcements over the PA system at subway stations.

Many of the volunteers who handed out flyers with his picture on them and helped the search effort arrived at the church Saturday to pay their respects.

Osmaira Maldonado, 28, attended the funeral with her four-year-old son Justin Hardy and introduced herself to Avonte's mother, Vanessa Fontaine, after the service to pass along her condolences.

Act of charity: Greenwich Village Funeral Home covered the costs of the service and a family-only wake

‘I guess it's just a mother thing,’ she said tearfully outside the church. ‘It's so tragic I didn't know what else to say.’

A
 funeral home covered the costs of the service and a family-only wake 
beforehand, where about a hundred relatives sat together in a room full 
of white flowers watching a slideshow of the teen's photos.

‘Nobody
 really wanted to speak,’ said Roberto Colon, 49, whose wife's cousin is
 Avonte's mother. ‘We couldn't fathom what to say.’

Vanessa Fontaine wept through the entire service, and neither she nor Avonte's other relatives spoke.

'It was like complete silence, it was very sad,' family friend Leslie Burch told the New York Daily News.

Actress
 and one-time Celebrity Apprentice star Holly Robinson Peete, who has an
 autistic child of her own, flew out to New York City from California to
 attend Avotne's funeral.

'Headed to NYC to celebrate the life of another angel,' she tweeted to her 400,000 followers hours before the service.

Investigators are still trying to determine how Avonte died and further tests are needed to determine the cause and manner of death, officials have said.

The family's lawyer, David Perecman, filed a notice of claim in October, the first step in suing the city, and has publically listed a number of mistakes he alleges contributed to the boy's disappearance and what he has described as a flawed search effort.

The city's law department has called the boy's death a tragedy and said its attorneys will review a lawsuit when it's filed.

Heartbreaking task: An NYPD dive unit searches for Avonte's remains after an arm and legs were discovered along a rocky shoreline in Queens January 17

Case solved: The child's remains, including a skull, were found about 11 miles from where he vanished

Margaret Coaxume, who didn't know Avonte or his family, brought her 15-year-old autistic son Elijah Thompson to the funeral because, she said, like so many she had closely followed the heartbreaking story of Avonte's disappearance and death.

‘It's a tragedy,’ she said, as mourners placed white roses on the casket inside a hearse that was to take Avonte's body to a crematorium after the service. ‘My heart is heavy.'
