A 24-year-old salon manager was shot dead in the parking lot in front of her business, apparently at random, in what police are calling a mystifying murder.

Authorizes said that the gunman, identified as Tyrone Leeon Smith, 38, took his two young children from a baby sitter's home at gunpoint Tuesday afternoon, then shot dead Cost Cutters manager Amanda Connors before killing himself inside the hair salon.

After a brief standoff, Smith released the children and four employees — one of whom was the children's mother — after entering the Cost Cutters salon that sits in a strip mall along Sioux Falls' busiest street about 1:30 pm, according to authorities.

The employees reported hearing a gunshot as they were leaving the building, Police Sgt Loren McManus told the Associated Press.

Sgt McManus said it didn't appear that Smith wanted to hold the employees or the children hostage, but officers already had discovered Cost Cutters’ manager Amanda Connors inside her red sedan, dead from a gunshot wound.

McManus said he wasn't sure what Connors' relationship was to Tyrone Smith, other than being a co-worker of his children's mother.

Court records show Smith was released from the Minnehaha County Jail on Monday after pleading not guilty to a domestic assault charge against the mother, who was in the salon, the Argus Leader reported.

The mother had taken out a protection order against Smith Monday morning, asking that he be barred from coming within 500 feet of her, their children, their shared home or the day care their children attended.

Connors, who was in her early 20s, was 'absolutely a sweetheart. She could light up a room,' said friend Jarod Smith. He told The Associated Press that he met Ms Connors about three years ago, when the two worked at a Sioux Falls restaurant.

'She was very personable and someone you could talk to about everything and anything,' added Smith, who is not related to the suspect.

Tuesday's tragic chain of events began shortly after 1pm, when police said Smith showed up at the home of his children's baby sitter and took the children by gunpoint.

About five minutes after the baby sitter called authorities, police received a call about a car accident about two miles away in the salon parking lot.

Shortly after that, police got another call, this time about a man holding women and children hostage in the salon. Businesses around the salon were evacuated and a nearby middle- and high-school complex was locked down for hours.

The standoff lasted until nearly 4pm, when a SWAT team that entered the building and discovered Smith had died from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, McManus said.

Retiree Ron Goergen, 56, said he was shopping in the plaza's thrift store when a store manager told shoppers to leave immediately.

And Gene Luke had just finished lunch at a pizza place and was walking to his car when officers swarmed in, preventing him from leaving the parking lot.

'They just said, 'Keep walking,' ' said Mr Luke, 44.

Mr Luke said when he was walking, he saw two kids being carried out of the salon by some women.

Police said the children were unharmed, taken into police custody and later released to their mother.
