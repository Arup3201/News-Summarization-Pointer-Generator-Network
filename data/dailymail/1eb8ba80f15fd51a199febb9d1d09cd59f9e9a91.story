World leaders joined thousands of people to pay their final respects to Singapore's 'founding father' Lee Kuan Yew.

Crowds of Singaporeans waving flags braved heavy rain and lined the streets to catch a last glimpse of Lee as his coffin was taken on a 15km (nine mile) procession on top of a gun carriage.

Leader of the House of Commons William Hague, former U.S. President Bill Clinton and Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe attended the three-hour state funeral alongside 2,200 other people including children and royalty.

Lee, who died aged 91 on Monday, ruled for for three decades as Singapore's first prime minister.

He is credited with transforming the country from a small, colonial British trading port into one of the world's wealthiest city states.

His death has prompted an unprecedented show of mourning. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Lee's son, battled tears as he delivered a 40-minute eulogy in English, Malay and Chinese.

He said: 'The light that has guided us all these years has been extinguished.

'His was the original Singapore Roar - passionate, formidable and indomitable.

'To those who seek Mr Lee Kuan Yew's monument, Singaporeans can reply proudly: "Look around you."'

Thousands of people gathered to see a 21-gun salute in the city's business district as the procession passed by

Members of the public saluted the casket, which was covered in a flag, and shouted 'Lee Kuan Yew' 

Public warning sirens sounded across the country to mark a minute's silence, with buses and trains coming to a halt.

Booms from a 21-gun salute reverberated around the city's business district as four F-16 fighter jets from the Black Knights aerobatic team flew overhead in a 'missing man' formation.

The salute is normally reserved for sitting heads of state but an exception was made for Lee.

Two navy ships near the marina also made an 'L' 'K' 'Y' signal with their flags.

Singaporeans, many dressed in the mourning colours of black and white, waited for hours to watch the procession, shouting 'Lee Kuan Yew' as it passed. Others simply wept or threw flowers. 

Huang Jiancong was standing at the start of the route carrying a Singapore flag.

His body was transferred atop a gun carriage and was followed by multiple vans, vehicles and motorbikes

Grieving residents even sat on the wet floor under umbrellas as they waited for the casket to pass them

Commercial activity in the country slowed for the ceremony as police tried to keep people off the roads

The 54-year-old said: 'His biggest achievement was to help elevate living standards.'

Jennie Yeo, a teacher who arrived at 7am, said: 'He did everything for us Singaporeans regardless of race, language or religion. 

'Education, housing, everything you can think of, he’s taken care of for us.' 

Singapore now has one of the world’s highest GDP per capita incomes at $56,284 (£37,839) in 2014, up from a mere $516 (£346) when it gained independence.

Ninety per cent of Singaporeans own their homes, thanks to a public housing scheme launched by Lee, and the country enjoys one of the world’s lowest crime rates.

Lee's influence on the international stage  was reflected in the funeral's turnout of serving and former leaders from across the globe.

A minute of silence is observed during the state funeral. The casket was surrounded by beautiful flowers 

Vice President Li Yuanchao represented China while ex-secretary of state Henry Kissinger, a close friend of Lee's, came for the United States alongside Clinton.  

Lee's death was less than five months before the city-state's 50th anniversary of independence.

Almost 500,000 went to see Lee lying in state over the past four days, many queuing in the tropical sun for up to 10 hours to pay their final respects. 

More than a million people have visited condolence sites set up at community centres across the country. 

Commercial activity in the country  slowed for the ceremony, with many shops and the country's two large casinos closing.

Screens along Orchard Road, the main shopping street, all showed the ceremony.

Hundreds of officials in white and black uniforms also marched alongside the casket despite getting soaking wet

Tan Soon Wah, 60, said: 'I saw Singapore change from nothing to today. I hope Singapore will carry on without Mr Lee.'

London-based author Salil Tripathi, who was a foreign correspondent in Singapore in the 1990s, said: 'His sharp intellect gave him the aura of an elder statesman, allowing his admirers at home and abroad to overlook more complicated facts about him, including how political opponents were treated.' 

The sombre mood extended beyond Singapore, with India and New Zealand also observing an official day of mourning on Sunday.

Lee's body will be cremated in a private ceremony for his family later today.
