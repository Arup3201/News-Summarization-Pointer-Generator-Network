Trooper Stephen Limani, a state police spokesman, said in a Sunday news release sent to Daily Mail Online on Monday that 'Preliminary reports would indicate no signs of foul play. Toxicology reports are still pending.'

Limani also said that on Saturday, 'A search near [Wilkinson's] vehicle was conducted but turned up negative.'

Saint Vincent College in Latrobe is a private Catholic school that has about 2,000 students.

The school's president Brother Norman Hipps said in a statement to WTAE 'The entire Saint Vincent community is mourning the loss of Laura, who was a 2002 graduate of the College. Laura taught chemistry labs for the Herbert W. Boyer School of Natural Sciences, Mathematics and Computing, where she had worked for approximately 10 years.

'We are sending our prayers and offering any assistance we can to her husband, Jay, and to their family.

'Campus ministers and counseling staff are available to members of the campus community, as are residence life staff. Plans are being made for a memorial service, and arrangements will be shared with the community as soon as they are available to allow students, faculty and staff to support her family and friends in their loss.'
