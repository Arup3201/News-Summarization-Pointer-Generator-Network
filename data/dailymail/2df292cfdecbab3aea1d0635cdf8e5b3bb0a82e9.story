Nick Clegg was accused of hypocrisy yesterday after it emerged that his team of political advisers has ballooned from three to 14 at a cost to the taxpayer of £900,000 a year.

The figure represents the lion’s share of the £1.3million annual bill for the 21 Liberal Democrat special advisers.

Details of the increase, which is another breach of a manifesto promise, were slipped out in a Downing Street statement as MPs broke up for their 47-day summer recess.

Unpopular: Clegg's approval rating has reached a new low of minus 59, down from a heady plus 53 in the halcyon days of May 2010 when the Coalition was formed

In Opposition Mr Clegg pledged that a Lib Dem government would never burden the taxpayer with the bill for special advisers, nicknamed spads.

In September 2009, in a policy document A Better Politics for Less, he pledged: ‘The [Labour] government employs 74 special advisers, an increase of 90 per cent since 1995, at a cost to the taxpayer of £5.9million each year.

‘These are political jobs and therefore should be funded by political parties. Special advisers will not be paid for by the taxpayer.’

But now he is in government, the Deputy Prime Minister has abandoned the commitment to slashing Whitehall’s ‘Spadocracy’.

He had three political advisers when the Coalition began, now there are 14. The cost of his private office has soared by 200 per cent in a year at a time when he is demanding deep cuts in public spending.

   The highest paid adviser is Jonathan Oates, Mr Clegg’s chief of staff, whose £98,000 salary comfortably tops the £89,000 paid to junior ministers.

Three other advisers are paid £80,000 a year, including Neil Sherlock, a millionaire accountant who has donated £88,000 to Lib Dem funds.

He is the Lib Dems’ first director of government relations. His former employer, City giant KPMG, already earns vast sums from Government accounting contracts.

Julia Goldsworthy, special adviser to Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, is paid £74,000.

Until her defeat at the last election she was Liberal Democrat MP for Falmouth and Camborne, with a salary of £65,738 – so she has received an £8,000 pay rise from public funds since losing her seat.

The rest are paid an average of £64,500 – only slightly less than the £65,750 paid to MPs.

Labour accused Mr Clegg of double standards. Jon Trickett, shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, said: ‘Even from a man who is used to breaking promises, this is total hypocrisy from Nick Clegg and the Lib Dems.

‘His party used to say special advisers shouldn’t be funded by the taxpayer but now, as this shambolic government lurches from crisis to crisis he’s attempting to shore himself up with a raft of new political appointees paid for by the public. You can’t believe a word he says.

‘Neil Sherlock should not be rewarded for his donations to the Liberal Democrats with a publicly funded job.’

Some of the Lib Dem advisers are monitoring the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Defence, and the education and health departments, which are all run by Tory Cabinet ministers.

Yet the spending spree, which is designed to burnish the Lib Dems’ battered image, has done nothing to halt the slide in Mr Clegg’s approval ratings.

The most recent YouGov poll found that Mr Clegg’s approval rating had reached a new low of minus 59, down from a heady plus 53 in the halcyon days of May 2010 when the Coalition was formed.

A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘They do not work directly for the party, they work for Lib Dem ministers in the government.’

David Cameron is also under fire from his own MPs for reneging on his pledge to cut the number of staff on the Downing Street payroll.

In a speech in September 2009, he said: ‘If we are going to take our country through these difficult times those who lead must lead by powerful example. That means getting our own house in order and cutting the cost of politics.’

The Coalition agreement, published in May 2010, promised to introduce a limit on the number of special advisers.

The number has now reached 81 – one more than under Gordon Brown. The total salary bill is £6.2million, up 30 per cent on the £4.8million in the first year of government. The bulk of the rise is accounted for by the increase in Lib Dem advisers.

Mr Cameron has 19 special advisers including Andrew Cooper, his personal pollster, and Craig Oliver, the director of communications, who are both paid £140,000.

Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley, said: ‘The more advisers this government recruits the bigger the mess it seems to make of things.

‘What is the point of them? If they were experts in policy the cost might just be acceptable. But they are not.

‘Most of them look no more than 15 years old and seem more suited to making the tea than advising senior Cabinet ministers.’
