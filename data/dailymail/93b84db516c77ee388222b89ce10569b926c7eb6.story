Chris Algieri was comprehensively beaten by Manny Pacquiao in Macau. So one sided was the fight that one of the judges had the Filipino star winning all 12 rounds and winning the fight 120-102.

But it seems not everyone saw it that way, Algieri's team kept telling their fighter that he was on top in the fight.

The delusional state of Team Algieri is revealed by quotes from his old kick-boxing now world- title- boxing trainer, Tim Lane, overheard in the corner between rounds: 

Chris Algieri was knocked down six times during his defeat by Manny Pacquiao but his trainer remained positive

Algieri is spoken to by his team - including trainer Tim Lane - at the end of the fifth round 

Algieri shows Pacquiao respect after their fight in which he was comprehensively beaten 

VIDEO Pacquiao delighted with performance 

End of round three, after first knock downs: ‘You’re doing beautiful man. Keep it up.’

End of round seven, following another knock-down: ‘This is where we want to be.’

During round nine, seconds before the heaviest knock down: ‘Chris is going to put him to sleep in a few minutes.’

End of round nine: ‘We are exactly where we need to be.’ (Presumably flat on his back.)

End of round 10: ‘Chris, I’m letting you out of the cage.’ 

End of round 11, at 17 points behind with one round to go: ‘Hit him in the body and stay on his ass. This is The Chris Algieri Show.’
