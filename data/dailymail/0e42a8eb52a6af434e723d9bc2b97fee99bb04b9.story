With their blonde good looks and strapping build, Danish men such as Game of Thrones star Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, 43, have long been considered among the most handsome in Europe.

But women don't just want to date them: They want to have 'Viking babies' too, with Danish sperm now accounting for a third of the total used by British fertility clinics.

And the UK isn't the only place where Danish sperm sales are booming - women from all over the world are choosing to go Scandinavian when they need a sperm donor.

In demand: More and more British women are giving birth to 'Viking babies' helped by Danish sperm banks

Main attraction: Like Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, the Danes' blonde good looks have proved popular

'I went to a conference where someone from the Nordic Ethics Committee showed a slide,' chuckles  Anne Mette Arndal-Lauritzen, who heads the Copenhagen-based European Sperm Bank.

'He said: "These are the main Danish export products - beer, Lego and sperm!"'

So why are so many British women going Danish? According to Dr Alan Pacey, a fertility expert at the University of Sheffield, one of the reasons is a shortage of homegrown sperm.

'We don't have enough donors in the UK to
 meet the national need,' he explains. 'We 
don't have the clinic infrastructure sufficient to recruit enough 
donors - even when men want to donate.

'Often there simply isn't the size
 and scale within small NHS clinics to consider having a donor 
recruitment programme - plus if you're not confident that sufficient men 
are going to ring up and become sperm donors, the economics of it simply
 aren't going to work. 

'The NHS is used to treating patients and you get a
 fee for treating patients. You don't get a fee for screening a donor 
that you may not ultimately accept.'

Compounding
 the problem for British clinics is the 2005 law that forces men to 
waive their anonymity, meaning sperm donors face the prospect of 
offspring turning up on their doorstep once they reach the age of 18.

Nevertheless, although Danish clinics, 
among them the world's largest sperm bank, Cryos, cannot sell semen from
 anonymous donors to British women, business is booming thanks to the 
huge numbers of local men happy to sign up anyway.

While controversies for Danish sperm banks are few and far between, one of the more amusing concerned a bumper crop of sperm sourced from red-headed men.

When, in September 2011, Copenhagen's largest sperm bank Cryos announced it had stopped accepting ginger sperm, the world's flame-haired community was outraged.

Cryos then followed up with an unusual special offer for Scottish parents - a 15 per cent discount for those who plumped for red.

Speaking to the Scottish Sun, director Ole Schou said: 'We would be more than happy to supply to people in Scotland who are looking for a child with red hair.

'We currently have too many donors for the first time ever and I know red hair is particularly popular in places like Scotland and Ireland.

'We are always open to negotiation. Scottish clinics could get a discount of five, 10 or 15 per cent.'

'My parents think its a bit weird,' admits twenty-something donor John, who has waived his anonymity and is responsible for some of the sperm dispatched to UK clinics.

'My father has said a few times: "What am I going to do in 20 years when somebody comes knocking on my door and says Grandpa!"

'I've spoken to them and said that it's not likely to happen, and if it does happen, it's not a bad situation. It might be a good thing.'

Like other Danish donors, he is a regular visitor to the European Sperm Bank, which, according to its boss, does well because it focuses purely on semen.

'This is the only thing we do,' explains Arndal-Lauritzen. 'We don't 
do eggs, we don't do anything else. We just do sperm and sperm donation 
and that allows us to focus on what we do.'

Although the prospect of cash payments is an incentive for some, other donors say its the prospect of helping childless families conceive that brings them to Arndal-Lauritzen's door.

'I 
haven't got a lot of money and I need it,' explains John. 'But I think I would be
 10 times more happy about doing this if I could see some kind of 
reaction, some kind of pay-off in the happiness of these people.

'It's
 a good purpose and it helps people who cannot have children. Instead of
 donating blood, you could do this instead and make people happy.'

'It would be nice if there were 100, 200 
children that are half me,' chuckles fellow donor Adam, a married professional in his late 30s. 'I think it's funny to think about how many
 children I can make.'

But availability isn't the only reason so many British women want to bear a half-Danish child. For many, the Danes' handsome blue-eyed, blonde looks and 'dependable natures' are just as attractive.

'The blonde hair and the blue eyes 
appeal,' laughs one mother who conceived with the help of a Danish 
clinic. 'The cheekbones as well I think!'

Choice: Denmark's sperm banks, among them Cryos, deploy excellent customer service to help boost sales

Experts such as Laura Witjens, CEO of the National Gamete Donation Trust, say the excellent customer service deployed by Copenhagen's sperm banks has also contributed to the Viking baby boom.

'It's much easier for a British clinic to
 order sperm from Denmark which is Fed-exed the next day than to 
try and recruit their own donors and all the hassle that goes with them,' says Witjens.

'The
 Danish model is customer service driven. It knows how to deal well with
 customers, it has a good website, and that's what we could do in the UK 
as well - it's not rocket science.'

'Denmark is geographically close to the 
UK,' adds Dr Pacey. 'I think there's some sort of philosophical and intellectual bond 
that we have with Denmark.'

Jo, a British woman who became mother to a son, Euan, with her partner Sarah, agrees and says she plans to teach her little boy about his Danish heritage when the time comes.

'For Sarah and I, it will be very 
important to explain things to Euan, to take him to Denmark and to show 
him the Viking boats,' she explains.

'It's part of who he is so we have to explain to 
him about that, to educate him about that. I was actually in Denmark a 
couple of weeks ago and I brought him back a little Viking hat to 
celebrate his Vikingness. I don't think he was too impressed in the 
beginning but then he got used to it!'

'It's a bit like the Viking invasion of 800 AD,' adds an amused Dr Pacey. 'They've invaded us once by boat and now they're doing it by sperm!'

Needless to say, the Danish donors and sperm banks behind the influx of Scandinavian semen see it slightly differently.

'I feel quite international,' comments Adam. 'The 
international father!' But, he adds, 'We're just helping you [British mothers].

'I'm not thinking about the
 Vikings,' he continues. 'I think [sperm donations] could be a great help for you in the UK and that's 
very good.'
