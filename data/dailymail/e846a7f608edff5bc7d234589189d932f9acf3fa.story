Three people, including a volunteer firefighter who was sitting inside on his computer, have been struck by lightning during a wild storm that has swept across Perth. 

It's believed the volunteer in his 30s, who works at Rockingham Fire Station, was at home when a lightning strike hit his house at about 8.30am today. 

'He reported that he wasn't feeling well, it could have been residual shocks and he was taken to Rockingham hospital,' said a St John Ambulance Australia spokesman.

It's believed the man was taken to hospital for treatment and was suffering shock and a 'little anxiety' more than anything, according to another fire volunteer.

A lightning strike at City Beach in Perth on Monday caused its closure that morning

Thunderstorms hit the storm early morning, bringing with it numerous lightning strikes in the metropolitan area

Two other people, a man and a woman, are also lucky to be alive when a tree they were standing underneath, at Hammond Park, south of Perth, were struck by lightning about 9am. 

'They were knocked back by the force and we got to them and we transported them to the Royal Perth hospital with minor injuries,' said the ambulance spokesperson.

A neighbour told the West Australian that the lightning bolt hit a tree and then hit the man in the chest, knocking him to the ground.

It was reported that he was 'incoherent and lying on the grass in front of the house' after he had been hit. 

Thunderstorms hit the storm early morning, bringing with it numerous lightning strikes in the metropolitan area.

A Department of Fire and Emergency Service spokesman said they attended a couple of reported lightning strike incidents but there was no excessive damage at either of them.

'The power went out but it was quickly restored,' he said.

'We attended a few fires east of Albany as a result of lightning strikes but we have come through relatively unscathed.'

'We are attending those fires now, they are relatively small and the bad weather has now passed through, it's overcast and there's a bit of rain,' he said. 

Surf Life Saving Western Australia reported the City beach and Secret Harbour were closed due to lightning strikes this morning.

They warned people to get off the beach and out of the water during lightning, but they have now been re-opened.

Weatherzone meteorologist Ben McBurney said the storm had been caused by the crossing of a low pressure trough.

'Combined warm and moist air created the thunderstorm, there was not a lot of rain, around two to five millimetres but there was a fair bit of lightning he said.

He said the storms in Perth had passed through and the chance of another storm now was pretty low.

'The trough has moved east of Perth, with the high pressure ridge coming in which is associated with more stable weather.'

The city forecast is looking a lot milder through the week with a bit of a cold front moving through overnight.

'The frontal system will clip Perth and there should be light showers tomorrow morning but there should be no storms in the near future.'

'The next chance of a storm is Saturday,' he said.

With the temperature in Perth soaring to 38 degrees yesterday, today cooled down to a mild 24 degrees as the storm passed.

A Department of Fire and Emergency Service says while they are quiet for now they will be keeping an eye on the roads which are expected to get slippery with a bit of rain.
