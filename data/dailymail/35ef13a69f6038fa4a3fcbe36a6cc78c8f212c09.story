Months after the death of the Mars rover Spirit, its surviving twin is poised to reach the rim of a vast crater to begin a fresh round of exploration.

Driving commands sent up to Opportunity directed the six-wheel rover to make the final push towards Endeavour crater, a 14mile-wide depression near the Martian equator that likely could be its final destination.

At its current pace and barring any hiccups, Opportunity should roll up to the crater's edge any day now.

Slowly but surely: Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity makes its way to its destination - the Red Planet's vast Endeavour crater - in this image taken last month. It is due to arrive at the equator site any day now

The journey, which took nearly three years culminated on Tuesday when Opportunity signalled it had arrived at the location dubbed Spirit Point in honour of the rover's twin, which fell silent last year

The finish line was a spot along a ridge that the rover team nicknamed Spirit Point in honour of Opportunity's lost twin.

Scientist Ray Arvidson, of Washington
 University in St Louis, who is part of the team, said: 'I'm totally 
pumped. We've been driving for so long.'

The
 milestone injects a sense of adventure back into a mission that wowed 
the public with colour portraits of the landscape and the unmistakable 
geologic discoveries of a warm and wetter past.

The
 Nasa rovers parachuted to opposite sides of Mars in 2004 for what was a
 planned three-month mission, but both have operated way beyond 
expectations.

Almost there: Opportunity used its panoramic camera to capture this view of a portion of Endeavour crater's rim last week after a drive during the rover's 2,676th day of working on Mars

Spirit's 
journey ended in May after Nasa ceased trying to contact it. It had been
 trapped in sand and unheard from for more than a year.

Opportunity
 has been on a driving spree since 2008 after it crawled out of a much 
smaller crater and trundled south toward Endeavour, stopping 
occasionally to sightsee and examine rock outcrops.

Unlike
 the early days of the mission when the public tracked Opportunity's 
every move, the march to Endeavour has been largely low-key.

In
 early 2009, Opportunity caught its first peek of the uplifted rim on 
the horizon. At the time, scientists were unsure if the rover would make
 it all the way.

The roughly seven-mile journey took longer than the estimated two years to fulfil.

Opportunity,
 driving backwards to prevent its right front wheel from wearing out, 
could not travel as the crow flies because of dangerous obstacles. So it
 took a circuitous route and ended up driving twice the distance.

Project
 manager John Callas, of the Nasa Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said 
Endeavour crater is arguably the most important science target since 
landing.

Craters are 
carved by asteroids or comets impacting into the Martian surface and 
exposing geological layers from different points in history. Endeavour 
is the fourth crater that Opportunity will explore and offers the oldest
 deposits yet.
