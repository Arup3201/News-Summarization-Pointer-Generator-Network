Gareth Bale had just performed his latest act of heroism in a football shirt, dragging Wales back from the brink of embarrassment in Andorra with a brace of supreme quality, when he straight away switched his focus to making history.

Qualification for Euro 2016 is in his sights now, a first major tournament for Wales since the 1958 World Cup. Plenty of illustrious predecessors have tried and failed, but Bale is displaying the bloody-mindedness required to succeed.

‘We’ve got one ticked off the list and we have nine more to go,’ he said of the Andorra win and Group B matches to come against Belgium, Bosnia, Cyprus and Israel.

‘I’ve had a taster of the big nights with Madrid. It’s great to get experience of the highest level of club competition and hopefully I can help us qualify for a major tournament.’

If any further evidence was required of how much Wales means to the world’s most expensive player, this was it. He produced a match-winning performance inside a stadium holding just 3,300 people in the remote principality in the Pyrenees. He played the full 90 minutes as if it was his last, driving forward until the unthinkable defeat was fully overturned.

‘The biggest honour you can have is to play for your country and to see the fans turn out like that for an away game was special,’ Bale said. ‘I don’t think many countries could do that.

‘I’ve had some great nights with my club side but I’m looking forward to our next games in the campaign and hopefully we can get that qualification and have success with Wales too.’

Bale’s two goals took his total to 14 in 45 caps. Ian Rush’s record total of 28 looks under threat. Up next in October are matches in Bale’s home town of Cardiff against Bosnia and Cyprus.

‘The next two home games will be key for us,’ said Bale.

His two-goal display was all the more impressive given that he produced it on a terrible artificial surface. His team-mate Aaron Ramsey hit out at the pitch that has left him fighting for fitness ahead of Arsenal’s key clash with Manchester City on Saturday.

The midfielder suffered an injury to his right ankle after falling awkwardly on the 3G surface. The new pitch was certified by UEFA only last week

‘The pitch was very hard, there was no give,’ said Ramsey. ‘I rolled my ankle late on. I could feel it. I hope I’ll be available for Saturday. Manchester City at home, those are the games you want to play.’

‘I just don’t know how you’re meant to play football on that pitch. It was very frustrating, you couldn’t play the ball quickly. It was very difficult.

‘We couldn’t get into our stride. Normally we play quick, keep it on the floor, play around teams. We couldn’t do that, we had to take the extra touch. I hope that’s the last time I play on a plastic pitch.’
