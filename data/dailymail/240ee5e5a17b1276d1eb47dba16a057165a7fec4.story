A pet store owner from Richland, Washington who wants to promote healthy eating for pets and their owners has vowed to only eat animal food for an entire month.

Dorothy Hunter, the owner of Paws Natural Pet Emporium, didn't have time to get a snack one day while she was stocking shelves so she nibbled on a treat meant for dogs and it wasn't too shabby.

'I didn't have time to go get a snack,' she told NBC.

Dorothy Hunter, co-owner of Paw's Natural Pet Emporium, shares a chicken jerky dog treat with her furry friend after vowing to eat pet food for an entire month

Dorothy Hunter claims that the treats she sells in her store meant for dogs are healthier than the average breakfast bar designed for humans

'so I grabbed a bag of treats off the counter, and I was like, wow, you know, these read better than normal people treats. So I started eating the treats and I was like, you know, I could do this for 30 days,' she said.

Hunter's been eating salmon flakes and freeze dried chicken meant for cats and dogs for a week now and she can see herself following her strictly pet-food diet for three more weeks.

Dorothy says she isn't eating dog food because she prefers the taste, rather she is trying to promote health for animals and people alike.

When comparing the ingredients in a breakfast bar meant for a human versus a breakfast bar meant for a pet she found that the animal treat was healthier than its human counterpart and that the ingredients were much easier to understand.

She says the health benefits of eating pet food were immediately noticeable.

She reported losing weight and not feeling as tired at the end of the day as she usually does.

Dorothy Hunter was restocking the shelves in her store one day when she didn't have time to grab a snack so she opted for dog treats instead

Dorothy has been sharing the food with her co-workers who say that while the taste is a little dry that it's not so bad

'My feet aren't swelling as much as they usually do after I've been on a 10 hour day,' said Dorothy.

'I have lost 2.5 pounds, which i'm not going to complain about that, but I'm not doing this to promote dog food, or to loose weight... But at the same token I want to show that I believe in our products.'

She also says she doesn't mind the taste of salmon flakes and freeze dried chicken.

She's even developed some favorite pet food choices.

'I've also been doing our oven baked blueberry treats, as well as freeze dried green beans, carrots,' she told NBC.

'I'm even doing some canned cat food, one is a succulent chicken, and it actually tastes really good. So I'm really happy with that one. I don't do raw bones or meat products like that, or the frozen because i'm just not into raw.'

Despite only eating pet food, Dorothy says she hasn't given up on coffee and that's for the benefit pf her employees so that she doesn't fall asleep on the job.

Otherwise, she'd be in the dog house.
