'Shame on the New York Times,' bellowed a guest on Sean Hannity's radio show last night after the venerable newspaper printed the home address of Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.

The details were revealed in a news report on Officer Wilson's marriage to another police officer last month, less than ten weeks after he shot unarmed Michael Brown six times in a Ferguson street.

The address was included in a report on Officer Brown's marriage to Barbara Spradling, a fellow officer in the Ferguson Police Department.

We know where you live: Officer Darren Wilson, who shot unarmed black teenager Michael Brown six times in the street in Ferguson, Missouri, this summer, has had his home address published in The New York Times

Today a picture in the report been taken down, but the paper still gave the couple's address down to their road in 'a St Louis suburb about a half-hour drive from Ferguson'.

Hannity, a prominent right-winger whose radio talk show is syndicated across America, was incensed at what saw as irresponsible reporting on the part of The New York Times

'If anything happens to that man, his family, or that home, the culpability is with them,' he pronounced. 

A guest chimed in: 'If anything happens to them the family should own The New York Times.'

Hannity and his guest said that Officer Wilson and his family could now be at risk of reprisals from the same people who burned businesses in Ferguson after the grand jury's decision not to charge Officer Wilson was revealed.

A spokesman for The New York Times defended the decision to publish details of Officer Wilson's address. 'The story mentions only the name of the street where the couple have a house and that street has been widely reported on,' said Eileen Murphy in an email to the Washington Examiner.

'Arrest Darren Wilson': Demonstrators gathered last night for a protest in Boston, Massachusetts, against the decision by a grand jury not to bring any charges against Officer Wilson for killing Mr Brown, who was 18

Last night demonstrations continued to turn violent, with protesters breaking windows at City Hall and setting a squad care on fire.

By the end of the night 45 people had been arrested in Ferguson, most for failure to disperse, though at least one person was taken in after being part of a group that was throwing smoke bombs, flares and frozen water bottles at a line of officers.

It also came as tens of thousands of people in more than 170 cities across America - including Atlanta, Boston, Philadelphia, New York and Los Angeles - were demonstrating against the decision for a second night.

Officer Wilson has been on paid administrative leave from Ferguson police department since killing Mr Brown on August 9.

He and Officer Spradling, the new Mrs Wilson, have hardly been at their Crestwood property since the day of the shooting. Neighbours said they abruptly left days after.
