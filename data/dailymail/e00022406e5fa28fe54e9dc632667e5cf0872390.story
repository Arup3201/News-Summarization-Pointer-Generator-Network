Madam Speaker Bronwyn Bishop proved she was not to be messed with yesterday afternoon after she suspended a record-breaking 18 MPs from Question Time in Canberra.

The penultimate sitting of the Parliament's Question Time seemed to bring out the raucous side of the MPs - all of whom represented the Labor Party - who were speaking out of turn and hurling comments down from the benches. 

All of the 18 MPs were given their marching orders in the space of one hour, as Ms Bishop cut them off one at a time, naming and shaming them in front of their peers.

Furious Opposition MPs blasted the Labor members, claiming they were deliberately trying to evade Question Time for their own benefit.

Madam Bishop noted that her list of suspended MPs could have ulterior motives including many MPs who had planes to catch and others who were eager to get back on the campaign trail. 

Most of the MPs ejected from Parliament were possibly looking to return to their electorates for a three-day break before Parliament resumes for its final sitting next week.

Cutting remarks from Opposition Leader Bill Shorten about Madam Bishop's actions did not go down well. 

Mr Shorten said he believed the Speaker had picked on the Labor Party, however Ms Bishop shot back and put him in his place and said she gave them their marching orders due to their unacceptable behaviour. 

'Simply to stand there and try and say that you all behaved like little angels and were picked on is pathetic,' she said to Mr Shorten.

According to the ABC, the Leader of the House Christopher Pyne called the Opposition 'idiots' after they were ejected from Parliament. 

'The Australian public should know that the Labor Party have run a deliberate strategy of ejection today from the House.

'They have deliberately attempted to be thrown out,' he said.  

As the absurd session came to an end,  Tony Burke, manager of Opposition business, commented on the enormity of the suspensions.

 'At risk of adding to the total, I should note that 18 people in one Question Time is an all-time record since Federation,' he said. 

Madam Bishop's Question Time lasted an unprecedented 70 minutes and she broke the previous record of 12 for the amount of suspensions in one Parliament sitting. 

Ms Bishop is known for her hard knuckled approach to the MPs behaviour, having suspended 285 MPs in the 44th Parliament.
