A U.S. company has manufactured and tested the world's first 3D-printed metal gun.

The weapon was made using a 'laser sintering process' and powdered metals and based on a 'classic' 1911 design.

The 3D printing specialists behind the weapon claim it 'functions beautifully' and has already handled 50 rounds of successful firing.

U.S. firm Solid Concepts have made the first 3D printed gun. The weapon was made using a 'laser sintering process' and powdered metals. It is based on a 'classic' 1911 design

Every part of the gun except for the springs is made with 'direct metal laser sintering,' which makes metal parts from a 3D design by blasting powdered metal with a laser.

The main body of the weapon is composed of 30 components made from stainless steel and an alloy called inconel as well as carbon fibre and a nylon hand grip.

The company claims the metal laser sintering process it used is one of the most accurate additive manufacturing process available and that the 3D printed parts have more detail and are less porous than conventionally made components.

The company's 'gun expert' has fired 50 rounds successfully so far using the 3D printed weapon, to prove the 3D printing technology's durability and viability to be used in modern mass manufacturing of similar products

The gun has been made by a specialist 3D printing firm based in Austin, Texas, which says: 'The successful production and functionality of the 1911 3D Printed metal gun proves the viability of 3D printing for commercial applications.'

While many people might find the prospect of being able to print metal guns frightening, the firm said what it is doing is perfectly legal.

'In fact, as far as we know, we’re the only 3D Printing Service Provider with a Federal Firearms License (FFL), said Kent Firestone, Vice President of Additive Manufacturing at Solid Concepts.

The firm plans on using the technology to print parts for weapons.

'Now if a qualifying customer needs a unique gun part in five days, we can deliver,' Mr Firestone said.

The company chose the 1911 model because the design is in the public domain, which in theory means people with access to the 3D printed technology could make a similar weapon.

The equipment needed to produce such a weapon costs around £529,000.

However, the Solid Concepts said it has not developed the weapon as a cheaper and easier way of making guns, but wants to prove that 3D printing is a viable solution that can be used in modern manufacturing and is here to stay.

The 3D printed gun barrel sees chamber pressures above 20,000 psi every time it is fired. The company said it developed the weapon to prove the reliability, accuracy and usability of metal 3D printing

'It’s a common misconception that 3D Printing isn’t accurate or strong enough, and we’re working to change people’s perspective,' said Mr Firestone.

The 3D printed gun barrel sees chamber pressures above 20,000 psi (pounds per square inch) every time it is fired.

Mr Firestone said: 'The
whole concept of using a laser sintering process to 3D Print a metal 
gun revolves around proving the reliability, accuracy and usability of 
metal 3D Printing as functional prototypes and end use products'.

The pistol is first tested at a distance, before the gun expert fires it himself and proves the weapon is accurate and on a par with conventional weapons
