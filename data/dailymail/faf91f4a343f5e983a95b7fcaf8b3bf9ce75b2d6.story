In the boys' corner they have some of cinema's leading men.

And in the girls' corner they have international superstars of the catwalk.

Prada have unveiled their new-look spring/summer 2013 campaign, and it is a veritable feast of famous faces, including actors Harvey Keitel, Benicio Del Toro and Aaron Taylor-Johnson for the menswear line, and current and veteran supermodels including Eva Herzigova, Amber Valetta and Sasha Pivovarova for womenswear.

The usual suspect: Benicio Del Toro, star of Traffic and The Usual Suspects, features in the new Prada spring/summer 2013 campaign

Up-and-coming American actor Dane DeHaan also features in the menswear campaign, in which four male actors model Prada's lightweight coats, shirts, trousers, sweaters.

The luxury designer brand is no stranger to using celebrities to model their clothes - Prada's autumn/winter 2012-13 menswear campaign starred actors Gary Oldman, Willem Dafoe, Jamie Bell and Garrett Hedlund.

Describing the new menswear campaign, a spokesman for the brand said that with 'simplicity, detail and the emergence of a new elegance' Prada is 'setting a new focus for its visual menswear story'.

The four men star in an intimate series of black and white portraits, shot in London by David Sims on bare sets.

Meanwhile in the womenswear campaign, models Eva Herzigova, Sasha Pivovarova, Amber Valletta, Vanessa
Axente, Saskia de Brauw, Irina Kravchenko, Sung Hee, Irene Hiemstra, 
Kirsten Owen, Maartje Verhoef and Raquel Zimmermann wear a more 
colourful line of bold floral prints.

According to Prada, the minimalist 
studio portraits shot by Steven Meisel aim to reveal the models' iindividual personas' and chanel 'Prada's new take on modern 
femininity'.
