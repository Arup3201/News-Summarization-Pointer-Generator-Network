Police are investigating claims a Twitter troll   posted an offensive message about the Glasgow lorry crash shortly after the accident.

There was anger on the social network yesterday after a message circulated which appeared to joke about the tragedy which killed six people in the Scottish city.

A complaint about the message was made to the police just before 9pm yesterday and officers confirmed they are planning to speak to a website user from Sunderland.

Flowers at the scene where a bin lorry crashed in Glasgow yesterday, killing six. Police are investigating an offensive message said to have been posted on Twitter after the accident

A spokesman for Northumbria Police said: 'We can confirm police are carrying out inquiries into reports of an offensive message posted on Twitter in relation to the Glasgow collision.'

The Twitter account which users complained about has since been taken down.

Police are carrying out a detailed investigation at the scene of the crash this morning to work out what caused a bin lorry to career along a crowded pavement.

Eight people were injured and six died after the lorry lost control in a crowded square before crashing into the side of a hotel.

The accident happened in George Square, which was packed with Christmas shoppers and families enjoying the annual winter carnival.

Witnesses believe the lorry driver became ill behind the wheel and lost control of the council vehicle 

A fleet of private ambulances with police outriders left the crash site early this morning.

A large cordon remains in place and dozens of floral tributes have been placed at the scene.

One witness yesterday described the lorry as knocking people down 'like pinballs' in the crash which happened at around 2.30pm.

It is thought the driver may have fallen ill at the wheel as he travelled up Queen Street and his vehicle struck a pedestrian outside the Gallery of Modern Art.

The Reverend Alastair Duncan will lead a service at the nearby St George's Tron at 11.30am.
