She has never made any claims to being a brilliant businesswoman but it seems that is exactly what Pippa Middleton is.

The Duchess of Cambridge's younger sister has raked in nearly a quarter of a million pounds in the last year, according to figures released by Companies House.

Pippa is the sole director and shareholder of PXM Enterprises Limited which has assets totalling £229,241, including £211,521 in cash in its first year.

By contrast, the companies belonging to younger brother James have never posted a profit and two have now been de-registered.

The two, Nice Cakes Ltd and Nice Wine Ltd, had assets worth just £20 when they closed, according to Companies House paperwork.

As a result, Pippa has made approximately £229,221 more than her brother in the period between the company’s incorporation in May 2013 and the end of May last year.

In it, she lists the nature of the business as being 'Other publishing activities', perhaps in a reference to her much-maligned party book, Celebrate!.

Along with the book, Pippa, 31, is believed to have earned the money with a number of writing assignments, which including her regular column for supermarket magazine, Waitrose Kitchen.

Not so good: James, despite being entrepreneurial, has had considerably less success

Losses: James, seen here at Prince George's Christening, closed his Nice companies early this month

She also penned a series of columns in her position as a contributing editor of Vanity Fair and another for a British newspaper.

Her other source of income comes from her parents' company Party Pieces, where Pippa is employed to edit web magazine, the Party Times.

The documents show that after paying creditors  £115,000, her business was left with a profit of £115,192.

Despite not being considered the business brain of the Middleton clan, Pippa has so far managed to outdo brother James and follows in the footsteps of their mother Carole, who is also a first-class businesswoman.

He is currently concentrating on his latest venture, bespoke marshmallow firm Boomf, which is yet to file accounts.

His other business, The Cake Kit Company, is still trading but according to Mr Middleton, sells only 'business to business'.

Speaking in an email sent to Daily Mail journalist Sebastian Shakespeare early this month, he added: 'The companies I’ve requested to be struck off have never traded. 

'My work focus at the moment is just on Boomf, which is proving to be a very excited [sic] business.’

Mr Middleton has, at least, had something to celebrate. Along with Pippa, he is recently returned from a trip to the Caribbean where they celebrated Carole's 60th birthday.

With them in Mustique were the Duke of Cambridge, who arrived in Japan today, the Duchess of Cambridge and 18-month-old Prince George.
