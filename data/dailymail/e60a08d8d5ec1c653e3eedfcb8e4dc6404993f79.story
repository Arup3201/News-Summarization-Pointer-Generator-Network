Actress Mila Kunis has taken a break from the big screen in order to turn her hand to jewelry design in celebration of the birth of her first child with fiance Ashton Kutcher.

The 31-year-old, who gave birth to daughter Wyatt Isabelle on October 1, has teamed up with Gemfields, the world's leading supplier of ethically-sourced gemstones, and jewelry brand Marina B in order to design a limited edition gold and emerald 'motherhood ring', the profits from which will be donated to a maternity center in Zambia.

Crafted in 18 karat yellow gold and featuring a Gemfields Zambian emerald, the ring, which will retail for $4,800, is currently available for pre-order on the Marina B website.

'A symbol of hope': Mila chose an emerald as her gem of choice because it is traditionally seen as a symbol of motherhood and hope

Speaking to Vogue.co.uk, Mila, 31, explained the significance of the emerald as a symbol of hope for mothers around the world. 

'Carrying a child and bringing new life into the world marks the start of an incredible journey,' she said. 

'Throughout history, every culture has its own way of recognizing this extraordinary event, often with a gift for mother or child. Precious green emeralds are traditionally symbols of motherhood, wisdom, and long-lasting love. 

'But they are also a symbol for hope in many cultures, and so the proceeds from this collection of Motherhood Rings will benefit the opening of Gemfields Nkana Health Centre, where four new wards have been built - a major undertaking that will have long-lasting benefits to the local community.'

Since giving birth to her daughter last month, Mila has kept a very low public profile, preferring instead to spend time at home with her family.

In the July issue of Marie Claire, the Black Swan star spoke about motherhood and the way in which she hoped to raise her children.

'I just don't want my kids to be a**holes,' the Ukrainian-born actress said. 'I feel like so many kids nowadays are. Both of us just want to have well-behaved, honest, nice children who people meet and say, "That's a good kid."'  

Mila - who was born Milena - is due to return to our screens later this year, starring alongside Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz in a big screen remake of hit musical Annie. 

She will also play Jupiter Jones in upcoming sci-fi flick Jupiter Ascending - due out February 6 - with Channing Tatum, Eddie Redmayne, and Sean Bean.
