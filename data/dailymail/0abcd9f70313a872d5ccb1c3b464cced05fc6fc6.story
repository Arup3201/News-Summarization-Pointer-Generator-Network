Aston Villa have completed the signing of Valencia attacking midfielder Carles Gil for £3.25million. 

Paul Lambert welcomed the Spain Under-21 international to Villa Park on Tuesday afternoon after Gil signed a four-and-a-half year deal with the Barclays Premier League club.

The 22-year-old can operate on either wing or behind the striker, and Lambert hopes he will bring a 'creative spark' after seeing Villa score just 11 goals in 21 Premier League games.

2015-NOW: Aston Villa (0, 0) 

'We've been on the lookout for a creative player and he will certainly bring that extra element to the side,' Lambert told Villa's official website.

'He's only 22 years of age but he will come here and give us something I don't think we have at the moment. He can play either role, coming in off the sides or playing in behind as well.

'He can create chances and get those chances put away. He has a lot to offer and I know we can get the best out of him.'

And Gil, leaving the La Liga club he has been with since a youth, is prepared to show the supporters what he can do in England.

'Once I knew that this club was interested in me I wanted to join,' admitted Gil. 'I am really looking forward to playing here and showing the fans what I can do.

Gil started with Valencia as a youth but said: 'Once I knew that this club was interested in me I wanted to join'

'I can play on either side or in the middle of midfield and I like playing as part of the team, making things happen for my team-mates.

'This is a very historic club in England, a very important club in the Premier League, and I am looking forward to playing for such a great club in a league that is the top league in the world.'

Villa were booed off by their supporters after losing 1-0 against bottom club Leicester City on Saturday, and Gil will be tasked with helping turn their fortunes around.

The move sees the Spaniard reunited with Villa's Colombian defensive midfielder Carlos Sanchez, a former team-mate of his during his loan spell at Elche last season.
