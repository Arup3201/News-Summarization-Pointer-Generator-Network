A widower has described the emotional moment a rainbow appeared at the spot where he scattered his beloved wife's ashes.

Retired scientist Deryk Walker, 85, was devastated by the death of his wife, Vera, 84, who had osteoporosis and died following a fall from her wheelchair.

He decided to scatter her ashes by Trinity Lighthouse at Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, where the couple lived and where Vera used to enjoy walking the family dog.

Deryk and his family also bought a nearby beachfront bench in Vera's memory, and two months after scattering the ashes he and his daughter Sally England and her husband were sitting on it when a rainbow formed, springing out of the lighthouse where her ashes lay.

Deryk, 85, who lives in Burnham-on-Sea, said: 'It was incredible. It must have been a sign.

'I don't really believe in God but I think this must have been a spotlight shining down from heaven.

'It's amazing that my daughter managed to get a picture of it on her phone.

'Vera used to love the beach, we'd walk up and down it and we'd often take my daughter's dog with us too. She was such a lovely person.'

Vera died in September following a fall from her wheelchair which left her with a broken hip.

Doctors operated on her and had hoped she would make a full recovery, but she died a day later.
