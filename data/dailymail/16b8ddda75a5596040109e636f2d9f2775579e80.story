Crocodiles have a fearsome enough reputation as it is.

But this footage reveals that not even their own young are safe from a pair of snapping jaws.

Tourists on a wildlife cruise in the Daintree River in Queensland, Australia, came across this two-metre beast chewing on a smaller juvenile.

Crocked: Cannibalism among crocodiles is not uncommon but is rarely captured on film  

Solar Whisper Wildlife Cruise owner David White said the crocodile, nicknamed Eric, was fishing along the edge of the river bank.

'Eric was swimming and fishing 
along the edge of the mud, probably waiting for fish or crabs to move, 
and acting normal, so we kept on moving,' he told The Cairns Post.

'When we came back past we saw him with a much smaller 2011-model baby crocodile in his mouth.

'He had obviously killed it and was attempting to swallow it but it was just a little too big, so he swam away with it.

'When we saw him a few days later he had a big belly so he must have finished it.'

Experts say cannibalism among crocodiles is not uncommon and suggest it be a way for males to reduce the number of competitors.
