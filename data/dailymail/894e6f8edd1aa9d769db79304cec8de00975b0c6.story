Sweets could be banned from supermarket checkouts under a health drive being drawn up by the government.

New public health minister Jane Ellison signalled a fresh crackdown on tackling junk food promotion, after her predecessor Anna Soubry said ‘there is nothing wrong with sweets’.

Now Ms Ellison has identified the issue as ‘an area for action’ and will tell the industry to cut promotions of unhealthy snacks.

Crackdown: Sweets and treats at supermarket checkouts have become an 'area for action' in the drive to improve the nation's health

When he first became Tory leader David Cameron famously took aim at WH Smith for promoting chocolate oranges instead of real ones.

But the coalition has been conflicted about whether the government should dictate what stores can sell.

In July this year Ms Soubry said it was ‘worrying’ that some supermarkets ‘continue to influence people – especially young children – to pick up sweets and chocolate while waiting at the checkout’.

She said that food manufacturers and retailers ‘bear a responsibility’ to help people to live longer, healthier lives.

Pester: Parents complain that the positioning of chocolate means children demand treats

But just weeks later she insisted she
 would not ban so-called ‘guilt lanes’. She added: ‘I dislike the idea 
that if you treat yourself you should feel guilty. I just said no to my 
children.’

Ms Soubry was moved to the Ministry of Defence in this month’s reshuffle, and replaced by Ms Ellison.

Now Ms Ellisson has signalled that she will take action against junk food at checkouts.

In response to a parliamentary question, she said:
 ‘There is evidence that the majority of food promoted at checkouts and 
in queuing areas is less healthy than elsewhere, and that foods sold at 
impulse purchase points such as checkouts experience uplifts in sales.

Obesity: New public health minister Jane Ellison complained that many of the snacks on offer at checkouts are among the least healthy

‘According to one report, parents have indicated that positioning of sweets at checkouts can increase pestering to purchase by their children.

‘We have identified food promotion as an area for action under the Responsibility Deal, and will be discussing with the food industry actions it might take to reduce exposure to marketing and promotion of less healthy foods.’

In England, 16.3 per cent of children aged two to 15 are obese and 13.7 per cent of children aged two to 15 are overweight – making them far more likely to develop health conditions like type two diabetes and heart disease.

A Department of Health spokesman said: 'We have been clear that legislation is not necessary and that the voluntary approach through the Responsibility Deal is working.

'It has already significantly reduced artificial trans-fat, calories and salt in foods, and set-up consistent front of pack food labelling which all the major supermarkets and several big manufacturers have signed up to.

'That is why we have identified food promotion as an area for action under the Responsibility Deal, and will be discussing with the food industry actions it might take to reduce exposure to marketing and promotion of less healthy foods.'

In 2006 Mr Cameron condemned ‘irresponsible’ marketing designed to coax people into buying sweets and chaoclate.

‘Try and buy a newspaper at the train station and, as you queue to pay, you're surrounded, you're inundated by cut price offers for giant chocolate bars,’ he said.

‘As Britain faces an obesity crisis, why does WH Smith's promote half-price Chocolate Oranges at its checkouts instead of real oranges?’

Among the worst offenders visited by the Mail earlier this year were:

M & S:
 Shoppers forced to queue in a snaking aisle fenced in by racks of 
snacks. On child-height shelves were rows of Percy Pig and Colin 
Caterpillar sweets.

W H SMITH: Garish
 signs advertising three Wispa bars for £1 and two-for-£2 Coca-Cola 
bottles. Checkout assistants often presented customers with further 
offers.

POUNDLAND: Five-foot walls of boxes of sweets and chocolates led to the checkout.

PRIMARK: Sweets
 such as Haribo, Chewits, Mentos and Polos on offer at £1 for five 
packets sat beside socks and underwear at the queues for the tills.

SAINSBURY’S:
 Most large branches had few sweets on display at main tills, but 
self-checkout customers were funnelled through temptation to reach the 
units. At convenience-style ‘Local’ stores, customers were met with rows
 of mints and chocolate bars before they could get to the checkouts.

BOOTS: Sweets and snacks such as crisps had a  prominent place on the way to the tills.
