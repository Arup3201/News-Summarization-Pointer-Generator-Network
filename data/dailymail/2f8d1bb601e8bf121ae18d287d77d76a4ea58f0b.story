ISIS supporters have been handing out leaflets to  Oxford Street shoppers encouraging them to leave Britain for its new Islamic state.

The radicals stood in front of posters declaring 'the dawn of a new era has begun' in reference to the caliphate and their literature praised the 'sacrifices' made in the Middle East.

Scotland Yard has said today it is investigating whether the men were breaking terror laws.

Propaganda: ISIS supporters have been handing out leaflets to Oxford Street shopper encouraging them to leave Britain for Syria and Iraq

Rules: The literature sets out how people should live their lives and encourages them to leave Britain for the caliphate

One Muslim woman who confronted the men, believed to be from Luton and linked to hate preachers Anjem Choudary and Omar Bakri, said she was racially abused.

Asmaa Al-kufaishi, tweeted: 'This group are promoting ISIS on Oxford Street. Racially abused us when we spoke out. They don’t know Islam.

'Promoting death of innocent people, telling me to die because of my faith and race and insulting me is not Islamic behaviour.'

Pictures of the men and their leaflets have spread across social media.

The literature describes the 'glad tidings' that 'Muslims with the help of Allah have announced the re-establishment of the Khilafah (sic) and appointed an imam as a Khaleef (sic).'

It also sets out seven rules for supporters, including to 'obey' the leaders of ISIS, Sharia law, 'migrate' from the UK to the caliphate and 'expose lies' about the extremist group.

Today, ISIS, which now styles itself simply Islamic State (IS), has become a powerful military force that now has control of an area larger than Great Britain. 

Its extremists - which include hundreds of Britain - have carried out such acts of such extreme brutality that Al Qaeda has severed all links with them.

The leafleting yesterday has led to calls for police action.

A Met spokesman said: 'The MPS has been made aware, via social media, of leaflets which reports state were being distributed in the Oxford Street area. We are assessing the content of the leaflets to establish whether any criminal offences have been committed'.

Ghaffar Hussain, managing director of the anti-extremism foundation Quilliam, said it is a 'clear breach of the law'.

'This is a very disturbing development but one that should not come as a surprise since we are aware that around 500 British nationals have joined up with ISIS already.

'We need to have a zero tolerance policy towards ISIS supporters and recruiters in the UK.'

The ISIS ‘caliphate’ – or Islamic state – stretches across wartorn Syria and Iraq.

The terrorist group say it represents the biggest shift in the political geography of the Middle East since  the borders of the two countries were drawn under the Sykes-Picot agreement drafted between Britain and France in 1916.

For some extremist organisations a caliphate is considered a utopian concept rather than a reality, but ISIS believe it is something to be fought for and established.

As well as claiming it as a nation, and giving it a leader, ISIS has also taken over basic public services such as collecting rubbish, taxes, enforcing Sharia law, and replacing Imams in bigger cities with their own Imams etc.

Law and order is enforced by deterrence. They have public show trials where defendants get publicly lashed or executed.

Andreas Krieg, a Middle East security analyst at King's College London in Qatar, told MailOnline: 'With limited forces available to administer the country, the local population could probably cause major problems if they rose up against ISIS.

'ISIS control is very fragile as people only co-operate due to fear not because they want to. Just because they have seized territory from official statutory power, it does not make them a statutory power.

'But they are learning and if there are able over the coming months and years to consolidate their power, they might be able to erect a quasi-regime loosely keeping all those territories together.'
