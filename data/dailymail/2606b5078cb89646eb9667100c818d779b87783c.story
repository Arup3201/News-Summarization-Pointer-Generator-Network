Threats: Neil Andersen has been handed an indefinite prison term after he admitted setting fire to a sex shop. He previously stalked a BBC actress

A disgruntled customer who admitted setting fire to a sex shop and had previously stalked a BBC actress has been handed an indefinite prison sentence.

A judge at Bristol Crown Court told Neil Andersen, 43, he considered him 'dangerous' and that he was imprisoning him for public protection.

Andersen, who has a psychotic illness and has previously threatened to fire bomb a pub, said he had set fire to the sex shop on the Lower Bristol Road, in Bath, because he was 'frustrated' with the owners.

He told the startled shop worker 'I’ve got a surprise for you' before pouring petrol around the shop - above which lived a family - and then setting it alight on October 21 last year.

Andersen, of Wedmore Park, Bath, Somerset, pleaded guilty to arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered after a judge ordered a jury to acquit him of the more serious charge of arson with intent to endanger life.

The court heard the defendant had 11 convictions for 18 previous offences which included affray and stalking women.

Andersen had previously harassed a BBC actress - who was not named in court - and had turned up at studios in Cardiff armed with a knife, threatening to harm her boyfriend.

He had also made threats against mental health staff and in 1993 he had threatened to fire bomb a pub after being thrown out of the premises.

Andersen has a mixed personality disorder and following assessments by two psychiatrists was found to be dangerous and delusional.

But the court heard that Andersen could not be detained in a psychiatric hospital 
because the two psychiatrists who had assessed him did not agree this 
was necessary.

The court heard he has a number of conspiracy theories and had told police that he was being persecuted because people were mistaking him for Martin Stenning - a freelance photographer who had been barred in the mid-1990s from taking photographs of Diana, Princess of Wales.

Recorder Ben Compton QC told Andersen he was satisfied he posed a dangerous risk to the public based on the psychiatric reports.

Passing an indefinite prison sentence, the judge said Andersen would have to serve at least four years in prison before being considered for parole.

Prosecutor Richard Posner told the court Andersen had bought a green petrol container from DIY store Homebase before going to a Sainsbury’s petrol station to fill it up.

He then walked the short distance to the sex shop, which sells sex toys and pornographic material, at about 7pm.

Mr Posner said shop worker Mark Morris remembered telling Andersen that a family lived upstairs, before fleeing the shop.

The flames destroyed the premises, owned by Darker Enterprises Ltd, but the court heard there had been no intent to endanger life.

'He (Andersen) was frustrated with the products in the adult shop,' Mr Posner said.

'CCTV footage of what this defendant did shows liquid thrown around the adult shop and then lit. It went up in flames.'

The court previously heard Andersen told police after his arrest: 'My gripe is with the company that runs the shop, not the worker.

'I have a gripe about some of the DVDs they sell and produce and I have been receiving hassle from someone.

'My gripe is that the company used to use a courier in the capital and he got dropped into the s*** when he lost some property.'

Andersen went on to tell police that he was being persecuted because people were mistaking him for Martin Stenning, a freelance photographer who had been barred in the mid-1990s from taking photographs of Diana, Princess of Wales.

'I am getting hassle left, right and centre,' he told detectives.

Dr Sabarigirivasan Muthukrishnan, a locum consultant psychiatrist, told the judge that because of Andersen’s personality disorder he posed a 'varied' risk to the public.

He said Andersen was able to premeditate, meticulously plan and carry out certain actions.

The psychiatrist told the judge Andersen had threatened doctors and mental health staff and agreed that he had phoned the workplace of the BBC actress, posing as a psychiatrist himself, in order to contact her.

James Bennett, for Andersen, said his client took exception with 'some force' to the fact he was referred to as 'delusional' and that Andersen claimed he could prove his 'conspiracies' were factually correct.

He added his client felt aggrieved by the court system and believed that his sentencing had been rushed.

Balding and bespectacled Andersen showed no emotion as the judge passed sentence.
