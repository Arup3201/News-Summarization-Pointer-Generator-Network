As marijuana for medical and recreational uses continues to gain broader acceptance throughout America, health officials are worried that the drug's widespread acceptance is leading to an increase in traffic fatalities.

Researchers at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health say that as marijuana use has become more widely accepted, fatal crashes involving the drug have tripled.

'Currently, one of nine drivers involved in fatal crashes would test 
positive for marijuana,' Dr. Guohua Li, director of the 
Center for Injury Epidemiology and Prevention at Columbia and a co-author of the study. 'If this 
trend continues, in five or six years non-alcohol drugs will overtake 
alcohol to become the most common substance involved in deaths related 
to impaired driving.'

Acceptance: As more people begin to accept marijuana use, experts worry there will be more fatal car wrecks

The study analyzed statistics from nearly 24,000 drivers who were killed in auto accidents between 1999 and 2010 and who died within an hour of the crash.

Researchers looked at the toxicology reports of victims of these types of crashes in six states: California, Hawaii, Illinois, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and West Virginia.

The study found that alcohol-related deaths from traffic accidents stayed consistent at about 40 percent throughout the decade, drug-related traffic fatalities jumped from 16 percent in 1999 to 28 percent by 2010.

In the drug-related fatalities, 12 percent of the 2010 crashes involved marijuana. In 1999, only four percent of traffic fatalities involved marijuana.

Legal: Marijuana for recreational use has been approved in both Colorado and Washington

The study acknowledges that just because traces of marijuana are found in a victim's blood it doesn't necessarily mean that person was impaired at the time of the wreck.

'The prevalence of nonalcohol drugs reported in this study should be 
interpreted as an indicator of drug use, not necessarily a measurement 
of drug impairment,' the authors of the study note.Â 

The study also reveals that a combination of alcohol and marijuana increases a driver's risk of dying in a fatal crash.

'If a driver is under the influence of alcohol, their risk of a fatal 
crash is 13 times higher than the risk of the driver who is not under 
the influence of alcohol,' Li said. 'But if the driver is under the 
influence of both alcohol and marijuana, their risk increases to 24 
times that of a sober person.'

Highway safety officials argue that as marijuana use becomes accepted even further, there could be an even further influx of drug-related traffic fatalities.

MADD: Mothers Against Drunk Driving President Jan Withers echoes researcher's concerns that marijuana acceptance could lead to more deadly wrecks

'The legalization of pot is going to spread to other states. It's not 
even a partisan issue at this point. Our expectation is this will become
 the norm rather than the rarity,' Deputy executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association, Jonathan Adkins, told Breitbart.com.

Jan Withers, the national president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, has similar concerns.

'This study shows an alarming increase in driving under the influence
 of drugs and, in particular, it shows an increase in driving under the 
influence of both alcohol and drugs,' Withers said in a statement. 'When it comes to drugged driving 
versus drunk driving, the substances may be different but the 
consequences are the same -- needless deaths and injuries.'
