It's been nearly two months since their 19-year-old son was found dead after an early-morning fraternity activity, and Gary and Cindy Hipps still don't have any answers explaining his mysterious and untimely death.

The  body of Clemson University freshman Tucker Hipps was found submerged in the Seneca River at the end of September, hours after his brothers at the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity reported him missing. It's believed the pledge class president fell off a 20ft bridge into the water.

Hipps was last seen on a pre-dawn run with his brothers on September 22 where he started to fall behind, but was allegedly first noticed missing when he didn't show up for breakfast that morning. 

His parents are now speaking out, believing someone knows what happened to their only son that morning and is holding back.

'That's a horrible thing to hold inside, it's going to affect you for life,' Mrs Hipps told Fox Carolina. 'It's going to affect all of your relationships. It's going to affect your school, it will affect how you deal with things. It might not feel so bad right now, but as time goes on it gets worse and worse. Truth, the power of truth sets you free.'

The incident is still under investigation by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division and Oconee County Sheriff's Office. They are not speaking about the case until their final report is published, with will include toxicology results.

Tucker's death is even more tragic considering his parents warned him against joining a fraternity, preferring he spend his time in college focusing on his studies. But they relented since he was a social young man and students in Greek Life organization do, on average, maintain higher grade-point averages.

Following Tucker's death, Clemson University suspended all Greek Life activities. It's unclear if that's suspension is still in place 

Tucker apparently fell from this bridge into the waters of the Senca River. Police are still investigating the incident, and will not be commenting on the case until they release their full report, including toxicology reports 

Mr and Mrs Hipps believe someone knows what happened to their son, and is holding the details back. They are now speaking out in hopes of inspiring that person or people to come forward. Pictured above, officers and campus police arriving at the scene where Tucker's body was found

 'I told him I'm not going to say you can't do it but I am not going to pay for it,' Mr Hipps told WSPA.

Just four days before he died, Tucker's parents had dinner with him, and they saw that the pledging process noticeably taking a toll.

'I can tell you that last time I saw him he was both tired and worn out he looked like he hadn't had much sleep,' his dad said. 'It was hard and I asked him I said are you feeling okay are you doing alright?'

Following Tucker's death, Clemson University suspended all Greek Life activities though they wouldn't say it was directly because of the incident. It's unclear if that suspension is ongoing. Calls to the university were not immediately returned Thursday morning.  

Mr Hipps (left) says he didn't want his son (right) to join a fraternity, but relented because he didn't want to deny  Tucker a place to be social. However, he did make his son get a job to pay for the fraternity fees himself 

The Hipps also hope their son's death will help bring change to the fraternity pledging process. Tucker pictured above with an unidentified young woman on the left

'There seems to be something systemically wrong with the pledging process, and how kids are put through the things they are put through,' Mr Hipps said, adding that he is not 'making any friends'  in the Greek community as he searches for answers in his son's death. 

Mr Hipps also expressed condolences to the family of Nolan Burch, a West Virginia University student who died last week after he was found unconscious at his fraternity house. 

'When people begin to be injured and die then it's time to really take a hard look at processes that put our children in danger,' Mr Hipps added. 

Now the Hipps are faced with the prospect of spending Christmas without their only son for the first time. However, they plan to celebrate as they usually do, decorating the house and putting Tucker's special ornaments on the tree.
