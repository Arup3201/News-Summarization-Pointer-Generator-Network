Scott Dann was a fraction offside when he set up Glenn Murray for Palace’s first goal (2), but it would be harsh to put too much blame on assistant John Brooks. He was spot on with two equally tight calls in the same move — before Dann got the ball (1) and for Murray’s finish (3). The speed of it, plus two players blocking his view, made it unbelievably hard for him to get all three right.
