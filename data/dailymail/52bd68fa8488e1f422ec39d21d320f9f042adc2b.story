Maria Sharapova was knocked out of the Wuhan Open by Swiss qualifier Timea Bacsinszky in a shock 7-6 (3), 7-5 defeat in the third round on Wednesday.

Sharapova double-faulted six times in the first set, and was twice a break up in the second set, but couldn't shake off Bacsinszky, who earned the biggest win of her career with a win over the Russian world No 4.

Bacsinszky had two previous top-10 wins, the last in 2010, but both were by retirement.
