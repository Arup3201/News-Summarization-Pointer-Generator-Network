Being a mother is a stressful job. So it comes as no surprise that Octomom, real name Nadya Suleman, seeks ways to help her relax.

However, sources have revealed she holds a medical marijuana card and bakes goodies laced with the drug to help cope with her anxieties. 

It was reported that the 37-year-old eats the pot cookies at home when she is in sole care of her 14 children, and believes they are not at risk when she has ingested the drug.

Octomom, Nadya Suleman, who reportedly makes herself marijuana cookies, was seen at a McDonald's drive-thru in Los Angeles on Wednesday

Sources told TMZ Nadya 
got the card 2 days after leaving rehab for Xanax addiction and bakes the marijuana products both at home and on the road during media appearances, but not when her nannies are present.

There is no suggestion her children have ever been fed the pot-filled treats, but their diet may not be described as the healthiest either.

Hiding her eyes behind a pair of shades, Nadya appeared to be wearing a grey hooded top as she let her dark hair fall at her shoulders.

The mother-of-14 looked relaxed as she stopped at the order point to choose from the menu.

With the meals purchased, the reality TV star turned adult entertainer was seen cruising around in her white Octovan.

Last month Suleman's octuplets celebrated their fourth birthday but days later drama struck her household amid fears she had lost her seven-year-old son.

Nadya Suleman notified her son's school after being convinced he had not been dropped off by the school bus at the usual time, and immediately panicked as she attempted to locate her boy.

According to TMZ.com, school authorities were confused as the driver of the bus had 'personally witnessed' the mother-of-14 greet the child when he was dropped off by the bus.

Police were called to the home of the multiple-birth mother after school officials contacted them on account of being 'concerned' about the situation.

But by the time police arrived at the family home, the 37-year-old star had already located her son, who was sleeping in his bedroom.

Despite the tot usually taking naps after school, Nadya told police she was confused about the situation as she doesn't remember meeting him from the school bus, and thought somebody else must have dropped him off.
