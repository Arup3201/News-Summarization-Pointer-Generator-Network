She's lauded as one of the most stylish women in the world - and now one artist has celebrated the Duchess of Cambridge's fashion influence in a rather unusual way.

Italian AleXsandro Palombo  transformed Duchess of Cambridge into a dead ringer for a cast member of The Simpsons in a series of illustrations. 

The contemporary artist, illustrator and activist has 'Simpsonized' the Royal in a succession of her best-known outfits. 

Well, that's one way to celebrate her style! One artist has celebrated the Duchess of Cambridge's fashion choices in a rather bizarre way - by immortalising her as a Simpson

Marge, is that you? An Italian artist and blogger has immortalised the Duchess of Cambridge as you've never seen her before - yellow

Starring alongside the Queen at various Buckingham Palace settings, the new mother can be seen mocked up with the same facial expression as Homer, Marge and Bart Simpson.

His blog, entitled 'An exclusive tour at Buckingham Palace with Princess Kate Middleton and Queen Elizabeth II immortalized in their royal iconic style by artist aleXsandro Palombo' is the latest offering from the Italian blogger. 

His previous work includes recreating Disney princesses as disabled and as victims of domestic abuse on his blog Humor Chic.

While she has been staying at home with Prince George a lot lately, it was recently revealed that the Duchess of Cambridge will be guest of honour at a spectacular celebration in Malta next month, on her first solo foreign tour on behalf of the Queen.

Kate will leave her young son, Prince George, behind - as well as her husband, Prince William - for two days of official events to mark the 50th anniversary of the island’s independence from the UK.

It is a sign of her confidence in her grandson’s wife that the monarch has asked the Duchess to travel to the Mediterranean island which holds a special place in her heart. 

Celebration: The artist aimed to celebrate the former Kate Middleton's 'iconic Royal style' and he's even recreates her voluminous hairstyle and full eyebrows
