Sorely missed: Dan Stevens as Matthew Crawley and Michelle Dockery as Lady Mary Crawley are now parted forever

Downton Abbey’s Lady Mary is in deep mourning. She spends her days in her bedroom, dressed in black or purple, staring at a framed photograph of her late husband, Matthew, on the dressing table.

‘Anyone who tries to lift me out of it has an almost impossible task on their hands,’ says Michelle Dockery, who plays the recently widowed Lady Mary — and new mother of baby George — in the fourth series, which returns this weekend.

‘Lady Mary has gone back to being as unapproachable as she was in the first series, but for a different reason,’ says Michelle.

‘Then, she was a very petulant, spoilt
aristocrat, but over the years — and especially since she had known 
Matthew — she softened. But now, in her grief, she has put the barriers 
back up again.’

The last 
time we saw the great house standing proudly on its manicured lawns, in a
Christmas Day special, dark clouds were descending.

Dashing
young Matthew was killed when his open-top sports car crashed, just 
after the birth of George, heir to the family’s estate.

The
new series begins six months after Matthew’s death in 1922, with Lady 
Mary still consumed by grief and wondering whether she will make a good 
mother and be able to bond with her fatherless son.

Even
a consoling visit from the family’s trusted butler, Carson, cannot 
shake Lady Mary out of her depression.

Can Tom Branson, the wilful 
former chauffeur and widower of her sister Lady Sybil, be the one person
who can bring happiness back into her life again?

‘Although it’s a dark period in Mary’s life, I do enjoy playing that side of her, when she’s got more of a sting in her tail,’ says Michelle, 31.

As you will see, she’s even quite brutal with Carson (Jim Carter), whom she had always turned to for guidance.

‘She’s also very dismissive of caring Anna Bates [Joanne Froggatt], the head housemaid. She hurts people who want to help her.’

The
death of Matthew (Dan Stevens) shocked millions of viewers. It had been
a well-kept secret, although Stevens had for some time been signalling 
his intention to leave Downton and try his luck in Hollywood.

‘We’d
all signed up initially for three series of Downton, so the time was 
right for him to make his move,’ says Michelle. ‘Any of us could have 
made the same choice.

‘Of 
course, I would have loved Dan to have stayed, but there does come a 
point where you have to make decisions about your career and what you 
want to do.

‘I was worried 
at first because without Dan the story had to change. His character was 
not only my husband, but the hopes for the family’s estate were pinned 
on him.

‘It means that this
new series has had to take a real turn, something Julian Fellowes [the 
Oscar-winning writer] hadn’t bargained for.’

When Stevens first said that he wanted to leave at the end of series three, Fellowes urged him to wait until a convenient moment arose in an early episode in series four.

Then he would write him out by sending Matthew on a business trip to America, which would still leave the role open to him to return should things not work out later. He even offered to film some scenes in  New York.

But Stevens was determined to move on, so Fellowes reluctantly had Matthew make a dramatic exit in a fatal car crash — but not until the very end of the Christmas episode, so that viewers wouldn’t be as upset as they would be if it had happened mid-way through the show.

‘I’m not mourning Dan like Lady Mary is for her husband,’ says Michelle, ‘but I do miss him. We had become close and it has seemed strange without him.

‘It’s the same with Jessica Brown Findlay, who played my sister Lady Sybil, who died soon after bearing her baby daughter.

‘We all spent so much time together, and suddenly they are not there. Mary feels isolated in her grief — and I’m missing two good friends.’

So what is the future for Lady Mary? It’s clear, from the opening sequence of the new series, that it’s likely to be a long time before she will receive gentlemen suitors.

Says Michelle: ‘Mary is nowhere near ready. I don’t think it would be right for her to move on that swiftly — and the viewers wouldn’t like it, either. So you’ll have to see. It’s going to be a while.’

However, the gossip from the set is that there are admirers on the horizon. As Fellowes says: ‘A lot of men will be interested in a beautiful, clever, well-connected woman with a big estate. Women like that have a lot of pursuers.’

Although she forms an alliance-through-grief with her brother-in-law Tom Branson (Allen Leech), it is likely that their partnership will be more to do with fulfilling Matthew’s plans for modernising the estate, as well as sharing the problems of being single parents.

‘We are kindred spirits, but I am her rock, because her world has collapsed around her,’ says Leech. ‘That’s all there is to it.’

One hotly-tipped candidate for Lady Mary’s eventual affections is Lord Anthony Gillingham, an old family friend she’s known since they were children, played by 28-year-old Welsh actor Tom Cullen.

Another is the aristocratic Charles Blake, a role taken by Foyle’s War actor Julian Ovenden, and there is also speculation that Lady Mary shows a keen interest in Chicago jazz singer Jack Ross, played by Gary Carr.

‘I’m giving no clues,’ says Michelle Dockery. ‘But all I will say is that although at the start of the series we see Lady Mary reverting to being a glamorous ice princess, it will take a special man to make her melt.’
