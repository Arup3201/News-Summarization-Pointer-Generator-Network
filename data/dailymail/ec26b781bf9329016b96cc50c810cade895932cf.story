It's a fashion range chicks are bound to tweet about. A New Hampshire farm has been ruffling feathers in the fashion world with its clothes for farmyard animals.

Farmer Julie Baker started her poultry fashion line with a range of diapers to pamper her pet hens and keep her house clean.

'We wanted to be part of the “Backyard Chicken” movement,' Mrs Baker said.

The clothing range she made with her daughter at their Claremont farm quickly grew to include saddles to protect hens from the rough advances from roosters, and bonnets for geese.

The mother, who runs the Pampered Poultry website, said on her blog: 'When my daughter and I set out to 
design and sell chicken diapers, it was born not so much out of a need 
to literally pamper our poultry, but rather to share in the growing 
movement to bring chickens from an agriculture sphere and into the 
suburban/urban realm.'

Ms Baker told CBS Boston the diapers have allowed owners to bring their pet hens inside their homes without any mess. 

As well as her practical range, Mrs Baker sells dresses with bows, 
tailcoats and even a diaper with a bow tie attached.

Alongside her fashion business, Ms Baker runs a special breeds farm, made up of Nigerian dwarf goats, poodle geese and sumatra chickens.

What started out as a homemade solution to keep her hens inside has quickly become a successful business, with urban farmers ordering 50 to 100 of the diapers a week.

Her website also does a good trade in saddles for hens, to protect them against the 'not so gentle gentleman roosters,'.

'Saddles are almost more useful than the diaper, quite frankly,' she told NPR. 'A rooster isn't particularly kind to a hen when they mate. He grabs her by the back and pulls her feathers out.'

Her easy-to-fit saddles protect the hens during this rough mating ritual.

The farming family attend poultry shows, where their machine-washable diapers that fasten over the tail feathers, quickly caught the attention of the chicken world.

'Everyone wanted to know where we got them - and the orders started rolling in,' Ms Baker told the Huffington Post. I have a lot of customers that keep their chickens in the house full-time, and they love the diapers.'

Ms Baker's chicken creations have even caught the eye of Hollywood. On the Pampered Poulty Facebook page she announced this month that a reality TV show had been in touch about including them in a show about chicken lovers.
