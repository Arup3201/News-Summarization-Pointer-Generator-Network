The former lover of a beauty queen who fell 150ft to her death from his luxury apartment admitted he was leading a cocaine-fuelled ‘double life’, her inquest heard yesterday.

Rashid Jamil told police that catwalk model Sahar Daftary, 23, jumped from his balcony after he refused to leave his wife.

Mr Jamil, 37, said she had been crying as she told him: ‘It’s now or never, Rash.’

Yesterday her inquest in Bolton heard that Mr Jamil told police he had been having an affair with Miss Daftary for a couple of years after meeting her in London while on a business trip.

He claimed his marketing executive wife, Narhisa Amjad, knew about the relationship.

But he kept two mobile phones – one to contact each of them, with Sahar kept in his address book as 'R2' – and lived a ‘double life’.

The inquest also heard that an intimate video of Miss Daftary and Mr Jamil had been circulated on YouTube.

Mr Jamil told police he had separated from his wife and had moved out of the £800,000 family home and into the exclusive NV Buildings in Salford Quays.

But he said that problems began to arise when Miss Daftary started ‘demanding more from the relationship.’

He then told her that he no longer wanted to be with her and that 'life goes on'.

During this time, he said, he was using cocaine around three times a week.

He also claimed that Miss Daftary had taken an overdose in the Lowry Hotel in Manchester and tried to self-harm in his flat.

Miss Daftary was due to go to Mr Jamil’s 12th-floor flat to collect her belongings on December 20, 2008.

He picked her up in his car and during the journey she repeatedly asked him to divorce his wife and to collect his own belongings from the family home, Mr Jamil said.

He added: ‘I was just trying to keep her calm. She was out of control.’

Mr
Jamil was also frantically trying to contact two escorts who were 
living in his flat to try to get them to leave before he arrived.

They were still there when he got back, which upset Miss Daftary, but left shortly after.

Former escort Lauren Penney, a glamour 
model and make-up artist, said in a statement: 'I was very surprised and
shocked that this woman we didn’t know was so angry towards us.'

Mr Jamil said he and Sahar kissed on the couch watching 'Mr and Mrs' before they went on to the balcony.

The inquest in Bolton listened to interviews he gave detectives as he told them how he and Miss Daftary argued as they stood on the balcony:

He explained: 'I said, "I want you in my life, but I can't do this." She said, "Where does that leave me?" I said, "I think you know".'

He said he told her it was 'not morally right' for him to leave his wife.

Mr Jamil said she asked him: 'Can you live without me?' He said she started crying after he replied: 'It will be hard, but life goes on.'

He told police: 'I said, "Just come here". I had my back to her. She said "Rash, remember what you said, life goes on". I heard her scream. I instantly froze.

'She wasn't on the balcony. I looked over and I could see her on the floor. I ran out of the apartment, got in the lift and went down.'

The court heard he rang his wife as Sahar was being placed in the ambulance and said: 'Get over here. I need you.'

He added: 'Any normal man would say it was fine to have two women in your life. It was fine until my wife found out about it.

'Sahar started demanding more from the relationship and that's when the problems started.'

Rose-Marie Turner, who lived in the flat below, told the inquest she heard a heated argument that night, adding: ‘It sounded really intense and they were going at each other.’

A few moments later she heard a scream and then another sharper scream before seeing what looked like a shadow pass her window.

Miss Turner also said that it would have been difficult to climb over the glass railing on the balcony and she believed the couple were having a physical fight rather than just an argument.

The hearing in Bolton continues.
