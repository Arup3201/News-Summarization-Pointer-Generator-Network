The husband suspected of drowning his wife during a honeymoon scuba dive
in Australia was actually trying to save her when she became distressed
underwater, a physician told a court today.

Gabe Watson, 34, wrapped his arms around his wife Tina Watson moments 
before she sank to the ocean's bottom in 2003, said Dr Stanley Stutz, an
emergency room physician from Chicago, Illinois.

But prosecutors contend Dr Stutz witnessed the woman's murder on the 
Great Barrier Reef - and another witness on the trip said he never 
believed the husband's story about what happened.

Dr Stutz said he was in the water with about three dozen other divers 
when he looked down and saw Mrs Watson floating on her back with her 
arms extended, moving slowly in the water.

‘I was close enough to see her face,’ Dr Stutz told the court in 
Birmingham, Alabama, adding that Mrs Watson seemed distressed but wasn't
thrashing and moved like she ‘had no energy’.

Jurors listened intently on Thursday while Dr Stutz testified. Their 
perceptions of his story could be vital to the outcome of Watson's 
capital murder trial at the Mel Bailey Criminal Justice Center.

A man Dr Stutz said he now knows was Gabe Watson swam to the woman from 
the front, extended both of his arms under her armpits and lingered 
momentarily, the doctor said.

‘Then they split apart,’ Dr Stutz said. ‘After, he went to the surface. 
She sank.’ The woman was clearly alive before the encounter - but she 
was dying afterward, he told the court.

But prosecutors claim Watson turned off his wife's air supply and let 
her lose consciousness or get distressed before approaching her again, 
turning on her air to cover up murder, and letting her sink.

They contend Dr Stutz saw Watson during the final scene of a murderous 
act - but yet he told the court he didn't think anything sinister had 
happened at first.

Under cross examination, he said he believed Watson was attempting to 
help the woman. ‘I thought Gabe was trying to save her,’ he said. ‘I was
surprised when I got an email that it was a murder trial.’

Testimony: Diving expert Kenneth Snyder speaks at the Gabe Watson trial in Alabama on Thursday

Evidence showed Watson was certified as a rescue diver in 1999, about 
four years before his wife drowned in October 2003. She was a novice 
diver, the court heard.

Her scuba gear sat in a pile on a table at the front of the courtroom 
during testimony, just a few feet from Watson at the defence table. He 
has since remarried and has been at court this week with his second wife, Kim Lewis.

The defence claims Mrs Watson panicked during the dive and knocked off 
her husband's mask and air supply, forcing him to surface for help 
because the current had carried her away from him.

A master diver on the trip, Kenneth Snyder of Estero, Florida, said he 
and his wife talked with a bubbly Mrs Watson and her husband on their 
boat, the Spoilsport, before divers went in the water.

Later, he said, he saw Watson board the Spoilsport alone and went to 
talk to him. ‘I asked Gabe where Tina was at. He said: “She didn't come 
up”,’ Mr Snyder said.

'That's bulls**t. That didn't happen'

Mr Snyder added that he soon saw Mrs Watson's body being taken out of 
the water and placed on the deck of another boat, Jazz II, which was 
about 100ft away.

Watson didn't try to get to the Jazz II while others were trying to revive his wife, Mr Snyder said.

Mr Snyder added that he asked Watson what had happened underwater and 
immediately disbelieved the man's claim that his wife had panicked and 
knocked off his gear.

Mr Snyder said he told Watson: ‘That's bulls**t. That didn't happen.’ Mr Snyder said a friend told Watson the same thing.

Earlier, Mr Snyder said a rescuer only must press a single button on a 
distressed diver's gear to fill a bladder with air and send the other 
person to the surface.

‘It will save their life?’ asked prosecutor Don Valeska. ‘Absolutely,’ replied Mr Snyder.

Prosecutors argue that Watson killed the woman hoping to collect some 
$210,000 in insurance benefits and her diamond engagement ring, but the 
defence maintains her death was an accident.

Watson served 18 months in prison in Australia after pleading guilty to a
manslaughter charge in his wife's death. The charge involved 
negligence, not premeditated murder like the Alabama charge.
