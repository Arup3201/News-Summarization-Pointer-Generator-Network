If you've ever struggled to make a call where there is no phone signal, one enterprising hacker may have the answer.

German inventor Dennis de Bel says his invention could lead to a resurgence in the ancient art.

He boasted the technique is NSA-proof, and free to use.

The new SMS: The German Smoke Messaging Service can send smoke signals from your phone

Before use, the user must place the lamp oil into the vaporiser.

This is then heated and vaporized, sending a little cloud of smoke up in the air right in front of the phone's camera.

Later versions will be able to 'read' the messages using the camera.

Users have to work out their own code.

Three puffs is 'hello,' 5 puffs is 'hello, I'm coming home later, according to the system's inventor.

He revealed the project at a recent Berlin art show.

'S.M.S. or Smoke Messaging Service, takes your device to the next level,' he said

'Based on millennia of experience this iPhone hardware addon offers you safe, long distance, visual communication for free!

'Smoke is one of the earliest technologies for long distance visual communication - this iPhone addon offers you the advantages of ancient technology TODAY!'

At the push of a button, lamp-oil is heated and vaporized, sending a little cloud of smoke up in the air right in front of the phone's camera.

'This cloud could potentially be picked up by the camera and translated in real-time,' De Bel told Vice.

'But, that is for later implementation'

The system also relies on the two participants knowing the code for signals.

'For example, three puffs is 'hello,' 5 puffs is 'hello, I'm coming home later,' said De Bel.

A button on the side of the device is currently used to control the smoke signal - future versions could use an app

Before use, the user must place the lamp oil into the vaporiser.

The first known use of smoke signals is in Ancient China, where soldiers stationed along the Great Wall would alert each other of impending enemy attack by signaling from tower to tower.

Greek historian Polybius, came up with a more complex system of alphabetical smoke signals around 150 BC,converting Greek alphabetic characters into numeric characters so they can be hidden in pairs - an encryption technique known as as the 'Polybius square' which was used by Germans in the later years of the First World War.

The North American indigenous peoples also communicated via smoke signal, with each tribe having its own signaling system and understanding.

They are still in use today by the College of Cardinals to revealÂ  the selection of a new Pope.
