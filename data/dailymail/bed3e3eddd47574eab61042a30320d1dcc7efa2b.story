Environment Agency chairman Chris Smith said flooding is getting worse because of a 'new kind of rain'

Britain's worsening floods are caused by a 'new kind of rain', according to the head of the Environment Agency.

Chairman Lord Smith says changes in rain patterns mean parts of the country are being hit by prolonged downpours that are causing extreme flooding.

Thousands of homes and businesses were damaged and at least eight people were killed in 2012 as Britain suffered its second wettest year on record.

Lord Smith told the Sunday Telegraph that changes in the way it rains have contributed to the severe floods, in a claim reminiscent of British Rail's 'wrong type of snow excuse'.

He said: 'Instead of rain sweeping across the country, we are getting convective rain, which sits in one place and just dumps itself in a deluge over a long period of time.

‘From the point of view of filling up the rivers and the drains, that it is quite severe.’

Groundwater remains too high across Britain and further heavy rain could see more flooding.

However, the record-breaking rain of the past 12 months means there is no chance of a drought in 2013.

He told the Sunday Telegraph: 'If there was not another drop of rain for the whole of the rest of this year we would survive, but we would be seriously worried.'

He said warnings of more extreme weather in the future means there is a 'constant' need to improve defences.

Former culture secretary Lord Smith was speaking 60 years after the Great Floods, which killed 307 people along the east coast.

Coastal towns and villages in Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Kent and Lincolnshire were severely hit by the North Sea storms.

In Canvey Island, Essex, alone about 13,000 people had to be evacuated and 59 people were killed.

Heavy floods hit many parts of the UK last year, such as Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, pictured, as the country suffered its second wettest year in history

Lord Smith said the country needs to be vigilant about flooding and defences must be upgraded in parts

Lord Smith said flood defences have improved dramatically since then and stand two metres higher  than they did in 1953.

However, he said with the country facing rising sea levels over the next 50 years, defences need constantly upgrading.

Despite these warnings the Environment Agency has seen a 27 per cent funding cut since the Coalition came to power in 2010.

Although, Lord Smith said the severe weather of 2012 has pushed floods higher up the list of Government priorities.
