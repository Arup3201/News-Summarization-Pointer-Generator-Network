A couple who hid the horrific injuries they inflicted on their baby daughter by switching her with her identical twin were jailed yesterday.

Mohammed and Nafisa Karolia fooled health visitors by making a series of excuses for only one child being at home at any one time.

The baby – known as Twin M – suffered broken ribs, legs, arms, brain damage, and damage to her head, ears and nose during her seven months of life.

The injuries were inflicted on at least three separate occasions and some were six weeks old or more.

No attempt was made to seek medical 
attention and Twin M later died of an unrelated illness. The couple, who
were convicted of child cruelty in July, were given five-year prison 
terms.

Passing sentence yesterday, Mr Justice Irwin said: ‘What emerges from the evidence is repeated cruelty to one child.

‘The surviving twin has never suffered any injury or neglect and appeared to be very well cared for.’

Preston Crown Court heard that when 
health visitors called, Nafisa, 22, – who was on a child studies course –
and Mohammed, 29, a taxi driver, deliberately concealed the injured 
twin. Often they would claim she was with her grandparents or other 
relatives.

A social worker was also duped when she called at the family home in Blackburn, being told that Twin A was Twin M.

Joe Boyd, prosecuting, said the 
injuries must have been caused by the parents because Twin M was away 
from their care for only a few hours of her short life.

In June last year, the child was taken
to hospital with breathing difficulties and pronounced dead an hour 
later. At the hospital, the Karolias claimed the dead girl was actually 
Twin A.

Their story unravelled when a social worker noticed discrepancies in head, weight and height measurements.

A post-mortem examination revealed more than 20 injuries to the baby girl and found that she died from bronchopneumonia.

Detective Inspector Pete Broome of 
Lancashire Police said: ‘This was a truly horrific and tragic crime 
committed by two parents who have shown no remorse for their actions  
and have failed to offer any sort of explanation for what they did.’
