The Clock Tower, which houses Big Ben, has been renamed the Elizabeth Tower in honour of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee

The historic clock tower that houses Big Ben was yesterday renamed the ‘Elizabeth Tower’ in honour of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.

Commons Speaker John Bercow presided over a formal ceremony after the majority of MPs backed a Daily Mail campaign for the name change.

The move, which is understood to have delighted the Queen, means one of Britain’s best-known landmarks will forever carry her name.

It mirrors a tribute bestowed on Queen Victoria, the only other monarch to remain on the throne for 60 years. The tower at the other end of the Palace of Westminster was renamed the Victoria Tower to mark her long reign.

The tower is known across the world by the name of the bell it houses - Big Ben - and MPs accept it will continue to be referred to by that name by most. Previously, the tower was officially known as the Clock Tower,

In the official naming ceremony at the foot of the tower, Mr Bercow said it was a ‘special and heart-warming’ occasion.

‘Everyone here present will speedily recall that Her Majesty the Queen has visited Parliament on no fewer than three occasions in this, a very special year, and it is a mark and symbol of the enormous affection and esteem in which Her Majesty is held by people of all political persuasions and none that this renaming has taken place.’

Tory MP Tobias Ellwood, who tabled a Commons motion collecting names of MPs supporting the measure, including David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg, said: ‘Only two monarchs since William the Conqueror have actually served this country so diligently and selflessly for 60 years - that’s quite an incredible task considering the number of monarchs this country has seen - Queen Victoria and now Queen Elizabeth II.

‘She has served this country in such esteem - that was recognised this year with the celebrations that were seen.

‘She is one of the most respected public figures in the world. She reminds us who we are, what we are about and what it is to be British and it is a very proud day indeed to see this clock tower renamed in recognition of the work she has done.’
