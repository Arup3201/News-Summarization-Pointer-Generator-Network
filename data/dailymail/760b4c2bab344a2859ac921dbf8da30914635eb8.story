The U.S. has considered building a fence along its northern border with Canada to keep out terrorists and other criminals, it has emerged.

A Customs and Border Protection Agency report suggested ‘fencing and other barriers’ along the ‘longest non-militarised open border in the world’.

But the U.S. agency has since said it is more concerned about considering the environmental effects of building more infrastructure along the border.

A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman said it is not considering the fence option ‘at this time’, reported The Canadian Press.

Its report released last month in Washington D.C. was intended to look at how to tighten the border with Canada to improve security.

The study looked at the environmental effects if more manpower, technology, and infrastructure were created at the border.

It comes as Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and U.S. President Barack Obama try to close in on an effective border security deal.

Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has been pushing for more manpower along the border, reported the International Business Times.

The border land ranges from dense forest to open plains to the Great Lakes - and most of it is sparsely populated, the report said.

Far less ‘illegal incursions’ happen than at the Mexico border - but ‘attempts at illegal immigration and smuggling regularly occur’ there.

Border Patrol agents along the northern border have increased by 700 per cent since 9/11, reported the International Business Times.

The report looked at the 6,437km border from Maine to Washington - ignoring Alaska - and improving U.S. ‘tactical security infrastructure.’

It considered more barriers, access roads and other facilities - including ‘selective fencing and vehicle barriers at selected points’.

The report also looked at ‘remediation of tunnels as they are discovered,’ reported Postmedia News on the Montreal Gazette.
