Independence plans: Alex Salmond, pictured at a Scottish storytelling centre on the 253rd anniversary of the birth of Robert Burns, outlined his plans for a referendum in 2014

Alex Salmond unveiled his plans for a referendum on Scottish independence yesterday – publishing a question which critics said was ‘loaded’ and designed to destroy the Union.

Scotland’s First Minister outlined a timetable which could see an end to the 300-year Union of England and Scotland by 2016.

But his plans immediately caused controversy since they appeared designed to subvert the usual democratic safeguards over referendums – or to spark a row with London which would also boost the Scottish National Party’s chances of a Yes vote.

Mr Salmond said Scottish voters would go to the polls in 2014 – the 700th anniversary of the Scottish victory over the English at the Battle of Bannockburn. They would be asked: ‘Do you agree that Scotland should be an independent country?’

He said he would allow 16 and 17 year olds to vote, a proposal that contravenes UK election law and is designed to boost support from pro-independence teenagers.

The SNP leader also said that if the Scottish public demands it, he is prepared to sanction a second question on the ballot paper on whether Scotland wants beefed up devolution, known as ‘devo max’.

Most controversially, Mr Salmond attempted to bypass the usual procedure for holding a referendum in which the Electoral Commission, which helps to run the vote, has to sanction the question as fair.

Mr Salmond made clear that he only regards the watchdog’s role as consultative rather than binding, allowing him alone to decide how the question is ultimately phrased.

He told Scottish MPs the question that would be put to voters would be ‘short, straightforward and clear’.

Mr Salmond said: ‘Independence, in essence, is based on a simple idea: the people who care most about Scotland, that is the people who live, work and bring up their families in Scotland, should be the ones taking the decisions about our nation’s future.’

A simple question: Alex Salmond told MSPs he wants the referendum question to be: 'Do you agree your country should be independent?'

But former Labour Chancellor Alistair 
Darling said: ‘The question is loaded. He is inviting people to endorse 
the separation of a successful independent nation. He is not asking if 
you want to remain part of the United Kingdom, which I would prefer.

‘It is asking for trouble and if he 
tries to push through unfair wording someone will go to court. It’s 
typical of Salmond who wants to call the shots on the rules, the 
conduct, the wording and ultimately what the result means.’

Ministers viewed the wording of the 
question as unfair and liable to encourage a Yes vote – speculating that
Mr Salmond wants to pick a fight.

One Westminster source said: ‘This is 
all about Salmond turning around and saying: “Look at all those dreadful
people in London trying to tell us what to do.”’

A Downing Street official added: ‘Alex
Salmond doesn’t have the power to set out the question. These are his 
proposals and they will feed into our consultation. But he doesn’t have 
the power to legally set up a referendum.

‘The Electoral Commission should play 
their usual role in the referendum and that means scrutinising the 
question. They are officially part of the process. That is mentioned in 
our own consultation document.’ Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said 
the Government would block any bid to introduce a devo max question.

England will be better without us: Mr Salmond speaking during the Hugo Young Lecture at King's Place, London, on Tuesday night

‘Any attempt to pass legislation for 
either an independence or devo max referendum would be outside the 
existing powers of the Scottish Parliament and liable to legal 
challenge,’ he said. ‘We have made it clear that we think the Scottish 
Government would lose such a challenge.’

Mr Salmond also faced ridicule 
yesterday after admitting that the Bank of England would have to bail 
out an independent Scotland if it got into financial trouble.

He conceded that the final say on 
financial policy would be left with the Bank, which would act as lender 
of last resort if an independent Scotland were to retain the pound.
