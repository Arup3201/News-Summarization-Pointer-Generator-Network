A Detroit house that was turned into an art installation has been burned to the ground - the sixth home in the beloved Heidelberg Project to be attacked by arsonists since May.Â 

The home, called 'Party Animal' or 'Doll House' was adorned with stuffed animals and dolls by artist Tyree Guyton, who has been decorating vacant homes in run-down neighborhoods of the decaying city since 1986.

Arson investigator Lieutenant Joseph Crandall says crews responded at 3am Friday to the blaze that ultimately burned the house to the ground.

The wood-frame house was quickly 
engulfed in flames and firefighters said there was nothing they could do
 to save it by the time they arrived.

No injuries were reported in the fire, but a house next door was damaged.

The Heidelberg Project homes have become a city landmark, visited by residents and tourists alike, who visit the art exhibition that sprawls across a neighborhood on Detroit's east side, according to the Detroit News.

Each house is a different theme and all of them are decorated by found objects.

Not everyone likes the project.

Since May, seven Heidelberg homes have been hit by eight different fires. Counting Friday's Doll House, six have burned to the ground.

Detroit police and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives believe arson is to blame in all of the fires.

The first house hit was 'Obstruction of Justice' last May. Then in November, 'House of Soul,' 'The Penny House' and 'War House' were all burned to the ground. 'Clock House' was torched in December.

'There just aren't words for this. Party Animal is gone. Please send us your love today,' the Heidelberg Project tweeted.

This isn't the first time that the artist's installations have been destroyed. In 1991 and again in 1999, two different mayoral administrations ordered six houses featuring Tyree Guyton's work to be demolished because the buildings were derelict.

Some neighbors don't like the art project - they say the decorated homes attract a lot of unwanted traffic to the neighborhood - tourists from the suburbs and even from out-of-town.
