A college freshman is suing a Georgia school district after a photo of her in a bikini was used in a seminar on the dangers of social media, without her permission.

Chelsea Chaney says the photo had been taken from her private Facebook page and used for a seminar called Once It's There, It's There to Stay', without her being informed.

'I was embarrassed. I was horrified. It never crossed my 
mind that this would ever, ever happen to me,' she said.

Embarrassed: College freshman Chelsea Chaney claims her complaint  was not taken seriously

Fayette County Schools director of technology used the Facebook photograph during a district-wide seminar to inform parents 
and students about the dangers of posting pictures on social media sites, according to WSBTV.

The college student and her family claim that when they approached the school district to complain, they were not taken seriously.

The Chaneys claim that after trying to come to a solution with the school district they were forced to hire an attorney.

Chelsea added that she felt she needed a more sincere apology.

'I wish this had never happened,' the University of Georgia freshman said. 'I cried a lot. It made my first semester a lot harder.'

The photograph was taken on a family holiday and Chelsea believed it was only available to be viewed by friends on Facebook.

In a written apology to the Chelsea, the school district apologized and said the picture had been chosen at random.

'Their idea that putting something on 
Facebook gives them a license to steal it and do with 
it what they did is wrong ethically, it's wrong morally and it's 
absolutely wrong legally,' her attorney Pete Wellborn said.

He added that the school had used the picture to 'suggest that Chelsea is a promiscuous, abuser of alcohol'.

The family are suing for $2 million because they say they want their complaint to be taken seriously.

A school district spokesman said they were unable to comment on litigation but did not believe there was any legal liability.

According to WSBTV the school has filed a motion to have the case dismissed.
