A man has been arrested on suspicion of robbery in connection with a 93-year-old widower being mugged for five pounds outside his home. 

Pensioner Stanley Evans, who lives on his own, was left lying on the floor for 10 minutes after being targeted as he returned from a shopping trip in London.

Police yesterday released CCTV footage of the robbery and assault, which a senior officer branded 'totally unprovoked, callous and sickening'.

Officers confirmed today that a 29-year-old man had been arrested in Camberwell, south London, in connection with the incident. He remains in police custody. 

Victim Stanley Evans says he was left 'flailing like a seal' on the ground for 10 minutes after the attack

Mr Evans was left lying on the ground for 10 minutes before he managed to get to his flat and raise the alarm

Mr Evans - a retired cameraman who worked on films including the 1947 classic Brighton Rock with Richard Attenborough - said he was left 'flailing like a seal' after the incident. 

Describing it, Mr Evans said: 'I've gone past anger, I'm frustrated. If I ever came across that one again I was a boxer and aggressive, if someone punches me I punch them back.

'When you fall over at my age every bit of your body hits the ground, I was flailing like a seal. It's almost impossible to pick yourself up.

'I waited 10 minutes for someone to come but nobody did. Then I managed to struggle to my feet and go up to my flat and call the police.'

The incident took place at Ingestre Court, central London at around 8pm on Saturday, January 31.

Mr Evans, originally from Cardigan in Wales, once worked as an assistant cameraman at Welwyn Studio, where his first feature was John Boulting's 1947 adaptation of Brighton Rock, starring Richard Attenborough, before moving to MGM Studios in Borehamwood.

After the film studio closed down in the 1970s he set up as a freelance photographer in a studio in Marshall Street in Soho, where he captured celebrities including Michael Crawford.

He is determined not to let the incident scare him out of leaving his flat and enjoying Soho where he has lived and worked in for so many years.

He said: 'It doesn't scare me though. I'm not going to hide away in my flat.'

The CCTV footage released by police shows Mr Evans being followed by a man as he returns from the shops into the block of flats where he lives.

Pushing a small shopping trolley, the frail victim is seen waiting in a communal entrance for the lift to his flat as the robber approached him.

The assault happened as the pensioner was waiting for a lift to his flat in Ingestre Court in central London

The attacker is then accused of grabbing his pocket and pushing him to the floor.

The footage shows the shocked pensioner collapsed in the communal area as he waits for help to come.

As a result of the incident, Mr Evans suffered a shoulder injury, which was treated by an ambulance crew.

Detective Sergeant Gemma Alger of the Westminster Serious Crime Unit said: 'This is a totally unprovoked, callous and sickening assault on a defenceless pensioner.

'The victim is fiercely independent and has lived in London all his life. His confidence has been eroded as a result of the actions of this individual and now he is fearful about going out.

'I would urge anyone who has any information on who was responsible to contact us as soon as possible.'
