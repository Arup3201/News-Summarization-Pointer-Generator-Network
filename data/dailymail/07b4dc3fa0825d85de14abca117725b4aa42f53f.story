A school sandwich was thrown at Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard today for the second time this month - and this time it hit her.

The salami sandwich on white bread struck Miss Gillard on the arm when she visited a school in Canberra.

But she laughed off the incident later, declaring: 'The child who threw it must have thought I was hungry.'

Target: Australia's Prime Minister Julia Gillard had a school sandwich thrown at her for the second time this month

Earlier this month a Vegemite sandwich was tossed at - and missed - the Prime Minister when she was visiting a school in Queensland.

The contents of the sandwich thrown today has sparked widespread debate on social media, with some observers asking why the parents of the culprit - who has yet to be identified - had prepared such a non-nutritious sandwich.

But others said more expense had gone into the making of the sandwich as salami would have cost more than a spread of vegemite.

Miss Gillard's security team and photographers surrounded the missile as it lay splattered at the Prime Minister's feet during her visit to Lyneham High School.

She was walking through the foyer, filled with excited schoolchildren who were calling her name and trying to shake her hand, when the sandwich was lobbed from the back of the group and, said witnesses, struck her on the arm.

She did not react at the time but joked later with the remark about the child who threw it probably thinking she was hungry.

The salami sandwich attack happened weeks after another flying sandwich narrowly missed Julia Gillard

Incident earlier this month: The missile - believed to contain Vegemite - didn't hit Labour leader 
Julia Gillard but it landed with a plop on the ground near her when she 
was mobbed by the students in Queensland

The Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory, Katy Gallagher, also made light of the incident, saying that 'schools are full of kids and kids occasionally do silly things.'

She added: 'Occasionally you're going to get a rogue student.

'From what I saw, and I was squashed in the crowd, it was a really excited student population eager to talk with the Prime Minister and she was very generous with her time.'

While the school declined to comment pending an investigation, principal Colleen Matheson gave one student a severe dressing down, although the matter was apparently unrelated to the sandwich throwing.

Miss Matheson was heard telling the student: 'I've already been humiliated by one child today - don't let it happen with another.'
