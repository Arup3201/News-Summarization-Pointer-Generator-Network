A bored student baker has been slotting dark haiku poems into packets of cakes and cookies at a north London Sainsbury's store. 

The mystery poet - who penned the three line, 17 syllable Japanese-style poems - was working at the Sainsbury's Local, in Mornington Crescent, when he slipped the notes into around 20 packets of Taste the Difference treats.

Shoppers were stunned to discover the slips of paper, which were signed: 'A Haiku, by The Bored Baker.'

One reads: 'Enjoy your cookies. Every bite is a minute. I’ll never get back.'

In another, he writes: 'Taste the difference. I can’t taste the difference. Maybe it’s my fault.

In a dark twist, another of the poems reads: 'Been sneezing all day. Good thing HIV cannot. Be passed on like that.'

Student Gary Hernandez  found the note in a packet of Taste the Difference chewy granola slices.

But Sainsbury's have assured shoppers that they have investigated and that this was an isolated incident at the Mornington Crescent store (pictured)

The
 24-year-old told the Sun newspaper that he had complained to the 
supermarket giant after discovering them in the packet, bought from the 
Mornington Crescent store.

He said: 'It was tasteless.' 

Twitter users claim to have found the sinister poems as far afield as Clapham and Portland Street.

But Sainsbury's have assured shoppers that they have investigated and that this was an isolated incident.

A spokesman said: 'As soon as we realised one of our bakers had been putting notes in a small number of cookies, we immediately checked them and withdrew them from sale.

'Obviously this should never have happened and we apologise to anyone who was affected.'

The baker has since left to concentrate on his studies, and is said to have carried out the prank on his last day at the store.
