Guilty: Fatimah Ahmed, pictured at Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court, has quit her job

A maths teacher has avoided jail for hiding £7,000 of her husband's drug money in her bank account.

Fatimah Ahmed, 30, was arrested after police found cocaine and cannabis worth up to £6,000 in a raid on the home she shared with Mohazzam Ali in Stockport, Greater Manchester.

The scandal cost her her job at Poynton High School, Cheshire.

Police raided the house in November 2011 after they learned Ali - who has admitted five drugs offences - was dealing Class A drugs while running a car wash.

Officers seized large quantities of snap bags, digital scales, 
grinders and about £600 in cash.

Ali's then-girlfriend Ahmed, who has since married and had a child with him, was initially charged with drug dealing and suspended from her job at Poynton High School.

She then resigned in December last year during a disciplinary hearing.

It emerged Ahmed had been teaching 
despite being convicted of three thefts, for which she received a conditional discharge in 2003.

But prosecutors dropped charges of drug dealing against her after accepting her guilty plea to laundering £7,000.

Ahmed was given 18 weeks' jail suspended for two years - after a judge told her to 'go back' and look after her and Ali’s baby daughter.

Prosecutor Saul Brody told Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court: 'The address was a property owned by this defendant and her then boyfriend and now husband.

'There was a strong smell of cannabis when they attended. It is fair to say that the usual paraphernalia was discovered in various locations around the house - two bedrooms and the living room.

'There were also a variety of controlled drugs of various classes. There was cannabis, cocaine and ecstasy-type substances. The total value of the drugs was about £4-6,000.

'At that stage both were arrested and charged with drug matters. The evidence on drugs matters in relation to this defendant was not compelling but evidence relating to the financial aspect is as her bank account shows unidentified payments on a fairly significant basis.

Partners in crime: The court heard Mohazzam Ali (left) was the 'drugs person' and Ahmed (right) was the 'money person'. She pleaded guilty but said she did not know the £7,000 in her account had come from crime

'The husband is the drugs person and she is the money person... She may have believed that at some stage there were legitimate payments.'

Michael Knowles, defending, said Ahmed did not know the money had been criminal property.

However, she pleaded guilty to one count of concealing, disguising, converting, transferring or removing criminal property between November 2010 to February 2013.

Her husband pleaded guilty to two counts of possession of class A-C drugs with intent to 
supply and then three counts of possession. He is due to be sentenced next month.

She now faces a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing in June to confiscate the money.

Judge Bernard Lever told Ahmed: 'You on your basis of plea of suspicion rather than knowledge allowed £7,000 to go through your bank account at the behest of your husband and father of your little baby child.

'This was 2011 and you have had to come to court many times. You have pleaded following an indication of a suspended sentence.

Career: Ahmed, 30, taught maths at Poynton High School in Cheshire. She quit during a disciplinary hearing

'In these circumstances everyone agrees that the appropriate sentence is one of imprisonment which you won’t have to serve if you don’t commit further offences.

'You have limited antecedents and have a young baby. Go home and look after your small baby. Keep out of trouble.'

Poynton High head teacher David Waugh said: 'Fatimah Ahmed was suspended from duty following her arrest in November 2011, pending the outcome of the police investigation and legal proceedings.

'She later resigned from her post at the school, in December 2013, during a disciplinary hearing which was being conducted.

'Miss Ahmed’s conduct has brought 
disgrace on herself and besmirched the good reputation and high 
integrity of the teaching profession'

- Poynton High head David Waugh

'Miss Ahmed’s conduct has brought disgrace on herself and besmirched the good reputation and high integrity of the teaching profession.

'Following thorough investigations by the police, school and Local Authority, we are totally confident that the offences were entirely unrelated to the school, its students and the Poynton community and that there are no issues, nor have their ever been, with regard to the health, safety and welfare of our students and staff.

'The school has worked very closely with the support of Cheshire East Council’s human resources team, its legal department and the Local Authority Designated Officer throughout these investigations and legal proceedings.

'Our recent Ofsted inspection also praised Poynton High School unequivocally on safeguarding and protecting the welfare of our students.

'The Ofsted report said that ‘leaders in school are proactive in ensuring that safeguarding measures are strong. Staff work extremely well with parents and outside agencies to make sure students’ welfare needs are met’.

'It also said that ‘substantial evidence provided by the headteacher’ demonstrates that the school has robust systems and procedures which contribute strongly to helping its students stay safe’.

'This school, its staff and governors remain committed to ensuring this ethos is maintained and strengthened. Protecting the welfare of our pupils and helping them achieve their potential is at the core of all that we do.'
