Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand has praised Roy Keane's influence on him at Old Trafford, even though he thought the Irishman was 'nuts' during one of his first training sessions.

Ferdinand joined the Red Devils from Leeds in 2002 and spent over three years playing alongside Keane, winning the Premier League title in his first season with the club.

And although Ferdinand credits Keane with helping him become a success in Manchester, the QPR centre back admits that he was unsure of the midfielder early on.

Keane left Manchester United in 2005 and is now assistant manager at Aston Villa

Appearances: 453

Goals: 8

Honours: Premier League (2003, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2013), FA Cup (2004), League Cup (2006, 2009), Champions League (2008)

Speaking on the sports stage of a web summit in Dublin on Wednesday, Ferdinand said: 'One of my first training sessions after joining (Manchester United), I got the ball, passed it to Gary Neville, and in any world that was a great ball, but Keano turned around and started screaming at me, "Pass it forward, take a risk, you're not at Leeds or West Ham, you're at Man United." And I stood there and thought "This guy is crazy, man, I passed it to a team-mate."'

Despite his initial shock at Keane's reaction, the 35-year-old quickly realised that his new team-mate was only trying to help him get into the mindset of a United player.

He added: 'I went home and thought 'This guy is nuts, how am I going to deal with him on a daily basis.' But then I realised what he said, you've got to start taking risks. He was aggressive in that sense, but I liked that stuff.'
