The throat specialist to the stars who was in attendance during the procedure that led to Joan Rivers’ death is still seeing patients, MailOnline can reveal.

Dr Gwen Korovin, who was reportedly not authorized to practice at Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic in Manhattan where Joan underwent an endoscopy on August 28, is still accepting new patients at her Upper East Side practice.

New York's Department of Health is continuing its investigation into the star's death after Dr Lawrence Cohen, Yorkville's medical director, stepped down from his position at the clinic last month.

And today, a close family friend told MailOnline that Joan's daughter Melissa Rivers does indeed plan to sue the clinic following her mother's death at age 81 on September 4.

Gone too soon: Comic icon Joan Rivers fully expected to exit the Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic after her procedure to meet up with friends. Instead, the 81-year old went into cardiac arrest and died days later

Still working: Dr Gwen Korovin is still working at her Manhattan office. She charges $460 for an initial consultation and does not accept insurance. She is believed to have been in the room at Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic when Joan Rivers went into cardiac arrest on August 28

The friend said: 'Melissa does plan to sue the clinic. It's very difficult to discuss something so unpleasant with her, but she is going to launch a lawsuit. 

Questions from friends and family that have yet to be answered include whether there was actually an anesthesiologist present as Joan underwent the endoscopy. 

CNN reported that a source close to the investigation into Joan's death being carried out by the New York State Department of Health said she suffered a cardiac arrest following the endoscopy as her personal doctor performed an 'unauthorized procedure'.

According to CNN, several clinic workers told investigators the procedure began with Dr Korovin performing a laryngoscopy, which involves using a device to view a patient's vocal folds. 

Dr. Lawrence Cohen, a longtime gastroenterologist, then performed an endoscopy to diagnose why she was suffering a sore throat and hoarseness, the source said.

It's believed the comedienne had a trans-nasal endoscopy, which feeds a slim tube down the nose, instead of a tube being placed down the throat via the mouth, according to the family friend. 

Dr Cohen detected something of concern and Dr Korovin then began a second laryngoscopy to again view Joan's vocal cords, the source said. It was at that time that her vocal cords began to swell, leading to a cutoff of oxygen to her lungs and ultimately to cardiac arrest, according to the source.

Gone: Gastroenterologist Dr Lawrence Cohen, the medical director of Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic, stepped down from his position. He carried out an endoscopy on Joan Rivers on August 28. It was later reported he had allowed a specialist, who was not authorized to practice at the clinic, to examine the star

The clinic, however, denies reports that a vocal cord biopsy was performed moments before Joan went into cardiac arrest.

Paramedics then rushed the star from Yorkville Endoscopy to New York's Mount Sinai Hospital a mile away, where she was kept on life support until she died a week later.

Dr Korovin - who charges $460 for an initial consultation and does NOT take insurance - was authorized only to observe Dr Cohen, since she was not certified by Yorkville Endoscopy clinic, as required by New York health law, the source told CNN. 

Dr Korovin, 56, is an esteemed ear, nose and throat specialist who counts Hugh Jackman, Julie Andrews, Lady Gaga, pop princess Ariana Grande and Celine Dion among her celebrity patients.

Sources close to the specialist have already been forced to deny that Dr Korovin took a 'selfie' picture while Joan was under anesthesia.

Famous clientele: Dr Gwen Korovin, who was in the room when Joan Rivers underwent her ill-fated procedure, counts Celine Dion as one of her patients. In the singer's 2010 documentary, Dr Korovin performs a laryngoscopy on the star and they talk about her resting her vocal chords

Dr. Korovin's  lawyer, Michael Kelton, released a statement to MailOnline, saying:  'Gwen S. Korovin, M.D. is a highly experienced, board certified otolaryngologist. She maintains privileges at one of the city's most prestigious hospitals. She is respected and admired by her peers in the medical community and she is revered by her patients.

'As a matter of personal and professional policy, Dr. Korovin does not publicly discuss her patients or their care and treatment. Further, Dr. Korovin is prohibited by state and federal confidentiality laws from discussing her care and treatment of any particular patient.

'For these reasons, neither Dr. Korovin nor her attorneys will have any public comment on recent press reports regarding her practice. We ask that the press please respect Dr. Korovin's personal and professional policy of not discussing her patients, as well as the privacy of her patients.'

Today, Mr Kelton's office declined to comment on whether Dr Korovin was still at work.  

Meanwhile, the New York Medical Examiner's Office has yet to release the exact cause of death for Joan Rivers.
