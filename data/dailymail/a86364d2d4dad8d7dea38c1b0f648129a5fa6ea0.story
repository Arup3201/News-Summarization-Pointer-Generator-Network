Demand for properties which cost £1million a year to rent is soaring amid growing concerns about mansion tax and stamp duty, according to a new report.

The £1million-plus rental market has boomed since 2010, when two large penthouses were let out in Mayfair, London.

Since then, the market has grown across the capital to include properties in Knightsbridge, Chelsea, South Kensington, Notting Hill, Regent's Park, St John's Wood and Holland Park.

The average weekly rent in London's ultra-prime lettings market is now £3,500 per week or £182,000 per year.

One exclusive six-bedroom mansion (pictured), situated next door to the Qatari Royal Family in Westminster's Cornwall Terrace - known as the most expensive terrace in the world - is currently on the market for a whopping £960,000 a year. The luxury property's deposit alone is £260,000

The Cornwall Terrace ambassadorial-style property, with large sweeping rooms, measures 8,883 sq. ft and is finished to a high specification

It is a 23 per cent rise on five years ago and is more than the average price paid last month for a home in England and Wales.

Across Central London, the average rent paid in the third quarter of 2014 was 6.5 per cent higher than 12 months earlier - the highest rate of growth for more than three years.

The luxury houses tend to be let by Africans, Middle East tenants and Russians, who have made their wealth from oil, gas, investments or commodity trading.

Apartments and penthouses tend to be let by UK, North American, Continental European and Asian households.

It is now thought the number of people looking to rent high-end properties rather than buy could increase even further.

An undersupply of luxury properties and concerns about the 2015 election, the proposed mansion tax and the recent Stamp Duty changes are driving the wealthy into the rental market, according to a new report by Beauchamp Estates and Dataloft, the market intelligence group.

Gary Hersham, managing director of Beauchamp, is currently looking to let a six-bedroom mansion next door to the Qatari Royal Family in Cornwall Terrace - which overlooks Regent's Park and is known as the most expensive terrace in the world.

The 8,883 sq. ft. ambassadorial-style home is on the rental market for £960,000 per year with any prospective tenant having to stump up a £260,000 deposit.

The five-bedroom property in Knightsbridge, which is on the rental market for £768,000 per year, boasts its own swimming pool and jacuzzi

Mr Hersham also has a five-bedroom property in Knightsbridge on the rental market for £768,000 per year. It boasts a swimming pool and jacuzzi and requires an £85,000 deposit.

He said: 'Concerns over a change of government, the mansion tax debate and now Stamp Duty changes have led high-net-worth-individuals to decide to rent for the next 12 months and delay purchase plans.

'This might cost a client up to £1 million, but this is less than a £25 to £100 million outlay for an ultra-prime property.

'Whilst the ultra-prime lettings market has boomed during 2014 the equivalent sales sector has been affected by the uncertainty in the market caused by the pending general election and the issues over the Mansion Tax.'

Another London agency, Rokstone Properties, is looking to rent out a Mayfair mansion for £576,000 per year.

The five-storey townhouse on Audley Street in Westminster boasts eight bedrooms, five bathrooms, four living rooms and a gym, sauna and plunge pool.

Lottie Henniker-Major, head of lettings at Russell Simpson, said there is currently a lull of available properties which is pushing prices up

Estate agent Russell Simpson also has The Court House available in Chelsea for a whopping £600,000 per year.

Lottie Henniker-Major, head of lettings at Russell Simpson, said there is a lull of available properties which is pushing prices up.

She said: 'There is a distinct shortage of stock in the upper end of the market with no new properties having come on to the market in the £7000 pw+ price bracket in 2015 so far.

'I can only predict that this will lead to a further increase in rental prices moving forward.'
