Apartment-sharing site Airbnb won a huge court battle Tuesday when the New York Supreme Court quashed a subpoena from Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office seeking user's personal information.

'The subpoena at issue, as drafted, seeks materials that are irrelevant
 to the inquiry at hand and accordingly, must be quashed,' wrote acting state 
Supreme Court Justice Gerald Connolly in court papers.

The court granted the site's 'instant application to quash the subpoena as
 overbroad' as well as denying the Attorney General's motion to force them to give out any information or date about their users, according to the The New York Daily News.

The New York Supreme Court has quashed a subpoena from Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office seeking personal information about Airbnb users

Schneiderman's office sought names, addresses, rates, 
tax data of Airbnb's users for the past three years.

'This decision is good news for New Yorkers who simply want to share 
their home and the city they love,' Airbnb spokesman Nick Papas told reporters.

'Now, it’s time for us to work together. Airbnb hosts and the Attorney 
General share a common goal: we all want to make New York a better place
 to live, work and visit. We look forward to continuing to work with the
 Attorney General's Office to make New York stronger for everyone.'

An Attorney General spokesman said that the decision still agreed there was evidence many Airbnb hosts could be violating tax laws.

Finding a silver lining in what many view as a major setback, the Attorney General's office noted that the court sided with Schneiderman on many of his points and that it would reissue a subpoena this week addressing a technical issue.

Among the victories Schneiderman's office is claiming is Connolly's decision that 'Airbnb] has failed to demonstrate that
 the subpoena is unduly burdensome,' and noting that '[t]he record before the Court 
indicates that there are Hosts regularly using their apartments to 
provide lodging to guests who may not be complying with the state and 
local tax registration and/or collection requirements.'

The site called the decision 'good news for New Yorkers who simply want to share their home and the city they love'

Alegislative source speaking to the News said: 'It looks like Airbnb won the battle and lost the war.'

Schneiderman spokesman Matt Mittenthal said that the decision still found evidence many Airbnb hosts could be violating tax laws.

'This comes as no surprise, given that Airbnb itself removed some 2,000 
New York-based listings from its site,' he said. 'Our office is committed to 
enforcing a law that provides vital protections for building residents 
and tourists alike. The judge rejected all of AirBnb’s arguments except 
for a narrow technical issue, and we will reissue the subpoena to 
address it.'
