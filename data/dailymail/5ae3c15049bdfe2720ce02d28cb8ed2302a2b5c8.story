Covered in blood amid a tangled heap of dead mothers and children, 12-year-old Tarana Akbari punctuates the chaotic aftermath of a suicide attack with a scream for help.

When it appeared on the front page of the New York Times, The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times on December 7 2011, this image brought home the bloody reality of a war that has devastated the lives of ordinary people across Afghanistan.

Today it was honoured with a Pulitzer Prize, journalism's highest accolade.

Pulitzer Prize: This image appeared on the front page of the New York Times, The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times on December 7 2011

It was taken by Massoud Hossaini who happened to be covering a Shiite religious ceremony at a shrine in Kabul for Agence France-Presse when the bomb ripped through the crowd. Sixty-three people were killed.

'Women were asking me, "Help, help, help,"' Mr. Hossaini said. 'I 
couldn't. I was recording and I was taking pictures.'

In a statement released by AFP, he added: 'I'm humbled to be an Afghan who can be a voice for the painful life and moments which people have here. I know that whoever sees this photo will think about the photographer but I hope they don't forget the pain Afghanistan's people have in their life.'

Hossaini was handed the award at a ceremony at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism in New York.

He was joined by 24-year-old reporter Sara Ganim of The Patriot-News in Harrisburg, Pa.

She captured the award for local reporting for breaking the Penn State scandal that ultimately brought down Joe Paterno.

Ganim, a police and courts reporter, 
won for 'courageously revealing and adeptly covering the explosive Penn 
State sex scandal,' the Pulitzer judges wrote. At 24, she is one of the 
youngest journalists ever to win a Pulitzer; at least one prior winner, 
Jackie Crosby of the Macon Telegraph and News of Georgia, was 23.

Ganim
 broke the news of the grand jury investigation into allegations against
 former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky. She was also
 the first to report his indictment on charges of molesting several boys
 involved in a charity he ran. Sandusky has denied the allegations.

The
 scandal ended Paterno's lustrous coaching career, prompted the ouster 
of Penn State President Graham Spanier and led to a nationwide 
discussion over the place of big-time sports on college campuses.

Friends: Craig F. Walker of the Denver Post hugs former United States Marine Scott Ostrom the subject of his 2012 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography depicting his struggle with a severe case of post-traumatic stress disorder

Emotional: War veteran Brian Scott Ostrom weeps as he look over his war records after he was honorably discharged from the Marine Corps. It is part of a set shot by Craig F. Walker who won the feature photography prize

Powerful: Ostrom cups his hand over his mouth as he tries to calm a panic attack at his apartment in Boulder. He told Walker that it has been hard to find meaning in his life since 2007

'Better than any award, the most 
rewarding thing through this whole process has been people telling me 
that this story and our coverage has changed their minds about local 
reporting, and we all know that there are a lot of minds yet to change,'
 Ganim said.

The 
Associated Press also won a Pulitzer Prize - its 50th - for 
investigative journalism Monday for revealing the New York Police 
Department's widespread spying on Muslims.

The
 articles showed that police systematically listened in on sermons, hung
 out at cafes and other public places, infiltrated colleges and 
photographed people as part of a broad effort to prevent terrorist 
attacks. Individuals and groups were monitored even when there was no 
evidence they were linked to terrorism.

Poetry: Tracy K. Smith, a creative writing professor at Princeton University, poses in her Brooklyn apartment after winning the Pulitzer Prize for poetry her poetry collection 'Life on Mars'

Books: 'Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention', left, by the late Manning Marable won the prize for History, while "The Swerve: How the World Became Modern," by Stephen Greenblatt, right, won General Nonfiction.

But
 while a host of journalist picked up awards for disciplines including 
investigations, criticism, breaking news and feature writing, fiction 
didn't fare quite so well.

In
 fact, judges decided to withhold the fiction prize for the first time in
 35 years... because none of the books were good enough.

Pulitzer judges had narrowed the field
 to three finalists, including David Foster Wallace's 'The Pale King,' a
 novel assembled from notes he left behind at the time of his suicide in
 2008. Also cited were Karen Russell's 'Swamplandia' and Denis Johnson's
 novella 'Train Dreams.'

'The
 main reason (for the fiction decision) is that no one of the three 
entries received a majority, and thus after lengthy consideration, no 
prize was awarded,' said Sig Gissler, administrator of the Pulitzer 
Prizes. 'There were multiple factors involved in these decisions, and we
 don't discuss in detail why a prize is given or not given.'

Many greeted news about the fiction category as an unpleasant surprise.

Drama: The Tuscaloosa News won a Pulitzer Prize in Breaking News Reporting for their coverage of the April 27, 2011 tornado that destroyed much of Tuscaloosa

'No
 fiction prize!' Jane Smiley, a Pulitzer winner in 1992 for 'A Thousand 
Acres,' wrote on her Facebook page. 'Not even to (Geraldine Brooks') 
'Caleb's Crossing!' I did love that one.'

In
 an email to The Associated Press, Smiley added: 'I can't believe there 
wasn't a worthy one. It's a shame. But sometimes a selection committee 
really cannot agree, and giving no award is the outcome. Too bad.'

The
 Pulitzers have helped canonize such classics as John Updike's 'Rabbit 
at Rest' and Marilynne Robinson's 'Gilead.' The awards also have the 
rare power to transform an obscure literary novel, like the 2010 winner,
 Paul Harding's 'Tinkers,' into an instant best seller.
