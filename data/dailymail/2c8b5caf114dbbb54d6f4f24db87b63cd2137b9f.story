Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri insists he is not disappointed to have missed out on signing Radamel Falcao.

The Colombian forward had been on the Juve radar for the majority of the summer, with the Italian champions looking to bring in another striker after losing new signing Alvaro Morata to a knee injury.

Manchester United announced on Monday they had acquired Falcao on a season-long loan from Monaco, with an option to make the deal permanent next summer.

'We missed out on Falcao? I'm not disappointed,' Allegri said to Turin-based sports newspaper Tuttosport. 'I am satisfied with the transfer market the club has done.

'Juve has made intelligent moves in the transfer market.

'We haven't bought players for the sake of it.'

Elsewhere, in Portuguese newspaper A Bola they report that William Carvalho will be offered a new contract to keep him away from Arsenal and Manchester United.

Spanish publication Mundo Deportivo portray Luis Enrique surrounded by his new signings.

They claim Enrique fought for all of his players this summer, namely Claudio Bravo, Ivan Rakitic, Jeremy Mathieu and Luis Suarez.
