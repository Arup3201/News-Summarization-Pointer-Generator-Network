It was a battle of the giants when a hippo squared up to an elephant as it approached for a drink.

The elephant had invaded the hippopotamus's territory on the Chobe River, in Botswana, and the angry hippo seemed keen to make its feelings clear.

The heavyweight face-off was captured by Nicole Cambre, a 43-year-old lawyer and keen photographer from Brussels.

Standoff: A brave hippo squared up to an enormous African elephant when it approached its territory for a drink

Her pictures show the elephant proudly standing on an island in the river, while the submerged hippo approaches through the water.

When the hippo gets onto the island it does its best to intimidate the unwelcome guest by widening its jaws and bearing teeth.

The elephant lowers its head but the battle is over before it has begun as more elephants arrive and the hippo backs off.

The enormous elephant had been watched by the hippopotamus as it approached the water

Undeterred by the elephant's size it came out from the water to try its chances at scaring the giant animal away

Ms Cambre said: 'There is an island on the middle of the Chobe River to which this elephant had crossed.

The hippo was not happy about it and was apparently defending its territory. When more elephants crossed the river to the island the hippo backed off and went back into the river.'

But even a large teeth-bearing hippo was no match for the elephant and it soon retreated as more elephants arrived
