Actor Rhys Ifans is among a group of six celebrities to have launched phone hacking claims since March

Notting Hill actor Rhys Ifans and television presenter Cilla Black have launched phone hacking damages claims, it emerged today.

News of their legal actions came during the 16th case management conference at the High Court in London relating to claims against News Group Newspapers, which owns The Sun and the now defunct News Of The World.

Two judges heard that since the last hearing in March six new claims had been issued and six others have settled.

Details of the settled cases have yet to be confirmed.

Big Brother former winner Anthony Hutton is among the six newly launched claims.

Cilla Black’s son Robert Willis has also launched a claim.

During the hearing, Dinah Rose QC, for NGN, told Mr Justice Vos and Mr Justice Mann that more than 95 per cent of cases had been settled.

She said the group had acted in accordance with its 'expressed intention' to pay fair and generous compensation to anyone whose phone had been hacked, 'and that is why the overwhelming majority of the claims have been settled'.

Mr Tomlinson said the Met Police have asked for civil disputes linked to Operation Elveden, the probe into corrupt payments by journalists, to be put on hold until live investigations have been resolved.

‘The Met Police is understandably concerned about the case being progressed in this court at this time’, he said.

Ms Rose said News Group will ‘firmly’ opposed Elveden claims and will expose anyone using that legal avenue to their costs if the bid fails. 

‘In relation to voicemail interceptions, News Group said publicly it’s our intention to pay for generous compensation for anyone whose telephones were hacked’, she said.

News Group Newspapers, which owns The Sun, said it has settled more than 95 per cent of cases

‘We are acting in accordance with our express intention.

‘That is not News Group’s position in relation to so-called Elveden claims. 

‘We do not consider these claims to be meritorious and our intention is to resist them.’

Ms Rose said the News Group compensation scheme for victims of phone hacking is still dealing with 200 claims, but has rejected some it deemed to not stand up.

She told the judges that 'unfortunately 
one does have a situation where there are a number of legal firms who 
have done very well indeed out of this litigation', and that there may 
be 'a certain amount of ambulance-chasing going on'.

Hugh Tomlinson QC, who represents the claimant group in the litigation, said there were between five and 10 so-called Operation Elveden claims.

The only claim currently lodged with the court over alleged corrupt payments is from model Sarah Hannon, who featured in a Sun story about an alleged sex act on an airplane.

The former advisor to supermodel Elle MacPherson dropped her phone hacking claim at the High Court last month due to lack of evidence.

She may now face a hefty costs bill from News Group as a result of the aborted litigation. 

A date for trial of any remaining phone hacking claimants who do not settle with the newspaper group could now be heard in 2014, the court heard.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
