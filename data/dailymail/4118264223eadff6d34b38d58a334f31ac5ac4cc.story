Andy Murray is set to miss the opening of his own hotel in Scotland – but will be sending mum Judy along instead.

The 26-year-old bought the Cromlix House Hotel in Perthshire for £1.9million and it is due to open to the public on April 4.

But the tennis star will be busy in Italy, preparing for the Davis Cup quarter final and won’t be able to attend the grand unveiling.

Instead, his mum Judy will be the guest of honour – which is probably fitting considering she has masterminded much of the hotel’s refit.

There has been a lot of attention on the 15-bed hotel, which will have its own Chez Roux restaurant, overseen by Albert Roux, who owns La Gavroche in London – the first British restaurant to win three Michelin stars.

Set in 34 acres of secluded woodland, just five miles from Dunblane, rooms at the grand hotel will cost up to £585 per night in peak season.

It had been reported that Murray would be attending the opening of the hotel, but the tennis star is currently in Miami, where he is the defending champion of the Miami Open.

Having made it through to the third round, after defeating Australian Matthew Ebden, it is hoped he will be in the competition until it ends on March 30, before travelling to Naples for the quarter finals of the Davis Cup.

A spokesperson for the hotel confirmed to the Scottish Daily Record that the sportsman would not be in attendance, stating: ‘Judy will be there but Andy’s not going to be around at the time of the opening.’

The hotel is opening just ahead of the 2014 Ryder Cup, which is being staged in Gleneagles. Which is just a short drive away.

In the family: The estate is where Murray's brother Jamie got married in 2010

Due to the sports competition and interest in the hotel’s owner, the Cromlix has reported strong bookings figures ahead of its opening.

The hotel will be managed on behalf of Murray by Inverlochy Castle Management International, which already runs a series of independent properties in Scotland.

Norbert Lieder, ICMI’s managing director, said: ‘I am confident that, with Andy, we can create a very special hotel in his home community.  While we aim to create a destination that attracts visitors from around the world we are also determined to ensure it remains a venue of choice for local people.’

The hotel was previously in the hands of the Eden family for 30 years and was a popular wedding venue. Murray’s brother Jamie married his Colombian wife Alejandra Gutierrez there in 2010.
