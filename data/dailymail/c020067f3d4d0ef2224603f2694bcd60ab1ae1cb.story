More than 60 per cent of comments on Obamacare's Facebook page have come from fewer than 100 people, a report has revealed.

The site has amassed 226,838 posts since September 2012 - a significant number that has boosted the page in search engines.

But an investigation by the Washington Times has found 136,103 of those were left by a small collection of Facebook users - many of whom have at least three profiles.  

Paid commentators? An investigation has found 60 per cent of  comments left on the Obamacare Facebook page since September 2012 have been left by fewer than 100 people, many of whom have multiple profiles

The revelation came just hours before a poll found Obamacare to be more unpopular than ever, with just 37 per cent support - just as the state and federal health exchanges central to the health care reform law reopen for business. 

Organizing For Action, which runs the Facebook page and Obama's Twitter profile, refused to confirm or deny whether people were paid to comment on the site, the Times said. 

The most prolific commentator on the Obamacare Facebook site, California-based Cyndi Huynh, posted 59 times a day in 60 days.

Her posts came only during working hours and never on weekends, the Times's data analytics team discovered.

Huynh, who has campaigned for the California Democratic Party, told the Times she has a full-time job and does not get paid for her posts but operates under multiple aliases to maximize her influence on the site.

On her LinkedIn page, Huynh describes herself as a Safety and Environmental Compliance Coordinator at production and management company Anonymous Content.

Prolific: Cyndi Huynh once posted 59 times a day for 60 days during working hours and not on weekends

Alias: She admitted to operating under four profiles, including this one, to maximize her influence on the site

And another: This is the third of four profiles she used, but insists she does not get paid for the service

When MailOnline called the Los Angeles Anonymous Content office nobody could verify her claim to work there, and she did not appear on a list of employees.

Obamacare invited Huynh to be a patient advocate but she declined, she told the paper, offering instead to voice her support online.

Other commentators included Wanda Milner, from Canada, who has posted 4,695 times in the last two years.

She told the paper she doesn't have any aliases, does not get paid to comment, and posts because she is passionate about the subject.

A woman named Eileen A. Wolf, of North Dakota, has posted 5,870 times under her own account and that of her husband James Wolf.

Obama came under flak during his campaign for allegedly engaging in 'astroturfing' - where politicians create fake grassroot groups to boost their support.

His campaign manager David Axelrod was widely branded Astroturf Axelrod by political commentators.

Americans looking to purchase health insurance for the upcoming year through the health care marketplace could do so beginning on Saturday.

A Gallup poll released this morning shows that many are none too happy about, however, with just 37 percent of survey-takers saying they approved of the law requiring them to purchase health insurance or be fined by the government if they are not already insured by their employer.
