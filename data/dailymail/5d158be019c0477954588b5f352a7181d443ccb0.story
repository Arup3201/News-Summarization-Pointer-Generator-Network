A decision on changes to the funding of Olympic sports will not be taken until after the general election in May - but could include team sports being funded in a different way.

UK Sport is holding a consultation exercise on changes to its 'no compromise' funding system which funnels public money to those sports winning Olympic and Paralympic medals.

There has been criticism from team sports such as basketball, which now receives no UK Sport money despite being popular in terms of participation, that the system is unfair and favours sports which have many medal chances such as cycling, rowing and swimming.

UK Sport will decide which Olympic sports will receive funding from the public 

Great Britain won 65 medals - 29 of which were gold - during the 2012 Olympic Games in London 

UK Sport's consultation ends on December 10 and its board will then make recommendations to ministers - however it will be the Government that is in power after the general election in May which will make the final decision and changes will be brought in after the Rio 2016 Games.

UK Sport chairman Rod Carr said the organisation firmly believed that its no compromise approach had delivered, with record medal hauls at London 2012 and this year's Sochi winter Olympics but confirmed that a decision to treat team sports differently could emerge as a 'strong' option.

He said: 'It's possible that that will come out as a strong option.

'There is an acceptance on the UK Sport board that there may be an opportunity here to do things better.

'We will collate all the information from the governing bodies - those that are funded and those that are not funded - as well as the athletes and the general public and make recommendations on that basis.'

Carr said it was also possible that the decision would be not to change the current approach and instead recommend that team sports such as basketball should only receive funding from bodies such as Sport England, which targets the grassroots and participation, and should not be funded at elite level unless it can prove it can challenge for medals.
