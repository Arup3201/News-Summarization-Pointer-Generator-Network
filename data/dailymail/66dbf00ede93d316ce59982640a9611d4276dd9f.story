Two more British soldiers were killed yesterday by a rogue Afghan policeman.

Their deaths prompted a former government minister to call for British troops to leave Afghanistan by Christmas.

The shooting of the troops - from the 1st Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles - by an Afghan they believed to be on their side takes the number of British servicemen and women killed in so-called 'green on blue' insider attacks to 11.

The figure represents a quarter of all UK forces to die in the conflict this year.

Labour’s former Europe minister Denis McShane urged the Prime Minister to bring the entire 9,500-strong UK force home by Christmas, rather than wait until the end of 2014 for the scheduled final withdrawal.

Conservative MP Bob Stewart, who commanded UN troops in Bosnia, said ‘green on blue’ incidents had reached ‘enormous proportions’ and the Afghan authorities’ efforts to vet recruits to root out insurgents was ‘clearly not working’.

He told the BBC: ‘Enough is enough. This has gone on too long. We should get our troops out as fast as possible.

‘It’s not as easy to pull stumps as some people suggest, but we should get them out as fast as possible.’

However, defence chiefs have insisted the drawdown process should not be derailed by ‘insider attacks’.

Yesterday’s deaths at a checkpoint in the Nahr-e-Saraj area of Helmand took the number of NATO’s International Security Assistance Force to die this year alone in attacks by Afghans wearing police or army uniforms to 56.

Both soldiers were from 1st Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles and were killed in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand 
Province.

A spokesman for Task Force Helmand, Major Laurence Roche, said: 'I am saddened to report the deaths of two soldiers from 1st Battalion 
The Royal Gurkha Rifles who were shot and killed by a man wearing an 
Afghan police uniform at a checkpoint in the Nahr-e Saraj district of 
Helmand Province.

'The loss of these soldiers is a huge blow to The Royal Gurkha Rifles 
and everyone serving in Task Force Helmand.  Our thoughts are with their
families, friends and fellow Gurkhas at this time.'

The soldiers next of kin have been informed.

An Afghan police official in the southern province of Helmand said efforts were underway to apprehend the policeman involved.

So-called insider attacks on Western forces have undermined trust between coalition and Afghan forces as NATO prepares to withdraw most combat troops by the end of 2014.

Just last week two U.S. and one Australian soldier were shot and killed by a man in an Afghan police uniform.

The attacks come despite the Afghan government launching a large-scale push to re-screen thousands of security forces, trying to identify infiltrators or those who might not be considered secure.

The Taliban have said they are using the attacks as a specific strategy to drive a wedge between the international coalition and the Afghans. 

Last Wednesday, the leader of the Afghan Taliban, Mullah Mohammad Omar, released a statement saying insurgents would increase the number of insider attacks against coalition and Afghan forces.

In an emailed statement congratulating Muslims as they prepare to celebrate the Eid al-Adha holiday, Mullah Mohammad Omar urged 'every brave Afghan in the ranks of the foreign forces and their Afghan hirelings ... to strike them.'

'Jihadist activities inside the 
circle of the state militias are the most effective stratagem. Its 
dimension will see further expansion, organization and efficiency,' he 
said.

'Increase your efforts to expand the area of infiltration in the ranks of the enemy.

The
killings have stretched to the breaking point a partnership that U.S. 
and NATO officials consider a key part their exit plan - preparing the 
Afghans to take over responsibility for their country’s security in just
over two years’ time.

The program, where Afghans and international troops are supposed to work 'shoulder to shoulder,' is now being re-evaluated.

Last week it was revealed two British 
soldiers shot dead in Afghanistan may have been the victims of a revenge
attack by local police.

The growing trend of so-called 'green-on-blue' attacks in Afghanistan is becoming of increasing concern after a surge in numbers this year.

Officially, nine British troops have died at the hands of Afghan colleagues so far this year.

That figure does not include today's deaths, also believed to be 'insider attacks', as well as the deaths of Army medic Corporal Channing Day and Royal Marine Corporal David O'Connor last week, which are still being investigated.

The growing number of British troops killed by Afghan colleagues this year compares to just one such death in 2011, prompting calls for a faster withdrawal of Britain's armed forces in Afghanistan.

The planned draw-down will see the withdrawal of combat troops in the country by the end of 2014.

Conservative MP Bob Stewart, who commanded UN troops in Bosnia as an army colonel, said last month that green-on-blue incidents had reached 'enormous proportions' and the Afghan authorities' efforts to vet recruits to root out insurgents was 'clearly not working'.

He told the BBC: 'Enough is enough. This has gone on too long. We should get our troops out as fast as possible. It's not as easy to pull stumps as some people suggest, but we should get them out as fast as possible.'

Labour's former Europe minister Denis McShane also urged the Prime Minister to bring the entire 9,500-strong force home by Christmas, rather than waiting until the end of 2014 for final withdrawal.And earlier this month, relatives marking the 11th anniversary of the start of the war echoed that demand.

But defence chiefs have insisted the draw-down process should not be derailed by 'insider attacks'.

Speaking last week, Mr Hammond said: 'We are pulling out of Afghanistan. We have a plan to end our combat role by the end of 2014, to draw down significantly during the course of next year but on the way to continue our task of training, mentoring the Afghans so that they can take over the security role.

'Overall the security picture across Afghanistan is steadily improving, I am confident about that, but this is not suburban England and it never will be.'

And Brigadier Doug Chalmers, the outgoing commander of Task Force Helmand, said although the number of green-on-blue attacks rose during his six-month tour, it did not dent soldiers' resolve.

'We suffered three incidents on our tour which left seven of our soldiers killed,' he said.

'Numerically, the insider threat did go up on our tour. We knew that within the brigade. Of all the casualties we have suffered these are without a shadow of a doubt the hardest to bear.'

But he said the issue was with 'individuals not institutions', adding: 'The green-on-blue element of the insider threat is a risk and it does add to the pressure but it is just one of many risks that our soldiers face every day.

'I visited all of our teams throughout the tour and their sense of commitment and belief in what they were doing was simply very, very strong.

'I visited the teams after they had lost soldiers due to insider attacks, all of them still had absolutely firm belief in the task they were doing and were back on the job within 48 hours.'

Corporal Channing Day, 25, of 3 Medical Regiment and Corporal David O’Connor, 27, of 40 Commando, Royal Marines, were previously thought to have been caught up in a so-called ‘friendly fire’ incident.

But after interviewing witnesses and recovering fragments of ammunition, Royal Military Police investigators have ruled out the theory that the pair were shot by British Forces.

A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman confirmed that the deaths were caused by ‘a third party... not UK personnel’.

And Defence Secretary Philip Hammond – asked whether the British personnel had been killed in a ‘green on blue’ attack, when Afghan personnel turn on their British partners – said: ‘There is a possibility that that is what has happened but it is not clear at this stage.’
