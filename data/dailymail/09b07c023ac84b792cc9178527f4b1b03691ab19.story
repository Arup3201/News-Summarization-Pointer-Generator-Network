The charges against Michael Le Vell were brought after a conflict of opinion between two leading lawyers in the Crown Prosecution, it has emerged.

After his initial arrest in September 2011, the actor was the subject of an intense police investigation.

The alleged victim was interviewed on video by specialist officers trained to deal with such cases and she told them about the abuse and rape in detail.

The DPP’s Principal Legal Advisor, Alison Levitt QC (left) overruled Chief Crown Prosecutor, Nazir Afzal, (right) who had decided there was insufficient evidence to charge le Vell with any of the abuse or rape allegations

After the police investigation had been concluded a file of evidence was passed on to the Crown Prosecution Service North West.

The Chief Crown Prosecutor, Nazir Afzal, examined the file in detail looking at all the allegations and evidence.

But after weighing it up he decided there was insufficient evidence to charge le Vell with any of the abuse or rape allegations.

Ordeal: Le Vell was charged with 19 child sex offences including rape - later reduced to 12 specimen charges - in February 2012

Both
parties were both told of this decision in late December 2011 and Le 
Vell was said to be ‘relieved and delighted’ at the decision.

However
the victim’s mother was said to be furious and after speaking with 
police officers she made a formal complaint against the CPS in February 
2012.

The girl also 
returned to the police in March 2012 told them she had forgotten to 
mention other rapes she had suffered at the hands of the actor.

Catalyst? The Jimmy Savile sex scandal erupted in October 2012 causing a wholesale re-evaluation of sex cases, particularly those offences against children

The
Jimmy Savile sex scandal erupted in October 2012 causing a wholesale 
re-evaluation of sex cases, particularly those offences against 
children.

The CPS say that in the light of the formal complaint they decided to review the case and Alison Levitt QC, the DPP’s Principal Legal Advisor, overruled Mr Afzal’s decision.

In fact she concluded there was sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and that the earlier decision not to prosecute should be overturned.

Le Vell was subsequently charged with 19 child sex offences including rape - later reduced to 12 specimen charges - in February 2012.

Last night a spokesman for the CPS said: ‘The victim’s mother made a formal complaint in February 2012 and asked for the decision to be reviewed, which led to a further detailed review of the evidence by Alison Levitt QC, the DPP’s Principal legal Advisor.

‘She concluded that there was sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and that the earlier decision not to prosecute should be overturned.

‘In addition the victim made further allegations to the police in March 2012 which were investigated by the police.

'The Principal Legal Advisor also reviewed this additional evidence and in February 2013 authorised that the defendant be charged with 19 offences in total.

‘All victims now have the right, if they are concerned about a decision not to charge, to ask for the case to be looked at again.

'This process enabled the CPS to re-review this case, to consider the evidence afresh including some further allegations by the victim, and to bring charges.’
