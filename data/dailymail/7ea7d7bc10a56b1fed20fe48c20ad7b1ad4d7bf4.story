Relatives of an Ohio couple who died at a nursing home 11 hours apart on the same day say their love story's ending reflects their devotion over 65 years of marriage.

The Dayton Daily News reports that Harold J 'Doc' Knapke, 91, and Ruth L Knapke, 89, died in their shared room at Versailles Health Care Center on August 11, days before their 66th anniversary.

Their daughters say they believe their father willed himself to stay with his wife despite failing health until they could take the next step in their journey together. He went first; she followed.

Wedded bliss: The Knapkes married in 1947, but Ruth Knapke had loved 'Doc' since they were children

'It is really just a love story,' their daughter Carol Romie told the Dayton Daily News.

Great love: The Knapkes were married for 65 years before they both died peacefully within hours of each other

'They were so committed and loyal and dedicated, they weren't going to go anywhere without the other one.'

Ruth 'Ruthie' Schmitz was born in St. Henry, Ohio, and her husband, 'Doc' Knapke was born in Coldwater.

According to the Dayton Daily News, Ruthie Schmitz had had a crush on Doc Knapke since the third grade.

Knapke was an Army lieutenant in service in Germany during World War II when he and Schmitz began writing to each other. 

'I let him chase me until I caught him!' was how Ruth Knapke described the couple's courtship.

The Knapkes were married August 20, 1947, in St. Henry, Ohio.

They
went on to have seven children, tragically losing their son Jeffrey in 
infancy, 14 grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.

Doc
Knapke was a beloved teacher, principal, coach and athletic director at
Fort Recovery Schools and a former co-owner of Miracle Lanes Bowling 
Alley, Fort Recovery.

He was eventually inducted into the Fort Recovery Athletic Hall of Fame and the Fort Recovery Alumni Hall of Fame.

Sportsman: Harold Knapke was a sophomore when he was on the basketball team at Dayton University Ohio in 1942

Tribute: The couple left behind a loving family of eight children and 14 grandchildren

Eternal rest: The Knapkes were active at their local church and asked that in lieu of gifts at their funeral, attendees donate to the Harold and Ruth Knapke Scholarship fund

Daughter Margaret Knapke says she believes her father, whose health wasn't good over the last few years of his life, was staying alive for her mother.

'In recent years, we often speculated that Dad was still here, in this life, because of Mom. It seemed that, even though his health and strength were so very diminished, he couldn't stop being her protector; it seemed he didn't want to leave her behind,' she told the Dayton Daily News.

A photograph of the couple taken in June shows the couple's tenderness toward each other. Doc is napping in his bed at the hospital, but still holding hands with Ruthie through the the guard rail. 

During the last week of her life, Ruth Knapke developed a severe infection and her children knew the prognosis wasn't good.

In heaven: The couple would have celebrated their 66th wedding anniversary on 20 August, nine days after they died

The Knapke children told their father that his wife wasn't going to make it and say he spent a sleepless night worrying.

'The next day, Friday, there was a certain calm about him, and he began to fail rapidly. As you might know, Dad died 11 hours before Mom did - both of them on Sunday - and we believe he did that as a final act of love for her. We believe he wanted to accompany her out of this life and into the next one, and he did,' Margaret told the Dayton Daily News.

They had a joint funeral Mass, with granddaughters carrying Ruth's casket and grandsons carrying Harold's casket. The cemetery procession stopped outside the farm house where the couple had raised their six children and enjoyed so many years of marriage.

The current owners, in respect to the Knapkes, flew  a flag at half-mast.
