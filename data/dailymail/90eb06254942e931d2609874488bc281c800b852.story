Severe weather swept across Sydney on Tuesday, showering some southern suburbs in rain and hail, but it also brought some strange and surreal sky sensations with it.

The beaches, city, and outer areas of Sydney were covered with bizarre bubbly looking clouds for much of the day that appeared more threatening than they actually were as the system soon moved out to sea.

Called mammatus clouds - derived from the word mammary because of their round shape - these formations are most often associated with severe thunderstorms.

Sydney's Bondi Beach got a makeover on Tuesday as a serious thunderstorm swept over the region 

The storm brought with it strange bubbly clouds which spread across the greater Sydney area, seen here over St Mary's Cathedral in the CBD

Blue skies battled with the darkness for airspace in the inner-city suburbs 

Bondi Beach got a particularly spectacular facelift as the collection of cloud pockets cast a huge shadow over the iconic stretch of sand.

Just a hint of blue sky was visible at the horizon and many brave swimmers and surfers still took the plunge and went for a dip in the stormy water.

In the city St Mary's Cathedral looked almost gothic against the strange sky setting as its turrets stood out against the startling scene above it.

Skyscrapers in the CBD stuck out against the dark stormy sky, and earlier in the day the Bureau of Meteorology issued a storm warning for hail and damaging winds in the greater Sydney region, the Illawarra and parts of the Hunter. 

In other parts of Sydney strips of blue sky and sunshine were pushing through the dark blanket enveloping the city, and some even managed to catch the hint of a rainbow later in the day.

The surreal clouds were captured over many part of the region, however other areas weren't so lucky and enjoyed a hail storm instead of a show.

Picton, south west of Sydney, and Camden - in the region's west - were both hit with serious sized hailstorms but luckily the storm passed almost as quickly as it appeared.

Earlier on Tuesday a number of students at a Catholic school in West Hoxton in Sydney's west were treated after it was suspected the oval they were sitting on may have been struck by lightning.

The immediate threat has now passed according to the Bureau, however they are continuing to monitor the situation and have urged people to be aware of floodwater.
