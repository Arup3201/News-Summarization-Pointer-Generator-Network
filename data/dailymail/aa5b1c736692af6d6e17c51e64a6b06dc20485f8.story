Looking to escape the hustle and bustle of city life? Then this job may be for you - but only if you can put up with the company of 2,000 ‘smelly’ penguins.

Applications opened yesterday to run the world’s most remote post office - on Goudier Island in the Antarctic, where average temperatures are in the region of -10C.

Candidates are required to be able to ‘carry a big heavy box over slippery rocks and slushy snow whilst dodging penguins’, go a month without a shower and survive with no heating or running water.

Chilly: Applications opened yesterday to run the world’s most remote post office - on Goudier Island in the Antarctic, where average temperatures are in the region of -10C

The location is so remote that even helicopters are unable to get there, which means the nearest doctor is three days away on a ship.

There is also no internet or Wi-Fi connection, no central heating, no phone signal, and no means of communication with the world other than by VHF radio.

The successful applicant will run the shop, post office, museum, and maintenance operation at Port Lockroy, on the tiny Goudier Island off the Antarctic Peninsula during its summer months of November and March.

The advert by the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust (UKAHT), says it is looking for people with ‘adaptability to different situations’.

Port Lockroy is visited between by approximately 18,000 ship-borne visitors amounting to two ship visits per day. The base is also home to the only gift shop in the continent

It adds: ‘Are you happy not to shower for up to a month, live in close proximity to three people and 2,000 smelly penguins for five months?’

‘Can you enthuse to visitors when it is -5C and blowing a blizzard as well as cook supper cheerfully after a long cold day and very little sleep?

‘Living conditions are comfortable though basic with no mains power, heat or water, and limited communications.

‘Happy to be confined to a small island with no prospect of climbing the surrounding peaks.’

Being the southernmost tip of the globe, there is no darkness, with daylight 24 hours a day.

Applications close on February 27 and the salary is £1,100 per calendar month. Expenses and subsistence are covered by the UKAHT.

Applicants must also have good physical and medical fitness and good DIY skills are a plus.

Temperatures on the tiny island, which is the size of a primary school playing field, range from -5C to 15C.

Amy Kincaid, 23, a geography graduate from Oban in Argyll, Scotland, has already travelled 11,000 miles to help run the most southerly post office in the world.
