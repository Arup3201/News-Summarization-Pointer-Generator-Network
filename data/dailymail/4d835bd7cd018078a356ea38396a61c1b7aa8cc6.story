A self-proclaimed Nazi who is trying to gain custody of his children having named his son after Adolf Hitler was a wife-beating tyrant who was obsessed with the devil, his wife has claimed.

Cathy Bowlby, who was married to white supremacist Heath Campbell for three years, revealed he tried to name their first-born Lucifer.

But she 'talked him out of it' by suggesting that their son take their father's name instead.

Wife-beater: Heath Campbell, 40, appeared at a New Jersey court last week  to try to reclaim custody of his children, wearing full Nazi 
regalia and accompanied by fellow Nazi Bethanie White

Full regalia: Heath Campbell, appeared at a New Jersey court on Monday, in a Nazi outfit to convince a judge that he was a good father and should have custody of his children

Campbell appeared at court on Monday 
dressed in full Nazi uniform as he tried to convince a judge that he was
a good father - despite having named one of his children Adolf.

But Bowlby told the New York Daily News: 'He claimed that his mother was raped and he was the evil seed planted inside her.

'He believed he was the devil reborn 
to take over the world. He'd say, "I believe in the devil. I worship the
devil. I am the devil."'

Last week, Heath Campbell, who had four children, asked the judge to be allowed to see his 18-month-old son Hons.

Campbell,
from New Jersey, has given three of his children Nazi-inspired names 
but claims he is fit to be a father and has never abused them.

Bowlby said one of his favorite activities was taking her on car rides to a local cemetery.

'To show me where he was going to bury me when he killed me,' she said.

She also claimed he terrorised their 
son, Heath. Once, furious that his two-year-old had knocked into the 
curtains, Campbell picked up a running vacuum cleaner and held it inches
from Heath’s face, she said.

'He was absolutely terrified,' Bowlby
told the New York Daily News. 'For years after, he would scream and cry
when he saw a vacuum cleaner.'

Before appearing in court, Campbell, who had a swastika tattoo clearly showing on his neck, told NBC10: 'I'm going to tell the judge, I love my children. I wanna be a father, let me be it.

'Let me prove to the world that I am a good father.'

Pleas: White supremacist Campbell, his swastika tattoo on show,said that he wanted to show the world he could be a good father

Controversial: Campbell, who has his own neo-Nazi organization, walks into court with a supporter wearing knee-high boots and a swastika arm band

He
said that he had never abused his children and had only named them. He 
has not seen his children in two years and the eldest three have been 
adopted.

The 
40-year-old white appeared at a hearing in Hunterdon County Family Court
in Flemington, New Jersey. His regalia included knee-high black boots 
and swastika patches.

He told the TV station that whether wearing his Nazi uniform might sway the judge's decision, depended on the judge.

Bethanie White, a member of his organization 'Hitler's Order', was with Campbell at court - also covered in swastikas.

Decisions: The Campbells, pictured leaving court in 2009, said they chose the names as they were unique

Adolf Hitler Campbell, six, and his younger sisters Joycelynn Aryan Nation, five, and Honszlynn Hinler, four, were taken into custody in January 2009.

State
officials also took another son, Hons Campbell, from his parents Heath 
and Deborah Campbell just hours after he was born in November 2011.

A court denied the Campbells' appeal to have their children returned last year.

The Nazi-inspired names came to light
after a store refused to decorate a birthday cake reading 'Happy 
birthday Adolf Hitler' in December 2008.

In 2010, a
New Jersey appeals court ruled there was sufficient evidence of abuse 
or neglect due to prior domestic violence to seize the children.

Authorities insisted putting the children into care had nothing to do with their names.

Court records from previous hearings show that the oldest child, Adolf, frequently threatened to kill people.

The
mother reportedly had also once given a note to her neighbour saying she
was terrified of her husband, who had threatened to kill her.

The Campbells have previously defended the names, saying they chose them simply because they liked them and they were unique.

Campbell said he named his son after the Nazi leader as 'no one else in the world would have that name'.

Campbell has since separated from his wife and she has given up rights to her children.

A follow-up hearing has been scheduled for later this month.
