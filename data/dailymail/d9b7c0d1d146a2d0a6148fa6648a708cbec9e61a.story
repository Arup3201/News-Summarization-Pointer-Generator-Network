England’s players have been losing up to two kilogrammes in weight in each training session during their World Cup preparations.

Roy Hodgson has been keen to get his squad accustomed to the smouldering heat and humidity of Manaus, in the Amazon rainforest, where England start their campaign against Italy on Saturday week.

First he took them to Portugal, where they trained in thermal layers and hats and gloves and then back to St George’s Park where players were sent into the special heat chambers, where the temperature can be carefully controlled as they work on exercise machines.

'We’ve been
 really busy as well,' said goalkeeper Ben Foster. 'At St George’s Park 
last week we were doing double sessions. We trained in the morning, had 
lunch and then everybody would literally have to go and have a bit of a 
sleep.

'It’s
 been kind of like pre-season and then at night we were doing bike 
sessions and heat chambers, where basically, you’re in a sauna on a 
bike. We’ve been doing half-hour sessions in there and it’s brutal, 
really hard work. No one’s grumbled or moaned about it, just got on with
 it.

'When
 we were in Portugal we wore under-armour, t-shirts, zip-up tops with 
wet top over that. So it’s a lot of layers. When it was 22 degrees, the 
lads were losing two kilos in sweat in every training session.

'It’s
 what goes with it. It’s trying to replicate the heat and humidity out 
here. So we’d be weighed before and after training, so you’d know how 
much fluid you’ve got to replace.'

Hodgson
 has a large sports science team at his disposal to help get the 
necessary salts, minerals and electrolytes back into the players’ bodies
 after they have sweated so heavily in the tropical climates.

The running boys: England goalkeepers Ben Foster, Fraser Forster and Joe Hart warm up in Miami

As
 they trained in Miami’s Sun Life Stadium ahead of Wednesday's friendly 
against Ecuador, the backroom team pulled out large drinks tubs, 
carefully labelled with the players’ names because they all have 
individually tailored recovery drinks.

Some
 players will sweat more than others and in different ways, losing 
different minerals, and this has been carefully monitored by a series of
 tests taken since the squad first assembled two weeks ago.

The
 pitch-side temperature in Miami yesterday was 27 degrees at 10.15am and
 there were four enormous propeller fans by the side of the pitch to 
help players cool down as they took drinks breaks between exercises.

The
 game against Ecuador will kick-off at 3pm local time, so it is expected
 to be warmer, but still not as warm and humid as it is likely to be 
against Italy in Manaus. FIFA will allow water-breaks during the World 
Cup game if both teams agree, which England and Italy have.
