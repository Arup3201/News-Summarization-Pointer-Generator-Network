More bad news for the Secret Service today as a government investigation has found more conduct they deem 'problematic.'

Operation Moonlight, which happened three years ago, had agents removed from their posts in Washington D.C. and heading almost an hour outside the city to settle a dispute between an agency employee and her neighbor.

On at least two of these occasions, President Obama was in residence.

A government investigation uncovered an operation that had Secret Service agents tasked with guarding the White House travelling an hour outside the city to help a coworker with a dispute with a neighbor, something agency deputy director A.T. Smith (above) was aware of

No one's watching: Two of the times that agents from the Prowler unit were away, President Obama (above) was in residence

The agents sent out were part of the Prowler unit, tasked with responding to suspicious people and situations in and around the White House and national capital area.

The report by the Homeland Security Department's inspector general calls the conduct 'problematic,' and says that the employee's friendship with high-level Secret Service officials creates the appearance it was motivated by personal relations 'rather than furthering official government functions.' 

A Secret Service employee who worked as the assistant to then-director, Mark Sullivan, was involved in a dispute with her neighbor, who was harassing her and assaulted her father. This 'resulted in the loss of several of her father's teeth,' the report says.

Local police arrested the neighbor, and the employee, identified as Lisa Chopey, sought out a protective order. But it didn't stop there.

She told investigators that Keith Prewitt, then the deputy director of the Secret Service, was a family friend. And when he heard her story, Prewitt told A.T. Smith, then the assistant director for investigations, that the Secret Service should do something to help her out.

Smith directed one of his managers to have agents drive out to Chopey's home in La Plata, Maryland, to check on her. 

The report says that Sullivan, the agency director who's since retired, was made aware of that decision.

This is all happening just a few weeks after Julia Pierson stepped down as head of the agency over numerous lapses in security

Utah's Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who is leading investigations of the Secret Service as chairman of an oversight subcommittee, said that Smith should be fired

Prowler teams are not part of the presidential protective division, and agency personnel interviewed for the report insisted that their protective function was not compromised. 

The mission was over before long - five days of visits are documented, with the longest lasting eight hours.

But the report notes that during those times, 'the Prowler team would have been unable to respond to exigencies at the White House.'

Several of the people named in the report, including Chopey, have retired or moved on from the Secret Service, but Smith is now the agency deputy director. 

Utah's Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who is leading investigations of the Secret Service as chairman of an oversight subcommittee, said that Smith should be fired and called the agency's actions 'inexcusable.'

This all comes just weeks after Julia Pierson resigned as Director of the United States Secret Service following numerous security lapses involving the agency.
