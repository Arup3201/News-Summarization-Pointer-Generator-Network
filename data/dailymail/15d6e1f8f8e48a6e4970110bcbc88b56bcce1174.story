Jetstar has apologised after a crew member advised Splendour in the Grass festival goers to dump their drugs before the plane landed in Sydney.

People who attended the music festival near Byron Bay were on a flight out of the Gold Coast on Sunday night when the crew member issued a public announcement.

The flight attendant said sniffer dogs and quarantine officers were waiting at the domestic terminal and advised them to flush 'anything you shouldn't have' down the toilet.

The announcement reportedly sparked a rush to the bathrooms.

Jetstar confirmed an employee made their own quarantine announcement about sniffer dogs waiting at Sydney Airport late Sunday night

Jetstar says the staff member will be reprimanded.

The airline says the staffer was complying with a requirement that airlines make quarantine announcements, but the crew member's words were 'poorly chosen and plainly at odds with the professional standards we'd expect from our team'.

But some took a more positive view.

'Thank you for caring for your Splendour passengers,' one person posted on Jetstar Australia's Facebook page. 'Very thoughtful and kind thing to do.

'Hope the staff member will be promoted.'

There are reports a number of passengers dashed for the plane's toilets and were seen queuing as they clenched things in their hands.

But the crew member's announcement left some passengers angered and questioning the reasoning behind warning people who may have been breaking the law and otherwise could have been caught.

The airline confirmed the employee made his own improvised quarantine announcement rather than the using prerecorded one used by Jetstar.

A spokesman said the airline is required to play the prerecorded announcement to passengers on all interstate and territory boarders and that its procedures allow cabin crew to deliver the quarantine message through public announcement as was done on this occasion.

'The crew member's words were poorly chosen and are plainly at odds with the professional standards we'd expect from our team. We're addressing the matter with the cabin crew member involved.'
