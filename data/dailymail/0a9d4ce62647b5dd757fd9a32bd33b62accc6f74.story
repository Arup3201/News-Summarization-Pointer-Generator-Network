Keli Lane previously appealed her conviction for the murder of her daughter Tegan at the Supreme Court of NSW in 2010

Baby killer Keli Lane's last hope of overturning her murder conviction has been lost, after the High Court rejected her bid to appeal.

Lane was found guilty in 2010 of murdering her newborn daughter Tegan Lee Lane within hours of leaving Auburn Hospital in September 1996 with the baby, whose remains have never been found.

After leaving the hospital the 39-year-old water polo player then went to her parents' home, before attending a wedding that afternoon.

In 2011 she was jailed for a maximum term of 18 years.

She is currently incarcerated in Australia's toughest women's jail, Silverwater Women's Correctional Centre in western Sydney.

Currently, Lane would not be eligible for parole until she has served thirteen years and six months, on May 12, 2023.

Her appeal to the High Court was her final avenue to have her murder conviction overturned, following a rejected bid by the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal last December, which reportedly had her distraught and hyperventilating in her Silverwater jail cell.

But on Friday, Australia's highest court rejected her application for special leave to appeal.

Keli Lane was almost one of Australia's golden girls – a private schoolgirl and talented sportswoman with hopes of representing her country at the 2000 Sydney Olympics.

But it all came crashing down due to a secret she kept for 14 years – the baby girl who vanished within days of her giving birth – and today convicted child murderer Keli Lane lost her last desperate bid to win freedom from jail.

Lane (pictured left in 2006 attending court and right in 1996 at a friend's 21st) gave birth in secret to Tegan Lee Lane in 1996. Two days later she attended a friend's wedding without the baby, who was not seen again 

Tall, blonde Keli Lane was a familiar and admired figure in the Sydney surfside suburb of Manly before her stunning and tragic fall from grace.

She is the daughter of a well-known surfer, rugby player and retired NSW police inspector, Robert Lane.

An elite water polo player at national and international level, Lane was a member of the silver-medal winning Australian Junior Women's team at the 1995 World Championships in Quebec, and it was her ambition to represent Australia in water polo at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.

It was perhaps this that led to her disposing of her baby - Lane became pregnant, but could not afford to care for child while pursuing her sporting ambitions.

On 12 September 1996, Lane, aged 21, gave birth in secret to Tegan Lee Lane at Auburn Hospital in western Sydney.

Two days after giving birth to the child, Lane and her boyfriend attended a friend's wedding and there was no sign of the baby, nor were people aware of her pregnancy - including her boyfriend.

It was as if the child had never existed.

Lane had a troubled history with pregnancies, which she had either terminated or given away the child soon after birth.

She finally had a fourth child, who now visits Lane in prison.

Lane's downfall came when a Department of Community Services officer became suspicious about the existence of a missing child and an investigation was made into the birth of Tegan.

Lane first told police that Tegan was living with a family in Perth.

She said the father was a man called Andrew Morris, which she later changed to Andrew Norris, and that she had handed him the child in the Auburn Hospital car park.

After a controversial - and traumatic four-month trial - Lane was convicted in December 2010 of lying under oath and of murdering her baby Tegan.
