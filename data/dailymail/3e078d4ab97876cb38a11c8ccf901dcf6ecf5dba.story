Two kayakers off the Argentinian coast were in for the experience of a lifetime when a pod of whales swam directly towards them and lifted one of the kayaks out of the water. 

A GoPro captured the amazing experience as the pair looked on in awe while the curious marine mammals approached them in waters off Puerto Madryn, in Argentina's south.

The footage shows the kayakers first approaching and then stopping to look at the pod in the distance, but unperturbed, the whales swim in the direction of the pair.

A GoPro captured the incredible moments a pod of whales swam directly towards two kayakers off the Argentinian coast

At first the kayakers paddle in the direction of the pod, but after stopping, the curious mammals make their way towards them

The kayakers can be heard gasping in shock as the inquisitive mammals appear to head in their direction 

Within touching distance, one of the mammals appears to turn so it can pass directly under one of the kayacks, with its back breaching through the water.

Gasps can be heard as the whale manages to slightly lift one of the kayacks out of the water by balancing it on its back for a few seconds.

The GoPro is then put underwater to capture the gigantic mammal as it starts to move away and as the pod swim away from the kayakers, excited laughs can be heard while the brief interaction comes to an end.

A nearly two-minute video was uploaded to YouTube on Sunday and has had more than 94,000 hits as of Wednesday morning.
