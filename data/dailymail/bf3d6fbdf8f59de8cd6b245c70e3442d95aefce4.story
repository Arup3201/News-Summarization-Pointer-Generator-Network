From the risque to the downright dark, there's only one way to get better advertising than forking out for ad space during the Super Bowl - having your ad banned from playing during the Super Bowl.

As advertisers and Super Bowl fans know, the biggest spectacle at the game doesn't happen on-field - it happens during the commercial break.

Advertisers pull out all the stops to create buzz about their brands during the biggest television event of the year.

Figured it out: Scarlett Johnnsen actually says during her banned SodaStream commercial, 'How can I get this to go viral?'

Banned Bud: This banned ad for Bud Light features officer workers getting naked for free beer

Bro love: This commercial featuring two friends kissing, for ManCrunch, a gay hook-up site, did not make the cut

In the effort to be the topic of 
conversation around the water cooler on Monday, though, some go a little
 too far and are deemed inappropriate to air by the network or the NFL.

This
 is sometimes even more beneficial to the company than going to air 
would have been, creating a clamor the see the ad that's too rude for 
TV.

This year, Israeli 
company SodaStream's ad featuring Scarlett Johannsen was rejected 
because it calls out SodaStream’s direct competitors by name. At the end
 of the 33-second spot, Johansson says: 'Sorry, Coke and Pepsi.'

Fox
 requested that SodaStream omit the last line, presumably because Pepsi 
is a sponsor of the Super Bowl’s halftime show. SodaStream complied and 
the edited ad will air on Sunday night.

The uncensored version has been viewed YouTube more than eight million times in five days.

The
 NFL's decision to ban rifle maker Daniel Defense from airing a 
commercial during Superbowl XLVIII has led to protests from America's 
gun lobby.

Unsatisfied: The network did not air this Snickers ad featuring two men inadvertently kissing

Controversial: This ad for a company called 'Jesus hates Obama' had its ad banned after Fox said it was 'not acceptable to run'

In the clip, a former marine speaks about protecting his family in their quaint, suburban home.

He pulls into the driveway and then stops on the front walk, briefly scanning the neighborhood for snipers and suicide bombers.

'No one has the right to tell me how to defend them,' he says of his wife and baby.

The company's logo then flashes on the screen - a silhouette of 'the most effective tool for the job', an AR15 assault rifle.

The
 ad was banned last month for flouting the NFL's gun rule which state: 
'Firearms, ammunition or other weapons are prohibited; however, stores 
that sell firearms and ammunitions (e.g., outdoor stores and camping 
stores) will be permitted, provided they sell other products and the ads
 do not mention firearms, ammunition or other weapons.'

Following
 the NFL's ruling, Daniel Defense offered to replace the company's logo 
with an American flag and/or the words 'Shall not be infringed'.

The company was willing to replace the
 gun with an American flag or the words 'Shall Not Be Infringed'. But 
the NFL wouldn't budge.

In 
an interview on Fox and Friends, Daniel Defense CEO Marty Daniel said: 
'We actually went to the rule box and pulled out their set of rules and 
got a big no.'

Petitions in 
support of the ad have followed - such as one titled 'Allow Daniel 
Defense to show their SuperBowl commercial supporting Freedom!' - along 
with cries of support on the company's Facebook page.

Banned: The Daniel Defense advert shows a family safe and well in their suburban home

All American: The man in the advert is a former Marine returning from duty

Speaking about his wife and child, the Marine then says: 'No one has the right to tell me how to defend them'

A silhouette of 'the most effective tool for the job' then flashes on screen - an assault rifle from Daniel Defense

The Superbowl will be played in New Jersey between the Denver Broncos, whose quarterback Peyton Manning is pictured here (left), and the Seattle Seahawks

Last year's Superbowl, broadcast by NBC from Indianapolis, saw record prices for advertising spots.

The Associated Press put the price at $3.5 million to $4 million for
 30 seconds. Less than 20 years ago, a half-minute of Super Bowl ad time
 cost less than $1 million.

That money now buys the largest TV 
audience in the U.S. Two years ago, a record of more than 111 million 
Americans watched the Green Bay Packers beat Pittsburgh Steelers, and 
many paid close attention to the dozens of commercials aired during game
 breaks.

Stephen Master, head of sports for Nielsen, which tracks viewership, said: 'There's nothing to compare it to. Maybe the Oscars or some of the music (awards) shows, but not really.'

One
 poster, Shawn Butt, said: 'Alcohol and automobiles are both responsible
 for more deaths than firearms. But the NFL doesn't seem to have a 
problem with either of those.'

A
 YouTube video in response to the ban complaining that the NFL has 
become 'politicized' now boasts more than two million views - far more 
than the original commercial.

The gambit has worked for Bud Light, too. The company's Super Bowl submissions seem to have been rejected regularly.

2006's
 Bud Light 'Bottle Opener' commercial during which a man's rear end is 
used as a bottle opener after he jumps over the bar to try and steal Bud
 Light and hides when the bar tender returns.

Another
 in 2010 called Clothing Drive has office workers - mostly men, in an 
unusual reversal for Super Bowl commercials - strip naked for a clothing
 drive in which one free Bud Light is offered per piece of clothing.

Sex
 sells, but can it sell vegetables? Vegies are generally offensive to 
young children, but when near-naked models rub them all over their 
bodies they become slightly less family-friendly, as in Veggie Love, 
PETA's call for people to go vegetarian in 2009.

The
 corporation responded to the ad’s rejection in a post on its website. 
'Thinking network execs could really benefit from a broccoli booty 
call,' it reads. 'Watch the video to see what the controversy is all 
about.'

Caught: Farting is apparently also an unacceptable feature in Super Bowl ads as this ad for Smart Beep was banned by the network

Stuck: This KGB ad, called 'In the Hole' features the wives of two men who both got their heads stuck up their own behinds following a conversation about climate change - and was banned

Go Daddy is a repeat offender, with its 2005 offering, 
featuring a young woman, bra-less, in a skimpy singlet jumping around in
 front of a panel for a 'broadcast hearing.'

Snickers offended the gay community with their 
commercial, which features two mechanics devouring one Snickers bar, 
Lady and the Tramp style, resulting in an inadvertant kiss. They then 
rip out handfuls of chest hair to reassert their manliness.

Another commercial featuring man-on-man love from Man Crunch was banned by CBS in 2010 for being 'not within the network's broadcast standards for Super Bowl Sunday.'

Smart Beep's ad Blind Date features a woman passing gas in a car that she believes is empty before her date gets in - but discovers there's a couple in the back.

Super Bowl XLVIII will pit the Denver Broncos against the Seattle Seahawks on February 2 at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.
