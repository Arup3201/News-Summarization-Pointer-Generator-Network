A 13-year-old California boy stopped a kidnapper in his tracks as he tried to take off with his four-year-old sister, deputies said Saturday.

ABC reports Earl Williams, 61, walked past the fence of a Lancaster home and into the yard where the little girl was.

He asked her what her name was, picked her up and tried to walk away, before her older brother grabbed Williams by the arm and yelled for someone to call police.

Kidnapping: A 13-year-old California boy stopped a kidnapper who had walked past the fence of his Lancaster home and tried to take off with his 4-year-old sister

'He was definitely quick on his feet. He's very responsible for his family and obviously his 4-year-old sister. So at this point, he is our hero for today,' said Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy Mighuel Ruiz.

Neighbors found Lancaster deputies patrolling nearby and led them to Williams.

He was charged with kidnapping and is being held on $100,000 bail.

'It's a kidnapping charge,' said Sgt Eric Metten. 'Not attempted - because he actually picked her up and walked away with her.'

A neighbor saw Williams walking through the neighborhood talking to himself before trying to kidnap the girl.

'He was just calling me, "Hey, come here. Come here," said Jasmine Watts. 'I don't know this guy, never seen him before.'

'He was already talking to himself when me and my son came outside,' Watts added. 'So I'm just like, "Okay, this is really weird."'

The girl emerged from the incident unharmed, police said.

'Just startled, very scared,' said Deputy Amber Leist.
