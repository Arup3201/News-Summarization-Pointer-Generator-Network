Savvy: Mandy Willis, 55, took a call from a man claiming to be a Microsoft security expert named 'David' from Pakistan, but realised it was a scam

A mother-of-two claims she convinced a conman to give up his criminal lifestyle - after he tried to scam her into handing over personal information over the phone.

Mandy Willis, 55, took a call from a man claiming to be a Microsoft security expert named 'David' from Pakistan, who said that he needed access to her computer in order to fix a virus.

But Ms Willis, from Bristol, said that she realised it was a scam designed to trick her into giving him access to the computer - and the sensitive information stored on it.

Rather than hang up the phone, the party planner decided to chat to the caller - asking him why he made a living from ripping people off.

She told him that this was his 'wake up call' and urged him to give up his life of crime and look for a job that would 'make his children proud'.

Ms Willis, who lives with her partner, claimed that he called her back 10 days later saying that he had left his days as a conman behind him and was now on the hunt for a legitimate job.

She said: 'This man had gone off the path and he just needed a little nudge back on.

'When you deal with it in a horrible way you feel cross afterwards - it's a residue that stays with you.

'When I dealt with it in a positive way I felt much nicer - it's a good thing for everyone.'

Ms Willis, who used to slam the phone down on cold callers, added that she spoke to David just days after she made a decision that she would be nicer to them.

She said: 'I didn't have long to think about how I was going to deal with it differently.

'He started saying he was from Microsoft and there was a virus on my computer and went on like that in the way they do.

'But I started to talk over him. I said "do you really want to help me? I'm not sure that you really do". Gradually he went quiet and started listening to me.

'I said to him "I think you know that this is not truthful, and not honest, and not the path you should be choosing".

'It sound like a lecture now I think about it, and he went really quiet and I thought he was going to put down the phone but he said to me "I think about that every day".' 

New tack: Ms Willis, who lives with her partner in Bristol, said decided to treat callers with more kindness just days before 'David' phoned. The mother-of-two claims to have convinced him to give up his criminal lifestyle

Ms Willis claimed that she told the man this was his 'wake up call' and urged him to walk out on the scam and find legitimate work.

She added: 'I told him "You're never going to be happy or proud doing a job like this".

'This scam isn't going to catch out people like me, but it might catch out someone who is not computer literate, like my mother - that's people like your grandparents.

'He said "yes" and I said that he should do something that makes his children proud.

'We wished each other a good day and I thought that was that.'

But around ten days later she said that she received a call from 'David', who told her he had put his criminal life in his past.

She said: 'First of all I thought it was another scam phone call but he asked "do you remember me?" and I realised who it was.

'He said he had phoned me up to tell me that he had left his job. I told him I thought that was amazing and thanked him for phoning me.

'I asked him how it made him feel and he said he can finally sleep at night. It's just wonderful.'

Ms Willis is now urging other people to engage with phone scammers in an attempt to get them to turn their back on their criminal ways.
