Former Sky Sports commentator Ross McFarlane who is tonight locked up accused of breaching a child pornography sex offenders order - just four weeks after a judge spared him jail

A Sky Sports commentator who was spared jail just four weeks ago for paedophile offences was behind bars today after police re-arrested him.

Former professional golfer Ross McFarlane has been charged with three counts of breaching a Sexual Offences Prevention Order.

He will appear in custody before a judge tomorrow morning.

The 52-year-old was spared jail on January 30 by Judge Johannah Cutts who gave him a suspended sentence despite pointing out that within four months of an earlier conviction he was again making indecent images of children.

'While the sexual offences prevention order did not stop you, it did do its job as police became aware of what was happening,' she told him.

McFarlane, from Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, will appear before Judge Francis Sheridan tomorrow morning charged with again breaching the court order in relation to child sex offences.

A spokesman for Thames Valley Police confirmed that McFarlane had been charged on Friday, February 21 with three counts of breaching a sex offender order.

He appeared before a special magistrates court hearing the next day, where he was remanded in custody.

He will appear before Judge Sheridan at Aylesbury Crown Court via a video-link from prison tomorrow for a preliminary hearing of the breach charges.

McFarlane was previously sentenced at the same court on January 30 for possession of 162 indecent images of children and given 10 months in prison, suspended for two years.

He was also given a 10-year order banning him from contact with children under 16 without parental permission and was also ordered to sign onto the Sex Offenders Register for 10 years.

The latest breaches were believed to involve contact with children.

A regular fixture on Sky viewers' screens since 2001, McFarlane became a professional golfer in 1979 and won the Deutsche Bank Open of Europe in 1997, his only European Tour tournament win.

That year he achieved his highest ranking of 26th on the tour.

His father Noel played for Manchester United's youth side in the mid-1950s which featured many members of the Busby Babes side killed in the Munich air crash in 1958.

At the court hearing in January, McFarlane's defence barrister Helen Warren told Judge Cutts: 'He is horrified to find himself here and is extremely upset, not just for himself but for those that know him.'

She said McFarlane had sought rehabilitation and counselling since his arrest.

'He is very ashamed of himself and what he has put his family through,' she added.

A spokesman for Sky Sports said at the time that it had been unaware of McFarlane's convictions and added that he had been used 'sporadically', around 10 times per year.

'Ross was an occasional, freelance golf expert and, of course, he will not be appearing again,' the spokesman said.
