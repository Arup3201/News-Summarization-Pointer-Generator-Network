A rambling drink driver who flipped his car on Christmas Eve told police his smashed windscreen was an 'old injury' and he was just trying to do a U-turn.

Christopher Squires, 28, was caught on camera slurring his words so badly he could barely get them out of his mouth - before adding: 'I've had a few drinks but I'm not drunk.'

He was banned from driving for 20 months and fined £320 - as police released the video of his unconvincing explanation as a warning to others.

'Uh, uh, uh...': Rambling drink driver Christopher Squires gave an unconvincing account of how his VW Polo was smashed up on a country road - insisting the  windscreen was 'old damage' and he was doing a U-turn

Squires said: 'It's an old thingy, it's not a new thingy, it's not a new injury, this is an old thing like, simple as that like, it's an old thingy, it's an old injury to the car, it's not a new one that's it... I'm not drunk'

A member of the public found Squires behind the wheel of his VW Polo after it flipped and came to rest the right way up at 1.40am on December 24.

He was on a rural road on the South Downs near Fenhurst, West Sussex - five miles from his home in the village of Lodsworth.

Police were alerted and breathalysed him after the short filmed conversation. They quickly found he was more than twice the drink drive limit.

When an officer arrived and asked  if he was injured, Squires said: 'No I'm fine, ehm the car's quite a bit [he mumbles a lot] not a problem mate, sorry.

'I was trying to turn it round that's all, like, there's nothing. Obviously it's messed up but yeah, no, there's no problem mate, so I put the handbrake on, yeah, no, it's a bit like, there's no damage at all really.

Dangerous: A headlamp was knocked out of the side of the car, which police believe flipped over in the crash

'That's old, old, old damage really that's all. It's an old injury, literally, I was just trying to turn it round like and go back down the road. It's got no petrol in it basically so I was just trying to spin it round that's all.

'It's an old thingy, it's not a new thingy, it's not a new injury, this is an old thing like, simple as that like, it's an old thingy, it's an old injury to the car, it's not a new one that's it.

'I just tried to turn the car round and basically I've been caught haven't I trying to turn the car round.

The police officer said he could smell alcohol, to which Squires replied: 'Uh, uh, uh, I haven't got a licence, I'm a provisional licence that's it, and I tried to turn it round and that's it, so fair enough.

When the officer started to caution him he said: 'Yeah, don't worry about it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah that's fine don't worry about it, I've had a few drinks but I'm not drunk'.

Police said he later gave a fake name before criticising the officers for breathalysing him.

Squires was banned from driving for 20 months and fined £320 after his 'ridiculous attempts to avoid justice'

Squires pleaded guilty to drink-driving, driving without a licence and driving without insurance when he appeared at Crawley Magistrates' Court on January 6.

He was banned from driving for 20 months and ordered to pay a £320 fine, £85 costs and a £20 victim surcharge.  

Superintendent Jane Derrick said: 'Squires made a series of ridiculous attempts to avoid justice.

'He claimed the damage to his car was old, when it clearly wasn't. He tried to use a fake name, which we were able to quickly prove was not his own.

'He did not have a full driving licence but said that we were wasting his time and taxpayers' money by arresting and questioning him.

'We will not tolerate drink-driving and the ban given by the magistrates shows they considered his offences to be serious as well.'
