Interstate-95's northeast corridor - which covers Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston - may see snow  on Friday and Saturday, Accuweather reported.

'Unlike many storms this winter, this particular one has the potential to bring a foot of snow to some locations, where rain fails to mix in,' the weather outlet's Chief Meteorologist Elliot Abrams predicted on the website.

Abrams also said that 'Where the snow is heavy and wet, there could be trees coming down with power outages.'   

The storm is expected to be a 'snow, rain, or snow/rain mix, rather than an extended period of freezing rain,' according to Accuweather.

Wet and dangerous roads covered with snow are expected on 1-81 between Virginia and Pennsylvania, the website reported.

The Weather Channel has christened the storm Iola, after a figure in Greek mythology. 

The television channel predicted that Washington, D.C., New York City and Boston would see a wintry mix on Saturday, with temperatures in the 30s and 40s. 

Additionally, the channel predicted Washington, D.C., would experience 1 - 3 inches of snow from Friday to Saturday, with both Philadelphia and New York at 3 - 5 inches and Boston with 5 - 8 inches.  

Protection: A woman in Santa Fe, New Mexico, was seen trying to shield herself from the snow on Wednesday. More snow is predicted in New Mexico through Wednesday night and on Thursday 

Southern start: Parts of New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma were predicted to experience snow Wednesday overnight due to Winter Storm Iola

Showers? Similar weather is predicted to continue on Thursday

Bundle up! Both rainfall and a mix of precipitation are predicted for multiple states on Thursday, according to The Weather Channel

Hard hit? As many as eight inches of snow may fall in Boston from Friday to Saturday, with Bangor, Maine forecast for between eight and twelve inches 

Snowy already: People were seen in Bridgeton, New Jersey, outside in the snow. New Jersey be one of the areas affected by a potential winter storm this weekend 

The National Weather Service's New York office said on its website 'A coastal storm Saturday and Saturday night could result in either a significant snowfall across the region...or significant icing across the region. There remains a high level of uncertainty with regards to the track of the low...and this will greatly impact the type and amount of precipitation.' 

The weather service's Boston office predicted between one and two inches of snow Wednesday night for parts of Cape Cod and Martha's Vineyard through Thursday morning.

It also forecast that 'A significant coastal storm is expected Saturday into Saturday night...but the rain/snow line and northwest extent of heavy precipitation remains highly uncertain.

'The greatest threat for heavy wet snow appears to be near the just west of the I-95 corridor...in the higher terrain outside of I-495 into northern Rhode Island and northeastern Connecticut...but this area is also very close to the rain/snow line. If the track shifts a bit further west...this area could end up with mainly rain with snow further back into the interior.

'A track further east would result in a higher risk for wet snow across the cape and islands...but the rest of the region would see less snow and possibly a complete shut out in northwest Massachusetts. "If" heavy wet snow does come to fruition for a portion of the region...there would be the risk for some downed tree limbs/isolated power outages.

'There is also is the potential for a period of strong to damaging northerly wind gusts Saturday night across the cape and islands.'
