A California man who uncannily resembles a caveman has been arrested after he threw a spear at a passing car.

Jeffery Allen Jones, 56, was booked into a Sacramento jail on Tuesday night after he was spotted launching the unusual weapon into traffic.

A witness called police at around 7:38 p.m. to report that a man standing in the road had thrown a spear at a passing vehicle.

Yawn? Jeffery Allen Jones, 56, was booked into a Sacramento jail on Tuesday night after he was spotted launching the unusual weapon into traffic

According to Sacramento police, the spear became lodged in the car after hitting its front fender.

It's unclear who was driving the car or whether Jones knew the motorist. Police presume it was a random attack.

Officers arrived on the scene and, after a brief search, located the suspect nearby.

Jones was booked into jail for assault with a deadly weapon and is being held.

The incident took place on Auburn Boulevard and Annadale Lane.

There were no reports of any injuries.

The spear is 6-foot long and weighs about 30 pounds.

It was put into evidence, according to officers. Police did not say what the spear was made of.

Jones has had six previous arrests for evading his Regional Transit fare and another time for trespassing, according to Fox News.

In his latest mug shot, Jones has his eyes closed and his mouth wide open. He is sporting long hair and a bushy, greying beard.
