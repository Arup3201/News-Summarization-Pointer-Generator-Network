Hundreds of mourners braved cold and rainy weather yesterday to honor an eight-year-old Pennsylvania girl - who had been serenaded by thousands of Christmas carolers just days before she died of cancer on Christmas morning.

In contrast to the drab weather, many of the mourners wore bright pink, orange or green for Delaney Brown's viewing Sunday at the request of her parents, to honor what they called her 'fashionista style.'

'Today's about Laney and it's about 
the impact she had on a community and the incredible love of her family 
and her indomitable spirit, and her fight till the end,' family 
spokesman Chris Winters said.

'Today's a recognition of what she brought to the world', Winters told The Reading Eagle.

Delaney, whose nickname was Laney, died on Christmas morning from a rare form of leukemia.

One of the West Reading second-grader's last wishes had been for a huge holiday singalong.

Thousands appeared outside her family's home on Dec. 21 to sing Christmas carols.

Shortly
 afterward, the family's Facebook page showed a picture of Laney giving 
two thumbs up with the text: 'I can hear you now!!! Love you!'

On
 Sunday, a line of people holding umbrellas to shield themselves from 
the rain outside the Kuhn Funeral Home in West Reading, Pennsylvania, 
stood with heads bowed or stared at posters of Delaney as they waited to
 write a few kind words to the Browns.

Touching: Over 4,000 people said they'd attend Delaney's sing-along and photos show a huge crowd outside the ailing 8-year-old's Pennsylvania home just days before Christmas

Mitzi
 Munoz, 40, of Reading, who wore a hoodie emblazoned with hot pink, had 
tears in her eyes as she talked about the impact of the girl's story on 
her.

'Laney just touched my 
heart so much. It's hard to explain,' she said. 'I don't know if I met 
her in a store or saw her outside her house one day while she was 
playing, but she inspired me.'

Christi Kuprij-Brown, 45, of Reading, said Laney's story inspired her to get involved in raising cancer awareness.

'Now it's time for me to do something,' she said. 'This has really made me aware I need to do more in my community.'

The family is still struggling to come to terms with the little girl's loss.

'This
 house is still full of all the medical machines and her birthday 
presents, her Christmas presents,' posted Laney's father, Jeremiah 
Brown, just after she died last week.

'There
 used to be a little girl normally already sitting on our couch watching
 TV when I wake up early in the morning. My life will never be the same 
since that little angel touched it.'

Laney Brown is survived by her parents and two siblings.

'Not
 only do we have the emotional anguish of losing our child but we also 
have to comfort our other children and let them know it will be okay 
even when you aren't sure of it yourself,' wrote Jennifer Brown on 
Facebook.

'Her little 
sister is taking it very hard. She woke up this morning with thoughts of
 opening Christmas presents with her sister and was met by our sorrow 
filled faces waiting to tell her that her best friend in this world, her
 sister, is no longer sleeping comfortably in her bed downstairs but is 
now in heaven.'

Rare: Delaney has a serious and very rare form of childhood leukemia called acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with monosomy 7

Bucket list: Another wish on Delaney's bucket list was to be a baby sitter, which she got to fulfill when a friend of the family brought over their 7-week-old baby for her to watch over, though it left her weak

Laney suffered from a rare form of 
childhood cancer called acute myeloid leukemia with monosomy 7, â€˜making 
her quite rare,â€™ according to the Facebook page.

Just 10 children a year are diagnosed with the illness in America.

The
 sweet but tough little girl, who loved fashion and swimming in the 
ocean, went through five rounds of radiation and a stem cell transplant.

Singer Taylor Swift, 
who grew up in the neighboring town of  Wyomissing, had helped Delaney 
knock an item off her bucket list before she passed away.

The
 Make-A-Wish Foundation helped connect Swift with the Brown family 
earlier in December when it became clear that Delaney has very little 
time left.

Delaney was diagnosed with leukemia in May and underwent five rounds of radiation and a stem cell transplant
