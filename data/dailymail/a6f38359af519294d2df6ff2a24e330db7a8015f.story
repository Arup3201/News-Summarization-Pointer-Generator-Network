These magical images look like intricate works of art. But they are in fact a series of different kinds of moss which smothers trees - transforming branches into a thick spongy green layer.

A nature photographer has taken the close-up photographs, showing the vast differences in pattern, colour and texture in moss around the world.

Their tiny, simple leaves appear in different shapes and sizes and some are even a rustic, golden brown colour.

Warren Krupsaw, from northern Virginia, US, has been a nature photographer for more than 50 years and took the beautiful pictures

The miniature leaves group together, and from a distance, they transform the colour of a tree from brown to green.

Warren Krupsaw, from northern Virginia, US, has been a nature photographer for more than 50 years.

The 70-year-old said: 'Moss pictures are taken whenever and wherever interesting specimens are encountered.

'From the vast moss-covered lava beds in Iceland, to mossy landscapes in Norway, to Kauai, Hawaii, to my own garden in Virginia.'

The photographer said that he does not go looking specifically for moss.

He added: But if encountered, I'll certainly check it out.

The photographer said most people ignore it and pass it by, but 'after closer examination, unusual colours, patterns, shapes and forms reveal themselves'

Mr Krupsaw, a father-of-two, said he finds moss fascinating and travels around the world capturing it in its finest light

'By its nature, moss requires a certain modicum of moisture so it's less likely to occur in drier environments, while also favouring warmer conditions.

'In the Hoh Rainforest, Washington, for example, the predominant Sitka Spruce that grow 100 metres tall are adorned with epiphytic moss.

'In other moist environments, moss can occur on just about any surface from concrete to roofing.'

The resulting pictures are almost unrecognisable from their subject matter, as they erupt in colour and texture

The close up of this textured moss looks almost like a forest of towering trees, swaying in the breeze

By its nature, moss requires a modicum of moisture so it is less likely to occur in drier environments, while also favouring warmer conditions

There are approximately 12,000 species of moss. While it is considered a weed in many cultures, in Japan, it is actively encouraged to grow

Mr Krupsaw said what he liked about the pictures, is that they don't look like moss at all. The incredibly detailed images make the plant appear like trees in their own right

Moss does not have flowers or seeds. Instead their simple leaves cover thin stems. It can also produce spore capsules. These appear as beak-like capsules borne aloft on thin stalks

He continued: 'It can be a fascinating subject matter due to a couple of reasons.

'Most people ignore it and pass it by, and after closer examination, unusual colours, patterns, shapes and forms reveal themselves.

'What I like about the pictures is that they don't look like moss at all.'
