The president of a Seattle university has come under fire from conservatives for asking students how to make the campus less white.

In a controversial questionnaire making the rounds of Western Washington University, President Bruce Shephard asked students, 'How do we make sure that in future years we are not as white as we are today?'

Shephard has been vocal about his goal of creating a more diverse faculty and student body since he took office six years ago.

Hard questions: Western Washington University's Bruce Shephard is asking staff and students how to attract students from a more diverse range of backgrounds

In the university's opening convocation in 2012, he said: 'Every year, from this stage and at this time, you have heard me say that, if in decades ahead, we are as white as we are today, we will have failed as university.'

Despite backlash from conservative pundits, Shephard is unapologetic about his stance.

'I needed to provoke attention to the changing demography of our state, and when you use words like "white," that does get people's attention,' he told CBS.

In a recent blog post, Shephard clarified his position.

'High 
school graduation numbers in our state are flat and are projected to 
remain so. Within those flat graduation numbers, the percentage coming 
from families from diverse ethnic and racial groups where parents have 
not gone to college is rapidly increasing,' he wrote.

All white now: The university has traditionally drawn white students from upper middle class backgrounds, a group that is diminishing

Support: Faculty and students have been supportive of Shephard's diversity goals

The
 aim, he wrote, is not to keep white students out, it's to attract more 
students from other backgrounds that reflect the state's changing 
demography. The pool from which the university traditionally draws its 
students is getting smaller - meaning that to survive, the school needs 
to diversify.

'It is 
about whether we will have the wisdom, the culture, the commitment, to 
be able to attract a sufficient number of students from diverse 
backgrounds,' he wrote.

'In
 the decades ahead, should we be as white as we are today, we will be 
relentlessly driven toward mediocrity; or, become a sad shadow of our 
current self.'

Shephard
 has incurred the wrath of sites such as Campus Reform, a self-styled 
'campus watchdog' for conservative students, which cast Shephard's goal 
of racial diversity as an attempt to discourage white students from 
attending the school.

'I think he's being very insensitive to how people are perceived based on the color of their skin,' said editor-in-chief Caleb Bonham.

Unapologetic: Shephard says that his choice of words was intended to fuel discussion

A Twitter response stated 'Dear Sir: You need to resign immediately!  Your white mediocrity is a stain to the fabric of WWU.  Usher in the future. Defund WWU.'

Shephard said his wording was designed to provoke a response.

'Understanding requires conversations on  our campus that are wide and 
deep, thoughtful and informed.  And, if being provocative helps 
stimulate  those conversations well, then, guess I am merely doing my 
job,' he wrote on the blog.

Only about 20 per cent of Western Washington University's 15,000 students come from minority backgrounds.

Shephard says he has received many messages of support from staff and students, but he has increased security from campus police following threats.

Early Wednesday evening, Shepard and WWU student body president Carly Roberts responded to critics.

'We will not waste a moment’s time responding to extremist media and the hate mongers they pander to. We believe that difficult questions must be answered thoughtfully and deliberately,' they said, reports Seattle PI.

Racial background is not a factor in admissions at Western Washington University.
