The newborn baby who initially survived a horrific car accident
in Brooklyn on Sunday that killed both his parents weighed just over two pounds when he died today from low blood pressure, a relative told MailOnline.

The infant boy’s parents, Nachman and Raizy Glauber, both
21, were killed in a grisly hit-and-run crash in the borough’s Williamsburg
neighborhood. Monday would have been Raizy's 22nd birthday.

A family member 
said she rushed to the hospital as soon as she got the phone call about 
the crash and stayed by the baby's side until he died.

Nachman and Raizy Glauber, both 21, were killed when their livery cab crashed. Raizy was seven-months-pregnant and her son survived for one day before passing away, weighing just two pounds

‘He only weighed two and a half pounds,’ the woman, who did not want to give her name, told
MailOnline. ‘The family tried to have him transferred to Columbia Medical
Center, but it wasn’t possible.'

She said that his tiny heart gave up because of his extreme
prematurity and low blood pressure, and he died around 5am.

The Glauber family member said that it was cripplingly
tragic to lose all three of the young lives. ‘They had a beautiful life
together waiting to have this baby,’ she said.

‘We loved them dearly.’

The infant’s death has compounded her grief, she said. ‘I’m
still in shock. It hits me today even more – I really wanted to save this
baby.’

The baby, who was to be named Nachman in honor of his father, was
buried today near the graves of his parents in a cemetery in the village
of Kiryas Joel within the town of Monroe, New York.

This is Yetev Lev D'Satmar, the Williamsburg synagogue where the funerals of Nachman and Raizy Glauber were held on Sunday

Raizy’s high school teacher, a woman who asked to be
identified only as Mrs Schwartz, told MailOnline that the young woman was
bright and confident, and that Raizy’s mother was a friend of the family.

‘She was a bright girl, very beloved, she scored very well
academically. The image that comes to mind is a girl who was impeccably
dressed, she always came ready to class and asked deep questions.’

Mrs Schwartz said that she did not personally know Raizy’s
husband.

‘But she always said he was generous and cordial and wanted
to be a good father.’

'I still can't believe this happened. I was
hoping there would be a legacy.'

Mrs Schwartz said that she last saw Raizy at a wedding on
February 13. ‘She looked happy, she looked beautiful,’ the teacher said.

‘It is tragic that her child died on the day that she would
have turned 22,’ Mrs Schwartz added, saying that she kept detailed records of
all her past students and had somehow retained the young woman’s birth date –
March 4, 1991.

Glauber’s first cousin, who requested her first name not be used, said she witnessed
firsthand the courtship of Raizy and Nachman.

‘We do a lot of research before meeting,’ she said,
explaining that members of the sect talk at length over compatibility and other
characteristics before a potential couple is introduced to one another.

‘My aunt called me – she knew this girl (Raizy). She
was really looking for a quality girl for her son (Nachman).’

The Glaubers were married in January 2012 at the Pardes
Feige, a Jewish event center across the street from where their funerals would
be held only a year later.

‘I still can’t believe this happened,’ she said. ‘I was
hoping there would be a legacy.’

Raizy Glauber was a member of a prominent rabbinical family.
Her husband had been studying Torah at a rabbinical college. Nachman’s family
had founded a successful clothing line for Orthodox Jews.

The couple’s tragedy began late Sunday night when Raizy –
who was seven months pregnant – said she was feeling ill and thought she might
be in labor.

According to Sara Glauber, Nachman Glauber’s cousin, they called a
livery cab to transport them to the hospital.

The livery cab – a Toyota Camry that had not yet been
approved by the city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission – had a stop sign at Kent Ave., but it is unclear if he actually came to a halt.

Suspect: Julio Acevedo, 44, is wanted for allegedly driving the BMW that crashed into the couple's livery cab. Acevedo served time for manslaughter and was arrested for alleged drunken driving just two weeks ago

A man today identified by the NYPD as Julio Acevedo, 44,
allegedly slammed a BMW into the cab as it made its way northbound up Kent
Ave., T-boning the car and causing Raizy to fly through the windshield.

Her husband was trapped in the car and was pronounced dead
at the scene. Raizy was rushed to Bellevue Hospital Center where her baby was
delivered via emergency C-section.

The young mother was pronounced dead on arrival.

Law enforcement officials are on a hunt for Acevedo, who is
a convicted killer already found guilty of drunk driving, according to
DNAInfo.com.

Sources told the website that Acevedo was released without
bail only two weeks ago for a drunk driving incident involving road rage. He
was found with a blood alcohol level of 0.13, nearly twice the legal limit.

A witness at the scene told DNAInfo that he saw Acevedo
limping at the scene following the accident, but said that the driver then ran
off.

The livery cab driver, 32-year-old Pedro Nunez, was released
from the hospital Sunday evening, having only suffered minor injuries.

Acevedo’s estranged mother told the New York Daily News that
her son would likely turn himself in today.

At first blush, those walking along the streets of Williamsburg seemed to be going about business as usual following the weekend’s horrific events.

Thousands gathered to mourn the couple Sunday at their funerals in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Their son survived following surgery but tragically died just over 24 hours later

Where thousands of members of the Satmar sect gathered yesterday in front of Yetev Lev D'Satmar Synagogue on Hooper St., today only scholars filtered their way in and out, many of them with their Torahs tucked under one arm.

Hassidic men walked brusquely along the street to avoid the cold breeze brought in by the East River and women wearing long skirts and ballet flats pushed their children along in strollers.

However, there was a decidedly somber mood hanging over the community as they heard the news of the baby's death this morning.

A childhood friend of Raizy spoke today with MailOnline and remembered her infectious smile and generous spirit.

‘She was a wonderful person,’ said 23-year-old Faiga G., who requested that her last name not be published.  ‘We grew up on the same block.’

When asked how the close-knit community was handling the tragic loss of three lives, she said: ‘We are shocked.

‘I feel disbelief. This is a tragedy beyond words, but we're all in this together. All with each other.’
