An apparent confession made by a British corporate investigator and his American wife arrested as part of a clampdown on the trade in information in China has been broadcast on state television.

Peter Humphrey and Yingzeng Yu, a married couple, reportedly appeared on China's central broadcaster CNTV admitting to illegally gathering personal information on individuals in China.

The couple are part of an industry of 
investigators who help corporate clients screen potential partners and 
employees or watch for embezzlement and other employee misconduct.

Peter Humphrey and Yingzeng Yu appeared on China's central broadcaster CNTV apparently admitting to illegally gathering personal information on individuals in China

According to The Times, they appeared on television in handcuffs and wearing orange vests, with their faces blurred, after police announced the arrest of the two corporate investigators who work in Shanghai, on charges of improperly selling personal information about Chinese citizens.

In the broadcast Humphrey says: 'To obtain this information, I sometimes used illegal means.

'I want to apologize to the Chinese government.'

James Zimmerman, managing partner of the Beijing office of the law firm Sheppard Mullin Richter & Hampton, said: 'The opaque nature of the investigation 
and detention of the Humphreys is troubling at best and puts a serious 
chilling effect on legitimate efforts to investigate even benign, public
information.'

Several dozen reports prepared by Humphrey and Yu for corporate clients contained information that 'seriously violated the legitimate rights of citizens,' the Shanghai police department said in a statement. It said they were formally arrested on August 16.

That included home addresses and information on family members, real estate and vehicles, the statement said. It said they were sold to clients including manufacturers, law firms and financial institutions.

The arrests coincided with the announcement of an investigation into possible bribery of doctors by GlaxoSmithKline employees, prompting suggestions their case might be linked, but today's announcement made no mention of that

Humphrey's and Yu's firm, ChinaWhys Ltd., says on its website it 'specializes in discreet risk mitigation solutions, consulting and investigation services' aimed at 'walking multinationals through the labyrinth of opportunity, risk and unfamiliar cultural environment.'

Humphrey, a former reporter for the Reuters news agency, has worked as an investigator for the past 14 years in Asia, focusing on white-collar crime prevention, fraud investigation and crisis mitigation, according to the website.

It says Yu has worked for or advised companies in the United States, Hong Kong and China in technology, medical products and other industries over a 25-year business career.

and detention of the Humphreys is troubling at best and puts a serious 
chilling effect on legitimate efforts to investigate even benign, public
information'

Humphrey and Yu are accused of paying £80 to £200 per item of personal information, the official Xinhua News Agency said.

The British Embassy in Beijing confirmed last week that Humphrey was arrested but gave no details of charges. The embassy said it was providing unspecified consular assistance to his family.

The American Embassy in Beijing said earlier that diplomats visited Yu on July 16. A spokesman said he had no additional information.

The detentions coincided with the announcement in July of an investigation into possible bribery of doctors by employees of pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline. That prompted suggestions their case might be linked to Glaxo, but today's announcement made no mention of that.

The announcement said Shanghai police are investigating 126 people on suspicion of improperly gathering personal information and have detained 35.

Chinese companies have reacted angrily to disclosures of information by investigators.

In the highest-profile case, a U.S. firm, Muddy Waters Research, accused Chinese forestry company Sino-Forest Corp. of exaggerating the value of its assets.

Sino-Forest's shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange plunged in value. Canadian police launched an investigation of the company, which filed a lawsuit accusing Muddy Waters of defamation.
