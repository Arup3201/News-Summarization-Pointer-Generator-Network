Former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford released a full page ad in a local newspaper explaining why he was caught leaving his ex-wife's house, the revelation of which started a domino effect for his congressional campaign.

He didn't stop explaining his side of the story with the 1,200-word ad either, as he included his real cell phone number in the 'personal message', encouraging voters to call him with questions.

'I think that people always want to know the real story, the full story,' he told MailOnline by phone.

'Context matters': Former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford told MailOnline that he released a full page ad in order to get his side of the trespassing story out to the voters before the election

The Republican former governor was the subject of an ethics investigation after he was caught returning to his home state after a trip to visit his mistress in Argentina even though he told his staff he was hiking on the Appalachian Trail. The affair lead to his fall from grace, and eventual divorce from his wife Jenny.

Now the details of their divorce have come to light after she filed a lawsuit against him for a 'pattern' of trespassing after he entered her Sullivans’ Island home without her permission in early February.

Last-ditch effort: Sanford's campaign took out a lengthy ad in a local paper over the weekend as his poll numbers drop just two weeks before the election

That lawsuit led to an explanation from Sanford- who said he was watching the second half of the Super Bowl with his 14-year-old son while his ex was out of town- but that didn't stop the National Republican Congressional Committee from pulling their funding from the race.

And that move came even before Jenny confirmed that the first time that one of the couples' sons met his Argentinian mistress-turned-fiancée was on stage at his primary victory party just weeks ago.

When MailOnline spoke to Mr Sanford on
Monday, he said that he felt the need to take out the lengthy ad in The
Post and Courier in order to make sure that the voters knew the whole 
story.

'I think that context matters,' he said.

The
first reports of the trespassing incident in question drew from the 
court documents that Jenny Sanford's legal team filed, saying that he 
was seen leaving the back door of her Sullivans Island home using his 
cell phone as a flashlight.

'That's a rather spooky story- it would creep anybody out,' he said.

For that reason, he and his campaign staff felt the need to flesh it out more in print, in wordy detail.

'I
did, indeed, watch the second half of the Super Bowl at the beach house
with our 14-year-old son because, as a father, I didn't think he should
sit alone and watch it. Given Jenny was out of town, I tried to reach 
her beforehand to tell her of the situation that had arisen, and met her
at the back steps and told her what had happened under the light of my 
cell phone when she returned,' the ad reads.

The 10-paragraph ad goes on to talk 
about the influx of funding from Democratic political action committees,
backing his competitor Elizabeth Colbert Busch.

It
also talks about his history of cutting government spending, even 
taking the unexpected route of bringing up his frugality when it came to
his trips while serving as the state's governor.

Awkward: Mark Sanford's son is visibly uncomfortable when he was standing next to his father's mistress-turned-fiancee Maria Belen Chapur, a woman he had met for the first time just moments before

Celebration: Sanford leans in for a kiss with his fiancee following his win on Tuesday night

Considering
his ethics charges- of which he was cleared- surrounding the 
extramarital affair stemmed from the cost of his trips to meet his 
mistress, talking about other issues may have seemed like the more 
politically safe option.

One
thing he does not mention in the ad is the report that one of his son's
first meetings with his father's mistress-turned-fiancée was onstage at
his victory party for his primary win earlier this month.

When
asked if the public venue was really the first time that his son had 
met his future stepmother, he said: 'one of them had and one of them 
hadn't'.

'That's the nature of a surprise- I didn't know she was coming,' he said of his fiancée Maria Belen Chapur.

The report of the awkward encounter made news when Jenny Sanford confirmed it on Wednesday.

The
trespassing revelation, family introduction at the victory party and 
the withdrawal of NRCC funding all made for- as, Sanford said in the ad,
‘a rough week’. And now a new poll shows that it has taken its toll.

(left, now running for the state's open congressional seat) is accused 
of trespassing on his ex-wife's property and she confirmed the victory party incident

The Democratic-leaning Public Policy Polling released the latest numbers on Monday saying that Sanford was trailing Mrs Colbert Busch by nine points, with the Democrat winning 50 per cent to the Republican’s 41 per cent.

The poll was conducted between April 19 and 21, two days after the wave of bad news hit the Sanford campaign.

'Elizabeth Colbert Busch is now looking like a clear favorite in the special election,' the poll reads.

'The only question is whether an extremely unpopular Sanford can find some way to make voters like her even less than him in the next two weeks.'
