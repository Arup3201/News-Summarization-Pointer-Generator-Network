Emaciated and riddled with fleas, this is how two German Shepherd dogs looked when they were taken into care.

RSPCA inspectors found the white dogs, named Sapphire and Sammy, had lived in a home smelling of urine and ammonia.

They also found a cat called Tigger which, while not as starved as the dogs, was also thin and infested with fleas.

Neglected: One of the starved German Shepherd dogs that lived in a home smelling of urine and ammonia in Carlisle, Cumbria

Poor condition: RSPCA found the German Shepherd dogs to be underweight and infested with fleas

The pets' owners, Colin Chester and Kirsty Kendall, have been banned from keeping animals after they were convicted in court of failing to meet their needs.

An investigation began after Chester, 35, and Kendall, 22, of Carlisle, Cumbria, contacted German Shepherd rescue charity Second Chance to ask it to take a dog.

When the couple handed over Sapphire, a bitch believed to be less than a year old, charity workers were so concerned by the animal's condition that they took it to a vet and alerted the RSPCA.

Inspector Chris Towler, from the RSPCA's Cumbria and North Lancashire branch, went to the couple's home with police and was alarmed by what he found.

'We found a further dog in the premises,' he said. 'It was an adult female, white German Shepherd by the name of Sammy.

'This dog was also emaciated and running with fleas and the property smelled of urine and ammonia.'Tigger the cat was also in a poor condition.

All three pets have since been rehomed.

Suffering: The pets' owners, Colin Chester and Kirsty Kendall, have been banned from keeping animals after they were convicted in court of failing to meet their needs

Chester appeared at Carlisle Magistrates’ Court on July 13, where he pleaded guilty to one charge of failing to meet the needs of the three animals, and one charge of causing suffering to the two dogs due to their emaciated condition.

He was banned from keeping animals for five years and was ordered to complete 210 hours of unpaid work.

He was also ordered to pay £500 towards the RSPCA’s prosecution costs.

Kendall denied the same allegations, but was later convicted at the same court.

She was banned from keeping animals, given a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £300 towards the RSPCA's costs.

Mr Towler said: 'Throughout the case, lack of finance was clearly an issue.

'While I appreciate that in these times everybody’s tight with money, there are plenty of assisting charities out there who could have helped to prevent this matter and the ultimate suffering of the animals concerned.'

Mr Towler praised Second Chance for their initial action, and for their subsequent help in fostering and then rehoming all three pets.

'It has been a good outcome for all three animals and I hope Mr Chester and Miss Kendall think very hard about what they have done,' he added.

Justice: Colin Chester and Kirsty Kendall were sentenced at Carlisle Magistrates' Court
