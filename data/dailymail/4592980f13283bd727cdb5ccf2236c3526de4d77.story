The RSPCA is trying to find a dog owner who let the hair of a poodle-type pooch become so matted around her eyes that she went blind - and then left it in a box outside a vets with the message 'dog inside' scrawled on the front.

Horrified vets that found the poor animal described the dog's ordeal as the ‘worst case’ of neglect they have ever seen.

The elderly animal - which was extremely skinny - was abandoned outside a vets in Sheffield, south Yorkshire.

Appalling neglect: Peggy's matted hair gave her agonising eye ulcers and she eventually went blind

Heartbreaking: Vets couldn't save Peggy's eyesight and decided that removing them and sewing her eyelids shut was their only option

When staff opened up the box they found a dog who was unable to blink.

The matted hair had led to agonising eye ulcers, which had caused her to go blind in both eyes.

She also had a mouth full of rotten teeth, damp feet from standing in her own excrement and was severely malnourished.

Anne Bernabe, 35, who works at Highfield Veterinary Centre, said: ‘We were all horrified by what we saw when we opened the box - it was extremely upsetting to see.

‘It’s definitely the worst case of neglect any of us have ever witnessed in our entire careers, it’s just unimaginable how anybody could do this to a defenceless, elderly animal.’

The pooch, thought to be between eight and 13-years-old, was found by staff at around 8am on the morning of April 28 - and it is thought she had been dumped some time after 12pm on the Sunday.

Saved: Molly Graham with Princess Peggy the poodle, who is now recovering well

She was immediately rushed inside, washed, trimmed, and fed-up on regular dog food.

Sadly, her eyes were so badly damaged that vets decided they would have to be removed entirely.

Three days after her arrival - and once she had been ‘fed up’ with lots of dog food and treats - she had both eyes removed and her eyelids sewn shut, as well as having her 32 rotten teeth removed.

Vet Molly Graham was so upset by what had happened to the dog - now named Princess Peggy - that she has been fostering her.

Molly said: ‘She is such a sweetie and all the staff were so upset by what has happened to her - but she is doing amazingly well despite her ordeal.

New beginning: Vet Ms Graham said Princess Peggy is 'doing amazingly well despite her ordeal'

‘It is clear the dog had been in this condition for a while and the hair over her eyes was so matted that both eyes had ulcerated causing blindness.’

The incident has been reported to the RSPCA and inspector Jennie Ronksley is now looking into it.

She said: ‘It is horrific to think this poor elderly girl has been left in such a terrible condition and she must have been in so much pain.

‘There is simply no excuse for allowing an animal to get in this way and I am now appealing to anyone who has any information regarding who the owner may be.

‘I really want to find the person responsible for this and I would appeal to anyone who has any information to call me on the RSPCA inspector appeal line on 0300 123 8018.’
