Victims of crime are to be given the power to appeal against decisions not to charge suspects.

Top prosecutor Keir Starmer said victims are treated as ‘bystanders’ in the justice system with little say about what happens in their cases.

A new Victims' Right to Review will cover any decision taken by the Crown Prosecution not to press charges, potentially affecting up to 75,000 cases every year.

Bystanders: Keir Starmer, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said too many victims felt they had only a 'walk-on part' in their cases

It will mean any victim of crime, including bereaved family members or other representatives, will be able to ask the CPS to look again at a case following a decision not to charge, to discontinue proceedings or offer no evidence.

Mr Starmer, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said a ‘realistic prospect of conviction test’ would ensure the new measures did not tie up the criminal justice system in extensive reviews.

‘This is big step forward for victims, for many years they’ve been treated as bystanders in the criminal justice process with a sort of with a walk on part if their case goes ahead,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

‘This is about giving them greater confidence in the decision that starts the process in the first place.

‘If we take a decision not to prosecute then that’s very significant from a victim’s perspective and this new initiative enables them to say to the Crown Prosecution Service “I’d like that decision reviewed”.’

Around 75,000 cases do not proceed every year, but Mr Starmer said that in many of those the victim will ‘readily accept the decision not to prosecute, they may have even indicated beforehand they don’t want to support it’.

Around 1,600 people complain each year at
present about a decision not to press charges, and the CPS would expect
this number to rise when the right to review is introduced.

Challenge: Victims will be able to demand a review of decisions by prosecutors not to press charges against suspects in their case

The plans, which have been put out to consultation, come after a Court of Appeal ruling involving a case in which the CPS decided in 2007 not to bring sexual assault charges.

The decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal and in 2011 disabled man Christopher Killick was jailed for three and a half years for sexually abusing two fellow cerebral palsy sufferers.

Intimidated: Justice minister Helen Grant said the criminal justice system makes victims' 'already horrific experiences worse'

The court stated ‘as a decision not to prosecute is in reality a final decision for a victim, there must be a right to seek a review of such a decision’.

Victims' Commissioner Baroness Helen Newlove backed the move, but vowed to challenge any 'shortcomings' in the way it works.

She said: 'On my appointment I was keen to work with Mr Starmer, victims and families of those who have suffered the loss of loved one's to put right this injustice.

'I am pleased that Mr Starmer has listened to the representations I have made on their behalf and today is a positive step forward for victims and their families.'

Javed Khan, chief executive of independent charity Victim Support, said: ‘The Right to Review strengthens the rights of victims during the criminal justice process and is welcomed by Victim Support.

‘Too often victims tell us that they don't have much of a voice in our justice system. This new initiative by the Crown Prosecution Service is a step in the right direction and will help to re-position victims back at the heart of our justice system.’

The CPS only allows prosecutions to begin or continue if there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and it is in the public interest to prosecute.

Decisions not to charge or stop a prosecution on either ground will be open to review.

VRR does not apply to cases where the police have decided to take no further action and a file of evidence has not been submitted to the CPS.

Victims' Minister Helen Grant said: ‘Too often victims feel intimidated and treated as an afterthought by a 'system' that makes their already horrific experiences worse - the Victims' Right to Review is an important step towards changing this.

‘All victims deserve to know that the Criminal Justice System will work as hard as possible to deliver justice for them and help them recover and move on with their lives.

‘That's why if a victim has the strength to come forward, it is right that we give them every possible chance to get the justice they so deserve.’
