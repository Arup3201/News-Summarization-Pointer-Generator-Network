Injuries: Roadrunner the dog needed to have his eyes removed because of the alleged abuse meted out to him by his former owner Kimberly Anderson, 36

According to eyewitnesses, Kimberly Anderson, pictured, threw the 12-pound Tibetan spaniel, from the third-floor balcony of an apartment building in the 1200 block of Independence Avenue in November

But the good news is that the resilient dog is expected to make a good recovery. 

The Kansas City Pet Project, an animal shelter in Missouri, took Roadrunner in after he suffered the horrific injuries at the hands of Anderson.

According to an eyewitness, Anderson took the 12-pound Tibetan spaniel and threw him from the third-floor balcony of an apartment building in the 1200 block of Independence Avenue in November.

The witness also said that Anderson wrapped a leash around the dog's neck, picked him up and slammed him to the ground. 

She then allegedly choked the dog a second time and kicked him, leaving him outside wincing in pain.

Surgeons had to remove the dog's damaged eyes and repair his broken pelvis. 

Since his surgery, he has been healing in a foster home and was neutered last week.

Recovery: The Tibetan spaniel has managed to develop new skills to cope with being blind

Tori Fugate, manager of marketing for The KC Pet Project told The Kansas City Star: 'We wanted to show how well he is doing and show his recovery has just been amazing. He is just doing great.' 

'He is adjusting very, very well. He gets along great with the two other dogs in his foster home. He loves playing with them, and he loves playing with toys.'

'He's just acting like a normal dog,' Fugate said. 'He is very cautious when he moves around and walks around in case he bumps into something. But if he bumps into it, he corrects himself.'
