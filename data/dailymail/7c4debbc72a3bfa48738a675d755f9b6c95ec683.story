Misunderstood? William the Conqueror's reputation might be unwarranted and borne out of a basic accountancy misunderstanding, a historian claims

He is known as a terrifying warrior and ruthless monarch who conquered the Saxon kingdom of England.

But William the Conqueror’s fearsome reputation as a murderous tyrant might be unwarranted and borne out of a basic accountancy misunderstanding.

One historian claims that the problem lies with the definition of the word ‘waste’ in the Domesday Book, which has been misinterpreted and used to tarnish the warrior king’s reputation.

‘In the winter of 1089, William gathered his troops for what would become known as the "Harrying of the North",’ said Dr Rob Wright, a historian at the Place charity in York.

‘Having already swept away the Anglo-Saxon nobility in the South, they hoped to do the same in the rebellious North and the theory goes that they arrived in Yorkshire with just one thing on their minds - mass destruction.

‘By the time they left a few months later, we have been left with a picture of an entire county devastated.

‘There's no doubt the Normans were a fearsome lot, but to blame them for reducing Yorkshire to a wasteland is wide of the mark.

Dr Wright explained that much of what we know about the episode in Yorkshire comes from the Domesday Book of 1086.

Compilers of the Domesday Book (pictured) have written 'waste' next to many of the Yorkshire landholdings and this had led historians to believe that the land was destroyed. However, Dr Wright claims this couldn't have been the case and that 'waste' simply meant the specific lands could not be taxed

William I was the first Norman king of England who reigned from 1066 until his death in 1087.

He famously defeated king Harold at the Battle of Hastings, as depicted in the Bayeux tapestry.

William's final years as king were threatened by rebellions including the invasion of England by the Danes, which led him to respond with violence.

In 1086, William ordered the compilation of the Domesday Book, which was a survey of landowners in England as well as their holdings.

His reign in England is marked by many castles and the settling of new Norman nobility on the land.

In the famous book, which records the 
great land survey of much of England and parts of Wales undertaken so the crown could collect taxes, compilers have 
written ‘waste’ next to many of the Yorkshire landholdings and this had 
led historians to believe that the land was destroyed.

‘However, it's actually much more likely that it means the compilers couldn't put a value on the holding,’ Dr Wright said.

He explained that at the time, estates were merged and divided up again so that trying to trace the owner to collect taxes for the king was very difficult.

‘The entire invading Norman force numbered less than 20,000. In the four months they were here, it would have been logistically impossible for them to ravage such a large area.

‘To have destroyed the number of settlements listed as “waste,” the Normans would have had to pillage all day and all night.’

Another literary source further dented the king’s reputation a few decades later when scholarly monk Simeon of Durham wrote his own account of the conquest.

Dr Wright is keen to restore the king's reputation and said that while he crushed a rebellion with force, he also left Yorkshire some of Western Europe's greatest monuments, such as Rievaulx Abbey, near Helmsley (pictured)

The Harrying of the North was a series of campaigns by William the Conqueror that started in the winter of 1069 to put down revolts in the north of England.

At the time, Sweyn II of Denmark invaded England to support Edgar the Atheling's claim to the throne as the last remaining member of the House of Wessex.

Their combined army broke the Norman hold on the north and William responded by putting down the revolt.

It is popularly claimed that he systematically set about destroying the countryside and villages of north Yorkshire, after sending the Danes home.

It has been said that William slaughtered families and ruined homes, 
crops and animals so that thousands of people died in a famine.

A popular interpretation of the Domesday Book claims that much of Yorkshire was still a wasteland in 1086 - although this is now disputed.

He wrote: ‘It was horrific to behold human corpses decaying in the houses, the streets and the roads, swarming with worms.

‘For no-one was left to bury them in the earth, all being cut off either by the sword or by famine...There was no village inhabited between York and Durham - they became lurking places to wild beasts and robbers.’

Dr Wright believes this account is more fiction than fact and is giving a series of public lectures to restore, or at least improve, the king’s reputation on behalf of the Yorkshire environmental charity, Place, which is based at York St John University.

‘These accounts were written many years after the Harrying of the North and need to be taken with a large pinch of salt,’ he said.

‘For centuries since the Normans have been cast as the villains of the piece and half-truths and suggestions have appeared as fact in encyclopaedias.

‘William did crush a rebellion with force, but we shouldn't forget what the Normans did for us.

‘It was down to them that Yorkshire was left with some of Western Europe's greatest monuments, such as Rievaulx Abbey, near Helmsley.’

But Dr Wright believes it probably meant that land could not be valued and taxes could not be collected

Would have been 'logistically impossible' for the invading Norman force of 20,000 soldiers to ravage such a large area in just four months, he claims
