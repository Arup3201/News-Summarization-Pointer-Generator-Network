Tragedy: Raymond Elsmore worked at the Queen's Inclosure Primary School crossing for 13 years

An 82-year-old lollipop man was killed by a car as he helped a pregnant mother and child to cross the road where he had worked for more than 13 years.

Raymond Elsmore was wearing a high visibility jacket and holding up a sign on his usual patch of road when he was hit by a Nissan Micra.

He sustained severe head injuries and died later in hospital after being
flung against the windscreen of the car.

Lauren Paul, who was driving, has pleaded not guilty to causing death by dangerous driving, claiming she was blinded by the sun.

Miss Paul, of Waterlooville in Hampshire, was on her way back to the college where she worked just after 3pm on December 5 last year when the incident occurred.

Investigations established she had been travelling between 21mph and 28mph.

Portsmouth Crown Court heard Mr Elsmore stepped into Tempest Avenue, Waterlooville, to help a woman and her child across it as he had done many times outside Queen’s Inclosure Primary School.

An accident investigator, who visited the crash scene, said the bright sun could have blended in with a high visibility jacket similar to that worn by Mr Elsmore at the time of the accident.

But Matthew Lawson, prosecuting, said the Highway Code stated that a driver should 'slow down or if necessary stop' if dazzled by bright sunlight.

He added: 'The defendant’s driving at the time fell below what would be expected of a competent and careful driver in all the circumstances.

'The charge is that Miss Paul was driving without due care and attention. All drivers must stop when they see a lollipop man.'

Mr Lawson said the Micra’s windscreen was shattered by the force of the blow and Mr Elsmore was flung down the road on the rebound.

Trial: Lauren Paul, 22, hit Mr Elsmore in her Nissan Micra last year. She claims she was blinded by the sunlight

Miss Paul, blinded by the sunlight, only heard the bang. She claimed she was not late, not speeding and was fully alert.

She was also heard to say that her windscreen had misted up and she had been trying to demist it, Mr Lawson said.

Distraught: Toni Ponting, the pregnant mother he was helping to cross, said: 'my blood was boiling'

After the accident, Miss Paul told a police officer: 'I was driving along the road, the sun was low and my screen was starting to mist.

'I pulled my visor down and heard a bang. I never saw the guy from first to last.'

Mr Elsmore was taken by air ambulance to Southampton General Hospital where he died of chest and head injuries suffered in the accident.

Mr Lawson said: 'Sadly the injuries were incompatible with survival.'

Mother-of-two Toni Ponting, who Mr Elsmore was helping across the road, said the driver became hysterical when she realised what had happened.

Mrs Ponting, a part-time teacher, said: 'Ray was first to step in the road and there were no cars coming. We had a clear view and we spoke as we crossed.

'I could see cars coming behind him. Ray did not notice them because he was looking the other way.

'I saw the car approaching Ray and scoop him. It did not appear to slow down but stopped after it hit him.

'My blood was boiling, at the time being pregnant and hormonal, I was enraged and confused.

'The driver was upset and distraught. I said to the driver, "could you not see him?" and she said she could not.

'I told her she should not be driving. It was a cold, clear day and I had no difficulty seeing.'

The case continues.
