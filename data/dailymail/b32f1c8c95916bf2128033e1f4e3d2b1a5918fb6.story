Police in Rotterdam detained 42 suspects before and after the highly charged Europa League match between Feyenoord and Roma, while fans throwing objects onto the pitch forced a temporary halt to the second half.

Police said in a statement on Friday that they were 'satisfied with a busy day', spent preventing fights between rival fans amid fears of revenge attacks by Roma supporters for a riot in Rome a week earlier by Feyenoord hooligans.

Feyenoord officials were far from satisfied after fans pelted the pitch with objects such as cigarette lighters and threw an inflatable banana toward the field during the match which Roma won 2-1.

Coach Fred Rutten says 'Those sorts of things only hurt Feyenoord. It's a shame it happened.' 

Referee Clement Turpin was forced to to take both teams off the pitch amid concerns for the safety of the players in the 55th minute, following the controversial dismissal of Feyenoord's Mitchell Te Vrede for a challenge on Kostas Manola. 

The teams returned about 10 minutes later and almost immediately substitute Elvis Manu equalised for the Dutch side but Gervinho put Roma 2-1 in front three minutes later which was the final score, giving them a 3-2 win on aggregate.
