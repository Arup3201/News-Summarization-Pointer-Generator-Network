Barcelona manager Luis Enrique has asked the club to sign Atletico Madrid midfielder Koke to replace Xavi this summer, according to reports in the Spanish press on Saturday.

Long-serving midfielder Xavi is set to sign a three-year contract at Qatari side Al Sadd, following in the footsteps of another Spain great Raul. as he prepares to end his 24-year association with the Catalan club.

Spanish newspaper Sport claim that Enrique wants to sign Spain international Koke, who has a 60million euro (£44m) release clause in his contract, to help fill the void that will be left by Xavi.

Koke is a key part of the Atletico side and has won 16 international caps for Spain

Barcelona cannot register any new players until next January as part of their of the imposed transfer ban but can still sign players and Koke is top of Enrique's wishlist. 

Koke, 23, played a key role in Atletico's title-winning campaign last season and has made 16 appearances for the national side and set up the winning goal as Spain beat Ukraine 1-0 on Friday night.

The performance of Vicente del Bosque's side is another source of debate on the front pages in Spain after they laboured to victory in the Euro 2016 qualifier.

Alvaro Morata scored the goal's only game - his first for Spain - in the opening half before Ukraine gave the reigning European champions a fright in the second.

Madrid-based newspaper Marca slammed the national side as things 'went from bad to worse' insisting that Morata's strike 'saved a sad match'.

Meanwhile, AS went along a similar theme. 'Goal for Morata! (And a fright afterwards),' their headline read as they ran quotes from Del Bosque saying: 'The second half left a bad taste in my mouth.'

Marca also claim that Barcelona right back Dani Alves will sign a contract with PSG as he prepares to leave on a free transfer this summer and has started looking for a property in the French capital.

Italian papers Corriere dello Sport and La Gazzetta dello Sport lead with the injury farce surrounding Claudio Marchisio and the insuing row between Antonio Conte and former club Juventus

News of a row erupting between national head coach Antonio Conte and his former club Juventus over the injury to Claudio Marchisio dominates the front pages in Italy on Saturday.

Italy medics revealed the midfielder damaged his cruciate knee ligament while on international duty and was facing up to six-eight months out.

But after returning to Juve for further tests it emerged the injury was not as serious as first feared leading to questions over how Italy got it so wrong.

Juventus power-broker John Elkann was furious with former manager Conte asking: 'Why do they work so hard in the Nazionale?'

Conte responded by insisting Elkann never complained when he was in charge at the Turin-based club.
