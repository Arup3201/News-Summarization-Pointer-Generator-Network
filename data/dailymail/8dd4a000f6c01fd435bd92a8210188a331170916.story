BT was last night facing a growing backlash for paying almost £900 million to secure exclusive rights for Champions League football matches.

The telecoms giant had already said its ten million customers would see monthly package costs rise by up to 6.5 per cent from January 4.

But it is feared they may now suffer further price hikes to pay for the football deal.

Under fire: Telecoms giant BT has bid £897 million for three years' rights to Champions' League matches

One expert warned any rise in the cost of calls and line rental would hit pensioners hardest, as many rely on BT landlines.

The company is understood to have bid nearly twice as much as Sky for the rights to all Champions League and Europa League games for three years from 2015.

The firm is keen to expand its BT Vision service and overtake long-standing competitors like Sky

The £897 million bid comes after BT paid £738million for the broadcasting rights to 38 English Premier League games each season for the next three years.

The firm will hope to attract enough new subscribers and advertising revenue to recoup these huge outlays.

But many fear hidden charges to pay for the football coverage, and customers expressed concern online yesterday. One said: ‘When this all backfires for BT, and it will, those of us with BT phone lines will pay for it.

‘It’s time BT remembered their public service clause and treated customers with respect.’

Another forum user, John Dudman, said: ‘BT are using their total customer base to subsidise money being spent on sports licences. Pity my neighbours in Wales who are BT broadband customers and would love to watch sport but cannot because of insufficient bandwidth.’

Paul Green, of Saga, said: ‘Keeping in touch is absolutely vital for older people and for some the telephone is the only social interaction they get.

‘Anything that might increase the costs of this vital link needs to be scrutinised very carefully.’

In September it emerged that penalty fees for leaving a BT contract early will rise by as much as 30 per cent. Even the charge for dialling the Speaking Clock will go up by 6.3 per cent.

Standard line rental, paid on top of any phone or broadband package, will rise by 3.5 per cent to £15.99 a month. This is above the inflation rate of 2.7 per cent.

BT boasts its new sports service will be free for anyone already getting internet connection through the company.

It claims a million people have already signed up.

But all BT customers will end up financing the project through the price rises – even though the channels are free to some users of the firm’s arch rival, Virgin.

BT has splashed large sums on its ambitious scheme to rival Sky in offering top-flight sport.

As well eye-watering sums to host matches, the firm is thought to have spent tens of millions on a studio and pundits.

It has hired presenter Clare Balding, who will host her own show, and forked out for the opinions of the world’s most expensive footballer, Gareth Bale.

Last night a BT spokesman said: ‘Customers can be confident that they won’t find the cost of these rights added to their normal phone bill.’
