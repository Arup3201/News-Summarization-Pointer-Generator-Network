With his dark, floppy fringe and friendly eyes, this pig passes more than a passing resemblance to superstar comedian Michael McIntyre.

Didi has been causing hilarity among staff and visitors at Blackbrook Zoological Park, near Leek, Staffordshire, after the uncanny similarity was spotted.

The porker's dark, floppy fringe perfectly matches the comic's signature hairstyle.

It was recently revealed that McIntyre has cashed in a £9 million cheque from his latest stand-up comedy tour.

The comedian turned BBC1 chat show host pocketed the money for his 73-date Showtime tour, which included ten nights at London’s O2 Arena in 2012.

The tour grossed £21 million, putting him on a par with the Rolling Stones or Aerosmith.

Now it has been revealed that he last year paid himself and his wife Kitty the £9.23million that was left after covering costs and taxes when he wound up the company set up for the tour, Buddywaldo.

Showtime made McIntyre, 38, one of the highest-grossing comics in the world, and last year he paid £2.5 million for a six-bedroom house in the Wiltshire countryside.

It is a far cry from his plight a decade ago, when he was £40,000 in debt and struggling on the stand-up circuit.

The BBC paid McIntyre about £500,000 to present his six-part chat show.

But the
 show has had a mixed response from critics, with 400,000 viewers 
deserting it in the second week in which the guests were Abbey Clancy, 
Jeremy Clarkson and Sir David Jason.

Since
 the show is scheduled at 10.45pm – known to insiders as the ‘graveyard 
slot’ – he was only able to attract two million viewers, significantly 
down on the first week’s opening episode.

The
 figure is less than half that normally enjoyed by his BBC rival Graham 
Norton, whose Friday night show regularly attracts more than 4.5million,
 and is also down on ITV’s Jonathan Ross, who often reaches 3million 
viewers.

Many viewers have reacted enthusiastically to Mr McIntyre’s gentle observational comedy and self-deprecating manner.

The comic - who is being paid £500,000 for the six-part series - spent much of the show performing stand-up routines and interacting with the studio audience.

A punter placed a £1,000 bet on Rory McIlroy to win The 2014 Masters after finding what looked like McIlroy’s face burnt into the top of his Danish Pastry.

Rob Price, a college lecturer living in Andover, sent a tweet last night with a picture of his McIlroy Danish pastry followed by a tweet containing a screen grab of betting slip showing his £1,000 outlay on Rory McIlroy at 11/1.

Mr Price, 27, said: 'I couldn’t believe it when I picked up my Danish from the local bakery in Andover only to see what looked like Rory McIlroy’s face burnt into the top of it.'
