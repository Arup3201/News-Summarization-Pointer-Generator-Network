Shocking video footage has emerged of Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice dragging his seemingly unconscious fiancée Janay Palmer out of an elevator at an Atlantic City casino on Saturday.

The video would appear to contradict earlier claims by Rice's attorney that Saturday's incident was just a ‘very minor physical altercation.’

The couple were both arrested soon after on assault charges at the Revel Casino and police say they have separate unreleased footage which proves both parties attacked each other.

In the released footage, Rice can be seen trying to lift and move a seemingly unconscious Palmer out of a casino elevator.

With Palmer is sprawled on the ground, a security man in a suit - who appears to speak into a microphone at one stage - approaches and confronts Rice. 

Moments later Palmer seems to regain consciousness and Rice walks away from her.

The couple were taken to a nearby police station, charged and then released.

Rice's attorney Michael Diamondstein told TMZ Sports that the footage ‘is not the complete event, but is merely the end result of what transpired.’

Rice has been dating Palmer since 2008 and the pair have a daughter, 2-year-old Rayven

'We'll assure the public that when this matter is fully tried and completed, you'll have a better understanding of what happened and we ask the public to reserve making any judgment until all of the facts come out,' he said.

Rice, who doesn’t have a history of off-the-field issues, faces a possible suspension under the NFL’s personal conduct policy.

NFL commissioner Roger Goodell has the power to discipline players - whether they’ve been convicted or not - through suspensions, fines or can order them to seek therapy.

Rice has been dating Palmer since 2008 and the pair have a 
daughter, two-year-old Rayven.

He has been a stand-out player for 
the Ravens ever since he was drafted to the Maryland team from Rutgers 
University in the second round of the 2008 draft.

Rice helped bring the team a Super Bowl victory in 2013, and his daughter even 
came out on the field after the victory to help him celebrate.
