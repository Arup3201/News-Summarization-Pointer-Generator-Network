A Massachusetts mother has been jeered out of a movie theater because her autistic son was annoying patrons, one of whom called the young man 'retarded.'

Emily Colson, from Duxbury, described the traumatic experience in a blog post, explaining how she, her stepmother and her 23-year-old son Max were yelled at by fellow cinema-goers until they were forced to leave the film, and then crowd applauded their exit.

'It was the sound of an angry mob chasing us away with their jeers and taunts,' she wrote.

Shocking: Massachusetts mother Emily Colson was jeered out of a movie theater because her autistic son Max, pictured, was annoying patrons, one of whom called the young man 'retarded'

Colson said in the blog that their problems started when Max, who often gets frightened at the beginning of movies, shrieked 'I want to go home,' during the first preview and said it again once the film started.

'We hadn't even gotten past the previews. I know most of us, as families of children with disabilities, have all these plans in mind, but we couldn't even get there,' she later told the Patriot Ledger.

That's when the crowd turned on them.

'Are you going to make him be quiet?' one woman said, according to Colson's blog.

When she was informed that Max had autism, the woman hit back, 'I know he is, but why should the rest of us have to suffer?'

Her husband then allegedly chimed in with, 'If you don't make him be quiet I'm calling the manager.'

And things got worse from there, with 'ugly' remarks coming from all directions.

When
 the mother finally decided enough was enough and got up to leave, she 
claims the theater erupted into applause and patrons shouted 'don't come
 back' and 'he's retarded' as the family made their way to the door.

But before she left, she felt compelled to speak to the jeering group, she said in her blog.

'There
 is a lesson here. A lesson that is so much more important than anything
 you will learn from this movie,' she said she told them.

Now
 a woman Colson goes to church with, Renee Watson, is hiring out an 
entire movie theater for children with special needs after being so 
moved by the mother's painful experience.

Ugly behavior: Colson claims the theater erupted into applause and patrons shouted 'don't come back' and 'he's retarded' as she, her stepmother and Max, pictured left and right, made their way to the door

Watson, a mother-of-three, was so touched by the story that she organized 'Movie With Max' on March 27 at a local Regal Cinema and nearly 300 special needs kids will watch 'Muppets Most Wanted' together without fearing they'll be bullied to leave.

The popular event was expanded from a 94-seat cinema to one three times the size and has now sold out.

'I just thought that if it were my child, I would have to find a way to make this right for him,' Watson said.

And this time Colson knows she can enjoy the movie with her son.

'There are so many families (with special needs) that are very isolated,' Colson said to the Ledger.

'(This) has generated a huge amount of conversation about our families in the community, and I'm so thankful for that.'
