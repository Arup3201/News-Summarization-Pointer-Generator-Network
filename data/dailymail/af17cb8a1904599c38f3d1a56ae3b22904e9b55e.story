Liverpool striker Luis Suarez would find it 'very difficult to say no' to Real Madrid if they made a move for him this summer, according to his lawyer.

The 27-year-old Uruguayan tried to force through a transfer to Arsenal last summer before enjoying a prolific season with Liverpool, winning the Premier League's golden boot and the European golden shoe after scoring 31 goals.

Suarez was also voted the PFA Player's Player of the Season and the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year for 2013-14.

Liverpool came agonisingly close to winning the title last season, eventually finishing second to Manchester City, and Suarez claimed earlier this month that he wanted to stay at Anfield.

But his lawyer, Alejandro Balbi, has revealed that the striker would find it hard to resist a move to Spain's capital to join up with Carlo Ancelotti's side, who won a record 10th Champions League last season.

Balbi told Cadena SER: 'A year ago he was very likely to leave Liverpool (for Arsenal).

'Now I think it is very difficult because he is an idol, although clubs can offer a lot of money.

'If there is such a big offer from Real Madrid, it would be very difficult to say no. Luis Suarez has always had a predisposition for Spain.'
