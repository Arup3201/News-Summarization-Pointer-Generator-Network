An Illinois woman who died of an antibiotic-resistant infection contracted shortly after cutting her leg on a shelf at a Kmart is suing the retail giant. 

According to the suit filed by Dolores Thompson's son, David Thompson, she was on one of the store's motorized scooters on Nov. 15, 2012, when she 'lacerated her right leg on a metal shelving unit when attempting to evade boxes.'

David Thompson is also the administrator of her estate.

Dolores Thompson developed a fatal infection after she 'lacerated her right leg on a metal shelving unit when attempting to evade boxes' at Kmart

NBC Chicago reports the accident took place at a Kmart on 11 Northpoint Dr., south of Joliet, which has since been shuttered.

One month later she was diagnosed with an methicillin resistant staph aureus infection in her leg.  

In April, she died of related sepsis in Cook County. 

According to her obituary, the 88-year-old Thompson left behind one grandson, and was a homemaker for most of her life. 

A representative for the company said it has yet to see the suit and cannot comment on it

Thompson is seeking $200,000 in damaged plus court costs with the four-count wrongful death suit. 

A representative for the company said it has yet to see the suit and cannot comment on it.

Kmart is owned by Sears Holdings Corp.
