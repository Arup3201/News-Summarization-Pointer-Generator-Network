A three-year-old girl watched in horror as her pet dog had its leg ripped off by a bull mastiff.

Nyiahh Agordo screamed as she saw her beloved pet Teddy, a ten-year-old Yorkshire terrier, trapped in the jaws of the other dog who ‘threw him around like a toy’.

Nyiahh was shopping with her sister Paris, nine, and their mother Hannah Grundy in Kirkham, Lancashire, when the attack happened. Miss Grundy, 25, had gone into a shop with Nyiahh, leaving Paris outside with Teddy.

But on hearing screams, they ran outside to see their pet being savaged by the bull mastiff.

Lorraine White, Miss Grundy’s mother,
 who shares ownership of Teddy, said: ‘It savaged our little dog to the 
point his leg was ripped off.

'It was shaking Teddy while he was in its 
mouth – it was like he was a bone ... he was going to die if the dog 
didn’t let go. In the end, two men were wrestling with the dog and it 
finally let go.

‘Nyiahh saw it all happen. She’s been really upset by the whole thing. It was throwing him around like he was a toy.’

Vets in Blackpool treated Teddy for severe back injuries and had to amputate what was left of his front right leg.

Mrs White, who works as a cleaner, said her pet is still so weak he needs to be bottle fed.

‘We’ve been sat up nursing him. The poor little thing is coping as best he can and has just learned to hop around.

‘He kept falling over at first but he’s getting better. It has been heartbreaking to watch.

‘The other dog’s owner was nowhere to be seen. I think it’s disgusting that people can just let their dogs run wild.’

Dog wardens are investigating the attack, which happened on May 14. A police spokesman  said the bull mastiff may have escaped from its owner’s garden.
