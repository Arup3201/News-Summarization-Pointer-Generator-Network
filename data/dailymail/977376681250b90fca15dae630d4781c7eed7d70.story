Silverstone has come to the aid of Circuit of Wales and will stage the British round of MotoGP for the next two years.

The Northamptonshire venue ran the event from 2010 to 2014 until CoW negotiated a deal with rights holders Dorna to stage the race for five years from this season.

That was despite the fact construction work had yet to commence on the troubled facility at Ebbw Vale.

The British Grand Prix in the MotoGP championship was left in turmoil after Donington Park pulled out of hosting the 2015 race. Above is the start of the 2014 Grand Prix which took place at Silverstone

With ongoing difficulties regarding planning, CoW bosses turned to Donington Park initially to host the 2015 GP, much to Silverstone's dismay.

But on Tuesday, Donington Park chiefs withdrew from the opportunity to play host after neither party could agree terms to form a legal contract.

Donington, which last hosted MotoGP in 2009, claimed difficulties arose with CoW regarding funding arrangements to help them stage the event.

In a catch-22 situation, CoW countered by stating it was unwilling to provide the funding without a signed contractual agreement in place.

CoW has now turned to Silverstone, whose new management team led by Patrick Allen has welcomed the approach.

To accommodate the August 28-30 race, Silverstone has been forced to switch the World Series by Renault event scheduled for those dates to September 5-6.

Donington Park had previously held the British Grand Prix from 1987 through to 2009, with Australia's Casey Stoner (above) winning on a Ducati in 2008

Silverstone managing director Allen said: 'A lot of work has been done over recent years to ensure MotoGP fans enjoy what Silverstone has to offer, and it was devastating for the venue to lose the event last autumn.

'I welcomed the opportunity to meet with both Dorna and the Circuit of Wales recently so we could try and find a way to keep MotoGP in the UK and racing at Silverstone.

'Two-wheel racing is as much a part of Silverstone's heritage as four-wheel racing and I am obviously delighted to be in a position to announce we are hosting both the F1 and MotoGP Grands Prix in 2015.

'We have recently introduced a family-friendly pricing policy for the Formula One British Grand Prix which is proving extremely popular.

'Over the next two weeks I will be working closely with my team at Silverstone to launch a ticket model for MotoGP I hope will be equally well received by fans.'

Regarding the two-year deal, CoW chief executive Michael Carrick has expressed his gratitude to Silverstone for stepping into the breach.

'We want to thank the new management at Silverstone, our partners at Dorna and our investors for the rapid response needed to support the 2015 event when it became clear we would be unlikely to conclude the contractual arrangements at Donington,' said Carrick.

'We are delighted to secure the future of the event for the next two years while our circuit in Wales is under construction.'

CoW first faces a detailed public inquiry before construction can be allowed to begin, with Carrick confident it will be the final hurdle.

Carrick added: 'We continue to advance our development activity on the Circuit of Wales and are focused on the upcoming public inquiry into the deregistration of the common land.

'We expect construction to commence once this inquiry has concluded.'
