Charged: Ian Watkins, 35, pictured with former girlfriend Fearne Cotton, has been remanded in custody and is accused of six child sex offences

The singer of top British rock band Lostprophets was today remanded in custody for another ten weeks after being accused of plotting to rape a child.

Frontman Ian Watkins, 35, who was a former boyfriend of DJ Fearne Cotton, is charged with six child sex offences.

The most serious is conspiring with a woman fan, 24, to rape a girl under the age of 13.

The singer and two women are also accused of conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with a boy under 13.

Watkins, of Pontypridd, South Wales, 
was further charged with three separate charges of possession, making 
and distribution of indecent images of children.

He is also accused of possession of 'extreme pornography' - some involving animals.

All three appeared via video link at Cardiff Crown Court this morning and only spoke to confirm their names at the preliminary hearing, a formality in the legal process, which lasted less than 10 minutes.

The rock star dated presenter Fearne Cotton for
less than a year in 2005, although the pair are thought to have 
remained friends and were pictured together in 2008.

Watkins, dressed in a black suit, 
black shirt and tie, spoke only to confirm his name today.

Among those looking on from the public gallery was the rockerâ€™s mother Elaine.

Watkins spent Christmas in Parc Prison in Bridgend, South Wales, after being remanded on December 19.

An application to a judge in Cardiff Crown Court for bail was adjourned for another hearing to take his plea on the charges on March 11.

The two women - one aged 20 from Doncaster 
and the other 24 from Bedford - were also remanded in custody on similar
conspiracy charges involving children.

An earlier court heard 40 images of children and child abuse were being investigated in the policeBandmates spoke of their shock after he was charged.

A statement said: 'We find ourselves in a state of shock.

'We are learning about the details of the investigation along with you.

'It is a difficult time for us and our families, and we want to thank our fans for their support as we seek answers.'

He dated TV presenter Cotton for almost a year in 2005 and in 2007 he was romantically linked to model Alexa Chung.

Tattooed Watkins formed Lostprophets in 1997 with friends from the small former mining town of Pontypridd.

They started playing gigs around South Wales and were eventually signed, releasing breakthrough single Shinobi vs Dragon Ninja in 2001.

The band were at the forefront of the popular 'Nu Metal' sound and attracted thousands of teenage fans.

Debut album The Fake Sound of Progress achieved Platinum status selling more than 300,000 copies.

The band began to make high profile appearances at UK music festivals and on TV shows and before long they were selling out large arenas.

In 2004 they released second album Start Something which went Gold in America - with more than 500,000 copies bought.

The band embarked on a world tour before recording Liberation Transmission which was released in 2006.

Lead single Rooftops got to eight in the UK charts - their joint best performance with Last Train Home.
