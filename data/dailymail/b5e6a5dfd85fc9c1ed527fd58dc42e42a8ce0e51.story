Radamel Falcao should have joined Chelsea, Liverpool or Real Madrid last summer as Manchester United didn't need to sign him, according to Monaco boss Leonardo Jardim.

The Colombian striker has struggled for form since moving to Old Trafford on a season-long loan and it appears increasingly unlikely that United will spend £43million to sign him permanently this summer.

Jardim admits that he expected Falcao to leave the Ligue 1 side last August, although he was surprised at his destination.

Speaking to The Sun, Jardim said: 'In the last days of August I was thinking Falcao would leave - but I thought he'd go to another club.

'In England other teams wanted him. But I didn't think United would be the ones taking him as they had Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney.'

'Maybe they did not need him. It's my opinion but not my decision to make.'

Liverpool were keen on Falcao last summer, while Real Madrid have a long-term interest in the former Porto forward.

United have the option to sign Falcao permanently this summer but they appear unlikely to do so

And Jardim, who is preparing his side to face Arsenal in the last 16 of the Champions League, believes a move elsewhere may have benefited the 29-year-old. 

'I think other clubs needed him more, such as Chelsea, Manchester City or Liverpool,' he said.

'I think at that moment it would have been easier to go to Chelsea, Liverpool or even Real Madrid.'
