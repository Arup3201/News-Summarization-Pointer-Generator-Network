A man was arrested this morning for the Tulsa Good Friday shooting rampage after he randomly gunned down five black victims on the second anniversary of his father's death at the hands of an African American, according to police.

Jake England, 19, and his friend and alleged accomplice Alvin Watts, 32, both white, face murder charges over the shootings in Tulsa, Oklahoma that killed three and left two wounded.

On Thursday, two years after Carl England was killed, Jake England took to Facebook to rage about the 'f****** n*****' who shot his father to death.

Later that night, England and Watts drove through black neighborhoods in northern Tulsa in a white pickup truck and gunned down five strangers near the spot where England's father died, according to police.

The attacks terrorized the black community and African-American leaders in Tulsa called the crimes racially-motivated.

Racist tirade: The day before the Good Friday shootings, Jake England against the 'f****** n*****' who shot and killed his father Carl England

Thursday afternoon, England wrote on his Facebook wall: 'Today is two years that my dad has been gone shot by a f****** n****** it's hard not to go off.'

He also mentioned Sheran Wilde, 24, his girlfriend and the mother of his young son, who died in January.

'between that and sheran I'm gone in the head. RIP. Dad and sheran I. Love and miss u. I think about both of u every second of the day,' he wrote on his public Facebook profile.

The Facebook page had been taken down by Sunday afternoon.

Acting on an anonymous tip and backed
 by a helicopter, police arrested Jake England and Alvin Watts at about 2am Sunday at a home in Turley, just north of Tulsa. The two men 
were roommates, and officers went to their home, then followed them 
several blocks to another home, where they were arrested without 
incident, police said.

Authorities said they planned to 
charge them with murder and other offenses. Task force commander Maj. 
Walter Evans said that investigators recovered a weapon but that it was 
not clear who fired the shots. They also found a truck that had been 
burned.

Gunned down: Carl England was killed by an ex-convict after a fight at his daughter's apartment complex April 5, 2010

A family friend, Susan Sevenstar, 
said that England was 'a good kid' and 'a good, hard worker,' who 'was 
not in his right mind"'after losing his father and the January suicide 
of his fiancee, with whom he'd recently had a baby.

'If anybody is trying to say this is a
 racial situation, they've got things confused,' said SMs evenstar, who 
described England as Cherokee Indian. 'He didn't care what your color 
was. It wasn't a racist thing.'

The Tulsa World reported that 
England's father, Carl, was shot in the chest during a scuffle with a 
man who had tried to break into his daughter's apartment.

Convict: Pernell Jefferson, 40, is serving six years in prison for crimes related to the killing of Jake England's father, Carl

On April 5, 2010, Carl England, 47, 
showed up at the apartment complex where his daughter lived with her 
boyfriend. The boyfriend had gotten into a fight Pernell Jefferson, 40, 
and had hit him with a baseball bat, the Tulsa World reported at the 
time.

Jefferson, who had been in prison on 
drug and weapons charges, then tried to break into the couple's 
apartment but left, saying he planned to 'settle the dispute.'

England
 and his daughter's boyfriend went looking for Jefferson at the 
apartment complex. When the found him, England hit him with a stick and 
knocked him to the ground.

Jefferson pulled out a gun and shot England in the chest, the World reported, killing him.

Jefferson, who is black, was arrested the next day when he showed up at a hospital. He was convicted of pointing a firearm. He is serving a six year prison sentence in the shooting.

Carl England was killed at 3608 N. Quaker Ave. in northern Tulsa. All of the Good Friday shootings occurred within four miles of the apartment complex where he died. Most were much closer.

The shootings come at a fraught moment for black Americans. In late 
February, an unarmed black teen, Trayvon Martin, was fatally shot by a 
neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla., raising questions about 
racial profiling and touching off protests across the nation.

Black community leaders held a meeting on Friday night to calm unrest and promote safety.

NAACP Tulsa president, the Rev. Warren
 Blakney Sr., told the World that the shooter appeared to be 'targeting 
black people to shoot.'

'I'm on edge for my people,' Blakney said as he argued that the crime was clearly racially motivated.

Close proximity: The five shooting victims were found at four locations within four miles of the apartment complex where Jake England's father was killed two years ago

Troubled: Jake England (left) made posts on his Facebook page that showed he struggled with the deaths of his father and of the mother of his young son. His friend, Watts, is also his accomplice, according to police

'When there are reports that someone systematically shot black folk, what is one left to believe?' he told reporters.

On Saturday, police chief Chuck Jordan 
described the shootings as 'vicious and cowardly' as he warned the 
gunmen: 'We're coming for you.'

Police have confirmed whether the 
shootings were racially-motivated. However, a special task force and the
 FBI have begun investigating the crimes.

England's
 Facebook wall posts show a troubled, angry young man struggling to 
raise his young son and cope with the loss of his father and his 
girlfriend.

After the 
shootings, he wrote: 'People talking s*** on me for some s*** I didn't 
do... I do believer (sic) it just mite be the time to call it quits... 
if something does happen tonite be ready for another funeral later.'

Four shooting victims were found in yards and the fifth in a street. Police identified those killed as Dannaer Fields, 49, Bobby Clark, 54, and William Allen, 31. Police Chief Chuck Jordan said the gunmen appeared to have chosen their victims at random.

Fields was found wounded about 1am Friday, Clarke was found in a street about an hour later, and Allen was discovered in the yard of a funeral home about 8.30am.

Minutes after Fields was found, police found two men with gunshot wounds in another yard two blocks away. They were taken to hospitals in critical condition but expected to survive, police said. Their names have not been released.

Crime scene: William Allen, 31, was found in the yard of this funeral home many hours after he was gunned down. His wife says he was walking home from his brother's house

Police are waiting for the results of forensic 
tests to determine scientific links between the shootings.

Police Capt. Steve Odom said in his 
30 years with the police department, he'd never seen so many shootings 
happen in such a short time.

Walker said detectives interviewed people Friday afternoon in the neighborhoods where the shootings happened and believe a white man driving a white pickup truck may have been involved.

At least one victim said a shooter stopped his target to ask for directions before opening fire.

Allen, who was walking home from his brother's house, had narrowly avoided death once, when he was badly injured in a car crash. His family never expected his life to end violently.

'Why? Why did this happen? What was the reason? What was the motive?" his wife Jeanette, asked the World.

'He was sweet, caring... my lover. He always tried to make people laugh.'

Tulsa City Councilor Jack Henderson urged people to be cautious but not let 'some crazy, deranged person mess up their weekend.'

'There's no need to become a vigilante,' Henderson said, adding that he has been assured police are working on the case as a '24/7 round-the-clock deal.'
