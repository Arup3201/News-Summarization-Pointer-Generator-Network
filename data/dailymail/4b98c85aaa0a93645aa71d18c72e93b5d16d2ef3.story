A Fort Carson soldier has been charged with murder in the shooting death of a 19-year-old comrade while they were deployed to Jordan in May, the Army said Tuesday.

Spc. Jeffery T. Page, 23, of Perrysburg, Ohio, has been accused of killing Spc. Adrian M. Perkins of Pine Valley, California, with an M4 rifle on May 15 at Muwaffaq Salti Air Base, charging documents said.

A hearing is scheduled at the Colorado post Wednesday to determine whether there's enough evidence for a court-martial.

Page and his attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment made through Fort Carson officials.

Both soldiers were infantrymen in the 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team at Fort Carson, outside Colorado Springs.

Perkins joined the Army in August 2012. He had been assigned to Fort Carson since January 2013 and was on his first deployment.

Page has been in the Army for 2½ years. No other information was released about his service record.

If convicted of murder, Page could face life in prison without parole and a dishonorable discharge. He is also charged with manslaughter, negligent homicide and failure to obey an order or regulation.

Page is the second Fort Carson soldier facing charges of killing another soldier.

A court martial began Thursday for Sgt. Montrell Lamar Anderson Mayo in the death of his girlfriend during a Valentine's Day quarrel in 2013.

He is charged with murder and assault in the death of Cpl. Kimberly Walker, 28.
