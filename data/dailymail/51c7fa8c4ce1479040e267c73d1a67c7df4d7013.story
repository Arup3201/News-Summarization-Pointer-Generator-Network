A middle school principal from Fort Worth, Texas, has been found guilty of wire-tapping after she got her daughter to plant a camera in the locker room of another high school.

Wendee Long, 47, had her daughter, who was 17 at the time, hide a recording cell phone to catch the basketball coach from Argyle High School yelling at the team.

Long's daughter had previously played on the basketball team and the teenager and her teammates were recorded in the locker room during an away game at Sanger High School, WFAA.com reported.

The daughter was accused of planting the recording device, but her mother was charged for orchestrating the incident in February 2012.

A mother of one of the teenagers recorded, Julie Sheridan, said: 'The whole thing was just shocking is so many ways.'

It was Sheridan and other parents who filed the original police complaints.

Long was found not guilty of improper photography but guilty of wire-tapping and will be sentenced on October 10.

Wendee Long allegedly planted the device after her two daughters had complained the coach shouted too much.

Her teenage daughter Caydan, who did not face any charges, placed a camera phone inside a locker and pressed record.

It did not capture coach Skip Townsend, 61, saying or doing anything inappropriate during the half-time meeting, authorities told WFAA-TV.

Someone anonymously sent the video to the superintendent and several board members and Long turned herself in to authorities.

'The intent is to invade someone's privacy,' Denton County Assistant District Attorney Jamie Beck said last year.

Long had been the principal at Wayside Middle School for five years in the Eagle Mountain-Saginaw district.

She was placed on paid administrative leave when the incident came to light and the school district conducted its own investigation.

She was also previously a member of the school board in the Argyle district.

Long's attorney, Daniel Peugh, said he was surprised by the charges and said no laws were broken.

'She has not violated any law,' Peugh told WFAA. 'We do not believe anything has taken place that should involve the justice system.'

Julie Sheridan, whose daughter was in the locker room at the time, said: 'I donâ€™t understand why someone would go to those lengths to break a law to try to get something to go the way they want it to go.'

Long's daughters quit the basketball team after the incident.
