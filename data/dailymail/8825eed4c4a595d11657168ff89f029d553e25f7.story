After her recent bout of illness, all eyes were on the Queen as she attended a church service yesterday.

At least, they were until the Countess of Wessex turned up.

Sophie’s skin-tight outfit – with an exposed zip stretching from the hem to her waist – will inevitably draw comparisons to the derriere-hugging dress worn by Pippa Middleton at her sister’s wedding to Prince William.

Sophie, Countess of Wessex came up top in the fashion stakes for Easter service at Windsor castle today

The Countess teamed her racy 
royal-blue number with an equally extravagant peacock-feather hat 
designed by Jane Taylor Millinery, thought to be worth around £860.

Her mother-in-law appeared back to her best, weeks after being admitted to hospital for the first time in a decade.

The Queen, who turns 87 this month, 
was greeted by a crowd of well-wishers as she arrived for the 
traditional Easter Sunday service at Windsor Castle with other members 
of the royal family.

Princess Eugenie and her sister 
Beatrice wore dresses cut above the knee despite the chilly weather. 
Both arrived in stilettos, with sparkling clutch bags.

The Countess of Wessex was accompanied
 to St George’s Chapel by her two children Lady Louise Windsor, nine, 
and James Viscount Severn, five.

Although her sartorial choices are 
often overlooked due to the popularity of younger family members, 
Sophie, 48, has demonstrated in recent years that she remains a fashion 
force to be reckoned with.

The night before Pippa wowed the world
 with her bridesmaid’s dress at the royal wedding of 2011, the Countess 
turned heads at a royal reception with a plunging scarlet gown from 
Bruce Oldfield.

Her choice for the wedding itself – a 
chic peach-coloured dress and matching jacket, with a statement Jane 
Taylor hat – prompted readers of Hello! magazine to crown her the most 
elegant guest.

It was announced last month that the Countess will become
 the first ever patron of the London College of Fashion.

She will hold the position for three 
years, working on its Better Lives campaign which aims to use fashion to
 promote change and sustainability.

Such accolades demonstrated how far the Countess has come since her own wedding in 1999.

The Countess was roundly criticised 
for her ill-fitting  ivory silk coat dress, inlaid with 325,000 beads 
and an enormous veil that obscured much of the gown.
