One of the world's greatest sporting spectacles returns to the capital this weekend as elite to fun runners take part in the London Marathon.

Double Olympic champion Mo Farah, who
will run half of the race in preparation for doing the full 26.2 mile 
distance next year, said he hopes lots of people will come and enjoy the
marathon atmosphere.

So where is the best place to go to catch the action? And where should you go to wind down afterwards... Read our guide to finding your London Marathon hot spot...

The marathon starts at Greenwich Park, Blackheath.

The elite women, including Brits Amy
Whitehead and Susan Partridge - who are aiming for World Championship 
selection - start at 9am, followed by the wheelchair athletes at 9.20am,
where British paralympic hero David Weir is aiming for his seventh 
victory.

The elite men and the masses will then start at 10am.Â 

Greenwich park is a great place to soak up the anticipation and atmosphere but certain areas will be restricted to the runners.

BEST FOR STAR SPOTTERS

Star spotters hoping to see the 
celebrities taking part this year - including Katherine Jenkins, Amy 
Childs and Andrew Strauss - should head to the 'green' start where the 
celebs will begin. Their first mile is on a separate route along St 
John's Park road which then links up with the 'blue' start for elite and
club runners on Shooters Hill Road.

TO WATCH THE MASSES

Meanwhile the 'red' start for the 
masses begins along Charlton Way before linking up with the other 
runners at the three mile point.

TO SPOT MO FARAH

Fans of Farah should head south of the river for the best place to spot him as he takes part in the first half of the race.

CUTTY SARK LANDMARK

The Cutty Sark, just after the six mile point, is a popular vantage point and the London Marathon website advises 'there will be good spectator viewing points in Cutty Sark Gardens 
although access will be restricted on the east side. Please follow the 
directions of the event marshals.'

The
advantage of this spot is that if you are tracking a certain runner, 
once you have cheered them through, you can then take the The Greenwich 
Foot Tunnel to the Isle of Dogs, where you will then see the runners 
again as the approach the 17 mile point.

Atmosphere: The Cutty Sark is a great place for spectating

The
London Marathon website confirms that the tunnel 'will be open and the 
Tunnel will have a one way (south to north) flow for two hours between 
10:30 am and 12:30 pm to allow Marathon spectators to cross to the north
side of the route. A queuing system will operate at the Tunnel entrance
on the Greenwich side.'

BEAT THE CROWDS NEAR CUTTY SARK

Anyone
trying to beat the crowds at Cutty Sark should head further along the 
course where the route circles Canada Water. The streets between the 9 -
11 miles are often less congested providing a better view of the 
runners.

Spectating can be thirsty work, here's where you can watch the runners while enjoying some food and drink...

AT SIX MILES: The Mitre Hotel, a stone's throw from the Cutty Sark on Greenwich High Road, will have a barbeque from 11am and beer tasting

AT 12 MILES: Runners will pass The Kings Arms on Tooley Street just before crossing Tower Bridge. The pub will hold a champagne breakfast from 9am and have live music throughout the day

AT 17 MILES: As athletes make their way round the Isle of Dogs, The Lord Nelson pub on Manchester Road, will have a party atmosphere where spectators can cheer the runners on while enjoying a burger

AT THE FINISH: One of the closest pubs to the finish for weary runners to have a pint and toast their achievement is the Red Lion on Parliament Street

The iconic landmark of Tower Bridge is a welcome sight for runners as it means they are nearly at the halfway mark. Arrive early to grab a space to watch the action here as it is often one of the most popular spots on the course.

As the route heads out to Canary Wharf and then turns back on itself, people in pole position near the Tower of London will be able to watch athletes coming over Tower Bridge and then see them again as they pass on East Smithfield at the 22 mile mark and then on to Lower Thames Street.

TWO BITES OF THE CHERRY

Spectators positioned along the Highway between miles 13 and 14 will also see the runners running out and then back again.

TO SPOT MO FARAH FINISH HIS HALF MARATHON

Position yourself at the 13.1 mile mark if you want to see Farah finishing his half.

FOR ENTERTAINMENT

Canary Wharf is another of the best places to soak up the atmosphere as bands line the route by the landmark.

As the runners enter the Isle of Dogs at mile 15 and then snake their way round the base of Canary Wharf, there are multiple options to cheer your friend or family member at more than one spot without having to travel far yourself.

AVOID THE CROWDS

For those who want a spot with less 
crowds, take the Docklands to Blackwall or Limehouse stations as the 
runners pass at 20 to 21 miles. Extra loud cheers will be needed here to
raise the spirits of the runners as they dig deep for the last third of
the race.

Victory in sight: David Weir hopes to win the wheelchair race again

Following the horrific events at the 
Boston Marathon earlier this week, where bombs were detonated at the 
finishing line, athletes and organisers hope the atrocity won't put 
spectators off attending Sunday's event.

Chief superintendent Julia Pendry from Scotland Yard confirmed the number of officers on the streets will be increased by 40 per cent 'for reassurance' and so 'people who come to London on Sunday feel safe when they are in the city'.

The police are urging spectators to be extra vigilant and not to leave their bags unattended.

Mo Farah said he has no worries about taking part despite Monday's events. 'This 
is home for me. This is where I grew up and there's no reason not to do 
this,' he said.

Stand out in the crowd: A number will take part in fancy dress to raise money for charity

Safety concerns: An extra police presence has been promised to 'reassure' people after Monday's events in Boston

The last three miles of the race passes along the Embankment, turning right at Big Ben into Birdcage Walk and then past Buckingham Palace into The Mall to finish.

Arrive early to get a good spot on these stretches as the crowds can often become three deep. Blackfriars and Waterloo Bridges are places to get an elevated view of the action.

The grand stand seating on The Mall is restricted to those with tickets - usually given to those supporting charity runners and places are allocated in advance.

Those who can't make it into London or want to watch from the comfort of their sofa can follow the BBC's five-and-a-half hour coverage starting at 8.30am. They will also have live streaming on their website.

The London Marathon website will also have live updates on the day and on their Twitter feed. You can also track individual runners via the website on Sunday.
