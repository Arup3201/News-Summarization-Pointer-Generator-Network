A great-grandmother with dementia was taken to a stranger's house, tucked up in his bed and left for seven hours by bungling hospital staff.

Lilian Taylor, 88, was driven by mistake to her previous home in just her nightdress after being discharged from Homerton Hospital in Hackney, east London.

The door was answered by a shocked old man who had recently moved in. Mrs Taylor, of nearby Clapton, was then taken upstairs and put into his bed before she was left.

Outraged: Fred Taylor (left) said his mother Lilian (right) was driven to the wrong home after being discharged from hospital. Lilian, 88, suffers from dementia and was only found after a panic-stricken Fred raised the alarm

The widow, who has Alzheimer's, was only found and rescued after her panic-stricken son, Fred Taylor, rang the hospital to find out where she had got to.

Hospital staff alerted police and officers dashed round to pick up Mrs Taylor at the house in Hackney almost seven hours after she had been released.

The police took her back to her sheltered care home, where she's lived since May.

Mr Taylor, 65, of Basildon, Essex, said: 'I still can't believe this happened to my poor old mother. It was a bizarre and terrifying episode - an absolute nightmare.'

The father-of-two and grandfather-of-two added: 'I'm just so relieved that my mother came out of her terrible ordeal unscathed.'

Panic-stricken: Mr Taylor says his mother was discharged from hospital in a flimsy nightdress. He said he was 'worried sick' when he couldn't find her

Mr Taylor said his mother was released by the hospital at about 12.30pm on September 25 - but hours later she still hadn't turned up at her home.

'I was worried sick and my mind was racing wondering where she'd got to.

'So I asked her ex-neighbour to check out her old home,' said Mr Taylor, a retired photographer and tailor.

'She went round and found her lying in this absent-minded elderly man's bed wearing just the light nightdress she'd been released in.

'I immediately called the hospital to tell them what had happened and they brought in the police.'

Mr Taylor said it was outrageous that his mum, who used to work for HM Customs & Excise in Holborn, north London, had been treated so badly.

'My mum's a typical born-and-bred East End girl - the salt of the earth.

'She grew up through the Blitz surviving German bombs in the Second World War, has worked incredibly hard all her life and been a first-class citizen,' he said.

'My dad Fred fought with the famous Desert Rats in North Africa.

'He died when he was 91 and I don't know what he'd make of this nonsense. If I had been on holiday, my mother, who has Alzheimer's, may well not be here today.

'She could have been anywhere on the planet and would not have been aware. She's so reliant on other people, even for doing her shoes up.'

Investigation: Homerton Hospital has said it is in contact with Mrs Taylor's family. A spokesman said patient's safety is taken seriously

Mr Taylor said he was also furious his frail mother, who also has a son, Dave, 64, five grandchildren and six great-grandchildren, had been sent 'home' in her nightclothes.

'I cannot believe they dropped her off in just her nightdress,' he said. Her neighbour had to lend her a dressing gown to return home with.

'It's just not good enough. I want a full investigation to be held into this incident to establish exactly what happened and to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else.'

London and south east-based housing association, Family Mosaic, manages Mrs Taylor's current care home.

A spokesman said the ambulance crew who took the OAP to hospital after she was found collapsed by her bed on September 24 were given a referral note with up-to-date details of her new address in Clapton.

A Homerton Hospital spokesman said they were carrying out an urgent probe into the blunder.

A hospital spokesman said: 'We take the safety of our patients very seriously and have immediately launched an investigation into how this incident occurred.

'We are in contact with Mrs Taylor's family and once the investigation is completed we shall be providing them with further details of why Mrs Taylor was taken to her former address.'
