One of America’s priciest divorce cases is coming to an end now baseball power couple Frank and Jamie McCourt are said to have come to a deal.

Former LA Dodgers CEO Jamie will reportedly abandon claims for a share of the team from the owner - her husband Frank - and get $130million.

It means Jamie will no longer prevent Frank’s plan to remain owner by selling the troubled baseball team’s television rights in a bankruptcy court.

A divorce filing valued the marriage at $1.2billion, including six homes and the $800million LA Dodgers.

The couple lived a lavish lifestyle, paying a $225,000 monthly lease for a private jet and $10,000 a month for Jamie's hair stylist.

They also spent tens of thousands of dollars on designer clothing and Frank once shelled out $80,000 on a Caribbean vacation.

A settlement would end the two-year case
of what is believed to be California’s costliest divorce ever, 
reported the Los Angeles Times.

It will also clear the way for Frank 
to take on Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig in court as he 
tries to keep hold of the Dodgers.

The couple spent more than $20million 
over the divorce in July - and the battle over who owned the Dodgers 
could have added another $14million.

The couple announced in October 2009 that they would be ending their 30-year marriage - and Frank fired Jamie as CEO.

The McCourts continued their brawl 
over the team’s ownership and then the MLB took control of the club's 
day-to-day operations in mid-April.

The Dodgers filed for bankruptcy in June and lawyers for Jamie alleged that Frank was running the team into the ground.

But Frank’s counsel claimed it was Jamie who was refusing to accept any settlements and was allowing the case to drag on.

The Dodgers blamed a cash-flow crisis
on the MLB's refusal to pass the television deal that Frank was 
counting on to keep the team afloat.

A judge ruled last December that a post-nuptial marital agreement that gave Frank sole ownership of the Dodgers was invalid.

That allowed Jamie to seek half the team under California's community property law.

The McCourts had reached a settlement that was contingent on MLB's approval of the TV deal with Fox, worth up to $3billion.

But Commissioner Selig rejected the 
deal at the time, saying it was not in the best interests of baseball. 
The battle will soon continue in court.
