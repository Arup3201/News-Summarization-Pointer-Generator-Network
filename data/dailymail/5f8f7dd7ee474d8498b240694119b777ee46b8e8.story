A Facebook page showing videos of bare-knuckle brawls across the Northern Territory has amassed an unlikely following.

The NT Fights page displays around 20 videos of spats and is actively calling for more people to submit footage to the page.

Over 8,000 people now ‘like’ the page, which shows street fights in remote communities across the Northern Territory including Daily River, Elcho Island, Numbulwar, Wadeye and the Territory’s capital Darwin.

The man who created the page – and who wishes to remain anonymous – wrote in a video call out: ‘N.T Fights some pretty awesome s**t . Send in all of your fights from the N.T.’

A Facebook page showing a collection of videos of people fighting in the street has gained thousands of fans on the social media site

The violent videos are sent in to the Facebook page by witnesses to the brawls

They told the NT News they were baffled with the page’s popularity: ‘I seriously didn’t think people would get into this page so much, I think people just like watching people fight.’

However, not every finds the page amusing.

One woman commented: ‘This page should be taken down!! Its nothing but bad influence.! Teaching our younger generation to fight with each other as a joke. 1 punch can kill even if ur messing around [sic].’

This video from the NT island of Groote Eylandt, owned by, the Anindilyakwa people who speak the isolated Anindilyakwa language, was the latest fight to be posted on the Facebook page

Another man wrote: ‘Good clean fights... Brothers and Sisters we shouldn't be fighting each other but you gotta do what ya gotta do just keep it clean and shake hands after [sic].’

NT Police Acting Commander James O’Brien warned against glorifying violence by posting these videos online.

He also told the NT News that charges could be laid from the evidence in the films.

‘Police would ... like to advise that the videos posted may be evidence of criminal activity, such as physical assault, and may lead to involved parties facing criminal charges,’ Acting Commander O’Brien said.
