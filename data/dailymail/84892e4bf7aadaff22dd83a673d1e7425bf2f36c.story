A disturbing video has emerged showing a lamb born with human-like features in a Russian village.

The lamb's head had the eyes, nose and mouth of a human and only the ears were those of a sheep. 

After it was born, the lamb made a number of peculiar grunting noises as it was nuzzled by its more usual looking mother.

The human-like sheep, born in the Russian Republic of Dagestan, is nuzzled by its mother 

After being born, the sheep made a series of peculiar grunts and noises as it was recorded on video 

Sheep farmer Blasius Lavrentiev said he 'nearly died' when he saw the lamb as he was hoping to sell it

It was born in the village of Chirka, close to the Russian republic of Dagestan.

Sheep farmer Blasius Lavrentiev, 45, had been expectantly waiting all week for his prized ewe to give birth.

But he had a nasty shock when saw the human-like creature as he was hoping to sell the lambs. 

He said: 'We had quite a tough winter but when I noticed she was pregnant I was delighted as it meant I would be able to sell the lambs and start making some money again.

'But when I went down to see how it was going I nearly died.'   

Last year, the Villalba family from Centro, north-western Argentinian province of Salta, were accused of bestiality when one of their goats gave birth to a calf with a 'human' head and the images were posted on social media. 

The farming family were subjected to abuse and horrifying accusations by superstitious locals when the images went viral.

The  family were bombarded with accusations that somebody among their number had been having sex with their goat and had to strongly refute the claims.
