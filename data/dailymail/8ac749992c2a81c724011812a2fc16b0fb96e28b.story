A 'Zombie Nativity' scene in a southwest Ohio suburb has remained undead past the deadline to remove it - meaning the resident who created the display will face hefty fines. 

Sycamore Township officials said last week they had received complaints about debris at the home and concluded that the display violated zoning rules on size and placement of yard structures. 

They sent resident Jasen Dixon two zoning violation notices and gave him until the day after Christmas to take it down. 

Facing a fine and legal action, Dixon kept the display up. A Facebook page devoted to the scene urges support for 'freedom of expression.'

Display: A 'Zombie Nativity' scene stands on the front yard of Jasen Dixon's home in Sycamore Township, Ohio, near Cincinnati on Tuesday 

Holiday spirits: The scene has eerie figures including a demonic-looking creature sitting up in the manger where the baby Jesus would be in traditional Christmas nativities

Resident: Jasen Dixon, pictured, has started an online crowdfunding effort to build an even better display next year - and to help cover township citations

The township administrator, Greg Bickford, said Tuesday the owner will face fines of up to $250 a day. Officials say they're not anti-zombie, but pro-zoning rules.

'The property owner will be cited for failure to remove the structure,' Bickford said via email. 'Not the zombies, but the structure.' 

Dixon indicated he planned to take the display down, but not for forever. He has started an online crowdfunding effort to build an even better display next year - and to help cover township citations.

According to his crowdfunding page, Dixon has so far raised $758 out of a $5,000 goal. 

The scene has eerie figures including a demonic-looking creature sitting up in the manger where the baby Jesus would be in traditional Christmas nativities. 

There's a detached head with it in the manger, while another ghoulish figure holds a replica heart in its hand as a somber 'Silent Night' plays in the background.

'We do live in a free country, don't we?' asked Judy Giese, who lives down the block from Dixon on Vorhees Lane (not related to 'Friday the 13th' movie slasher Jason Voorhees). Auto paint and body shops line the other side of the road in the township nearly 15 miles northeast of Cincinnati.

Earlier this month he told Fox Carolina 'I wanted a nativity scene and I worked with what I had.'

'The neighbors don't like it,' he also said at the time. 'My father hates it and anything bad that happens he blames it on that. On the average we probably get 30 or 40 cars stop and taking pictures, getting out with their camera. People that follow zombie movies and stuff like that love it.' 

Giese said she and her husband took down their own small nativity scene and lights after Christmas, although they left up some little snowman figures for the winter. She doesn't mind if Dixon expands his display, as long as it's not into her yard.

'It's different,' she said, adding that it was quite a hit with guests at their Christmas party. 'It's like being next to an amusement park.'
