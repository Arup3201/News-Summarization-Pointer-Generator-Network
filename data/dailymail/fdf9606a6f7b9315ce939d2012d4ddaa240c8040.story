The ex-wife of an Oklahoma oil magnate who was awarded one of the biggest divorce settlements in American history says she is still planning an appeal even though she cashed the $970million check.

Sue Ann Arnall, the ex-wife of Oklahoma oil magnate Harold Hamm, cashed the check that Hamm provided her last week.

In November, an Oklahoma court ordered the Continental Resources (CLR.N) chief executive to pay his ex-wife about $1 billion in cash and assets when the couple divorced after a 26-year marriage.

Appealing: Sue Ann Arnall, the ex-wife of an Oklahoma oil magnate who was awarded one of the biggest divorce settlements in American history says she is still planning an appeal even though she cashed the $970million check

Pay up: Harold Hamm and his ex-wife did not have a pre-nup - the check represented the entire balance owed by Hamm according to the court's decision

Thanks: Hamm penned this check to his ex-wife for $974.8 million, which she cashed last week

The check represented the entire balance owed by Hamm according to the court's decision.

But Arnall has appealed the case in the Oklahoma Supreme Court, claiming that the earlier ruling allowed Hamm to keep the vast majority of a marital estate worth up to $18 billion. 

Legal experts say it may be more difficult for Arnall to pursue an appeal after accepting the benefits of the trial court's award. 

Real estate portfolio: Arnall also picked up three properties in the divorce, including this home in Enid, Oklahoma

The Enid home has been valued at $800,000 and was one of three the couple owned in Oklahoma

Arnell's appeal does not say anything about the property she was awarded in the divorce

Arnell also got the couple's second Oklahoma home located in Nichols Hill and worth $4.6million

'I will not dismiss my appeal and do not feel that my right to appeal should be denied because I have accepted, in the interim, a small portion of the estate that we built over more than two decades,' Arnall said in a statement through her lawyers.

Last week, one of Hamm's lawyers, Craig Box, told Reuters that Arnall's deposit of the oil man's check in an Oklahoma City bank was likely to end her case.

If she continues an appeal, Box said, Hamm will try to have it dismissed on grounds she has already accepted the benefits of the earlier ruling. The couple never signed a prenuptial agreement.

The Hamm divorce has been ongoing since 2012 and last month, Hamm pledged to appeal the decision, after a sharp fall in oil prices cut billions from his personal fortune.

The earlier court ruling allowed Hamm to retain his 68 percent stake in Continental, which he founded in 1967.

Hamm had already paid his former wife more than $20 million during the divorce proceedings.

Arnall has taken ownership of the Oak Ridge Ranch in Carmel, California, a property purchased by the couple in 2011 for $14.7million, along with the couple's two of their Oklahoma properties, as per the court's ruling.

Mr. Hamm will take their $750,000 home in Branson, Missouri and a $300,000 log cabin that sits on 154 acres in Major County, Oklahoma.  

Big growth: During the course of their marriage, Hamm's company's worth jumped from $50million to $20billion

Arnall made it clear she believed the marital wealth she was entitled to had been grossly undervalued.

The only spouse to ever score a bigger settlement in the United States was Jocelyn Wildenstein, who reportedly received $2.5billion after splitting with her businessman and art dealer husband Alec in 1999.

Arnell stated that she felt that the decision by Judge Howard Haralson to allow lawyers for both her husband and for Continental Resources to be involved in the proceedings was 'inappropriate' in that it allowed them to 'double team' her.

The crux of the argument though comes down to how much money the company and Mr. Hamm made beginning in 1988, the year he and Arnall were married.

During the trial it was argued that Continental’s growth stemmed mostly from passive factors, such as rising oil prices, and, under Oklahoma law, only the 'active' portion of wealth accrued during marriage in previously acquired assets is subject to division.

Arnall’s lawyers contend however that Judge Haralson miscalculated what was due to her by attributing only a small portion of a $14billion rise in the value of Hamm's Continental shares during the marriage - 6 percent.

'As Sue Ann has stated previously, 6 percent is not a fair proportion of the wealth the couple accumulated during their marriage, and she trusts that a more equitable division of the marital estate will result from this appeal,' her legal team said in a statement. 

Big score: In 2012,  Hamm was one of the select few named to the Time 100, an event he attended with his wife

Arnall, who worked as a lawyer for Continental when she and Hamm married, and went on to take a series of executive roles at the company, also claims that Judge Haralson undervalued her own contributions to the couple’s wealth.

Most estimates have stated that Continental Resources was worth around $50million in 1988 when the couple married, which is just a drop in the well when compared to the $20billion behemoth it is today. 

A behemoth that Hamm has a 68 percent stake in, a stake he lost none of in the divorce as it was determined to be 'separate property.' 

All this, combined with lingering timeline questions presented by Arnall that question whether strategic moves that ultimately yielded giant profits for the company happened before or after the couple's 1988 wedding, will likely cause this case to drag on for as long as two more years.

And there's somehow more.

Friends in high places: 2012 was also the year Hamm became an adviser for the Romney campaign 

That aforementioned $9billion fortune of  Hamm's was in fact a $20billion fortune as recently as August, with the oil baron forced to watch over half his worth slip away due to a drop in the price of crude oil.

Filing for divorce in March 2013,  Arnall alleged in court papers that her husband was having an affair, citing that as the reason for termination of the marriage.

 Hamm had over the course of their marriage grown to become one of the richest men in the world, a far cry from his youth and a true embodiment of the American dream.

Born one of 13 children to a sharecropper, Hamm worked his way up, picking cotton as a child, pumping gas and fixing cars by the time he was 20 and eventually saving up enough money to drill his first well.

And while  Hamm, who was previously married and has three children from that union, is no fan of the spotlight, he has not exactly shunned it over the past few years.

In 2012,  Hamm became a big part of Mitt Romney's presidential campaign when he was appointed energy adviser, a gesture he thanked the politician for by donating $985,000 to the pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future.

Mr. Hamm also hosted a fundraiser at his $4.6 million Nichols Hills, Oklahoma mansion for the Republican candidate, which raised more than $2million.

It is worth noting that the Nichols Hill mansion is no longer  Hamm's but, along with a $800,000 home in Enid, Oklahoma, the property of Arnall.

It was also in early 2012 that Hamm earned the biggest accolade of his life when he was added to the Time 100 for that year.

He and his wife attended the ceremony together that April in New York that also honored, among others, Marco Rubio, Supreme Court Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, President Barack Obama and Rihanna.

The two posed on the red carpet together, smiling for the cameras with their arms around one another, looking happy and excited. 

Arnall would file for divorce less than a year later.
