Running for Mayor? Alex Baldwin, pictured last week, could be serious about his bid for office

Hollywood star Alec Baldwin is seriously considering running for the position of New York Mayor, according to his little brother.

Billy Baldwin cast aside suggestions that his older sibling's flirtation in taking over from Michael Bloomberg in the top role was 'just for show' in an interview with CNN's Piers Morgan.

He said the 30 Rock actor's on-and-off political aspirations were 'on one level [...] very real'.

He said: 'I think he's very committed and extremely bright and knowledgeable and I think he could do it and he could run.

'On the other hand, I'm not quite sure if he's cut from the proper cloth because it requires a lot of tolerance and a lot of patience.'

Morgan noted that the 54-year-old, who told Vanity Fair this week how he fantasised about murdering his ex-wife Kim Basinger's lawyer during their bitter child custody battle, had a reputation for being 'temperamental' and 'a bit hot-headed'.

But Billy said these attributes were not necessarily a bad thing.

And he added: 'Let me remind you that John McCain and Rudy Giuliani are quite the same.

'They are very successful and highly effective politicians.'

Baldwin married 28-year-old yoga instructor Hilaria Thomas on Sunday, and had a series of run-ins with paparazzi photographers in the run-up to the big day.

He is also known for his rants on Twitter and last December was thrown off a plane after he refused to stop playing a scrabble game on his smart phone.

In the Vanity Fair interview, Baldwin admitted he is still considering going into politics, and that he has already once toyed with the idea of running for New York Mayor.

He said: 'I think I do want to go into politics. I really, really do. And I don’t know if I will. If I want to run, run for what? You have to stop and ask a lot of whys. Run for the glory?

'Run to complete some missing piece of myself? I can keep doing what I’m doing for a living now and be perfectly happy.'

But in the same interview he also said he wanted Harvey Levin, creator of the hugely successful website TMZ.com, to die a violent death.

His 'revenge' was for Levin posting a voicemail recording where he called his then 11-year-old daughter Ireland a 'rude thoughtless little pig.

Baldwin said: 'I wanted to stick a knife in him and gut him and kill him and I wanted him to die breathing his last breath looking into my eyes.'

In the interview, which took place 
before his weekend wedding in New York, Baldwin said he has learned to 
control his anger issues.

'You have to let that go,' he said. 'Enough time - I mean, it does heal wounds.'

Although he didn't think he would marry again after his split with Kim, Alec revealed he couldn't help falling for Hilaria, who he credits with putting him on a diet and keeping him away from alcohol.

He said: 'I thought, I'm probably never going to meet somebody like this again, and so I decided I would get married.. which is kind of mind-blowing to me.'

But his 'change' from hothead to peaceful man may take longer than he thinks.

Last month, Baldwin was involved in an unseemly altercation with a photographer after collecting his marriage licence.

He was seen lurching at tabloid news photographer Marcus Santos outside the city Marriage Licence Bureau as he left the office with his then fianceé.

Santos, who works for the New York Daily News, later claimed the 30 Rock star 'punched' him in the face outside the office.

He told the newspaper: 'He comes after me, starts shoving and punching me - one time, right in the chin.' But Baldwin maintained on Twitter that he was provoked.

Baldwin tweeted soon after the incident: 'A photographer’ almost hit me in the face with his camera this morning. #allpaparazzishouldbewaterboarded'.

He added later: 'It's sad w the tabloid press. They attempt 2 provoke an incident + when it doesn't pan out, they say u did it anyway... #no1punchedany1'
