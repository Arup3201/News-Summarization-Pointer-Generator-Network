Although smartwatches are a relatively new tech trend, Apple was working on a version as far back as 2011, according to its latest patent.

The files detail a wristband fitted with a detachable electronic touchscreen device.

The shape and size of the device in the patent images resembles a sixth-generation iPod Nano and in one design, the word iTime is written on its face.

Apple's latest patent was filed in 2011 and awarded today. It details a wristband (pictured) fitted with a detachable electronic touchscreen, which resembles the shape and size of the sixth-generation iPod Nano

Speculation around Apple's iWatch began at the end of 2012 and a rumoured release date was initially set for the end of 2013.

Speculation
 around Apple's iWatch began at the end of 2012 and a rumoured release 
date was initially set for the fourth quarter of 2013.

Chinese websites reported in December 2012 that the computer giant was working with chip-maker Intel on a wrist-worn gadget.

It was said to have a 1.5-inch screen and use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices, including an iPhone.

Other
 rumours suggest the iWatch will feature Siri voice controls that let 
users dictate messages, rather than use the tiny screen.

The watch could also be used as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video, on the phone or tablet.

In July last year, reports in the Financial Times said Apple was hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its iWatch.

Last year the firm was awarded a patent for the name 'iWatch', but it’s still unclear what Apple’s much-rumoured wristband will be called.

The latest patent was filed almost three years ago to the day, on 20 July 2011.

Called ‘Wrist-worn electronic device and methods therefor’, the patent said: ‘An electronic wristband to be worn on a wrist of a user, comprising a central portion having a receptacle area configured to receive and electrically connect to a mobile electronic device, the mobile electronic device including a display and being independently useable, and at least one band portion coupled to the central portion.’

Put more simply, this means the device could be used in its own right, even when not connected to the wristband.

Images also reveal the electronic device could slot in, and out, of the band similar to the Fitbit or Withings Pulse O2 activity trackers.

One image reveals the name 'iTime' (pictured left), although an 'iWatch' patent was filed in 2013 so it's still unclear what the device will be called when it's eventually released. The patent images resemble the iWatchz Kube band sold as an official accessory on the Apple store, fitted with an iPod Nano (pictured right)

The square shape of the device looks like the iPod Nano, released by Apple in 2010, and the whole watch resembles the iWatchz Kube band, sold as an official accessory on the Apple store.

Embedded into the strap would be sensors, according to the patent, as well as a ‘vibration module.’

The module would alert wearers to notifications, for example, while the sensors would respond to hand and wrist gestures.

The patent explained these could then be used to answer or reject calls and texts.

‘Another aspect of invention pertains to use of gestures with one's arm or wrist to provide a user input to an electronic wristband,' explained the patent.

Reports have previously claimed Apple's iWatch could double up as an activity tracker. This concept image reveals how the rumoured device and health tool might look. Dubbed the Diet Watch, it could track calories and steps as well as heart rate

‘For example, once a notification request is received, the electronic wristband can notify its user. The wristband can also seek a response to the notification.

Sensors including an accelerometer and a gyroscope will then correspond to specific movements.

Examples detailed in the patent include ‘a horizontal movement for one user input option (e.g., decline incoming call), and might be a vertical movement for another user input option (e.g., accept incoming call).’

Alternatively, the gesture might be a single shake, bounce or tap, or a combination.

Earlier this month, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty claimed Apple’s iWatch is expected to cost around $300 and will sell between 30 and 60 million units.

She believes it could sell as many units as Apple's iPad, and far more than the iPhone in its first year.
