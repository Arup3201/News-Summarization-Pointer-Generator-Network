Twenty-one children between four and seven were crowded into a house piled high with garbage and human waste, forced to stand in line for hours for measly scraps that were their only food and were slapped or had their hands sticky-taped together if they tried to get more.

When authorities discovered the house in suburban Adelaide in 2008 the children were so malnourished their brains had shrunk, they had open sores and were suffering from scabies.

The six adults at the centre of the horrific scene  were convicted of abuse, but one woman never went to prison because a court ruled she was mentally unfit to stand trial.

Trudy Quinlivan, now 35, was freed under orders that she be closely supervised in the community. 

But she is now wanted by police for allegedly failing to live up to the conditions of her release, and disappearing.

A warrant has been issued for the arrest of a woman involved in an Adelaide house of horrors child abuse case where 21 children were found to be living among swarms of cockroaches, flies and maggots and faeces on the floor in 2008

The South Australian Housing Trust home was uncovered by authorities in 2008 after one of the young boys was taken to the Lyell McEwan Hospital after fainting from malnutrition and hypothermia 

Quinlivan was found unfit to stand trial due to mental incompetence in 2011 after she was found to have seriously abused five children living in the Adelaide house seven years ago.

She was released into the community on a nine-year supervision order, but the Supreme Court was told on Friday she had breached some of its conditions and was missing.  

Lucy Boord, for the Director of Public Prosecutions, said Quinlivan had failed to obey the directions of her corrections officer, had twice tested positive to drugs and was not at the address where she was required to live.

Her mental health team have not been able to locate her.

Justice Ann Vanstone agreed to issue the warrant, requiring her to be brought before the court for a review of her release licence.

Quinlivan was one of six people charged over the abuse of the children, aged between four and seven, who were starved to the point of malnutrition and forced to stand in a line for days on end.

The five siblings were among 21 children living in the Adelaide house and were fed only scraps of food over a four-month period.

The children, who were underweight, had open sores on their legs, ulcers on their feet and were infected with scabies.

Examinations showed their brains had shrunk from the deprivation to basic nutrients, according to The Advertiser. 

They were forced to stand in line with their hands on their heads and were fed enough to keep them alive, risking being slapped and choked if they tried to move.

Their hands were also tied with sticky tape at night to prevent them from obtaining more to eat.  

Photos of the squalid conditions were released by police and detailed the shocking living environment the children were forced to live in.

Five years after the discovery of the house, the South Australian government released a response to the recommendations made by Child Death and Serious Injury Committee

It was alleged by one of the victims of the abuse that a welfare worker from Families SA was aware that the children were living in the squalid conditions, failed to alert authorities 

Human waste was found amid the piles of clothes, garbage and other refuse in the house where the children were living in shocking conditions

It was alleged by one of the victims of the abuse that a welfare worker from Families SA was aware that the children were living in the squalid conditions, failed to alert authorities.

A child protection worker, who is now engaged to a relative of one of the men charged in the case, reportedly visited the house on many occasions, but would not enter and instead sat outside.

The welfare worker was not under any legal obligations to report the conditions as she was not officially assigned to any cases involving the property.

'The first couple of times she visited ... she was friends of the adults ... she had been inside the house,' the woman said.

'Other times she came, she would only sit out the front of the house.' 

Five years after the discovery of the house, the South Australian government released a response to the recommendations made by Child Death and Serious Injury Committee. 

There was allegedly 'almost no information known about the children to state authorities' until the boy was taken to hospital, according to Committee chairwoman Deej Eszenyi. 

Different agencies including Families SA had records of the children and Ms Eszenyi said that if the different bodies had shared information more might been done sooner. 

'There was a possibility that the house might have been entered before the crimes against these children occurred,' she said. 

Lucy Boord, for the Director of Public Prosecutions, said Quinlivan had failed to obey the directions of her corrections officer, had twice tested positive to drug tests and was not at the address where she was required to live

The children who were aged between four and seven were discovered in 2008 and the ringleaders of the abuse were sentenced in 2011
