Harry Kane may be handed his first Premier League start of the season on Sunday as Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino looks to add more goals to his team.

Spurs have not scored more than once in a league game since a 2-2 draw against Sunderland on September 13 and their profligacy has played a part in a poor run of form.

Defeat at home to Newcastle last weekend means Pochettino has seen his side take just four points in the league since the end of August.

Kane leads the scoring charts at White Hart Lane but has yet to find the back of the net in the Premier League, having made just five substitute appearances.

Pochettino has warned the England Under 21 international that he must be patient as he utilises both Emmanuel Adebayor and Roberto Soldado but admits he may be tempted to throw Kane into the side at Villa Park.

'Yes, maybe' he said when asked if Kane could be handed his maiden league start of the campaign.

'We are very happy with him. Everyone is very important. But it's not difficult. It's a good thing he is scoring goals.

'Always we manage, share the minutes (between the strikers). We are happy w8ith all our strikers. Adebayor scored against Newcastle, Soldado was very, very good the last game. Harry the same.

Roberto Soldado has struggled for goals since joining from Valencia for £28million in the summer of 2013

'We need to score more, it's true. But we are improving and I hope our strikers score more goals.'

A poor run of form leaves Tottenham in the bottom half of the table but former Southampton boss Pochettino believes their all-round play is deserving of more.

'I don't feel the pressure,' he added.

'I'm not happy about the results. We need to improve. I am disappointed but the results don't reflect the performances. (We are not where we deserve but we still believe in our job and our way. We need to get three points on Sunday.'

Pochettino also confirmed it remains 'impossible' to predict when England full-back Kyle Walker will be fit following a long-standing pelvic injury which has seen him sidelined since March - whilst any move to bring DeAndre Yedlin in during the January transfer window could be hit by a work permit hold up.

The 21-year-old, who appeared for the United States at the World Cup, has already agreed a four-year deal at White Hart Lane but remains on loan at Seattle Sounders and could yet stay in Major League Soccer until the summer.
