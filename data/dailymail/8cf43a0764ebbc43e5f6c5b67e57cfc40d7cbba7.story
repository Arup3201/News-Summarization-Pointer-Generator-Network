The East Coast prefers Bud Light, and those near the coast are more likely to prefer wine over beer, a new study of America's drinking habits has revealed.

Researchers analysed a million tweets to find out which each region prefers.

They found tweet preferences for Bud Light were found mainly in the Eastern half of the US, while preferences for Coors Light originate in the Western half, particularly near Colorado and surrounding states. 

The East Coast prefers Bud Light, and those near the coast are more likely to prefer wine over beer, a new study of America's drinking habits has revealed. Researchers analysed a million tweets to make the finding

One million geotagged tweets (that is, tweets with associated locational data) containing the keywords 'wine,' 'beer,' and a range of top selling or well established 'cheap' brands of predominately light and pale lagers were included in the analysis.

The tweets were sent between June 2012 and May 2013 by US residents.

Other beer spaces included Miller Lite preferences in the Midwest and Great Plains, and brands like Corona and Dos Equis in the Southern border regions of the US. 

Most wine-related tweets were sent from the wine-growing regions of Washington, Oregon, and northern and central California.

Overall, residents of the eastern and western US coastal regions were more partial to wine (or at least were more likely to tweet about it), while people from several Midwestern states and into Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas were more apt to tweet about beer.

University of Kentucky geographers Matthew Zook and Ate Poorthuis analysed over a million tweets to produce the maps for a new book, The Geography of Beer, published by Springer.

They say the beer preferences often reflected an areas history.

'The Twitter maps quite accurately reflect various regions’ history and cultural practices surrounding beer production and consumption, and show just how much reality and cyberspace overlap,' said Zook.

Beer or wine? The team also analysed what people prefer to drink, and say wine drinkers tend to live near the coast

While the dominance of top-selling Bud Light and Coors Light in the “light beer cyberspace” of Twitter is not surprising, geographic preference for Coors Light in the Western US showcased the overall preferences in certain regional and state markets, the team said..

This regional preference became more prevalent when examining the tweets of beers with smaller market shares, including Busch Light, Yuengling, Grain Belt, and even Sam Adams.

Even preference for beer or wine was geographically evident when mapped.

Most wine-related tweets were sent from the wine-growing regions of Washington, Oregon, and northern and central California.

Overall, residents of the eastern and western US coastal regions were more partial to wine (or at least were more likely to tweet about it), while people from several Midwestern states and into Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas were more apt to tweet about beer.

The found smaller beers tended to be very localised in their popularity

Poorthuis said, 'Beer, like many other social practices, may be millenniums old but the socio-spatial practices associated with it – checking into a brewery, posting a review, geotagging a photo – continue to evolve and therefore our approaches to data and research must also evolve to capture these geographies.'

These insights into how Americans tweet about their favorite beers are featured in The Geography of Beer edited by Mark Patterson and Nancy Hoalst Pullen.

The new book provides an authoritative overview on aspects related to the origin, history and flourishing of beer culture.

Beer in ancient Europe, the British IPA and other great beer styles, the biophysical geographies of brewing, and the sustainable trends in the craft beer industry are a few of the topics discussed.

Heatmaps of popular beers were also produced to show the popularity

Many beers were, unsurprisingly, most popular in their home areas
