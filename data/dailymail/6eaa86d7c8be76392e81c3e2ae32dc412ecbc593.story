An American tycoon has refused to rescue a doomed tyre factory in northern France because its workers are 'lazy, overpaid and talk too much'.

Maurice Taylor - chairman of U.S. tyre giant Titan International - issued the slur in a blunt letter to French industry ministry Arnaud Montebourg.

In the letter, Mr Taylor explained why his company would not be buying a Goodyear tyre plant in Amiens that is threatened with closure and the loss of 1,170 jobs.

Discontent: Workers leave the Goodyear tyre plant in Amiens which is set to close but tycoon Maurice Taylor has said he has no interest in taking over the factory

He told Mr Montebourg: 'I have visited the factory several times. The French workforce gets paid high wages but works only three hours. 

'They get one hour for breaks and lunch, talk for three hours and work for three. I told the French union workers this to their faces. They told me that's the French way!

'Titan is the one with the money and the talent to produce tyres. What does the crazy union have? It has the French government. 

'The French farmer wants cheap tires. He does not care if the tyres come from India or China and these governments are subsidizing them. Your government doesn't care either.'

Goodyear said on January 31 that it would be closing its main French plant and cutting its workforce in France by 39 percent amid labor disputes and plunging car demand in Europe.

Mr Taylor added in the letter published in the les Echoes financial newspaper: 'Goodyear tried for over four years to save some of the highest-paid Amiens jobs, but the French unions and the French government did nothing but talk.'

The embarrassing assessment of French workers comes as France teeters on the brink of recession and unemployment has hit three million - the highest level of joblessness in 15 years.

Four years ago, former French finance minister Christine Lagarde - now head of the International Monetary Fund - also branded leisure-loving French workers as 'lethargic'.

She told French newsapers: 'Instead of thinking about their work, people think about their weekends, organising, planning and engineering time off.

'If you say to a French person, "Would you like to be an entrepreneur?" all they do is run scared.'

A recent global study of working hours also revealed the French worked the fewest hours of any country on earth.

The report by Swiss bank UBS found the French graft for just 1,480 hours a year, with 27 days annual holiday - meaning they have more free time than any other nation on the planet.

Britons work 1,782 hours a year - 301 more than the French - and have 20 days holiday a year, making us the world's 36th most lazy nation, it was found.
