Shoppers stocking up on everything they need for a Christmas dinner face paying up to 28 per cent more than they did just three years ago.

The price of turkeys, potatoes, cakes, wine and chocolates have risen several times faster than wages, hitting families in the pocket.

Labour claimed the figures means there will be 'real worry' about the cost of celebrating this year, and accused the government of failing to boost wages as the economy recovers.

Cost: There have been above inflation rises in the cost of poultry, potatoes and cakes since the election, while wages have risen by just 6 per cent

With just shopping 11 days left until Christmas, all of the big name supermarkets have launched campaigns claiming to offer the best deals.

But figures compiled by Labour show how the price of festive favourites have risen dramatically.

Poultry has soared by 14.6 per cent since May 2010, hitting anyone planning to serve traditional turkey on the big day.

Even more alarmingly potatoes have soared by 28.1 per cent, more than double the rate of inflation of 12.7 per cent over the same period.

However wages have risen by just 6 per cent since the election.

Anyone with a sweet tooth will also feel the pinch, with biscuits and cakes up 21 per cent and sweets and chocolates 18.3 per cent more expensive.

The cost of a Christmas tipple has also risen, with wine and spirits up 14.5 per cent.

The figures also reveal that vegetables have risen by 7.2 per cent and beer 11.4 per cent, slower than the rate of inflation.

Squeeze: This graph shows the increase in prices since May 2010 compared to the rise in wages, which means families are having to make their money go further

Most voters believe they would be no better off financially under a Labour government, polling has found.

Around a third of voters - 32 per cent - think the opposition would leave them with less cash in their pockets while nearly the same amount - 31 per cent - said they would be 'much the same as I am today'.

A quarter of adults believed they would have more money, the YouGov survey for The Sun found.

Labour leader Ed Miliband's electoral strategy is based on the so-called 'cost of living crisis' and has included a pledge to cap energy bills for 20 months if he wins in 2015.

According to the research, confidence in the party's ability to handle the economy is low, with 42 per cent believing it would be in a worse state if Labour had won last time.

Overall the Conservatives are on 35 per cent, Labour on 39 per cent, Ukip on 11 per cent and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent.

Labour’s shadow cabinet minister Michael Dugher said: ‘David Cameron’s cost-of-Christmas crisis is hitting families up and down the country.

‘Out of touch ministers need to spend time around the kitchen tables of those paying bills or nervous about the Christmas shopping. 

‘Families are £1,600 a year worse off under David Cameron and there is real worry this winter that the basics are unaffordable, treats are out of reach and better times out of sight.

‘What we need is a lasting recovery for all, based on job-creation, a freeze on energy bills and support for working families.’

He added: ‘Families should be able to celebrate without compromise at Christmas but the fact so many cannot celebrate as they wish this festive period only underlines the damage done by David Cameron’s government.’

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it was trying to reduce food prices.

A spokesman said: 'Farming is now a global industry and is susceptible to the market when prices rise as well as when they fall. 

'The Government is working to reduce price increases by opening up global markets and promoting competition in our own food and farming industries.'

The government has been stung by criticism that despite a return to economic growth most people feel no better off.

Wages have risen by a fraction of the increase in prices.

But yesterday Chancellor George Osborne seized on figures from the Office for National Statistics showing that  average earnings were now keeping pace with inflation.

He told the Commons Treasury Committee: ‘It shows that median gross weekly earnings are increasing at 2.2 per cent.

'That is, of course, the current rate of inflation. So I think that points to the broader argument that I have been making, which is that as the economy recovers, that is the route to a sustained increase in the living standards of the people who live in that economy, and you can't pretend that the two aren't connected, that you can have a living standards plan without an economy plan.’
