Benjamin Allerton, 25, has pleaded guilty to one count of GBH and one count of attempted GBH

A drunk driver is facing a lengthy jail sentence after he deliberately drove over a group of youngsters in a tent, after giving them a five-second countdown to escape.

A judge was told how Benjamin Allerton, 25, targeted the group with his Peugeot van following an argument with them in Selby, North Yorks, in March this year.

The youngsters miraculously survived, but one boy who couldn't escape in time was hit by the van and later needed surgery for a broken arm and broken collarbone

York Crown Court heard today how Allerton approached the youngsters, who had been camping in a field next to the River Ouse in Selby and asked them if he could have a cigarette on the evening of March 10.

Allerton began chatting with the group and stayed for a while before attempting  to put his arm around one of the girls while in her tent.

An 18-year-old member of the group took offence at his actions and a fight ensued resulting in Allerton being knocked to the floor twice before getting into his van and fleeing.

The court was told that, a short while later, the group heard an engine’s roar  - which was Allerton’s van careering towards the two tents.

The van smashed into a river bank where Allerton then got out and issued his harrowing  countdown before ploughing into a tent and injuring the youngster.

Prosecuting, Andrew Dallas said the group had initially welcomed Allerton, who  had been ‘showing off’ and chopping wood for their fire.Mr Dallas said: 'The evening started off amiably but as the witnesses recall, Allerton began to get nasty as he became drunker.

'He went into one of the tents and was seemingly asleep before he put his arm around the waist of a young girl.

'An older member of the group went to remonstrate with Allerton. It’s not known  who threw the first punch but it is clear that Allerton was knocked to the  ground on two occasions before being put into his van.'

Allerton is due to be sentenced at York Crown Court tomorrow and has been told to expect a lengthy jail sentence

Mr Dallas said Allerton returned a short time later. 'He drove straight at the tents but missed them and hit a bank at the side of the river,' said Mr Dallas.

'One of the witnesses recalls Allerton yelling "You’ve got five seconds to get  off my field" before beginning the countdown, missing out four and ploughing into one of the tents.

'One witness said the group assembled as quickly as they could but a member of the party could not be roused as he was severely intoxicated.

'The van then smashed into the tent and the young boy who was in it was found by his friends a short while later, some distance from his former position.'

The teenager sustained a fractured collar bone and fractured arm and had to  endure surgery on two occasions. He had to have pins and plates inserted.

Allerton pleaded guilty to one charge of GBH with intent in relation to the 16-year-old boy and one charge of attempted GBH with intent in relation to a 13-year-old girl.

The court heard Allerton had stumbled across the group while he was walking  home after having an argument with his sister.

He was found on her sofa at around 8am the following day. He was breathalysed and was found to be two times the legal drink-drive limit.

Landscape gardener Allerton, of Selby, has been told to expect a lengthy custodial sentence when he is sentenced tomorrow.
