Russian hackers with links to Vladimir Putin's government were behind an enormous cyberattack on JP Morgan Chase this summer, security officials believe - and they could have targeted as many as nine other banks.

The huge security breach, which went on for months and affected 83million accounts, took place last June and let hackers see the names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses of customers.

Accounts belonging to 76million households - and a further 7million small businesses - were hit by the breach, which insiders have now said was even bigger than first feared.

Data breach: The New York-based bank have filed a report to the Securities and Exchange Commission saying 76 million customers could have been hit by the latest breach

Sources who had been briefed on the attack told the New York Times's Dealbook column they believe the attacks came from Russia - and were a possible revenge for economic sanctions levied on the country.

Others said it was a warning shot designed to show Wall St how vulnerable their systems are. 

They also revealed that JP Morgan Chase - the biggest U.S. bank - was not the only target, and that nine other financial institutions were also in the hackers' sights.

It is not clear which companies were hit by the attack, or whether it was as severe as the one on JP Morgan.

The main attack began in June, and continued undiscovered until late July. It then took the bank's security experts until August to boot the hackers out completely.

No money was taken from anybody's account in the attack, and there has yet to be any evidence of fraud.

The bank filed a report on the incident to the Securities Exchange Commission on Thursday revealing the true extent of the attack. 

As well as giving the intruders access to records, it also impacted internal data held by the New York-based bank relating to users.

However the firm says there is no evidence that account information, such as account numbers, passwords or Social Security numbers, was stolen, meaning customers' money is safe. 

The bank says it has not seen any unusual customer fraud related to the hack. They added that customers who report unauthorized transactions to them will not be liable.

At risk: It said that the breach had 'compromised' user contact information - including name, address, phone number and email address - as well as internal JP Morgan data relating to these clients 

Increased security: James Dimon, chairman and chief executive of J.P. Morgan, wrote in his annual shareholder letter this year that the bank will spend more than $250 million annually on cybersecurity 

James Dimon, chairman and chief executive of J.P. Morgan, wrote in his annual shareholder letter this year that the bank will spend more than $250 million annually and have about 1,000 people focused on cybersecurity by the end of 2014. 

The bank operates in more than 60 countries around the world. It is unknown how many in each country have been affected, though the majority are Americans.
