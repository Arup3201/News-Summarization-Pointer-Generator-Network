Stick with Sportsmail today as the full 23-man line-up for Euro 2012 is unveiled at 1pm

Rio Ferdinand has been told by Roy Hodgson that he will not be in England’s Euro 2012 squad, pointing to John Terry being among the 23 players he names at 1pm.

When asked if he had been left out on Tuesday night, Ferdinand said: ‘Yes, it’s true.’ The snub is likely to signal the end of Ferdinand's international career.

Out: Rio Ferdinand, who played in Harry Gregg's testimonial on Tuesday night, will not be selected for Euro 2012 over doubts about his fitness, while John Terry is now expected to feature for his country

Goalkeepers: Joe Hart (Man City), Scott Carson (Bursapor), John Ruddy (Norwich)

Defenders: Glen Johnson (Liverpool), Phil Jones (Man United), John Terry (Chelsea), Joleon Lescott (Man City), Gary Cahill (Chelsea), Ashley Cole (Chelsea), Leighton Baines (Everton)

Midfielders: Theo Walcott (Arsenal), Aaron Lennon (Tottenham), Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (Arsenal), Steven Gerrard (Liverpool), Gareth Barry (Man City), Frank Lampard (Chelsea), Scott Parker (Tottenham), Ashley Young (Man United), James Milner (Man City)

Strikers: Wayne Rooney (Man United), Danny Welbeck (Man United), Andy Carroll (Liverpool), Daniel Sturridge (Chelsea)

The FA have refused to confirm the outcome of talks between Terry and Hodgson at Chelsea’s Cobham training ground on Tuesday but Hodgson has certainly resolved the issue of having Ferdinand and Terry in the same dressing room when Terry is awaiting trial for the alleged racial abuse of Ferdinand’s brother, Anton.

The FA stripped Terry of the captaincy, which led to Fabio Capello quitting as England manager in February.

The omission of Ferdinand and Phil Jagielka (understood to have been put on standby) as well as injury to Chris Smalling would suggest Terry has made the cut.

But Hodgson could still take only seven defenders, with Phil Jones covering as one of four centre halves and as a second right back alongside Glen Johnson.

Disappointment: Ferdinand, who lined-up for United in Tuesday night's testimonial for Harry Gregg in Belfast, will not be going to Euro 2012

Is Hodgson right to axe Rio Ferdinand for Euro 2012?

The players Hodgson plans to leave out received phone calls on Tuesday night breaking the news. Peter Crouch and Micah Richards are out, while Kyle Walker will miss out through injury.

Crouch’s omission would suggest Andy Carroll will go to Poland and Ukraine. But the focus will remain  on Ferdinand and Terry at Hodgson’s Wembley press conference, even if the manager will point to Ferdinand’s injury record as the reason he has been omitted.

Ferdinand has not played for England since last June. On Tuesday night, he was in action for Manchester United in their 4-1 in over an Irish League XI. The game at Belfast's Windsor Park was a testimonial for Harry Gregg, United's hero of the 1958 Munich air crash.

Ruthless streak: Roy Hodgson, who left West Brom officially on Sunday with the best wishes of the club's fans, has already made some bold calls with England

Hodgson also presented his new employers with a logistical headache when he cancelled next week’s training trip to Malaga in Spain.

He had already decided to give the Chelsea players involved in Saturday’s Champions League final the week off, as well as Wayne Rooney, and has now decided it is not worth going.

It could be he takes them to Manchester for a shorter training break before a friendly against Norway in Oslo a week on Saturday.
