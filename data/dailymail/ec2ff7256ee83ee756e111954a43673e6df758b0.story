A Brazilian beauty contest ended in chaos when the furious runner-up wrenched the crown off the winner's head, and threw it to the ground moments after the result was announced.

As Carolina Toledo, 20, was being crowned Miss Amazon 2015, runner-up Sheislane Hayalla saw red as audience members in Manaus, northern Brazil, captured the amazing scenes on camera. 

Other participants looked on in horror as the 23-year-old contestant  ripped out the tiara, threw it to the ground, pointed an accusing finger at her adversary and insulted her before storming off stage.

Distraught organisers rushed to pick up the crown and put it back on law student Carolina's head as security officials rushed backstage to reach her attacker.

The amazing incident took place on Friday night at a convention centre in Manaus, the Amazon's largest city and the venue for England's World Cup opener against Italy in June.

On Saturday, Miss Hayalla claimed her rival had bought her way to the title, insisting: 'Money talks in Manaus and I wanted to show the Amazon people money doesn't talk here.

'She didn't deserve the title.'

The winner declined to comment on the incident and would only say: 'This is an unbelievable feeling. I don't have words to explain the way I feel.'

The Miss Amazon winner will now represent her state in the national Miss Brazil beauty contest.

Organisers of the competition are deciding whether to punish the runner-up, who would normally be expected to participate in events throughout the year in representation of her state.

Miss Amazon winners normally do well in the national competition. Terezinha Morango, the 1957 winner, went on to win Miss Brazil before coming second in the Miss Universe contest of the same year.

Twelve women took part in this year's final. The winner won her place in the final by triumphing in the local Miss Manaus beauty contest.

Model and biology student Sheislane had won beauty contests in 2013 and last year.

An annual contest to find the sexiest bottom in Brazil was rocked by scandal just under two years ago when two of the candidates were accused of bribing judges to rig the votes.

Rivals accused Miss Bumbum finalists Mari Sousa, 25, and Eliana Amaral, 24, of paying thousands of pounds to the event's judging panel for the right to come first and second.

Dai Macedo, 25, from the central state of Goias, ended up being crowned the winner with her 42in derriere while Eliana Amaral, from Pernambuco in north Brazil, was awarded second place.
