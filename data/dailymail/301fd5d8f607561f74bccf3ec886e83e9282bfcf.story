David Cameron has called for 'tough, intelligent and patient' measures to combat the threat from IS terrorists to Britain

David Cameron last night held out the prospect of Britain backing wider military action in Iraq after vowing that he would not be deterred by Tony Blair’s disastrous war against Saddam Hussein.

Air strikes and food drops to help refugees being attacked by Islamic State (IS) fanatics were not enough, said the Prime Minister. Failure to take tougher measures would increase the risk of more Islamist terror attacks in Britain.

Calling for ‘tough, intelligent and patient’ measures to combat the ‘long-term threat to the UK’, Mr Cameron said: ‘The creation of an extremist caliphate in the heart of Iraq and extending into Syria is not a problem miles away from home.

‘Nor is it a problem that should be defined by a war ten years ago. It is our concern here and now. If we do not act to stem the onslaught of this exceptionally dangerous terrorist movement, it will only grow stronger until it can target us on the streets of Britain.’

Humanitarian aid was vital, but not a sufficient response to cope with any long-term threat posed by IS, he said.

‘We need a broader political, diplomatic and security response. This threat cannot be removed by air strikes alone. We need a tough, intelligent and patient long-term approach that can defeat the terrorist threat at source.’

Mr Cameron raised fears that the struggle against the terrorists would last ‘the rest of my political lifetime’.

He was speaking as RAF Tornado jets returned to RAF Akrotiri in western Cyprus after carrying out vital ‘recon’ sorties over Mount Sinjar in northern Iraq.

No 10 officials denied Mr Cameron was paving the way for British military action in Iraq – which he has repeatedly ruled out.

But diplomatic observers seized on his reference to the 2003 Iraq War, seen by most as a catastrophe for Iraq and Britain, as well as for Mr Blair personally. 

Government insiders said Mr Cameron’s comments were meant to signal that he refused to accept the Iraq War was the cause of the current crisis – or that Britain had no right to be involved in attempts to tackle it.

He is ready to back calls for more military hardware to be given to the Kurds. Previously, Britain was prepared only to transport weapons on behalf of other EU nations. 

But now Mr Cameron is willing to supply them directly to Kurdish forces fighting IS jihadists in Iraq – a move that risks drawing Britain back into the conflict.

According to military sources, British military training teams may also be needed. While the Kurdish Peshmerga fighters are noted for their courage, they are seen as tactically inept.

lLast night, the Bishop of Leeds, the Right Reverend Nicholas Baines, accused the Prime Minister of failing to develop ‘a coherent or comprehensive approach to Islamic extremism as it is developing across the globe’.
