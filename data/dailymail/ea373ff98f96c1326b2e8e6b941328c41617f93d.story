The brother of Cleveland's police chief has been killed and the girlfriend suspected in his death shot herself when troopers stopped her vehicle in western Pennsylvania.

A U.S. marshal initially said the woman committed suicide, but Cleveland police said later on Tuesday that she was listed in critical condition at a hospital.

Pennsylvania State Police said 36-year-old Dana Johnson held a gun to her head and fired once as troopers approached her vehicle during a traffic stop along state Route 376 in Lawrence County.

Johnson was sought after police responding to a reported shooting found 34-year-old William D. Williams dead at a home with a gunshot wound to the head on Cleveland's east side shortly before 3am.

The 36-year-old had been convicted of $5,000 of food stamp fraud in 2009, according to an indictment.  

Cleveland police confirmed Williams is the brother of Chief Calvin Williams but didn't immediately release further details.

According to NewsNet5, the couple were estranged but lived together and had two young children. 

No other arrests have been made in what police have described as a domestic violence incident. 

Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson said in a statement: 'My thoughts and prayers are with Chief Calvin Williams and his family. I ask that everyone respect their privacy during this difficult time.'
