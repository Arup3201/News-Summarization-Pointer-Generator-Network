An author has claimed he can help any woman land the man of her dreams in just 60 days thanks to his dating techniques.

Blake Lavak, 53, who grew up in Long Island, New York, and now lives in London, says his advice is based on methods that have been proven to work throughout history.

He says his book is based on the same principles that helped Wallis Simpson make King Edward VIII fall so in love with her he gave up the throne, and led Brad Pitt to become infatuated with Angelina Jolie while they were filming Mr and Mrs Smith.

Blake says: 'It is remarkable how easy it is to land a great guy just by using the right technique. And yet, so many otherwise capable women struggle in this department. So the question has to be asked, what are they doing wrong, and what should they be doing instead.'

He believes Angelina's stunning looks have got nothing to do with how she managed to bag Hollywood's hottest man - instead he says it's about 'standing out from the crowd' and 'taking control and keeping it.'

He writes: 'She doesn't have to have movie-star looks, or a flat stomach, whitened teeth or bee-stung lips. In fact, none of that matters at all, as long as a few simple guidelines are followed instead.

'Hard to believe? Of course it is... it is precisely because so few women really know how to land a big tuna that they end up with little sardines instead.'

Blake writes about his techniques in his book, Own that Guy in 60 Days: A Practical Guide to Love for the 21st Century Woman, published by Durham Press.

'The book is 'a result of seven years of research into the world of the single women, and it identifies what the successful women do right to ensure that they walk off down the aisle with a big tuna.'

Blake, who studied Psychology at The London School of Economics, found his formula for 'owning' a man after he found himself on the dating scene again following the end of his 15-year marriage.

His quest to find a soul mate led him to discover what he thinks women are doing wrong when it comes to finding Mr Right.

Blake's book is based on his own experiences 

He explained as he appeared on today's This Morning: 'When I started internet dating, I started working out certain patterns. Some of the women were effective internet daters, others were ineffective.'

He added that his sister also influenced his research after she struggled to find The One.

He said: 'My sister is attractive, there is nothing wrong with her but she was struggling to have a relationship and she didn't know why.

'She came to me and said, "can you help me out - this is what I do, I was taught in college to be cool and aloof, to stand back and let the guy chase you."'

But Blake said women actually need to do the opposite of this.

He said they need to chase a man and controversially, sleep with him on the first date.

He explained: 'Times have changed, sexual liberation has occurred.

'Women need to play it hot from day one. While everyone else is backing off and waiting to be called, you need to be proactive.'

He added of the successful daters he has met: 'They don't wait around. They will talk to a guy at a party and take charge and not wait for a guy to speak to them.'

He added if women want a man to fall in love with them within 60 days, they need to 'focus all their attention on him' and make him 'fall in love with the way you make him feel'. 

Another tip he has is to text or call a guy straight away to thank him if he has taken you out for dinner rather than waiting for him to contact you.

Be pro-active: Put yourself out there, don't wait for a man to invite you out or talk to you. Chat them up or ask them out first.

Buy them dinner: Show you are in control.

Don't wait for him to call: Get in contact with him after a date to say thanks. Don't leave it for days waiting for him to call. 

Sleep with him on the first date: Give him what he wants and he'll be hooked. 

Even better, on the date, you should have paid for his drinks and dinner and 'put him on a pedestal'. 

This Morning's resident relationship expert Denise Robertson disagreed with Blake's advice. She said women shouldn't make it 'all about the man' and put all his needs first and she was shocked that Blake was recommending women jump straight into bed with a man.

She said a healthy relationship isn't about a woman 'controlling' a man and treating him like he's stupid. Rather, she said a couple will fall in love if they are compatible and honest with one another. 

But Blake said women do need to play games in order to be successful - 'that's why it's called the mating game,' he said.
