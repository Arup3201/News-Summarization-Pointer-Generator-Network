A VERY COURAGEOUS DECISION: THE INSIDE STORY OF YES MINISTER by Graham McCann (Aurum £20)

Exhausted by all the horrors in the world, we begin instead possibly the most fascinating of all pub conversations: which is the greatest British sitcom there has ever been?

You might argue for Porridge, or possibly Fawlty Towers. I’m willing to hear evidence on behalf of Dad’s Army, and Blackadder (second and third series).

But, as in all such debates, each of us has already made up his mind before a word has been spoken. My vote, as always, goes to Yes Minister and Yes, Prime Minister.

It’s easy to forget just how different and ground-breaking Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn’s series was.

In 1979, when the BBC commissioned it, the sitcom landscape was bleak. Terry And June ruled the airwaves. Are You Being Served? had bedded down and was in for the long-haul.

If you wanted intelligent comedy, deftly written and skilfully acted, making jokes no one had made before, you might as well have looked out of the window, because there wasn’t anything like that.

But, as the prolific comedy historian Graham McCann points out, there had been something of a tradition in British comedy of laughing at civil servants.

On radio, The Men From The Ministry had worked this seam in the 1950s and 1960s, and I’m sure I’m not the only one to have fond memories of Richard Wattis and Eric Barker as harassed Department of Education officials in the original St Trinian’s films.

What no one had done before was pit a civil servant and a politician against each other and use their battles to satirise the process of government.

Paul Eddington’s Jim Hacker arrives at the Department of Administrative Affairs as its new minister, and something of an innocent. Nigel Hawthorne’s Sir Humphrey Appleby is his permanent secretary, and runs rings around him from the start. Derek Fowlds’ Bernard Woolley, principal private secretary, sits in the middle, referee and chorus.

The dynamic between these three very different actors was perfect — but they were enjoying themselves as well: they had Jay and Lynn’s delicious scripts to work with.

Jay and Lynn had met in the 1970s through the Video Arts company Jay ran with John Cleese, making videos for companies to show their workforces. Jay had the current affairs background (he worked on the BBC’s Tonight show in the early 1960s) and the establishment contacts. Lynn, a contemporary of the Pythons, had the comedy chops.

Jay was tall and Right-wing, Lynn short and Left-wing. They got on famously. Their scripts benefited from remarkably thorough research, assisted by several well-placed moles at the heart of government.

As Lynn told McCann: ‘We exaggerated a bit, sometimes, to enhance the comedy, but we told the truth . . . We found that when we invented things, they had usually happened, or happened subsequently.

‘Most gratifying and astonishing of all, our inventions of “Sir Humphrey” and “Yes, Minister” seem to have entered the language as shorthand for Civil Service obstruction and absurdity in government. No writer could hope for more.’ The story goes — and McCann confirms it — that Eddington thought the Sir Humphrey part was the better one, and wanted it for himself.

Reasoning that Jim Hacker needed Eddington’s warmth and vulnerability, Jay and Lynn persuaded him that Hacker’s character would develop over time, while Sir Humphrey could never change; he had essentially emerged fully formed.

But McCann puts to bed the notion that Eddington was jealous of Nigel Hawthorne’s success, even though the latter won four BAFTAs for best comedy performance to Eddington’s none. After all, what do awards committees know?

McCann talks about Eddington’s mastery of the character, ‘allowing [Hacker] to hide behind a carapace of authority but still showing, through those wide, spaniel-like eyes and that gaping mouth, the mounting panic that lurked inside. Eddington did not just show an idea entering into Hacker’s head: he also showed it bouncing about inside the skull.’ That seems, to me, a perfect description.

Hawthorne, by contrast, ‘was as fascinating to watch for how he was doing something as he was for what he was doing.’ How he learned those long, tortuous Sir Humphrey speeches remains a mystery. After that, King Lear would be a doddle.

My all-time favourite comes from the 1984 one-off episode Party Games, in which Sir Humphrey hears he is going to be made Cabinet Secretary.

Back in Hacker’s office, he breaks the news to the minister: ‘The relationship, which I might tentatively venture to aver has not been without some degree of reciprocal utility and perhaps even occasional gratification, is approaching a point of irreversible bifurcation, and, to be brief, is in the propinquity of its ultimate regrettable termination.’

Two things to note here. First, the ‘to be brief’ is a touch of genius all in itself. The other is that, as you’re watching this, you’re laughing not just because it’s brilliantly funny in itself, but because you’re looking forward to the expression of absolute befuddlement on Hacker’s face. Which is even funnier.

I must have watched it 30 times. If a funnier hour’s TV has ever been made, I would be amazed.

McCann has written books about Dad’s Army, Terry-Thomas, Fawlty Towers and Morecambe and Wise. He is also a lecturer on social and political theory at King’s College, Cambridge, so he knows both halves of this world.

His book is exemplary, everything we could have wished for. As well as talking to everyone and doing the legwork, he offers a critical acuity rare to this sort of book. And his conclusions are powerful.

Yes Minister and Yes, Prime Minister, he suggests, ‘did more to engage and educate the general public about politics, in 38 short episodes, than most of the so-called “serious” means of enlightenment had done since the age of the great reform acts’.

Suddenly, voters could see how government and administrators interacted, how policies were developed and how decisions were made. But none of this would have happened if the show hadn’t also made us laugh

Suddenly, voters could see how government and administrators interacted, how responsibilities were divided and distributed, how policies were developed, how decisions were made and how successes and failures were defined, described and defended.

But none of this would have happened if the show hadn’t also made us laugh.

McCann doesn’t think Yes Minister changed politicians very much: they’re still talking in daft soundbites and refusing to answer questions in interviews. He suspects civil servants are much the same, too.

What it did change, though, was us. We didn’t know before, but we do now, and as a result, we are much better briefed to fight back. It’s not the smallest of legacies.
