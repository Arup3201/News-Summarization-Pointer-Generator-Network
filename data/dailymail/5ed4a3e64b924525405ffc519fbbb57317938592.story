Chicago police are searching for two men believed to have beaten a 64-year-old woman and robbed eight others during a brazen Wednesday train heist just before the afternoon rush hour.

The two assailants were caught on surveillance video shortly before boarding the downtown-bound Orange Line train, pulled out guns and robbed passengers of their wallets, phones and jewelry as it rolled towards "The Loop" just after 4.00 p.m.

'I was the only one they struck,' Romelia Garcia told the Chicago Tribune. 'Incredible. Incredible that this happens in plain day.'

Pistol-whipped: Romelia Garcia, 64, was the only person on the train willing to stand up to the thieves, and she paid a price for it

Wanted: These two men are the primary suspects in the brazen daytime robbery

One of two: Police are asking for the public's help to track down this man and his hat-wearing accomplice

Garcia was assaulted when she stood up to the robbers and refused the hand over her purse, authorities said.

One of the thieves responded by whacking her in the head with his handgun before bolting off at the next stop, said police. Garcia fortunately suffered only a bruise to head and was able to be treated on the scene while being questioned by police.

Investigators have since released security stills they believe are the two men responsible for the heist, which happened after train left Midway International Airport on the city's gritty South Side.

They are both black men and believed to be in their 20s, authorities said. One was black and had a neatly trimmed goatee, but other details are scarce at the moment.

The photographs show the men leaving the Roosevelt station near the time of a robbery that occurred on the Orange Line between the Halsted and Roosevelt stations.

Lt. Ozzie Valdez said Thursday that 
some video and interviews with witnesses have led authorities to believe
 the two men boarded the train just southwest of downtown Chicago, 
brandished their weapons and loudly announced that they were robbing the
 people on the train, before going from person to person.

Valdez, who called the robbery an 'isolated incident,'
 said he is confident that the release of the photographs will help 
police quickly arrest the suspects, though none have been identified 
yet.

Caught on camera: This combination of surveillance photos taken July 16, 2014 and released by the Chicago Police Department shows two men on a Chicago Transit Authority train platform that Chicago police are looking for who they say robbed multiple passengers on an Orange Line train at gunpoint

On the run: Both suspects dart out of the Orange Line Roosevelt Station

He also said detectives were still reviewing surveillance video from the train and the platforms for further help identifying the crooks.

Miguel Fuentes, the national director of the volunteer-based community patrol group, Guardian Angels, said he also believes arrests will be made because somebody will recognize the suspects. And, he said, that will put commuters, nervous about the brazenness of the robbery, at ease.

'It's completely scary that for two people at 4 o'clock, on a train heading into the city pulling out guns and rob them like they're Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid or something.'

He also suggested the robbers would strike again if they were not captured.

'To do it at 4 in the afternoon on a train coming in from Midway Airport into the hub of Chicago… they have no respect for anybody, and if we don’t catch them, and we don’t turn them in, they’re going to do it again,' he told WBBM.

Where it happened: The two thieves boarded at Halstead Station and made a run for it at Roosevelt Station, the next stop on the train, authorities said

On the lookout: Guardian Angels are patrolling the city's famed elevated trains handing out wanted fliers in an effort to help capture the two suspects

Another Guardian Angel patrolling the Orange Line in the wake of the frightening thefts told WGN that it is not wise to resist a thief once a gun is brandished.

'Your life is more important than anything you can hold,' he added.

The robbery comes as the city deals with a surge in gun violence and has only further frazzled the nerves of the city's millions of people who rely on mass transit.

'I feel like maybe there should be more security now… especially with all the phones people carry now,' a rider told WBBM. 'It’s just really dangerous.'

'We pay our money for the CTA and you have all these cameras, you're charging us extra money and I mean, where was the security at,' Chicagoan Tracy Tucker asked WFLD.

Robberies on the CTA have dropped significantly in the last year, the agency said. In the first three months of 2014, nearly 100 people were arrested as a result of images pulled from the CTA cameras, it said.

Crime on the city's transit system has also been on a downward this year, the Tribune noted.

Thefts between January and March declined 23 per cent when compared to the first quarter of 2013, according to agency statistics.

Police have yet to identify the suspects or acknowledge there have been any solid tips leading them closer to any arrests.

The investigation remains ongoing.
