It's enough to make you want to lie on the sofa with a plate of  biscuits... one of the fattest parts of Britain has now been named the laziest.

Sandwell, which already has an obesity epidemic, has come bottom in a national exercise survey. 

By contrast, those living in the Scilly Isles were found to be the most active.

The research by the Department of 
Transport appears to show that the residents of Sandwell, near 
Birmingham, have been seduced by the sedentary life.

Nearly half the locals admitted they could not be bothered to go for a walk, while only one in 20 gets on a bike in any given month.

Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said they were ‘caught in a lazy rut’, but blamed Sandwell for not being attractive enough to tempt residents out of doors.

He added: ‘It’s a woeful situation where so many appear to have completely forsaken doing anything. But it’s little wonder.

‘A fat man might well ask his doctor why he should go out and exercise when all he can see is dreary buildings and all he can smell is the fumes from passing cars. What’s in it for him?

‘Councils must make sure there are areas in every locality which make it interesting to walk and cycle. I was in Sandwell recently and it has nothing.

‘We need places where people, particularly children, feel pleasure getting there and being there; parks and open spaces instead of ugly buildings and graffiti.’

The survey of 166,000 people in 326 council areas discovered that residents in Sandwell walked and cycled less than anyone else.

Over the space of a month, only 58 per cent said they took a stroll of at least 30 minutes, while a paltry 5 per cent claimed to have  ridden a bike, three times below the national average. 

At the top of the scale, Scilly islanders led both tables with figures of 86 per cent for walking and 59 per cent for cycling.

Sandwell – which includes West Bromwich, Smethwick, Oldbury and Wednesbury – already has one of England’s fattest populations.

The NHS says 40 per cent of children there leave primary school overweight or clinically obese.
