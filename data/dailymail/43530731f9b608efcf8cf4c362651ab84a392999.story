A milkman was sacked after he appeared on the Jeremy Kyle Show accused of cheating on his wife while he was on his rounds.

Shaun Dadds, 44, took lie detector tests to see if he had been unfaithful to his wife, who was also on the ITV programme in September.

Just hours after appearing under the title 'Is my husband cheating on his milk round?', Mr Dadds' bosses at Dairy Crest claimed he had brought the milk firm into disrepute.

They were furious that the milkman, from Quedgeley, Gloucestershire, took sick leave on the day of the recording, the Sun reported.

Dairy Crest bosses also said Mr Dadds had brought the firm into disrepute as customers may have seen him on the daytime show.

Mrs Dadds, 43, also angered her husband's managers by using the company's slogan 'Milk and More' in a conversation on Jeremy Kyle's programme.

She said: 'There was nothing there between us — not just the sex, but no intimacy, no affection.

'I said to him, "It says you deliver Milk and More but that seems to be the only thing you deliver".'

On the show, Mr Dadds took lie detector tests to determine whether he had 'sexual contact', 'sexual interaction' and 'passionate kissing' with another woman while he was in a relationship with his wife.

He failed all three tests because of a fling in the early stages of their relationship.

Milk round supervisor Mr Dadds was sacked from his job, which he had held for six years, in October.

Despite losing his job and the couple's marital woes, the pair have got their marriage back on track after Jeremy organised eight weeks of counselling for them.

Mr Dadds said: 'I thought they'd give me a final warning.

'It was worth it. Even though I have lost my job, it saved my marriage.'

Mother-of-two Mrs Dadds added: 'I feel guilty. We're left on benefits.' 

A spokesman for Dairy Crest said: 'Dairy Crest and Milk&More have stringent employment and HR procedures in place. We don’t comment on individual cases, but can confirm that all procedures were followed in this instance.'
