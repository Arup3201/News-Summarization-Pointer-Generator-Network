A young mother who was told that her little boy didn't have long to live staged a pretend wedding so her dying son could give her away.

Carla Marshall, 19, drew up a bucket list after learning that her two-year-old son, D'Shawn, who has multiple health problems including life-limiting epilepsy, was unlikely to live another six months.

Top of the list was her only child giving her away at her wedding, but despite a real wedding to her boyfriend of just one month not being on the horizon, Miss Marshall, from Wolverhampton, decided to hold a mock one.

Her boyfriend, Kyle Matthews, 22, agreed to stand in as the groom, local charities rallied round, and donations of wedding cars, clothes and decorations poured in.

A mother's love: Carla Marshall, 19, wanted her ill son D'Shawn, two, to give her away at her wedding

Heartbreaking: Miss Marshall said: 'Doctors told me to plan for his funeral, but I can't imagine life without him'

Last Friday, little D'Shawn, who was left severely disabled after suffering a respiratory arrest when he was just two months old, gave his mother away at the staged ceremony at St Michael and All Angels Church in Penkridge, north of Wolverhampton.

Miss Marshall said: 'I was so worried that he wouldn't make it as the week before he had been really poorly and in hospital, so I just prayed he didn't have a seizure.

'I know it wasn't real, but it was the only thing I wanted for us to experience together in the little time we have left.

'The highlight of my day was the first dance, which I had with D'Shawn.  He managed to hold his head up and looked straight into my eyes, it was pure love.  There were tears from not just me, but from everyone.'

D'Shawn slept on his way to the church but woke up as his mother walked down the aisle and the choir started.'

His mother, a former student, said: 'He didn't stop smiling for the whole day.  D'shawn can't communicate well but I know how much he enjoyed it, and two days after the wedding he told me he loved me for the very first time.'

Sick: Little D'Shawn suffers from numerous health problems and has spent much of his short life in hospital

Miss Marshall came up with her plan after doctors told her she should start thinking about planning her son's funeral, which she described as 'like a slap in the face.'

Her son, who can't walk, talk, hold his head up or eat, suffers from numerous health problems including life-limiting epilepsy, developmental delay, brain damage, partial sight, and microcephaly.

She said: 'When he was first diagnosed I didn't really know what to think - half of the things I'd never even heard of.

'Doctors have told me his epilepsy is life-limiting but I never really thought about my life without D'Shawn until recently.

'He has a seizure pretty much ever day, and we feel extremely lucky if he doesn't have one.

Church: The service was held at St Michael and All Angels church in Penkridge, north of Wolverhampton

'In April he had another respiratory arrest and I thought I was going to lose him.  His left lung collapsed and both his kidneys - I was completely heartbroken but D'Shawn pulled through and that's when I decided we needed to make the most of every day we have together.'

She told her family of her plans to put on a fake wedding, and says they 'completely understood' and supported her idea.

'He has the cheekiest personality; I can tell by the look in his eyes, they say everything,' Miss Marshall said.  'I can't imagine life without him.

'From the minute he was born he was just perfect, he loves cuddles and his favourite thing is Thomas the Tank Engine.'

'People keep asking me when I'm going to get married now but I'm not in a rush, me and Kyle have only become an item recently so we aren't even thinking about real wedding bells.

'All my love and time is spent with my little precious boy at the moment.'

Carla Marshall was helped by DADs charity, which helps fathers who care for children with special needs.
