Aston Villa haven’t scored for four games, and they have scored only one goal in their last six outings in the Premier League. 

Their tally of just 11 goals in 21 games so far this season is pathetic – it’s comfortably the lowest total in the Premier League and it’s less than half the number Queens Park Rangers have managed.

Losing 1-0 at Leicester City on Saturday was as bad as it gets for Villa. They created virtually nothing, the fans booed them at half-time and full-time, chanted for Paul Lambert to go and told the manager he didn’t know what he was doing.

Paul Lambert is under pressure as his Aston Villa side continue to slide down the Premier League table

Aston Villa is one of England’s finest football clubs. The leading representative of England’s second city, they have reigned supreme at home and in Europe in the past and have a stadium that is the envy of many.

But on the pitch right now they’re useless.

If the fans are expecting a return to the Martin O’Neill days when Villa challenged (albeit in vain) for a top-four place, then that’s optimism gone mad.

O’Neill left because he didn’t want to work within financial restrictions imposed by owner Randy Lerner. Lambert has taken the job on, occasionally he has got Villa playing some decent stuff but those games have been too infrequent, and right now they are non-existent.

Aston Villa shouldn’t be contenders at the top, but they shouldn’t be this bad. Fans fear a relegation fight and with good reason.

I believe Lambert is a good manager who has lost his way. Fielding a midfield three of Ashley Westwood, Carlos Sanchez and Tom Cleverley against a team bottom of the table with only one home win all season is shameful. I’m a fan of Westwood as a holding midfielder, there’s a hint of Michael Carrick about him. But in terms of invention and creation there is nothing.

Further forward, Joe Cole looks like he’s retired already, Andreas Weimann’s progress has halted, Christian Benteke looks like he wants to be at another club while Gabriel Agbonlahor has everything a top striker needs – except that he’s a terrible finisher.

Elsewhere, contracts for top players are running out. Fabian Delph and Ron Vlaar will both have to leave in this window if Aston Villa want to make any money from them.

Take those two out of this squad and Villa are staring down the barrel of the Championship.

Lambert is working within the confines of the financial equivalent of a gastric band set to its tightest, so I have some sympathy. Fat chance of Villa returning to glory in these circumstances.

But he isn’t helping himself at all. His teams have no enterprise, and are definitely not exciting to watch. There doesn’t even seem to be an intention to entertain the fans.

Losing is never good, but fans would be more willing to forgive if you were trying to do something positive. But losing while stinking the place out is harder to accept so that’s why Lambert is getting relentless grief from the fans.

Ron Vlaar is being courted by Arsenal and Aston Villa may be tempted to cash in on the defender this month 

The Villa story should be so different.

From the ownership of the club downwards, Aston Villa should be forward-thinking, progressive and successful.

Villa need an owner who can grab hold of the club and drag it back to where it should be. For a bright owner and for a dynamic manager there is the chance to achieve something special and memorable at a big club like Aston Villa. But nobody wants to seize that opportunity it seems.

Villa fans should be mixing it with Munich and Madrid just like they used to.

Right now they’re looking more likely to be slumming it with Swindon in the second tier of English football.

Sad times at Villa Park.
