Jailed: Emily Goode stabbed a university student in the back while performing a sex act on him during a one-night stand

A woman who stabbed a university student in the back while performing a sex act on him during a one-night stand has been jailed today.

Emily Goode met student Josh Nock in Lloyds Bar, Stourbridge, in October last year.

After spending time talking to Goode, Mr Nock - who thought she was friendly and flirty - decided to go back to her home in Brierley Hill.

Once they got inside the house, Mr Nock was invited to sit on a sofa as she undressed.

Goode, 28, then reached for a knife, the court heard, and began running the blade up and down the student’s chest.

Richard Franck, prosecuting, said: 'Things
started to turn rather strange. They were sitting on the sofa and he 
said in his statement that she came on quite strongly.'

Mr Franck said that the pair got undressed and started to engage in sexual activities.

He added: 'There was a knife on the table next to the sofa and she picked it up.

'She started running the blade up and
down his chest and torso, softly at first. He said she said "It turns 
me on, trust me, I won’t hurt you".'

Goode put the knife down for a short time before picking it back up again.

Mr Franck told the court: 'She then inflicted a deep scratch on his front which he said did hurt.

'He then shouted at her that she was a psycho, but she begged him not to leave.

'Goode started to perform oral sex on Mr Nock before telling him to turn around and face the wall.'She then stabbed him twice to the back through his shirt.'

The victim, who had to take pain-killers for three weeks, was not immediately aware that he had been stabbed, but managed to escape from the rear of Goode’s house after finding the front door locked.

He alerted police shortly after 4am and Goode was arrested at 6.21am.

But when officers arrived to take his
statement they arrested him after Goode also called 999 and claimed she
was the victim of a sexual assault.

Goode later admitted to detectives she had made up the rape allegation.

Offering mitigation, defence barrister Simon Rippon said he had never encountered an offence that included the kind of detail which surrounded the stabbing.

'Very plainly, she wasn’t thinking straight,' said Mr Rippon, who submitted that alcohol and cocaine abuse had been symptoms of an underlying psychiatric problem.

Goode was also sentenced for injuring a policeman with a shard of pottery during an incident in  Amblecote, Stourbridge, in May.

Goode, who admitted two counts of wounding, was told by Judge John Warner: 'There came a time when you stabbed this man twice in the back - that’s obviously a very serious thing to do.

'Sometimes that sort of act can cause immense injury.'

Jailing her for 27 months, Judge John Warner told Goode: '[Your barrister] on your behalf said the circumstances of this offence were unique.

'I can say, sitting here as I have done for many years, that they are unique in my experience as well.

'I won’t dwell on the circumstances that led up to the actual act of violence because that’s already been well set out.

'But the long and short of it are that there came a time when you stabbed this man twice in the back and that is obviously a very serious thing to do.

'Sometimes that sort of act can cause immense injury, albeit when that’s not intended.

'Fortunately his injuries were not as serious as they might have been.'
