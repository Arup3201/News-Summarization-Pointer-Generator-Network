Nivea fan: Alison Steadman says that she is not a fan of expensive face creams

She has the sort of flawless complexion normally associated with the most expensive face creams.

But look inside Alison Steadman’s bathroom cabinet and you might be in for a surprise.

The TV actress has revealed she didn’t start moisturising until she was 40 - and said her favourite product is a pot of Nivea Crème costing £3.99.

Miss Steadman, 66, was the star of Abigail’s Party and Gavin & Stacey, and has two sons from her marriage to director Mike Leigh, whom she divorced in 2001.

In an interview with Yours magazine, she spoke of her health fears as she grows older, and revealed she harbours secret regrets for failing to give her own mother Marjorie enough attention before she died in 1966.

The veteran star currently plays a discontented housewife in ITV comedy Love and Marriage.

Explaining her youthful complexion, Miss Steadman said: ‘It must be my genes. I’ve always had good skin. I never had spots or acne as a teenager, and I never used to moisturise until I was about 40.

‘I’m not showing off - it’s just that I never needed it.

‘I once spent a fortune - and I mean like a week’s wages - on a tube of moisturiser, because I thought, I’m in my 60s so I’m going to treat myself.

‘I put it on and a couple of days later I got spots. Now I use Nivea, which costs £3.99, and my skin is fine.’

Miss Steadman is not the only star to swear by the classic skin cream.

Invented in 1911, it contains more than 30 of the same ingredients found in the luxury Crème de la Mer, which costs £190 for a 60ml pot.

Other fans include screen veteran Joan Collins, 80, and Kate Winslet, 37.

Miss Steadman also credited her healthy diet for helping keep her skin looking young, saying: ‘I am also very fussy about what I eat and I think that helps.

‘I’m not faddy but I do try to eat well. I love raw vegetables and fresh fruit, and only eat meat about twice a week.

‘We all have health fears as we get older, and who knows, I might get diagnosed with something tomorrow, but I’m doing my best to be healthy although occasionally I’ll have some chips. And I do like a glass or two of wine.’

The actress, who lives in north London with her partner, actor Michael Elwyn, also spoke about the death of her mother from cancer.

She said: ‘I often think back to the odd times when she’d be telling me something and I remember kind of brushing over it, being to busy and not really listening to her.

‘My biggest regret has to be after dad died; I bought Mum a radio because I thought it would be company for her to listen to in bed at night.

‘It was - and she loved it. But one night when I was sleeping in the room next to hers, a song came on the radio that my dad, who was very musical, used to love.

Mum started to cry and then she was howling. I could hear her pain and kept thinking I should go to her, but I didn’t know if I could face it. I’ll always, always regret that.’
