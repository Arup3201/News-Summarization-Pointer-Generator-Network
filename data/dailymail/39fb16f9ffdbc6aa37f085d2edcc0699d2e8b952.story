A Friday night curry may be many people's idea of food heaven, but it's the traditional Sunday roast that has come out on top in a new survey of Britain's favourite meals.

Roast dinner was named as the ultimate comfort food by 43 per cent of those questioned, beating steak and chips, scones with jam and clotted cream and apple crumble into second, third and fourth place.

And chicken tikka masala, long cited by many as one of the country's most popular dishes came in at number 14, having been beaten by pizza, lasagne and spaghetti Bolognaise.

Pub favourite: Roast dinner has named as the ultimate comfort food by 43 per cent of those questioned in a poll of more than 10,000 people to mark the 25th anniversary of BBC Good Food

Chocolate brownies, strawberry cheesecake and victoria sponge were also among the list of favourites, according to the Independent on Sunday. 

The survey into Britain's eating habits was carried out to mark the 25th anniversary of BBC Good Food.

More than 10,000 people were questioned on their favourites, with traditional British dishes often coming out on top.

Some 50 per cent of those questioned by YouGov said a traditional roast was the dish they cooked at least once a month, beating spaghetti Bolognese at 49 per cent and curry at 43 per cent.

And despite not being able to walk down a high street without passing several coffee shops, the Great British cup of tea still holds a place in the hearts of many.

Some 41 per cent declared it to be their breakfast drink of choice, putting the beverage far ahead of coffee, which was favoured by 29 per cent of those quizzed.

However, when it comes to a takeaway fish and chips was beaten into second place by a Chinese meal, which 53 per cent of people said they preferred. 

The survey also showed that while almost half of Britons still eat together as a household every day, at least two-thirds of them are watching at least one screen and a fifth are in front of two or more screens.

Around half of people said they could confidently cook ten or more dishes from scratch but a full 10 per cent of the population say the cannot cook a thing - including 16 per cent of men.

The study also revealed that the horsemeat scandal appears to have had little impact on buying and eating habits.

Although 42 per cent said the scandal has made them pay more attention to where meat comes from, fewer than one in ten, 9 per cent, are eating less because they are worried about the quality.

Some 15 per cent are now eating less meat than a year ago in an effort to spend less money on food, while 65 per cent said they only sometimes, rarely or never visited their local high street food shops, with 40 per cent of them citing cost.

The microwave is the kitchen item most Britons cannot live without (56 per cent), beating kitchen knives (51 per cent) and a toaster (47 per cent).

BBC Good Food editor Gillian Carter said: 'The impact of the horsemeat scandal has meant that people are more concerned about where meat is coming from. However it is interesting to note that more people are cutting back on meat consumption due to concerns about cost rather than the scandal.

'Butchers also don't seem to be benefiting to any great extent. The vast majority of respondents only sometimes, rarely or never visit high street shops, with the perceived cost again being the most common reason.

'What is of concern is that five million respondents say they are unable to cook a single recipe. We know that cooking is a feel-good activity, with large numbers of respondents saying they felt happy, comforted or inspired when cooking, so the more we can encourage people to cook, the better.'

Chef Tom Kerridge said he hoped to see more men master the basics in the kitchen.

'We can see that overall the nation's cooking ability is good, but there seems to be a group who haven't ever learned the basics, including a disproportionate number of men,' he said.

'Cooking needn't be a big chore and is something everyone can learn the basics of and enjoy.'
