Jordan Henderson insists he 'loves' Liverpool and  expects to sign a new contract soon.

The 24-year-old, who was named the Reds' vice-captain last month and is viewed as the long-term successor to Steven Gerrard, has less than two years to run on his current deal.

Striker Daniel Sturridge signed a new long-term extension last week and Henderson is expected to follow suit as low-key talks have been on-going for some time.

'I am just concentrating on playing football. I am not worried about that,' said the England midfielder, who scored Liverpool's winner against West Brom on Saturday.

'I am enjoying my football, I love this club and I want to be here for many years so that shouldn't be an issue.

'I'll let my agent sort that out, it's nothing to do with me.'

Raheem Sterling, who has reportedly attracted the attention of this month's Champions League opponents Real Madrid, and Philippe Coutinho are next in line for new contract offers to reflect their growing importance to the team.
