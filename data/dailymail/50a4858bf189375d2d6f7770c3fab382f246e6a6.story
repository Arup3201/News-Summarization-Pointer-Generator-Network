A stripper who worked for the nightclub owner that shot President Kennedy's killer has now claimed that her boss was not part of a bigger conspiracy.

For the 50 years since JFK's assassination in Dallas on November 22, 1963, a range of wild stories have suggested that any number of masterminds behind the assassination and alleged cover up- from Kennedy's vice President Lyndon Johnson or his long time rival Richard Nixon or mob bosses and international gangsters.

Tammi True, who worked as a stripper at the time, has now opened up about how she believes that her then-boss Jack Ruby was acting on his own accord when he shot and killed Lee Harvey Oswald.

'Jack did it because he had the opportunity,' Ms True said.

'There were a lot of people who wanted to do what Jack did.'

The moment he fatally shot Oswald inside the Dallas police office was caught on film, meaning that there was no way to argue he was guilty.

Instead, the big question became why did he kill the man who crippled the country?

At the time, there were investigations into whether Ruby was pressured to kill Oswald in order to shut him up and keep him from revealing the true motivations behind the assassination.

Telling her story: 'True Tales' is the latest in a number of movies and documentaries to come out this year in honor of the 50th anniversary of Kennedy's death

Ms True, who is now 75-years-old, is featured in an upcoming film called True Tales, where she gives insight into Ruby and his possible motivations.

She said that there was no way that his killing of Oswald was planned because he overslept that morning.

The Dallas Star Telegram reports that Ms True said Ruby was headed to wire money to another stripper with his dachshund in tow once he finally got out of bed.

It was just a matter of timing, she said, that led Ruby to cross paths with Oswald as he was being escorted by police at the station.

Even if that is the case, there was some level of undisputed planning that went into it as Ruby had to make his way to the basement of the police station and jumped out from behind a crowd of reporters in order to fatally shoot Oswald in the stomach.

Many of the reporters were filming live so millions of Americans saw the shooting happen in real time.
