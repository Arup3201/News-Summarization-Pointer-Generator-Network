Barclays’ top investment banker has been forced out a month after scooping an £18million bonus.

And ‘casino banker’ Rich Ricci will be cashing in his chips again with a £700,000 pay-off.

The scandal-hit bank yesterday confirmed the fat cat will ‘retire’ – aged 49 – at the end of June as part of its clear-out of the old guard.

Pay off: Rich Ricci, Barclays director, is leaving the bank after 19 years, just weeks after receiving an £18million shares windfall

But in a move described last night as a ‘final insult’, Barclays confirmed that the former right-hand man of Bob Diamond will still receive the £700,000 golden goodbye – roughly a year’s salary.

Mr Ricci could also be eligible for millions of pounds in share bonuses awarded in previous years, subject to determination by the bank’s remuneration committee. Barclays chief executive Antony Jenkins thanked Mr Ricci for his ‘major contribution to Barclays over the past 19 years’.

Mr Ricci has become a lightning rod for public anger over ‘fat cat’ pay and the risks associated with casino banking, particularly since Mr Diamond was forced to quit last summer.

Mr Diamond resigned in July in  the wake of the bank’s £290million fine for rigging crucial Libor interest rates.

Other members of the old guard, 
including chairman Marcus Agius and Jerry del Missier, who ran the 
investment bank alongside Mr Ricci, have since fallen on their swords 
–with Mr del Missier receiving a leaving package worth almost £9million.

But despite the scandal on his watch at the investment bank, Mr Ricci clung to his job, until yesterday.

Confirmation of his departure comes just four weeks after the American scooped a £18million shares jackpot on March 20 – Budget Day.

Barclays was criticised for sneaking out 
the details on the same day as Chancellor George Osborne delivered his 
speech to the Commons.

Over the past few years, Mr Ricci has 
consistently been one of the highest paid bankers at Barclays, netting 
£44million in pay and share bonuses in 2010.

But because he does not sit
on the board, Barclays does not have to publish details of his pay and 
perks this year.

Business Secretary Vince Cable last 
night criticised the huge awards lavished on Mr Ricci during his career 
at the bank, which he joined in 1994.

‘The sheer scale of his earnings sits 
uncomfortably with what many small businesses are going through, having 
been badly let down by banks such as Barclays who missold financial 
products, causing enormous damage that is still being felt,’ he said

Luke Hildyard, from campaign group the High Pay Centre, said: ‘This feels like a final insult.

‘Despite Barclays’ attempts to smuggle
out details of Rich Ricci’s recent £18million bonus, the ridiculous 
amounts of money he has earned during his scandal-hit tenure at the bank
are well-documented.

‘A further £700,000 is totally 
unnecessary, particularly when you think what a difference a fraction of
that money would make to hard-up families right now.’

A damning report 
published earlier this month described how arrogant investment bankers 
at Barclays thought they were immune from the ‘ordinary rules’ of 
society.

Commissioned after the Libor scandal 
and spearheaded by veteran lawyer Anthony Salz, it described how huge 
bonuses helped some ‘lose all sense of proportion and humility’.
