Taliban terrorists who shot Malala Yousafzai in the head have threatened to attempt to kill the schoolgirl again if they get the chance.

The 16-year-old survived being shot by a gunman who boarded her school bus a year ago in Swat valley after angering the terror group with her outspoken and courageous public pleas for girls to be educated.

But Taliban spokesman Shahidullah Shahid said yesterday that the teenager remains a target after releasing a book about her horrific ordeal.

According to the New York Post, he said: 'She is not a brave girl and has no courage. We will target her again and attack whenever we have a chance.

Threat: Malala Yousafzai, who received a Pride of Britain Award from David Beckham last night, remains a Taliban target according to a spokesman for the terror group

Survivor: Malala, pictured here attending school in Brimingham, survived despite being shot in the head on her school bus in Pakistan last year

‘She accepted that she attacked Islam
 so we tried to kill her, and if we get another chance we will 
definitely kill her and that will make us feel proud. 

‘Islam prohibits killing women, but except those that support the infidels in their war against our religion.’

She was shot in the head close to her left eye last October after he repeated pleas for girls to be educated following a Taliban banning of girls from class in her home region of Pakistan.

Despite the threat of acid attacks and abuse against girls who continued to go to school, Malala remained defiant and was determined to be educated.

With her father Ziauddin's backing, Malala Yousafzai kept an online diary and did interviews with journalists to encourage girls to seek education - but it also made her a target.

The schoolgirl has described how she told her friend not to worry before she was shot because the Taliban 'have never come for a small girl'.

Her autobiography, I Am Malala, describes how the gunman fired three shots at her.

In excerpts from her autobiography, published in Parade magazine, she wrote: 'Some of the girls screamed. [Best friend] Moniba tells me I squeezed her hand.

'My friends say he fired three shots. The first went through my left eye socket and out under my left shoulder.

'I slumped forward onto Moniba, blood coming from my left ear, so the other two bullets hit the girls next to me... My friends later told me the gunman's hand was shaking as he fired.'

Her horrified friends recall that the Taliban asked for Malala by name before shooting straight at her head.

Everything, from schoolbooks to clothes, were soaked in blood and Malala was near death.

She
 travelled to Britain for treatment but her injuries were so bad that 
her father asked relatives to start arranging her funeral.

However, Malala slowly pulled through after being transferred to an army cardiology hospital with better intensive care.

She now lives in Birmingham with her family and started at Edgbaston High School for Girls in March 2013.

She
 has been invited to a reception for Youth, Education and the 
Commonwealth, being hosted by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, at 
Buckingham Palace this month.

Her
 story was featured on a Panorama special on BBC One last night, in 
which she spoke of how she struggled to adjust to life in Britain.

I was feeling a little bit embarrassed and worried because I didn't know how to adjust myself in the new system. 

‘Drama,
 music, art and PE is taught - we don't learn it in Pakistan. Here, they
 don't punish students with a stick... It was difficult to adjust to 
this new culture and society, especially for my mother.

‘We
 have never seen that women would be that much free, that they would go 
to any market. They will be going alone with no men and with no brothers
 and fathers.

‘In our 
country, if you want to go outside, you must go with a man - if even 
your five-year-old brother goes with you it's fine, but you must have 
someone else. A girl cannot go outside all alone.’

She also told the programme that UK girls take their education for granted.

She received a Pride of Britain Award last night and will be seen tonight on ITV1 receiving it from David Beckham after being nominated by thousands of members of the public for standing up to terrorists.

Her courage has won her many admirers around the world and she even delivered a speech to the UN on her 16th birthday.

She has been invited to a reception for Youth, Education and the Commonwealth, being hosted by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, at Buckingham Palace later this month. It is thought the Queen was impressed by her bravery.

Her courage has even seen her tipped for a Nobel Peace Prize.
