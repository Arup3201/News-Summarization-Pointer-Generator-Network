Labour is looking at proposals to hit taxpayers with a £250 tax rise – the equivalent of adding 2p to the basic rate of income tax – if it wins the next election in 2015.

The party’s equalities spokesman Kate Green revealed that it could reject George Osborne’s austerity plan – which is three parts cuts to one part tax increases – in favour of a 50-50 split, which would send taxes soaring.

Miss Green said: ‘The choices are about how you allocate the spending cuts and tax increases and I think that is seriously unbalanced under this Government.’

Asked about Labour’s plans, she said ‘plenty of proposals’ were being looked at but indicated a 50-50 split would be fairer.

Labour is still officially committed to plans drawn up by former chancellor Alistair Darling which would call for £67billion of savings in 2014-15. A 50-50 split would mean tax rises of £33.5billion.

The insight into Labour's private came as Ed Miliband vowed to force a Commons vote on plans to introduce a mansion tax

By contrast, the Coalition’s plan would see £26billion coming from tax rises.

That means Labour could increase the tax bill in 2014-15 by £7.5billion, and increase borrowing by £39billion to cover the difference in spending plans.

A Labour source said: ‘We will not make tax and spending commitments for the next Parliament until our manifesto.’

Details of Labour’s private thinking were laid bare as Ed Miliband vowed to force a vote in the Commons on his plans to introduce a mansion tax.

The Labour leader announced on Thursday that he would bring in a 1 per cent levy on properties worth more than £2million - a policy pioneered by the Liberal Democrats - to pay for a return of the 10p income tax rate.

In a bid to split the coalition, Mr Miliband will hold a vote in the Commons before next month’s Budget calling on the Lib Dems to back the plans in defiance of the Tories.

Labour wants a debate in opposition time but if they don’t get it they will seek to amend the government’s Finance Bill.

Mr Miliband will unveil his plans as he campaigns in the Eastleigh by-election today.

He will say: ‘We will force a vote in the House of Commons on the mansion tax in the coming weeks.

'We know the Conservatives oppose this measure, even though it would only affect a small number of houses worth over £2million.

‘There could be a majority in the House of Commons when it votes on our proposal but only if the Liberal Democrats vote with Labour.

'Now the Lib Dems say they are in favour of a mansion tax. Here is a chance for Nick Clegg to prove he can keep at least one of his promises.’

The 10p tax pledge was Labour’s first major economic policy announcement but Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has refused to say what mix of tax rises and cuts he would use to tackle Britain’s debts, let alone what the overall spending total would be under Labour.

Chancellor George Osborne’s austerity measures have meant that for every pound of savings made by the coalition around 25p has come from tax rises and 75p from reductions in government spending.

Miss Green cited former Prime Minister John Major in her Radio 5 Live interview as using a 50-50 basis to recover from the 1990s crash

But Labour’s Equality spokeswoman Kate Green denounced that policy as ‘seriously unbalanced’ and indicated that a 50-50 split would be fairer.

In an unnoticed interview with Radio 5 Live, Miss Green cited former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major in arguing for a different mix.

‘When John Major was trying to adjust after the 1990s crash he did it on a 50-50 basis. This is about public policy choices’.

Asked whether that is secretly Labour’s policy, she did not deny that a radically different policy is being drawn up. ‘There are plenty of proposals,’ she said.

Chancellor George Osborne came under pressure from Tory backbenchers to abolish Air Passenger Duty and slash business taxes again in the Budget.

Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, said: ‘Scrapping this unproductive tax would boost inward tourism as well as helping British people afford a holiday - but most importantly, we could expect an immediate year one economic boost of nearly 0.5 per cent of GDP.’

A Labour source said: ‘We have never said what split we would have between cuts and taxes. We’re not getting into what we would do in 2015 at this stage. The important thing is to get jobs and growth.’
