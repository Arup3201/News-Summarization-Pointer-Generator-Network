Could Theresa May lead the Conservative party? And what kind of leader would she be?

Last weekend, this newspaper broke the story that Theresa May wants Britain to leave the European Court of Human Rights. Yesterday, she confirmed that this is indeed her view. ‘Are we restricting our ability to act in the national interest? Are we conceding that our own Supreme Court is not supreme? I believe we are,’ she said. ‘I want to be clear that all options – including leaving the Convention altogether – should be on the table.’ And a Conservative Government will, she confirmed, scrap the Human Rights Act.

To pull Britain out of the ECHR would be to return justice in this country to where it belongs – into the hands of our own courts, and out of those of a distant and discredited institution which declares that prisoners should have the right to vote.

But Mrs May did not take this bold stance in isolation. It formed part of the first-ever speech in which she set out her political world view – ranging outside her Home Office brief to set out a deeply personal political manifesto.

It was a declaration of intent, confirming that she intends to be a candidate for the Conservative leadership if David Cameron loses the next General Election.

So could Mrs May really lead the Tory Party? And, if so, what kind of leader would she be? I worked alongside her as a Conservative MP in a neighbouring constituency  (I was the MP for Wycombe, she for Maidenhead) for the best part of ten years. She was an exemplary neighbour – helpful and supportive.

All in all, she had all the qualities of what Tory MPs call ‘a good colleague’, save one – clubability, that mix of approachability and gregariousness that helps MPs to rub along together.  Mrs May was a cat who walks by itself.

In the lobbies where MPs vote, they tend to mix in groups, exchanging news, jokes, information and gossip. But while other MPs would look for friends, Mrs May would stalk through alone, halting only for an occasional pleasantry or to buttonhole a colleague about political business, but never part of a group or gang. And with that sense of solitude came a fierce sense of territoriality.

Woe betide any unhappy MP or fellow frontbencher who trespassed into her territory or, worse, made a grab for part of it. I saw this at first-hand when she clashed with Sayeeda Warsi over setting up a new integration ministry.

At the time, Mrs May was in charge of the party’s approach to ethnic minorities, as well as women, and Lady Warsi’s plan would have torn off a slice of her empire.

Since I worked in the same team as Lady Warsi, I went to the meeting at which the idea was set out. Mrs May received us pleasantly and graciously and Lady Warsi began to make her pitch. As soon as she did, the smile on our host’s face turned wintry.

Lady Warsi had scarcely finished before Mrs May launched a blood-drawing counter-attack, utilising  every bureaucratic device  in the book to kill the scheme at birth.

Mrs May is a formidable operator, but not always one who commands the affection of those who work with her. Some senior Ministers allow their juniors the freedom to flourish. Others try to control everything themselves. Almost all of Mrs May’s colleagues place her in the latter camp.

When she returns home late at night after a division in the Commons or desk work at the Home Office, there will be few distractions from the toil of churning through the paperwork in those Ministerial red boxes. This picture helps to capture the sense of isolation that somehow surrounds her. But that concentration has served her well. In a department notorious for imperilling the careers of those who serve there, she has prospered.

She is unwaveringly focused on reducing crime, reforming the police and, above all, reducing net immigration – the figures for which are moving in the right direction. And that iciness is melting a bit. The Commons has changed since the last election. The Conservatives now have some 50 women MPs, and Mrs May seems more at ease with the new generation of Tories whose votes will be crucial in any future leadership election.

Comparisons are being made betwen Theresa May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel

She has an energetic team in the Home Office behind her, and the services of a sociable aide – George Hollingbery, the MP for Meon Valley and her Parliamentary Private Secretary – to draw on.

Senior MPs, such as the former Cabinet Minister Cheryl Gillan, speak admiringly of her work in government. And the Home Secretary is now offering informal ‘surgeries’ at the back of the Commons tearoom each week.

A year ago, her lack of clubability seemed to leave her an unlikely future Tory leader. But since then, she has put herself at the head of the ‘National Union of Ministers’ – the team of Cabinet members, including Philip Hammond and Chris Grayling – who have had enough of cuts to their departments. One Minister spoke appreciatively to me recently of how well she performs in Cabinet, and how, when necessary, she is prepared to stand up to George Osborne, the most powerful man in the Government.

Her team have been busy marketing her as ‘the British Merkel’, a future equivalent of the dour but effective German Chancellor.

The only element lacking to date in her quiet leadership campaign has been a wider view of politics to accompany the grasp of detail. And now we have it.

‘We have to become the party that is tireless in confronting vested interests,’ she said yesterday. ‘The party that takes power from the elite and gives it to the people.’

It was an appeal perfectly pitched for the marginal seats that her party must win in 2015. It confirmed that she is ready to lead if Cameron falls – not just after the Election but before it, if his disillusioned party overthrows him.
