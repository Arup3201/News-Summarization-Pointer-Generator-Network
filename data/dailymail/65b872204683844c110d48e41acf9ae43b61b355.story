Guatemalan officials have begun investigating seven arrests and two reported deaths in the Rio Grande Valley after a Texas state trooper opened fire on a speeding vehicle filled with suspected illegal immigrants on Thursday.

The Texas Department of Public Safety sharpshooter was trying to disable the red pickup truck as it was driving near the town of La Joya, suspecting that the truck was being used to smuggle drugs, authorities said.

The unnamed trooper has been placed on administrative leave, a standard practice for officers involved in fatal shootings.

Caught: A red pick up truck is moved from the scene of an incident after a chase between Texas State troopers and suspected drug smugglers near La Joya, Texas.

The pickup truck was first encountered Thursday by state game wardens who said the truck appeared to be a carrying a "typical covered drug load" on its bed and was traveling at reckless speeds.

When the driver refused to stop, the game wardens radioed for help, and a state police helicopter with the sharpshooter on board was the first to respond, according to a Texas Parks and Wildlife Department spokesman.

After the officer fired shots at the truck, just north of the Mexican border, the driver stopped. Seven Guatemalans were arrested on the scene, and no drugs were found. The nationalities of the dead victims and of an eighth person arrested after the incident occurred have not yet been released.

Guatemala's deputy minister of foreign relations, Rita Claverie, said her government will demand an explanation from the U.S.

"This incident surprises us because we had never seen force being used from a helicopter," Claverie said.

Humberto Palacios, head of protection and investigations at the Guatemalan consulate in McAllen, said the consulate was looking into the matter and would ask authorities to establish what happened.

Troopers are regularly involved in high-speed pursuits near the Mexican border, often chasing drug smugglers between the two countries. In recent years, Texas state police have increased their presence in the border region, deploying more agents, more helicopters and more boats to patrol the Rio Grande Valley.

Texas Department of Public Safety Director Stephen McCraw has said state police were pushed into that role because the federal government's efforts to secure the border have been insufficient.
