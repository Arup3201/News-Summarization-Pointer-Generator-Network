Often they provide a sanctuary for some of the world’s most endangered species.

But one zoo is turning out to be rather a dangerous place for some of its inhabitants, a whistleblowing member of staff claims.

First, a rare male warty pig brought in to breed with a resident female ended up eating all of their offspring – then fatally injured his mate.

Then an endangered species of monkey fell into a pond where it was attacked and eaten by hungry otters.

And finally three prize birds found their way out of their living quarters and flew away.

The whistleblower at Bristol Zoo claimed the deaths and escapes, which have all happened since December, were avoidable.

But the zoo, which prides itself on its conservation projects, said all three incidents had caused great distress to the keepers.

The first came after Manilla, a female warty pig native to the Philippines, was joined by her new male friend Elvis last September. 

At the time assistant curator of mammals Lynsey Bugg said: 'We hope the 'King' takes a shining to Manilla and the two become proud parents in the future.'

Eaten alive: In the same month, a golden lion tamarin (like the one above, pictured at Bristol Zoo) was eaten alive by American otters after falling into a pond where it became trapped

A spokeswoman for the zoo, which has more than 7,000 animals, said: 'In November Manilla showed some subtle changes to her behaviour and keepers alerted our in-house vet team.

'She showed no physical signs of being pregnant and, as she had not been with a male between July and October, she was well outside the known birth window for this species.' 

When Manilla unexpectedly gave birth to extremely rare piglets having shown no signs of being pregnant, Elvis ate them all in their enclosure.

The zoo worker said: ‘He then also attacked the mother by eating her rear end. She was so badly injured she had to be put down. 

'This meant the loss of a family of rare warty pigs that could have been avoided by keeping the male separate.’

Warty pigs are so rare that their numbers are unknown; the species is listed as ‘critically endangered’.

A couple of weeks later an endangered golden lion tamarin monkey escaped and fell into a pond surrounding its island enclosure.

The whistleblower said: ‘It was trapped in a drainage valve, and then eaten by American otters.’ The monkey is native to Brazil, where only 10,000 remain in the wild.

And a week ago three rainbow lorikeets, usually found in Australia, escaped through a hole in their cage and flew off.

The zoo worker said: ‘Only two were recovered. There is still one lorikeet loose somewhere in Bristol.’

A spokesman for the zoo said: ‘Manilla showed no physical signs of being pregnant. The birth of her litter and the subsequent incident with the male was completely unforeseeable.’ 

She added that the zoo has the ‘highest standards of animal welfare, education and conservation in Europe, as well as world-class in-house veterinary care’.

Will Travers OBE, President of the Born Free Foundation, said: 'Wherever wild animals are kept in captivity, accidents can happen. 

'However, tragedies can sometimes be prevented and the behaviour of the male Visayan warty pig in this case was hardly impossible to predict. 

'Males of many species are widely known to be a threat to infants, especially in captivity. 

'It would appear that better understanding of animals' needs and behaviour may have prevented such a tragedy.

'The general public have an expectation that zoos know what they are doing, and that they have in place measures to protect their animals and to avoid such incidents occurring.

'The tragedy at Bristol Zoo is almost certainly not isolated. 

'Predictable and preventable 'accidents' regularly occur and the zoo industry, and the Government which oversees the standards, licensing and inspection of zoos, must do more to protect the captive animals for which they are responsible.'   

Escaped: In another embarssing incident, three rainbow lorikeets recently escaped from Bristol Zoo and one is still on the loose
