Condemned: Warren Hill is scheduled to die via lethal injection on Tuesday, unless his lawyers can prove 'beyond a reasonable doubt' that he is mentally disabled

A fierce legal battle rages on over condemned prisoner Warren Lee Hill, who is scheduled to be executed next Tuesday.

In a last ditch effort to stay his execution, lawyers are trying to prove that Hill, 53, is mentally disabled and cannot be given the death penalty.

Three doctors who originally testified for the state of Georgia against Hill now claim that Hill is mentally disabled, and thus, should not be put to death.

Hill’s lawyers have continually argued that their client has had mental issues for the duration of his incarceration, and are doing everything in their power to spare his life.

Hill is scheduled to die in an Atlanta prison via lethal injection at 7pm ET on Tuesday night for brutally attacking his then-cellmate, Joseph Handspike, in 1990. 

Authorities said that Hill, who was already serving a life sentence for the murder of his girlfriend, Maya Wright four years earlier, attacked Handspike again and again with a nail embedded in a piece of plank. 

Handspike died of his injuries. However, the Handspike family has publically declared that they do not agree with Hill’s execution.

Hill’s upcoming lethal injection goes directly against the 2002 case, Atkins v. Virginia, which ruled that Daryl Atkins was ‘mentally retarded’ and was not of sound mind, and therefore could not be sentenced to death.

Dr Thomas Sachy wrote in an affidavit last week: ‘Having reviewed my earlier evaluation results and the far more extensive materials from the record of this case, I believe that my judgement that Mr Hill did not meet the criteria for mild mental retardation was in error.’

The other doctors concede and claimed their evaluations of Hill in 2000 were ‘rush jobs,’ according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Clemency: Members of the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles prepare to hear a clemency hearing for Hill last July

The state has said that Hill’s lawyers have failed to prove ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ that the man is mentally disabled. 

Lauren Kane, a spokesperson for the state Attorney General’s Office, declined comment, saying that her office will respond when Hill’s attorneys file new motions.

Hill was originally scheduled to be executed in June, but the Supreme Court allowed him a stay of execution while his attorneys pursued a challenge based on the state’s changing of execution method. 

Hill is among three Georgia inmates on Death Row fighting for a court order that would prevent the state from using a drug to execute them without a doctor’s prescription first.

Hill, along with Andrew Allen Cook and Marcus Wellons, argue that the Georgia Department of Corrections’ use of the drug without a doctor’s prescription violates the federal Controlled Substances Act.

Outrage: Troy Davis was the last Georgia inmate to be executed in the state; his 2011 death was highly controversial

Even if the court finds him mentally disabled, Hill would still spend the rest of his life in prison, the Journal-Constitution says.

The case has stirred a national outcry of those believing Hill to be mentally unwell. If he is executed, it will be the first carried-out execution in the state since the 2011 death of Troy Davis.

At the time, Davis’ conviction and condemnation drew fury, as many believed that Davis was the victim of mistaken identity in the murder of Burger King guard Mark MacPhail in 1989.

Prosecutors and MacPhail's family said they were certain Davis was guilty and that justice was served.

Prison officials also provided an audio recording and transcript of his last words, which he used to again proclaim his innocence and urge his supporters to "continue to fight this fight."

Davis was notified of the execution date on Sept. 7, and a day later he was asked to make a last meal request. He scrawled a response in big letters: "None. Will Be Fasting!"

According to figures collected by Amnesty International, the U.S. was the only country within the G8 to carry out executions in 2011.
