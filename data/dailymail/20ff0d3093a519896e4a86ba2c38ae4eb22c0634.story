There were three main incidents at Anfield on Tuesday night - one given as a penalty, and the other two waved away.

Liverpool came from behind to rescue a deserved draw against Chelsea in the Capital One Cup semi-final first leg, leaving an important clash at Stamford Bridge to decide the tie.

Here, Sportsmail's Graham Poll mulls over the three main refereeing calls from the match. 

Thibaut Courtois appeared to handle the ball outside his 18-yard area but was not penalised for it

Martin Atkinson was correct to give Courtois the benefit of the doubt as he could not get his hands away

The Kop screamed for handball as Thibaut Courtois slid out of his penalty area but referee Martin Atkinson, perhaps unsighted waved appeals away. 

When a keeper leaves his area you treat him as an outfield player and as his weight was on his arms again he couldn’t get his arm away and the ball hit him.

Costa - lying on the ground - seemed to drag the ball back, but Atkinson got it right again as it wasn't deliberate

Consistency again from Atkinson as he viewed Diego Costa the same way. Costa was on the floor inside his own penalty area when the ball hit his arm. 

With his weight on his arm he couldn’t move it and Atkinson was right not to give a penalty as it must be a deliberate offence. 

Jose Mourinho might want to reflect on refereeing consistency as Dowd saw a similar incident the same way when Chelsea lost at White Hart Lane.

Atkinson was also perfectly placed with a clear view to point to the penalty mark when Emre Can tripped Eden Hazard. It was a clumsy, late challenge and a clear foul.
