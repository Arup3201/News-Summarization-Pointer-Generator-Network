The owner of a dog reportedly shot by police officers is outraged and has called her beloved pet's death 'an execution.'

'Bam, they shot him right in front of my face, right in front of me,' owner Tracy Kirkpatrick - whose son was killed last month by officers following a police chase - told KRQE.

'They came towards the dogs,' she told the station. 'To me it looked like an execution.'

'They’re here to serve and protect,' Kirkpatrick also told the affiliate station.  'Their badge means a lot and they had no reason to do what they did.'

The dog was killed after Carlsbad, New Mexico police officers responded to an alleged fight, KRQE reported. A police report obtained by the affiliate station claimed Kirkpatrick's dogs were hostile to officers.

'The officer felt like he was fixing to be attacked by the dog so he shot the dog,' Captain Jon Moyers told KRQE.

During the incident, 'Kirkpatrick [...] allegedly failed to call off the dog despite instructions from officers to do so,' The Current Argus reported.

Her other dog was not shot and survived, the station said.

The Albuquerque Journal reported that in June, Troy Kirkpatrick escaped from jail when he 'assaulted the detention center officer and fled the area in a stolen vehicle.'

He was later shot and killed when he tried to flee a second time.

Police did not immediately return a request for comment from MailOnline.
