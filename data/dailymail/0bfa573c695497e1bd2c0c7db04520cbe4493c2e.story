Former Chelsea keeper Hilario has announced his retirement after being released by the Blues this summer but has hinted he could stay on at Stamford Bridge.

The 38-year-old had been with the west London outfit since signing on a free transfer from Nacional in 2006,and could extend his stay at the club in a coaching capacity.

Hilario took to Instagram to announce his retirement, posting a long message with pictures of his triumphs with Chelsea down the years.

End of an era: Hilario has retired following eight years at Chelsea and 20 as a professional footballer

Hilario said: 'Hi Everyone. After 20 years of professional goalkeeping I have made the very difficult decision to hang up my gloves!!

'It was not a sudden or easy decision and age played no part, but I simply could not refuse the offer that CFC proposed. I now have the opportunity to not only stay in the game but to pass on my experience and knowledge to a new generation of goalkeepers!

I just wanted to say a big thank you to all the teams that I was so proud to represent and all the staff that works on the backstage, to all my team mates many of whom I have worked with since day one, to all the managers and coaches that have helped me become not only a better player but a better man.

'For that I will always be grateful. I have been so lucky and privileged to have worked alongside such world class players and managers. Last but defiantly not least, a massive thank you to all the fans who have supported me throughout the years. Love you all. Wishing all of you the best in life.'

The Portuguese goalkeeper was brought in by Jose Mourinho during his first spell as manager as an understudy to Petr Cech.

He played just 39 times in all competition throughout his eight years at the Blues - but was among the celebrations for Premier League, Champions League, Europa League, FA Cup and League Cup triumphs.

Understudy: Jose Mourinho signed Hilario as back-up for Petr Cech in May 2006

Magic moments: Hilario's debut for the Chelsea came in a 1-0 win over Barcelona in the Champions League group stage in 2006 - but he would only feature 38 more times over the next eight years for the Blues
