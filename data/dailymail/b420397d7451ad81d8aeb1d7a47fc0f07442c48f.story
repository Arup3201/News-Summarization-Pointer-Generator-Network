While English people have been voted the best travel companions in Europe by our younger continental neighbours, it is the Germans who have come out top as the most popular on holiday.

Researchers found that people from European countries aged between 16 and 24 would prefer to meet English people when travelling more than any other nationality.

But overall the Germans were found to be the people other Europeans would most like to meet when on holiday, with 37 per cent of people voting our North European neighbours the people they'd most like to hang out with.

Most popular: The Germans have been voted overall as the most popular nationality to meet while on holiday

In
 response to the question, 'Who do you like to meet while travelling?' -
 with the option for selecting multiple nationalities - the poll found 
that the English were voted for by 35 per cent, closely followed by the French (33 per cent), 
and Spanish (33 per cent).

Least popular were Austrians (24 per cent), Belgians (23 per cent), and Portuguese (19 per cent).

The large-scale poll involved people from England, Ireland, Scotland, Germany, France and Spain on their opinions and notions about other nationalities that they encounter in a travelling context.

Researchers said one reason why the English are seen as good travel buddies could be because our language is the language of travel.

'English people in general are respectful and well educated; add to that the fact that English is now the international travel language, and you have a great mix for friendliness,' said Robin Wilfert, creative director of GoEuro

Not a single respondent aged between 25 and 34, including Scots themselves, voted for the Scots as best hosts or guests, found the research

The research from GoEuro, a website and app that helps plan travel across the continent, also uncovered who were seen as the best hosts and guests.

The poll posed the questions 'Who are the best hosts?' and 'Who are the best guests?'

People were allowed to pick one country only, with the majority selecting the Spanish (17 per cent) and Italians (16 per cent) as preferred hosts, while the Germans (16 per cent) were voted the favourite nationality to have as a guest.

One in 11 Europeans (nine per cent) voted English people as the best hosts and the same amount said they were the best guests - making them the joint fifth best hosts with the Germans, and the joint sixth best guests with the Italians.

Smaller countries tended to receive fewer votes but the researchers said it was in part a consequence of their population sizes - meaning correspondingly limited opportunities for significant interaction on the part of their fellow Europeans.

Researchers said the Scottish results were 'emphatic' when subdivided according to age of respondents - they said not a single respondent aged between 25 and 34, including Scots themselves, voted for the Scots as 'best hosts' and no respondents in either the 18 to 24, or 55-64, age categories, including Scots themselves, selected Scots as 'best guests.'

Simon Wisdom, country manager UK at GoEuro, said: "The survey results give us interesting insights into attitudes towards different nationalities in a holiday or travelling context, with participants basing their results on both direct experience and national historical reputation."
