A teenage gunman brought terror to a California high school today after he shot a fellow student before being talked down by a heroic teacher.

The shooting is the first at a school since the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut less than one month ago.

The shooter, who was carrying up to 20 rounds of ammunition for his 12-gauge shotgun, fired at a second student but missed before a teacher persuaded him to lay down his weapon.

The name of the victim has not been 
released, but he is said to be in critical condition after having 
surgery for a shotgun wound to the shoulder.

Injured: One student at Taft Union High School in Taft, California was shot in the shoulder and airlifted to a nearby hospital after another student armed with a shotgun aimed for him

Anxious: Concerned parents rushed to the school shortly after the shooter was detained around 9.20am Thursday

‘When (the teacher) started a dialogue the shotgun was pointed in a lot of different directions,’ Sheriff Donny Youngblood said at a Thursday afternoon press conference.

As the teacher was trying to urge students to exit through a back door to the classroom, a community supervisor arrived on the scene and helped calm the shooter before he was detained by police.

‘As the dialogue started with him and the campus supervisor, the student was still armed with the shotgun... they distracted him,’ Mr Youngblood said.

Damage: Two other students reportedly suffered minor injuries in the race to get out of the building, with this girl being transported to hospital after having hearing damage from being so close to the shooter

‘The heroics of these two people- it goes without saying... speaks volumes for these two young men and what they could have prevented.’

None of the individuals directly involved have been named, but only one person sustained serious injuries from the incident.

The teacher refused medical attention on the scene even though he was struck in the head by a pellet from the shotgun.

During the complicated process of exiting the school, one student sustained minor injuries and another had to go to a hospital because she allegedly was standing near the shooter and may have hearing problems as a result.

Official word: Taft Police Chief Ed Whiting talked to the parents who came to the school after the shooting started in the Taft Union High School science building around 9am on Thursday

Emergency response: Local and federal officials immediately responded to the shooting and went room by room to inspect the school after they apprehended the suspect

Many students in the building immediately called 911 or their parents as soon as they heard shots fired around 9am, so the police response was extremely quick. The sheriff said that two emergency units were on the scene within one minute of the calls.

After the teacher talked the shooter down, he was taken into custody by police. Upon interrogation, he said he told the teacher ‘I don’t want to shoot you’ and proceeded to say the name of the student that he did want to shoot.

The victim has not been officially named but his friends have been tweeting about his condition throughout the course of the day.

Like many other schools across the country, Taft Union High School was rocked by the events of December 14, when a shooter killed 20 young children and six adults before killing himself at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

In light of that, Taft officials went over the emergency response plan and evacuation routes just this morning hours before the shooting.

Response: The sheriff said that two units responded to the scene within one minute of the first emergency calls and local, state and federal officials kept the scene on lock down throughout the afternoon

Comfort: A number of schools- including a middle school and a community college- are all located near the science building where the shooting took place and students from all of those schools were alerted

Waiting for word: Parents gather outside of Taft Union High School while they wait to collect their children from the scene of the latest school shooting

The shooter was meant to be in the science classroom where he opened fire but did not come to school on time.

Instead he went into the building half-way through the class armed with a shotgun and began to fire.

At that time, the school bell had just rung at a nearby school and the principal told students to get inside over the intercom.

A number of students at the California 
school called 911 and their parents on their cell phones from inside the
school once they heard the sound of the gunshot.

One girl called 911 then called her 
mother saying that she was in the classroom where the student had been 
shot and that the victim was lying on the ground in a pool of blood.

'My
friend's been shot,  the teacher's been shot- I don't know what to do,'
the girl reportedly said to her mother on her cell phone.

A friend of the injured student tweeted that the victim had to go into surgery after being hit in the shoulder with a shotgun.

The
victim, thought to be a male student in his junior year at the school, 
sustained injuries to his liver, lung and diaphragm due to the direction
of the bullet.

Lining up: Anxious parents get ready to pick up their students at Taft High School as well as a neighboring middle school

Waiting for answers: A crowd of either students or parents gathers with police inside a back gate of the school following the shooting earlier in the day

Securing the grounds: Police in bullet-proof vests are seen leaving the science building where the shooting took place

A local reporter said that he had spoken
with seven different parents who said that the shooter was suspended 
last year for having a 'hit list' of students that he wanted to hurt or 
kill, though officials have refused to comment as they do not yet know 
all of the facts in the case.

Buzzfeed reports that a student admitted to falsely warning of a school shooting at Taft Union High School in December.

It
is unclear if that student had anything to do with today's shooting, 
but when questioned by police in December he admitted that his threat 
was false.

The local ABC affiliate received two 
separate calls from people who were hiding in closets during the 
incident, and the shooter- who is believed to be a student at the 
school- was taken into custody by police at around 9.20am.

The
shooting took place in the physical sciences building on campus, and 
the West Kern Water District building was put on lock-down as a 
precaution because it is located right next to the school, according to Bakersfield Californian.

Medical attention: The one seriously injured student was airlifted by helicopter to a local hospital

On the ground: Republican congressman Kevin McCarthy was at the school leading up to the press conference

As of 11am, officials from the Kern County Sheriff's Department were still checking each room in the school.

During the afternoon press conference, Sheriff Youngblood said that the school regularly has an armed policeman on campus as a security precaution, but the police officer was running late to school today because he was snowed in.

The
public school is located in the small town of Taft which is about an 
hour's drive outside of Bakersfield in southern California.

The nearby middle school- Lincoln Junior High School- was shut down as a warning when the shooting at Taft Union School was reported.

Felicity Reich, 13, said that her teachers told all of the students that a shooting had taken place at the high school.

'They were all trying to keep each other happy and not flip out,' she said of students trying to keep one another calm.

Latest incident: Taft Union High School was the scene of a school shooting on Thursday morning and initial reports said that two people were injured but only one needed medical attention

Shooting: Two people were reported as being shot at Taft Union High School outside of Bakersfield in California

Republican congressman Kevin McCarthy
was quick to release his condolences over Twitter, saying: 'I am deeply
saddened and troubled by news of the shooting. Judy and I offer our 
prayers to the victims, their families and the entire Taft community.'

He was present on the scene shortly after the shooting along with all relevant local officials.

'All the 
resources one can possibly imagine to respond to a horrible tragedy are 
here,' Taft City Councilman Dave Noerr told the Bakersfield Californian 
after arriving at the scene.

'This is a small community. We're one big family.

'We're doing everything we can for each other.'

The school was originally opened in 1912 and one of it's 
biggest claims to fame was that it was featured in a 1986 film starring 
Robin Williams and Kurt Russell called The Best of Times.

The shooting comes just less than a month since the horrific shooting took place at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut that left 20 children dead along with six adult educators.
