When professional diver Michal Navratil was a boy he dreamed he could fly like his favourite cartoon hero Superman.

So when the 28-year-old took part in the High Diving World Championships in Barcelona, Spain, in a Superman costume and plummeted 88.6ft, it was a childhood dream come true.

The stunt was captured on camera and has become an internet hit.

'When I was a kid it was my favorite superhero,' the Czech told Esquire.

'Then when I was 15 and I went to a diving event near Prague, one of my friends told me: why don't you do something like a Superman pose?

'So it started as a joke between us but I always kept it as something fun and then started to do it higher and higher.' 

Navratil, who came fourth in the competition, started diving when he was 18, first doing a somersalt from twenty metres.

He took part in his first competition in Amalfi, Italy, five years later. 

According to Navratil, with every metre you go higher, the harder the impact on your body.

When he is not diving from such great heights, Navratil works on a cruise 
ship in the Royal Caribbean as a high diver and is also a stuntman.

Before jumping, he likes to get the adrenaline pumping by doing a number of stretches and exercises.

Navratil plans to try and move up the rankings by performing his biggest jump to date which will consist of three backwards somersaults with three twists which he hopes to have perfected in time for next year.
