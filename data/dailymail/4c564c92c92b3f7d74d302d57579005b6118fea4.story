A clifftop mansion was demolished yesterday before its new owner could move in because large parts of the property had fallen into the sea.

Ridgemont House, which is perched on the top of Oddicombe Cliffs in Torquay, Devon, seemed like a bargain when it was sold for just £154,000 at a blind auction in 2010.

But its value plunged dramatically before telephone bidder Sue Diamond had the chance to live in it when constant landslides and erosion rendered it uninhabitable.

Fallen away: Demolition work gets underway on Torquay's world-famous clifftop property, Ridgemont House

Dangerous: The property has become uninhabitable as clifftop erosion has brought it closer and closer to the edge of Oddiscombe Cliffs

Retired policewoman Sue bought the property in 2010 without having a survey completed despite its proximity to the rapidly-eroding cliff-face.

Since then the condemned 1930s house has slowly collapsed - room by room - onto the beach 150ft below.

Torbay Council sent in demolition teams yesterday to start pulling down the last remains of the crumbling structure from the 1930s. The workman were forced to used a crane to gain access to the ruins amid fears the ground could give way.

Local resident Don Proctor said: 'They started taking the roof off first, then the windows and the doors. It's such a shame as it was a magnificent property back in its day.

'There's one hell of a crack in the walls - the rest could literally go at any moment.'

Set
in one of the most expensive areas of the so-called English Riviera, 
Ridgemont House would have been worth £400,000 had it been situated 100 
yards or so further inland.

Neighbouring
homeowners have also seen the price of their homes plummet, with one, 
Tor Cottage, recently selling for just £33,500 - about a tenth of 
what it would be expected to sell for elsewhere.

Sale: Sue Diamond bought the property in 2010 without having a survey done, despite its proximity to the rapidly-eroding cliff-face

Tearing apart: Workers were forced to access the house by crane because of fears the ground could give way

Rubble: Part of the roof had been ripped away and only half of the house's front was left standing

Heavy machinery: Torbay Council is behind the demolition work, although the owner of the house will have to foot the bill, which will run into thousands of pounds

Miss Diamond, 59, tried to sue the builder from whom she bought Ridgemont House in February 2010.

But a judge ordered her to pay what she owed because the auctioneers had warned buyers it was severely structurally damaged and might be beyond economic repair.

The property could land its owner with yet another hefty bill after Torbay Council said it would be looking to claw back the cost of the demolition.

The local authority send in contractors when a deadline passed for Ridgemont House to be pulled down privately.

A spokesman said: 'We have appointed contractors to demolish the property and we will be looking to reclaim the cost of the demolition in due course.'
