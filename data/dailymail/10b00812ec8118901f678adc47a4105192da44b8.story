Hidden information: Lord Justice Treacy call for names of those arrested by police to be kept secret

Two senior judges yesterday called for secret arrests where the public would lose the right to know who the police detain.

They said this is necessary because when an arrest is publicised it causes ‘irremediable damage to the person’s reputation’.

The demand for draconian rules – made 
on behalf of the entire judiciary – raises the spectre of a legal regime
under which the targets of police raids could be seized and questioned 
while the public are kept in the dark.

Even families and friends would 
be held in ignorance and unable to help.

Free speech campaigners condemned the call as ‘very dangerous’ with the potential for ‘great harm’.

Earlier this week it was revealed that
the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) is drawing up plans 
meant to apply across the country to prevent police forces from 
releasing the names of those they arrest.

The latest intervention was made by 
two senior figures, Lord Justice Treacy and Mr Justice Tugendhat. Lord 
Justice Treacy presided in 2010 over the first serious criminal trial in
350 years to go ahead without a jury.

The trial of four armed robbers 
sentenced to a total of 64 years in jail was excepted from usual 
democratic rules because of fears over jury-nobbling.

Mr Justice Tugendhat is the most 
senior High Court judge dealing with libel and media law.

The judges 
said they backed the conclusion of Lord Justice Leveson in his report on
press ethics that only in exceptional circumstances should details of 
those arrested or suspected of crime be made known to the public.

They said police must consider the 
human right to privacy and added: ‘The police arrest many people who are
never charged.

'If there were a policy that the police should 
consistently publish the fact that a person has been arrested, in many 
cases that information would attract substantial publicity, causing 
irremediable damage to the person’s reputation.

‘Even if the fact that the person was 
not charged were subsequently published, that would not receive the same
publicity, and would not prevent subsequent internet searches 
disclosing that the person had been arrested.’

In the dark: Mr Justice Tugendhat argue that when an arrest is publicised it causes 'irremediable damage to the person's reputation' and should therefore be kept from public knowledge

The two judges said they were speaking
‘on the basis of the judiciary’s interest in the effective 
administration of justice’.

They said their opinion reflected the views 
of various judges including the President of the Queen’s Bench Division 
Sir John Thomas, whose courts deal with libel, the Senior Presiding 
Judge Lord Justice Gross and Lord Justice Leveson.

They added: ‘It has not been possible,
however, to consult all relevant judges.’ Among a number of senior 
figures missed out of their consultations appear to be the Lord Chief 
Justice Lord Judge, the most senior judge in England and Wales, who is 
on record as a strong supporter of freedom of expression.

'The police arrest many people who are never charged.

If there were a policy that the police should consistently publish the fact that a person has been arrested, in many cases that information would attract substantial publicity, causing irremediable damage to the person’s reputation.

Even if the fact that the person  was not charged were subsequently published, that would not receive the same publicity, and would not prevent subsequent internet searches disclosing  that the person had been arrested.

We adopt the words of Leveson LJ in his report: ‘‘The current guidance in this area needs to be strengthened.

For example, I think that it should be made abundantly clear that save in exceptional and clearly defined circumstances (for example, where there may be a risk to the public), the names or identifying details of those who are arrested or suspected of a crime should not  be released to the press nor  the public.’

The judicial paper was produced as a 
response to the Law Commission, the Government’s law reform quango, 
which recommended last year that the Home Office and ACPO should develop
a national system under which ‘the names of arrestees will be released 
but that appropriate safeguards will need to be put in place’.

The judges replied that the law should
‘protect the rights of suspects, defendants and witnesses, in 
particular their rights to reputation and privacy’.

They also raised the prospect of a new law which would allow those arrested and named in public to sue for compensation.

‘It may be that the civil law should 
be reformed to give a remedy for the publication of prejudicial 
information, in addition to the law of contempt,’ the two judges said.

They said exceptions to secret arrests would be ‘only in exceptional and
clearly defined circumstances’, for example when there is an immediate 
risk to the public.

The move by the judges produced alarm 
among freedom of speech campaigners. Kirsty Hughes of Index on 
Censorship said: ‘There are of course circumstances where it may be 
better not to release the names of people who are arrested.

‘But to set this up as a norm could 
prove very dangerous. The actions of the police must operate under the 
principle of open justice, and this includes arrest. The introduction of
de facto secret arrests has potential for great harm.’

Earlier this 
week David Ormerod QC, the author of the Law Commission’s report, said 
that ‘it is imperative that we have confidence that our legal process is
transparent.’ He added that it was ‘not hard to imagine cases of clear 
public interest in which arrests should be reported’.

But ACPO said that police chiefs were 
looking to protect the public in line with Lord Justice Leveson’s 
recommendations, and that under its new rules there will ‘most likely be
exceptions in the interests of justice and to prevent and detect 
crime’.

Opponents of secret arrests say the 
suppression of information means that witnesses or other victims of a 
criminal will not come forward.
