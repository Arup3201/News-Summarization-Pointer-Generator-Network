A paedophile doctor went on a church mission to an African orphanage ten days before he abused two young cancer patients.

Myles Bradbury, 41, was part of a 15-strong group that went to Swaziland to help orphaned children in 2012.

He travelled with the KingsGate Christian Evangelical Church from Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, to help children whose parents had died from Aids.

The trip came at the same time that Bradbury was abusing vulnerable boys at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.

He was arrested in December last year and is to be sentenced after he admitted abusing 18 boys in his care between 2009 and 2013.

Police said they had no evidence to suggest Bradbury offended on the trip to Bulembu but others on the team confirmed he was left alone with the orphans.

Each volunteer was allowed to be alone with up to six children in the afternoons for two to three hours, they said.

A spokesman for the KingsGate Church said: 'We are shocked and deeply saddened at the actions of Dr Myles Bradbury and at the devastating impact that these have had on the lives of many.

'As soon as the charges against him were revealed in early July 2014 we promptly contacted Bulembu.

'Bulembu then instituted a detailed investigation to make sure that he had not had any one-to-one contact with children during that time.

'They found no evidence that he had any unsupervised involvement with children and was always accompanied by community development project staff.'

Bradbury used tiny video cameras hidden in pens to film himself abusing young cancer patients, it emerged earlier this month.

Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge suspended him after a child's parents complained about an 'intimate examination'.

Police traced Bradbury's rubbish and unearthed a laptop but the memory inside had been removed, and with it potential evidence of further offences.

However a disc containing 16,000 images of child abuse and two specially adapted spy pens were found in a garden annexe.

Each had a small camera above the clip. Footage was downloaded by plugging it into a computer.

A two-day sentencing hearing of Bradbury, from Herringswell, Suffolk, will begin tomorrow and is due to conclude on Monday.

Mistakes by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) meant Bradbury was left free for 16 months to wage his campaign of abuse.

The doctor bought a DVD in 2005 from Azov Films in Canada. The company advertised on its website ‘just legal’ and ‘naturist’ films but many were clearly illegal - and were bought by paedophiles in over 50 countries around the world.

The site was finally closed down by Toronto police in the summer of 2012 and concerned officers in Canada soon dispatched the names of its customers to authorities in other countries in an operation called Project Spade.

CEOP was handed a list of 2,235 suspected British paedophiles in July 2012 by Canadian police - but did nothing for months.

It was only when the centre was absorbed by the National Crime Agency last November that Bradbury's name was passed to Suffolk police and his home was raided.

In the intervening time he had continued his abuse and made his trip to the African orphanage.

Among the other suspects named on the list handed over by Canadian authorities was that of teacher Martin Goldberg, who was found dead a day after police first contacted him.

Following the 46-year-old's death, a search of his house in Shoeburyness, Essex was conducted and 7,257 indecent images of children that he had downloaded from the internet were found.

Three police forces in Britain - Essex, North Yorkshire and North Wales - are under investigation for allegedly failing to act on the child porn intelligence, it emerged earlier this month.
