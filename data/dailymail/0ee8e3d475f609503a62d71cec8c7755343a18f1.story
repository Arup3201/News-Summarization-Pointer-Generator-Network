Daniel Craig and Benicio Del Torro star alongside President Obama in a new White House campaign to raise awareness about sexual assault.

The Obama administration posted the Public Service Announcement, which is part of its '1 is 2 Many' campaign, on YouTube this week.

The one-minute video also features actors Steve Carell, Seth Meyers and Dule Hill, alongside Vice President Joe Biden. 

The initiative is designed to encourage men to speak up and step in if they see someone in danger of being sexually assaulted.

President Obama in the new White House campaign to raise awareness about sexual assault. 'It's up to all of us to put an end to sexual assault and that starts with you, says Obama in the video montage

During the video Benicio Del Toro tells viewers: 'If she doesn't consent, or if she can't consent, it's rape, it's assault'

James Bond star Daniel Craig says: 'If saw it happening, I'd never blame her, I'd help her'

The clip's release coincides with 
Vice President Biden's big speech on the subject, and with the formal 
unveiling of the first report from the White House Task Force to Protect
 Students From Sexual Assault.

'It’s up to all of us to put an end to sexual assault and that starts with you, says President Obama in the video montage

During the video Del Toro tells viewers: 'If she doesn't consent, or if she can't consent, it's rape, it's assault.'

And Craig adds: 'If saw it happening, I'd never blame her, I'd help her.'

The White House is pressuring colleges and universities to improve their handling of cases of rape and sexual assault.

Steve Carell says in the video montage which has been posted on YouTube: 'It's a crime. It's wrong'

Seth Myers was also perosnally called by Vice President Joe Biden to star in the campaign

While 1 in 5 female 
students is assaulted, the White House said the review was also about 
protecting male victims and engaging men in discussions about preventing
 such assaults.

Research has shown that most campus sexual assault 
victims know their attackers, alcohol or drugs are often involved and 
only 12 percent of college women attacked report it to police

Speaking about the release Dulé Hill said: 'One sexual assault is one too many. My desire for this PSA
 is that it will heighten awareness and in turn be a catalyst for more 
prevention.'

Biden said that he personally  asked the actors to participate in the video.

'I’m not used to making calls to big old movie stars,' he said. 'But I called them. And every one of them said immediately, ‘What can I do?’'

'The message is clear and simple; everyone has a responsibility,' said Daniel Craig in a statement released by The White House.

Actor Dule Hill says: 'It's happening in college campuses, at bars, at parties, even high schools'

Biden said that in the neighborhood where he came from, 'if a man raised his hand to a woman you had the job to kick the crap out of him'

'There are no exceptions. There are no excuses.  Please watch it and pass it on.' .

Del Toro added: 'The PSA also encourages any witness to such acts to speak up, do the right thing, and be a hero. It is about protecting and respecting our loved ones--our mothers, sisters, daughters, wives, and girlfriends.'

A White House task force on sexual assault recommended actions Tuesday that colleges and universities should take to protect victims and inform the public about the magnitude of the problem, such as identifying confidential victim's advocates and conducting surveys to better gauge the frequency of sexual assault on their campuses.

The recommendations stem from a 90-day review by the task force that President Barack Obama created after his administration heard complaints about the poor treatment of campus rape victims and the hidden nature of such crimes.

The task force also promised greater transparency.

A new website, notalone.gov, will post enforcement actions and offers information to victims about how to seek local help and information about filing a complaint.

'Colleges and universities can no longer turn a blind eye or pretend that rape and sexual assault doesn't occur on their campus,' Vice President Joe Biden said in announcing the results of the task force's work.

The PSA will air in movie theaters and lobbies and on military installations and ships from next month.
