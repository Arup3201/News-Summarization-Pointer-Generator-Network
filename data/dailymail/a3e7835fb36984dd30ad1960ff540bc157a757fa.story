A winter storm dumped several inches of wet, heavy snow on parts of the eastern United States on Monday, snarling commutes and Super Bowl fans' trips home, closing schools and government offices, cutting power and delaying or canceling more than 7,000 flights across the country.

Fat flakes fell in Philadelphia and New York, creating slushy sidewalks and streets and all but erasing all memory of Sunday's temperatures in the 50s. The storm began moving out of the region Monday afternoon, making way for another system expected to sweep in from the Plains with ice and snow late Tuesday and early Wednesday.

The National Weather Service reported about 8 inches of snow near Frostburg, Md., while parts of southern Ohio and West Virginia got about 10 inches. Totals in the Philadelphia area ranged from 3 to 9 inches; New York saw as much as 7 inches by 3 p.m.

Mess: More than 7,000 flights were delayed or cancelled Monday due to a brutal winter storm that left several inches of snow across the East Coast

Risky: Even after being de-iced, several airlines decided that flying in the storm would be too risky

LaGuardia: New York City was hit with up to nine inches of snow in some areas, including LaGuardia Airport in Queens

Government offices, courts and schools closed in parts of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and scattered power outages were reported throughout the region. Speed limits were reduced on many major highways.

In New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie declared a state of emergency with travel conditions hazardous. Nonessential government employees were dismissed early.

By late afternoon, the flight-tracking website FlightAware reported more than 4,300 delayed flights and 1,900 canceled flights nationwide in cities including Philadelphia, Newark, N.J., and New York. Inbound flights to those airports were delayed one to three hours because of snow and ice.

Russ Louderback, of Fishers, Ind., and his 11-year-old son Mason had gone to New Jersey to see the Super Bowl but suffered a triple whammy of bad luck: Their beloved Denver Broncos lost, they got stuck in an hours-long traffic jam leaving the stadium and their Monday afternoon flight home was canceled.

'It was so congested we couldn't get out of New Jersey, even though we left early because our team lost,' said Louderback, a hotel executive.

Delayed: The flights that weren't cancelled due to snow were delayed, in some cases up to several hours

Super Storm: Many of those in New York to attend the Super Bowl on Sunday were stuck in the airport for hours waiting through flight delays

Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer was among the stranded travelers after her return flight to Phoenix was canceled Monday, a spokesman said. Brewer attended the big game as part of the ceremonial handoff of hosting duties; next year's Super Bowl is in Glendale, Ariz.

Francois Emond, of Alma, Quebec, arrived at Newark Airport at 6 a.m. Monday to find his flight home had been canceled. Wearing a Seattle Seahawks championship hat and an ear-to-ear smile, he said he didn't care about the cancellation or the weather in light of Seattle's victory. He planned to spend an extra night at his hotel in New York.

'The night will be very short,' Emond said. 'When you win a Super Bowl for the first time, the night is very, very short.'

In Connecticut, architect Frank Emery described messy conditions outside as he stopped at a coffee shop in New Haven.

'A lot of people must have called in sick after the Super Bowl,' he said. 'It's not cleaned up as well as usual.'

In Philadelphia, the airport experienced weather delays as long as four hours Monday morning. But the flight home for Seahawks fan George Shiley, of Snohomish, Wash., remained on schedule at midday.

Shiley, a Seattle season ticket holder, had won a lottery for Super Bowl tickets. He and his buddy stayed in Philadelphia, about 85 miles southwest of the East Rutherford, N.J., stadium.

'It's been a great trip. I joked that `It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia' - and it was, until today,' said Shiley, referring to the FX sitcom.

At least two deaths and one serious injury were blamed on the storm. In western Kentucky, where the snow began falling Sunday, a man died that night when his car skidded into a snowplow. On Monday, a New York City man was fatally struck by a backhoe that was moving snow.

A 10-year-old girl was in serious condition after she was impaled by a metal rod while sledding north of Baltimore.

Another storm is likely to hit the region beginning Tuesday night, bringing a combination of rain, freezing rain and snow, said Gary Szatkowski, a weather service meteorologist in Mount Holly, N.J.

Perhaps residents shouldn't be surprised, considering groundhog Punxsutawney Phil on Sunday predicted six more weeks of winter.

There's also a possibility for a storm this weekend, Szatkowski said.

'I like to say Punxsutawney Phil agrees with me,' he said. 'Winter's not over, that's for sure.'

The second storm is expected to reach

 St Louis with heavy snow.

Snow,
 freezing rain and sleet is also expected to hit north and west of 
Washington and Baltimore on Tuesday, the Weather Channel reported, 
before turning to rain into Wednesday.

Snow will also blanket western, central 
and Upstate New York and New England, covering Buffalo, Albany, 
Burlington, Boston and Portland, Maine.

Nebraska, Kansas, Illinois, Indiana 
and Michigan could also get six or more inches of snow between Tuesday 
and Wednesday, according to The Weather Channel, NBC reported.

Snow
 will later reach the Ohio Valley, central Appalachians and northwest 
Texas, where winter weather advisories are already in place due to the 
threat of freezing rain.

From
 Tuesday, the ice could also spark power outages in western 
Pennsylvania, western Maryland, northwest Virginia and eastern West 
Virginia.

Then the third winter storm is expected to hit the Rockies on Friday.

'We
 don’t know the orientation or the path of the storm,' Walton said. 
'There will likely be high impacts from the Midwest into the Northeast 
and perhaps even the south Saturday and Sunday.'

It comes just days after Atlanta was brought to a grinding halt by the snow to the South.
