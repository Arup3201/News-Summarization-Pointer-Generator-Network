Fire officials said Darryl Ferguson (pictured during previous arrest), 55, confessed to causing a blaze at an Islamic institute in Houston

A homeless man has been arrested and charged with arson for a fire that destroyed a building at an Islamic institute in Houston, fire officials said on Monday.

The blaze early on Friday at the Quba Islamic Institute destroyed one of three buildings there, but no one was injured.

Fire officials said Darryl Ferguson, 55, confessed to causing the blaze – but he claimed it was an accident as he was led away by officials, according to a Houston news website.

Ferguson had been staying in the area and was considered a suspect by investigators.

They were looking for him on Monday when he apparently approached them on his bicycle.

Ruben Hernandez, from the Houston Fire Department’s arson squad, told Chron.com: ‘We asked if he wanted to talk to us in our office. Mr Ferguson made an admission.’

Ferguson has been linked to a number of crimes in the past, including credit card abuse, trespassing, possession of a controlled substance, prostitution and assault.

Authorities said that someone used an accelerant in the 5am Friday blaze, according to one of the imam's sons, 25-year-old Ahsan Zahid.

Mr Zahid said that an investigator told him that the incident was a suspected arson, and that the fire was not an accident.

On Friday, the Houston Fire Department (HFD) said in a release it was investigating and could not yet name the cause of the fire.

Earlier Twitter users had directed their fury at a Texas man who allegedly said on social media that the center should burn down.

According to The Daily Kos Herron wrote on social media ‘let it burn… block the fire hydrant’.

The Daily Kos reported that Herron is a Crystal Beach Volunteer Fire Department (CBVFD) volunteer.

A LinkedIn profile lists a man of the same name as working for the fire department and Herron's own Facebook profile features him in front of a fire truck dressed in overalls.

However, CBVFD said in a statement sent to Daily Mail Online early Monday that Herron is not affiliated with the organization whatsoever.

The statement said 'There have been recent post on social media from someone stating they are a member of our Fire Department and have posted hate messages against the Islamic Community.

'Please know that this person, Dustin Herron, is not a member of the Crystal Beach Volunteer Fire Dept; nor has he ever been a member of our fire department.

'We are in the process of trying to track down Mr. Herron regarding the comments he made. We have also notified the Galveston County Sheriff Dept. regarding Mr Herron falsely stating he is a fire fighter within our organization.

Uproar: Herron allegedly posted this message on social media. Daily Mail Online could not independently confirm the authenticity of the post

'We have received many e-mails regarding his recent social media post and comments.

'Please know that our Volunteer's give 100% effort 100% of the time.'

One tweet against Herron asked him 'why the hate? Serve and protect? Or just hate?'

Another said 'you are an embarrassment to all public safety officials and volunteers, what you posted about the Islamic center is shameful!'

Both Herron and a spokesman for the Galveston County Sheriff's Office (GCSO) did not immediately return requests for comment early Monday from Daily Mail Online.

The FBI said Saturday that they are monitoring the situation and could take a more active role in the investigation, according to Reuters.

The Council on American Islamic Relations's Texas office has called for possible hate crime motivations to be looked at in the investigation.

Federal agencies are expected to become more involved if that is the case.

No injuries were reported in the fire, which largely took place in a storage building and is thought to have caused $100,000 in damage.

The contents of the building, which housed the institute's computers, lights and equipment for a renovation, were completely destroyed.

Authorities said the blaze started at 5am and caused an expected $100,000 worth of damage before firefighters were able to put it out, according to one of the imam's sons, 25-year-old Ahsan Zahid

The Houston Fire Department is still investigating the cause of the fire, though they reportedly told Mr Zahid that it did not start by accident

The center has a place to pray, holds community events, offers Arabic classes and also runs a Sunday School.

The Quba Islamic Institute is asking for donations through their website qubahouston.org, and Zahid told Daily Mail Online that they had raised $2,500 as of Saturday afternoon.

The institute said a man had driven past the institute and mockingly yelled 'Allah' on Thursday.

A man with a covered face was chased away from the building earlier in the week.

The Muslim center had been scheduled to host a talk by a former Guantanamo Bay guard who converted to Islam after the experience, Terry Holdbrooks, on Friday night.

Zahid said that the event took place despite the fire and that 'all programs, activities, and prayers have, and will continue as scheduled'.

The Islamic Institute used its Facebook page to reach out for donations and ask for tolerance in the wake of the fire, but their posts soon saw an influx of anti-Muslim commenters

Two suspicious incidents happened in the week leading up to the fire, including a man with a covered face who had to be chased away from the building

The center's Facebook account responded to abuse on Facebook by thanking offensive users for their perspective

The institute's Facebook page has also come under attack from posters who have insulted Islam repeatedly on posts where the center is explaining what happened in the fire.

The institute has defended itself against the Islamophobic posts by thanking the users for their perspective and urging tolerance.

The possible hate crime follows on the death of three Muslim students in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, that federal investigators are looking into for motives of religious hatred.

Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23; his wife, Yusor Mohammad Abu-Salha, 21, and her sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, were buried Thursday.

The annual Texas Muslim Capitol Day in Austin was targeted by anti-Islam protesters last month, the Los Angeles Times reported.

In 2011 the Houston Fire Department said that someone had deliberately set fire to a mosque on the other side of the city.
