Gwyneth Paltrow is a very, very busy woman, but she always makes time for her fans.

This month, in between consciously uncoupling from husband of 11 years Chris Martin, the actress/mother/model/chef/lifestyle guru has managed to find time to scour her home town of LA for all the hotspots that we might want to visit.

Her latest Goop newsletter features a guide to the place that she calls home offering advice and recommendations to hipsters, kids, the health-conscious (of course), architecture fans and her New York pals with a 'classic' section.

Gwyneth Paltrow has published a guide to LA and a night at the £500-a-night Beverly Hills Hotel is top of her 'to do' list for out-of-towners

Introducing her guide to the glitzy Californian city she says: 'We live to source, scour, dine, and meander our way to the leanest and best info for you.'

And by lean we assume that she's not talking about her bank account because the tips include a four-figured Sushi restaurant bill, £300 museum tours and seriously high-end designer shopping.

But there are lots of bargains to be found too, and the list is certainly very comprehensive if you are planning on visiting the West Coast soon.

Gwyneth says: 'People may laugh at L.A.'s juice-cleansing, namasté-ing, ways, but the thrilling reality of sunny, 75-degree days is no joke.'

Of course we don't look to the shiny, macrobiotic, jet-setting, millionaire superstar for practical tips on life. So here are some of our favourite LA travel tips fresh from planet Gwyneth..

SLEEPING & EATING

A night at Marilyn Monroe's beloved BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL, where prices start at £500 a night and finish
 at somewhere your bank manager won't even want to think about, is top of Gwyneth's to do list for out-of-towners.

Food-wise you should brace yourself as many of the eateries recommended by 
the health-loving blonde include the terms 'invariably steep' ' sticker shock' and 'pricey but 
worth it'.

URASAWA on Rodeo Drive is famous for being one of America's most expensive restaurants where sushi master Urasawa, one of best sushi chefs in the world, spends two days crafting each meal and only lets 11 people sit at any one time.

Gwyneth says: 'Depending on your order and sake consumption you can expect to spend 
about 1K per person' but claims that it is worth it because of the exquisite wagyu beef and caviar gilded with gold.

She also, surprisingly, recommends paparazzi hotspot THE IVY restaurant for people-watching from the patio over a shrimp salad, although admits it is 'overly touristy'

At the cheaper end of the spectrum one of her hangouts is Tex-Mex joint BAR AMA which 
offers the best brussel sprouts in the city (sprouts are a 'thing' in LA right now) washed down with tequila cocktails.

And the famously fastidious foodie also raves about the dairy-free pizzas at MOHAWK BLEND on Sunset Bouleavard, or for picky little eaters a mini 'protein plate' for kids featuring cucumber and cheese (and definitely no carbs) at BLUE PLATE on Montana Avenue.

SHOPPING & DOING

The list of boutiques that the style icon frequents for herself include OPENING CEREMONY, BEATRICE VALENZUELA and CURVE, all featuring fabulous labels and far-out price tags.

But as a mother-of-two Gwyneth no doubt also spends a lot of time shopping for children's clothes. While the retail therapy options in LA are huge, the 41-year-old highlights tweeny boutique UN DEUX TROIS as one of her top spots thanks to its personal styling service for high school fashionistas. Her hot picks for girls this season? Vegan leather leggings and sequined tops.

Staying on the vegan tip, she also recommends ZULU TATTOO, an 'unintimidating' parlour that offers vegan and eco-friendly inking and promises to bring out the your own sacred marking.

In her down time it seems that Gwynnie likes to spend afternoons in the HOLLYWOOD FOREVER CEMETERY, not trying to contact deceased superstars you understand, but instead taking in the gigs and screenings they host under the sun.

And finally, to unwind after all that eating, shopping, tattooing and sightseeing she recommends taking the kids to WI SPA, a 24-hour spa ('Convenient if the family are supremely jet-lagged') where they can play in the mineral pools or zone out in the comic book library while mum and dad get a much-needed massage.
