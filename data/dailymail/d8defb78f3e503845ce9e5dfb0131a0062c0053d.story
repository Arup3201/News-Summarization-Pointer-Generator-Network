Mitt Romney has said that former President Bill Clinton 'embarrassed the nation' with the Monica Lewinsky scandal, but doesn't think it will affect Hillary Clinton's likely run for president.

'I think Hillary Clinton, if she becomes a nominee, will have plenty to discuss about her own record,' Romney said on NBC's Meet The Press' on Sunday.

'I don’t imagine that Bill Clinton is going to be a big part of it.'

According to Yahoo News, the former Massachusetts governor and 2012 Republican nominee was asked to comment on the 42nd president in light of the GOP's recent 'resurrection' of the Clinton White House.

Hillary Clinton is capable of standing on her away, away from her husband's sex scandal, if and when she runs for President, Mitt Romney said Sunday

'He embarrassed the nation,' Romney said of Clinton.

'He breached his responsibility, I think, as an adult and as a leader in his relationship. And I think that’s very unfortunate.

'But I don't think that's Hillary Clinton's to explain. She has her own record, her own vision for where she would take the country. 

'And I think that's something which will be debated extensively during the 2016 campaign.'

Bill Clinton's sexual relationship with Lewinsky, who at the time was a 22-year-old White House intern, led to his impeachment in 1998 and subsequent trial.

Clinton was eventually acquitted of the impeachment charges.

Last month, Republican Sen. Rand Paul first raised the issue of the Bill Clinton White House, lashing out at Democrats over pushing the idea of the GOP's 'war on women' while forgiving Clinton for his 'predatory' affair.

'The Democrats, one of their big issues is they have concocted and said Republicans are committing a war on women,' Paul said.

'One of the workplace laws and rules that I think are good is that bosses shouldn't prey on young interns in their office.

'And I think really the media seems to have given President Clinton a pass on this,' the Kentucky senator continued.

Hillary Clinton is expected to enter the 2016 Presidential campaign

'He took advantage of a girl that was 20 years old and an intern in his office.

'There is no excuse for that, and that is predatory behavior, and it should be something we shouldn't want to associate with people who would take advantage of a young girl in his office.

'This isn't having an affair. I mean, this isn't me saying, 'Oh, he's had an affair, we shouldn't talk to him.'

'Someone who takes advantage of a young girl in their office? I mean, really. And then [Democrats] have the gall to stand up and say, 'Republicans are having a war on women'?

'So, yes, I think it's a factor. Now, it's not Hillary's fault. But it is a factor in judging Bill Clinton in history.'

Paul is considered one of several possible candidates for the 2016 GOP nomination.

Former Bush administration adviser has warned the Republican party against a 2016 presidential election strategy that focuses too much on the political history of potential Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton

Romney is not among them.

Romney's comments come as former Bush adminstration adviser Karl Rove cautioned Republicans against focusing their campagn too much on Hilary Clinton.

Rove told Fox News Sunday he was uncertain whether revisiting Clinton and husband Bill Clinton’s years in the White House would help Republicans win the presidency.

'It may,' he said.

'But the trouble for Republicans is it’s easier to say what you’re against than what you are for.'

Republicans have tried to knock down a Clinton candidacy essentially since she resigned from her post in February 2013 as secretary of state.
