Gone: Dr Teleka Patrick disappeared two weeks ago after receiving a suspicious phone call at work

A 30-year-old first-year medical resident has been missing for more than two weeks after receiving a suspicious call the day before she vanished.

Dr Teleka Patrick started her residency at Borgess Medical Center in Kalamazoo, Michigan this year after getting her Ph.D. this spring.

Dr Patrick was reported missing when she didn't show up for work on December 6, and surveillance footage showed her the night before failing to secure a room at a Radisson hotel just five minutes away from her apartment.

According to police, Dr Patrick worked a shift at Borgess on December 5 and had one of her colleagues drive her to the Raddison hotel after work.

Both her purse and cellphone were found left behind at work, and surveillance footage at the hotel shows her trying to get a room with cash, but not having enough money.

In the surveillance footage without audio, Dr Patrick talks calmly with the front desk person for about 15 minutes before leaving after not getting the room.

She is then seen boarding a complimentary hotel shuttle back to her gold Lexus parked at the medical center - the last time anyone say her.

'It was really sad to watch it because this is the last video record of her before she went missing,' Teleka's sister Tenesha Patrick told WWMT.

Just two hours later, Dr Patrick's car was discovered abandoned in a ditch on the wetbound side of 1-94, more than 100 miles away in Portage, Indiana. The keys were missing from the inside of the car.

Dr Patrick was officially reported missing the next day when she didn't show up for work.

One of her collegaues told investigators that she received a phone call that day and that her demeanor changed after she hung up.

'Who was calling her, what was that about, does that have anything to do with her disappearance,' her sister asked.

Her family is currently offering a $10,000 reward for information on her disappearance, and have hired their own private investigator.

'We keep getting closer to Christmas, and it keeps getting further and further away,' Tenesha told ABC News.

Anyone with information on Dr Patrick's disappearance are being asked to call the Indiana State Police at 219-696-6242 or the Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Department at 269-383-8748.
