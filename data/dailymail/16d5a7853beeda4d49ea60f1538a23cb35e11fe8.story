The Olympic Torch today crossed into the Republic of Ireland in a move designed to symbolise progress made by the peace process.

And while decision to take the relay into a country that is not actually playing host to the Games was met with a few raised eyebrows, a few more questions would have been asked when the honour of carrying the flame was handed to two of Ireland's less illustrious celebrities.

Singing twins Jedward - famed more for their haircuts and bad dancing than their voices - were chosen to be among the torchbearers for the prestigious event.

And with their long spikey-blond quiffs the boisterous pair bore more than a passing resemblance to the iconic torch itself.

Their inclusion comes after Olympic bosses were criticised for allowing The Voice’s American judge Will.i.am carry the torch.

Tomorrow the torch continues travelling north through Northern Ireland, beginning in the coastal town of Newcastle at the foot of Slieve Donard bright and early just before 7am, then continuing through Dundrum, Clough, Downpatrick, Crossgar, Saintfield, Ballynahinch and Templepatrick before reaching Antrim at around 11am.

Its journey towards lighting the flame at the London 2012 Games will then continue into the afternoon through Ballyronan, Magherafelt and Ballymena. The parade is scheduled to end in Moorfields at around 3pm.

The brothers lined up alongside the country's sporting legends such as jockey Ruby Walsh, footballer Paul McGrath, and Olympic-winning runners Ronnie Delany and Sonia O'Sullivan for the prestigious event.

In all 41 torchbearers made the historic journey through the city, with thousands of people lining the streets to watch.

X Factor stars Jedward - formerly known as long-distance runners John and Edward Grimes - were greeted with cheers as they made their way down O'Connell Street, Dublin's main thoroughfare, and past some of the city's most famous landmarks.

John said: 'It's such a great experience being here. It was such an honour to carry the Olympic Torch in the relay.

'Thank you, guys, so much for all coming out and being so Jepic and so Jedicated to the Olympics.

'Last year we had Barack Obama and this year we have the Olympic Torch.'

Edward added: 'We're so excited to be here. The Olympic Torch is so symbolic, you better be watching the Olympics. Go, Team Ireland!'

Irish Olympic boxing medallists Wayne McCullough and Michael Carruth took part in an early-morning handover ceremony as the torch crossed the border and travelled to the Republic.

Special permission was granted so the torch could go to the south of Ireland for a historic tour that symbolised the peace process.

Jockey Ruby Walsh, footballer Paul McGrath, and Olympic-winning runners Ronnie Delany and Sonia O'Sullivan were among the sports stars who took part in the relay and a ceremony in St Stephen's Green.

Rachel O'Neill, nine, from Churchtown in Dublin, said: 'I came here to see Jedward carry the Olympic torch. It was awesome because, like, they're Jedward.

'I didn't know it would be a big thing with a fire on top, I thought it was a torch you would shine stuff on.'

Lord Coe, chair of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games, said the event was everything organisers wanted.

'The welcome has been extraordinary,' he said. 'They've been 10, 15, 20 deep, they're hanging out of office windows, and I saw somebody halfway up a lamppost. That's commitment.

'I'm really pleased we came here. I felt it was a right thing to do.

'This is a country that's excellent at sport. You've got an extraordinary history in sport and having Michael Carruth run with it this morning symbolises what it's all about.'

Taoiseach Enda Kenny welcomed the torch to Government Buildings, which Queen Elizabeth visited last year.'The symbolism is so powerful,' said Mr Kenny. 'It epitomises in so many ways what the Olympics actually stand for - higher, faster and stronger - for all of those young people who can be inspired by sport, that they take up to become world champions.

'It's an enormous commitment for split-second timing to be the best in the world and to achieve Olympic glory and therefore, like Ronnie Delaney, everybody knows him because of his achievements in 1956.

'On behalf of the people of this country, it's great to have the Olympic flame come through.'

The choice of will.i.am as one of the torchbearers was met with widespread derision

The staging of the relay in Ireland 
will cost some 80,000 euro (£65,000) in addition to policing costs. Mr 
Hickey said the Olympic Council of Ireland would be spending some 
€30,000 (£24,000) and that a further €25,000 (£20,000) had been put 
forward by both the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and 
Dublin City Council towards the costs.

This evening the torch will be taken to Belfast from where it will cross to Scotland tomorrow.

Jedward's involvement comes after 
yesterday it emerged that some of the coveted places have been handed 
out by sponsors to their own staff.

Coca-Cola, Samsung and Adidas have distributed the positions to everyone from marketing executives to IT workers.

The remaining 800 places were given 
to stakeholders, such as the International Olympic Committee, as well as
to top sponsors to distribute internally.

These were then doled out to 
employees, most of whom appear to have been nominated for simply doing 
their job and several of whom have no connection to Britain.

London 2012 guidelines state that 
even internal candidates should be ’young people or have stories 
inspiring young people’ with ‘back stories of personal achievement’.

But instead of torchbearer places 
going to deserving customers or staff of the sponsors, in many instances
they have been bestowed on top executives.
