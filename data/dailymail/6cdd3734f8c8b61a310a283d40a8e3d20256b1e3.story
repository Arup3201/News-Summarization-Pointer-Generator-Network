Oculus Rift promises to bring virtual reality experiences to everyone but, with the general release not expected till next year, it's not yet widely available.

But if you don't want to wait, or don't have the money to shell out for a developer kit, one company has an alternative solution.

Their bizarre headset lets you strap an iPad Mini, or an upcoming iPhone 6 Plus, to your face and apparently gives wearers the same virtual reality experience as those enjoyed on Oculus Rift.

Toronto-based Metatecture is seeking funding for its AirVR device. The £30 ($49) virtual reality headset works by strapping an iPad to your face (shown)

AirVR, which will retail for £30 ($49), is a project from company Metatecture in Toronto, Canada.

They are currently seeking $20,000 in funding on Kickstarter to bring the product to market.

If funding is achieved they hope to begin rolling out the device later this year. 

Oculus VR was founded by 21-year-old college dropout Palmer Luckey.

It is designed to provide users with an immersive virtual reality experience not only for conventional video games, but for other activities as well.

Facebook purchased the company earlier this year when their $2bn (£1.2bn) deal to buy VR headset firm Oculus was approved.

It will first be used for immersive games, but Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised the headset will 'change the way we work, play and communicate' - although virtual worlds could include advertising admitted Zuckerberg.

A commercial version is rumoured to launch in 2015.

The purchase of Oculus put Facebook in a battle with Sony, who has already unveiled its own version of a VR headset, destined for the PS4 next year.

To use the headset an iPad Mini is slotted into the holder at the front, with its display then split into two identical screens just like on an Oculus Rift, providing a 3D virtual reality experience.

The user then straps the entire device to their head with straps, while foam pads ensure a comfortable fit.

Inside there are two lenses inside the headset which provide stereoscopic vision while looking at the iPad Mini.

Attaching headphones through the iPad Mini’s standard headphone port will also allow for sound to be played to the user.

While wearing the headset the user still has access to the buttons on the iPad Mini.

And the device also works with compatible gamepads so the user can enjoy gaming through the headset.

There is also a ‘TouchStrip’ of buttons on the headset to control AirVR in and out of the virtual reality experience. 

In addition, unlike other VR systems like the Oculus Rift this device does not require a power source in the headset; instead, it relies solely on the built-in battery of the iPad Mini.

For true 3D experiences apps and movies need to be developed specifically for such a virtual reality device. 

To show off the technology Metatecture has developed photo, movie and panorama apps for use with their headset.

By splitting the screen and providing two lenses the viewer then can be given a VR experience like Oculus Rift. The device will retail for about $49 and should be on sale later this year

The company is also developing a version for iPhone 6 Plus called AirVR+ (pictured). Previously they had tried to use the VR technology with the iPhone 5 but found the screen to be too small

‘The advanced 64-bit Processors and Graphics Systems allow AirVR to immerse users in vivid 3D worlds and experiences without the need for an external computer,’ the company explains on their Kickstarter page.

The company are also planning to bring the device to Apple's iPhone 6 Plus when it is released soon with AirVR+.

Previously they had tried to use the VR technology with the iPhone 5 but found the screen to be too small.

The larger screen size of the iPhone 6 Plus will allow them to replicate a similar virtual reality experience to that on the iPad Mini.
