Police forensic experts have been excavating part of a churchyard as they search for a 15-year-old boy who was apparently murdered by a paedophile gang after disappearing 25 years ago.

Lee Boxell was last seen in the High Street in Sutton, near Croydon, South London, in September 1988 when he was aged 15.

Today police started work on an area of the St Dunstan's Church at Cheam.

Hunt: Police and workers dig up a section of the graveyard in St Dunstan's Church, Cheam, as they launch a search in connection with the disappearance of Lee Boxell

Hunt: A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'We are conducting routine enquiries in connection with an historic investigation'

Missing: Lee Boxell, 15, was last seen in Sutton, Surrey in September 1988

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'We are 
conducting routine enquiries in connection with an historic 
investigation.'

Detectives have long suspected he was murdered by a paedophile gang linked to a youth club which met near the church in the 1980s.

They believe the teenager had discovered what was going on in a shed and had tried to stop the sexual crimes - causing others to want to kill him.

Part of the churchyard, which is less than a mile from where Lee was last seen, has been sealed off.

A police forensic team is using ground-penetrating radar in the area being searched.

The Metropolitan Police said the dig was 'routine activity' and part of its inquiry into the teenager's disappearance.

Officers began a search of the area near a shed, an outbuilding at the church, and the graveyard last year and had planned to resume the operation in April.

Last month Lee's parents appealed for information on the BBC's Crimewatch programme.

Since the broadcast, police have received an allegation of sexual abuse and callers came forward with information that was 'very focused' on the team's current line of inquiry.

Investigators said they were working on the theory Lee died after intervening to try to stop sexual abuse at the shed, which had been a target for sexual predators.

Search: Teams of workers began a dig in the churchyard today. It is believed the teenager may have been murdered by a paedophile gang

Probe: A section of the churchyard has been cordoned off while the investigation is carried out

Dig: The team of workmen arrive at the graveyard with materials today

Dig: The workers move soil from the corner of graveyard. It is not clear how long the work will be going on for
