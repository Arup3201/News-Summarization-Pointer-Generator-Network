A sword-wielding maniac who killed the mother of his children in front of them in 2008 and fled to Mexico has finally been arrested.

Jesus ‘Chuey’ Canales, who stabbed to death Lucy Preciado, 26, with a sword in front of their three children, was extradited Saturday from Mexico and will finally face charges stemming from the chilling murder.

The case received nationwide attention after Mr Canales fled the grisly murder scene. ‘America’s Most Wanted’ even featured him in a 2008 episode.

Detectives tracked the El Savador native from California to New Mexico, Texas, Mexico and his home country, officials said.

A tip led authorities to a small town in Jalisco, Mexico. Multiple law enforcement agencies including the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department, the U.S. Marshal’s Service and Mexican authorities worked together to track the accused killer down, police said.

Mexican officials detained Mr Canales on Thursday before deporting him and handing him over to US Mashals, authorities said.

He was then flown Friday to Los Angeles International Airport and handed over to the LASD, which arrested him and tossed him in jail while he awaits arraignment, cops said.

Mr Canales will be in court Monday morning to face murder and child endangerment charges, according to police.

Authorities had been hunting Mr Canales since his cold-blooded murder of Ms Preciado.

The woman had become fed up with his marijuana smoking and laziness, according to ‘America’s Most Wanted’ and had decided to leave him.

The violent man, then 28, became enraged and impaled her with a sword – turning the apartment he shared with her and their young children into a bloodbath.

The dead woman’s terrified nine-year-old daughter Marina called 911 just after the horrific murder happened.

‘Hello, my dad just stabbed my mom,’ the girl told the operator between tears.‘He what?’ the dispatcher asked.

‘He just stabbed my mom,’ she said again while crying.

‘With what?’

Such a tragic death: Ms Preciado's suspected killer may finally be brought to justice, but that won't return a mother lost by her four children

‘A sword,’ Marina said.

Other screaming children can be heard in the background, one of them shouting ‘Daddy!’ The Los Angeles Daily News reported.

The carwash attendant fled the scene as the girl tells the operator ‘please, just hurry up. I don’t want my mom to die,’ the Daily News continued.

‘To think about the trauma that was introduced into the children's lives, the tape, as you heard, is just gut-wrenching, and it affects everybody who becomes familiar with the case,’ a police spokesperson told local media shortly after the slaying, according to KABC.

Detectives were moved to tears by the dramatic call, a source told the station, adding it was the worst murder scene they had ever seen.

Invesitgators worked frantically to track him down, and narrowly missed snagging him in 2008 in New Mexico, according to the Albuquerque Journal.

He eluded authorities by only two hours, an official told the paper.

Friday’s arrest was the culmination of a five-year manhunt. If convicted, Mr Canales faces up to a life sentence in prison.
