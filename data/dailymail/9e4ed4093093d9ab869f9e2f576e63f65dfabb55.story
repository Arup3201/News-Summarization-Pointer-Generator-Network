A Houston, Texas couple was horrified when the baby monitor in their young child’s room was taken over by a hacker who verbally attacked them and even used their daughter’s name.

Marc Gilbert says he was doing the dishes following his birthday celebration when he heard strange sounds coming from 2-year-old Allyson’s bedroom.

He discovered they were coming from the baby monitor as a stranger’s voice called his sleeping daughter an ‘effing moron’ and ‘little slut’ before he quickly unplugged it.

Intrusion: This wireless baby monitor was taken over by a hacker who used profanity and verbally attacked 2-year-old girl and her parents

Appalling: Marc Gilbert heard sounds coming from his little girl's room and was horrified to find a stranger's voice coming from his daughter's baby monitor

The virtual intruder even knew Allyson by name because it was 
written just above her head, on the wall over where she dozed.

The hacker then yelled at Gilbert and his wife, using expletives in what they described as a ‘British or European accent.’

'He said, 'Wake up Allyson, you little (expletive),'" Gilbert said.

Allyson is deaf. Though she has a cochlear implant, it was turned off and she was never bothered by the shocking intrusion.

Then things became even creepier.

Helpless: Marc Gilbert says he believes his internet router was hacked and fears the intrusion has happened before without his or wife Lauren's knowledge

'I see the camera move on us,' Gilbert said.

‘At that point I ran over and disconnected it and tried to figure out what happened,’ Gilbert told ABC News.

The father of two did his research and now believes his home internet router was hacked and the monitor was subsequently accessed.

‘[I] couldn't see the guy. All you could do was hear his voice and he was controlling the camera,’ he said.

Gilbert said it was no different a violation than if the hacker had actually entered his home.

'It felt like somebody broke into our house,' Gilbert told KTRK.

Even worse, the Gilberts are forced to wonder if the hacking had occurred in the past.

‘It's quite possible that this had been going on more than one day,’ he said. ‘Security vulnerabilities exist.’

Making the creepy just plain scary: Gilbert said he took all the typical precautions to keep prying eyes out of his home.

'The router was password protected and the firewall was enabled,' Gilbert wrote in the comments section of the KTRK report. 'The IP camera was also password protected.'

Like his sister Allyson, the couple's 3-year-old son 
Ethan also managed not to hear the shameless intrusion.

But
 the terrifying experience has the Gilberts rattled enough to stop using
 the monitor that Marc says they once ‘couldn’t live without.’

'Wake up you little slut': The hacker even spoke the sleeping girl's name, which was written on the wall above her bed

Taking no chances: Now Marc Gilbert is forced to wonder if the hackers had ever struck before. The father of two has decided to permanently unplug the monitor, which he once said he and his wife couldn't live without

‘I don't think it ever will be connected again,’ he said.

The disturbing crime isn't unique, unfortunately.

The newly-crowned Miss Teen USA recently revealed she was secretly photographed in her room after her computer's webcam was hacked.

Cassidy Wolf, who took the crown on Saturday, said she was horrified to learn a stranger had hacked into her computer before trying to extort her on the promise the photos would not be leaked.

The 19-year-old from Temecula, California now travels the country to tell her story and warn other teenagers about cyber-crime.

For his part, Gilbert has plenty of reason to worry about the safety of his family, who have not appeared alongside him in reports of the camera hacking. He wanted to tell his story in order that other families know to be careful not to share the same terrible experience.

'As a father, I'm supposed to protect her against people like this. So it's a little embarrassing to say the least but it's not going to happen again,' Gilbert said.
