Bosses at one of Britain's top universities today warned students face being kicked off their course for naming and shaming sexual partners on an 'offensive' Facebook page.

Students have been posting details of sexual liaisons and links to the personal profile pages of those involved on the Loughborough Rate Your Sh*g page.

Similar pages have been sprung up at universities across the country, although social networking giant Facebook has said it has removed all of the pages which have been reported.

The pages see students give their peers marks out of ten on a range of factors. The Loughborough page has attracted around 2,500 'likes' in just a few days.

Furious bosses at high-ranking Loughborough University, Leicestershire, today branded many of the comments 'personal' and 'offensive'.

And they vowed to discipline students who posted on the site for contravening their policies on acceptable use of IT and harassment.

The institution - known for its sporting prowess - is ranked 12th in the Sunday Times 2013 university league table.

The page encouraged students to send their reviews to an administrator who then posted them anonymously on behalf of the users.

Elsewhere, more than 8,000 people have signed up for updates from the Newcastle University page, according to The Independent.

Harry Waddle, communications officer at Nottingham University, has also warned it would be considering disciplinary action against students writing defamatory posts.

Facebook has told MailOnline the pages break the website's rules and are quickly being removed when they are reported to Facebook.

A spokesman said: 'There is no place for harassment on Facebook, but unfortunately a small minority of malicious individuals exist online, just as they do offline. 

'We have a real name policy and provide people with simple tools to block people or report content which they find threatening so that we can remove it quickly.'

One female reviewer on the 
Loughborough Rate Your Sh*g said: 'Told me he was a pro, but when we got
 to the bedroom it was obvious that he had no idea what he was doing.'

The
 description on the page says: 'Loughborough, here's your opportunity to
 let everyone know who is good in bed, and who really isn't.

'Rate your sh*g from 1 to 10, and add comments and gossip.

'Message us your comments and we'll post them anonymously.

'Any student who posts inappropriate 
comments or material to this or other such sites is contravening the 
university's policies on acceptable use of IT and harassment and 
bullying'

'This
 page is just for a bit of fun, no offence is intended. If you feel a 
post is unfair then feel free to let us know and we'll take action.'

Comments on the page make reference to freshers' week, the athletics club, library, and a geography course.

The National Union of Students said the comments were 'not funny in the slightest', and 'tantamount to bullying'.

At least one concerned visitor to the site complained it was in breach of the Facebook acceptable use policy.

The page has now been taken down.

Pete Mercer, NUS Vice-President (Welfare), said: 'If you imagine seeing the name of a friend, partner or family member on these sites then you quickly realise why pages like this are not funny in the slightest and tantamount to bullying.

'NUS has long taken leadership on tackling bullying behaviour and these sites demonstrate that our work on tackling "lad culture" applies not just to men.

'"Banter" that seeks to humiliate and belittle is unacceptable and must be challenged both on and offline.'

A
 Loughborough University spokesman said: 'We have been made aware of a 
Facebook page that contains personal and offensive comments about people
 at the University.

'This is not a Loughborough University Facebook page.

'Any
 student who posts inappropriate comments or material to this or other 
such sites is contravening the university's policies on acceptable use 
of IT and harassment and bullying.

'As such, the university will take disciplinary action against them.'

Lawyers have warned Facebook and individual posters could be open to legal action as while the identities of the posters are not revealed, those being rated are in some cases identified, The Independent has reported.
