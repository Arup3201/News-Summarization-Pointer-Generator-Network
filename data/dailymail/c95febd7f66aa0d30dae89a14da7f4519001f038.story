Take a bunch of red-hot Chile peppers, stir in a simmering measure of brooding Argentine volatility, bring quickly to the boil and pour down the throats of the European aristocrats who strolled in here as the champions of world football.

Poor old Spain had no chance. They are going home choking on that fiery recipe.

Chile's Argentinian manager Jorge Sampaoli refers to his players as 'my courageous rebels.'

Gifted: Barcelona and Chile forward Alexis Sanchez played a key role in Spain's downfall

When they play with the irreverent passion which lit up the Maracana on Wednesday night, Chile can indeed over-throw pretty well any established order.

Yet off the pitch the beautifully gifted Alexis Sanchez and his team-mates come across as the most relaxed footballers at Brazil 2014.

That paradox is a major part of what makes this Chile team so refreshingly unpredictable to deal with.

They are without fear. As a football nation they have learned to live with defeat down the decades so now they are taking their triumphs one by one, celebrating each as if they have won the World Cup.

What do they have to lose? These players or the multitude of fans, inside and outside the stadium, who made such an ecstatic racket that it might have been heard back in Santiago?

Nothing. Not when they have knocked out the World Cup holders with a team including two men who will be playing not in our Premier League next season but down in the Championship? 

Defenders Gonzalo Jara, of Nottingham Forest, and Gary Medel, just relegated with Cardiff City, shut out the multi-million pound talents of Diego Costa, David Silva and Fernando Torrres as if they were run-of-the-mill opponents on any old Saturday afternoon in England.

But then rebels with a cause don't tend to suffer from an inferiority complex.

'We knew we could beat Spain,' said Sampaoli. 'They have been a great team for six years but we have always given them trouble by daring to attack them. The way we risk going at everybody. We also knew that success is not forever.'

This manager is a walking contradiction, too. For 90 minutes on the touchline he looks as if he is suffering an apoplectic fit. No sooner does the final whistle blow than he is gently  embracing Vicente del Bosque, sympathising with his Spanish counter-part and reminding him of how proud he should be of all those achievements.

As for the players, they are from the people, of the people and united with the people.

No prima-donna celebrities here. They mingle with their countrymen and women, happily posing for 'selifies', chatting about the game.

And you suspect they sympathise privately with their couple of hundred of ticketless red-shirted fans who stormed the barricades at the Maracana and broke through walls at the media centre in their bid to see the match.

Sanchez & Co did not have to force entry to the stadium but they did their bravura rampaging on the pitch.

This group are no respecters of reputations. Carlos Bravo, their captain whose assured goalkeeping provided a solid foundation for this victory which has changed the direction of world football,l warns the rest of the  best when he says;  'We go out to tackle every match the same way, whoever our opponents are. And now we have a weight lifted from us because we've proved we are a strong team.' 

England learned how strong when Chile won that warm-up friendly at Wembley.

Defeat for Spain, when it really mattered, was more profoundly devastating and all the harder to stomach  because Sanchez helped inflict it on a number of his team-mates at Barcelona.

He was not one of the two scorers but he is their principle hope for progressing even further than the last 16, for which they have already qualified so spectacularly.

Whether they do so may depend on them upsetting Holland the bold way they turned over Spain.

They and the Dutch are both going through in high style but the losers of that final group game are most likely to face Brazil in the first knock-out stage.

And the host nation are the only ones about whom the Chileans do nurse a paronoia.

Not surprisingly since a home win in a World Cup qualifying game in 2008 represents their only victory over Brazil in 21 years and 16 matches.  Not only that but their record against them is played 70, won 8, drawn 12…..and lost 50.

Might Senor Sampaoli be the one to make them fly in the face of such daunting history, if necessary? 

Maybe. Since he had not enjoyed significant success as manager of a variety of clubs across South America, he was an unusual choice to begin with.

And perhaps, when asked if beating Spain was his best victory, he was being prophetic as well as philosophical when he replied: 'The best victory is always the next victory.'
