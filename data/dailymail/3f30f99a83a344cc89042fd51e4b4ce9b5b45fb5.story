An Oregon woman arrested
on a drug charge while traveling in East Timor arrived home in
Portland on Wednesday to a swarm of national and local media
after six months of diplomatic negotiations.

Stacey Addison, who said she was never in possession of
drugs, was imprisoned for two months and then released without
travel documents in December, leaving her unable to leave the
Southeast Asian country. 

'It feels really good to be back home. Really strange, but
really good,' said Addison, a 41-year-old veterinarian who was
initially detained when a man with whom she shared a cab was
arrested on drug charges last September.

Long-term stay : After her release from prison, former East Timorese President and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jose Ramos-Horta housed Addison in guest quarters within his home

Prison conditions were basic, but she was treated well,
Addison said at Portland International Airport.

After Addison's release from prison, former East Timorese
President and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jose Ramos-Horta housed
her in guest quarters within his home.

'I did make some friends,' Addison said of her time seeking
permission to return home to the United States. 'And it helped
having support behind me back home.'

A travel enthusiast whose planned two-year-journey had
already taken her from Antarctica through South America before
her detention, Addison said she still intends to explore more of
the world once she has recovered from her ordeal.

'I don't anticipate anything happening like this again. I
hope not,' she said with a laugh, as she held the hand of her
mother, Bernadette Kero.

'I'm glad to have her back,' Kero said as she ushered her daughter away from reporters. 

'It's a great feeling,' Addison said in an interview with KOIN. 'It's a relief to finally be back home. To be out of there after all this time, so I'm really happy to be home.'

'I'm not going to let go of her,' Kero told the television station.

'It's been really hard, it's been an emotional roller coaster having all these setbacks, getting hopes up and having them crash down, getting hopes up and having them crash down,' Addison told KOIN. 'So, I'm glad finally for it to be over.'

Kero enlisted U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon and
Secretary of State John Kerry to negotiate with East Timorese
diplomats for the return of Addison's passport.
