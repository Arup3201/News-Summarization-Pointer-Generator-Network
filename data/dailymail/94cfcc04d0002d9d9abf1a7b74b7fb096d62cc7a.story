It was first used in the 1800s to ridicule eccentrically-dressed men and was later consolidated into American teen speak through 80s cult movies.

But although it is still the most common way to refer to your friends, it seems the word 'dude' is actually far more popular in certain parts of the U.S. than others.

According to new data, the term of endearment - made popular through the likes of Wayne's World and Bill and Ted - has been replaced with bro, buddy and fella in many parts of the country.

Dude is still the most common term of endearment in the U.S and is mainly used by those in the southwest

In the north of the country, the most popular moniker appears to be 'buddy', according to this map 

Although it is still the dominant force in the southwest, those in the deep south of the U.S tend to use the word 'bro' to refer to their friends.

Meanwhile, those in the north of the country prefer to use 'buddy', while 'pal' is almost exclusively used in the northeast.

'Fella' - one of the least popular vocatives - is more scattered around the country. 

The research, published by Quartz on an interactive map, was put together by Jack Grieve, who analysed billions of tweets which had been collated by Diansheng Guo from the University of South Carolina.

The linguist identified different monikers used across the U.S, before grouping them together depending on the geography of the tweets.

The word 'bro' tends to be reserved for those living in the south, according to data taken from Twitter

Meanwhile, the word 'fella' tends to be more scattered around the country, but is not as popular 

The research, by linguist Jack Grieve, shows the word 'pal' is most popular in the north of the country 

He found that there were certain areas of the map where certain words were used more than others. 

One common word not included in the data was 'man'. Mr Grieve said the word is used in too many other contexts to be able to be accurately included. 

Quartz also said most of the tweets had been sent by white men, which it said showed the bias of the English language against women and those of other races.
