Thousands of spectators poured into the Olympic Park this evening ahead of the Paralympic Opening Ceremony.

The excited fans were clad in patriotic outfits including Union Jack suits as home fans dominated the walkways that lead to the east London venue which looked ready to burst into life as designers laid the finishing touches ahead of the show.

And as Games fans geared up for the extravaganza, organisers insisted the Paralympic flame would arrive at the stadium at the scheduled time of 10pm, after severe delays during the torch relay.

A Locog spokesman said: 'We are still hoping to get there. We have been cutting out breaks and things like that on the way so we are making up time.'

Volunteers carrying the torch which 
was to be used in the ceremony fell as far as two hours behind schedule,
forcing organisers to cut timings to get it back on track.

This
afternoon they were forced to 'split' the flame by lighting a separate 
lantern and taking it directly to the Olympic Park as a contingency 
measure.

The delay was 
caused overnight when an event at the birthplace of the Paralympics, 
Stoke Mandeville Hospital, overran and there were problems when 
transferring the flame.

The flame arrived in London today when
it reached the Shree Swaminarayan Hindu temple in Willesden, Brent, 
amid cheers and traditional prayers.

From
there it set off on its journey through six host boroughs in the 
capital on its way to the Olympic Stadium and has already gone past the 
iconic Abbey Road.

Although the relay was about two hours behind schedule when the torch was lit from a miner's lamp just before 8.30am, organisers said they hoped to claw back the delay.

A Locog spokesman said: 'A lantern lit by the unified flame will be carried by Paralympian, Chris Holmes, to City Hall for a celebration event this lunchtime. This flame will then travel to the stadium.

'Should the torch relay run late, this flame will be used to light the cauldron during the Paralympic Opening Ceremony this evening. The torch relay will continue to Stratford Park for the planned celebration.

'From there the relay flame will be transferred to a lantern and used as the back up flame during the Games.'

Meanwhile Prime Minister David Cameron said the Games would change people's views about disability.

He told Channel 4 News: 'I think they are going to to make the whole country incredibly proud. The Olympic Games made us proud but I think this will make us prouder still because you are going to see an extraordinary display of sport.

'We can be very proud that more Paralympians are taking part in more sports, in more stadia, watched by more people than at any time in the past.

'It's been a sell-out and that is, I think, a great story for our country and it will inspire a lot of people and change people's views about disability and that is absolutely crucial.'

While temperatures will struggle to 
get above 15C during the evening, the rain clouds will have disappeared 
by 8.30pm, when the Games officially get under way.

Helen Rossington, a forecaster for 
MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, said: 'There 
will be rain and showers throughout the day but it should be dry by the 
time the ceremony starts.

'It might be chilly though compared to
how it was for the Olympics opening ceremony and there will be a brisk 
south-westerly wind. But it won't be raining, which is the important 
thing. There is only a very slight chance of a shower.'

Cheers: Crowds included many disabled people keen to support the Paralympic relay

The torch was two hours late when it left the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Temple in north-west London this morning

Speaking of the torchbearers, she 
added: 'Some of them will definitely get wet. There could be quite heavy
rain throughout the morning, with the whole of the UK being unsettled.'

Thousands of members of the Armed Forces will receive free tickets to the Paralympic Games.

Over 5,000 will be able to watch fellow troops who have been injured on the front line thanks to the charity Tickets for Troops and the London 2012 Ticketshare scheme.

Army personnel were drafted  in after security firm G4S was unable to provide enough staff for the Olympic Games.

Today the company admitted it had delivered just 83 per 
cent of contracted shifts and that it was confident the Paralympic Games
- starting tomorrow - would be fully staffed with a security workforce.

It was also revealed that G4S will play a bigger role in the Paralympics with an extra 3,000 workers available for the Games.

This means the company will have up to 10,000 workers despite only needing 5,000 on the ground to prevent a humiliating repeat of the Olympics security fiasco.

Nick Buckles, head of the firm, told the Daily Mirror: 'We are holding a buffer of staff every day to make sure that we can fulfil the contract.'

The security company has also reported a £50million loss on the contract for both the Olympics and Paralympics.

The band of rain will travel east, bringing showers behind it, with the most persistent downpours happening in the morning.

During the day, temperatures will 
reach a high of 20C in the south of England as the torch relay takes 
place, with some sunshine between the showers.

Despite much of the relay taking place under cover of darkness, thousands of people turned out on a clear and chilly night to watch its journey and cheer on the proud torchbearers.

Working in teams of five, the torchbearers, both disabled and non-disabled, carried the flame from the stadium to the National Spinal Injuries Centre in the village, before bearing it through Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire to Watford and then on to London.

The Paralympic relay made a pop stop off to visit Abbey Road in St John's Wood, north-west London.

Five torchbearers took the flame across the zebra crossing and recreated The Beatles' famous pose for the cover of their 1969 album Abbey Road.

Crowds lined the street, cheered and 
waved Union flags as Graham Helm, 38, from Lancashire, paraded the flame
back across the Fab Four landmark on his own before walking it up the 
road.

Mr Helm, registered blind four years ago, was nominated as a torchbearer for his work with young people.

Ria Amiraly, a special needs teacher from St John's Wood, said the atmosphere at the relay had been 'buzzing'.

The
28-year-old said: 'You don't get to see people talking every day to 
each other like they did today, it was fascinating to be part of it.

The torch, carried by William Parkinson, Steven Randerson, Sonia Allen, Nicola Roesch and Jane Loder between Watford and Bushey, carried on through the night

'The Paralympics are more important to me because I work with special needs children, I think it's great that people with disabilities are going out there and taking part in sport, it's really important,' she added.

Arvind Devalia, a 41-year-old writer and life coach, said: 'I had to be here, I live just round the corner.

'I have been waiting since 7.30 this morning and the torch went by fast, but it was well worth waiting for three hours.

'For me it was about the atmosphere and the camaraderie, people were so friendly and chatty and it was such a great vibe.'
