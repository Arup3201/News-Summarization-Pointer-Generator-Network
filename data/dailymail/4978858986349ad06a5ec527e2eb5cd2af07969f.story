As one Lambert shuffled out of Villa Park fretting privately about what the future holds, another Lambert bounded out with a renewed sense of purpose.

If things have been increasingly bleak for Aston Villa manager Paul, the season has hardly gone to plan for Liverpool striker Rickie either. His starts have been rare, goals scarce and speculation increased that he might move on in this window.

West Brom and Crystal Palace are keen but he is not interested. Lambert’s dream came true when he moved to Anfield from Southampton last June and he won’t give up on it just because the transition has been bumpy.

Lambert was visibly overjoyed at scoring his second Premier League goal for Liverpool

Why should he? The 32-year-old substitute may have been on the pitch for only 20 minutes here but he made a difference, sweeping in the goal that guaranteed a win. Such was his joy, he almost jumped into the Witton Lane Stand to celebrate with Liverpool’s fans.

‘That’s the best way to affect a game,’ said Lambert. ‘In the past I maybe would have passed instead of taking it on myself. It was nice to secure the game after Simon Mignolet had saved us. He was brilliant.

‘I love those celebrations, I love watching them on TV. To do it myself with the Liverpool fans is something I’ll always remember. The best moment I’ve felt since I’ve been here. Brilliant.

‘I’ve no intention of leaving Liverpool while they want me. If they don’t want me I’ll go but I’m here to help in whatever way I can.’

His manager believes he is doing that. 

Brendan Rodgers pumped the air with his fist as Lambert’s drive sneaked past Brad Guzan.

‘I was delighted for him,’ said Rodgers. ‘He is making the contribution I wanted. There is a spotlight on him because of the unavailability of other players but he was brought in to make an effect. He’ll always score goals.’

There will be no dwelling on this win, not with Chelsea in town on Tuesday for the first part of their Capital One Cup semi-final. Few will give Liverpool hope of victory over two legs.

‘I went to the Champions League semi-final against Chelsea in 2005,’ Lambert said. ‘It was the best atmosphere I’ve ever experienced. Can we do the same? It would be brilliant. We’re getting better, we’ve got players coming back and we’re still in all the cups.

‘Chelsea will probably be favourites but we’ve got the winning mentality back. I can’t talk all day about iconic games from the past. We want to have our own.’
