Most Aussies will pile on a couple of kilos throughout the silly season which may not seem like a lot but research shows that that excess weight is rarely lost after the holiday period ends.

Unlike the northern hemisphere, a lot of Australians take off most of January while kids are on school holidays when it is easy to throw any kind of routine or exercise out the window until after Australia Day near the end of the month.

Nobody likes a party pooper but there are ways to enjoy the festive season without going over the top and feeling sluggish as most Australians will gain 0.8-1.5kg during the Christmas period.

Nutritionist Dr Joanna McMillan speaks to Daily Mail Australia about her top three tips on how to cparty with the best of them while destroying all of your good work you done throughout the year.

One of the first things Dr Joanna noticed when moving from the U.K. to Australia 15 years ago was that Australian have a prolonged period of time over the Christmas break.

'People always come to me in the new year and say 'I feel rubbish",' she said.

'It's worse here because it's not just that couple of weeks because there's the lead up to Christmas and then lots of people go on holiday in January.'

'There is that saying it doesn't matter what you do between Christmas and new year but what you do between new year and Christmas that counts.'

'Spending time with family and friends is absolutely a key part of your health and happiness,' Dr Joanna says

Enjoy yourself during the festive season

There is no need to become anti social to avoid putting on weight during the holiday break.

'I'm always most concerned when people talk to me about actually being scared to go to social functions because they feel like can't trust themselves around the food and drink side of it and that is not healthy,' Dr Joanna said.

'Enjoy the Christmas season and the parties and being social and spending time with family and friends is absolutely a key part of your health and happiness.'

'You don't have to be a goody two-shoes and get it all right i mean goodness I'm in this job and I get it wrong too sometimes,' she said.

'It's about being human but just think about the choices you are making from a lifestyle, dietary and health perspective - you can't let it all go and not think about your health.'

Between napping on the sofa, sitting in the beer garden and laying on the beach - get your body moving

Do something active everyday

Between napping on the sofa, sitting in the beer garden and laying on the beach - get your body moving.

'It might be a half hour walk or a yoga class - or maybe gardening for a couple of hours just doing something that keeps you moving and breaks up our sedentary time in the day which is really important,' Dr Joanna said.

'If you're an office worker - get up every hour and go to speak to a colleague rather than phoning or emailing.' 

The 'all or nothing' attitude is never going to be a winner.

'I also think its a good idea for people who exercise hard to take a bit of break but it's going from eating well and exercising regularly to doing nothing that isn't good,' she said.

'Do different exercise maybe go for long walks - in summer its lovely to get out early morning or early evening and getting outdoors.'

'When you are out of routine with more food and drink around you don't get to gym as much and do your usual exercise you can start the year with an extra couple of kilos and feeling a bit run down.' 

Don't turn up hungry to functions so you can control how many canapes you grab off the platter

Be consciously aware of what you are eating  

Dr Joanna advises to keep hold of the reins while allowing you to enjoy social situations

'Exercise conscious control over what you are eating - be mindful about the way you are eating,' she said.

'If you are at a party and there are canapes don't take one from every plate that walks past give it a little bit more thought - think about "am I really hungry?".'

'Don't go to the party ravenously hungry so you devour anything that's there,' she said.

'Be cognitive about what you are eating and when to stop eating because I think those situations at parties is when people fall short they don't realise how many plates they have had from the buffet.'

'It's this unconscious eating where you are not really enjoying it.'
