It's a good job political scion and TV reality star Bristol Palin enjoys being in the spotlight.

Video uploaded to the 24-year-old's Instagram account shows how her Medal of Honor winning boyfriend Dakota Meyer took a very public approach to their wedding engagement last Friday night.

The clip shows Rascal Flatts lead singer, Gary LeVox, dedicating a song to the couple in front of hundreds of spectators at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas before Meyer pops the big question backstage.

Show-stopper: Video uploaded to Bristol Palin's Instagram account shows how her Medal of Honor winning boyfriend Dakota Meyer took a very public approach to their wedding engagement last Friday night - popping the big question at a Las Vegas concert

Luckily, Palin said 'yes' and LeRox tells fans, when he gets the go-ahead, the happy news.

'Hey Vegas, she said yes!' he exclaims, triggering rapturous cheers. 

The following day Palin uploaded a shot of her passionately kissing 26-year-old Meyer to her Instagram account, captioned: 'Truly the luckiest girl in the world, cannot wait to marry this man!'

The mother-of-one then uploaded a picture of her engagement ring and wrote a piece on her Patheos blog.

'He’s so romantic!' she said of her husband-to-be.

She continued: 'He asked me to marry him at a Rascal Flatts concert. The lead singer, Gary LeVox, dedicated “Bless the Broken Road” to us, and then Dakota got down on one knee and proposed!

'It’s amazing to see what happens when you place everything in life in God’s hands. He really is good and His plans are so much greater than our own.' 

Romantic: Bristol Palin, the 24-year-old daughter of the former Alaska governor Sarah Palin shared the news of her engagement to Dakota Meyer on her Intsagram page on Saturday

Happy: She then uploaded a picture of the engagement ring followed by a string of heart symbols 

Palin and Meyer met on the set of Sarah Palin's Amazing America TV show. 

They have apparently been dating for less than a year but clearly felt it was the right time to take their relationship to the next stage.

Kentucky native Meyer, who served in the Marines for four years, also shared his excitement on social media over their upcoming nuptials, saying: 'I'm definitely the luckiest guy ever to be able to spend the rest of my life with [Bristol].'

The couple only recently started positing pictures together.

Last week Palin uploaded an image of the pair playing in the snow with her six-year-old son, who she had with former fiancé Levi Johnson when she was just 17.

Since her mother's failed bid to become vice president in 2008, Bristol has appeared on Dancing with the Stars and featured in her own Lifetime show about raising her son, titled Bristol Palin: Life's a Tripp.

She also released a best-selling memoir in 2011, Not Afraid of Life: My Journey So Far.

Excitement: Meyer, who served in the Marines for four years, also shared his excitement on social media, saying: 'I'm definitely the luckiest guy ever to be able to spend the rest of my life with [Bristol]' 

Reaction: Sarah Palin congratulated the pair on Twitter after their announcement 

Meyer was awarded the Medal of Honor in 2011 after repeatedly charging into a kill zone during a 2009 ambush in Kunar Province, Afghanistan in search of four of his missing Marines.

He was able to rescue 36 troops and kill eight Taliban attackers despite being shot in the arms.

Tragically he was not able to save his four fellow Marines and friends who he went in search of, but went back and carried each of their bodies to safety.

He caused a stir in December for taunting ISIS members on Twitter on Facebook - calling them cowards.

He also wrote: 'Wonder if any ISIS members want to drop by and join my book club.'

Bristol broke up with ex-partner Johnson in 2009 and started an intense custody battle.

However, in the midst of the battle, they also briefly reunited and got engaged again. The engagement was short lived when they broke up for a second time in the summer of 2010.

Johnston has been married to Sunny since October 2012 and have two children together.  

Family: A picture of Meyer with his arm around his future mother-in-law Sarah Palin was also uploaded 

Esteemed: Meyer was awarded the Medal of Honor bny Barack Obama in 2011 after repeatedly charging into a kill zone during a 2009 ambush in Kunar Province, Afghanistan in search of four of his missing comrades

Relationship: It's not clear when the couple started dated, but have only recently started positing pictures together
