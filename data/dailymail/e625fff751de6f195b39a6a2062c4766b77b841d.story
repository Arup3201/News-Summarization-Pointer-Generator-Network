Real Madrid have secured the signature of the hottest teenager in world football by beating Europe's giants to Stromsgodset's Martin Odegaard.

The attacking midfielder is still only 16-years-old but has commanded wages of £80,000-per-week after becoming Norway's youngest ever international in August last year aged 15.

But what were the planet's biggest stars doing when they were 16, where were they playing and were they as talked-about as Odegaard? Sportsmail takes a look...

Stromsgodset teenager Martin Odegaard has completed a move to Real Madrid for a fee of £2.3million

Odegaard became the youngest player to represent his national team when he played for Norway aged 15

Lionel Messi, 27, Barcelona

Where he was at 16: Barcelona

Messi was breaking into Barcelona's first team and at 16 made his uncompetitive debut in a friendly against Porto in Portugal.

He came on in the 75th minute with the No 14 shirt on his back, brown hair flopping all over the place and long sleeves pulled over his knuckles.

In that 15 minutes he almost scored twice and was making the same penetrating dribbles – although getting tackled a few more times than nowadays – and darting runs into the box.

He would not make his debut in a competitive match until he was 17.

Cristiano Ronaldo, 29, Real Madrid

Where he was at 16: Sporting Lisbon

The thin, gangly Ronaldo was already training with Sporting Lisbon's first team at 16 and on the verge of making his senior debut.

Ronaldo's mother was flown in from Madeira to help ease through the homesick teenager with obvious exceptional talent.

He became the first player in Sporting's history to play for their Under 16, Under 17, Under 18, B team and first team in one season although his senior league debut, where he scored twice, did not come until he had turned 17.

Manuel Neuer, 28, Bayern Munich

Where he was at 16: Schalke

Typically for a goalkeeper of such tender years, Neuer was nowhere near making his first-team debut at that age. But he was in the process of working his way through every single age group of his home-town club, which he had joined at an astounding five-years-old. 

He would have to wait until he turned 20 to make a breakthrough into the senior side and has not looked back since.

Gareth Bale, 25, Real Madrid

Where he was at 16: Southampton

The 16-year-old Bale made his debut for Southampton in the Championship, playing at left-back but scoring regularly from free kicks and attracting the attention of several top flight teams. 

That season he won the Welsh Sports Personality of the Year award and went on to become the Football League Young Player of the Year, before moving to Tottenham in the summer.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic, 33, Paris Saint-Germain

Where he was at 16: Malmo

Ibrahimovic signed for Swedish club Malmo as a 15-year-old but was already being paraded around Europe a year later. He was the same incredibly cocky character he is today, famously telling Arsene Wenger he did not do trials when taken to visit the Arsenal manager.

Wenger has said: 'He was 16. I asked him to have a little training session with the first team and he didn't want to do it. Do I regret it? No. I will continue to do that unless our scouts have seen the player and says, "Look he is absolutely 100 per cent". I trust them.'

He did not, however, break into Malmo's senior team until he was 18 and moved to Ajax a year later.

Luis Suarez, 27, Barcelona

Where he was at 16: Nacional

What was the precociously talented Suarez doing in his sweet 16th year? 

He head-butted a referee after being shown a red card and was told he would ruin his career if continued drinking and partying. 

He was at Uruguayan side Nacional, where he would have to wait until he was 18 to break into the senior team.

Philipp Lahm, 31, Bayern Munich

Where he was at 16: Bayern Munich

The full-back, now often playing as a defensive midfielder, was captaining Bayern Munich's youngsters to the youth Bundesliga title, the second time he won it.

Even at 16, there was never any doubt amongst those at Bayern that he would break through. Former youth coach Hermann Hummels said at the time: 'If Philipp Lahm will not make it in the Bundesliga, nobody will anymore.'

He captained their B team at 17 and made his first-team debut two years later.

Wayne Rooney, 29, Manchester United

Where he was at 16: Everton

The England striker was smashing his way into Everton's senior team when he was 16. He became their second-youngest player to feature in the first team, behind Joe Royal, when he made his debut against Tottenham in August 2002.

By October that season he had netted his first goals, scoring twice in a win away to Wrexham in the League Cup.

But he properly introduced himself to world football when, five days before his 17th birthday, he became the youngest player to score in the Premier League with an edge-of-the-box curler sent in off the crossbar in the last minute to end Arsenal's 30-match unbeaten run.

Eden Hazard, 24, Chelsea

Where he was at 16: Lille

Hazard had moved from Belgium to France as a 14-year-old to develop as a player and was called up to Lille's reserve team at 16, which was competing in the fourth tier of French football, while still featuring regularly for their Under 18s.

Within six months he had impressed so much he was called into the senior side for a friendly and made his league debut against Nancy from the bench that November. It would take a while before he established himself as a first-team regular.

Arjen Robben, 30, Bayern Munich

Where he was at 16: Groningen

The rapid winger was already developing his trademark cut in from the right flank to score sensational strikes with his left boot in Dutch Eredivisie side Groningen at 16. 

He scored three times in his debut season and would eventually seal a move to PSV two years later.

Neymar, 22, Barcelona

Where he was at 16: Santos

The Brazilian sensation was being hotly pursued by the biggest clubs in Europe by this time. He visited Real Madrid and AC Milan and had the likes of Manchester United drooling over him.

He was already commanding Santos youth matches with step-overs and skills, but opted to stay in Brazil – debuting for Santos at 17 and scoring 14 times in his first season – until he was 21.
