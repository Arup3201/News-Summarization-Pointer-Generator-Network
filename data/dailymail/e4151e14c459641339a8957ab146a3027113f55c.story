Tottenham Hotspur have renewed interest in Ukraine winger Yevhen Konoplyanka.

The 25-year-old is out of contract at Dnipro in the summer and Spurs have begun talks.

Liverpool failed with a £20million move a year ago as they ran out of time amid red tape and payment demands.

Dnipro are reluctant to let him leave for free so will push for a £7m deal now. 

Manchester United, Everton, West Ham, Monaco and Inter Milan are all keen but Spurs are understood to be favoured by the player.

Juventus have discussed a move for Paulinho and Parma have enquired about Etienne Capoue. Emmanuel Adebayor’s wages have ended interest from Roma.
