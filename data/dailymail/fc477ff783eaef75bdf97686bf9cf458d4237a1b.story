A man in New Jersey has been arrested after he allegedly shot down a private flying drone with a shotgun.

The drone's owner said he was using his remote-controlled device to survey construction work at a friend's house in Lower Township, on the Jersey Shore, on Friday afternoon.

He was flying the camera-equipped helicopter around when he heard several blasts from nearby.

Seconds later, the drone began to lose altitude and fell off the sky, NBC Philadelphia reported.

Russell Percenti, 32, was arrested in New Jersey after he allegedly shot down with a shotgun a drone similar to the one pictured

The owner recovered the felled drone a few minutes later â€” plus a few holes from a shotgun.

Police in Lower Township canvassed the area and allegedly found the shotgun at the home of Russell Percenti, 32.

Cops did not say why Percenti, a waiter at a nearby restaurant, blasted the drone out of the sky.

He was arraigned on charges of criminal mischief and weapons charges.

Percenti was released after posting $250 bail.

The Federal Aviation Administration requires drones to fly below 400 feet and staying clear of nearby airports.

In New Jersey, lawmakers introduced drone-specific legislation this year, but the proposal was vetoed by Gov. Chris Christie in January.
