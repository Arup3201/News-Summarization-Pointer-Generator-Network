When toned Daniel Craig stepped out of the sea in his blue trunks in Quantum of Solace, women around the world swooned.

But while they may admire the actor's physique as James Bond, it seems they wouldn't want to date such a muscular man in real life.

According to a new study, three quarters of British women find buff bodies a turn-off and say they prefer their partner to have a bit of flab.

Similarly, 58 per cent say they would choose a man with love handles over one with a six pack.

Celebrities women would choose ahead of hunky 007 actor Craig include Mr Darcy actor Colin Firth, pop star Robbie Williams and Wolf of Wall Street star Leonardo DiCaprio.

An overwhelming 96 per cent of women think a dinner date with an abs-obsessed man would be dull.

Almost three quarters - 72 per cent - would rather the date was with a chubbier fella so that they would feel more able to indulge in dessert.

Of those in a relationship, 94 per cent say they love their man just as he is even if he has piled on a few extra pounds.

Again, the vast majority - 91 per cent - of women would rather their man spent 'couple' time with them than pumped iron.

Almost as many - 82 per cent - would never nag their other half to work out or diet to improve their physique.

Exactly three quarters would rather be hugged by a flabby fella than a gym-hardened muscleman.

And 74 per cent admit they would feel self-conscious taking their clothes off in front of a perfectly toned man.

Just desserts: Many women said they would rather date a man who wasn't obsessed with working out so they wouldn't feel guilty about tucking into pudding

Nationally, 72 per cent of women have an appetite for an 'Average Joe' while being turned off by men with muscles.

But that figure rises to 80 per cent of ladies in the North East and Northern Ireland.

Over three quarters - 77 per cent - of women say their ideal man would not have a chiselled torso like James Bond actor Daniel Craig or Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington.

Instead, their dream date - cited by 33 per cent - is more likely to be Colin Firth, who memorably emerging from a lake in a wet shirt as Pride and Prejudice's dashing Mr Darcy.

Next come Williams (20 per cent), DiCaprio (18 per cent), followed by funnyman James Corden and Twilight movie star Robert Pattinson (each nine per cent).

Opposite sides of the fence: The survey was carried out to celebrate the release of Bad Neighbours on DVD, which sees beer-bellied Seth Rogen pitted against toned Zac Efron

Other popular celebrities not renowned for rippling muscles include comic Ricky Gervais, TOWIE's James 'Arg' Argent and The Inbetweeners' James Buckley.

Only women aged under 25 tend to be attracted to muscly hunks with 49 per cent of them fancying a man with a six pack compared to just 18 per cent of over 55s.

The survey of 1,000 women was carried out to mark the release on DVD and Blu-ray of film Bad Neighbours, which pits buff college boy Zac Efron against beer-bellied family man Seth Rogen.

Relationship expert Tracey Cox, who writes the blog Pillow Talk for MailOnline commented: 'Eye candy is never a bad thing but when it comes to choosing a partner, in reality, buff-bodied men are just not what most women want for real-life partners.

'Most women worry about their bodies, so we know the hard work and dedication that goes into getting a buff, toned body.

'A man with a perfect body has probably restricted his diet and alcohol intake and spends hours in the gym. All this suggests he's not going to be much fun as a partner.

'We feel more comfortable with a bit of flab over super toned abs. Women are already under extreme pressure to look a certain way and we figure that a man who appears less critical of his own appearance and obsessed with looks will be less critical of ours.'
