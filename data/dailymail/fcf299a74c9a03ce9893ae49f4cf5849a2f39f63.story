A group of pensioners have bought their retirement village after its owners went bust.

The previous owners of the Woodchester Valley Village, near Stroud in the Cotswolds, Bluchie Limited went into liquidation three years ago.

And since then, the residents of the complex - previously called Crystal Fountain Village - have been fighting to buy the freehold to the retirement complex.

Celebration: Residents of the Woodchester Valley Village in Stroud who brought their retirement village after the owners went into administration

After three years of hard work, plus determined fund raising, the pensioners have now bought the freehold from the administrators.

Leading the fight was Residents' Association chairman Peter Wilson, who said the purchase had dominated his life for the past three years.

He said: 'Buying the freehold has been a long, hard struggle but we won through because we worked together.

'We were backed by villagers' families and, in some cases, even their grandchildren.

Proud owners: The complex - previously known as the Crystal Fountain Village - has 73 houses and flats

'Woodchester Valley Village now welcomes all those who seek something different. It's a new type of village for active over sixties who enjoy life.'

Residents at the complex live independently but can be supported if necessary.

It is professionally managed, with staff on-site 24 hours a day and domiciliary care available if required.

Vice chairman of the residents' association and leading light in the buyout Betty Young said: 'Woodchester Valley offers the over sixties a real village community, with company when it is wanted, but with the independence and privacy of a home with its own front door.

'We believe this is the future and we hope it will be the model for other villages to follow, so that they can also take full control of their homes.'

The future? The group's Residents' Association hope that other retirement villages will follow their example

The complex is nestled in 25 acres of Cotswolds countryside adjoining the National Trust's famous Woodchester Park.

The village has 73 houses and apartments, plus communal areas including a lounge, a library and a green room and is close to Gloucester, Bath and Bristol.

Residents frequently organise activities such as play reading, book groups and bridge as well as visits to theatres, cinemas, and historic gardens.
