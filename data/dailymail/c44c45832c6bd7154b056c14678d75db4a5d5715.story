A Delaware company has recalled 16 varieties of cheese after they were linked to a listeria outbreak last year, which caused one death in California and at least three illnesses in newborn babies.

The CDC said the Hispanic-style cheeses are produced by Roos Foods of Kenton, Delaware. The dangerous products are the company's Mexicana, Amigo, Santa Rosa De Lima and Anita brands.

The products were distributed in Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia. One person died in California and seven people were reported as ill in Maryland.

Bacteria: Amigo Brand was also linked to outbreak

Three of those sickened were newborns, but it is unclear if the death was one of the newborns.

All the Maryland victims had reported consuming soft or semi-soft Hispanic-style cheese that they purchased at different locations of the same grocery store chain.

Listeria was later detected in a sample of cuajada en terron, or fresh cheese curd, purchased at that chain. The CDC withheld the name of the grocery store, as they often do in investigations.

The illnesses were diagnosed between 
August and November of last year, but the CDC said there may be more. 
The investigation is ongoing, the agency said.

Listeriosis is a foodborne illness caused by Listeria monocytogenes, bacteria found in soil and water. It can be in a variety of raw foods as well as in processed foods and foods made from unpasteurized milk. Listeria is unlike many other germs because it can grow even in the cold temperature of the refrigerator.

Symptoms include fever and chills, headache, upset stomach and vomiting. Treatment is with antibiotics.

Anyone can get the illness. But it is most likely to affect pregnant women and unborn babies, older adults, and people with weak immune systems. To reduce your risk:
