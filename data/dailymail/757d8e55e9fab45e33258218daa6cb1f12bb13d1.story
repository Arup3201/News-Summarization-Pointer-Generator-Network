Despite the recent news that Ryanair had been given approval to offer low-cost flights from Europe to America, it seems that such a project may not be in the works after all.

A statement, issued from Dublin, Ireland, shot down recent speculation about budget flights to the US.

'In light of recent press coverage, the Board of Ryanair Holdings Plc wishes to clarify that it has not considered or approved any transatlantic project and does not intend to do so,' it reads. 

Despite earlier reports that Ryanair was developing low-cost transatlantic flights, the company is now denying such plans

However, it is understood that the ideas of such a transatlantic project is still being explored, but with the intention that Ryanair would not operate the flights.

Instead, any sort of budget Europe to America service, should it come into fruition, would be operated by a sister company under a separate brand.

Earlier this week, it was reported that Ireland-based budget carrier was moving forward on plans to run services between key European cities and the US with one-way tickets costing as little as $15 (£10). 

The news came on the heels of a statement made by Michael O'Leary, the airline's chief executive, last year.

He told the Irish Hotels Federation conference that Ryanair would be offering $15 flights to Boston and New York, but also admitted that passengers would be expected to pay extra for everything from meals to baggage.

Chief executive Michael O'Leary, has said that $15 flights were in development but 'four or five years off'

'Not every seat will be ($15) of course; there will also need to be a very high number of business or premium seats,' he reportedly said. 

He's also said in the past that the company has had a business plan in development for low-fare, transatlantic flights for awhile, but would need to wait until new aircraft could be ordered.

'The difficulty is, I keep cautioning, is that there's no availability of long-haul aircraft for another four or five years.'

It remains to be seen whether or not Ryanair's possible plan will develop further or if a new sister company will emerge.
