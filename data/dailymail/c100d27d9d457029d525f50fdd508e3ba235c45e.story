A jealous ex has been slapped with a restraining order for taking revenge on his former fiancee by posting naked pictures of her on Facebook.

Ben Haddon, 29, uploaded two intimate images of his former partner Lisa Beckett, 29, on the social network site just weeks after they split up in January.

The builder, from Stoke-on-Trent, pleaded guilty to harassment without violence at North Staffordshire Justice Centre yesterday and was issued with an indefinite restraining order, barring him from making contact with Miss Beckett.

Lisa Beckett said she is 'disgusted' by the pictures and claims not to have known they had been taken

He was also ordered to pay £250 in compensation to his ex-partner as well as a £250 fine and £110 costs.

The
 court heard how the father-of-two had kept the x-rated photographs - 
which Miss Beckett claims not to have consented to - from their 14-month
 relationship and used them to humiliate her online.

He
 also tried to get her in trouble at work by claiming she was on drugs 
and even sent threatening text messages and made abusive phone calls.

Haddon texted Miss Beckett on February 4, saying he had uploaded 
pornographic pictures of her on Facebook and was planning to post more.

The court heard how Haddon deleted the photographs minutes later - although Miss Beckett claims they were there for up to an hour - but they had already been seen by Miss Beckett’s friends and family.

Prosecutor Katie Price said: 'Miss Beckett said he was ringing her and threatening her.

'He would ring her place of work to try to get her into trouble by telling them she had taken drugs.

'He said he was going to put things on his Facebook page and he continued to threaten her via text.

'He would also ring her and tell her he was going to blacken her eyes.

'On February 4, Mr Haddon sent a text saying he had uploaded some pornographic pictures and was planning to upload more.

'Miss Beckett was disgusted. The first photograph showed her and the defendant lying together naked on a bed.

'The second photograph was of a similar nature, but a close-up version.

'Miss Beckett claims she did not know these pictures had been taken and that she definitely did not consent to them.'

In a statement read out in court, Miss Beckett added: 'When I found out the photographs had been uploaded I was at work.

'I didn’t eat or sleep for the whole day. I felt terrified of what was coming next. I feel that this has damaged my reputation.

'I never thought Ben would be capable of this.'

The couple had been together for 14-months before the relationship fell apart and the harassment started

Miss Beckett told the court she was shocked Haddon was capable of doing something like posting the pictures

Defending himself in court, Haddon described himself as a 'first-class idiot' and apologised to Miss Beckett.

He
 said: 'I am ashamed of what I have done but I want to make sure that 
you know that she did know these photographs had been taken and she was 
quite willing to have them taken at the time.

'I am a father, and I am disgusted in myself. I have been a first class idiot.

'But I would like to apologise, I am sorry. I hope we can both move on with our lives.'

The court heard the pair had been in a relationship for just over a year before things turned sour in January.

They lived together from June 2013 and Haddon even proposed to her in October, while they were on 
holiday in Wales.

But
 the relationship fell apart in January when he walked out on Miss Beckett 
after his ex-partner started to let him see his two young children.

Haddon apologised but Miss Beckett said it is not enough to make up for what has happened

Miss Beckett,
 a support worker for disabled people, said: 'It was a good 
relationship, he didn’t do anything wrong, it was just normal. We lived 
together since June and we got engaged last October.

'He started getting contact with his children in January and as soon as that happened he just left.

'It just ended but we parted on good terms, I didn’t get an explanation.

'He
 still wanted to see me and didn’t want me to see anybody else but he 
had left the home and left me so I told him he had no right to tell me 
who I was seeing.

'I think jealousy got the better of him and all the harassment started.'

Speaking after the trial, the mother-of-one said: 'I
 had never seen them [the pictures] before and they were disgusting. It 
was intercourse from behind but I didn’t know the phone was there. You 
could see genitals.

'You
 don’t need your mum and dad or colleagues at work seeing that kind of 
thing. I rang the police straight away because I didn’t know what else 
to do.

'An officer came to my home and I had to initial every picture to say it was me, it was humiliating.

'I am happy with the restraining order because I know he would contact me again if it wasn’t for that.

'But I would have been happier if he had been jailed for three months to have time to reflect about what he did.

'He
 hasn’t learnt his lesson, he called himself a first class idiot in 
court but he thinks it’s funny. And this is a man who has a daughter, it
 is absolutely disgusting.

'I don’t think I can ever trust anybody again. The thought that I let this man around my child makes my skin crawl.'
