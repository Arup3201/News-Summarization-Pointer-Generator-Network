These are the two men accused of breaching White House security less than 24 hours apart: an Iraq veteran who allegedly jumped the fence carrying a knife, and a teenager who drove up to the gates and refused to leave.

Omar Gonzalez, 42, was arrested Friday inside the Presidential residence with a knife in his pants after making it over the fence and running across the lawn, the Secret Service said.

And on Saturday afternoon Kevin Carr, 19, was taken in by officers after allegedly driving a car up to a screening point then refusing to leave when he was asked.

Both men are expected to appear in court Monday.

It has since emerged that Gonzalez, from Copperas Cove, Texas, is an Army veteran who served three tours of duty in Iraq, lost part of his foot in an IED blast, and suffers from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.

According to agents who arrested him, Gonzalez said that he was desperate to see the President to warn him about 'the atmosphere collapsing'.

And MailOnline can revealed that Carr, from Shamong, New Jersey, is a college student, whose arrest has bewildered friends and family.

The two attempts to gain entry to the White House prompted the Secret Service to increase security by stepping up patrols around the building. It has been suggested they could set up security checkpoints around the building for the public.

President Obama and his family were not inside the White House when either incident took place.

Obama and two of his daughters had left for Camp David via helicopter just minutes before Gonzalez allegedly rushed the northern entrance.

The Secret Service said that Carr had first approached the White House on foot Saturday afternoon, and left when he was told to.

But, agents claim, he later returned in a white, four-door sedan and drove to a security checkpoint, which he refused to leave. Bomb teams were sent to investigate the vehicle while Carr was arrested.

Tonight friends of Carr described him as an 'intelligent' and 'reasonable' young man who was on vacation in Washington D.C. - and had no reason to attempt to get inside the White House.

One told MailOnline: 'I've know Kevin for three or four years and he is one of the smartest, most reasonable people we know and we are all sure this incident is a misunderstanding.'

Arrested: Kevin Carr, 19 of New Jersey, was arrested after he allegedly refused to leave a restricted area near the White House. A bomb squad was deployed to check his car in the second security scare at the White House in as many days

Another said: 'This was a huge surprise.'

Carr
 has been charged with unauthorized access, among other crimes, the 
Philadelphia Inquirer reported.

Gonzalez has been charged with 
unlawfully entering a restricted building while carrying a 'deadly or 
dangerous weapon'.

Weapon? Gonzalez was allegedly carrying this model of blade - the three-and-a-half-inch Spyderco VG-10 folding knife

A 
former stepson of Gonzalez has said that he is never without his knife -
 a three-and-half-inch folding blade.

Jerry Murphy added that if Gonzalez had wanted to bring more dangerous weapons, he could have.

At
 a hearing late Saturday afternoon in D.C. Superior Court, the assistant
 public defender representing Gonzalez said Gonzalez had no convictions 
or arrest warrants and had tested negative Saturday for drug use, 
according to The Washington Post.

'This
 is someone who has provided service to his country and shown commitment
 in his life,' said the lawyer, Margarita O'Donnell, as she tried 
unsuccessfully to get Gonzalez released.

The
 Army said Gonzalez enlisted in July 1997 and was assigned to the 10th 
Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division, at Fort Hood, 
Texas. At the time, he listed his home as Puerto Rico.

He
 was discharged in September 2003 after completing his service 
obligation. Gonzalez enlisted a second time, in July 2005, and served 
until his retirement in late 2012.

During this period, he was assigned to the 1st Squadron, 14th Cavalry Regiment, at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state, and the 4th Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division at Ford Hood, Texas.

Gonzalez served in Iraq from October 2006 to January 2008.

An unidentified family member said: 'His job was running patrols in Baghdad when his Humvee was hit.'

He added, 'A portion of his foot was amputated - and the evidence is the limp you see in the video of him running across the White House lawn.'

A police affidavit, seen by ABC News, said Gonzalez had a Spyderco VG-10 black folding knife in the front pocket of his pants when he was arrested.

In the wake of his attempt on the White House, the Secret Service announced new, tougher security.

The agency was criticized for not apprehending Gonzalez sooner, and admitted their performance was 'not acceptable,'
 leading to new measures being put in place.

President Obama and his family were not in the White House at the time, but had left just moments before by helicopter.

In a statement, Secret Service officials said: 'The challenge of securing the White House 
complex from security threats is ever present.

'Although last night the 
officers showed tremendous restraint and discipline in dealing with this
 subject, the location of Gonzalez’s arrest is not acceptable.

'In
 addition to the criminal investigation of Gonzalez by the Secret 
Service’s Washington Field Office, Director Julia Pierson immediately 
ordered the Secret Service’s Office of Professional Responsibility to 
conduct a comprehensive after action review of the incident.'

The
 statement continued: 'In the interim, Director Pierson has ordered the 
immediate enhancement of officer patrols and surveillance capabilities 
along the Pennsylvania Avenue fence line around the White House complex.
 These measures went into effect last night.'

President Obama has backed the agency.

A White House spokesman said: 'The president has full confidence in the Secret Service and is grateful to the men and women who day in and day out protect himself, his family and the White House.'

The spokesman did not directly address the issue of the second intruder.

For
 the Secret Service, the breaches were a devastating episode that prompted 
fresh questions about the storied agency and its ability to protect the 
president.

The 
Republican Party's Jason Chaffetz, who chairs the House of 
Representatives' subpanel on national security oversight, called it 
'totally unacceptable' but said the incident was just one of a string of
 security failings on the Secret Service's watch.

'Unfortunately,
 they are failing to do their job,' Chaffetz said. 'These are good men 
and women, but the Secret Service leadership has a lot of questions to 
answer.'

'Was the door open?' he added incredulously.

Experts say Friday's breach was the first time in recent memory that an intruder actually made it inside the White House after hopping the fence. The attempts, however, have been many:

Sept. 11: A 'Pokemon' nut wearing a bright-yellow Pikachu hat was caught walking down the North Lawn seconds after jumping. His motives remain unclear. 

Aug. 7: A presidential address on Iraq was postponed — and the whole place put on lockdown — after a toddler squeezed through the fence on Pennsylvania Avenue, making it onto the lawn. 

June 2013: Joseph Reel, of Ohio, crashed a driverless Jeep into the fence to create a distraction so he could enter and spray paint the White House. He was sentenced to 3 years behind bars.

November 2009: Three people crashed a state dinner for Indian Premier Manmohan Singh. They somehow made it past several security checkpoints and even met President Obama.

2001-2009: Six people jumped the fence — but were all caught almost immediately after landing on the grass. One of them, Brian Patterson, was on his third attempt when he was caught in April 2006

Although
 it is not uncommon for people to make it over the White House fence, 
they're typically stopped almost immediately and rarely get very far.

Video
 from the scene showed the Friday intruder, Gonzalez, sprinting across the lawn as Secret 
Service agents shouted at nearby pedestrians to clear the area.

'This situation was a little different than other incidents we have at the White House,' Donovan said.

'This 
incident 
is the most shocking example yet of how dangerously lax the Secret 
Service has become, failing at its most basic job — to protect the 
president and first family in the White House,' said Washington insider 
Ronald Kessler, who's written several books on the Secret Service.

He added to MailOnline: 'Because of corner cutting and an ingrained cultural attitude by 
management of "we make do with less," the Secret Service is not 
protecting the White House with adequate agents and uniformed officers 
and is not keeping up to date with the latest devices for detecting 
intruders and weapons of mass destruction'

Kessler
 — who revealed the embarrassing scandal about Secret Service agents 
hiring prostitutes in Colombia — said it's 'arrogance' that the White 
House doesn't even have a front door lock. 

'If

 the intruder were carrying chemical, biological or radiological weapons
 and President Obama and his family had been in, we would have had a 
dead president as well as a dead first family,' said Kessler, who 
authored 'The First Family Detail: Secret Service Agents Reveal the 
Hidden Lives of the Presidents.'
