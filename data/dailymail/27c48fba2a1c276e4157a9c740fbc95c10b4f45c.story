Release: Charlie Gilmour leaving prison

Student rioter Charlie Gilmour has claimed prison officers tried to have him murdered by a psychopathic contract killer in jail.

The adopted son of Pink Floyd’s David Gilmour claimed three ‘screws’ locked him in a cell with the assassin, whom they had ordered: ‘Do him in.’ 

Gilmour was jailed for 16 months after tuition fees protests in London spiralled into rioting in December 2010.

He caused outrage by swinging from a flag on the Cenotaph while high on LSD, valium and whisky, before joining a mob which attacked a convoy carrying Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall.

Gilmour, who is reading history at Girton College, Cambridge, was freed after serving just four months of his sentence for violent disorder.

His remarks were denounced by sources close to Justice Secretary Chris Grayling as ‘patently, utterly absurd’. The student, in his mid-20s, does not appear to have mentioned the alleged incident in columns and interviews he has done since his release in November 2011, leading critics to suggest it might not be true.

Gilmour also attacked the Ministry of Justice for seeking to ‘paint prisoners as the violent architects of their own doing’.

In a self-pitying rant, he said threats to his life during his time in HMP Wandsworth – a Category B prison housing some of the most dangerous convicts – had come not ‘from my fellow inmates [but] people in positions of power and responsibility’. He described talking to an inmate, ‘Mack’, who was serving a life sentence for killing people for money.

Gilmour told a Howard League For Penal Reform conference in London last month: ‘There was no doubt he was a contract killer. He was also an incredibly engaging storyteller. So … I didn’t notice the prison officer come into the cell until it was too late.

‘“You’re staying in here, Gilmour,” he said … as he locked us both in. Mack had a history of extreme violence, so was not supposed to share a cell with anyone.’

He added: ‘Mack looked me dead in the eye. “I’ve been asked to do you in … Three screws came to me asking if I’ll do it. Ex-military. Queen and country types. They don’t like what you did and they know what I can do.”’

Gilmour said ‘Mack’ had added: ‘I told them to f*** off. You’re one of us now.’ But the student said that during his time in jail ‘prison officers deliberately placed me in life-threatening situations on several occasions’.

He accused the Ministry of Justice of a ‘deeply cynical propaganda campaign’ blaming inmates for prison violence – even though National Offender Management Service figures show serious assaults on prison officers rose 45 per cent in the two years to 2012.

A Ministry of Justice source said: ‘Claiming that we run some kind of third-world despotic prison system staffed by corrupt thugs who try to get inmates to kill each other is patently, utterly absurd.’

Mr Grayling said: ‘Our staff … are highly professional … they do an incredibly good job in difficult and challenging environments.’
