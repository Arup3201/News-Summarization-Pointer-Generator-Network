Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao’s preparations for the richest fight in ring history is intensifying as the May 2 moves closer.

The fight at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas could smash through the half a billion dollar mark after all money for the fight has been taken in.

And with both fighters in their training camps they are using social media to keep their fans up-to-date in the build up to the mega-fight.

Mayweather was working on his speed in the ring by hitting one of his team wearing a body pad. The undefeated fighter was wearing a black t-shirt with gold writing on the back with his professional record of 47-0 across the top.

The front of the T-Shirt has the letters 'TBE' written in big gold letters, which stand for 'The Best Ever'.  

Pacquiao also posted a video on his Instagram account. His video showed him in various stages of his training, from wrapping his hands, to working in the ring, skipping and working on a speed ball.

The video was also accompanied by a quote adapted from the Bible.

Taken from Corinthians 9: 25-27, the extract read: ‘Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we are imperishable. So I do not run aimlessly; I do not box as one beating the air. But I discipline my body and keep it under control.’

In the short video the PacMan looks in good shape, but it was revealed on Wednesday that the Filipino superstar suffers from such bad leg cramps during training that he spends a staggering $1,800 (£1,205) on a tube of anti-inflammatory cream.
