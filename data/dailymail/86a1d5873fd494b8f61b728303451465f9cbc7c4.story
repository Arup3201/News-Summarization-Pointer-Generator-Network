Chris Grayling today unveiled plans to replace young offender institutions with 'secure colleges'

Young offender institutions will be closed down and replaced with ‘secure colleges’, under radical plans unveiled by Chris Grayling today.

The Justice Secretary will invite private schools to bid to run the new centres, which have been inspired by the Government’s free schools policy.

It raises the prospect of schools such as Eton helping to put tearaways back on the straight and narrow.

Mr Grayling wants teenage criminals to spend their time in custody learning how to read and write and passing exams – not sitting in a cell brooding.

Up to £200,000 a year is spent housing a young burglar or mugger in a young offender institution (YOI) – more than five times the cost of a place at Eton.

Mr Grayling argues this is a waste of money when a staggering three-quarters of inmates reoffend upon release.

He will say today: ‘We cannot go on just doing more of the same, pouring more money into a system which doesn’t work in the hope of a different outcome.

‘That doesn’t make any sense to the taxpayer, or to the young people who we should be trying to get back on the straight and narrow.

‘I want to see new models, perhaps something like secure colleges, providing education in a period of detention, rather than detention with education as an after-thought.

‘I want young people to get the education and skills they need to turn their backs on crime for good.’

The idea of axing YOIs – which have housed notorious inmates such as Jon Venables and Robert Thompson over the years – is likely to prove controversial.

Several YOIs, which are often run by private firms, are coming to the end of their contracts with the Ministry of Justice. This allows them to be closed down and replaced with the ‘secure colleges’.

Private firms, charities and schools will be invited to consider running them, under a Green Paper published today.

It follows the successful policy of allowing parents, charities and other organisations to open free schools.

Eton recently joined the group behind a new state-funded Holyport College free school, near Maidenhead. The school’s 500 pupils will include 225 boarders, costing parents £9,000-12,000 a year, while daytime education will be free.

Max Chambers, head of crime and justice at Policy Exchange, said: ‘Academies are currently transforming some of the toughest schools in the country.

'So it seems like a good idea to apply the principles of those reforms – greater flexibility, a focus on improving pupil discipline and encouraging new providers into the state system – to the education of young offenders.’

But Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: ‘We should never send children to prison to get an education.

'Almost all the children who end up in custody could be dealt with in the community and that is the way to get them back into school, college or training.’
