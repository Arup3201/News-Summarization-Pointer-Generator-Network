One Direction’s entourage has got in trouble with Australian police after allegedly running through three red lights while being pursued by fans in a road-chase.

A spokesman for One Direction has denied the group's convoy ran through red lights in Perth in the early hours of Thursday morning.

He said that the only time the entourage skipped red lights was in Adelaide earlier this week when they were accompanied by Police.

The band’s fans also reportedly drove through red lights in Perth in their desperate attempts to keep up with the band.

The incident is believed to have happened as the group were being driven from Perth airport to the band's city hotel at night.

Fan Ben Blakeley, 22, described the race from the airports as 'epic'. 

Fans: The band have a huge following in Australia and were reportedly chased as they travelled from Perth airport to their hotel  

He told local media: 'It was the whole 
Princess Di thing. Everyone was speeding and running red lights except 
us and one other car because my friend's mum was driving. She was, like,
having a nervous breakdown.'

Six security guards from the band’s vans 
allegedly leaned into fans’ vehicles to photograph drivers and number 
plates with camera phones.

'They were just rude,' said One Direction fan Eve Michele. 'I was shocked by their behaviour.

'That's just not right. They're guests 
in our country and they think they can treat us like this. I'm put off 
trying to meet them ever again.'

A spokesman for One Direction denied the five-car convoy of Hyundai 
had driven through red lights, saying: ‘The only time they have gone 
through red lights is under a police escort and this was done in 
Adelaide.’

He confirmed that the band’s drivers had been concerned about safety due to the rapid road pursuit of the band by fans.

He
said: ‘They did indeed pull over at a petrol station, where upon they 
spoke to the fans explaining concerns about their safety and dangerous 
driving.

‘The convoy 
stopped so that One Direction’s security team could ask fans to obey 
road rules after becoming concerned about their dangerous driving which 
ended in two fans running red lights.

‘The primary focus of the security team is always fan safety,’ he added. 

The boys were given a
ticking off from Police Minister Liza Harvey on Thursday, who said: 
‘Pull your heads in, boys’ - meaning ‘discontinue what you are doing’.

West Australian Police Commissioner Nick Anticich said of the alleged traffic light violations : 'This would be unacceptable behaviour - rock stars or not.

 'If it breaches the law we will deal with every person in the same way. By virtue of the fact that they are rock stars is no licence to break any laws or be any different from anyone else.

'One Direction they may be, but the only direction in relation to this type of offending would be to the courts.'
