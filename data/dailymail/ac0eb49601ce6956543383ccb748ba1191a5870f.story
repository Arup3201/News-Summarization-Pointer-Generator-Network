A letter found in a time capsule that was buried more than a century ago predicted modern flight and video communication that would allow us to see the face of who we were talking to

The note written by George A. Litchfield, the business manager of the Boston Traveler, in 1901 was dug up along with a number of other historic items in the city's Old State House last week.

In it he describes his visions of the future that included adventures in flight, exploration, and communication.

Prediction: The note written by George A. Litchfield, the business manager of the Boston Traveler, in 1901 was dug up in the city's Old State House last week

He said that man would be able to fly able to with leisure and without cumbersome machinery.

However some of his estimations were wrong as, according to the Boston Globe, he said we would be connecting with people in 'distant worlds' by the middle of the 20th Century.

Litchfield wrote: 'Before the midway of the century shall have been reached distant worlds will be communicating with us, and we shall know the mysteries of the spheres.

'We shall fly; not merely navigate the air with cumbersome machinery sustained by bags of gas, but we shall step from our houses, and at our convenience or pleasure [fly]'.

He also predicted that humans would be talking via video, long before Skype and Apple's FaceTime. and guessed that steam power would decline. 

Historic items: A piece of wood with the hand written description: 'Wood removed from the Old Lion age of same 21 years in 1900' is displayed after it was taken from a 1901 time capsule

'Long before it completes its cycle, steam will have given place to other motive power not yet discovered,' he added.

'We shall speak around the world. We shall see the face of him with whom we talk.' 

The capsule was removed last week from the head of lion statue that has long stood guard over the Old State House.

The Bostonian Society, which oversees the historic building, released an inventory of the items Wednesday.

The presence of a red hardcover book, with no visible title, surprised the organization because it had not been included on a list discovered by an ancestor of a man who worked on the statue, nor was it referenced in a recently-uncovered 1901 newspaper article about the time capsule.
