A single tear rolls down her face as she hesitatingly explains what 'those men' made her do.

The 12-year-old girl is just one of 100,000 children estimated to work in the terrifying sex trade of the Philippines where virginity is sold for $250 to foreign men.

Although the tales she tells are horrifying, in many ways this child is lucky - she is one of 15,000 young girls saved by anti-trafficking 
organisation Visayan Forum.

Horrifying: A single tear rolls down her face as she hesitatingly explains what 'those men' made her do. The 12-year-old is just one of 100,000 children are estimated to work in the terrifying sex trade of the Philippines where virginity is sold for $250 to foreign men

Harrowing: In the documentary Cecilia takes the camera crew to a safe house in an undisclosed location. Three 12-year-old girls explain their harrowing plight at the hands of the sex traffickers

Set up by Philippine human rights pioneer Cecilia Flores-Oeband in 1991, the charity managed to recruit Philippines' biggest star, Manny Pacquiao, to join them as a fighter in the battle against modern-day slavery, reports CNN's Freedom Project.

Manila, the capital of the Philippines has a booming sex trade and money is passed between adult prostitutes and punters freely.

But there are also thousands of young children who are forced to work the streets.

Outreach: Cecilia and Visayan Forum run halfway houses for girls all over the country, four support centres for domestic workers and one safe house, a home for those worst affected

Cause: Cecilia blames part of the problem on sex tourists who visit the area to pick up prostitutes

Cecilia blames part of the problem on sex tourists who visit the area to pick up prostitutes.

'If no Westerners go to that area there is no business for this in the Philippines,' explains Cecilia.

In the CNN documentary titled The Fighters, Cecilia is seen talking to Maria, a young girl who had been forced into the trade,

By the time she turned 15, several dozen men had paid to rape her.

'She was told she was going to a restaurant but when she arrived it was a house with 16 girls staying on the second floor,' explains Cecilia.

Some of the sex slave prisoners were younger than Maria at just 13 or 14-years-old.

The girls in the house which doubled as a brothel were forced to serve 14 customers per day and virgins provided large cash injections for the sex traffickers.

Saved: A raid lead to rescue of 30 Filipino girls who were reportedly on the way to be trafficked to Syria. The picture is taken at the police station where girls were brought for investigation after the rescue

'They
are some that actually ask for virgins' explains Cecile.

Visayan Forum raided the house and managed to recover 'around 23 more girls.'

The brothel owner and Maria's recruiter were taken to court, but the judge dismissed the case.

Cecilia and Visayan Forum run halfway houses for girls all over the country, four support centres for domestic workers and one safe house, a home for those worst affected.

In the documentary Cecilia takes the camera crew to a safe house in an undisclosed location.

It houses thirty girls whose ages range from 12-20 years old.

'If you could live off love, the center of hope would be a palace,' explains Cecilia.

But Cecilia explains that the charity is in desperate need of furniture, food and medicine - she said that some of the girls suffer from STDS.

Star boost: In February 2012, Pacquiao delivered a speech to congress in which he outlined the necessity to stop human trafficking

Helping out: Pacquiao has lent his name and his vision to become an ambassador for the poor

At the safe house three 12-year-old girls explain their harrowing plight at the hands of the sex traffickers. 

Although they are now being looked after the damage is evident - one of them wakes up in the night screaming in fear in case the traffickers find her.

Another one of them continually vomits without warning - a psychologist told the charity it is a physiological reaction as she remembers what she was asked to do by the sex traffickers.

They had been forced to perform sexual acts in a video chat room for a number of foreign men.

As they tell the camera crew their horrifying stories - one of the children covered her ears in shame.

Some of the men - who they say were American - demanded they perform sexual acts with men pulled off the street, drink their own urine and other even more degrading acts. 

The girls have subsequently developed a fear of American men and label them as 'maniacs.'

Although the battle is long, there is hope for the future. 

Haven: 'If you could live off love, the center of hope would be a palace,' explains Cecilia about the safe house

Pacquiao has lent his name and his vision to becoming an ambassador for the poor.

In February 2012, Pacquiao delivered a speech to congress in which he outlined the necessity to stop human trafficking.

'During my visit to the Visayan Forum I talked to children as young as 9-years-old who are trafficked for prostitution,' Pacquiao told Congress.

'As politicians, we need to be true to our words and actions. We need to send a clear message; that Filipinos are not for sale.'

And it seems his drive is working - a few months ago Philippines's President Benigno Aquino III, signed the Anti-Trafficking bill Pacquiao had been championing, into law.

'A few years from now I might not be in boxing anymore but my fight is to continue to support Cecile and the Visayan Forum to stop human trafficking,' explains Pacquiao.
