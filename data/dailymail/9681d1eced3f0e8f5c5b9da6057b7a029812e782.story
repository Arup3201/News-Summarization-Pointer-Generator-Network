Lewis Hamilton's voice came over the radio in a panting rasp as he sat inside the cockpit of his  crippled Mercedes after a 165mph crash that bruised not only knees, ankles and back but his world  championship dream.

‘I put my foot on the pedal and something failed,’ he wheezed, seemingly winded by the impact during qualifying for today’s  German Grand Prix.

It was at Sachs Kurve, the 13th corner at Hockenheim, that a broken disc in his front right wheel sent  his car careering across the gravel and sideways into the tyre wall.

He had 
completed just five laps, condemning him to 16th place, and possibly to 
starting in the pit lane once his car has been restored, when he should 
have contested pole.

His
 only true rival for the prime front-row position was Mercedes team-mate
 Nico Rosberg, who ended up setting the fastest time of the day by 
sixth-tenths of a second. Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa, both of 
Williams, start second and third.

Hamilton
 was taken to the medical centre for tests while his car was lifted by 
hoist onto a truck and covered in a black cloth, his hopes of narrowing 
the four-point deficit to Rosberg at the top of the drivers’ standings 
badly damaged.

At
 the paddock, Hamilton said: ‘Nico has basically got another gift, but 
we will see what we can do tomorrow.’ ‘Why always me?’ he might have 
added, a la Mario Balotelli.

The
 hard fact is that Rosberg has out-qualified Hamilton 6-4, an 
extraordinary statistic given the Briton’s reputation as a one-lap 
specialist.

However,
 there is no evidence to underpin the Twitter morons claiming within 
minutes of the accident that Hamilton is suffering at the hands of 
pro-German saboteurs in the team.

The
 conspiracy theorists might consider whether Niki Lauda, the Mercedes 
chairman, brought Hamilton in at great expense to help them win the 
title only to bring him down.

This
 was Hamilton’s second technical misfortune of the season. The other was
 an engine failure in Melbourne. Rosberg has suffered one, a gearbox 
problem at Silverstone a fortnight ago. (Although Hamilton retired from 
the Canadian Grand Prix, that was partly because he failed to manage 
overheating brakes as well as Rosberg, who, despite being plagued by the
 same affliction, nursed his car through to second place.)

Rosberg
 waved his black and turquoise glove at the thinly-populated stands as 
he turned into the pits on this scorching day in the Eichelgarten woods.
 He was happy to have taken pole in front of his home fans, but not as 
ecstatic as he has been on other such occasions.

‘I
 would have preferred it if it was an open fight with Lewis,’ said the 
German. While sitting at his press conference, he watched Hamilton’s 
crash for the first time on the TV. ‘It looked pretty bad, but I believe
 he is just a little bit bruised,’ said Rosberg, who also explained that
 he uses different front brake discs from Hamilton (Brembo rather than 
Carbon Industrie, since you ask).

He
 was asked by a Finnish journalist whether he was half of the first 
all-Finnish front row. His father is Finland’s 1982 world champion Keke 
Rosberg, though he competes under the flag of his mother, Sina. ‘Yes, I 
agree,’ he smiled. He later changed his mind, saying: ‘I am half Finnish
 so there are one-and-a-half Finns on the podium and that is a record, 
too.’

Hamilton
 was understandably less jovial, but no less determined. ‘It wasn’t a 
great feeling when that happened, you just have to take your hands off 
the wheel and brace for the impact. I have felt better, but thankfully 
I’m OK,’ he said. ‘We didn’t even get to do five laps. I’m not sure 
where we’ll start tomorrow in the race because that will depend on the 
damage to the car. But we’ll give it everything, hope for a slice of 
luck and aim for a recovery . . . I won’t be giving up.’

Elsewhere
 Jenson Button (11th)  was outgunned by his McLaren team-mate Kevin 
Magnussen (fourth) while Daniel Ricciardo (fifth) beat Red Bull 
team-mate Sebastian Vettel for the seventh time in qualifying.

Hamilton
 will have to summon all his spirit as a born racer and probably needs 
to rely on Rosberg suffering a glitch if he is to win.

‘You’d have to be smoking something to think I can beat Nico,’ he said, smiling thinly.
