A Florida police officer wore his uniform to become one of Florida's first married gay couples.

Detective David Currie, 50, and his now-husband Aaron Woodard, 33, tied the knot shortly after midnight on Tuesday, when the state legalized gay marriage.

And after requesting permission from his superiors, Currie walked down the registry aisle with full support of the Broward County Sheriff's to wed in uniform.

'It's a really great feeling,' Currie told the Miami Herald.

'I think about how I did an amazing thing last night. 

'I'm very excited, not only for me personally but for what it means for state of Florida, for people who have careers like mine where being gay is not that cool… it's not easily acceptable.'

'When straight couples get married in the military they wear their uniforms and he and asked me if I would wear mine,' said Currie. 

'I said I would need to find out if it's proper.'

Landmark ruling: On Tuesday at midnight, Florida legalized gay marriage, prompting unions across the state

Scott Israel, Borward County Sheriff, said he didn't think twice.

He said: 'I felt if he was going to have the milestone night of his nights and if he was proud enough of the agency to wear the uniform then I certainly felt that it would be a great thing and wanted to allow him to wear the uniform at a very important night in his life,'

The couple, who met through mutual friends in Fort Lauderdale a year ago, a foster-parent certified and plan to raise children.
