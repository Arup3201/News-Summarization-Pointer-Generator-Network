While caviar, velvet and even feather manicures may have been hot beauty news last season, 2013 is all about denim nail polish.

The denim effect polish is the latest creation from nail masterminds Nails Inc and while it doesn't launch until next month, the buzz surrounding the latest beauty product is already huge.

The Bling It On Denim and Studs polish is £19 and the matt indigo varnish applies glossy and dries down to a classic denim effect finish.

It's all about the denim: While caviar and feather manicures made their mark last season, as Poppy Delevingne proves, this season is all about denim nails

For those who like to experiment with their beauty regime, the collection is packed with mini silver and gold stud stars that will personalise the look.

Poppy Delevingne, face (and nails) of Nails Inc looks effortlessly cool in full denim attire as she showcases the latest nail trend in the campaign shots.

Sam Heath, Nails Inc marketing manager said: ‘Our Denim polish is stunning – it’s a classic indigo shade with a matte denim finish. 

'It suits all skin tones and we predict it will be an absolute must-have for summer.

'Next up for nails is embellishment. Nails inc has designed press on nails embellished with real Swarovski crystals called Bling it on Crystaltastic nails and there are four designs to choose from.’ 

Beauty blogger and Heart FM presenter Nicola Bonn added: 'Following the leather trend, denim nails are big news.

'It's a fun look that has been inspired by Chanel and will be everywhere this Spring.

'I'll be channeling the 80's by accessorising mine with studs.'

From Ashish to Rihanna for River Island, denim was hot on the catwalks this season giving fashion a real urban edge and once again, Nails Inc are ahead of the game in beauty trends.
