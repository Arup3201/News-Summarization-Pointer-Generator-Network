Andrew 'Freddie' Flintoff, 36, pictured at a separate speeding hearing in June, escaped a driving ban after being caught doing 87mph on a motorway

Cricketer Andrew ‘Freddie’ Flintoff yesterday escaped a driving ban for speeding at 87mph by claiming it would cause ‘exceptional hardship’.

The former England captain argued that disqualification would hurt those who rely on his charity work – and damage his TV career.

Flintoff, 36, was clocked speeding in his £150,000 Bentley in January and already had nine points on his driving licence for three other offences.

Another three would have led to an automatic driving ban – usually six months – under the totting-up process.

But magistrates accepted that keeping him off the roads would affect the recipients of his extensive fundraising work as well as the privacy of his three children.

Instead the former England all-rounder, who has now been caught speeding four times in the past three years, was fined £330 and handed three penalty points but was told he could continue to drive.

Last night road safety campaigners condemned the leniency shown by magistrates and called for ‘irresponsible driving’ to be properly punished. Flintoff was doing 87mph when he was clocked by a speed camera on the M6 near Linstock, Cumbria, the court heard.

He was previously caught speeding in August 2011, June 2012 and June this year.

Michael Neofytou, defending, told magistrates in Carlisle of his client’s ‘illustrious’ cricket career for Lancashire and England and his MBE after the Ashes win in 2005. But he also described how a ban would harm Flintoff’s charity and TV work – as the cricketer is due to be in Northern Ireland today filming a show in which he goes on a road trip with a fish and chip van powered by its own cooking fat.

Mr Neofytou added: ‘What’s much less publicised about him and less well known is what he does off the pitch. This is really one of the stronger arguments for exceptional hardship, what he does off the radar, for those less fortunate than himself.’

The court heard he and his wife Rachael, 36, run the AF Foundation, a children’s charity the star set up in 2007. JPs were told he helped to raise £800,000 for Alder Hey Children’s Hospital in Liverpool and was attempting to increase the amount to £1million.

‘He’s constantly raising money, or trying to when not in his professional role,’ said Mr Neofytou. ‘He’s very much a Lancashire lad – he’s never got above himself.’

Flintoff also drives himself to charity speaking events, matches and auctions of cricket memorabilia and ‘never takes a fee’, he added. He and his wife juggle the running of their charity while looking after their three children – two boys and a girl aged nine, eight and six, the court heard.

The 36-year-old millionaire, who is now a panellist on Sky One show League Of Their Own, was already on nine points for speeding and in danger of an automatic ban after he was caught doing 87mph in his Bentley on the M6, near Linstock, Cumbria on January 28 this year

The cricketer often drove them to school and various activities and sports meetings with their ‘games kits and hockey sticks’.

Mr Neofytou added: ‘We invite you to consider the hardship on them if he was disqualified from driving.’

Chairman
 of the bench David Johnson accepted the argument and also ordered 
Flintoff to pay £85 court costs and £30 victim impact surcharge.

He 
added: ‘Because of your position, the fact that you are well known, 
clearly the impact has to be on others, more than you yourself.’

He
 said there would be a ‘potential question mark over the privacy’ of his
 children if he was not able to drive them and it would affect his 
ability to make personal appearances at charity events across the 
country.

But Flintoff was warned not to use the same reasons in court if
 he is caught speeding again in the next three years.

Last night the sportsman, who came out of retirement from cricket this year, was invited to work with road safety campaigners.

Gary
 Rae of Brake said: ‘Mr Flintoff now joins thousands of others who have 
12 points or more on their licence, but who are still allowed to get 
behind the wheel.

‘We’re very clear about this: if you have 12 points or more on your licence, you should lose that licence for a period of time.’

Flintoff
 made a return to professional cricket last week, appearing for 
Lancashire at the Natwest T20 Blast final against Birmingham Bears at 
Edgbaston last Saturday

During his career, Andrew Flintoff was consistently regarded as one of the world's best players.

He played 79 tests for England  is the country's third-highest wicket taker in One Day Internationals, with 168, and is only one of 17 players to be on both the batting and bowling honours boards at Lords Cricket Ground.

The 36-year-old made his debut in 1998 against South Africa, but in the early stages, the management said they weren't happy with his fitness and weight.

He responded in 2000 by scoring 42 not out in a one day game against Zimbabwe at Old Trafford. 

As he collected his Man of the Match award, he told an interviewer: 'Not bad for a fat lad.'

The all-rounder was crucial to England victories in the Ashes series in 2005 - in which he was named 'man of the series' - and 2009.

During the Second Test of the 2005 series he broke Ian Botham's 1981 record of six sixes in an Ashes Test Match with five in the first innings, and a further four in the second innings.

In 2007 the father-of-three's off-the-field antics caught national media attention following the infamous 'Fredalo' incident. 

He was forced into an apology after he drunkenly tried to board a pedalo in the early hours of the morning in St Lucia during the World Cup. He fell into the surrounding water and had to be rescued.

He was suspended for one game and stripped of the vice-captaincy.

In 2009, he announced he would be stepping down from international cricket after being 'plagued' with injuries. His finale was beating Australia at the Oval to win an Ashes series.
