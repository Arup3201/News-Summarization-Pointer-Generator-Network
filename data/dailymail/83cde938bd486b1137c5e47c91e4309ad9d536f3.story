A father and daughter who lived in squalor surrounded by rabbits, dogs and budgies have been banned from keeping animals for just two years.

The home of Paul and Carol Farnsworth in Salford, Greater Manchester, made RSPCA inspectors' 'eyes water' as they walked in.

Inside they found eight alive rabbits and three dead ones, seven dogs and a puppy, two budgies and a cat.

Cruel: One of the dogs, called Gizmo, would was found living in the home of Paul and Carol Farnsworth. RSCPA staff found scores of other maltreated animals including rabbits and budgies

Squalor: The filfthy interior of the house where father and daughter Paul and Carol Farnsworth lived with 20 dead or dying animals

The animals, plus a black Shetland pony called Merlin who was kept at the farm area in Heaton Park, Greater Manchester, were taken away from the family and are now in RSPCA care.

Paul, 61, and Carol, 24, pleaded guilty to failing to ensure the needs of animals were met and causing unnecessary suffering to an animal at Bury Magistrates Court.

They were banned from keeping animals for two years.

The court was told the RSPCA was called to reports of a 'dull and depressed' pony with a hoof condition at Heaton Park in June 2012.

Anna McDonald, prosecuting, said police and staff from the organisation visited the house six months later after reports someone had been bitten by a dog.

Ban: Paul and Carol Farnsworth. The two were given six-month community rehabilitation orders and banned from keeping animals for two years

She said: 'As soon as the door opened the inspectors could smell a foul odour coming from inside the property.

'The house was in a filthy state and the smell of faeces and ammonia was so extreme that it made the inspectors' eyes water and their breathing became uncomfortable.

'Floors were 'littered' with rabbit faeces, two budgies were in a 'small, dirty' cage and the bodies of a white rabbit and two other rabbits were found on a wheelie bin.

'Dogs described as "matted and dirty" were also discovered.'

A vet confirmed the animals 'were at risk' due to the conditions and a German shepherd called Simba was later put down.

The Farnsworths were sentenced to six-month community rehabilitation orders and banned from keeping any animals for two years.

No evidence was offered with regard to Linda Farnsworth, 56, who also lived in the house.

Asim Ali, defending, said: 'There is no intention for them to purchase, control or look after any animals again.'
