The pilot of one of the Wisconsin planes that collided at 12,000 feet - almost killing a group of skydivers - has recounted his death-defying leap from the burning Cessna and shared the selfie he took of his bloody face after he landed.

Matt Fandler was at the controls of one of two single-engine planes that were flying over Superior, Wisconsin, last Saturday with a group of experienced skydivers who were making their last jump of the day.

But what was supposed to be a moment of perfectly-timed
 air acrobatics and exhilarating free-falls turned into a terrifying 
jump-for-your-life situation when Fandler's Cessna suddenly sandwiched on top 
of the other.

Speaking about the moment he said: 'And all of a sudden I hear this loud bang. I didn't see 
anything...I just heard a bang and the windshield immediately 
shattered.'

Bloody: After Fandler landed safely on the ground, he took a 'selfie' to document his injuries, his face covered in blood from where the windshield shattered in his face after the planes collided

Survivor: Matt Fandler was at the controls of one of two single-engine planes that were flying over Superior, Wisconsin, and tells Matt Lauer for NBC's Dateline about his death-defying leap

The crash tore off the wing of the plane and the gas tank blew up underneath and caught fire, causing the plane to go into an 'uncontrolled descent'.

'I was staring straight ahead. And the first thing I remember thinking 
is that I need to regain control of this airplane,' the 23-year-old told Matt Lauer 
in an exclusive Dateline interview airing tonight at 8pm.

'And I 
immediately pulled the yoke back to my chest and pulled it back as far 
as I possibly could. And there was no reaction from the airplane.

'I began to pick up more and more airspeed. And I realize that I have no
 control of this aircraft. And probably thought it was in my best 
interest to not be in this aircraft.'

Fortunately he was wearing a parachute and though he had only done two tandem jumps before, he had to recall everything he learned as he jumped head first from the gap where the wing used to be.

He got himself into the proper arched position for a free fall and 
withstood the temptation to open the chute immediately, waiting until he
 was at the recommended 4,000 to 5,000 feet, NBC reports.

He landed hard somewhere near the runway and somersaulted to a stop.

When he realized he was OK he decided to take a picture of himself to document his injuries. Had he not, then the 23-year-old would not have believed he had done what he did, he reveals on the Dateline special.

Impact: The skydivers were perched on the edge of the plane ready to jump as the other one hit, causing a massive fire bomb

Impact: This is the moment the two planes hit, sending divers who were preparing to jump flying out of the aircraft and causing the wing of the other to come off

Incredible: Five of the skydivers involved in the Wisconsin plane crash can be seen freefalling and the plane Matt Fandler was flying on flames and hurtling to the ground

The photo shows his face covered in blood from the shards of 
glass that flew at him when the Cessna's windshield shattered on impact.

He also had serious cuts on his hands not seen in the picture that took 25 stitches to repair.

'I didn't have a mirror or anything, so I asked the police officer if he
 wanted to take a photo of me,' he told NBC's Dateline.

'He gave me a really weird look, so I decided to take it myself.'

When he saw the other pilot safely land his plane and then each skydiver parachute to the ground unhurt, he called it a miracle.

And just like the others said the whole terrifying experience has not put them off skydiving, Fandler says he also plans to get back into the air, with the goal of one day flying bigger and faster planes.

'I really feel confident in my ability to be safe as a pilot. And I know what I can control. And I know what I cannot control,' he said.

Amy Olson, left, remembers the pilot screaming at them to 'Go!', ordering them to jump. 'That's probably the worst, was hearing him scream,' she said through tears. 'It's pretty raw.'

Brave: This skydiver describes how me made his way over to the plane that was on fire (while free falling) to see if the pilot was OK

Calm under pressure: Blake the pilot describes flying his plane after the collision and landing it safely which, they joked, was one of his better landings

One of the skydivers Barry Sinnex told Matt Lauer on the Today show this week that he tried to chase Fandler's plane that was on fire as he was free-falling to see if the pilot was OK.

When he saw him jump from the plane, he chased him to make sure he could open his chute.

'Everybody else had parachutes on, so they were kind of on their own, so I chased the plane. I think Dan did too, he came down with me,' he said.

'We chased the airplane to see if the pilot got out. Once I saw the pilot bail out, I made sure he was going to open the parachute because he was a student.'

Patricia Roy said: 'I thought it was a joke at first. Obviously not a very funny or appropriate one. But it was all so surreal.

'I thought oh my God they're getting closer. I expected the other plane to move away.'

Daniel Chandler, who became wedged in between the two planes and almost collided with the propeller said: 'It was unpleasant. I had no time to react....The sound 
behind me, I'll never forget.

'And that's all I could do was try and stay
 forward and try not to move because I knew I was going to live where I 
was, or thought I could.'

Amy Olsen could not contain her 
emotions while recounting the collision. Through tears she said she 
remembers the pilot screaming at them 'Go!', ordering them to jump.

'That's probably the worst, was hearing him scream. It's pretty raw.'

Blake Weldan, who managed to fly one of the planes to safety and land perfectly at Richard I. Bong Airport in Douglas County, joked that it was one of his better landings and said he has no idea how the crash occurred.

'Everything was as it should have been,' he said.

'We were just kind of lucky that we were at the point where we were out of the airplane,' said 64-year-old flight instructor Mike Robinson, who was in the lead plane.

'If we'd been back in the rear of the airplane when they collided it might have been a little bit different.'

Once out of the plane, the skydivers had to carefully maneuver their chutes to stay out of the path of raining debris.

'We're
 in free fall, so we're falling about 120 miles miles an hour vertically
 down,' Mr Robinson said. 'But then we open our parachutes, and now all 
of a sudden they're falling faster than we are...Fortunately, everybody 
kept it together so they just avoided (the debris).'

Split apart: Both wings of the lead plane became detached and Robinson said he watched it crash to the ground in three pieces

Falling pieces: Several people in the Superior area reported seeing the plane falling to the ground but no one was injured by the debris

Miraculously, no one on the ground was injured by the falling wreckage - but plenty saw them crash to the ground.

Mike Plaunt lives in the area and often hears and sees the skydivers, but he noticed something was off about yesterday's jump.

'I
 went outside and looked and could see parachuters and a drop plane, and
 then there was something spiraling down. I couldn't identify what it 
was..it had a trail of smoke and I had never seen that before,' he said.

Happy to be alive: Two people hug after all 11 aboard the two planes landed safely

Quick thinking: The pilot of the tracking plane was able to land it safely, but the lead plane was not so lucky. It crashed to the ground in several piece. The pilot of that airplane escaped by parachute as well

While
 Mr Robinson still doesn't know why exactly the two planes collided, he 
believes the lead plane may have created unstable air for the tracking 
plane.

The Federal Aviation Administration will investigate the crash today.

It's
 still uncertain what will happen to the skydiving company, since they 
only owned the two planes. But it is the end of their season anyway.

Mr
 Robinson says the crash yesterday happened during the fourth jump of 
his day, and that he's done over 900 jumps in his lifetime.

'I'll remember this one more than most,' he said.
