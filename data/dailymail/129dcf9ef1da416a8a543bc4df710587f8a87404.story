These days, it’s known as the quintessential Irish drink and is a firm favourite in British pubs. But Guinness almost faced a very different fate – as the tipple of choice for Nazi Germany.

These draft posters, found by former brewer David Hughes and dating back to 1936, reveal the firm’s planned advertising campaign for the Third Reich.

Drawn by John Gilroy, who produced most of the company's classic advertising, the collection was produced in 1936, the same year as the Berlin Olympics.

One picture features a Wehrmacht soldier holding a pint with the caption, 'It's time for a Guinness'

The images, which were never used, 
include a smiling German soldier holding a pint of stout with the slogan
 ‘It is time – for a Guinness’.

'It's time for a Guinness', while another features toucans with beer 
glasses balanced on their beaks flying above the Olympic stadium which 
is draped in Swastika flags.

The paintings are all originals, made using oil on canvas, and would have been used to mass-produce poster copies, but were never actually used.

The images, which are now thought to be worth £1.2million, feature in a new book, Gilroy Was Good For Guinness, written by former Guinness brewer David Hughes.

In the book is a memo from executives at the drink maker to SH Benson, their longtime advertising partner, which shows that the Irish and London offices did not agree on the campaign.

It says: 'Dear John. Another hot potato, I'm afraid. This one comes from St James's Gate [Guinness's Dublin headquarters], who are busy wooing an importer in Berlin.

Guinness drew up advertising posters in 1936 designed for Nazi Germany but they were never used

Speaking to the Sunday Times, Hughes said he believes it is unlikely that Guinness, SH Benson and Gilroy were aware of the true horrors of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime.

He said: 'In 1936, people were a bit naïve about Nazi symbolism and what it came to mean.

'People were starting to believe the Germans were dangerous. Guinness in London did not favour getting into the German market but in Ireland there was a somewhat ambivalent attitude towards Nazi Germany.'
