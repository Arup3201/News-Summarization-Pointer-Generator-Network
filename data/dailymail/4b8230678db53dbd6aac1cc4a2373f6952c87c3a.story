A football manager who was in a coma following an horrific car crash only woke up after hearing his team had won its opening game.

Wayne Thorne, 33, suffered a catalogue of horrific injuries when he was involved in a head-on collision on his way home from work.

He underwent a number of operations - including major heart surgery - before doctors placed him in a coma.

Intensive 
care nurses told his devastated family to keep talking to him in a bid 
to bring him around.

Mr Thorne had been in the coma for a week when wife Mandy, 32, and brother Gary were gently speaking to him last Saturday.

During the chat they told him his Larkhall Athletic side had won their first game of the season in the Western Football League Premier Division.

Seconds later football-mad Mr Thorne  opened his eyes for the first time to the amazement of his family.

His relieved wife said: 'Football and sport and being active, that has been his life, so when he was in his coma we were told to talk to him.

'On the first Saturday Larkhall had a game and me and his brother told him the score and he opened his eyes.

'I know studies have shown that they can hear you and me and his brother truly believe he heard us.

'It was brilliant to see, because he absolutely loves his football and is so dedicated to Larkhall Athletic.'

Mr Thorne, of Swindon, Wiltshire, was travelling home from his job as a kitchen fitter two weeks ago when he was involved in the head-on collision.

He was taken to the trauma unit at Frenchay Hospital, Bristol, where doctors discovered the catalogue of injuries he had sustained.

He
had suffered a ruptured artery, sixteen crushed ribs, punctured lung, 
broken sternum, dislocated hip, shattered pelvis and fractured leg in 
the crash.

Mrs Thorne said: 'We were told he was very lucky to be alive because of the force of the impact and the fact it had ruptured his main artery.'

Mr Thorne's rib cage has now been wired together, so he will be bed-bound for six weeks, but it is hoped he will be well enough to be transferred to a hospital nearer home soon.

Mr Thorne, who played for Chippenham Town FC, had just started his second season in charge at Larkhall Athletic.

He woke up to hear they had come back from a 3-1 deficit to win 4-3 away against Bridport on August 10.

He thanked the fans who had supported them through the last few weeks.

'I have been overwhelmed by the best wishes not only from all at Larkhall football club but by all of the clubs and people related to the football world across the South West,' he said.

'It has helped me put it into perspective and it shows me when you need people they are there.

'I will in time be thanking all these people individually but the road I face in recovery is quite a long one but I will get there.

'All my love and respect goes out to every part of my family who over the last two weeks have been put through hell, waiting for me through operations and results and being by my bedside every day.'

Larkhall Athletic FC chairman Paul Rankin said Wayne had been a driving force behind the clubâ€™s success and everyone was looking forward to seeing him back soon.

He said: 'Clearly the club are behind Wayne, we are doing everything we can to support the family. We look forward to seeing him back here at some point in the next few months.'
