Food Network chef Giada de Laurentiis stays thin by secretly spitting out the food she cooks while filming into a 'dump bucket', a source on the program has claimed

Ms de Laurentiis has previously said she maintains her size 2 figure by eating in moderation

She told health.com: 'I eat a little bit of everything and not a lot of anything. Everything in moderation. 

'I know that's really hard for people to understand, but I grew up in an Italian family where we didn't overdo anything. We ate pasta, yes, but not a lot of it. Pasta doesn't make you fat. How much pasta you eat makes you fat.'

But a source on her show told the New York Post's PageSix that while filming Ms de Laurentiis 'never eats'.

The source said: 'When she is making drinks and food that she has to drink or eat, they have a dump bucket that is brought out the second they cut.' 

Ms de Laurentiis is then said to spit out the food, before filming resumes.

A representative for Ms de Laurentiis said she 'absolutely' eats the food that she cooks but because of the number of times scenes that are shot, she doesn't always 'eat and shallow every time'

The source explained that sometimes an assistant was used to 'take the bite' of food if something needed to look like she had tried it, saying 'she does not eat at all while filming' 

Stephen Huvane, who represents Ms de Laurentiis, called the claims 'absurd and completely false'.

He said the chef 'absolutely' eats her own food while filming but because scenes were often shot multiple times 'she doesn't always eat and swallow every time'.

Mr Huvane said if his client ate everything she cooked 'that would be like eating six to eight meals a day'.
