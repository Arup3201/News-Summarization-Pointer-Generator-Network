Chelsea’s players have been warned they will receive a verbal lashing from Derby County captain Richard Keogh if any of them try diving to win a penalty.

Keogh witnessed the Chelsea performance branded ‘Swan Lake’ by Hull manager Steve Bruce and is not afraid to deliver personal rebukes to offenders.

Head coach Steve McClaren also added his voice to the debate, calling for the FA to take retrospective action on simulation. It is a crime, he believes, on par with red-card tackles because ‘it can cost you the game’.

Chelsea travel to the iPro Stadium for Tuesday’s Capital One Cup quarter-final on the back of stinging criticism from Bruce, who was infuriated when Gary Cahill escaped a second yellow card for a tumble in the box.

The match at Stamford Bridge saw Diego Costa and Willian booked for diving by referee Chris Foy and it is an issue Derby are familiar with as far as Chelsea are concerned.

The two teams met in January for an FA Cup third round tie and Ramires received a yellow card for simulation from Andre Marriner.

Earlier this season when Callum McManaman went down in the area, Keogh stood over the Wigan winger to administer a firm censure. Expect the Derby defender to do the same to Chelsea’s stellar collection of talents.

‘I stick up for my team-mates, I stick up for the club,’ said Keogh. ‘McManaman went over quite easy in the box and I let him know it wasn’t acceptable. As a player it is quite frustrating.

‘Players are going to do it unless their manager stamps it out. It will be a touchy subject for as long as it carries on. You don’t want fellow professionals to cheat.

'I don’t know if cheat is the right word, it is one of those things that happens in football that we want to see less of.

Steve McLaren wants diving incidents which go unnoticed to be investigated by authorities afterwards

‘The referee is the key to it. He has to be strong. It is such a tough decision because the pace of the game means things happen so quickly. Players can’t argue if they have blatantly dived and get booked — it is not right.’

McClaren wants diving incidents that go undetected to be studied by authorities afterwards.

‘If people cheat and do wrong, they have to suffer the consequences, we’ve all had to do that,’ he said. ‘(Video analysis) should be (used), they do it in other things so why not for diving or simulation?

‘It keeps getting mentioned for years now and still nothing’s been done. It’s in our game and it needs to be stamped out. We try to do it as managers and coaches, but it’s up to referees and the authorities to take the action we can’t take.’

McClaren coaches his defenders about the perils of going to ground in the box. ‘It’s what we call the red zone. It’s danger! Don’t give the opponent the opportunity to fall over or catch your foot.’

Ultimately McClaren hopes the match will be decided without controversy. He believes Chelsea have improved hugely since the sides met nearly a year ago.

Following that crushing play-off final defeat at Wembley, Derby have topped the Championship at stages this season but sit third after losing to Middlesbrough on Saturday. A League Cup run is a positive, but promotion to the Premier League is the big prize.

Keogh added: ‘It is going to be a good benchmark to see how far we have come since we played them in January. 

'As a squad I think we have really matured. It is going to be a great test but this is why you are in football, to test yourself against the best. We are striving to play against this calibre of team every week.

‘From a year ago they have improved immensely. Mourinho’s addressed the areas he thought were a problem, up front and then (Nemanja) Matic and (Cesc) Fabregas in midfield: so strong mentally and physically. We did a video on the weaknesses on their team and it lasted about five seconds.

‘They are the best team in the Premier League and arguably the best team in Europe.

‘We have to perform at our best to stay in the game and have a chance of achieving our dream result. 

'I want to see how our players perform — have we moved on from a year ago? Because Chelsea have.

‘Mourinho will respect us. That will reflect in the team he picks. We don’t expect any favours.’
