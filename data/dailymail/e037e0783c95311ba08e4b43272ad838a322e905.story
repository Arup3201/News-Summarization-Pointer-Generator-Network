It has long been the bane of travellers’ lives: the bag which is with you when you check in at your departure airport, yet is mysteriously and frustratingly absent when you land at your destination – leaving you gazing forlornly at the luggage carousel as everyone else leaves.

An end to carousel woe? The GPS tags would let passengers check the whereabouts of their bags

But
 help is at hand for every passenger who has ever had to make a frantic 
dash to the shops to buy emergency clothing, or endured a long argument 
with airline staff: the 'intelligent' baggage tag which knows where it – 
and your suitcase – is at all times.

European air giant Air France-KLM is currently working on tags that would use GPS (Global Positioning System) and Bluetooth technology to keep track of a bag’s location.

This means that the whereabouts of a suitcase that has missed its connection could be pinpointed immediately – or that lost luggage could even become a thing of the past.

The tags would also help guard against the problem of bags being delivered correctly, but stolen before passengers caught up in passport-control queues can retrieve them.

Manuel van Lijf of Air France-KLM thinks that the tags could revolutionise air travel – and envisages the devices being rolled out by all airlines in the near future.

‘We have worked closely with our suppliers and with [US airline] Delta to try to make this an industry initiative, not just an airline initiative,’ he told Future Travel Experience.

‘We thought it would be useless to just develop something for us.

‘We wanted to develop something that will benefit the industry and the passengers.

‘The idea was to create a product that can be used by a passenger flying with Air France, KLM, Delta, Lufthansa or another airline,’ he continued.

‘Why would a passenger buy a permanent tag that can only be used on one airline?’

The tags are still in development, but the airline aims to start trials by the end of the year. A small group of passengers could be testing the devices by as soon as December.

Not lost anymore: The tags are still in development, but could be in use by the end of this year

Two types of tag are in development.

The ‘eTag’ is a visible label which would be attached to the outside of the bag, and would communicate using Bluetooth.

The ‘eTrack’ would be placed inside a suitcase, and would operate via GPS as well as Bluetooth – and could be traced by a passenger’s smartphone.

In theory, travellers would be able to check on the status and location of their bags throughout their journey – with, for example, the fact that their luggage has been checked-in registering on their phone within five seconds of the process’s completion.

Air France-KLM is not the only company experimenting with this concept.

Bag manufacturer Samsonite is working on a ‘Track & Trace’ range, which would also allow passengers to keep an electronic eye on their luggage.
