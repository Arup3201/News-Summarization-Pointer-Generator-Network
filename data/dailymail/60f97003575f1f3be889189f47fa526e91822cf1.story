Mario Balotelli showed a high level of maturity against West Ham on Saturday during a clash with goalkeeper Adrian.

The Italian striker, who lost his temper on several occasions during his first spell in the Premier League with Manchester City, managed to keep his cool and refused to be embroiled in a public spat with the Spaniard.

Adrian took exception to a late challenge from Balotelli during the first half of West Ham's eventual 3-1 win against Brendan Rodgers' side at Upton Park.

The 24-year-old was confronted by Adrian, however Balotelli quickly took to his feet while West Ham's custodian shouted and leaned his head towards Liverpool's £16million summer signing.

An incident such as this one may have pushed Balotelli's button during his Manchester City days, however the striker appears to have matured during his time away from England.

Balotelli and Adrian were both booked after the incident - due to the Liverpool star's late tackle and the West Ham shot stopper's inappropriate reaction to the challenge.
