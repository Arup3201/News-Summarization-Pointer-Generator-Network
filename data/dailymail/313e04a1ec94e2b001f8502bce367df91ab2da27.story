A Royal Navy veteran awarded the Arctic Star in recognition of his heroism battling the Nazis 70 years ago died just 90 minutes after receiving the medal.

Herbert Jacobs, 89, was one of thousands of sailors who made what Churchill described 'the worst journey in the world' to the Russian ports of Arkangelsk and Murmansk during the Second World War as part of the Arctic Convoys.

The father-of-two held the new Arctic Star medal in his hand as he lay on his death bed after he received the honour on the day he died.

Mr Jacobs dodged U-boats and icebergs while making several voyages as part of the Arctic Convoys - delivering vital supplies to the Soviet Union.

He was one of many men and women who applied for the new Arctic Star medal to officially recognise their heroism.

The medal, officially awarded for the first time last week, is to honour those who suffered as they made harrowing journeys through icebergs and enemy-infested waters.

But because he was dying from vascular and respiratory problems his son Mike begged officials to give him the honour two weeks before the official medal-giving ceremony.

Mr Jacobs, who joined the forces aged 15 in 1939 and served aboard the HMS Sheffield for two years, received the medal in the post on April 24 - and was to able hold the bronze six-pointed star in his hand as he lay on his death bed.

Father-of-two Mr Jacobs, from Box, Wiltshire, then passed away just ninety minutes after he finally received the honour he had always deserved.

Mike, 64, said: 'I applied on his behalf earlier this year, but heard nothing. I then saw David Cameron on the television announcing it, so I got back in touch.

The Arctic Convoys were oceangoing convoys which sailed from the United Kingdom, Iceland, and North America to northern ports in the Soviet Union.

There were 78 convoys between August 1941 and May 1945 sailing over several seas of the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans.

About 1,400 merchant ships delivered vital supplies to the Soviet Union under the Lend-Lease program, escorted by ships of the Royal Navy, Royal Canadian Navy, and the U.S. Navy.

Eighty-five merchant vessels and 16 Royal Navy warships - two cruisers, six destroyers, eight other escort ships - were lost.

The Nazi German Kriegsmarine lost a number of vessels including one battleship, three destroyers and at least 30 U-boats as well as a large number of aircraft.

'But by the end of April, my dad was fading fast, and I got on to them again and told them his life was coming to an end.

'It came in the post the next day, and it was really special. He got to hold it, he got to see it, he knew what it was, what it was for and what it meant.

'An hour and a half later he passed away.'

During the war Mr Jacobs helped land tanks on the shores of Normandy during D-Day, where a shell missed his head by inches.

He reached the rank of Petty Officer in his spell in the Navy, which ended in 1953 when he moved on to become a stonemason.

The Government's decision to issue medals to Arctic heroes came after decades of campaigning by veterans' groups.

The
sailors are now being awarded the medal for playing a vital role in 
keeping Soviet Russia supplied in their desperate fight against the 
Nazis.

Mike, a 
professional driver, added: 'He was one of many brave young men that 
went to war. I'm so proud of him, of course. I'm going to cherish the 
medal forever.'

Mr Jacobs, who had several grandchildren, was married to Barbara, who died in 2009.
