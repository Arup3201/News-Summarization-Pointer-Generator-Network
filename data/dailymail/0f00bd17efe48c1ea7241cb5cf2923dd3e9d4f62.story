Freddie Starr was last night forced to admit being ‘mistaken’ after footage from 1974 showed him alongside the teenage girl who now claims he abused her.

Starr had strenuously denied ever meeting Karin Ward – who claims he tried to molest her in Sir Jimmy Savile’s BBC dressing room.

The comic had also insisted he only met Savile twice in his life, and had never even been to the BBC.

But last night he was proved wrong on all three counts after watching 1974 footage unearthed by Channel 4 News.

It showed Starr appearing on one of 
Savile’s BBC shows, Clunk Click – the very episode Miss Ward says was 
being filmed the day she was abused.

Standing next to him was a 14-year-old Miss Ward, in a yellow blouse and long brown hair.

Last night Starr’s lawyers issued a 
statement admitting the mistake, but still strenuously denying the 
‘awful allegation’ of abuse.

The 69-year-old comedian was first 
named by Miss Ward when she spoke to the BBC’s Newsnight reporters last 
year for a report which was never broadcast.

Then last week she told ITV News: ‘I 
was horribly, horribly humiliated by Freddie Starr, who had a very bad 
attack of wandering hands and had groped me, and I didn’t like him 
because he smelled like my step-father and it frightened me and freaked 
me out, and I rebuffed him.’

It prompted Starr to seek an injunction to prevent the claims being aired, but his High Court application was rejected.

On Friday, he invited reporters into 
his home in Warwickshire, and told them the woman was ‘a nutter’ and 
accused her of ‘picking my name out of a hat’. He said: ‘I’ve never 
touched an under-age girl in my life.

‘I have never been in any situation with Jimmy Savile and Gary Glitter, and I have certainly never been with this woman.

‘She’s claiming I made advances to her, it didn’t happen. I’ve only met Jimmy Savile maybe twice.’

He also said: ‘Don’t tar me with the same brush as a scumbag and a paedophile.’

Starr, whose fiancee Sophie Lea, 34, 
became pregnant with his fifth child last November, made further claims 
on Friday night when he went on stage in Wolverhampton on the first 
night of a stand-up comedy tour.

Branding Miss Ward a ‘liar’, he told his audience: ‘My brief is going to tear her to pieces. I’ve never been to the BBC.’  

However, he changed his mind yesterday
 after the footage obtained by Channel 4 News showed him appearing as a 
‘special guest’ of Savile during the BBC programme.

Last night a spokesman for Starr said:
 ‘Freddie is now 69 and cannot be expected to recollect every show that 
he has appeared on and to remember every person that he has met.

'It would
 now appear from seeing footage of a Clunk Click show aired in 1974 that
 in fact Freddie was mistaken and therefore that he had in fact been on a
 Jimmy Savile show.

‘However this does not detract away 
from the fact that Freddie vigorously denies the awful allegation that 
has been made by Karin Ward, which despite this footage is still totally
 unsupported and uncorroborated by any other evidence.’

Miss Ward – who also claimed to have 
seen paedophile pop star Gary Glitter raping a 13-year-old girl in 
Savile’s dressing room on a different occasion – was a pupil at the 
now-defunct Duncroft School for girls.

Savile used to prey on under-age girls at the school and invited his favourites to London to watch his shows being recorded.

Yesterday, Biddy Baxter, the former editor of Blue Peter told Radio 5 Live how she was a victim of sexual harassment at the BBC.

Miss Baxter, 79, who held the position
 between 1965 and 1988, said she endured ‘several slightly hairy 
encounters’ with overly-friendly male producers during her early career.

She added: ‘There’s been such a change
 of culture since then. Now, that sort of incident is taken notice of 
whether that’s a good thing or not.’

A campaign was launched yesterday to 
posthumously strip Sir Jimmy Savile of his knighthood. Victims of child 
abuse are to lobby MPs for the honour to be removed.

■ Vanessa Feltz has claimed she was groped by a ‘married, avuncular, much-beloved national treasure’ while hosting a TV chat show in the mid-1990s.

The presenter, who at the time was working on ITV chat show Vanessa, and Channel 4’s The Big Breakfast, said that her guest put his hand up her skirt during a live interview, which left her feeling ‘humiliation and outrage’ even now.
