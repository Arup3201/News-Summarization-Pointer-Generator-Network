Paedophile: Michael Brignull has been jailed for 11 years but the mother of one of his victims refused to believe that her child was abused

A mother has spoken of her shame after she refused to believe her daughter was abused until police showed her a photograph of her being attacked by a paedophile now in jail for his sex crimes.

Michael Brignull, 60, was a described as a 'surrogate grandfather' to the young woman but it later emerged he abused her throughout her childhood.

He is is starting an 11-year prison sentence after he was convicted of possessing child pornography and a string of attacks including two attempted rapes.

The girl's mother, 43, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said his crimes 'ripped her family apart' because they had known Brignull for 27 years.

'We were so close Mick used to come to our house for Christmas dinner and my children used to stay with him for school holidays,' she said.

'He was a surrogate grandfather to them.'

The victim, now aged 17, was at her brother's 18th birthday party, when she told a family friend she was being abused by Brignull, of Thorney Bay Caravan Park, Canvey, Essex.

Her mother said: 'My first reaction was "oh my God, she is a bloody liar". I thought she was jealous her brother was getting all the attention because it was his 18th. I 110 per cent did not believe her.'

The next day the mother confronted her then 16-year-old daughter.

She said: 'I said to her "put your coat on, we are going to the police station". She was hysterical and refused to go. Then a few days later she wrote me a letter explaining what Mick had done to her.

'She said she didn't want to talk about it, so I wrote her a letter back. We carried on like that. Writing letters back and forwards to eachother.

'Then I took the letters to the police.'

In March 2012, Essex Police officers went to the family's home.

The woman said: 'They produced a cropped picture they had found on Mick's laptop. It was a picture of my daughter being abused.

'I was devastated I had not believed her and this could go on without me ever suspecting. I kept saying over and over, 'this cannot be true'.

It is believed the victim was abused for much of her childhood.

The victim's mother added: 'I found out later my daughter didn't want to tell me what was happening because she didn't want to upset me.

'This has ripped our family apart and to my shame I didn't believe my little girl.'

The victim has since moved away from Essex with her family.

Police described Brignull as a 'dangerous man who wormed his way in to a family'.

Investigating officer, Det Con Mark Matthews, from Essex Police, said Brignull was someone who 'threatened the safety of others'.

Det Con Matthews, said: 'He is a dangerous man who wormed his way into this family and then abused his position

of trust over a prolonged period of time.'
