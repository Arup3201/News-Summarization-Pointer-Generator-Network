A mansion which was hailed as Scotland's most expensive new home and advertised for £8million has been sold for less than £1million.

Prospective buyers were told The Whitehouse at Gleneagles in Perthshire was a bargain despite the massive asking price when it was put on the market three years ago.

The luxury home in an exclusive gated communities within the grounds of the Gleneagles Hotel and Golf Resort was described as a 'Great Gatsby-style' mansion with a blend of Georgian and Art Deco styles.

When building of the luxury home stalled after a buyer could not be found, the house sold for a knockdown price of just £861,888

The 13,000sq ft mansion was planned to come complete with its own swimming pool, orangery, soundproofed cinema, three-car garage and more than half an acre of garden.

It was marketed to rich foreign golf fans but failed to attract a buyer and development work on it stalled before it was repossessed by a bank in 2013.

Property records show it has now been sold to a local businessman for a knockdown price of £861,888. 

Part of the package includes free membership of the Gleneagles resort for two years, including golf and use of the luxury facilities.

The mansion is in the grounds of the world famous Gleneagles Hotel and Resort which boasts three championship golf courses

The house was expected to be ready for occupation ahead of the 2014 staging of the Ryder Cup match between Europe and the USA at Gleneagles.

But as it was never completed last year estate agents Savills slashed the price to offers over £750,000 - one of the biggest price reductions in Scottish property history.

When it was first advertised John Coleman, a partner with selling agents Smiths Gore, said despite the property's daunting price tag there should be no problem in attracting potential buyers across the globe.

He said at the time: 'Not only is it architecturally stunning with state-of-the-art finishes and is a golf lover's dream, but at £500 per square foot it is a relative bargain, compared to other luxury properties worldwide which go for ten times that.

'In Hong Kong, the average price of luxury property is almost £7,000 per sq ft and in Mayfair in London sales are achieving £5,500 per sq ft.

'We are looking at people who want to buy something special at a golf hotel resort. 

'Everything will be top spec. This is about buying the very best of what Scotland has to offer on the very best golf resort. We think, in world terms, this is good value for money.'

The Whitehouse was the most expensive of the 14 homes planned to be built on Queen's Crescent - an exclusive gated community within the Gleneagles resort. 

Each of the plots was sold off for around £1m by the hotel owners.

The house was meant to be ready for occupation ahead of the 2014 Ryder Cup match between Europe and the USA at Gleneagles

The world-famous hotel in Scotland has three championship courses, the King's Course, the Queen's Course and the Centenary Course as well as the nine hole 'Wee Course'.

When it was opened in 1924, Gleneagles was described as 'a Riviera in the Highlands' and 'the eighth wonder of the world'.

It most recently hosted the 2014 Ryder Cup which saw Team Europe beat Team USA 16½ to 11½ to complete a hat-trick of successive wins in the tournament. 

The hotel was built by the former Caledonian Railway Company, with its own railway station just minutes away, and is now owned by Diageo plc.

In 1919 The King's and Queen's courses opened on the same day, but  The King's but was only nine holes until it was completed as a full 18 in 1925. 

When the Second World War broke out in 1939 the hotel closed and became a military hospital and then a miners' rehabilitation centre. It reopened as a hotel in May 1947.

In 1993 the PGA Centenary Course, created by Jack Nicklaus, opened to complement the renowned King's and Queen's courses and form one of the world's finest golfing venues.
