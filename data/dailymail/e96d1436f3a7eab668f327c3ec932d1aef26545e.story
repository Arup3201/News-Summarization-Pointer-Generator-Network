Kate Fisher is so besotted with her dog Rupert that she has taken a photograph of him every day for a year.

In addition Miss Fisher, 54, has blogged about how Rupert, three, changed from a shy and fearful rescue puppy to a friendly and confident canine.

The dog blog started in March last year three months after Rupert arrived at Miss Fisher's home in Bookham, Surrey, from a violent and uncertain life in Romania.

When Rupert arrived from Romania, he was shy and fearful. Now he is a loving dog who enjoys his life

The German wirehaired pointer cross has since become a hit with 20,000 views on the online photo sharing journal Blipfoto from as far wide as Australia and New Zealand.

Mother-of-one Miss Fisher said: ‘The project didn't start as a way of showing Rupert's journey but the way he has flourished whilst being here in Surrey has just been phenomenal.

‘When Rupert first came over he was scared of cars and had not seen horses or sheep and was always wondering if they were going to hurt him.

‘That was the best thing about photographing him every day for a year - seeing the change and progression of him.

‘It is his personal story captured on camera.’

Rupert the dog came to England in a van with around 30 other dogs from Romania, saved by a charity based in the country.

Amateur photographer Miss Fisher said: ‘He came to us as a very nervous and naive dog and the journal tells the story of his growing trust in the human race after a very bad start and his joy at finding a home surrounded by beautiful countryside that he can explore.

‘I was actually looking through a magazine and there was an article about new websites, one of which was Blipfoto, which is a social media site where you upload a picture a day, so I gave it a go.

‘I basically signed up to it because I wanted to better my photography skills but am quite a private person so did not want my own life out on display.

‘It has certainly helped me understand the camera more by using different modes and I am able to capture different types of picture now too.’

Miss Fisher has not carried on with Rupert's daily journal since it finished but has been inundated with requests to continue it.

She added: ‘I wanted to take a rest from uploading pictures but I get people from America, New Zealand, France and wherever else asking for updates on Rupert, so I am going to put one up every now and again.’
