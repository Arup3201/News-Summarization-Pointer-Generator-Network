A workman suffered horrific burns to his arm after he was electrocuted with a million watts of power when he broke through a power cable with a jackhammer.

Tom Sharp, 52, wasn't told that high voltage cables ran underneath a car park he was working on and he suffered serious burns from the shock, equivalent to 250,000 electric fires.

The burns he suffered were so severe that his clothes seared to his skin causing 20 per cent burns to his arms, face and neck.

He spent more than a month in hospital receiving treatment for his wounds.

The company who owned the car park, Northgate Vehicle Sales, in Darlington, County Durham, failed to apply for plans showing the location of the electrical services, Darlington Magistrates Court heard.

The firm had employed Mr Sharp as a sub-contractor to erect a metal fence and he was digging holes using the groundbreaker when he hit a cable.

The resulting shock was powerful enough to vaporise the circuit breaker's tip.

Northgate Vehicle Services pleaded guilty to breaching health and safety regulations by failing to inform the main contractor of the underground cables.

After admitting liability following a Health and Safety Executive (HSE) investigation, the company was fined £12,000 and ordered to pay £6,123 costs.

Mr Sharp, from Crook, County Durham, spent more than a month in hospital after the incident in November 2010 and had physiotherapy and treatment for his burns for more than a year.

He is still receiving therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the incident.

Speaking after the hearing, Mr Sharp said: 'My physical injuries have improved in the last two years, but they are still not 100 per cent.

'I have problems with strength and movement in my arms and I've had to step back from some of the physical work involved in running my company.

'I'm still having psychological treatment. I go to therapy sessions to go to help me with post-traumatic stress.

'I was actually digging the last hole when it happened. I remember a massive, massive flash and just getting burned. I was thrown back by the electric shock.'

HSE investigator Jonathan Wills told magistrates that Northgate Vehicle Sales was under a legal obligation to provide contractors with all reasonable safety information, including details of high voltage electricity cables.

Mr Wills said: 'Northgate should have been able to do this simply by calling the utility company, which would have provided detailed plans. When asked why they had not requested such plans they said they had not

envisaged that there would be any cables in the area.

'This is an unusual comment, given that the company is based in a heavily industrialised area.'

Defending the company Alison Gray said: 'Northgate Vehicle Sales entirely accepts that it was up to them to get the plans showing the cables and they did not do so.

'Staff did not believe there were cables in the area because the company has no need for high-voltage power and there is no sub-station nearby.

'They did provide information about cables for CCTV and lighting which shows they did provide information on some cables, but not others.'

In a statement, David Henderson, Northgate Plc company secretary, said: 'The company has always placed a high priority on the health and safety of its staff, its contractors and other members of the public.

'The company has reviewed and amended its systems and procedures since this incident so as to prevent a reoccurrence.'
