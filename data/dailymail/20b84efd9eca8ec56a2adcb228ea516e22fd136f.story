The hectic pace of modern life has led to time-saving showers becoming more popular than baths, a study has shown.

While three-quarters of people still have a bath and a shower in their home, it is the shower that sees the most use – with Britons taking an average of 227 showers a year. 

And a third of us take just four baths or fewer over the course of an entire year.

Research by the hotel booking site, LateRooms.com also showed those living in the southwest take the fewest showers – 208 per year on average. 

Meanwhile people living in Wales take the most showers every year – 251 on average.

But baths prove more popular when people visit hotels with businessmen and couples much more likely to soak in a bath than take a shower.

Andrea Tarpey, of LateRooms.com said: ‘We polled more than 2,000 UK adults in order to shed some light on the nation’s bathing habits.

‘The bathroom is a hugely important part of a hotel stay and often why guests will even choose a room, so we wanted to examine the nation’s perceptions about the whole bathing experience.

‘Our research shows that almost a quarter of the UK (24 percent) admits that even when plunged into a relaxing bubble bath they can’t resist using their smartphone to check up on social media and texts.

'According to these new statistics, the average time Brits spend soaking in a tub of hot water is 20 minutes.

‘What is abundantly clear is that while our busy lives means we don’t have as much time to enjoy a hot soak in a lovely bath as we’d like, we still prefer baths to showers.

‘And that means when we take a relaxing trip away from home we’re much more likely to indulge ourselves and have a bath rather than a shower.’
