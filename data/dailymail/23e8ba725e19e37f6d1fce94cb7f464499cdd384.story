Surrounded by trees, waterfalls and tropical wildlife, this Amazon tribe is a world away from the beaches of Rio.

These striking photos show members of the indigenous Dessana tribe, which is situated nearly 3,000 miles away from Brazil's capital.

It is only accessible by boat from the city of Manaus - where England will play their first World Cup game in June this year. 

Captivating: A young member of the indigenous Dessana tribe gazes at the camera with piercing green eyes, while sporting streaks of green and black paint on his face

Making music: Three children play pan pipes in their leafy home in the Amazon rainforest, which is situated nearly 3,000 miles away from Brazil's capital, Rio de Janeiro

Photographer David Lazar, 30, captured a series of portraits of tribe members, including a young boy with piercing green eyes and a 
Dessana chief in full head dress.

He also photographed children playing pan pipes, colourful Macaw birds sat on a tree branch and a mother and grandmother kissing a small child.

Mr Lazar, from Brisbane, took most of the photos in two Dessana villages in the rainforest, but also travelled thousands of miles south to the Iguazu Falls on the Argentine border.

'I travelled by boat to reach the Dessana tribe who live on the bank of the river and still honour their traditional roots and customs,' he said.

Smiling: He took most of the photos - including this one of a chief - in two Dessana villages in the rainforest, but also travelled thousands of miles south to the Iguazu Falls

Tribeswomen: 'I travelled by boat to reach the tribe who still honour their traditional roots and customs,' said Mr Lazar. Above, two tribeswomen pose for photographs

'They were such a peaceful and 
friendly people. The chief wears traditional face paint, a full feather 
head dress, and his smile shows the warmth and happiness of the peaceful
 tribe.

'You can see from 
the picture of the mum, grandmother and baby together how family and 
community play an important role in the raising of an Amazonian child.

'The children in the forest also happily play together. The feathers in the 
boys' headdresses are made from a Macaw bird, and these are worn to mark
 the identities of tribal groups.'

He said he hoped the images would show an alternative view of Brazil, which is also due to host the Olympic Games in 2016.

Joyful: Mr Lazar said he hoped the images - including this one of three Dessana children - would show an alternative view of Brazil, which will host the Olympics in 2016

Elaborate tribal wear: 'The feathers in the boys' headdresses are made from a Macaw bird, and these are worn to mark the identities of tribal groups,' he said

'It is such an amazing and vast country,'
 he said. 'The cities and beaches are all great but there is another 
Brazil that need to be seen.

"Thousands of miles from the Dessana is another amazing sight, the Iguazu Falls. The legend tells of a story about a God who had planned to marry himself to a beautiful woman named Naipí.

'When he found her fleeing with her mortal lover Tarobá in a canoe, the God split the river in two out of fury, condemning them eternally inside the gushing waters of the falls.'

Mr Lazar, who has also travelled to Bangladesh, Kenya and south east Asia to photograph locals, said he enjoyed capturing scenes that 'defy time'.

'I am drawn to subjects that do not reflect the modern world - I like to capture scenes that could have been taken 100 years ago,' he said.

'I find this type of subject interesting as it is very different from my usual life in Australia and I enjoy capturing and sharing these scenes of the world that most people don't get to see.

'I especially love portrait photos, and capturing expressive, unique and powerful faces that evoke a sense of emotion in the viewer.'

Mr Lazar said that he managed to interact and photograph tribes by 'smiling', 'engaging with tribe members' and 'using phrases in other languages'.
