Many commuters may be fed up with over-crowding on the railways, but there are some stations which serve a just handful of passengers each year.

New figures have revealed a number of 'ghost' stations which receive fewer than 100 travellers a year - with the least-used facility serving just 14 last year.

These practically redundant stations are apparently kept open by the rail companies solely so they can avoid the bureaucracy it would take to officially close them.

Deserted: Teesside Airport railway station is Britain's least-used with just 14 passengers last year

Overkill: Dorking West, which served 16 passengers, is one of three stations in the town of 17,000

Data released yesterday by the Office of Rail Regulation rank every station in the country by how many passengers pass through each year.

The least-used station of all was Teesside Airport, near Darlington, which was visited by just 14 passengers in the 2011-12 financial year.

The station's unpopularity is due to the fact that it receives just one train per week, and is linked to an airport with just two regular scheduled flights.

Second is Dorking West in Surrey, where 16 passengers got on or off a train last year.

Although trains stop at the station every two hours, it is crippled by being one of three stations in a town of just 17,000 inhabitants.

Campaign: Activists argue that Denton in Greater Manchester, where 30 passengers got on or off a train last year, deserves a more frequent service

Underused: Reddish South is on the same line as Denton, receiving just one train a week with no return service, and welcomed 56 passengers last year

1. Teesside Airport, Co Durham - 14 passengers

2. Dorking West, Surrey - 16 passengers

3. Denton, Greater Manchester - 30 passengers

4. Reddish South, Greater Manchester - 56 passengers

5. Coombe, Cornwall - 60 passengers

6. Elton & Orston, Nottinghamshire - 72 passengers

7. Barry Links, Angus - 86 passengers

8. Breich, West Lothian - 90 passengers

9. Buckenham, Norfolk - 100 passengers

10. Sugar Loaf, Powys - 120 passengers

Denton, in Greater Manchester, is at the centre of a campaign aiming to increase its number of passengers from the 30 it received in 2011-12.

Activists argue that the only reason the station cannot attract more people is that it receives just one train a week, heading to Stalybridge, while there is no service which goes in the opposite direction.

Alan Jones, chairman of the Friends of Denton Station, suggested that the figures were misleading and blamed railway officials for the station's neglect.

'I'm sure that if there were more trains people would use them,' he told the Independent. 'This is a valued service and we are trying to get a regular service.'

But Northern Rail said the only reason it kept the station open was to fulfil the terms of its franchise agreement.

A total of eight stations had passenger numbers in double figures, including Reddish South, Coombe and Barry Links.

By way of comparison, the busiest station in 2011-12 was London Waterloo, where 94,045,510 passed through.

All of the top seven busiest were in London, with Victoria and Liverpool Street taking second and third place.

The highest-placed stations outside the capital were Birmingham New Street, Glasgow Central and Leeds.

Scandal: Stations like Coombe, which served 60 people last year, are kept open for bureaucratic reasons

Contrast: The busiest station in Britain last year was London Waterloo, with nearly 100million passengers

The neglect of so many of Britain's smaller stations underlines how many areas are under-served by the railway network despite having their own facilities for trains.

It is easier for train operating countries to run 'zombie' services on lines they no longer wish to serve properly, as closing stations requires a lengthy consultation process.

The 50th anniversary of the Beeching cuts which closed more than 2,000 stations fell earlier this year.

The controversial move meant many smaller towns were left with a station, and many services were re-routed to pass through London and other population hubs.

But the latest figures on unused stations show that even some communities which were spared the axe do not have an effectively functioning railway.
