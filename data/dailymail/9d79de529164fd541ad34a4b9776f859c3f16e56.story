All professional players in English football will be banned from betting on any matches anywhere in the world from next season.

The ruling, which was first revealed by Sportsmail's Charles Sale in February, was ratified at the Football Association's AGM on Wednesday and will apply to any player in the top eight tiers of the English league system, Press Association Sport understands.

It replaces the current rules which only banned players from betting on competitions in which their club was involved.

Ban: Pro footballers playing in England will not be allowed to bet on any matches anywhere in the world

Tottenham winger Andros Townsend, Newcastle's Dan Gosling - who is to join Bournemouth next season - and Cameron Jerome, who played on loan at Crystal Palace from Stoke last season, are among those to have been found to have breached current betting regulations.

Players will also be prohibited from passing on inside information to a third party who uses that information for betting.

The FA confirmed the ban would start from August 1 and also cover betting on new managers or player transfers.

It said in a statement: 'A worldwide ban on betting on football will come into force from 1 August 2014 for certain participants in English football.

'Participants covered by the ban will be prohibited from betting, either directly or indirectly, on any football match or competition that takes place anywhere in the world.

'The changes to FA rules from the start of the 2014/15 season will also effect a worldwide prohibition on betting on any other football-related matter.

'For example, the transfer of players, employment of managers or team selection. The passing of inside information to somebody that uses the information for betting remains prohibited.'
