Toast of the town: Rachel Weisz is in the running for an Oscar

Rachel Weisz cracked open a bottle of ‘quite good red wine’ with her old man Daniel Craig to help celebrate — and get over the shock of — suddenly being hurled into the Oscar race.

The actress, who already has a best supporting Academy Award for The Constant Gardener,  was named best actress by the influential New York Film Critics Circle for her role in The Deep  Blue Sea, based on a Fifties Terence Rattigan play about a woman completely overtaken by passion.

She prevailed over perceived front-runners Jennifer Lawrence for The  Silver Linings Playbook, Jessica Chastain, star of Zero Dark Thirty, and Marion Cotillard for Rust And Bone.

‘Listen, I’m more shocked, more surprised than anyone. It came out of nowhere,’ Rachel told me from New York,  noting that The Deep Blue Sea opened in America last March in just a handful of cinemas.

She and Craig, aka 007, enjoyed sipping the premier vino. ‘It’s  all wintry here, so it’s perfect for red wine.’

In the film, Rachel stars as  Hester Collyer opposite Simon Russell Beale as Sir William  Collyer, the High Court judge husband she abandons for Freddie Page, her lusty RAF pilot lover played by Tom Hiddleston.

Rachel gives an electrifying performance as  Hester. ‘She’s someone who falls crazily, madly, deeply in love. She humiliates herself and she’s someone who’s ruled by her heart, soul and her groin,’ Rachel observed.

‘People are going to scorn her and she knows she’s not doing the right thing. I wouldn’t much like that to happen to me, but in drama it’s a very interesting thing to explore.’

She rather admires Hester, a woman ‘who wants to make her life in the way that she chooses to, and I think that’s very brave  and modern’.

It’s too early to tell whether the prize in New York will lead to further pre-Oscar trophies. But ‘in practical terms’, the actress said that the win brings about an awareness for a tiny  independent film.

It has certainly made Oscar voters pay attention to a portrait of a woman  prepared to lose everything for love.

Perhaps Rachel and Daniel should order in a few more choice bottles of red wine just in case.

The Bond movie Skyfall has turned into a cash windfall for director Sam Mendes and the film’s leading actors.

Because it has taken so much money globally (more than £543 million in ticket sales so far), Mendes and certain cast members — including James Bond himself, Daniel Craig, baddie Javier Bardem and spy chiefs Judi Dench and Ralph Fiennes — are entitled to box-office bonuses said to be in the six-figure range.

The director and each of  the actors could end up with $100,000 (£62,000) to $200,000 (£125,000) apiece. There are also awards bonuses, so if any of the actors are nominated for an Oscar, Bafta or Golden Globe, they are rewarded — and they  get more if, perchance, they should win.

Box office bonuses kick in after Skyfall reaches a certain figure, say, $200 million and the bonus  accumulates the more Skyfall makes. And as it’s heading towards the billion dollar mark, the bounty will end up being a very tidy sum.

Mendes and the actors would have negotiated different deals with producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, so each amount will be different.

‘It’s going to be in the six-figure range for most of them and at the moment the sky’s the limit because it hasn’t stopped taking money,’ an executive in London with knowledge of the arrangement told me.

Actors and film-makers sometimes receive a percentage of a film’s revenue. But Broccoli and Wilson never give away slices of their Bond films, only bonuses for a lucky few. Broccoli and Wilson have been fantastic at guiding Bond away from dreariness and they hit the jackpot with Skyfall.

Pre-production begins on the next 007 
films, provisionally known as Bond 24 and Bond 25, in the spring. There 
has been talk of them shooting back-to-back later next year.

Mendes is still mulling over whether he will direct them. There’s no official word, but there’s a sense that he might not do them.

For starters, he’s directing  the new musical Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, which starts previewing at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane on May 18 with  Douglas Hodge and Nigel Planer in leading roles.

If he directs the Bond double, that would mean he’d have to devote three or four years  to being on 007 duty. He may not fancy that.

A lot of changes were being put into the Spice Girls musical Viva Forever last night. I’ve been hearing mixed views during previews, but I know producer Judy Craymer and her creative team will turn the show at the Piccadilly Theatre into a hit.

Once upon a time actor Hugh Sachs worked in the National Theatre’s box office. Now he’ll play lawyer Harry Dangle, one of the key parts in the National’s hit comedy One Man, Two Guvnors, when a new cast takes over — led by Rufus Hound — on February 4 at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket. Sachs also appeared in Privates On Parade when Michael Grandage directed it at the Donmar. Grandage has a splendid new production of that show opening on Monday night at the Noel Coward.
