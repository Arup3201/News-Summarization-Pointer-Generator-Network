Drug possession is being decriminalised ‘by the back door’, it has been claimed – with fewer than 1 per cent of those caught with narcotics going to prison.

Of the 148,000 people found with drugs last year, including heroin and cocaine, only 1,141 were sent to jail.

The figures were even lower for those caught with Class B drugs - with only 541 in England and Wales imprisoned. Some 64,000 cannabis users received nothing more than a ticking off.

Critics said the figures showed drug possession was being decriminalised by stealth – despite the Prime Minister’s insistence that drug use was ‘never acceptable’.

The revelations come in the wake of a Home Office report which demanded a radical shake-up of the UK’s drug laws.

The Lib Dems claimed the study, which compared drugs policies in different countries around the world, showed that relaxing the rules on banned narcotics did not increase the number of addicts.

Hailing the report as a ‘dramatic blow’ to hardliners, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg strengthened his support for decriminalisation of drugs for personal use – including deadly Class A substances.

Lib Dem Home Office minister Norman Baker blasted strict punishments for possession in the UK and criticised the authorities for ‘banging up’ those caught with small amounts of drugs.

But an analysis of police arrests for possessing drugs revealed only a tiny proportion – just 0.8 per cent – received a custodial sentence, even though there is the threat of a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for possessing Class A substances.

In 2013-14, police issued penalties for drug possession to around 148,189 people, according to Home Office and Ministry of Justice figures.

Some 63,967 were let off with a cannabis warning – where a culprit is given a stern talking to by a police officer in the street. 

A further 14,768 received penalty notices – on-the-spot fines – ordering them to pay a minimum £60. And another 31,368 were given a caution – effectively a slap on the wrist.

Of those hauled before a court 38,120 were sentenced, of which 1,141 were sent to prison.

David Green, chief executive of think-tank Civitas, said: ‘When people like the Liberal Democrats say that our regime is too severe and needs relaxing, they are wrong. 

'We have been trying a drugs policy of ultra-relaxation. I find it very puzzling. We have already got as close to decriminalising possession of drugs as is possible without actually taking the final step.

‘I don’t want to see people in prison for possessing a small bit of cannabis. They need educating and treating. But the Liberal Democrats are going even further with their calls for decriminalisation.

‘The point of the law is to protect the weak, the vulnerable and the easily addicted and decriminalisation would see them exploited by drug dealers.’

Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention think-tank, said: ‘It is completely false to pretend that we have so far been fighting a tough war on drugs.

‘This decriminalisation by the back door means people see very little risk associated with trying drugs – and then potentially becoming hooked.’

Shadow crime minister Diana Johnson said: ‘Nick Clegg’s proposal is nonsense.’

A Home Office source said: ‘Banning prison sentences for these individuals will make it harder to get them into treatment programmes and lead to higher crime rates.'
