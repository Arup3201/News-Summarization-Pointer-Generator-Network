Stuart Lancaster’s quest to make light of England’s injury crisis received support from an unlikely source at Wednesday’s RBS 6 Nations launch.

Lancaster was forced to repeatedly clarify the latest medical bulletins and confirm that four more leading men — Tom Wood, Brad Barritt, Geoff Parling and Kyle Eastmond — have been ruled out of the championship opener against Wales in Cardiff a week on Friday.

In fact, it remains unclear whether any of that wounded quartet will be fit for the home encounter with Italy eight days later, while the prospects of Wood and Eastmond being ruled out of the entire tournament cannot be discounted. England are already without Owen Farrell, Manu Tuilagi, Ben Morgan, Courtney Lawes and Joe Launchbury, but there is no doom and gloom.

Mark Cueto, scorer of the try that never was in England’s 2007 World Cup final defeat by South Africa in Paris, will retire at the end of this season. The Sale wing, 35, who toured with the Lions in 2005, is the Aviva Premiership’s most prolific try-scorer with 87. He said: ‘In my head, I could carry on playing forever, but the body is not doing what the mind tells it to.’

Cueto, who scored 20 tries in 55 games for England, crossed in the 2007 final only for TV referee Stuart Dickinson to say his foot had touched a line.

Lancaster’s enduring optimism was endorsed by none other than his Wales counterpart, Warren Gatland, who isn’t convinced by talk of a crisis. Such is the depth of Test-class English talent that he believes they will pose a formidable threat at the Millennium Stadium, whoever they select.

‘England have a huge amount of depth in a lot of positions,’ he said. ‘It doesn’t matter what team England put out, they are going to be strong. We saw that last summer where they were able to put out a different team against the All Blacks and did exceptionally well.

‘The challenge for us is to make sure we don’t allow the (England) injuries to become a distraction and people talk us up too much. England have a few injuries but they have options and can play different types of games.’

Lancaster and his assistants have been assailed by bad news at an especially bad time, as they prepare for their last championship campaign before this year’s home World Cup. Being deprived of so many front-line players is far from ideal, but the head coach delivered a typically upbeat assessment — albeit ‘through gritted teeth’ — after a weekend of setbacks.

‘It was a tough weekend watching the games and you sit there with your fingers crossed,’ he said. ‘Unfortunately three or four big players got varying degrees of injury which is hugely disappointing. I had a look at the pack and there’s still a lot of strength in depth, more so than in the backs, where some decisions need to be made.’

Lancaster has a point about the pack — there are countless prime contenders. Wood is awaiting specialist advice regarding his ankle injury but the head coach said ‘we can safely assume he’ll struggle to be available for Wales’.

Yet, there is a ready-made replacement blindside flanker in the imposing shape of James Haskell — arguably in the form of his life as Wasps captain and someone who the management would have been tempted to select in the starting XV anyway.

The second-row void is more problematic as the coaches are without three key men: Parling, Lawes and Launchbury. Dave Attwood is a shoo-in starter, with George Kruis of Saracens likely to partner him, straight after finishing a ban for a dangerous tackle. He made a strong impression during the autumn, but the Millennium Stadium will provide a fervent test of his credentials.

Further forward, Leicester prop Dan Cole is on course to be fit for next week and it is understood he will be thrust straight back into action as a bench reserve, ahead of Kieran Brookes.

The loss of Eastmond is a blow, but in truth he was unlikely to start at inside centre while his Bath colleague, George Ford, is wearing No 10. Barritt’s absence will be keenly felt and Lancaster is now likely to reunite Billy Twelvetrees and Luther Burrell in midfield, despite their patchy form and the compelling case being made by Jonathan Joseph for a recall in the wider channel.

Gatland identified England’s heroic display with a weakened team against the All Blacks in Auckland last June as a reason to be wary of whatever line-up they muster on February 6. Lancaster added: ‘Injuries are not something we focus on within our camp. We are confident we are still going to have a pretty good team.’

Kiwi Gatland is fond of underdog status, but Wales will surely relinquish that to England next week. They will be at home and more or less at full strength, unlike their decimated rivals.

But Gatland is right to exercise caution. The visitors will be a force to be reckoned with, whoever is wearing white on the night.
