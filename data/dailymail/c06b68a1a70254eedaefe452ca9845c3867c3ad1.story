Eddie McGuire has weighed into the debate about Swans star Adam Goodes 'staging' 

Following cricketer Shane Warne's accusations that Sydney Swans star Adam Goodes 'staged' for a free kick during  Saturday night's AFL game, a few more people have weighed into the discussion.

Warne also revealed he didn't know Goodes had been awarded Australian of the Year back in January and wrote 'who votes for that?'. Goodes pointed out Warne's former teammate Adam Gilchrist is head of the Australia Day Council.

Collingwood president and Millionaire Hot Seat host Eddie McGuire, who is thought not to be on good terms with Goodes after a spat earlier this year, took Warne's side of the debate.

He told Channel Nine's The Today Show on Monday morning: ''Adam Goodes has been staging for free kicks a bit this year and Warnie's weighed in with his two bobs worth.'

'It's become a part of his game that he just needs to eradicate. He's too good a player, he's the star of the game but he's been doing the Fosbury Flop far too often and he's been called on it,' McGuire said.

Speaking about Warne having no idea Goodes was Australian of the year, Maguire also made the suggestion that the Swans star  may not have realised when he brought Adam Gilchrist into the conversation, he and Warne were not on speaking terms.

'Maybe Goodesey didn't realise that they don't speak to each other', McGuire laughed. 

Former Essendon footballer Matthew Lloyd held the same view and told the Nine Network he too believes Goodes, a dual Brownlow medallist, staged during the match against Richmond.

'He's better than that,' Lloyd said.

'It's something in the game currently that people are more and more aware of, and absolutely hate.

'I think it's something (Swans coach) John Longmire should say to him: "pull up, just focus on the footy because you don't need to do that".'

'Staging' or faking a fall in order to gain a free kick has been a contentious issue within the AFL over the past few year. It is equated to 'diving' in soccer. 

Speaking on Sunday, Goodes admitted he was disappointed at the commentary and scrutiny, but unswayed.

During an AFL game on Saturday Former Australian cricketer Shane Warne made a bizarre admission on Twitter that he didn't know Swans star Adam Goodes was Australian of the Year

'Until you've been out on the footy field and you cop what happens out there, it's hard for them to make judgement,' he said.

'It's disappointing from the players who are ex-players, because they've been out there. They know what it's like.

'Is it going to affect me or the way I play my footy ... definitely not. That's their criticism ... it doesn't bother me', Goodes revealed.

It all began during a social media exchange at the weekend, when former Australian cricketer Shane Warne was talking sport with good mate and fellow cricketer Michael Clarke.

During the AFL match between the Sydney Swans and Richmond Tigers on Saturday evening Warne accused Swans star Adam Goodes of staging, or taking theatrical dives in order to earn free kicks during the game. 

Goodes hit back on Sunday morning mentioning Warne's former teammate and fellow cricketer Adam Gilchrist

'Come on tigers beat those Swans and make the finals. By the way, does everyone get annoyed when Adam Goodes always "stages" for free kicks ?' Warne wrote.    

Captain of the Australian cricket team and good friend Michael Clarke responded to his mate's comment with 'Goodes is a legend mate. Swans to win the flag champion.'

Warne then replied to Clarke with the baffling admission that he was surprised to discover Goodes was awarded Australian of the year for 2014 - which was awarded in January, almost eight months ago.

'I think Syd or the Hawks will win the flag. Shocked as I just found out Goodes was Aust of the year, wow ! Who votes for that?' Warne wrote in a bizarre tweet.

What followed was many puzzled punters asking what he meant by his comments, while other users were astounded he missed the news.

One wrote to Warne 'So much respect gone for you. Use to like you but you're actually a flog. Can't believe I looked up to you as a kid.'

Others joked that they thought the former cricketer's account to be a parody based on his recent comments, only to discover it wasn't.

On Sunday morning Adam Goodes responded to the exchange as he pointed out that Australian cricketer and one of Warne's former teammates Adam Gilchrist, is the head of the Australia Day Council.

Michael Clarke also responded that Shane Warne could be the next Australian of the Year

'@ShaneWarne thanks for your support mate maybe ask @gilly381 who votes for it he is the chair of the Australia Day Council'. Goodes wrote.

Warne then repeated his initial advice for Goodes to stop diving, and wished the Swans star luck for the upcoming finals.

'@adamroy37 Just stop staging for free kicks mate. You should be better than that as Aust of the year !!! Good luck in the finals', Warne tweeted.

Some twitter users threw their support behind Warne over the strange sentiments, while many other people were astounded by the comments made by the former cricketer.

One user commended Goodes on his response and wrote: 'Well done Adam, so tired of ppl (people) undermining your achievements'.
