Lurid claims that French First Lady 
Valerie Trierweiler cheated on her former husband with Ttwo lovers at 
once have been heard in a court in Paris today.

The 47-year-old girlfriend of President Francois Hollande is suing two authors who made the allegations for invasion of privacy.

The biography called The Troublemaker
 claims she was the shared mistress of Mr Hollande, 58, and former 
conservative minster Patrick Devidjian, now 68, while she was still 
married to Denis Trierweiler nine years ago.

Legal fight: Frances first lady Valerie Trierweiler is suing the authors of a book over claims she was a 'shared' 
mistress of President Francois Hollande and conservative ex-minister Patrick Devidijan

Menage a trois: It is alleged in the book that left-wing President Hollande knew
 he was 'sharing' Ms Trierweiler with Patrick Devidjian during their 
affair nine years ago

Both men knew they were 'sharing' Ms 
Trierweiler, but when Mr Devidjian refused her demands to leave his 
wife, she chose her affair with Mr Hollande over him, before finally 
divorcing her husband in 2010, the book says.

Ms Trierweiler is demanding £35,000 in damages for invasion of privacy from the authors Christophe 
Jakubyszyn and Alix Bouilhaguet, both TV journalists.

Rumour: Patrick Devedjian allegedly had an affair with Valerie Trierweiler

For legal reasons, her separate action for defamation is to be heard at a later hearing.

When the case first came before a 
court in December, Mr Hollande was accused of a huge abuse of his powers
 by personally writing to the judge to defend his live-in lover.

In the hand-written letter, the 
president called the claims 'pure fabrication', adding: 'This has no 
place in an account of politicial events unless it is presented as 
fiction.'

But furious defence lawyer Olivier 
Pardo told the judge in open court: 'The separation of powers has been 
violated. The President is the guardian of the independence of the 
judiciary.
  We are swimming in madness.'

Ms Trierweiler is facing a separate 
bizarre legal action in France over claims the taxpayer should not be 
supporting her lifestyle as the 'president's mistress'.

Supermarket chain heir Xavier Kemlin 
launched the highly unusual criminal complaint last week, telling French
 media: 'It scandalous that our taxes are being used to house, feed, 
upkeep and pay for the staff and travel of a lady to whom we have no 
legal obligation.'

Ms Trierweiler also recently sued a 
French magazine for publishing photos of her in her bikini while on 
holiday with Mr Hollande last summer - but was awarded only the 
'minimum' £5,000 in damages.

The First Lady was also at the centre
 of accusations last year she tried to wreck the political career of 
Segolene Royal - the mother of Mr Hollande's four children.

She sparked national outrage when she
 tweeted her support for a candidate standing against Ms Royal in a 
by-election. Ms Royal lost and said she had been 'stabbed in the back' 
by Mr Hollande's girlfriend.

Ms Trierweiler also faced humiliation in November when her boss at the French magazine where she works said he wanted to sack her.

Glossy weekly Paris Match's owner 
Arnaud Lagardere described her as 'an unpinned grenade' who has caused 
him 'nothing but trouble' and said he would not be renewing her contract
 this year.

A separate book about Ms Trierweiler 
called Between Two Fires, by investigative journalist Anna Cabana 
describes her 'a cocktail of jealousy, vengeance and political 
calculation'.

And a third book about her called The Favorite by journalist
 Laurent Greilsamer also writes: 'As I see it, you have shown yourself 
to be snooty, infatuated, explosive, unpredictable. And 
visibly dangerous.'

Outspoken French MP Bernard Debre 
issued another dramatic put-down of Ms Trierweiler after she gave her 
public support for gay marriages.

He wrote on his website: 'Madame 
Trierweiler, self-proclaimed First Lady, is only the President's 
girlfriend, and after the blunders she has already made, it would be 
much better if she shut up.'
