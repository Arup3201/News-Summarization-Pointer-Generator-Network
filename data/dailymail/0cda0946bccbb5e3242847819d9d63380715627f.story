Traditional favourite toy Lego is the top of most children’s Christmas lists in their letters to Santa this year, postal bosses revealed yesterday.

Royal Mail analysed over 200,000 letters from UK youngsters to produce a ‘top ten’ based on their wish lists - with surprising results.

The age-old favourite - invented in 1949 - beat modern rivals like Peppa Pig and Microsoft’s Xbox One console to take the Christmas crown.

Demand for the multi-coloured building blocks was so high it even pushed One Direction merchandise into second place among this year’s most wanted.

And the Furby - widely hailed as 2013’s ‘must-have’ Christmas item - only managed third place in the list.

Surprisingly, the Xbox was the only tech item to make an appearance, with computer tablets, handheld consoles and Sony’s rival Playstation 4 all absent.

Dolls also proved a hit for girls with Monster High characters and Sofia Talking Doll taking fifth and sixth place.

But some traditional toys did not fare so well - bikes and teddy bears did not feature in the list.

For 50 years British kids have been able to write to the North Pole using the address 'Santa’s Grotto, Reindeerland, XM4 5HQ.'

Beaten: The Xbox one was not as popular as the age-old toy

A team of helpers opens their letters by hand before they are forwarded to St. Nick’s Arctic HQ - and this year they also analysed the letters in a bid to find out what kids really want.

Chief of Santa’s mailbag, Alex McConnell, leads the teams responsible for handling Christmas post.

He said: 'Santa allowed us to take a peek at what children are asking for this year and it seems that they clearly still love making and building things with timeless Lego taking top place as this year’s most wanted Christmas present.'

The Furby is expected to be this year’s sell-out Christmas success with many retailers reporting low stocks.

Toys R’ Us has limited orders on the revamped Furby Boom! to two-per-customer as sales pick up in the run-up to December 25.

Children can interact with the new edition of the alien-like creature - which first stormed toyshops in 1998 - via smartphone and tablet apps.
