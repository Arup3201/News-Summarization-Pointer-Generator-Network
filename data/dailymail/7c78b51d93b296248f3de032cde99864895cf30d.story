Doctors at a Northern California hospital say a couple has given birth to a rare set of naturally conceived identical triplets.

Abby, Brin and Laurel Hepner were born November 22 at Sutter Memorial Hospital to Hannah and Tom Hepner, of Quincy.

The triplets were produced when a single, fertilized egg split into three.

Grab a hold of this! Brindabella holds the finger of her father, Tom. The triplets were produced when a single, fertilized egg split into three - a one-in-a-million chance especially considering the triplets were conceived naturally

Dr. William Gilbert, director of Sutter Women's Services, says the odds of producing identical triplets without fertility drugs range from 1-in-1-million to 1-in-100-million.

He said the rarity makes it difficult to more accurately calculate the frequency of such births.

Abby weighed 3 pounds, 2 ounces; Brin 3 pounds, 11 ounces; and Laurel 4 pounds.

'It is not unusual with identical triplets to have a difference in weight,' said Dr Gilbert. 'They usually don’t share equal amounts of the placenta so therefore one gets a little less nutrition than the other.

When you have a difference in weight, the little one does better after they are born because the stress of being little matures your lungs faster.'

Third time lucky: Parents Hannah and Tom Hepner from Quincy, California gave birth to their three girls thanks to a rarely seen act of nature; a single fertilized egg split into three, producing three babies who are close to exactly alike

Welcome to the world! Abby, Brin, and Laurel Hepner ¿ were born at Sutter Memorial Hospital in late November. Doctors there said that identical triplets are exceedingly rare

Badge of honor: Abby weighed 3 pounds, 2 ounces; Brin 3 pounds, 11 ounces; and Laurel 4 pounds. The triplets are still in the hospital until they can maintain body temperature and eat properly

'The end of the year is going to be big in our families I guess,' Tom said.

Hannah Hepner was taken via helicopter to Sutter Memorial Hospital a month before her daughters were born to receive treatment from a team of specialists. Sutter features a program that helps 'mothers of multiples' cope with their pregnancies, the hospital said.

The baby’s names are all tied to family or special places in mom and dad’s lives.

'Brindabella is the mountain range where I grew up in Australia, where we were married,' Tom said.

'When we first found out, we just sort of laughed in that nervous way,' Hannah Hepner said. 'It's overwhelming to think of everything that's to come.'

Try doing this with triplets! A California couple got an early Christmas gift. Hannah and Tom Hepner are the proud parents of triplets. They're extremely rare babies because they were conceived naturally without the help of fertility drugs

Now which one is this? Hopefully the parents will be able to keep tabs on who is who. This baby girl has a birth mark on her forehead so that could be a help!

Dr. William Gilbert at Sutter Memorial Hospital says this sort of birth is rare — so rare that he couldn't give definite odds on it happening without fertility treatments.

'First one I've seen in 30 years of doing this,' he said.

He estimates it's somewhere between one-in-a-million and one-in-200-million odds.

Gilbert says the triplets are doing better than expected and should be able to go home in just a few weeks.

'They're going to go to kindergarten, graduate from high school, bring home bad boys,' Gilbert said.

Everything times three. And for now, the couple says there aren't any other babies planned anytime soon.

'This is more than we bargained for,' Hannah Hepner said. 'I think we're good.'

Quietly confident: Even though as parents they're outnumbered, both and Hannah think they'll be able to cope... no problem!
