It was a moment she had dreamed of since she was a girl and saw her claim Britain’s first medal in a snow event at the Winter Olympics in 90 years.

But for many, Jenny Jones’s bronze in the snowboarding slopestyle final was marred by the BBC commentary.

The corporation was forced to apologise after more than 300 viewers complained.

Commentators Ed Leigh and Tim Warwood were labelled ‘immature idiots’ for whooping and cheering as Miss Jones competed in Sochi, Russia, on Sunday.

Apology: Hundreds of viewers complained that the BBC had spoiled Jenny Jones's Olympic bronze medal success and branded commentators including snowboarder Aimee Fuller 'puerile and hyperactive'

The pair, who were joined by Miss 
Jones’s friend and fellow snowboarder Aimee Fuller, repeatedly talked 
over each other and appeared to celebrate when her Austrian rival Anna 
Glasser fell, ensuring 33-year-old Miss Jones a medal.

At
 one point Miss Fuller yelled ‘Go on the Jones!’, while Warwood said ‘I 
can’t look, someone else commentate’ as she was about to start her run.

When
 Miss Glasser fell, the BBC team erupted into cheers and Miss Fuller 
screamed: ‘Jones gets bronze. Can I stand on my chair now?’ 

The cheering became so loud that Miss Fuller herself remarked: ‘Whoa, are we supposed to do that? Probably not.’

In
 one exchange as Miss Jones, from Bristol, waited for her score, Leigh 
said: ‘I can feel my pulse in my lower intestine.’ Warwood replied: 
‘That’s not your pulse, Ed.’

Crude: Mr Leigh also referred to Olympic hero Jenny's reaction to winning the bronze - telling viewers she 'had a face that can help bread rise'

Shock: Jenny Jones realises her parents, who she believed were at home, were in the crowd as she competed, pictured left. She immediately rushed over to give them a hug, pictured right

A
 total of 303 complained to the BBC about the coverage. Writing on the 
BBC’s own Points Of View messageboard, one viewer said: ‘Shame, the 
Jones medal overshadowed by immature idiots.’

Another criticised the ‘shrieking with joy at the fall of a non-GB athlete’.

A
 BBC spokesman said: ‘This was a truly historic occasion for Team GB and
 the commentary team were understandably very excited. However, we 
acknowledge that on occasion this excitement got the better of them.’

American Jamie Anderson took 
gold in the event with 95.25, ahead of Finland’s Enni Rukajarvi on 92.50. The three 
medal winners shouted their delight and hugged as the final competitor 
failed to match their scores.

Success: Miss Jones beams as she reaches the foot of the slope

Jones had previously been world champion and had won 
three gold medals at the Winter X Games but had never previously 
competed at the Olympics as the snowboard slopestyle event was making 
its Olympic debut.

Miss 
Jones was the oldest competitor in the final by six years and had not 
even picked up a snowboard until she was 17 when she visited a dry ski 
slope.

And she had 
been forced to put her preparations for the games on hold over Christmas
 after she suffered a concussion during training.

She
 confessed that she has slept with the medal under her pillow and that 
the reality of her win was only just 'starting to sink in a little bit.'

Tumble: Despite repeatedly telling viewers how sporting snowboarding rivals were, the presenters distastefully cheered when Miss Jones's main competitor Anna Gasser suffered a fall

But her victory has been slightly overshadowed by criticism of the coverage of the event.

Fuming viewers took to Twitter to vent their frustration at the commentary team - with some admitting they had been forced to switch the sound off.

Paul Morton wrote: 'I thought I’d tuned into CBeebies or “Grange Hill does Val d’ISere” by mistake, turned out to be BBC’s #Slopestyle commentators #myeardrums.'

Another twitter user, simply called Helena added: 'Want a refund on the bit of my licence fee paying for the appalling slopestyle commentators. They’re a disgrace.'

Nick Blacow wrote: 'Deary me can the @BBCSport slopestyle commentators please get a grip you are working for the BBC for god’s sake!'

And user Adam Yates added: 'Never heard such puerile hyperactive guff in my life. BBC should axe those three clowns immediately. Had to mute coverage.'

Precious: Miss Jones confessed today that she had slept with the medal under her pillow last night and that the reality of her win was only just 'starting to sink in a little bit'

Pumped: Jones poses with her parents who surprised her at the ceremony

Other viewers were offended by the sexual innuendos the commentary team used, including joking about a competitor having 'slugs in her knickers'.

Mr Leigh and Mr Warwood also collapsed into fits of infantile giggles when they joked about 'pumping the fist in the commentary box' - slang for a sexual act.

Mr Leigh also referred to Olympic hero Miss Jones’s reaction to winning the bronze - telling viewers she 'had a face that can help bread rise'.

Mr Leigh, 39, has worked for the BBC presenting flagship snow sports show Ski Sunday since 2007 after previously working for Channel 4, while Mr Warwood presented CBBC show Wild! after a low-key career as a professional snowboarder.

One viewer said: 'It was awful, you would not have expected this in the heyday of BBC coverage, could you imagine Ski Sunday commentators reacting like that?'

Amir Adhamy added: 'So just popped online to see people’s reactions to the commentary, I cannot believe I’m alone in finding them unbearably annoying.

'They’re like hungover teenagers, talking over each other and yelping. It’s giving me a headache - I came here to zone out and watch people in hyper trendy fluffy clothes do cool stuff in snow. Ugh. Call me a naysayer.'

Winners: Enni Rukajarvi, Jamie Anderson and Jenny Jones pose on the podium at their medal ceremony

Apres-ski? British snowboarder Jenny Jones tweeted this, suggesting she might have gone out celebrating after her win. Viewers were frequently told about the sportsmanship among snowboarders

Father-of-one Graham Carr tweeted: 'Just been watching BBC coverage of snowboarding with my 6-yr-old son. He just asked what ‘pumping the fist’ meant. Disgusting BBC.'

Another Twitter user Melanie wrote: 'Wish BBC snowboarding commentary team get buried in avalanche. Cringing so much my face hurts. Can’t believe we pay their wages!'

However some viewers said they had enjoyed the raucous commentary. Twitter user Becca wrote: 'The BBC commentators on the women’s snowboard slopestyle are my favourite people ever.'

The BBC apologised, adding that 3.1million people had tuned in to watch Miss Jones win her Olympic medal, and that 53 people had submitted appreciations about the overall Winter Olympics coverage so far.
