Convicted child sex offender David Marker, 75, vanished from a hospital unit in Taunton, Somerset, yesterday morning

A
paedophile who has been held in secure hospital units for more than 45 years
has gone missing - for the third time.

Convicted
child sex offender David Marker, 75, vanished from a hospital unit in Taunton,
Somerset, yesterday morning.

Marker was
detained indefinitely in April 1965 for an indecent assault on a seven-year-old
girl.

He has been detained ever since.

Officers
from Avon and Somerset Police are now appealing for information to trace Marker - who is considered a risk due to his previous offending history.

Police
believe he may be in Weston-super-Mare following a sighting yesterday.

Marker
also gave two guards the slip in May 1998 on an escorted visit to a swimming
pool at Abraham Moss Leisure Centre in Crumpsall, Manchester.

The trip was part of a rehabilitation programme preparing him to be released back into the community.

At the time, the Department of Health
said a Mental Health Tribunal had sanctioned his conditional discharge 
after hearing evidence that he was of no threat to the public.

He was on the run
for almost 48 hours.

Marker was originally a patient at Broadmoor hospital. In 1993, he was transferred to Stockton Hall psychiatric hospital in North Yorkshire.

He had only recently been put into a 
special care unit in Manchester to see whether he was ready to move into
a more relaxed regime.

After his capture, he was sent back to Stockton Hall - and would later be moved to the Taunton unit.

It was
revealed he had escaped just months before the Manchester incident when he was on the run
for ten days, hiding out in a town 30 miles from York.

He was
able to create a false identity and had attempted to claim benefit payments
before he was discovered by chance by a member of the hospital staff.

Detective
Chief Inspector Nicholas Papucka said: 'David Marker is considered a risk
due to his previous offending history.

'If
you see David Marker, dial 999 immediately so that he can be returned to the
facility as soon as possible.'

Marker is
described as a white man, 5ft 9in tall, of stocky build with short cropped
dark to greying hair.

He has
grey stubble and wears glasses.

He was wearing a navy blue coat with yellow
patches around the collar and dark trousers and a white shirt.
