Stiff spliff: Barbara Stiff, 79, sold cannabis obtained by her dying daughter and used as 'pain relief'

A great-grandmother had been sentenced for drug dealing after Sydney police found 67 grams of cannabis in her suburban home.

Barbara Stiff, 79, claimed the drugs had been bought by her dying daughter as pain relief while she lived with her before her passing.

Ms Stiff admitted to police she had intended to sell the drugs as she had no use for them after her daughter’s death.

Ms Stiff was given a four-month suspended jail sentence when she appeared in Waverley Local Court on Wednesday after pleading guilty to drug supply and dealing with the suspected proceeds of crime.

Barrister William Barber told the court that Ms Stiff had allowed her unwell daughter to smoke cannabis in her home when she had lived with her.

‘She was in a great deal of pain and was using cannabis for pain relief,’ he said.

According to Ms Stiff, her daughter, who died last year, would obtain cannabis in bulk with other people in a ‘similar position’ in the public housing where they lived, Mr Barber said.

Police raided Ms Stiff's unit on June 27 last year and found 67 grams of cannabis in multiple locations around the home.

Mr Barber said the drugs had been there for a very long time and Stiff no longer had any use for the cannabis after her daughter's death.

During the raid, Sydney police found $295 in Ms Stiff’s wallet, which she admitted was from selling cannabis to six people.

Police also found $100 cash in a tin with cannabis split up into five bags, which Ms Stiff admitted that she planned to sell.

Cannabis was also found in a bag in a bedroom and another kitchen tin.

Magistrate Robbie Williams told the court that while it was not a sophisticated system, there was a clear system of supply.

He said police also found a ‘drug ledger’ at Stiff's house, with names and amounts of money listed.

The court was told that Wednesday marked nine months since Stiff's daughter had died.

Mr Barber said his client was embarrassed by the case, which had attracted wide media coverage, and that the housing commission was trying to remove her from her unit where she had been for more than 30 years.

Stiff received a four-month suspended jail sentence and a four-month good behaviour bond.

Outside court, Mr Barber said Stiff had been through a very difficult 12 months and was relieved that the case was over.
