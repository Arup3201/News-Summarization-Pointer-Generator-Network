Britain basked in glorious sunshine yesterday – with the country enjoying the hottest day of the year so far.

With temperatures soaring to above 17C – and winter seeming a distant memory – parts of the nation were warmer than Mediterranean hotspots Benidorm, Rome and even some of the Greek islands.

The mercury topped 17.5C (63.5F) in Murlough, Co Down, Northern Ireland, while in Santon Downham in Suffolk it hit 17.3C.

And with spring finally appearing to have sprung, thousands headed outdoors to enjoy the warmth.

Sun-seekers flocked to Hampton Court Palace in South West London and the sandy beach at Great Yarmouth in Norfolk – and Britain’s wildlife also made the most of the balmy temperatures.

In Central London, swarms of bees feasted on nectar and pollen in St James’s Park, where temperatures rose as high as 16.7C – well above average for this time of year.

Elsewhere, visitors in Cambridge punted along the River Cam, while at beauty spot Devil’s Dyke, just outside Brighton in East Sussex, horseriders and walkers explored the countryside.

And at Cornwall’s Crealy Great Adventure Park, near Wadebridge, one of the park’s meerkats ventured out to investigate a cravat-wearing toy of Russian meerkat Aleksandr Orlov from the TV adverts.

In yet another sign that spring is here, an abandoned newborn lamb was found by a passerby on a roadside in Slough, Berkshire.

Punting down the River Cam was a popular activity today as the country basked in temperatures about five degrees warmer than the average for this time of year

After being picked up by the un-named Good Samaritan, the baby lamb, nicknamed Larry naturally, was taken in by the Animal Sanctuary UK in Dorney. 

Diana Coad, head trustee of the sanctuary, said: ‘It was starving, exhausted and emaciated. There was no sign of its mother anywhere after searching for her.

‘He’s not fine but is a lot better than he was. He’s warm and fed and we just hope he will be OK.’

But forecasters warned the warm weather is likely to be short-lived, with more cloud and rain forecast for today and the rest of the week.

Blaise Castle, Bristol looked picturesque today as some of the warmest weather conditions of the year struck Britain

Craig Snell, at the Met Office, said last night: ‘It has been a very plea-sant day for many parts of the UK.

‘Most of the country has seen the warmest day of the year, with the exception of western Scotland, where it has been quite wet. As we go through tomorrow the rain will clear Scotland and make its way south towards England and Wales.

‘Temperatures will return to around average, with highs of 10C to 11C, cooling off a little bit but still not cold by any means, although tonight will be cold, with temperatures close to freezing in many spots if the sky is clear. This week will see quite changeable weather but nothing out of the ordinary for this time of year.’

Yellow ‘be aware’ and amber ‘be prepared’ warnings will be in place until this afternoon for heavy rain over western and central parts of Scotland, which may see up to 8in of rain over 36 hours. The worst hit so far is Glen Shiel in the Highlands, which had 4in in 24 hours up to midday yesterday.

The Met Office also warned of high winds in the far north of Northern Ireland and the whole of Scotland from tomorrow morning, with gusts expected to reach 70mph.

Bristol basked sunshine and there were in clear blue skies this afternoon, while temperatures in parts of the country inched past 17C

Temperatures in London and south east England are the warmest of the country today, forecasters say. Pictured is the sunrise over Gravesend this morning

This map shows the flowers preferred by mums around the country ahead of Mother's Day

... and here's the Bloom-ited Kingdom! 

by Sanchez Manning for The Mail on Sunday 

Baffled by which bloom to buy your mother next Sunday? This map might help. It shows the flowers preferred by mums around the country. So if yours lives in Manchester, go for orange tulips – but purple pansies are top in Aberystwyth.

The map was created for Mother’s Day on March 15 by Dobbies Garden Centres. The company quizzed women in 30 cities about their flower of choice.

They then created a 10ft map of the UK with 2,000 individual flowers showing which varieties each part of the country preferred.

Dobbies boss Andy King said: ‘We know mums love any gift on Mother’s Day, but this may help those who want to give things a little extra thought.’

In ten of the 30 cities surveyed – including Belfast and Leeds – mothers said they loved bright pink roses, while in London pink tulips were top choice.

In York, pink lilies are favourites while Wrexham, Coventry and Swansea were the only ones to opt for white lilies.

Roses and lilies were the most popular flowers nationwide, followed by tulips, pansies and orchids.

The full Top Ten is: 1: Pink roses; 2: Yellow roses; 3: Pink lilies; 4: Yellow tulips; 5: Orange lilies; 6: Pink tulips; 7: Pink orchids; 8: White lilies; 9: Purple pansies; 10: Orange tulips.
