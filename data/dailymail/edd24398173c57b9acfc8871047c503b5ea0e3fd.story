The girlfriend of a man charged with killing a University of New Hampshire student was released on bail today after appearing in court.

Kathryn McDonough, 19, was arrested on Christmas Eve after lying to investigators regarding the disappearance and death of 19-year-old Elizabeth ‘Lizzi’ Marriot in October.

McDonough, appearing in court today wearing a pale pink sweater and glasses, was released on $35,000 bond.

CBS Boston reports that McDonough 
agreed to several conditions of her release, including not having 
contact with her boyfriend, Seth Mazzaglia, who is charged with 
Marriot’s murder.

Mazzaglia, an aspiring 29-year-old 
actor, remains in police custody and is charged with the second dregree 
murder of 19-year-old Marriott even though her body has never been 
found.

McDonough, also 19, was dating Mazzaglia at the time and investigators believe that she is the connection between the seemingly wholesome Marriott and Mazzaglia who is thought to be a member of various online dating and bondage websites.

Marriott was a student at the University of New Hampshire, and her friends said that on the day that she disappeared, she had told them that she was going to visit a friend in a town called Dover.

McDonough- who lived in an apartment with Mazzaglia in Dover- and Marriott previously worked together at Target and became friends there.

Marriott's aunt said Lizzi loved marine biology, volunteered at the New England Aquarium in Boston and enjoyed reading the Harry Potter series and The Lord of the Rings trilogy with her younger brother.

McDonough was arrested on Christmas 
Eve for hindering apprehension or prosecution and conspiracy to commit 
hindering apprehension or prosecution, both of which are felony charges.

The Union Leader reports that 
McDonough was arrested- which comes two months after Mazzaglia was 
arrested for suffocating Marriot- because she lied about where she was 
on October 9 and 12. Her bail has been set at $35,000.

Marriott's body has not been recovered
 so far. Divers equipped with sonar and underwater cameras have been 
scouring the ocean for the teen.

'We truly believe she’s in the ocean, 
and we're just waiting for her to come back to shore,' said Dawn Downey 
of Westboro, a family friend.

Though the search was briefly called 
off, authorities have no focused their efforts on the waters around 
Peirce Island in nearby Portsmouth using both sonar technology to scan 
the bottom of the lake and cadaver dogs to try to pick up her scent.

Authorities in Maine and Massachusetts have also been asked to watch their shorelines in case  Marriott's body washes up.

But that was the last activity on her phone and her bank accounts have not been accessed since.

The suspect, Seth J. Mazzaglia is listed as living at apartment 341 in the complex of 1 Mill Street in Dover.

His website indicates that he is an 
'experienced actor, writer and fight choreographer' who stands 5 feet 9 
inches tall and weighs 220 pounds.

He claims that his 'special skills and
 talents' include a third degree black belt in Okinawan karate and that 
he is proficient with a samurai sword, butterfly swords and other hand 
held weapons.

Robert Modee, who is a Kittery, Maine,
 martial arts instructor, confirmed that Mazzaglia is an expert in 
karate and that he trained with the suspect for almost 20-years.

'He's been with me, training with me, since he was probably 10 or 12 years old,' Modee said.

As well as his expertise in 
hand-to-hand combat, Mazzaglia claimed to have performed in 17 theater 
productions between 2000 and 2010.

In 2005, Mazzaglia played the role of 
Richie Valens in a July performance of The Buddy Holly Story, at 
Seacoast Repertory Theater.

One former cast member, Brett Wulfson said she remembered Mazzaglia as a pleasant man, 'very involved with self-defense'.

According to The Portsmouth Herald, 
Mazzaglia had several accounts on online dating sites, including 
OKCupid.com, where his user name was listed as DarKaiser.

Another account of a 29-year-old 
DarKaiser was found on an S&M website described as 'the world's 
largest largest BDSM (bondage, discipline, dominance and submission, and
 sadomasochism) community and the most exciting bondage and fetish Web 
site.'

The user by the name DarKaiser wrote in his profile that he is 'a master seeking a slave.'

On another bondage website described 
as a Facebook 'run by kinksters,' a 29-year-old DarKaiser from New 
Hampshire wrote that he was looking for 'a lifetime relationship, a 
relationship; a play partner' princess by day, slut by night' and a 
sub.'

In addition, Mazzaglia claims to have a 750 hour certification in massage therapy awarded by McIntosh College in 2007.

Marriott was a 2011 graduate of 
Westborough High School in Massachusetts. She lived with an aunt in 
Chester and commuted to the Durham campus.
