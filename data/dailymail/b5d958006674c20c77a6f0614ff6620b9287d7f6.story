From cardboard Doctor Who Daleks to the entire Blue Peter studio set, an auction of BBC property has caused a frenzy among bidders desperate to own a piece of television history - with some lots going for more than £4,000.

Some 1,300 collectors' items have been up for grabs since the auction, hosted by Peaker Pattinson Ltd, opened on Wednesday and there are still a few hours left until the bids close today.

Among the most attractive lots was the entire Blue Peter studio, including set walls, four soft chairs and a bean bag, two large Blue 
Peter emblems and the iconic Blue Peter totaliser.

The lot opened at £10, but eventually sold for £2,350 after 70 bids.

Meanwhile one dedicated Ashes To Ashes fan paid a staggering £4,356 for a coat worn by DCI Gene Hunt, played by actor Philip Glenister, following a bidding war for the iconic black overcoat with a velvet collar.

Other popular Ashes to Ashes items
included a blood-soaked and tweed jacket, shirt and two ties worn by DCI
Hunt, which sold for £502 and another suit, with black shirt and 80s red tie, which sold for £720.

A ‘fake zebra coat’ by Karen Millen worn by DI Alex Drake, played by 
Keeley Hawes in the popular series, sold for £235.

One lucky fan also snapped up a full outfit worn by DI Drake, including a fake fur coat, white bag and two pearl necklaces, for £510.

Ashes to Ashes proved popular again when a leather jacket worn by thuggish DS Ray Carling - played by Dean Andrews - went for £320 after 50 bids.
