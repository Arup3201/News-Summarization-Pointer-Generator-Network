In the X Men films, Wolverine has mutant powers which mean he can heal himself - even when he’s shot, or thrown from a building.

And now researchers in the US are working on an implant that would make these superhuman powers a reality.

The ElectRx - pronounced 'electrics' - concept involves implanting tiny devices into patients’ bodies that use electric impulses to monitor and fix vital organs.

The ElectRx - pronounced electrics - project (illustrated) involves implanting tiny devices into patients’ bodies that use electric impulses to monitor and fix vital organs. Each implant would be so small, it could be injected into patients using a needle to target nerve endings

The program is being sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa).

Each implant would be so small, it could be injected into patients using a needle. 

As it is sits inside the body, the implant would use electric impulses to monitor the health of the body’s organs.

If it spots an organ is infected, injured or failing, it would stimulate the nerves needed to get the affected organ back to functioning effectively.

The idea behind the implant is based on the body’s natural monitoring system known as neuromodulation.

As it is sits inside the body, the implant would use electric impulses to monitor the health of the body’s organs.

If it spots that an organ is infected, injured or failing, it would stimulate the nerves needed to get the affected organ functioning effectively again.

The idea behind the implant is based on the body’s natural monitoring system known as neuromodulation.

In the body’s peripheral nervous system, neuromodulation monitors the status of organs and manages how they respond to disease.

But, when a person is sick or injured, this process can be weakened and doesn’t work as well as it should. 

In some cases, it can cause people to become more ill as the body fails to fight the infection.

The implant being proposed by Darpa would give this natural process a boost, and prevent it from going wrong.

Current medical neuromodulation devices are large and difficult to implant, but Darpa's implant would be small enough to target precise nerve endings.

In the X Men franchise, Wolverine (played by Hugh Jackman pictured) has mutant powers that means he can heal himself - even after being shot, or thrown from a building. Darpa's implant would work in a similar way to give the body’s natural monitoring and healing system, known as neuromodulation, a boost

‘The technology Darpa plans to develop through the ElectRx program could fundamentally change the manner in which doctors diagnose, monitor and treat injury and illness’ said Doug Weber, Darpa program manager.

‘Instead of relying only on medication - we envision a closed-loop system that would work in concept like a tiny, intelligent pacemaker. It would continually assess conditions and provide stimulus patterns tailored to help maintain healthy organ function, helping patients get healthy and stay healthy using their body’s own systems.’

Darpa claims the device would be used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury and even depression, for example.

The agency said it will release full technical details on ElectRx ‘in the coming months’.
