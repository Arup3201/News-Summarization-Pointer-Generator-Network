England team physio Gary Lewin will have ankle surgery in the UK this week following his freak accident while celebrating Daniel Sturridge's goal against Italy.

Lewin, who landed at Heathrow on Monday, suffered a fracture and dislocation of the ankle after tripping on the touchline.

A statement from the FA said: 'England team physiotherapist Gary Lewin will return to England this week for ankle surgery following his accident during the Italy match in Manaus.

'During the Daniel Sturridge goal 
celebration, Lewin caught his foot in the astro-turf and suffered a 
fracture and dislocation of the ankle. He was immediately treated in 
the dugout by England Doctor Ian Beasley.

'Lewin
 flew back from Manaus to Rio with the team on Saturday night and has 
been treated by the England medical staff at the Royal Tulip Hotel since
 the injury occurred. 

'He
 said: “I’m absolutely devastated to be going home.  A lot of hard work,
 planning and preparation has gone into this tournament.  England has a 
fantastic backroom staff who will continue to provide excellent support 
to the players and management.

'I’d
 like to thank my England colleagues and the FIFA medical officers at 
the Amazonia Arena for their excellent, professional treatment.  And of 
course, I wish the England team all the best for the rest of the 
tournament.”'

England Manager Roy Hodgson said: 'It’s
 very unfortunate for Gary and us that this accident occurred. We will 
of course miss him as he’s an extremely experienced and popular member 
of staff.  However, we wish him a speedy recovery and know he’ll be 
cheering us on from back home.'

England manager Roy Hodgson confirmed Lewin, 50, had suffered a fractured and dislocated ankle

The 37th minute incident saw Lewin 
receiving medical treatment from both FIFA officials and players before 
he was ushered down the tunnel on a distinctive orange stretcher.

‘Gary leapt into the air as Sturridge scored and everyone was leaping about,’ said one England source.

Another source said: ‘On the flight home a few of the lads joked with him that 
he was the one supposed to be looking after them – not the other way 
round.

‘As soon as it happened Frank Lampard was one of the first players who went to help him.

‘Gary has been a little sheepish about the whole thing.’

Last night Lewin’s daughter Rebecca confirmed her father had left hospital, adding:  ‘He is just gutted really.’

Former
 England captain Rio Ferdinand was forced to apologise after tweeting: 
‘What happened to running it off??? Our physio has to man up!!’

Less
 than an hour later he tweeted again: ‘Just found out that Gary Lewin’s 
injury was serious so apologies for previous tweets on the injury. My 
bad.’

The FA statement continued: 'England v Italy was Lewin’s 205th 
match as physio for the senior England team.  He was brought into the 
England set-up by manager Glenn Hoddle in 1996 and became a full-time FA
 staff member in 2008 following a long career at Arsenal Football Club, 
where he was senior team physio for over 1,200 matches.

'Lewin
 has worked with the Three Lions at five FIFA World Cups and was physio 
for the Great Britain football team at the 2012 London Olympics.

'England’s other physio Steve Kemp will remain in the camp and oversee this area in Lewin’s absence.

'The FA and Gary Lewin will make no further comment at this time and kindly asks the media to respect his family’s privacy.'

The injury to Lewin comes just days after Roy Hodgson’s assistant Ray Lewington had emergency knee surgery before England’s warm-up friendly in Miami.

Lewington arrived at the Royal Tulip team hotel in Rio de Janeiro last week using a pair of crutches.
