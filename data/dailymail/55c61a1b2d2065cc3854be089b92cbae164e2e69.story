A Malaysia Airlines steward has been sacked after allegedly sexually assaulting a female passenger he was comforting because she was scared of flying with the disaster-struck airline.

The 57-year-old, named by the victim as Mohammed Rosli Bin Ab Karim, has been in a detention centre at Charles de Gaulle Airport, France, since August.

Laura Bushney, 26, claims she was sitting at the back of Flightt MH20 when she asked Karim how long they had left before they landed.

Miss Bushney said Karim then sat down next to her on the pretext of comforting her, before putting her legs up on to his lap and putting his hand into her pants. 

Laura Bushney, 26, says she was sexually assaulted on a Malaysia Airlines flight by a 57-year-old attendant who sat next to her on the pretence of comforting her

The airline confirmed in a statement that the crew member was no longer an employee but declined to comment on the allegation of assault.

A spokesman said: 'Malaysia Airlines is not at liberty to comment on the matter as it is currently under the judicial purview of the authorities.'

At the time of the attack, Miss Bushney was on the way  to Paris to visit her boyfriend.

She says Mohammed Rosli Bin Ab Karim (pictured) carried out the attack on Flight MH20. Malaysia Airlines has confirmed an employee has been sacked, but refused to discuss the issue further

She previously told the Channel Seven Sunday Night show that Karim sat down next to her and began his attack by running his hand down her stomach.

She pushed his hands away, but he would not leave, and started massaging her legs instead.

Karim did eventually leave the seat, but returned half an hour later when he again moved her legs on to his and began touching her.

She said: 'I could feel that he has got an erection and he is rubbing himself up against me. He put his hands inside my pants…He put his fingers inside me.' 

Ismail Nasaruddin, president of the National Union of Flight Attendants Malaysia, said Karim was sacked by a letter on August 22 two weeks after the purported incident took place.

However, he branded the sacking unfair, saying Karim had not yet been found guilty of a crime and was not given a hearing.

He added: 'What Malaysia Airlines did is a clear violation of natural justice. There has not been any hearing so far for the crew who is being held in Paris.

'Malaysia Airlines fired the crew based on the allegation. 'They judged him guilty before the trial. This is unjust.'

Ismail urged French authorities to allow the man to return home if there was insufficient evidence to charge him, since his wife and three children are under emotional and financial stress.

He added: 'We have to ensure this crew gets some justice. Why punish the crew when he is not found guilty?'

Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 disappeared mysteriously in March with 239 people aboard, en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

To date no trace of the plane has been found despite extensive searches, and the airline has been widely criticised for its handling of the crisis.

The woman said she told stewards at the beginning of the flight that she was scared of travelling with the airline following the disappearance of MH370 and the shooting down of MH17 (pictured) earlier this year

On July 17, MH17 was shot down over Ukraine with 298 people killed after being hit by a surface-to-air missile which is believed to have been fired by Russian-back rebel troops.

The disasters have left the Malaysian national carrier on the brink of financial ruin. 

The state investment fund which controls the company plans to privatise the airline in the hopes of injecting life back into it.
