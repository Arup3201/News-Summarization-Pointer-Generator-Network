The fugitive gay-porn star suspected of being a cannibal harboured murderous fantasies towards people and animals one of his transsexual lovers has revealed.

Luka Magnotta, 29, dated Nina Arsenault for a short time a decade ago, but left an indelible impression on the 38-year-old prostitute and journalist.

'I'm afraid that when you look into my eyes...that you'll see that there's nothing inside of me,' said Magnotta to Arsenault after they first met when he worked as a stripper in Toronto.

Nina Arsenault was the lover of Luka Magnotta around a decade ago and has revealed the porn star and suspected cannibal was deeply disturbed even then

Speaking to CityTV as a trans-Atlantic manhunt closed in on her former lover, Arsenault described the suspected murderer as a 'manipulative pathological liar - one f****d-up kid.'

Having filmed himself chopping up his current lover before posting body parts to politicians in Canada, Magnotta is now being hunted in Europe after French police admitted he landed in Paris and could even now be on the run in London.

He fled after the torso of a man identified as Chinese student Lin Jun was found outside his Montreal apartment and a video was recovered from the scene.

It allegedly showed Magnotta killing Jun with an ice pick, cutting him up, sexually abusing him and then eating him with a knife and fork.

Nina Arsenault spoke in a television interview in Toronto after the manhunt for Magnotta moved to France

Meeting Magnotta at a strip club around ten years ago, Arsenault said that the suspected murderer and cannibal pursued her as a lover

In the interview, Arsenault spoke of how Magnotta would start fights on the street with strangers and punch himself in the head while taking a shower

Transsexual Arsenault, who has spent up to $150,000 Canadian dollars on sex change operations, met Magnotta when he was 18.

'I first met him as Angel, but then he told me his real name is Luka — and he also referred to himself as Rocco,' said Arsenault.

'He was my very first lover after I started living as a transsexual.

'He would joke about killing animals.

'He would joke about killing people — that he wanted to kill his family.'

The freelance writer also admitted that Magnotta would get high on mind-bending drugs and was obsessed with Madonna and James Dean and woud do 'anything' to be famous himself.

She described odd behaviour from Magnotta, such as punching himself in the head while he was in the shower and posessing a temper and 'if it went on it was terrifying.'

'He hated his dad. He hated his family and said they didn't understand him and he had to get away from him,' added Arsenault.

As Magnotta evaded police in Canada and France, the Montreal police chief Ian Lafreniere predicted that Magnotta's addiction to celebrity will cause him to make a mistake.

With the ability to disguise himself as a woman, Luka Magnotta has evaded arrest by police in Canada and France for almost a week

'What will hinder him the most is what he used to glorify himself on the web, with all the photos we have of him,' said Lafreniere.

The chief added, 'Magnotta is someone who can disguise himself - he can change into a woman, wear a wig.'

Because of this, police released a sketch that showed how he would look as a woman with long dark hair and sporting a fringe.

As police scoured the apartment that Magnotta lived in, police chief Lafreniere confirmed that he had left Montreal by air on Saturday and arrived in Paris the next day.

'We’re not going to give you his final destination because we believe he could be anywhere at this point,' said Lafreniere.

'We’re engaged in a worldwide search — more than 190 countries are helping us.'

French detectives have told the Mail that Magnotta took a flight to Paris on Saturday.

Luka Magnotta is wanted in connection with the gruesome murder of gay Chinese student Jun Lin

'He’s obsessed with the Eiffel Tower and the Moulin Rouge and is confident that he can lie low in a country he loves. All efforts are being made to arrest him.'

Luka Magnotta, who is suspected of cannibalism, flew from Canada to France a day after placing gruesome footage of the murder on the internet.

Police fear the gay porn star may now have slipped into Britain. Six months ago, he was living in a £40-a-night room above the Fusilier Inn in Wembley, North London, while sightseeing in the capital.

Magnotta told Nina Arsenault that he was interested in the idea of killing animals and people

While in the UK, he was confronted by 
journalists after posting internet film showing a live kitten being fed 
to a snake. In an email to The Sun in December he supposedly said: ‘You 
will be hearing from me again. This time, however, the victims won’t be 
small animals.’ He sent a similar warning to the BBC.

As 190 countries joined in 
an Interpol manhunt for  Magnotta, his victim was identified as Lin Jun,
a Chinese student who was studying in Montreal.

Police said Mr Lin, 33, was in a relationship with Magnotta, 29.

French detectives have told the Mail 
that Magnotta took a flight to Paris on Saturday. The murder is said to 
have taken place the night before. The victim’s foot arrived in the post
at the Conservative Party headquarters in Ottawa on Tuesday and a hand 
was also sent to the country’s Liberal Party.

A French detective said: ‘He’s 
obsessed with the Eiffel Tower and the Moulin Rouge and is confident 
that he can lie low in a country he loves. All efforts are being made to
arrest him.’

Montreal police commander Ian 
Lafreniere said investigators are now scouring the internet in case 
Magnotta – who has posted extensively on social networking sites – has 
bragged about his escape from justice. He also warned that the fugitive 
is ‘someone who can disguise himself; he can change into a woman, wear a
wig.’

Police say Mr Lin had been in Montreal since July last year and was studying at Concordia University.

His family lost contact with him on May 24.

Days later a janitor found his 
limbless body in a suitcase near Magnotta’s apartment in the city. Other
body parts were found in the  flat. The video of the killing is called 
‘1 Lunatic 1 Ice Pick’ and shows a man tied to a bed frame being hacked 
with a kitchen knife and the ice pick.

'Killer': Magnotta is believed to have fled the country on May 26 after the killing on the night of May 24 - 25

The victim’s throat is slashed and he is stabbed before being decapitated and dismembered.

The killer also appears to eat some of the flesh.

As in the movie American Psycho,  about a New York serial killer, the gruesome footage is set to the New Order song, True Faith.

Magnotta, who also uses the names Eric
Clinton Newman and Vladimir Romanov, is said to have once dated Karla 
Homolka, a notorious Canadian sex killer who slaughtered schoolgirls.

Nina Arsenault, a transsexual who 
dated Magnotta a decade ago, yesterday told Canadian media that his 
anger came from problems with his family.

She said that after they met in a 
strip club they dated for only three weeks because Magnotta was so 
unstable he would pick fights in the street.

She said: ‘He hated his dad. He hated his family and said they didn’t understand him and he had to get away from him.’
