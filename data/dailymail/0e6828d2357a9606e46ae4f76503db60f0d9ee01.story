She managed to break a jungle record by attempting five Bushtucker trials and failing to win a single meal and even revealed she couldn't even dry her own hair.

But sadly for Helen Flanagan fans her stint in the jungle has come to an end after the 22-year-old actress was voted out by the public on Monday evening.

After climbing out of camp Ant and Dec told Helen, who was famous for playing 'dozy' Rosie in Coronation Street: 'You've frustrated us, but we've loved you'.

After apologising for just waking up,
the former Coronation Street star said she would miss camp because 
she's become so close to everyone.

She also asked if she could have a pillow because she was going to 'cringe' when looking back at her best bits.

When the presenters spoke to Helen about her tough time in the camp she admitted she had underestimated just how tough it would be.

She explained that her fear of heights, which was tested upon arrival with a bridge task, left her lacking confidence.

Helen did say that she was proud of herself for managing to get some stars during her stint in the jungle.

When
Ant and Dec told her she had set a new record after failing to get any 
stars after being nominated for five trials, Helen exclaimed: 'This is 
so humiliating.'

Helen backed David Haye saying she would 'love' to see him win the show.

Helen made her way across the exit bridge with a glass of champagne in hand to be greeted by her mother Julia.

The reunion proved a little bit too much for Helen who seemed a little overcome by it all.

And it appears that Helen Flanagan's 
chest has a strange power after the soap star revealed she goes up a cup
size every time she eats.

On
Monday night's episode of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here the WAG
was parading her big bust around the jungle in a leopard print bra, 
when she explained her special talent.Â 

Magic boobs: Helen Flanagan told her camp mates that her breasts grow every time she eats

She told Ashley Roberts and 
Hugo Taylor: 'Seriously, I go up a cup size when I eat after dinner and 
then it goes down again later.'

The former Pussycat Doll replied: 'I wish I did that - I would eat all the time! I would be snacking all day.'

The conversation had turned to Helen's breasts after she tried to wear a big leopard print bra instead of a bikini.

Hands on: The former Coronation Street star's chest looked huge in the leopard print bra and Ashley couldn't resist having a feel

Can I get away with this? Helen asked her camp mates if the bra could pass for swimwear

The lingerie item boasted large cups which made Helen's cleavage look even bigger than normal.

Helen asked Charlie Brooks if she could get away with wearing her underwear instead of swimwear.

She said: 'Does this look like a bikini top? Do you think I can get away with it?'

Not convinced: Charlie Brooks suggested that maybe Helen could pull the look off but later admitted she was jealous of Helen's curves

You look silly: Hugo Taylor broke the news to Helen that she looked a little ridiculous in her bra

Charlie replied: 'Erm, well I suppose it does.'

The
EastEnders star was clearly a little envious of Helen's well-endowed 
shape and told viewers: 'The bra seems to have elevated and enhanced her
breasts by about four sizes. I mean, bitch! I am just jealous.'

Hugo Taylor couldn't help but notice Helen's outfit and asked her whose bra she was wearing.

He told her: 'It's huge.

He added: 'I think the leopard print bra is a little too much it's a little OTT for me.'

Jungle necessity: Helen was seen teaming the leopard print bra with bright red lips

Wild thing: Helene was seen pulling her hair band out as she paraded her shape around camp

Ashley was also shocked by the 
appearance of Helen's chest and she told her: 'Your t**s look freaking 
gi-normous. They look huge, I mean, wow.'

The American singer couldn't keep her hands off Helen's chest and helped herself to a feel.

Hugo decided to tell Helen she looked ridiculous and said: 'It looks a bit silly if you want my honest opinion.'

'If you like big bazonkas in your face then they are pretty hard to miss.'

After capturing her reflection in the Bushtucker Telegraph Helen decided she couldn't really get away with the outfit.

She
said: 'Oh they do look a bit big to be honest, I didn't actually 
realise, Oh dear, maybe I think I will change - they do look a bit 
ridiculous.
