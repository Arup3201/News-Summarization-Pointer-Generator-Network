Rupert Murdoch was banned from the star-studded birthday party of his public relations mogul son-in-law Matthew Freud in a tit-for-tat family conflict linked to Tony Blair’s relationship with Mr Murdoch’s ex-wife Wendi Deng.

And last night Mr Murdoch and Mr Freud were embroiled in a public war of words as the repercussions of the Blair-Deng controversy spread.

The latest development came after The Mail on Sunday learned that Mr Freud, married to Mr Murdoch’s daughter Elisabeth, axed his father-in-law from the guest list for his 50th birthday party last month.

It was the latest, dramatic sign of Mr Freud’s support for Mr Blair in the former Prime Minister’s own dispute with Mr Murdoch, who divorced Ms Deng three months ago.

The way they were: The now fragmented and warring Murdoch-Freud alliance pose for a family snap back in 2008

The Freud party snub came after Mr Murdoch had Mr Blair barred from attending a media summit in the US after finding a note suggesting Ms Deng had a ‘crush’ on him and discovering the pair had spent weekends at Mr Murdoch’s homes without his knowledge.

Mr Blair and wife Cherie were star guests at Mr Freud’s celebrity-studded party at his Oxfordshire mansion, with his father-in-law conspicuously absent.

A long-standing friend of Mr Murdoch said Mr Freud’s move was  ‘a very public V-sign to Rupert’.

And in a surprise move, both men intervened publicly last night, in a courteous but loaded exchange.Mr Freud confirmed he had fallen out with Mr Murdoch, saying their views ‘differed dramatically’ on several issues, causing ‘conflict’ between them.

They both loved Elisabeth, Mr Freud’s wife and Mr Murdoch’s daughter, he said, adding pointedly ‘if not always each other’.

Close friends: Matthew Freud with Tony Blair

And Mr Freud bluntly challenged the claim that Mr Murdoch was upset to be excluded from the party, saying: ‘He has said nothing to me personally.’

But a source close to Mr Murdoch hit back, saying: ‘Matthew and Rupert have no relationship and so none of this is a surprise.’

Other sources close to Mr Murdoch last night accused Mr Freud of cultivating Mr Murdoch’s ex-wife Wendi to antagonise him. And they say the Murdoch-Freud battle has affected Mr Murdoch’s relationship with daughter Elizabeth.

The family infighting comes after The Mail on Sunday revealed the link between Mr Blair’s relationship with Ms Deng and the Murdochs’ marriage breakdown – and how it caused a ‘terminal’ rift in relations between Mr Murdoch and Mr Blair.

Mr Blair denies he had an affair with Ms Deng. A source at Mr Murdoch’s News International company in the UK said: ‘Rupert is particularly upset that Matthew and Elisabeth held a party at exactly the time when rumours were circulating about Wendi and Blair.

Rupert wasn’t invited but Blair was. That was a very public V-sign to Rupert.

‘Freud has been sending crazy 3am emails to Rupert making all sorts of accusations. Elisabeth is stuck in the middle and it has had a devastating effect on her relations with Rupert.’

Mr Murdoch’s supporters claim Mr Freud ‘joined forces’ with Ms Deng in his own battle with Mr Murdoch.

‘He set out to cultivate her as an ally, saying all sorts of negative stuff to her about Rupert,’ a friend said. In addition, the Murdoch camp accuse Mr Freud of orchestrating  a ‘briefing war’ against him after Mr Murdoch’s fury with Mr Blair was revealed.

‘Rupert believes the stuff reported in the Press about him being a sad old man who has lost the plot has been put out there by Matthew,’ said one source. ‘The galling thing for Rupert is that when Matthew married Elisabeth, he cashed in on the Murdoch name. Now he is going around trashing Murdoch.’

Four months before Freud’s birthday bash, it was Mr Blair who was missing when he was ‘disinvited’ from the high-profile Sun Valley media conference in Idaho, after Mr Murdoch told organisers he would boycott it if Mr Blair turned up.

The Freud-Murdoch dispute is the latest development in the fast spreading fall-out between Murdoch and Mr Blair over Ms Deng, which has sent shockwaves through their close-knit and wealthy social circle.

Mr Murdoch discovered his wife had 'multiple encounters' with Mr Blair, including weekend strays at Mr Murdoch's US homes without his knowledge

Persistent reports that their 14-year marriage was in trouble came to a head earlier this year when Mr Murdoch discovered his wife had ‘multiple encounters’ with Mr Blair, including weekend strays at Mr Murdoch’s US homes without his knowledge. Weeks later, Mr Murdoch filed for divorce.

Friends of Mr Blair stress that he was ‘not cited in the divorce proceedings’.

Mr Freud, 50, is one of the most powerful and best connected men in Britain. He and Elisabeth, who he married in 2001, have a joint fortune of £250 million.

The success of Mr Freud, great grandson of psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, owes much to his pragmatic approach to business and politics – aided by generous entertaining.

He counts Mr Blair, Mr Cameron and former News Of The World editor Rebekah Brooks as close friends.His PR company Freud Communications advises Walkers Crisps, KFC, drinks company Diageo – and the Department of Health.

Mr Murdoch¿s supporters claim Mr Freud 'joined forces' with Ms Deng in his own battle with Mr Murdoch

The Murdoch-Freud dispute over Mr Blair comes amid an increasingly bitter rivalry between the  two men, linked to the battle to inherit the media empire of 82-year-old Mr Murdoch.

Mr Freud told The Mail on Sunday last night: ‘It would be very sad if these opinions apparently anonymously attributed to my father-in-law are accurate. He has certainly said nothing to me personally.

‘I will be eternally grateful to Rupert Murdoch for producing  Elisabeth, who is practically perfect in every way. Our views differ quite dramatically on a number of subjects professionally and I regret that this has caused my relationship with him to be sometimes conflicted.

‘But we have had good times as well as bad times, we both love his daughter and his grandchildren, if not always each other.

‘I do not believe anything else is terribly important.’
