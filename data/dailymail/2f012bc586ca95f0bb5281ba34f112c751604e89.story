Silvano Vinceti is conducting DNA test on a skeleton found in the Sant'Orsola convent near Florence

Italian art detectives are a step closer to identifying the lady behind Mona Lisa’s enigmatic smile.

DNA tests are underway on bones that may belong to a Florentine noblewoman, named Lisa Gherardini, who is widely believed to be the model for Leonardo da Vinci’s painting.

Historian Silvano Vinceti has taken samples from a skeleton in Sant’Orsola convent near Florence and is comparing them to DNA from the bones of some of Gherardini's confirmed relatives.

If a DNA match is made, Professor Vinceti will make a 3D reconstruction of Gherardini's face from the skull, as well as details in da Vinci’s Mona Lisa painting.

‘If we don’t find her, art historians can continue to speculate about who the model really was,’ Professor Vinceti told the Wall Street Journal.

The results from the analysis should be ready by May or June, he said.

The Florentine family tomb was opened up in August last year for the first time in centuries in a bid to identify the model in da Vinci's painting.

Lisa Gherardini is thought to have posed for the painting between 1503 and 1506.

Florentine noblewoman, Lisa Gherardini,  is widely believed to be the model for Leonardo da Vinci’s painting.

Lisa Gherardini is thought to have posed for the painting between 1503 and 1506.

Not much is knownown about Gherardini's life. Born in Florence and married in her teens to a cloth and silk merchant who later became a local official, she was mother to five children.

It
 is believed Francesco Del Giocondo commissioned the portrait to 
celebrate either his wife’s pregnancy or the purchase of a house around 
1502 and 1503.

After his death, Gherardini became a nun. She died in 1542 at the age of 63 and was said to be buried near the Sant’Orsola convent's altar.

Notes taken by a Florentine official confirm that da Vinci was working on a portrait of her at the time.

Even if she is identified as the model for Mona Lisa, there remain many mysteries surrounding the painting.

For instance, countless theories have circulated about Mona Lisa's cryptic smile.

Some have argued the painting is a self-portrait of the artist, or one of his favourite male lovers in disguise, the evidence they say is the fact Da Vinci kept it with him until his death in Amboise, France in 1519.

The most curious theories have been provided by medical experts turned Renaissance art sleuths.

One theory was that the Mona Lisa's mouth is clamped firmly shut because she was undergoing mercury treatment for syphilis which turned her teeth black.

An American dentist has claimed that the tight-lipped expression was typical of people who have lost their front teeth, while a Danish doctor was convinced she suffered from congenital palsy which affected the left side of her face and this is why her hands are overly large.

‘With the medical techniques that are available today we could rebuild her physique and recreate the famous pose,’ said Leonardo Da Vinci expert Professor Carlo Pedretti.
