Super Bowl Sunday is the nation's annual excuse to overload on football, friends and food.

So much so that the average American consumes an incredible 2,400 calories during the four to five hours of the NFL's climatic final.

That's equal to a slice of pizza, four cans of beer, one serving of BBQ wings, one serving of fried chicken, a portion of Nachos with, a slice of cheese cake, a milkshake and fries. 

Overall, it is estimated the US eats 1.25 billion chicken wings on the day of the game, enough to stretch from century link field in Seattle to the Gillette Stadium in Massachusetts 55 times

This is according to Atlanta-based Calorie Control Council, who made the estimate from a list of popular food items purchased for game day.

They then combined this with statistics from food industry groups, according to a report in ABC News.

And it's easy to see how these calories add up.

Eating just two slices of pepperoni pizza and drinking a few beers crosses the 1000 calorie threshold, according to calculations from the USDA nutrition database.

A previous study has found that America's favorite game day food is chips and dip - with 61 per cent of U.S. Super bowl fans reaching for the fried potato crisps come kick-off.

The week of the Super Bowl is also the week people spend the most at the supermarket - nearly $150

Antacid sales are expected to increase by 20 per cent on the Monday after the big game. And last year, statistics show that moments after the Seahawks won the game, toilet use spiked 13 per cent in New York

Overall, Poo-Pourri estimates the US eats one billion chicken wings over Superbowl weekend, 11 million slices of pizza on Sunday and 11 million pounds of potato chips. 

Antacid sales are expected to increase by 20 per cent on the Monday after the big game.

And last year, statistics show that moments after the Seahawks won the game, toilet use spiked 13 per cent in New York City. 

A separate study by Cornell University, tracked food spending habits for more than 200 households in New York over a period of seven months.  

They found that by far the average American consumes an incredible 6,000 calories of junk food during the week of the NFL's climatic final. 

The average calories for popular Super Bowl snacks. Onion rings can pack 400 calories, while a large bag of potato chips can have up to 1,200 calories

Eating just the two slices of pepperoni pizza and a few beers cross the 1000 calorie threshold, according to calculations from the USDA nutrition database

That's the largest number of calories US residents consume in any week through the year, beating both Thanksgiving and Christmas.

1 large 14 inch pizza

1 portions of Nachos with cheese

4 can of beer

1 portion of french fries

1 Milkshake

1 serving of BBQ wings

1 large bag of potato chips

1 bar of chocolate

1 serving of fried chicken

1 piece of cheesecake

1 serving of onion rings 

It's equal to consuming three 14-inch pizzas in one sitting, or eating six large bags of potato chips with dip.

They looked at the total of the calories per serving of every item purchased during the course of each week, to see if they were buy more foods that had more calories. 

The study discovered that the second worst week to splurge on food is the week before Super Bowl when people purchase closer to 5,500 calories per serving. 

They found the week of the Super Bowl is also the week people spend the most on average at the supermarket - nearly $150. 

'The higher number represents the fact that the household was buying foods that give more calories each time they eat a recommended serving,' Professor David Just, who led the study, told the Washington Post.

'This means people buy the highest calorie foods around the Super Bowl.' 

A previous study has found that America's favourite game day food is chips and dip - with 61 per cent of U.S. Super bowl fans reaching for the fried potato crisps come kick-off. Pictured is the New England Patriots QB Tom Brady ahead of the game on Sunday

A study, by Calorie Control Council, has put the calorie intake at around 2,400 during the game
