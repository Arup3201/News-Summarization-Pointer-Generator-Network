Stars such as Eliza Dusku, will.i.am and LL Cool J unveiled the latest technology at this year's Consumer Electronics Show at the Las Vegas Convention Centre.

The show is the biggest event in the year's technology calendar - attended by technology giants including Panasonic, Sony, Samsung and LG.

Tech companies were beating the drum for 3D with a little less enthusiasm than previous years - but instead, new ultra-slim OLED TVs and 'Ultra HD' sets offering four times the resolution of normal hi-def were on offer to tempt TV fans.

Ultra-slim OLED TVs on the Samsung stand - the televisions use a screen technology which has been too expensive for big flatscreen TVs until now, and only found in the tiny screens of smartphones such as Samsung's Galaxy S2

This year was Microsoft's last at the 
show, and the tech giant took the opportunity to show off devices 
running its new Windows 8 software.

Intel also made a splash with its ultrabooks - super-slim, long-lasting laptops designed to offer an alternative to tablets such as Apple's iPad. There were dozens of ultrabooks on show, some slilmmer than Apple's barely-there MacBook.

Apple, as ever, did not attend the show, but there were dozens of new Android handsets aimed squarely at its iPhone, including a Sony-branded handset that's the first fruit of the company's recent split with Ericsson.

The show wasn't entirely without a presence from Apple, though - 250 Apple employees were registered to attend, and a reporter spotted the company's head of iOS product marketing Greg Joswiak in the show's halls.
