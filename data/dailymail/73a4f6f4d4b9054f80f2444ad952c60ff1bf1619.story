Brendan Rodgers has said many British players fail at the top level because they are paid too much, too young in comparison to their peers from other countries.

The Liverpool manager, whose side take on Southampton in their opening Premier League game on Sunday, thinks being part of the most high-profile league in the world, combined with the premium placed on British players by agents and clubs, is distorting young players’ expectations and killing their hunger.

Rodgers made the points whilst discussing 19-year-old Raheem Sterling, insisting it is important the player is rewarded in a proportionate manner, to ensure he does not follow previous generations which have failed to develop after securing their first multi-million pound contract.

Huge talent: Raheem Sterling has been a revelation in the past year, for club and country

Asked about a potential new deal for Sterling, Rodgers said: ‘It will be something that’s done, but I think we need to be careful. Please don’t be putting too much on the British players and English players because they get rewarded and I think that’s partly what kills them in this country.

‘We’re very happy here with the way we deal with the young players — we reward them. Raheem is a kid who has propelled himself on to another level again. He got rewarded for that, and that will always be the case here with all the players.

‘But we just have to be careful because when you reward young players too quickly, you give them too much, too early, then that will be their downfall. There’s no doubt he’s at a real good level.

‘It’s a big problem with British players, a massive problem in this country and I see it with the British players in particular. Why? Because the reward is no longer there, they lose their hunger. Young players buy a new Range Rover Sport before they have even got their driving licence.

‘We have been able to keep him [Sterling] grounded. He’s a very wealthy young man as he stands at 19.

‘That wealth I am sure will continue over the next few years because of his talent, which is getting better all the time.’
