Britain faces four more days of Siberian weather – and the odds of a white Easter are dropping as quickly as the temperatures.

The freeze that struck Britain at the weekend will continue today, with most areas blighted by bad weather as the mercury falls as low as -7C.

Yesterday’s band of light sleet and snow falling from East Anglia to Lancashire is expected to become heavier today, with the whole of the south coast facing up to two inches of snow.

The Met Office issued an amber weather warning for Devon, where four inches were expected by this morning.

Icy weather has been swept in by high winds from Siberia, with forecasters predicting some of the coldest conditions of the winter. Snow will continue to fall well into this week, with rain replacing it on Friday.

Motoring services firm RAC said it expects potential breakdowns to increase by 20 per cent over the next few days, while the Highways Agency said it had more than 500 salt spreaders, ploughs and snow-blowers on standby to deal with ice on the roads this week.

The cold snap comes after a week of balmy weather that saw parts of Britain enjoy hotter temperatures than Ibiza.

Now bookmakers are slashing the odds of a
first white Easter since 2008, after swathes of the country were 
blanketed in snow yesterday.

It is even money for snow to fall in any 
major city over the holiday at the end of this month – and there’s a 4/1
chance of the coldest Easter on record, according to Ladbrokes.

Today will see temperature highs of just 5C and lows of -7C – just a few degrees above this winter’s low of -13.6C, recorded in January in Buntingford, Hertfordshire.

Julian Mayes of Meteogroup said: 
‘Overnight temperatures will have some quite severe and penetrating 
frosts, particularly on Tuesday and Wednesday nights right across the 
country.

‘Early Monday
morning, we’re looking at a risk of snow, particularly over south-west 
England, then central-southern England, and that then moving into 
south-east England.

‘Obviously, it being Monday morning, this could be quite disruptive for the rush-hour.’
