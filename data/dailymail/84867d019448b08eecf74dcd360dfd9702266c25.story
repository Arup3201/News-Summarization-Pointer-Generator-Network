She is the English rose who was born and bred in a tiny village in Devon but Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has been transformed into a glamorous Beverly Hills girl for her latest campaign.

The supermodel is Juicy Couture's new recruit and sports a curly perm, velour tracksuit and neon accessories in her latest photoshoot for the LA-based brand.

Photographed on the sun-drenched Venice beach by Inez and Vinoodh, Rosie and fellow clothes horse Emily DiDonato work reflective sunglasses, gold hoops and rainbow baseball caps - and even manage to make them look cool.

The 26-year-old, who resembles a 90210 star in the all-American shoot, has been a busy lady lately.

She strutted her stuff on the catwalk at Paris Fashion Week, has designed a SS14 lingerie range for M&S and has featured on a plethora of best dressed lists.

Rosie has also been holidaying on the Napali coast and keeping fans updated with various pouty selfies showcasing her toned physique.

In shape: Rosie's slim physique is thanks to following James Duigan's Clean & Lean diet

Rosie works with nutritionist-to-the-stars James Duigan, whose world famous Clean & 
Lean diet has picked up a host of celebrity fans such as Elle Macpherson,
 David Gandy and Hugh Grant.

Rosie met James several 
years ago and is such a fan that she penned the introduction to his book
 Clean & Lean: Flat Tummy Fast.

Said Rosie: 'James knows exactly how I want my body to look: lean, taut and strong, yet soft, curvy and feminine.

'What
 I've learnt through working with James is that by focussing on creating
 a healthy body you can really achieve all of these things, faster than I
 ever thought possible. Oh and by the way, nobody can get a stomach as 
flat as James can!'
