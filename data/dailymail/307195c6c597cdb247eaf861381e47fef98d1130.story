The Serious Fraud Office has lost thousands of pages of confidential evidence obtained during its high profile probe into defence giant BAE Systems.

In a major breach of data protocol, 32,000 pages of documents, 81 tapes and several computer files were wrongly sent to the wrong owner.

The extraordinary blunder relates to the huge investigation into a £43billion BAE deal to supply more than 100 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia and heaps pressure on Attorney General Dominic Grieve.

David Green, director of the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), ordered a wide-ranging review after the scale of the data blunder came to light

David Green, the director of the SFO, 
asked former Parliament’s former director of security Peter Mason to 
conduct an urgent review of the incident.

The inquiry ended in 2010 when a deal was reached in which BAE agreed plead guilty to a breach of accounting rules over allegations of bribery during arms and equipment sales.

Anyone who provides evidence to the SFO is able to ask to have it returned when a probe has been completed.

But at some point between May and October last year a vast cache of data – a total of three per cent of all the evidence gathered during the case – was wrongly sent to an unnamed individual or organisation.

But the error involving documents from 58 different courses only came to light in May this year, a year after it could have happened.

Emily Thornberry, Labour’s shadow attorney general, said: 'This is government incompetence of the first magnitude.

'The SFO has stumbled from shambles to shambles, with the Attorney General completely failing to get a grip.

'Incompetence like this threatens to have an impact on the reputation of the UK and its relations overseas.

'People
will be wondering how many other skeletons there are in the SFO 
cupboard that the Attorney General is aware of but is declining to make 
public. The Government needs to get a grip, get to the bottom of this 
mess and come clean about exactly what went wrong and how.'

The SFO stressed that no material 
which could endanger national security was included in the data loss and
the conviction in the case still stands.

A wide-ranging review of the way the 
SFO handles highly sensitive confidential information has been ordered 
to prevent a repeat of the mistake.

BAE Systems was investigated over allegations of corruption in relation to arms deals around the world

The Serious Fraud Office started its investigation into BAE in 2004.

The investigation, which was prompted by allegations received concerning a defence contract with Saudi Arabia, ultimately also included contracts between BAE and a number of other countries including the Czech Republic, Romania and South Africa.

The SFO investigation relating to Saudi Arabia was discontinued in December 2006 in the interest of national security.

BAE agreed a settlement in February 2010 with the US Department of Justice in relation to contracts with Saudi Arabia and central and eastern Europe, and with the SFO in relation to a Tanzania contract.

The FTSE 100 giant was fined £500,000 at Southwark Crown Court in December 2010 after admitting it had failed to keep adequate accounting records in relation to the defence contract for the supply of an air traffic control system to the government of Tanzania.

A
Serious Fraud Office spokesperson said: 'The SFO is dealing with an 
incident of accidental data loss. No material relating to national 
security was included in the data.

‘Any loss of data is a serious matter and the SFO has taken action to ensure no further material can be wrongly sent out.'

To date 98 per cent of the missing date has been retrieved, and the SFO thinks the rest may have been destroyed.

Mr Mason's review concluded that the data leak was accidental and not a deliberate attempt to share information with interested parties in the case.

He recommended designated staff being made responsible for the ongoing ownership of data in concluded cases, a re-drafting of the responsibilities of the SFO’s Senior Information Risk Owner and raising the profile of data handling as a key risk in the SFO’s work.

The spokesman added: ‘The SFO has a duty to return material to those who supplied it, upon request, after the close of an investigation. 

‘In this instance the party requesting the return was sent additional material which had in fact been obtained from other sources. 

‘The data constituted 3 per cent of the total data in the case.  It consists of 32,000 document pages, 81 audio tapes and electronic media.

‘Of this, 98 per cent of the material has been recovered and efforts continue to recover all the remaining material that has not already been destroyed by the recipient.’

BAE Systems, Europe's biggest defence company, was fined £250million by the United States and Britain in 2010, following long-running corruption investigations at home and abroad into defence deals in Saudi Arabia, Tanzania, Sweden, the Czech Republic and Hungary.

A spokesman for the Attorney General's office said: 'The Attorney General's office is aware of this incident and takes this issue extremely seriously. 

'We are working with the new management team at the Serious Fraud Office to ensure all possible steps are taken to ensure that this incident is not repeated.

'The Attorney General supports the package of measures taken by the Director of the SFO following this incident which will help improve the way that the organisation handles information in the future.'
