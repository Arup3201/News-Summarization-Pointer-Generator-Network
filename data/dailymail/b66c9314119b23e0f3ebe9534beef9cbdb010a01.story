A motorist escaped his exploding car unhurt despite bravely emptying his boot of butane gas canisters to avert an even worse catastrophe.

Instead of running for cover, Tomasz Morawski, 34, leapt from his burning vehicle, opened his boot and carried the explosive canisters to safety at the side of the road.

With help from a passing motorist, he guaranteed the safety of other drivers who recklessly continued to pass his burning car, and that of firefighters who arrived to extinguish the flames.

Spontaneous combustion: Tomasz Morawski, 34, leaps from his car after its engine burst into flames when he stopped at a red light on his way to work in the city of Gliwice, southern Poland

Bravery: As other motorists try to get their vehicles out of the way, Mr Morawski and another motorist empty his boot of butane and propane gas canisters to avert a possibly disastrous explosion

Busy: The video was shot from a CCTV camera during the morning rush hour in Gliwice

'I'm just glad I was able to get the gas canisters out in time otherwise this could have been a lot, lot worse,' Mr Morawski said.

CCTV footage shows Mr Morawski's vehicle quickly engulfed in flames after he stopped at a red light on the way to work in Gliwice, southern Poland.

As the fire quickly spreads, he jumps out of the driver side door, pops open the boot and begins emptying it of propane and butane gas canisters.

Fellow motorist Michal Bukowski, 29, was quoted by Central European News as saying: 'I was going in the opposite direction and was waiting for the lights to change when I saw the car suddenly go up in flames with a massive whoosh.

'It was like it had been hit with a rocket.

'The driver got out and I saw him running back and forth across the road taking canisters to the pavement.

'I quickly dialled the fire brigade and then pulled over to help.'

As black billowing smoke filled the sky the two men unloaded the car as a fire engine pulled up. Vehicles continued to drive past the fire until emergency services were able to block the road.

Emergency response: Firefighters douse the burning car as a vehicle arrives to block the road

Dangerous: Vehicles had continued to drive past until that point, even though the car could have exploded

Safety: Steam mixes with smoke to finally obscure the view of the CCTV camera over the junction as the fire is extinguished. Gliwice's fire brigade said it would examine the car to work out why it exploded

A spokesman for Gliwice's fire brigade said: 'We sealed off the road as at that point traffic was still going by and we had no idea if or when the engine would exploded.

'We then doused it with water ensuring the flames are well and truly out.

'We are now examine the car to try and identify the cause of the explosion.'

A major industrial and scientific hub, Gliwice is part of a wider metropolis of 2.7million in southern Poland called the Katowice urban area.
