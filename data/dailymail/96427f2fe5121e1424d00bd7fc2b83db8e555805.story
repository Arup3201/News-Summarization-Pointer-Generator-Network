Alaskans are demanding that Snoop Dogg keep his promise to perform in the state - known as the ‘last frontier’ - after voters choose to legalize pot last Tuesday.

The rapper and marijuana enthusiast made a promise back in September that he would perform a concert in Alaska if the state voted to legalize the recreational use of marijuana in the midterm elections.

‘If we get y'all to vote yes on Proposition 2, Snoop Dogg is coming to Alaska to do a concert, a wellness retreat concert, and I'm bringing some of that California with me to celebrate,’ said the hip hop star during an episode of his Double G News webcast.

On Tuesday, Alaskans voted to legalize marijuana and tax and regulate it just like alcohol and many celebrated by playing Snoop hits like Gin And Juice and Drop It Like It’s Hot.

Many also took to Twitter to remind the rapper about his promise.

'Will you be playing a show in #Fairbanks on your upcoming Alaska tour?' tweeted Weston Morrow.

'Sooooooo... bout that @SnoopDogg concert in Alaska?' asked MSL. 

User D-ice tweeted: 'Sounds like its concert time for @SnoopDogg in Alaska'.

On Wednesday morning the hip hop star even re-tweeted a Washington Post story about his promise, although he has yet to make any comment on if and when a show might take place.

He has a little time however as the new law will not take effect until 90 days after the election.

The initiative allows adults 21 years of age and older to possess up to one ounce of marijuana and grow limited amounts in private.

Marijuana will also be cultivated, tested, and sold by licensed, taxpaying businesses that require proof of age - instead of criminal enterprises in the underground market.

Alaska voters approved a ballot measure to end marijuana prohibition on Tuesday, capping off a historic election year for marijuana policy reform. 

Voters in Oregon also adopted a similar measure, making it the third state in the nation to end marijuana prohibition, following Colorado and Washington.

Measure 91 in Oregon and Ballot Measure 2 in Alaska make possession of marijuana legal for adults 21 years of age and older, and they establish systems in which marijuana is regulated and taxed similarly to alcohol. 

A less far-reaching proposal was voted in in the District of Columbia to allow marijuana possession but not retail sales.
