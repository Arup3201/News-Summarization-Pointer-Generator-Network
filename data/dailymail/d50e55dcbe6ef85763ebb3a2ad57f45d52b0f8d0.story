Nigel Pearson was involved in an extraordinary clash with Crystal Palace midfielder James McArthur in the dying minutes of the 1-0 home defeat.

The Leicester City manager was accidentally upended as Marc Albrighton and McArthur collided.

Pearson laughingly put his hands round McArthur’s throat then helped him to his feet but then refused to let go of his shirt.

‘He said something to me,’ revealed Pearson, who tried and failed to sign McArthur last summer.

‘I don't have to reveal anything do I. I think I'm more than capable of looking after myself.

‘Listen, I've got a lot of respect for lad, I think he's a good player.

'Clearly you know what happened in the summer with the possibility of him coming here.

‘I'm as disappointed as how he was with how things possibly panned.

‘But that's nothing to do with me or the player - it's the other football club which was involved in it who take absolute responsibility for anything that wasn't quite right.

‘And a certain manager who opened his trap when he should have kept his mouth shut. I have absolutely no problem today at all with the lad. I think he's a good player. He's a likeable lad, good for him.’

Furthermore, onSports Lobster, McArthur explained: 'Situation with me and Nigel Pearson is getting blown out of proportion.' 

Pearson has already been given a one-match ban and a £10,000 fine this season for telling a supporter to 'f*** off and die'.

During his side's 3-1 defeat to Liverpool at the King Power Stadium at the beginning of December, Pearson was filmed shouting at the fan before being charged by the Football Association.
