Whether she is serenading the Obamas on Inauguration Night or stomping across the stage on tour as her alter ego Sasha Fierce, Beyonce is a bona fide icon who thousands of women want to emulate.

As the world's biggest diva performing 92 sell-out shows on her Mrs Carter World Tour, she brings out the wow factor night after night.

And now, the 31-year-old has revealed how she achieves her on-stage sparkle.

Beyonce is a devotee of the Natura Bissé Diamond Dust Skin Perfection treatment.

Glow getter: Beyonce has revealed that she obtains her luminous glow by having the Natura Bissé Diamond Dust Skin Perfection treatment, an £85 magnetic therapy using real diamond dust (pictured right)

The £85 treatment uses so-called 'magnetic therapy to give what they say is an 'overall sense of well-being as well as perfect skin'.

Early magnetic therapy techniques inspired Natura Bissé to create the Diamond Magnetic treatment, which uses diamond dust, lavender, essential oils and properties of the ancient healing art of Magnetic Therapy, a pseudoscientific alternative medicine practice involving the use of static magnetic fields.

Therapists lather Beyonce with luminous mud and diamond dust, which they combine with the use of magnetic tools and massage.

This multi-sensorial experience is said to amplify energy, unload tension and fight the skin’s signs of ageing.

No wonder she's so fierce! The treatment is a magnetic body treatment that is said to leave her with an overall sense of well-being as well as perfect skin

Speaking about Natura Bissé's beauty range, which are used on the singer during the treatment, she said: 'My friends always give me the products because I’m so behind, but I use a really good moisturiser called Diamond Crème by Natura Bissé.

'It’s really light. I’ve given it [to my friends] a lot, I always turn my friends onto it.'

Janine Bradley, Spa Manager at The Spa at Stanley House in Lancashire, who offer the treatment in the UK, added: 'For a star body which radiates health and beauty, this treatment is perfect.

'The precious diamond dust brings a natural and long lasting radiance to your skin while deep muscle techniques help unload stress and tension giving you renewed energy.'
