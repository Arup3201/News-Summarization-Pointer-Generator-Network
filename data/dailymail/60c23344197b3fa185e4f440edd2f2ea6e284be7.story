A teenage boy has been caught posing as an OB/GYN doctor at a hospital, investigators said today.

Police were called on Tuesday after a patient alerted staff at St Mary's Medical Center in West Palm Beach, Florida, that a juvenile dressed in a lab coat was inside an exam room.

The 17-year-old boy was found in the OB/GYN office of the Florida medical center, which is not part of the main hospital but an outpatient clinic. 

The patient said he was wearing a lab coat that had St. Mary's logo and 'anesthesiology' stitched on the front.

The teen was carrying a stethoscope and a face mask and telling people that he was a doctor, according to the Sun-Sentinel.

According to an arrest report: 'St Mary's Medical Center staff inside the OB/GYN office were alerted by a patient that a young black male who appeared to be a child was dressed as a doctor.'

A security guard told police he'd seen the teen around the hospital for a month. Another said the teen entered secured areas of the hospital this week.

Surveillance footage around the hospital revealed the boy entering the hospital from a car in the parking lot which had a white coat in the back seat.

The teen told police he's been a doctor for years and to speak to his family for confirmation.

The boy's mother later told investigators that her son was suffering from an undisclosed condition and was under the care of a doctor but had not been taking his medicine.

Police in Florida and officials at St Mary's Medical Center have agreed not to charge the teen. 

The hospital said that the teenager did not have access to any patients or any care area.
