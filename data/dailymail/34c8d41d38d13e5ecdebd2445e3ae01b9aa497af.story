All Blacks captain Richie McCaw took centre stage at the home of the Chicago Blackhawks on Tuesday as he took part in a 'Shoot the Puck' challenge between intervals during their game against the Anaheim Ducks.

McCaw, who will lead his side out in their Test match against the United States at Soldier Field on Sunday, was one of four contestants participating in the challenge - and didn't look out of his place on the ice.

Wearing a personalised Blackhawks jersey McCaw looked more than comfortable taking shots from the centre of the ice, and wasn't far off from winning the prize money of nearly £350,000.

As well as McCaw other All Blacks in attendance included Julian Savea, Sam Whitelock, TJ Perenara, Victor Vito, Cory Jane, Dan Carter and Wyatt Crockett.

Unfortunately, the Seahawks were unable to produce a performance to remember for the All Blacks, as they fell to a narrow 1-0 defeat against the Anaheim Ducks.

Speaking after participating in the challenge McCaw said on the opportunity to play in Chicago: 'Chicago is a pretty cool town to sell out 60,000 tickets in, especially where they don't know much about rugby. It's pretty awesome.'
