Good wishes: Gary Goldsmith is the first relative of the Duchess of Cambridge to speak out

The Duchess of Cambridge's uncle Gary Goldsmith was the first member of her family to speak out today following news that she has gone into labour.

The controversial businessman took to Twitter to discuss the 'very very exciting' announcement just a few hours after Kate was admitted to St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, central London.

However, there was no sign of any other members of the Middleton family - even though the Duchess' mother Carole and sister Pippa were expected to be at her bedside when she gives birth.

Kate, 31, was driven from her home in Kensington Palace to the exclusive Lindo Wing of the hospital shortly before 6am today.

She
 is being accompanied in hospital by her husband William, who drove her 
to London from her family home in Berkshire on Friday afternoon.

This
 morning at 7.30am it was publicly announced that the Duchess was in labour, and 
Mr Goldsmith subsequently posted a message on his Twitter feed in which he subtly alluded to 
the news.

The 
48-year-old wrote: 'Woke up to Thunder this morning but not a drop of 
rain? Now it's blistering & supposedly the hottest day if the year 
oh & very very exciting'.

He was then met with a chorus of 
congratulations from his 1,710 online followers, and sent out thanks to 
many of those who had got in touch.

Joy: Gary Goldsmith, pictured on the day of the Royal wedding in 2011, has spoken of his happiness after his niece the Duchess of Cambridge went into labour

Mr
 Goldsmith, a self-made millionaire who is the brother of Carole 
Middleton, has courted controversy in the past after being caught 
apparently taking cocaine in a sting operation.

However,
 he insists he is close to his elder sister, and was a guest at William 
and Kate's wedding in Westminster Abbey in April 2011.

The
 Duchess is said to be exceptionally close to her parents, Carole and 
Michael, as well as Pippa and their brother James, both of whom took 
prominent roles in the wedding.

Carole
 and Pippa were said to be planning to joining Kate at St Mary's for the
 birth, but it is not currently clear where they are.

It has been suggested that the Duchess will return to her family home in Bucklebury after she has given birth.

She spent last week in the village with William and her close relatives before returning to London three days ago.

Residents of Bucklebury today told of their excitement at the birth of a future monarch with roots in the area.

The village has been strung with bunting, and pubs were preparing to open specially to mark the historic occasion.Â

The Middletons' home is being guarded by police in a sign that the Royal couple are expecting to stay there in the near future.

Kate's former piano teacher Daniel Nicholls said: 'It's fantastic news that she's in labour and it's fantastic news for Kate and William and their families.

'Bucklebury just remains Bucklebury - it's a sleepy little village. Kate, I think, is a normal straightforward person and it's great for the Royal Family she's on board.

'Once the baby is born, Bucklebury will take it in its stride that the future, future King or Queen of England will come from here.'
