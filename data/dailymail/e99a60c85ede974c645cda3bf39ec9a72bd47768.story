The victim of the acid attack at a house in Truro, Cornwall, has been named locally as married father-of-one Andreas Christopheros, 29 (pictured)

A 29-year-old man is fighting for his life in hospital after having acid thrown in his face when he opened the front door to his home.

The man, who has been named locally as Andreas Christopheros, suffered life-threatening facial injuries after being attacked at his home in Truro, Cornwall, by a man yesterday afternoon.

His wife is also thought to have suffered burns, although she was not targeted in the 'nasty attack' and was instead injured as a result of going to the aid of her husband. 

It is understood the corrosive substance was thrown in the former public schoolboy's face after he opened the door at about 4pm.  

Devon and Cornwall Police said the victim remains in a critical condition at Royal Cornwall Hospital (Treliske) and confirmed the incident is being treated as attempted murder. 

Officers were called to the home of Mr Christopheros, a businessman involved in event and property management, following reports that a chemical substance, believed to be acid, had been thrown in his face.

Police today said he was 'helpless' and described the attack as 'really rare'.

One neighbour, who did not want to be named, said Mr Christopheros was a father of one and described the incident as 'terribly cowardly'.

The neighbour: 'The first thing we saw was lots of police cars swarming round the area last night.

'Then we heard that it was Andreas, and that he had been hurt and taken to hospital.

'We didn't know much else until this morning, we are absolutely shocked that someone has attacked him with some acid. It's a terribly cowardly thing to do.

'We heard that Andreas' wife was injured in the attack too, we're not sure about their little girl.

'It must have been someone he knew, because he opened the door and let them in.

'I've only spoken to him a few times, usually about his motorbike, he does have quite a nice bike.

Mr Christopheros, a businessman in the event and property management industries, has previously been involved in organising Newquay's Run To The Sun event - an annual custom car and dance festival - and is thought to have worked on BBC Radio One Roadshows.

The privately-educated businessman, who attended King's College in Taunton, Somerset, before graduating from Plymouth University, also used to run a holiday park in Newquay.

Another neighbour, who also wished to remain anonymous, described him as 'such a nice guy'.

He said: 'I can't believe this has happened to Andreas.

'To me, they just seem like a regular couple in there, I can't imagine what they could have done to deserve this.

'They're both always so polite, and friendly, I've never heard a cross word come from either of them. I hope he is okay, and makes a quick recovery.'

Officers were carrying out thorough checks outside the man's property, including in the front garden

David Burchell, 83, who lives nearby, said: 'I was very surprised when I heard something like this had happened on our street.

'It's usually very quiet around here. We're still not entirely sure what happened, but as far as we are aware someone threw a chemical in someone's face, just down the road.

'Police came round to ask if we had seen anything at about 6pm last night, but they didn't tell us there had been an attack. We heard the rest on the radio this morning.

'I hope the chap involved is okay, our thoughts go out to his family.' 

Police are now keen to speak to the driver of a red Peugeot van seen in Carrine Road at the time of the incident.

Detective Inspector Sharon Donald, who is leading the investigation, described the incident as a 'nasty attack' at a press conference this afternoon.

She said: 'It is an incident that we are treating with the utmost seriousness. It’s a nasty attack on a helpless male at his home address.

Police officers could be seen combing objects outside the man's property for any signs of clues or evidence

Police said the suspect was an 'unknown man' and said officers were working to trace witnesses

'If you are the driver of the red Peugeot van seen in the area, please get in touch with police so we can eliminate you from our enquiries.'

Officers have been carrying out house-to-house inquiries, handing out leaflets and patrolling the area to reassure residents.

Detective inspector Donald added: 'This is a really rare incident for Truro and we would like to reassure the public that this is being dealt with the utmost of seriousness to catch and convict the people or persons that have done this.

'We do not want the public to be alarmed by this isolated incident.'
