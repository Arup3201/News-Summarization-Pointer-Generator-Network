Leicester City are interested in staging a late bid for Tottenham midfielder Aaron Lennon.

The 27-year-old was set for a move to relegation rivals Hull City but the winger is believed to have expressed reluctance after they slumped to a 3-0 defeat by Newcastle at the weekend.

There has also been a dispute between Spurs and Hull over who would pay the majority of his £55,000-per-week wages until the end of the season when Lennon would make a permanent switch to Humberside.

Stoke are another team in the running to seal a move for Lennon after they were offered his services by Spurs, although there is also a snag over his wages.

However, Leicester boss Nigel Pearson is hoping to win the race as he looks to add some experience to his side as they try to avoid the drop from the Premier League. 

The Foxes are currently rooted to the bottom of the table, two points behind fellow relegation battlers QPR and Hull and a further point adrift of Burnley. 

Pearson has a good crop of wide-men in his squad but believes Lennon's know-how can help them during the run-in and is willing to make a loan bid. 

The right winger has the sort of raw pace and directness to threaten most Premier League defences 

Lennon, who has spent the last decade at Tottenham, last appeared for Mauricio Pochettino's men in their 1-0 Europa League loss to Besiktas back in December.

The 21-cap England international has made just three Premier League starts this term with boss Pochettino's style not favouring a pacy wide man.

Riyad Mahrez, who operates in the same position, will be back for Leicester’s key clash with Crystal Palace following Algeria’s exit from the Africa Cup of Nations.
