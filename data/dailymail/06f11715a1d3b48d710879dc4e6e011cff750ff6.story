A New York man accused of hurling homophobic slurs at a gay man on the street before shooting him dead laughed and boasted about the alleged murder to police as he was being handcuffed just minutes afterwards, according to prosecutors.

Elliot Morales, 33, has been charged with second-degree murder as a hate crime, menacing and two counts of possession of a weapon in the shooting death of Mark Carson, 32, just after midnight on Saturday.

The Greenwich Village resident rolled around 'laughing on the ground' and proudly told officers 'yeah, I shot him in the head' as he was arrested five blocks away from where Carson was killed, the Manhattan Criminal Court heard on Sunday.

Police said Morales used a silver Taurus .38-caliber revolver to shoot Carson at point-blank range as he walked with his 33-year-old companion on Sixth Avenue near West Eighth Street.

Morales was ordered held without bail pending another court appearance on Thursday. His attorney, Reginald Sharpe, could not be reached for comment.

On Saturday, minutes before opening fire in the lively Village streets, police say Morales followed Carson and his companion and asked them 'Are you afraid? Do you watch the news? Do you know what happened in Sandy Hook?' according to the New York Post.

He then asked Carson, 'Do you want to die here,' Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said.

Police said Morales called Carson a 'f*****' and a 'queer' before shooting him in the cheek in a neighborhood long known as a bedrock of the gay rights movement.

Morales was soon arrested a few blocks away.

He has six previous arrests including
one for attempted murder in 1998, police said. Details of that arrest 
weren't immediately clear. He served nine years in city and state 
prisons, The Post reported.

Saturday's shooting scene is a few 
blocks from the Stonewall Inn, the site of 1969 riots that helped give 
rise to gay rights when patrons reacted to police harassment.

The violence follows a spate of 
recent bias attacks on gay men in New York, but this was the first 
deadly one. Kelly said police were looking into possible links between 
the incidents.

The shooting stunned a city where, in
many neighborhoods, same-sex couples now walk freely holding hands. It 
also comes at a time when the gay marriage movement is gaining momentum 
in many parts of the United States. Twelve states have legalized 
same-sex marriage, including New York in 2011.

Carson was revealed on Sunday as a 
'courageous' gay man who never hid his sexuality - despite being 
subjected to anti-gay slurs for years. Before the gay-bashing assailant 
killed the 32-year-old, he asked whether his companion was his 
boyfriend. Carson didn't hesitate and told the man yes, according to 
reports.

Carson and his best friend of 15 years turned to walk away, but Morales followed them, the New York Post reported. After asking him if he wanted to die there, Morales demanded to know: 'Is he your boy?'

When Carson responded 'Yes,' Morales allegedly pulled out the pistol and shot Carson once at point-blank range. He was taken to Beth Israel Hospital, where he died.

'He was a courageous person,' Michael Bumpars, Carson's brother, told the New York Daily News.

'My brother was a beautiful person... He was our foundation.'

Police on Saturday said the attack was motivated by hate.

'This clearly looks to be a hate crime,' Kelly said.

Kelly says the gunman was seen urinating on the street outside a bar.

He
says the man went into the bar, made anti-gay remarks to the bartender 
and showed the bartender that he was wearing a holster with a silver 
pistol.

Kelly says the gunman then confronted the victim and a companion on the street and asked if they were 'gay wrestlers.'

'There
was no words that would aggravate the situation spoken by the victims 
here. They were confronted,' Kelly said. 'They did not know the 
perpetrators, no previous relationship.'

Carson lived in Brooklyn and managed a frozen yogurt shop in the West Village. He and his partner were going out for the night in Greenwich Village - a popular area for straight and gay revelers alike.

After the shooting, the gunman ran five blocks before cops captured him at West Third Street and MacDougal Street, on the edge of the NYU campus.

The busy and well-traveled intersection of 8th Street, Sixth Avenue and Greenwich Avenue is just a few blocks from Washington Square Park.

The shooter was crazed and confessed the shooting to cops when he was collared. Detectives are testing his blood to determine he was on drugs at the time.

Another two men who were with Morales when he first confronted Carson were questioned by police and released.

Openly gay New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn announced that the incident is being investigated as a hate crime.

'I am horrified to learn that last night, a gay man was murdered in my district after being chased out of a Greenwich Village restaurant and assailed by homophobic slurs,' she said in a statement.

West Village: A normally peaceful and progressive part of Manhattan.This is the fourth hate crime incident in two weeks in the city

'I stand with all New Yorkers in condemning this attack.'

This is the fourth such hate crime that targeted a gay man in the last two weeks in Manhattan.

'There was a time in New York City when hate crimes were a common occurrence,' she added.

'There was a time in New York City when two people of the same gender could not walk down the street arm-in-arm without fear of violence and harassment. We refuse to go back to that time.

This kind of shocking and senseless violence, so deeply rooted in hate, has no place in a City whose greatest strength will always be its diversity.'

On May 10, police said a gay couple was attacked on West 32nd Street and beaten so severely that one of the men needed eye surgery.

Days earlier, another gay couple was assaulted by a group of men in the same area near Madison Square Garden.
