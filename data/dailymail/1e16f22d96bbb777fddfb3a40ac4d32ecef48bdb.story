Motorists are likely to get an early Christmas present with petrol prices set to drop to a four-year low this festive season.

The average price for a litre of fuel will fall to £1.20 next month - 10p cheaper than this time last year - experts have predicted.

Prices could be lower still, around £1.15, at supermarket such as Asda and Tesco.

RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams told The Sun: 'If oil continues to be pumped way above global demand and the Pound remains strong against the dollar, we should have the chest forecourt prices since early December 2010.'

At £1.20 a litre, filling the tank of an average-sized family car would cost motorists £6 less. Filling up with diesel, expected to sell for £1.24 a litre, would cost £8 less. 

A spokesman for comparison website Petrolprices.com said it wasn't 'beyond the realms of possibility' that petrol would fall below the £1 mark.

Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, last week urged petrol companies to pass on savings 'as quickly as possible'.

He said: ‘When the price of oil falls, the public have a right to expect pump prices to fall like a stone, not a feather’.

But petrol prices can only fall so far as tax accounts for 58p of the per-litre price and VAT is around 20p.  

Brian Madderson, of the Petrol Retailers’ Association, said earlier this month that it had tried for weeks to discuss the issue with the Treasury adding that ‘to criticise the industry without speaking to us is grossly unfair’.

Luke Bosdet of the AA said while supermarkets were leading the price cuts, ‘fuel prices … are not moving fast enough’.

Stephen Glaister, of the RAC Foundation, said Mr Alexander was ‘passing the buck’ and the Government was ‘the biggest driver of pump prices’.
