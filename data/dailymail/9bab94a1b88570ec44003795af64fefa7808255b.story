An electric change of pace propelled odds-on favourite Tryster to a three-quarter length success in the feature Coral Easter Classic as his Godolphin stable dominated £1.1million All Weather Finals day at Lingfield.

The four-year-old, ridden by William Buick, beat Complicit to complete a 22-1 treble for his trainer Charlie Appleby.

He had earlier been successful with Pretend (Buick) in the Unibet Sprint Championship Stakes and Four Seasons (Adam Kirby) in the 32Red Three-Year-old Mile Championship.
