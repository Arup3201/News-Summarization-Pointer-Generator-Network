Busted: Christie Dawn Harris, 28, was hiding a loaded gun in her genitalia and bags of crystal meth in her buttock cheeks

A 28-year-old Oklahoma woman who was discovered in March with a loaded handgun wedged inside her vagina during a drug arrest has been sentenced to 25 years in prison.

On June 27, Christie Dawn Harris pleaded no contest to three felony counts of possession of methamphetamines with intent to distribute, gun possession and bringing contraband into jail.

Judge Steven Kessinger sentenced Harris to 25 years on each count, with the three prison terms to run concurrently. Harris also has to pay $1,363 in court costs and fees, The Smoking Gun reported.

Harris' legal troubles started just before 4am on March 4, when police officers spotted her and another woman inside a Toyota Yaris parked in the 100 block of North Bluff in Ada, Oklahoma.

Harris was taken into custody after the officers searched her vehicle and discovered meth, drug paraphernalia, a Raven Arms .25 caliber semi-automatic pistol and a magazine.  

As she was taken to jail, the 28-year-old complained to arresting officers that she needed to go to the bathroom.

When she was told that she had to change into 'jail clothing' and submit to a cavity search, Harris took off her shirt, pants and socks, but refused to remove her underwear, claiming she was on her period.

She eventually agreed to submit to a 
body cavity search, at which point Officer Kathy Unbewust said she 
'observed at that time a wooden and metal item sticking out from her vagina area.'

It turned out to be a loaded Freedom Arms .22-caliber handgun, with three live bullets and one spent shell.

But
 the revelations didn't stop there. According to Pontotoc County 
District Attorney Chris Ross, 'as [Harris] turned around, [the officer] 
noticed more plastic baggies, larger plastic baggies wedged in the crack of her buttocks.'

The bags were found to contain meth.

Harris and an accomplice were booked on various drugs and weapons charges. They both have extensive criminal records.
