Six members of a suspected drugs ring were arrested today after officers seized smuggled heroin - stashed inside books.

Five men and a woman were arrested in a string of dawn raids at around 7am following an international investigation to track the illegal drugs.

Detectives from the National Crime Agency seized around 95kg of the class A drug when they stormed properties across the UK.

Stash: Officers found the class A drug concealed in books, suitcases with false bottoms and specially adapted clothing. Officers from the National Crime Agency arrested six suspected members of an organised crime group responsible for trafficking large quantities of heroin into the United Kingdom and other European countries

Officers found the class-A drugs - with an estimated street value of around £5 million - stashed inside books, suitcases with false bottoms and bags of the drug sewn into the lining of specially-adapted clothing.

It is thought the gang employed couriers to bring the concealed drugs into the UK on flights from Pakistan.

Two 52-year-old men and a 37-year-old woman were arrested in Stourbridge, West Midlands, on suspicion of being involved in the importation of heroin.

A 42-year-old Bradford man and two Birmingham men aged 32 and 41 were also arrested in the operation, which was aided by West Midlands Police, the Spanish Guardia Civil and other international law enforcement agencies.

Concealed: Heroin was hidden in false bottoms of suitcases. Officers say the drugs found have an estimated street value of £5million

Clothing: The bags of drugs were smuggled in clothing with specially-adapted pockets

Haul: 95kg of the drug was seized by detectives in a series of dawn raids across the country

All six suspects were being interviewed yesterday at police stations in Birmingham while investigations continued.

Richard Warner, of the NCA, said: 'These arrests are a major success for the NCA and its partners. Tackling the supply of drugs on a global level is a priority for the agency.

'We believe this organised crime group is responsible for importing large quantities of heroin - bringing misery, harm and violence to communities in Birmingham and other cities.

'The NCA’s national remit and effective partnerships, which cross national and international boundaries, mean we have the capability to pursue criminals relentlessly wherever they are in the world.'

Officers found the class-A drugs - with an estimated street value of around £5 million - stashed inside books, suitcases with false bottoms and bags of the drug sewn into the lining of specially-adapted clothing.
