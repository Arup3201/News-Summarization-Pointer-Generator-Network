Sienna Miller today admitted having a 'brief' affair with Daniel Craig - but insisted that she was just being friendly when she left him a voicemail message saying 'I love you'.

The News of the World claimed that the actress was cheating on her then-boyfriend Jude Law in 2005 after a reporter listened to the message by hacking in to Mr Craig's inbox.

The actress told a court today that she had a 'brief encounter' with her friend and co-star Mr Craig, but added that she often said 'I love you' at the end of phone conversations with friends or family.

Speaking via video-link at the Old Bailey, Ms Miller was asked about a message she left on Mr Craig's phone saying: 'Hi. It's me. Can't speak. I'm at the Groucho with Jude. I love you.'

Affair: A hacked message apparently revealed that Sienna Miller was in a relationship with Daniel Craig, her co-star in 2004 film Layer Cake

Co-stars: Ms Miller today admitted the pair were 'briefly involved' (the two pictured in film Layer Cake above) as she gave evidence to the Old Bailey

She said: 'The thing that's been 
slightly misconstrued about this voicemail message is the fact that I 
said "I love you" and that this was some incredibly important 
declaration of love. I've always ended my phone calls to Daniel saying 
"I love you".'

Ms Miller gave evidence from New Orleans, and could be seen sitting next to an FBI agent as she was questioned.

Former
 News of the World reporter Dan Evans has previously told the court that
 a story about Ms Miller and Mr Craig having an affair was partially 
sourced from the voicemail message.

Ms
 Miller denied the message meant she was in a relationship with Mr Craig
 but she did tell the court they were 'briefly involved'.

'Whether or not I was in a relationship with Daniel Craig, it was not a relationship, it was a very brief encounter, and he was my best friend,' she said.

'Me saying I love you, whether anything romantic happened briefly or not, there was nothing significant.'

Ms
 Miller also confirmed she left messages on the phone of Kelly Hoppen, 
her former stepmother, but denied she was weeping during the phone 
calls.

The court heard that Evans claimed to hear Ms Miller crying in a message to Ms Hoppen.

Ms
 Miller said: 'It's a difficult time to remember. It was very 
emotionally raw. It is not possible for me to say whether or not with 
any certainty. I think I was crying a lot at the time.

'But I do not think I would have been crying in a message to Kelly Hoppen, no.'

When
 asked about her relationship with the media by Timothy Langdale QC, for
 former editor Andy Coulson, she said: 'It was part of my job to 
communicate with the media and, yes, I had some negative experiences.'

Coulson is on trial charged with 
conspiring to hack phones and conspiring to commit misconduct in a 
public office, alongside former Sun and NotW editor Rebekah Brooks and 
five others.

All seven defendants deny all the charges against them.

The
 Layer Cake star said she had pleaded with a News of the World 
journalist to be kinder to Mr Law when they met at a pre-Baftas party, 
asking him to 'give Jude a break'.

She said: 'I spoke to him as a human being, making clear that this was an off-the-record conversation.

Earlier the court heard that a source 
connected to Mr Law had asked the News of the World to write that Ms 
Miller had 'cheated first', adding that the actress was 'clingy' and a 
bit of a 'stalker'.

A News of the World journalist is alleged to have met with Mr Law’s publicist to discuss how the tabloid would report the affair.

The PR asked the journalist to ‘back-date’ the affair so it would appear Miss Miller cheated on Law before he was caught out in a fling with his children’s nanny.

They allegedly said the request came from Mr Law himself.

According to a transcript of their taped conversation, she said: ‘If you could definitely pre-date it so that she cheated first, that’s the thing he wants the most.’

The Oscar-nominated actor was then said to have given his approval to a headline saying he had broken off their relationship over the affair.

'This
 was a conversation between two human beings, not an actress and a 
journalist. I appealed to his better nature and this was then abused.

'I probably said, "He's one of the nicest, kindest people I know and you are misrepresenting him, please stop it."'

When
 asked if she had ever courted publicity, she said: 'Absolutely never, 
not once. Never ever. Hand on my heart, I've taken an oath.'

Ms
 Miller said she was not aware that anyone associated with her or her 
then boyfriend Mr Law was communicating with the paper in 2005.

There
 was laughter in the court when Ms Miller was questioned by defence 
lawyer Mr Langdale about her message to Mr Craig which ended 'I love 
you'.

She said: 'You just told me you love me and I interrupted you.'

There
 was also laughter as the actress struggled to remember the date of her 
sister Savannah's wedding. She joked: 'This is a terrible test.'

Thanking
 her for giving evidence, judge Mr Justice Saunders told her: 'I am very
 sorry what has gone on in this court and reported in the press has 
caused you distress. We have tried to limit what has been said in 
court.'

Earlier the court heard that a source connected to Mr Law had asked the News of the World to write that Ms Miller had 'cheated first', adding that the actress was 'clingy' and a bit of a 'stalker'.

The actress called both Mr Law and Mr Craig several times a day, the source said in emails which were read out to jurors.

The trial continues.
