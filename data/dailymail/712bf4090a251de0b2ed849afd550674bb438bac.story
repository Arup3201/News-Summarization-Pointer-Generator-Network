When her mobile phone was stolen, Nikki Sweetman thought she would never see it again.

That was until she logged on to the internet and saw someone had been taking selfies – using her handset.

The poser, a pouting brunette who bears an uncanny resemblance to the victim, had apparently not realised the phone was programmed to automatically upload photos to Miss Sweetman's online account.

After sharing the pictures with her friends – along with a request to 'find this tramp' – Miss Sweetman has managed to track the woman down and pass her name to police.

After Nikki Sweetman's handbag, containing her iPhone 5c, was stolen, selfies of this woman appeared in the 23-year-old's iCloud photo stream

Last night, officers were still investigating the theft, which happened while the 23-year-old recruitment consultant was on her way home from a drunken work Christmas party two weeks ago.

After accidentally getting into an unlicensed taxi, she promptly fell asleep. When she woke, her handbag – containing her house keys, driving licence and iPhone 5c – was missing.

The taxi driver insisted Miss Sweetman did not have the bag with her when she got into the cab in Stratford, East London. But she reported the theft to police the following day.

A week later, on Boxing Day, she noticed new photos appearing in her iCloud account of a striking brown-haired woman. Incensed, Miss Sweetman posted them on Facebook with a message asking her followers to help her 'find this tramp'.

The photos have since been shared by nearly 35,000 people across the globe.

Miss Sweetman, from Dagenham in Essex, said: 'I was with friends when we saw loads of selfies of this woman coming through.

'I thought 'what the hell?' At first, we laughed and thought it was quite funny. She posted loads of photos of her earrings, which we thought must have been a Christmas present. But then I thought 'she shouldn't get away with this'. 'I'm quite angry that I'm now left with an iPhone 4, while she has my lovely iPhone 5c.

'I decided to share it on Facebook and have had hundreds of responses – including from Texas.

'Then someone who knew the woman in the photos got in touch and told me who she was.'

Miss Sweetman said she tracked down the woman's Facebook profile, which showed she was a Latvian national living in London who previously worked as a hotel barmaid.

Using a feature on the social networking site, she found out the selfies were taken at the Westfield shopping centre in Stratford.

Miss Sweetman, whose phone was worth around £500 when she took out the contract eight months ago, added: 'She now knows I'm trying to track her down and she's taken the selfies off Facebook and changed the settings so you can no longer see her location.' 

Implying the woman might be planning to flee the country, she added: 'I saw friends on her Facebook (page) had posted 'I hope you have your passport' after I shared her photo.' 

Miss Sweetman said the incident had left her worried about travelling alone. 'I'm now wary and check a taxi is licensed before getting in,' she added.

'The whole thing has made me realise that you shouldn't travel alone or with so many goods on you. It could have been a lot worse.'

A Metropolitan Police spokesman confirmed they were investigating, but said no one had been arrested.
