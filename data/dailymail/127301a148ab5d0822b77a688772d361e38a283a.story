These savoury dishes might look like they would be suited to being served up at the dinner table - but they are actually made entirely from CAKE.

From burger and chips to a jacket potato and baked beans, talented baker Nikki Dixon has created them all from the humble Victoria sponge - and some clever icing.

The incredibly realistic cakes are served in the same manner as the dishes they copy, with the burger being garnished with shortbread chips - and even served with a 'ketchup' dip - made from raspberry jam.

Full English anyone? Unbelievably this fry up, including bacon, toast, baked beans a potato cake and fried egg is made entirely of Victoria Sponge cake and carefully crafted icing

What at first glance appears to be a sandwich baked on soft white bread, dripping with mayonniase, is actually a vanilla sponge filled with cream.

Baker Nikki, from Southampton, has now turned her passion for food fixing into a business - and is inundated with orders for her unusual desserts after opening FoodieCakes in December last year.

Nikki, 22, said: 'I started making novelty cakes after I decided to bake my boyfriend, John, a birthday meal.

'He loves burgers, but I wanted to make something a bit special - so I decided to make him a burger birthday cake.

'He loved it, and posted a picture of it on Facebook - but before long there were more comments about the cake than there were people wishing him happy birthday.

'People were begging me to make them a food cake too, and before long, I was spending most of my time baking novelty cakes.

'I love coming up with new ideas and new challenges.

'I've just perfected a jacket potato and baked beans cake, which was very fiddly, but it looked great - and the customer was thrilled with it.

'I started my own business about six months ago and I've been inundated with orders ever since.

'I'll make whatever anyone asks for - some are easier than others, but cakes and icing are pretty versatile.

'I've
started making mini-bagels and little sandwiches too, which are really 
popular with corporate customers - I guess they make a talking point in 
the board room!'
