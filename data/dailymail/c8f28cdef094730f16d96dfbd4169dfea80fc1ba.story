Officers Ranell Roy and Ariel Ronell of the Rosenberg, Texas Police Department wanted to show the world that even though they wear a uniform they are just goofballs like everyone else.

After the cops posted the video of them lip syncing to Katy Perry'sÂ  Dark Horse on the Rosenberg Police Department Facebook Page, their video became an instant viral hit.

The Facebook posting has more than 4.5 million views, almost 50,000 likes and almost 200,000 shares. The video which was later posted to YouTube has over 60,000 views.

Pop star Katy Perry is the voice behind the song Dark Horse which she sings with rapper Juicy J.

To make things even more entertaining, Ranell Roy sang the female Katy Perry part of the song even though he is male and Ariel sang the male rapper Juicy J.'s part.

'We actually want to be able to show people that we're just people, just like everybody else,' said Ronell to KPRC.

'The message is that we're not the enemy, we're the friends of the community,' said Roy.

The posting was widely well received but a few Facebook users were critical of the officers' fun.

Some accused cops of wasting 'tax dollars' or 'slacking off on the job.'

'You waste tax money. And when calls "come in" you kill peoples dogs. You are cowards. useless and worthless,' wrote Eric Olsen.

Members of the community like Shawn cobb rushed to the cops' defense however and said, 'Awesome guys, thanks for showing the human side of our profession! We are our own rock stars in our patrol cars when calls are not coming in! Lol stay safe!'

'Thanks to the Rosenberg Police Department for their service to their community... and to the good service they do for all Police Officers everywhere. Changing perspective, one post at a time,' said the page for the UW-Platteville Police.
