The streets of Ferguson, Missouri, were almost deserted on Thanksgiving as the town enjoyed a well-deserved reprieve from the protests and riots of the past three days.

While Walmart stores across the country enjoyed one of their busiest days of the year, the branch on W. Florissant Ave - less than three miles away from the spot where Officer Darren Wilson shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown in August - remained closed all day.

Other major stores in the town including Target and Kmart were open for post-Thanksgiving shopping but were expected to close earlier than on a normal Thanksgiving because of the recent protests.

National Guard troopers keep vigil in front of a Walmart in Ferguson, Missouri, on Thanksgiving as the town enjoyed a peaceful day

Outside the Ferguson police station, the epicenter of much of the violence in recent days, the presence of police and members of the Missouri National Guard was kept to a minimum during the day.

On the same downtown street, beneath a lighted ‘Season's Greetings’ garland, three children used paintbrushes to decorate the plywood covering many storefront windows that was put up to foil potential vandals. 

One quoted from The Lorax by Dr. Seuss: ‘Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better, it's not.’

‘We thought we'd do what we could to make it a little more attractive and then try to bring the kids into it and get them involved in making the businesses appear a little less scary, depressing,’ said Leah Bailey, as her 7-year-old son Dennis climbed a ladder to finish an orange dragon.

Michael Brown Senior posted a photo on social media of his family sitting down to Thanksgiving dinner with an empty chair to represent their murdered son

With the Ferguson Walmart closed all day, some protesters decided to visit the next nearest branch in Maplewood and so found about 45 police officers in the store to ward of trouble

Michael Brown's father posted a photo on social media of his family sitting down to Thanksgiving dinner with an empty chair to represent their murdered son.

In solidarity, activists took to social media to encourage other people to post photographs of empty seats using the Twitter hashtag #StolenLives.

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, who declared a state of emergency before the grand jury decision, spend part of his Thanksgiving visiting some of the 2,200 National Guard troops deployed to the Ferguson area to quell violence. 

Nixon tweeted a photo of himself sitting down for a holiday meal with some of them.

'Having Thanksgiving dinner with citizen soldiers spending the holiday away from their families,' he wrote.

Since the grand jury's decision, protests have taken place across the country. Most have been peaceful.

But at least 130 demonstrators who refused to disperse during a Los Angeles protest were arrested Wednesday night, while 35 people were detained in Oakland following a march that deteriorated into unrest and vandalism, according to police officials. 

Back in Ferguson, Greater St. Mark Family Church sits blocks from where several stores went up in flames after the grand jury announcement. 

A handful of people listened to the Rev. Tommie Pierson preach on Thursday that the destruction and chaos was by ‘a small group of out-of-control people out there.’

‘They don't represent the community, they don't represent the mood nor the feelings of the community,’ Pierson said. ‘I would imagine if you talked to them, they probably don't even live here. So, we don't want to be defined by what they did.’

In downtown St. Louis, a group gathered near Busch Stadium for what organizer Paul Byrd called a ‘pro-community’ car rally meant to be peaceful and counter the recent Ferguson violence he suggested has tarnished the region's image.

Byrd, a 45-year-old construction worker from Imperial, Missouri, declined to say whether he supported Wilson but noted, ‘I totally support police officers.’ The cruise was escorted by a city police vehicle; no protesters showed up.

At least some protesters are expected to take to the streets on Thursday night as organizers have promised that demonstrators will return night after night as they have done since  Michael Brown was killed in August.
