Beaten: Her daughter said Mrs Carlyle was stabbed with a screwdriver every time she spoke

A British grandmother living in South Africa was stabbed, beaten and left in her car boot for ten hours after being kidnapped.

Dorothy Carlyle's car was hijacked in Durban on Tuesday and she was driven around while tied up and forced to make cash withdrawals from ATM machines.

Originally from Londonderry, the 59-year mother-of-three was only freed after a police gun battle and is now recovering from her wounds in hospital.

The terrifying ordeal began when she 
was attacked by three men with knives as she got into her silver BMW car
on her driveway at her home.

Her daughters  Lauren and Brooke told South African news website Independent Online their mother had left the house after lunch at 2:30pm  to go to her job as a Durban estate agent.

She had moved to the South Africa after leaving Ireland thirty years ago.

They recalled hearing a scream, but thought it was the children next door and then left the home to buy her a birthday present.

They
only raised the alarm when their mother failed to arrive home at 5:30pm
and her office confirmed she had not attended work.

Lauren alerted the police, but claimed her report was not taken seriously and a friend of the family hired a private detective.

They also alerted her son Mark who flew over from London to join the search.

Her brother-in-law Paul Carlyle, told the Londonderry Sentinel Mrs Carlyle was stabbed with a screwdriver every time she tried to speak.

He said the only reason she was kept her alive because the kidnappers were waiting to force her to withdraw more money yesterday. 

'Every time she spoke they stabbed her with a screwdriver,' said Mr Carlyle whose late brother was married to Mrs Carlyle but died in 2006.

Her daughter Lauren said her mother was shown off 'like a trophy' as passengers got in and out of the car.

'They slapped her if she spoke,' Lauren said.

She said that at one point she asked a young boy for water who was in the car and he asked his mother who refused. 

She believed they were arguing about who was going to kill her,' Lauren said.

Ms Carlyle was eventually found ten hours later outside a tavern in KwaMashu.

She had managed to activate a satellite vehicle tracking device in the car.

After a shoot-out with the hijackers, police arrested two women and a man while continuing the search for two more men.

No-one was hurt in the gun fight and bottles of alcohol were found at the scene.

All five people arrested, aged between 15 and 22, will appear in the Durban Magistrate's Court tomorrow.
