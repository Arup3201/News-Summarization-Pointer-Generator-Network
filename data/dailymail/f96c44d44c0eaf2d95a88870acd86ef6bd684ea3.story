Corporal Eric Rowden mingled with the Germans during the 1914 Christmas truce, exchanging buttons with one enemy soldier

When Corporal Eric Rowden heard the enemy shouting ‘Happy Xmas’ late on Christmas Eve, he was understandably apprehensive.

But to his astonishment, as the mist lifted over the top of the trenches on December 25, 1914, he saw German soldiers walking about and waving.

After a morning of playing football with his colleagues in the 16th Battalion of the London Regiment, the young soldier mingled with the Germans and exchanged buttons with a man he had been trying to kill the previous day.

Now the rare uniform button has gone on display in the Imperial War Museum as part of the First World War Galleries collection. The poignant scenes were described in a memoir given to the London museum, along with the button, by Cpl Rowden’s family.

The button spent the war pinned to an English postcard on which the German soldier, Werner Keil, had written his name.

Cpl Rowden, who was 20 on the day of the Christmas truce in 1914, wrote in a memoir: ‘They were calling in broken English and French, “comrade, Happy Xmas”, and all that and saying they wanted peace on Xmas day.

‘We kept a sharp lookout all night but nothing happened. But next day after it was light and the mist had lifted, we saw them walking about on the top of the trenches and waving to us, so it was not long before we were doing the same and playing football behind our trenches. 

'In the afternoon we went out and met them on “no man’s land”. I went out and found a German who spoke English a little and we exchanged buttons and cigarettes and I had two or three cigars given to me and we laughed and joked together.’

Anthony Richards, curator of documents and sound at the museum, said the button was ‘incredibly rare’.

He told the Mail: ‘While we know from contemporary accounts that souvenirs were exchanged between British and German soldiers involved in the Christmas truce, surviving examples of such mementos with proven provenance are incredibly rare. 

'The German uniform button kept by Eric Rowden is therefore an extremely unusual and important item, especially as it is accompanied by the postcard bearing the German’s name and unit as well as Rowden’s own detailed account of the Truce.

‘We are delighted to look after such an important collection.’ 

The torn postcard, complete with thumb-print marks and creases, suggests Cpl Rowden may have carried the button around with him for the rest of the war

Alongside his name, Werner Keil also wrote Zwickau, referring to a city in Saxony, Germany, presumably where he was from.

The day after the Christmas truce, Cpl Rowden left the trenches to go on leave back to England. He joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in October 1915 and continued to serve in France. In December 1916, he fell ill and was sent to Michelham Convalescent Home in the south of France, where he was treated for shell shock.

For his wartime service, he was awarded the 1914 Star, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal.

Cpl Rowden, of Chiswick in West London, died in 1968, at the age of 73.
