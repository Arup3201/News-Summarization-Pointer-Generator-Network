Russell Investments chief economist Mike Dueker was found dead Thursday, and police said it appeared he had taken his own life by jumping from a ramp near the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in Washington State.

His death is the latest in a series of untimely deaths among finance workers and business leaders around the world this past week.

An officer who knew Dueker was missing in the area spotted the body about 8:30 a.m. at the base of a 40- to 50-foot embankment for a Highway 16 ramp, Pierce County sheriff's spokesman Ed Troyer said.

Suicide: Russell Investments¿ Chief Economist Mike Dueker was found dead in an apparent suicide in the United States, the latest in a series of untimely deaths among finance workers and business leaders around the world this past week

Dueker, 50, had been missing since January 29, and friends and law enforcement had been searching for him

Dueker's car was parked at nearby War Memorial Park and it appears he jumped over the 4-foot fence of a bike-jogging trail along the ramp, Troyer said.

Police do not believe the death was an accident or that Dueker was a victim of a crime, Troyer said.

Dueker, 50, of University Place, apparently died early Wednesday when his family thought he was out jogging. But he was not dressed for jogging and was wearing jeans and a sweater, Troyer said. His family had been looking for him. The body was hard to spot, Troyer said.

Dueker had joined the financial services company in 2008. A spokeswoman, Jennifer Tice, said she couldn't speculate on any issues Dueker had.

Career man: Dueker worked at Seattle-based Russell for five years, and developed a business-cycle index that forecast economic performance. He was previously an assistant vice president and research economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis

'We were deeply saddened to learn today of the death of our colleague and friend Mike Dueker. Mike was highly respected and regarded at Russell Investments and in the broader financial services industry.

In the five years that he worked at Russell, he made valuable contributions that helped our clients and many of his fellow associates. Our thoughts are with Mike's family and friends during this difficult time,' Russell Investments said in a statement.

As chief economist for Russell Investments, Dueker wrote for Russell's Market Outlook publications, forecasting the business cycle and the target federal funds rate. He developed and maintained a business cycle index published monthly on Russell.com.

Well-respected: Dueker had published dozens of research papers over the past two decades, many on monetary policy, according to the St. Louis Fed¿s website, which ranks him among the top 5% of economists by number of works published

Dueker also led Russell's participation as one of 50 Blue Chip forecasters for both Blue Chip Economic Indicators and Blue Chip Financial Forecasts.

The suicide in Washington follows a series of deaths among finance workers and business leaders this past week.

Last Sunday, police in London found William Broeksmit, a 58-year-old former senior executive at Deutsche Bank AG, dead in his home after an apparent suicide, and on Tuesday, 39-year-old Gabriel Magee, a JP Morgan employee, died after falling from the roof of its the European headquarters of JP Morgan in London.

Mr Magee's parents have today told of their grief of their son who had worked as Vice President in the technology department for six years.

He was said to be in a happy relationship with a long-term girlfriend.

His parents, Bill, 64, and Nell, 74, Magee are now demanding answers to how he could have got up on to the roof of the building in Canary Wharf before he fell 500ft on Tuesday morning.

'We are shattered beyond words. This was a young man, we cherished him,' said Mrs Magee, 74.

'He was named after the angel Gabriel, the messenger who always had good news. He always brought us good news.'

She said: 'I’ve spoken to the embassy, the police. I want to know the truth. I want to know what happened.

'How was he able to get up there. There was no reason for him to be up on that roof.'

The executive had recently agreed with his bosses that he could work four days a week instead of five and was thought to be planning a family with his partner.

His father, a former US military pilot, last spoke to his son a fortnight ago and said that he seemed content.

'It was very comforting to see him in a relationship that he thought had longevity,' he said.

Mr and Mrs Magee will be travelling to London in the coming days.

Tragic: The parents of Gabriel Magee are demanding answers after he jumped from the top of JP Morgan's headquarters in Canary Wharf, London, to his death yesterday

Mrs Nell revealed that Gabriel was in a long term relationship with his girlfriend Veronica, whose family are from San Diego, and that they were planning a family together.

Her son was also a talented musician and loved playing his guitar.

Nell said: 'I want to know why JP Morgan has not had the decency to call me. I’ve spoken to the embassy, the coroner, the police.

Nell said that as far as she knew Gabriel was 'a happy person who was happy with his life'.

He and Veronica were not engaged but 'had an understanding' and were going to spend the rest of their lives together.

Nell said: 'There was no reason for him to up on that roof'.

Furious: The Magees said they would be demanding answers from JP Morgan, revealing that nobody from the company had 'had the decency' to call them after their son Gabriel plunged to his death

Gabriel's parents revealed that he had recently started working four days a week instead of five, a deal his bosses were happy with.

His body was found on the ninth floor roof of the JP Morgan office, which serves as its European HQ.

He was named in an email sent to all JP Morgan staff Tuesday afternoon.

A company spokesman said: 'We are deeply saddened to have lost a member of the J.P. Morgan family at 25 Bank Street today. Our thoughts and sympathy are with his family and his friends'.

A source close to Gabriel said he was in 'good standing with his bosses and colleagues. He was well liked.'

Investigation: Scotland Yard said they were called to 25 Bank Street at 8.02 a.m. yesterday and detectives were not treating Gabriel Magee's death as suspicious

Scene: Gabriel Magee, who'd worked for the company for nearly two decades,  fell from the top of the 33-storey JP Morgan skyscraper shortly after 8am on Tuesday

On Sunday, former Deutsche Bank senior manager, William 'Bill' Broeksmit, 58, was found hanging in his home in South Kensington

Location: The body of William 'Bill' Broeksmit, 58, was found at his home in South Kensington, central London
