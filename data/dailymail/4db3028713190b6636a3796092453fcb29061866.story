Floyd Mayweather was out and about Monday evening just hours after he witnessed a gruesome murder-suicide. 

The champion boxer was photographed as he attended the Los Angeles Clippers and Phoenix Suns basketball game Monday shortly after his friend Earl Hayes reportedly killed his girlfriend, Stephanie Moseley, before shooting himself.

Mayweather is said to have been on FaceTime with Hayes and watched as the horrific incident unfolded.

According to a source who spoke to TMZ, '[Mayweather] was pleading with him to get a grip ... to no avail.'

They added that he will not say how much he saw, but he acknowledges he was a witness and heard everything. 

Hayes is reported to have been upset with Moseley over her relationship with singer and rapper Trey Songz.

The two had allegedly had an affair years earlier, and though Hayes and Moseley reconciled, he is said to have never gotten over her infidelity.

Songz took to Twitter shortly after the tragedy, writing; 'R.I.P babygirl. Once an angel on earth, now watching over us from Heaven. You'll b missed but never forgotten. Love.'

Police rushed to the couple's apartment early Monday morning after there were reports of gunshots and a woman screaming.

A SWAT team was eventually forced to break down the door, and found the door to one of the bedrooms locked.

They then heard two gunshots, and when they entered found both Hayes and Moseley dead.

Moseley was an actress who appeared on the VH1 series Hit the Floor as well as films including The Twlight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1, Mirror Mirror and Sparkle.

She was also a successful backup dancer who had worked with artists including Usher and Chris Brown.

Brown also posted a tribute to Moseley on his Instagram Monday, writing; 'RIP baby girl. Danced with me on tour and was always the coolest person. My prayers go out to you and HAZE family.' 

He later took the post down.
