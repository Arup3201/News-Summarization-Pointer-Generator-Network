A Long Island man shot dead his fiancée Sunday morning in front of his children and had a shootout with police before eventually surrendering.

Jose Rodriguez III, 32, shot dead fiancée Kimberly Sellitto, 36, before firing several shots at responding police while his three children watched in horror, authorities said.

Mr Rodriguez eventually turned himself in and was charged with second-degree murder.

Out of nowhere: Jose Rodriguez III, 32, shot dead fiancée Kimberly Sellitto, 36, at their Long Island home late Sunday morning

Officers responding just after 11.30 Sunday morning discovered a woman’s body in front of the Ridge, NY apartment complex where the couple lived.

Locked and loaded, Mr Rodriguez pumped several shotgun rounds at responding officers. No police were injured, but a police vehicle sustained minor damage while cops were firing back at the violent man.

Police were able to negotiate the release of Mr Rodriguez’s two children – Ms Sellitto was not their mother – before eventually convincing him to surrender at about 1:45, the Suffolk County Police Department said in an official statement.

Neither Mr Rodriguez nor the children were hurt during the tense standoff, authorities said, adding they were put into their mother’s custody.

They were going to marry: The pair was engaged and had been together for seven years

The children, both younger than seven-years-old, were not taken as hostages, but unfortunately were inside the apartment as the traumatic events unfolded, a source told Newsday.

The deranged gunman fired six shots at officers, Newsday reported.

Ms Sellitto’s lifeless body remained on the ground until 7.40pm, the source added.

No motive has yet been established, but a woman identified as Mr Rodriguez’s sister told Newsday their relationship was tumultuous from the start.

‘He wanted to be happy with her, but in the inside he was screaming, he felt like the only people he had were his kids,’ Stephanie Rodriguez told the paper.

‘I told him I would never leave his side,’ she added, saying that her tormented brother wanted to leave Ms Sellitto.

The pair met seven years ago in a tattoo parlor where the accused killer worked, the sister noted.Pictures posted to social media show a seemingly happy couple.

Stunned friends posted messages of disbelief online.

'Wishing this was all just a bad dream,' wrote Cassi Lopez, later adding ' I'm ok. Just some crazy s**t going on. Trying to wrap my head around it all.'

'Me too...I tried so hard so many times,' one of her friends replied.

'I can't believe it either,' wrote another.

Days at the beach with Mr Rodriguez’s children are peppered in with pictures of the happy couple kissing and showing off tattoos.

There was no outward indication the couple was in trouble, but Mr Rodriguez’s sister said otherwise.

‘You can only push a person so much before they break.’

Mr Rodriguez is scheduled to be arraigned Monday.
