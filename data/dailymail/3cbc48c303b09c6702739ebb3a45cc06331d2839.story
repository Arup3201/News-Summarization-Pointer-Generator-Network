Two sisters have been killed in a car crash in Morocco while on the ‘adventure of a lifetime’.

Tara Darlington, 23, and her 21-year-old sister Pippa – described by their parents as best friends – died when their rented car collided with another vehicle early on Monday morning.

Their friend Joshua Stump, 21, was seriously injured and is in a coma in hospital, police said yesterday.

The accident happened near the 
north-western city of Rabat during a holiday before the sisters began 
their final year of university.

They had been travelling through Africa and had been in Mauritania two weeks ago.

The sisters’ parents, Patrick and Emma
Darlington, said yesterday: ‘We are as a family completely devastated 
at the loss of both our daughters, Tara and Pippa.

‘They were two of the most beautiful, 
dynamic, energetic and fun-loving girls who brought light and laughter 
to whoever met them.

Trip of a lifetime: The sisters and their friend had been holidaying in Morocco when the accident happened near Rabat (pictured)

‘They made a difference to so many 
lives and they lit up every room on entering. This trip was to be an 
adventure of a lifetime for which they had planned, worked hard and 
saved together for months.

‘They were joined on this adventure by
Josh Stump who is in a coma fighting for his life in Rabat Hospital. 
Our thoughts and prayers are for him and his parents and little sister 
Emily.’  The sisters were from Whiteparish, near Salisbury, Wiltshire. 
Joshua is from Salisbury.

Mr Darlington, 62, a director of the 
Yellow Bike Company, and his 52-year-old wife, a life coach, added that 
Tara and Pippa were the best of friends ‘who loved doing everything 
together’.

They continued: ‘The “Darlington 
double” were each others’ soulmates. They spoke last week of such a 
fabulous trip, golden sands next to an azure sea, with guaranteed 
sunshine and plenty of fish caught by  Josh. They were having the time 
of their life and promised to be home in ten days.

‘Tara and Pips were everything to each
other and also everything to us. They will be desperately missed. They 
will be forever young and together.’

The sisters’ brother, Oscar, 15, said: ‘They are my darling sisters and I love them very much.

‘I was just reaching an age where we 
could do things together. Gone so soon but will never be forgotten and 
always in my heart.’  Tara was studying media, journalism and sociology 
at Goldsmiths, University of London, and had begun Savvy Social Media, 
her own small enterprise, offering ‘social media solutions’ to small 
businesses.

She also worked for Spashion.com, an 
online magazine about sport and fashion. She had already been offered a 
role in New York to take up after she finished university.

The couple’s statement added: ‘Tara 
was beautiful, charming and vivacious; she had an energy and passion for
everything she did.

‘Fiercely family-orientated with high 
moral standards and integrity, Tara’s smile lit up the room and her 
energy bounced off the walls.’

Pippa was studying law at Newcastle University.

‘Typical of her vitality, strength of 
mind and ambition, Pippa was originally refused a place in the law 
school despite her three As at A-level,’ her parents said.

‘She challenged the head of law, asked to go and see him, which she finally did and won the place.

‘Pips brought fun, life and laughter 
to all. Gregarious, kind and thoughtful and particularly loyal, Pippa 
must have had six jobs on the go to accumulate funds for the trip.’
