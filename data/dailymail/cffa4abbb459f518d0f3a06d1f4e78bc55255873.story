For Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin, the past year has been one of disbelief, unspeakable grief, and of action.

Her son was killed last February by armed Neighborhood Watch captain George Zimmerman, launching a battle over the controversial ‘Stand Your Ground’ law, as well as a fight for civil rights.

Speaking of her late son, Ms Fulton said: ‘I never said he was perfect, but he was mine.’

Martin had been staying with his father, Tracy Martin, at the Retreat at Twin Lakes residences, a gated community within the town of Sanford, Florida after being found at school with an empty marijuana baggie.

Ms Fulton spoke with the Washington Post today over the past year, saying that it’s been difficult to come to terms with Martin’s death. 

‘From that day until now, I’m still in disbelief,’ the mother said.

Zimmerman claims he shot Martin out of self defense after Martin attacked him, but the attorneys for the Martin family claim that the white Hispanic man was racially profiling the black teenager. 

Speaking tonight on CNN’S ‘Piers Morgan Tonight,’ Ms Fulton said that she and Martin’s father plan to honor the anniversary of their son’s death by attending a candlelight vigil in New York.

Tracy Martin also added that in light of recent events, from the shootings in Aurora to Newtown, ‘it’s time for America to take a look at our gun laws.’

He added: ‘It’s too much senseless violence.’

Their lawyer, Benjamin Crump, added that he hopes the trial will bring to light the problems surrounding the ‘Stand Your Ground’ law, which Mr Crump said encourages ‘vigilante justice.’

Asked about the trial and whether or not she hopes Zimmerman is found guilty, Ms Fulton said: ‘We’ve just asked for (the case) to come to trial. Whatever decision the jury makes, we may not like it, but we’re going to accept it.’

Evidence in the case was slow to trickle out; Sanford police did not immediately arrest or charge Zimmerman with any crime, and the photographs they took of Zimmerman from that night, apparently with bloodied head wounds and a broken nose, were also slow to be released. 

Zimmerman has been raising money for his defense, including attorney Mark O’Mara. According to his defense website, Zimmerman has raised more than $314,000 to pay legal fees and his $95,000 bond, but may have to pay more than $1million by the time the trial is done. 

His website states that the defense hopes to begin a Self-Defense Immunity Hearing on April 22. If Zimmerman is not granted immunity, a trial is scheduled to commence on June 10, 2013.

Since posting bond, Zimmerman has been living at an undisclosed rental house in Seminole County with his wife. 

Zimmerman is also in a legal battle against NBC, and is suing the network following an edit of the original 911 dispatch tapes. He claims that the tapes were edited to be more sensational, cutting together Zimmerman saying that Martin ‘looks black’ and appeared to be ‘up to no good.’ 

At the time of the lawsuit, NBC Universal said the claims were unfounded. ‘There was no intent to portray Mr Zimmerman unfairly,’ the company said in a statement, adding: ‘We intend to vigorously defend our position in court.’ 

In the weeks after the shooting, thousands of people marched through Sanford, demanding Zimmerman's arrest. T-shirts and posters of Martin sold rapidly on Sanford streets, with people holding posters and chanting ‘Justice for Trayvon,’ many of them carrying Martin’s final purchase from a 7Eleven – Skittles and Arizona iced tea.

The protests stopped after Jacksonville prosecutor Angela Corey took over the investigation and filed second-degree murder charges against Zimmerman a month and a half after Martin's shooting. 

At the height of the protests last March, national civil rights leaders such as the Rev. Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson and the NAACP's Ben Jealous had vowed to turn Martin's shooting into a movement addressing equal justice under the law, as well as 'stand your ground' laws that allow people to use deadly force if their lives are in danger. 

While those issues have retreated somewhat in the national discussion, they haven't in Sanford, where race relations and concerns about traditionally underrepresented communities have moved to the forefront.

'It's on our minds all the time,' City Manager Norton Bonaparte told the AP. He is black.

'Out of tragedy comes opportunity,' said Mayor Jeff Triplett, who is white. 'There was a scab over the wound of race relations, and this event opened it up.'
