This is the moment a rare World War Two German float plane was raised from its saltwater grave virtually intact – almost 70 years after it sank.

The twin-engined Heinkel He-115 torpedo bomber was hoisted out of the water by engineers and divers in a recovery operation in a fjord near Stavanger, Norway.

Now there are hopes the plane will be restored to its former glory and may one day fly again despite it sinking 120ft down to the silty sea floor in 1942 after it was damaged during a botched water landing.

Emerging from the depths: The tail section of the Heinkel He-115 is pulled from the fjord off Stavanger, Norway after spending almost 70 years under water

Restoration begins: Volunteers and engineers prepare the floatplane for transportation after it was lifted by crane to the shore

Nose section: The remains of the aircraft aircraft are in remarkably good condition, including the perspex around the cockpit and one of the engines, left

The decision to attempt to recover Heinkel 8L+FH was made after its discovery in 2005 during sonar-equipment testing by the Norwegian Mapping Authority.

Divers found the aircraft, along with two bombs, which were removed and later destroyed.

The condition of the plane is considered to be remarkable, owing to it having lain in low-oxygen silt in a part of the fjord where currents are minimal.

Tailplane: The Nazi swastika and identification number is clearly visible next to the plane's rudder

Recovery operation: Years in the planning, last month's raising of the bomber was the result of sponsorship of local companies

Wing section: Although showing some minor damage to the tips, the plane's wings appear strong despite decades in salty water

After a fundraising effort by enthusiasts and sponsorship from local firms, volunteers were last month able to raise it from the depths leaving it suspended below the surface from a barge.

It was then transported to the shore in Hafrsfjord by tugs and crane-lifted out of the water.

Before the final lift divers spent several hours washing out silt from within the aircraft to reduce the weight and the risk of the plane breaking apart when it was moved.

First glimpse: Divers and other volunteers take a peek into the plane's interior through its damaged nose cone

Propellers: Just one BMW engine remains on the plane after German engineers removed the other in 1942 after a botched landing led to the plane sinking

Crowd-pleaser: Local people watched the bomber lifted from the waves by crane

Oliver Scott, 31, a British oil worker who witnessed the recovery, said: ‘It was extraordinary to see plane emerge from the water looking as if it was only lost yesterday.

‘It was in remarkably good condition, you could see the swastika on the tail plane and a machine gun still had a belt of ammunition attached.’

Armament: The plane's protective machine gun is handled by a worker. An ammunition belt can still be seen leading into the weapon

Carried away: A diver in a heavy-duty wetsuit takes a weapon away, left, while workers inspect the engine, right

Rare find: The plane is the only salvaged Heinkel He-115 in existence and there are hopes it can be restored to flying condition

Recovery workers then took the plane to Sola Airport in Stavanger where aircraft museum workers dismantled it into five sections before placing it in a freshwater tank where it will remain for two years.

The museum is already restoring a number of rare wartime aircraft, including a Messerschmitt BF-109G, an Italian Caproni bomber and a German Arado trainer, in addition to a BMW engine identical to the ones originally fitted to the Heinkel.

Remnants of silt and saltwater will be removed during the process, preparing it for further restoration in the same hanger from which it operated during World War Two.

Purchased by the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service from Nazi Germany in 1939, the bomber was later used in the ultimately unsuccessful battle against German forces.

The occupying Nazis then commandeered the plane, using it to bomb Allied shipping, reconnaissance and to escort its own vessels.

The mid-sized, twin-engined float plane was returning from a convoy escort mission off Jæren when it lost a float on landing and overturned on 29 December 1942.

None of the aircrew were lost, and the Germans were able to salvage the starboard engine and floats before the bomber sank and came to rest upside-down just off Prestøya island, less than two nautical miles from its base.

Of some 300 aircraft made, 8L+FH is the only salvaged He-115 in existence.

Restoration begins: A worker gets inside the plane, before it is placed in five fresh water tanks to be washed

Protection: The seaplane was returning from convoy escort duties when it was damaged in a landing accident

Wartime Nazi bomber: The Heinkel He-115 flying boat, pictured during World War Two, was used to attack shipping and in a reconnaissance role

Found: The plane was discovered by the island of Prestoy, and will be restored in a hanger at Stavanger Airport

A further three 'Norwegian' He-115s have been located in the Trondheimsfjord farther north, although these have been said to be in a comparatively poor state.

Hafrsfjord was the scene of an epic Viking naval battle in 872 A.D., which according to most history books was a direct precursor to the unification of Norway, and has previously yielded all manner of artefacts from the Viking era.
