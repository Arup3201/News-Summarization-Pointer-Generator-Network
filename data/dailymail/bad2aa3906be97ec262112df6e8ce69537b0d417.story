Diego Costa was left with a face as red as his shirt after offering up a contender for miss of the season in Spain's Euro 2016 qualifier with Luxembourg.

The striker inexplicably fired wide when played through one-on-one with goalkeeper Jonathan Joubert after 32 minutes of the match at the Josy Barthel Stadium.

It looked easier for the Chelsea man to find the net from such point-blank range but his attempted dink was scuffed and went past the far post.

The striker lifts his shirt over his head in embarrassment but his blushes were spared by an offside flag

Costa has been in outstanding form since joining Chelsea, scoring nine goals in nine matches

As Costa lifted his shirt over his head in embarrassment, he would have been relieved to learn that he'd been flagged offside though he had no idea initially.

Costa is in sensational form for his club, with nine goals in nine matches since his £32m move from Atletico Madrid in the summer, but has struggled to find the net for his country.

He squandered a succession of chances during the first half, as goals by David Silva and his strike partner Paco Alcacer gave Spain a commanding lead over the Group C minnows.

But he did eventually score his first goal for his country, firing home in the second half to make it 3-0 from close range. The relief on his face was apparent for all to see. 

Juan Bernat scored a late fourth goal to round off the comprehensive victory.

Vicente del Bosque's team desperately needed a morale-boosting win after a shock defeat to Slovakia on Thursday. 

Speaking about his goal afterwards, Costa said: 'The truth is it was annoying me quite a lot. I could not score. I did not score, and the team lost the games I played. I did not know how I was going to score.

'But thanks to God the ball dropped for me, and I just had to put it in. I must thank the boss, every game was another chance for me to show what I can do. I hope from now things will go well for me.'

And coach Del Bosque added: 'We’re all happy he has scored. He worked hard, lacked luck in front of goal. He will be a useful player for us. When a player puts in so much effort, wants it so much, in the end it will go for him.'
