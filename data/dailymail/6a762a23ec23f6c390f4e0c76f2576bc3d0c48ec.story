She grew up in London and embraced a party lifestyle while living in the capital but now Pearl Lowe has admitted she's much more at home living in the country.

The fashion and textile designer, 43, told this month's Country Homes & Interiors magazine that she's never been happier since she moved to a Georgian sandstone house near Frome, Somerset.

'I'd say it's the freedom to be myself. 
In London, there was so much pressure to wear the right clothes, have 
the right bag,' she explained.

She added that 'there's so much I love about Somerset' because there's 'a lot of creative people here' so her and her husband, Supergrass drummer Danny Goffey, 'sort of fit in'.

Pearl and Danny, who have three children, Alfie, 16, Frankie, 13, and Betty, seven, married in the county in 2008 and Pearl has decked out their home with items she's found in local flea markets and vintage shops.

She added that another perk of country living was the lower prices.

'You can buy unbelievable vintage dresses for a quarter of what you'd pay in London,' she said.

In her youth, Pearl was a regular on the party circuit in London's Primrose Hill counting stars including Kate Moss, Jude Law and Patsy Kensit in her circle of friends.

She married Bronner Handwerger when she 
fell pregnant with daughter Daisy, now a successful model, at the age of
19. Daisy discovered after taking a DNA test when she was a teenager
that her real father is Bush singer Gavin Rossdale.

Pearl talked openly about her battle with drug addiction during her twenties in her autobiography.

'It was a never-ending party,' she revealed. 'Yet I was utterly miserable. There wasn't a night I didn't go to bed in tears or a morning I didn't wake up feeling despair, guilt and self-loathing. Why? I was hopelessly addicted to drugs.'

Her current country idyll is a far cry from her former lifestyle and she said she and her younger children (Daisy still lives in London) 'have blossomed' in their home that's surrounded by trees with a brook at end of the garden.

After giving County Homes magazine a tour of her home she admitted: 'I’ve found a sanctuary here, a place of renewal and growth - somewhere to rest.

'We’re close to Glastonbury, so there’s also the healing aspect.'
