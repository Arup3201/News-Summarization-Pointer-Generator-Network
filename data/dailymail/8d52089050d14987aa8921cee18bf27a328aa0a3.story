A transexual woman desperate to complete her journey has entered Deal Or No Deal to fund her next operation.

Hinoi Tonkin, who was born Keith, has applied to the popular TV quiz show fronted by Noel Edmonds in the hope of winning enough money to pay for a thigh lift after she lost 12 stone.

The 30-year-old, who says she was miserable in a man's body, is seeking funds after the NHS refused to pay for the surgery prior to her gender reassignment operation due to take place next year.

Hinoi Tonkin, who was born a man but is 
currently undergoing a gender reassignment programme, has lost 12 stone 
in weight to help become the woman she always wanted to be and is now seeking funds to pay for a cosmetic thigh lift

Hinoi, from Middlesborough, has already spent £15,000 having a tummy tuck and laser treatment and now wants the thigh lift after working hard to lose weight.

She said: 'I want to do it to get the money for my operation. I also want to show people that we're not freaks, we're all human.'

Hinoi's 62-year-old mother Margaret, who helped foot the £15,000 bill, added in a report in the Sunday Post: 'We’ve used all our savings. I’ve got nothing left. I’ve told her to go for it to see if she can win some more money.'

Hinoi is due to have £10,000 gender reassignment surgery on the NHS next year but after dropping  from 21 stone to a svelte nine, she was turned down by the NHS for an operation to remove excess skin from her thighs.

She believes that this operation is vital to turn her into a complete woman but health chiefs have decided that Hinoi, who was diagnosed with gender dysphoria, doesn't have the 'significant' mental health problems to warrant the taxpayer footing the bill.

Gender dysphoria is a medical condition where the person believes they have been born the wrong sex.

Speaking to The Sun, Hinoi said: 'I didn't act or think like other boys and that realisation meant I was miserable. I was binge eating to punish the body I hated so much.'

The IT specialist would stay 
in her room and gorge on eight fried eggs, eight pieces of toast and 
packets of crisps in the middle of the night because she was so 
miserable.

The computer programmer never felt confident in his body as a man and when he saw his sisters at a wedding in their bridesmaid dresses he knew it was time to make the change

After her mother found her wearing a skirt in 2009 Hinoi finally plucked up the courage to visit a gender clinic and underwent a course of drugs to block testosterone

Realisation hit when her elder sister Sharon got married in 2006 and her other sister Pamela was a bridesmaid.

Hinoi said: 'I was so jealous of how they looked. I felt like an imposter in my suit, knowing I was living a lie.'

After
 her mother found Hinoi wearing a skirt in 2009, she finally plucked up 
the courage to visit a gender clinic and underwent a course of drugs to 
block testosterone.

As she began to change into the 'new 
her', Hinoi ditched her fattening diet and swapped the fried food for 
diet shakes and salads, which she combined with mile-long daily walks.

Within
 eighteen months, she became unrecognisable to anyone who had known her 
before and finally felt comfortable and confident in her body.

She
 added: 'I can get into glamorous skirts and dresses and now I have 
these hips. I love to shake them on the dancefloor- it's where I'm at my 
happiest.'

  The show starts with 22 identical sealed boxes. The independent adjudicator loads and seals all the boxes. No one but the independent adjudicator knows what is in the boxes. At the beginning of the show one contestant is chosen from the line up, either from the West Wing or the East Wing. In the first round the player must choose five boxes before the first offer from the Banker. The player must then decide on whether to take the offer. Noel then asks them the question, Deal or No Deal? The player must answer either, Deal to accept the offer or No Deal to decline the offer and carry on. In the second round 3 boxes are opened before the player receives another offer from the Banker. Again Noel will ask them the question. Three boxes are opened in the third, fourth and fifth round followed by the question Deal or No Deal. If the player decides to No Deal they will continue in this fashion until only two boxes remain. When the last two boxes remain the Banker will give his final offer. If the player says No Deal at this point, the Banker may offer the player to swap their box with the other remaining box. The player may decline or accept the swap.
