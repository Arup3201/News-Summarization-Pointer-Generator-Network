Professor Gennadij Raivich, 52, from North London, set up an online 'breeding programme'  to artificially inseminate women desperate to start a family

A neuroscientist who claims to have fathered 58 children while running a 'one-stop shop' sperm donor programme has walked free from court after being convicted of molesting one of his clients.

Professor Gennadij Raivich, 52, from North London, set up a 'breeding programme' on the internet to artificially inseminate women who were desperate to start a family. 

The academic - who has three children of his own - visited the women at home and pretended he was trying to help them.

But a court heard how Raivich 'exploited' women who were 'desperate to conceive' from his own 'sexual gratification'.

He even told victim Claire Long that her chances of becoming pregnant would be increased if she orgasmed during the insemination process, the court was told.

The professor, an expert in maternal and foetal medicine who worked at University College London, was found guilty in July this year of sexually assaulting Ms Long. He was cleared of abusing two other women. 

But he avoided being jail today after the judge said he had already suffered a loss of reputation and employment. 

Judge Deva Pillay told him: 'Publicly it is said you were an internationally recognised and respected scientific researcher, however in private you led a more questionable lifestyle.

'Using the pseudonym Frank Qualman you surfed the internet offering your services as a sperm donor to women desperate to conceive.

'These were informal and devoid of the usual regulations and safeguards and the Crown say you exploited your anonymity and your clients' desperation to conceive to obtain sexual gratification.' 

During the two-week trial, Blackfriars Crown Court, South East London, heard that Raivich advertised his services online and carried out home visits around the country.

He also trawled websites including tadpoletown.co.uk and gayfamilyoption.com looking for potential clients. 

Using the pseudonym Frank Qualman, he coined the phrase 'Artificial Insemination Plus', which promised 'extras' to donors.

He carried a 'donation kit' with him containing a DVD player so he could watch pornography, rubber gloves and laboratory equipment.

But he was arrested over allegations of sexual assault.

Victim Claire Long, who has waived her right to anonymity, was groped during a consultation with Raivich on 27 November 2012

During the trial, the court heard how Ms Long - whom he first met in September 2012 - travelled from her Cambridgeshire village to his London home and agreed to repeatedly perform oral sex on him to obtain the samples she craved.

She couldn’t afford to pay for private fertility treatment and the NHS wouldn’t treat her because she was single. She believed a free sperm donation was her only option. 

She told the court she went along with the man's request for her to perform a sex act on him - on several occasions - because she had been trying to conceive for a year and was desperate for success.

The former nanny, who has waived her right to anonymity, was groped during a consultation with Raivich on 27 November 2012.

Not only was she subjected to the unwanted touching, but Ms Long did not conceive as a result of her contact with the professor, the court heard. 

In a video-recorded police interview played to the jury, she said: 'He laid sofa cushions on the floor and was taking his trousers off and said he wanted AI Plus because it would be quick and he did not have time to provide the sample himself.

'With my baby brain I agreed to AI Plus and he took his underwear off and lay on the floor and I performed AI Plus and the donation was ready in thirty seconds.

'While I was doing AI Plus he asked me to take my clothes off so he could touch me.

'I said I did not mind doing AI Plus, but did not want to do anything else, but he put his hand on my bottom over my jeans then kept trying to put his hands down my waistband and up my top.'  

Following his arrest, 15 women who had children by him came to his defence, including a police officer, a maths teacher and a lecturer, some of whom had two and in one case three of his children via Artificial Insemination (AI). 

Raivich is a qualified doctor in Germany, but has never practised medicine and is not registered with the General Medical Council. 

Raivich's service was informal and did not conform to the guidelines of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. 

He once gave an interview in which he described being a sperm donor as 'like a hobby or charitable act' and said that he got 'satisfaction by helping'.

He also said that he offered his services as a donor and as a doctor because he 'loved children' and wanted others to enjoy parenthood. 

Defending, Raivich's lawyer William Clegg QC said: 'The victim was engaging in consensual oral sex with the defendant at the time. She was a lady that had agreed full intercourse with donors in attempts to become pregnant.'

He also showed Judge Deva Pillay an article from magazine 'Take a Break' to which the victim sold her story.

He said: 'She's abandoned her anonymity and made what capital she can out of her position.

'He's been forced to resign his chair at UCH and is unemployed. He lost a well paid and prestigious job. That indeed is a tragedy in itself.

'He is acknowledged as a world authority on trauma to the brain in children and in lesser respects adults and intends to return to his family in Germany when these proceedings are concluded and re-train in another area.

'She was clearly a very willing participant in oral sex, which reduces, to some extent, the gravity of the offence.'  

He was sentenced to nine months imprisonment, suspended for two years.

He was also ordered to pay £5,000 costs and to sign the sex offenders' register for ten years. He is also subject to an indefinite Sexual Offences Prevention Order banning him from being a sperm donor or carrying a speculum.
