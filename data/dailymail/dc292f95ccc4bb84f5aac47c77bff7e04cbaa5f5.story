Lewis Hamilton is excited and encouraged by the news that Michael Schumacher is out of a coma after nearly six months.

Schumacher, the seven-time Formula One world champion, suffered severe head injuries following a ski accident in the French resort of Meribel last December.

Updates on his condition have been sparse, but Schumacher’s spokeswoman revealed on Monday that the German is now out of his medically-induced coma and has left Grenoble Hospital where he has been receiving treatment since the accident on December 29.

‘It is amazing. Everywhere I go people ask about him. Whether it is the States, Canada – filling up a petrol station – people ask about him,’ said Hamilton. 

‘I always keep him in my thoughts and prayers and it is a real positive to hear that there is some progress.

‘I have been trying to keep an ear out for what is going on and not really hearing of any improvements.

‘So to hear that he is really in that wake-up phase is just really encouraging and it is exciting, and the next step, and hopefully this is the first step on the ladder.’

Schumacher is now being treated at the University Hospital of the Canton of Vaud in Lausanne, Switzerland, 20 miles from home on the shore of Lake Geneva.

‘Michael has left the CHU Grenoble to continue his long phase of rehabilitation. He is not in a coma anymore,’ Schuamcher’s spokeswoman Sabine Kehm said on Monday.

‘His family would like to thank all his doctors, nurses and therapists in Grenoble as well as the first aiders at the place of the accident, who did an excellent job in those first months.

‘The family also wishes to thank all the people who have sent Michael all the many good wishes. We are sure it helped him.

‘For the future we ask for understanding that his further rehabilitation will take place away from the public eye.’
