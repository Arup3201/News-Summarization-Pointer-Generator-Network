It is New York's best kept secret - apparently.

According to newly revealed records, Neir's Tavern is the oldest bar in the city.  

The rustic gin hall in Queen's opened in 1829, is said to have hosted Mae West's first ever performance and numerous movies including a scene in Goodfellas.

It means McSorley's Old Ale House in the East Village - whose motto is 'we were here before you were born' - is pushed into second place, having opened in 1854.

New York's best kept secret? According to newly revealed records, Neir's Tavern is the oldest bar in the city

Pushed into second place? McSorley's Old Ale House in the East Village claims to be the oldest 

However, Gregory de la Haba, publican of McSorley's, refuses to relinquish his grip on the accolade.

McSorley's is credited as the city's oldest Irish pub, and was 'men only' until 1970 when it was forced to admit women. 

He insists theirs was the only bar to serve New Yorkers through the prohibition.

'McSorley’s is the oldest continuously operating bar in New York City,' he told the New York Daily News, adding, 'and it’s the most authentic — hands down.'

'What you are looking for is authenticity and not age.'

Neir's opened as The Blue Pump Room by the owner of a racecourse which was then across the street.

Claim to fame: Robert DeNiro filmed part of Goodfellas in the Queens-based bar Neir's

Now, 180 years after opening as a racecourse watering hole, it has a new set of regulars 

Authentic: The place was renovated to restore the original mahogany work put in by Louis Neir in 1898

It has original art framed on the wall, around the floor where Mae West allegedly first performed

Celebration: Local historians are excited about the newly-revealed documents that bring pride to the area

History in writing: Documents that chart the history of the bar are now framed on the walls 

Understated: The bar claims to 'quietly serve cold beer' rather than boasting about their heritage

In 1835 it was renamed The Old Abbey. 

According to Neir's website, the racecourse went through a bumpy financial patch, and the bar became known as a 'notorious rumseller' for 'black legs, thieves, housebreakers [and] fighting men'.

It was bought in 1851 by a politician who maintained it for 40 years, before a man named Louis Neir arrived in 1898.

Neir's Social Hall, as he dubbed it, was extended to include a ballroom, bowling alley, and hotel rooms. 

It was sold in 1967 and renamed the Union Course Tavern, which closed in 2009. 

The current owners finished constructing Neir's mahogany bars, and reopened as Neir's Tavern.

Battle of the bars? McSorley's, a favorite among Manhattanites, has long been touted the oldest in New York

It was one of the last 'men only' bars in New York until it was forced to admit women in 1970

One of the bar's mottoes is said to be 'We were here before you were born'

Another of the mottoes inscribed above this cabinet is 'be good or be gone'

Every piece of paraphernalia and memorabilia ever hung on the walls remains, including badges and boards

Atmospheric: The Irish pub still has a rustic feel to it, which New Yorkers relish in the winter

According to the Queens Tribune, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta became regulars at the watering hole while filming Goodfellas and harboring a deep affection for it.

Ben Stiller's 2011 movie Tower Heist also featured scenes in the bar, causing the owners to close down for four days.

Queens Historical Society's Richard Hourahan, who read through the archived documents, told the Daily News: 'I'm really excited about what this means for Queens. 

'It shows some of our cultural and social history.' 

The owners of Neir's appear less fussed about fighting their corner for the title. 

The bar's website states: 'While many older bars tout how old they are, Neirs has remained true to itself, quietly serving cold beer to our local customers for over 180 years.'
