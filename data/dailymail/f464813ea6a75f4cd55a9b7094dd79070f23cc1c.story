Sisters Charm and Brittani Niccole have both been given breast enhancements - by their plastic surgeon father.

The girls, from fashionable Orange County in California, are walking advertisements for their famous plastic surgeon parent, Dr Michael Niccole.

Brittani, 25, first had breast surgery as a gift for her 18th birthday when she went from an A cup to C.Then three years later Michael gave her a rhinoplasty for her 21st birthday, when he narrowed the bridge of her nose.

And shockingly, Charm first went under 
Michael's knife at the tender age of ten when she had her protruding 
belly button reshaped.

This year she also opted for a breast augmentation to take her from 32B to 32C - and didn't have to look far for a surgeon.

Charm, also 25, who works in 
marketing said: 'Having surgery done by my dad makes sense - he's the 
best at what he does and I know I'm in safe hands.

Growing up in Orange County and seeing so many people having surgery, it never seemed like a big deal to me.

'Out here cosmetic surgery is a normal part of everyday life. Since I had my boob job all my friends tell me that I look great.'

'I
 didn't want to go too big and I think this is my perfect size. You 
might not even know I'd had them done if you didn't know me.'

Both
 women regularly have facial peels and Botox at their dad's clinic, 
Cosmeticare Plastic Surgery Centre and Med Spa, to reduce the chances of
 wrinkles.

The sisters (Charm, left, Brittani, right), who were adopted by Michael
 and wife Penny as babies, have attracted criticism about their decision
 to cosmetically alter their appearance

Charm said: 'Every other month I'll get something done to my skin. '

'I think Botox is important because it prevents you from getting wrinkles. I also get Botox in my armpits, which helps me stop sweating.'

Unsurprisingly the sisters, who were adopted by Michael and wife Penny as babies, have attracted criticism about their decision to cosmetically alter their appearance.

However, the girls say they have valid reasons for making the most of their dad's skills.

Brittani, a make-up artist, said: 'I was totally flat chested so I just wanted to feel more comfortable in my own skin.

'When
 I first told my parents I wanted my breasts done I was about 15. I knew
 I had to wait until I was 18 but I was nagging them about it all the 
time.

'When I 
graduated high school Dad surprised me by saying, "I've scheduled you in
 to have your boobs done next week". I was so excited. 

Mother Penny was initially opposed to her daughters going under the knife to alter their appearance

The pair act as ambassadors for their dad's work, and say more and more young women are approaching their father Michael for cosmetic work

'It's the best thing I've ever done. I love my boobs now - they're perfect.'

But for some people having an intimate cosmetic produce done by their dad is a little too close to home.

'When Brittani first told me she wanted to get implants I I 
fought it for a long time. But she was so insistent that eventually I said "okay show me your breasts". Then I could see why she wanted implants'

Brittani said: 'Some people say, "Isn't it weird that your dad has seen your breasts?" and I say no.

'First of all I'm his daughter and he's seen me naked when I was a baby, so really who cares?'

'Secondly, he sees thousands of boobs a year so a boob to him is just an object like a pen. It's just what he does.'

And as ambassadors for their dad's work, more and more young women are approaching Michael for cosmetic work.

Charm
 said: 'Almost all of our friends have had procedures done by my dad, 
whether that's boob jobs, liposuction, Botox or skin peels.

'If there are ten people in a room, nine out of the ten people have had something done by my dad.

'Random people even will find me on Facebook and will say, "oh are you Dr. Niccole's daughter? I was thinking about getting this procedure done, can you help me?".

'I give their information to a consultant. It's a family business so I'm contributing and so it's good.'

However, not everyone was thrilled with the pair's enthusiasm for a quick fix.

Penny was initially opposed to her daughters going under the knife to alter their appearance. She said: "When Brittani first told me she wanted to get implants I I fought it for a long time. I said, "no we're not doing this, this is not right". 

'But she was so insistent that eventually I said "okay show me your breasts".

'Then I could see why she wanted implants and realised it would be beneficial for her to get her breasts enlarged, so I agreed.

'Now I can see she's so much more confident and I think she looks great.'

But when Brittani again turned to surgery a few years later to change her nose, Penny worried it was going to be a reoccurring trend.

Penny explained: 'I didn't want them to think they could just turn to surgery every time they didn't like something about their appearance.

'And I worried that with it being so readily available they could become addicted to plastic surgery.

'I told Brittani she was beautiful the way she was - we always try to stress, beauty is within.

'I fought it for a long time but when I saw how much she hated her nose, I gave in again.'

Last month Charm decided to have a breast augmentation after exercise had reduced the volume of her chest.

She said: 'I work out like a fanatic and I noticed my breasts got a lot smaller and I lost a lot of the volume in them.

'Dad wouldn't do the surgery unless I convinced my mum, so when I convinced her I had to sit her down a couple of different times and really tell her that I was serious about it.'

Despite continued criticism of their decision to have surgery, the sisters remain defiant. Charm says: 'Because of the criticism we have had for getting surgery done by our dad I realise people can be pretty ignorant'

Now the sisters turn heads everywhere they go and are constantly recommending impressed women to their dad's clinic.

Charm said: 'I went out to a restaurant the other night and started talking about the procedures and everything.

'My waiter actually wanted to come in to get Botox, so I took down her number and I booked her appointment to come in.

'In Orange County you are judged on your looks. there's just so much pressure on everyone to look perfect

'If you go or a job interview in the beauty industry, obviously the person who is better looking is going to get the job - that's just how it is here.'

But despite the continued criticism of their decision to have surgery, the sisters remain defiant. 

Charm said: 'Because of the criticism we have had for getting surgery done by our dad I realise people can be pretty ignorant.

'People should understand that we got procedures done because we didn't feel good about ourselves.'

And Michael can't deny that his daughters polished appearance is good for business. 

He said: 'There are people that would critique me for doing a breast augmentation on my daughter at 18.

'But I've been doing surgery for 30 years and I wanted the best of care, which I feel I can deliver to my daughter.

'Nobody, nobody would treat my daughter the way I would.

'I don't think I influenced my daughters personally to have surgery, because we discourage it.

'But they have grown up in an environment of beauty. Our cars are always immaculate, our house is immaculate and all our friends are beautiful.

'You could say they were influenced by that environment. They understand the importance of looking and maintaining your beauty the rest of their lives

'I felt very, very comfortable doing her surgery. And I would do it over again.

'The plastic surgical industry today is a thousand fold compared to when I first started.

'Before it was very hush-hush but these days people are having it and talking about it.

'People will come from all around the world to the United States to have cosmetic surgery.'

'You go to South America, you go to Argentina, I'll be you 50 per cent of the population have cosmetic surgery.'
