Prince Charles refused to support Sir Salman Rushdie during his fatwa over The Satanic Verses because he thought the book was offensive to Muslims.

In an article for Vanity Fair magazine, Martin Amis claimed that the Prince's views caused a row at a dinner party after Rushdie was issued with the death sentence by Islamic clerics in 1989.

Amis claims that Charles told him that he would not offer support ‘if someone insults someone else’s deepest convictions’.

What he really thought: But behind the scenes, Prince Charles refused to support Sir 
Salman (right) during his fatwa over The Satanic Verses because he 
thought the book was offensive to Muslims

Amis remonstrated with him but all Charles did was ‘take it on board’, even though Rushdie is a British-Indian citizen.

Rushdie’s fatwa was issued by Iran’s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini over the publication of The Satanic Verses, which supposedly insulted the Prophet Mohammed and The Koran.

The fatwa, or ‘spiritual opinion’, followed a wave of book burnings in Britain and rioting across the Muslim world which lead to the deaths of 60 people and hundreds being injured.

Rushdie was put under round-the-clock security at the expense of the British taxpayer when a £1.2million bounty was put on his head.

Deepest convictions: Martin Amis (pictured with Rushdie in 2010) said Charles told him that he would not offer support 'if someone insults someone else's deepest convictions'

Strong stance: The Vanity Fair article says novelist Stephen King (left) refused to let stores in America sell his books if they refused to carry The Satanic Verses. Charles’ lack of support for Rushdie 
comes at a time when he is under the spotlight for his supposed 
willingness to meddle in the affairs of others

In the Vanity Fair article Rushdie’s friends and literary colleagues such as Ian McEwan tell the inside story of the controversy, but Amis’ comments about Charles are the most frank.

Amis says: ‘I had an argument with Prince Charles at a small dinner party.

Angry: Rushdie's fatwa was issued by Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini over the publication of The Satanic Verses, which supposedly insulted the Prophet Mohammed and The Koran

‘He said - very typically, it seems to me - ‘I’m sorry, but if someone insults someone else’s deepest convictions, well then,’ blah blah blah…

‘And I said that a novel doesn’t set out to insult anyone: ‘It sets out to give pleasure to its readers,’ I told him.

‘A novel is an essentially playful undertaking, and this is an exceedingly playful novel.’

‘The Prince took it on board, but I’d suppose the next night at a different party he would have said the same thing.’

Charles’ lack of support for Rushdie comes at a time when he is under the spotlight for his supposed willingness to meddle in the affairs of others.

Some £250,000 of taxpayers’ money has been spent on legal fees trying to stop publication of letters he sent to politicians that will supposedly show he was trying to influence policy, a breach of Royal protocol.

The Vanity Fair article says that, in contrast to Charles, novelist Stephen King refused to let stores in America sell his books if they refused to carry The Satanic Verses.

He called the head of one US bookstore chain and said: ‘You don’t sell The Satanic Verses, you don’t sell Stephen King.

‘You can’t let intimidation stop books. It’s as basic as that. Books are life itself.’

During the Fatwa Rushdie lived in permanent terror and at one point thought his ex-wife Clarissa Luard and their son Zafar, who was nine at the time, had been killed by assassins or kidnapped.

'Spiritual opinion': The fatwa, or 'spiritual opinion', followed a wave of book burnings in Britain and fierce demonstrations across the Muslim world (such as this in Pakistan) which lead to the deaths of 60 people and hundreds being injured

Round-the-clock guard: Rushdie was put under round-the-clock security at the expense of the British taxpayer when a £1.2million bounty was put on his head

In 1998 Iran’s reformist president relaxed the fatwa and said it had no intention of tracking Rushdie down and killing him.

Technically it still stands but is unlikely to be enforced.

In recent years Rushdie, 66, has been more known for his relationships than his books.

He has has two children from his four marriages - his other son is called Milan - but has been linked with many other women including Indian model Riya Sen.
