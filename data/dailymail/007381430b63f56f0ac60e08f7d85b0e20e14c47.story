Canadian soldier Lawrence S Gordon

A family of a Canadian soldier killed during the Second World War believe that they may finally have found his remains after he was mistakenly buried as an unknown soldier in a German cemetery. 

Like hundreds of British Tommies and 
American GIs, Lawrence S Gordon, a Canadian who had volunteered to serve
 in France with the U.S. Army, found himself without a jacket having lost 
his own during fighting at the Battle of Normandy 69 years ago.

It is likely that he helped himself to a German military jacket from a pile of garments taken from prisoners of war who had surrendered. 

Little did he know that his 'borrowing' 
of a German battledress top would lead his family to wonder for six 
decades what ever had become of him and whether he was really alive or 
dead.

On August 13, 1944, Private First Class Gordon was killed in Normandy with another soldier in the turret of a machine gun-armored car. 

When his body was removed his dog-tag 
identification was missing but a bloodstained wallet found in his pocket helped to work out who he was. 

It was eventually sent back to his family in Canada with a letter explaining that his wallet had been found but not his body.

His family believe that because Gordon was wearing a German jacket, a mistake was made and he was 
believed to be an enemy soldier by the Allies. 

They think that his remains were 
eventually placed in a cask and interred at a German cemetery at Heines 
Sur Mer in Normandy along with the bones of 12,000 other soldiers, many unidentified. 

During the chaos in France following the D-day invasion of Normandy in 1944, supplies of uniforms were low down on 
the list of logistical priorities.

Food, guns, ammunition and medical 
supplies were paramount as hundreds of soldiers on both sides were being
 killed and wounded with each day. 

Now six decades after his death, 
Lawrence Gordon's nephews Lawrence and Sam believe they have traced his body after painstakingly
 combing through war records.

Last week, they were present along with Jed Henry, whose 
grandfather served with soldier Gordon, at the cemetery when the remains of the 'unknown German soldier' were exhumed.

The family
 now hope that by Christmas, DNA comparison tests will establish whether 
the bones are those of Lawrence S Gordon.

If the tests are positive the 
remains will be returned to Canada.

A German jacket may have been the reason for Canadian soldier Lawrence Gordon's mistaken identity

By Christmas, DNA testing should reveal if the remains belong to Gordon
