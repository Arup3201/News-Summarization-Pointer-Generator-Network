Mauro Zarate is a very different striker to Carlos Tevez but wants to make a similar impact to that of his fellow countryman at West Ham.

The 27-year-old marked his debut with a superbly struck volley in the comfortable win at Crystal Palace on Saturday, with obvious comparisons immediately struck.

Tevez’s seven crucial goals at the back end of the 2006-07 season - most notably a winner away at Manchester United - kept the Hammers in the Premier League.

Delighted: Zarate impressed on his debut for the Hammers as he scored a superb volley against Crystal Palace

Fans favourite: Despite his short stay at the club Tevez was and remains highly regarded by West Ham fans

Zarate is the sort of player, dropping off the front man, who should see that Sam Allardyce doesn’t have any such worries this year.

He was majestic when pulling the strings from deep at Selhurst Park and offered reasons to believe he is the man to bring excitement back to Upton Park - as requested by the club’s board in the summer.

‘Tevez is a star. He won everything. The Champions League with Manchester United, everything with Manchester City,’ Zarate said. 

‘I am very different. I know he was very popular with West Ham fans. I hope I can have the same impact.

‘He scored some very important goals for West Ham but I am another person, another player so I want to go step by step.’

Zarate speaks regularly with Sergio Aguero - the pair go out to dinner together - and revealed that the City striker believed West Ham was the right club for him.

Role model: Zarate is hoping to enjoy similar success to what his fellow countryman Tevez had at West Ham

Briefly a Birmingham City player in 2008, noteworthy for a sumptuous free-kick against Everton, Zarate has endured a turbulent couple of years - the low point of which was when Lazio refused to pick him following a series of very public disputes.

After a year back home in Argentina, Zarate now appears to be back - although has never scored enough goals throughout his career.

New coach Teddy Sheringham has been working alongside him in the week and was visibly delighted when Zarate flashed home the opener at Palace.

That was because the pair had rehearsed the exact scenario time and again in training.

‘He [Sheringham] has really helped me. We have been practicing volleys like that in training. From the the edge of the box - the same. He was very happy and he celebrated the goal too.’

Sheringham wasn’t the only one who looked pleased. Allardyce’s face was a picture as the goals went in as he seems to have hit upon a formula which may yield both results and pleasure in equal measure.

Asked about Zarate, Allardyce said: ‘He likes to come off and start up the top and play coming off and find spaces that none of our players are like that.

‘He’s a different kind of player to what we’ve had before. It’s very important in terms of wanting to play against a certain team and what strengths he would give you by playing against that certain team.

‘He has some strengths which other players at the club don’t have and I thought he showed that.’
