Cheick Tiote has been caught marrying a second woman in his native Ivory Coast - to the fury of his mistress.

The Newcastle United midfielder reportedly wed Laeticia Doukrou in a traditional ceremony this month, despite already being married to first wife Madah, 25.

The 28-year-old, who earns around £45,000 a week at St James' Park, lives with Madah and their two children in a £1.5million mansion in Ponteland near Newcastle.

Pictures have emerged that claim to show footballer Cheick Tiote with his second wife Laeticia Doukrou

But he also has a one-year-old child with mistress Nikki Mpofu, who was furious when she discovered he had married for a second time. 

The 33-year-old Zimbabwean ended her three-year affair with the footballer, claiming he had promised to make her his wife, reports The Sun.

She reportedly told a friend: 'He met my mum and said he's permitted to have several wives. I was comfortable with that. He's used me like a mop. He's just a pig.'

Tiote's first wife has reportedly forgiven him for marrying another woman, and his agent confirmed to the Newcastle Evening Chronicle that he had married.

Jean Musampa said: 'I can say that he did get married and that it is his second marriage. This is nothing unusual. He is a Muslim.'

Newcastle United were not available for comment.

Alan Pardew talked over the weekend of his love for Tiote, who nearly moved to Lokomotiv Moscow in the summer.

Newcastle manager Pardew said: 'I love him. He’s everything that you want in a Newcastle player.

‘He has the quality, and of course you’ll never underestimate the fact that he wants to win.

‘That’s something we have to be very careful about on training days!

‘I just love that he’s a winner. It can overcome so many obstacles as a footballer.' 

Polygamy was abolished in the Ivory Coast in 1964. Despite this, and the threat of six months to three years in prison or a fine, polygamy in west Africa is a very common practice.

It tends to be more prevalent among the animist (a form of spiritualism) and the Muslim communities.

In Senegal it was reported that nearly 47 per cent of marriages feature multiple women.

It is legal in South Africa, Egypt, Eritrea, Morocco and Malaysia. In Iran and Libya it is legal with the written consent of the first wife. In other places it is illegal but the law is rarely, if ever, enforced.

Some anthropologists believe that polygamy has been the norm throughout human history. In 2003, New Scientist magazine reported that, until 10,000 years ago, most children were fathered by a comparatively small number of men.

Polygamous marriages may not be performed in the United Kingdom, and if a polygamous marriage is performed, the already-married person may be guilty of the crime of bigamy.

Polygamous marriages legally performed in another country where the law allows it are not recognised for pension, immigration or citizenship purposes.

It is estimated that there are as many as 20,000 polygamous Muslim marriages in the UK.
