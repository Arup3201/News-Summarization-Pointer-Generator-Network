The Queen has voiced her concern about children being attracted to computer games and e-books rather than reading traditional materials.

Although it is highly unusual for the monarch to openly express an opinion on such issues, as a mother, grandmother and now great-grandmother, it is clearly a problem close to her heart.

The monarch commented as she presented author Joanne Harris with an MBE for services to literature at Buckingham Palace yesterday.

Harris, whose books have been published in more than 40 countries, came to prominence when her 1999 novel Chocolat topped the best-seller lists that year.

Speaking after today's investiture ceremony, the writer, whose books have been translated in more than 50 languages, said of her chat with the Queen: ‘She asked me what I thought about e-books and computer games and said that she feared that children were playing with those more than they were reading books.

‘So I told her that we start them on e-books and computer games and TV and then try to get them on to books later.’

She added of her MBE: ‘It's wonderful to be recognised and it's wonderful to see the world of literature be recognised every time this happens to one of us.'

Computer games and television have long been accused of distracting youngsters from reading. Posed by model

‘Books may change shape but people will always need stories, and the shape of those stories may alter.

'I think hard copy books are here to stay for a long time. The fact they're branching out into other areas doesn't feel threatening at all.’

Computer games and television have long been accused of distracting youngsters from reading.

Research by the National Literacy Trust published earlier this year found that a majority of children preferred to read on screens rather than from books but those who used the new technology had weaker literacy skills.

New research published this week also shows tablets have become a ‘must-have accessory’ for the country’s toddlers, with 50 per cent of the UK’s two and three-year-olds using one. 

A survey, by OnePoll, showed 61 per cent of three-year-olds and 38 per cent of two-year-olds play and learn on iPads.

Conducted on behalf of the children’s app range Justin’s World, it questioned 1,000 parents who have children between the ages of two and six. 

The poll  showed 4 per cent of two-year-olds have their own tablet and this doubles to 8 per cent of three-year-olds. 

By the time they are four, it more than doubles again - almost one fifth (19 per cent) of four-year-olds own their own tablet.

The majority of two-year-olds who use a tablet spend one hour a week on it, rising to one hour a day for three-year-olds.

And a third of parents think their toddler is more proficient at using a tablet than them.

The Queen’s daughter-in-law, the Duchess of Cornwall, is a great advocate of literacy in children and is patron of the charity Booktrust.

Its Chief Executive, Viv Bird, said of the Queen’s comments: ‘At Booktrust, we share the Queen’s love of the physical book, and appreciate that this is how many people choose to read, and will continue to do so.

‘We feel that the important point is that children read, rather than how they go about doing so.

‘Digital books are valuable as they offer an opportunity to engage new generations of readers - we have recently published a list of the best 100 books to read before the age of 14, many of which are now available digitally.

‘We feel that children should be given the choice. Let’s give them both of these fantastic options to pick from and get them reading.’
