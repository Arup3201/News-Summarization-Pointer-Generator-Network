Five million retired workers could be given the right to sell their private sector pensions for cash under plans being considered by ministers.

Pensions Minister Steve Webb is pushing for landmark pension reforms in last year’s Budget to be extended to those who have already retired.

Under the changes announced by George Osborne last year, savers will no longer have to use their pensions to buy an annuity – a financial product that pays an annual income until a retiree dies. Instead they will be able to cash in all or part of their savings for immediate use.

Pensions minister Steve Webb wants to let people who have already retired cash in their annuities for a lump sum

But the changes do not currently apply to existing pensioners, meaning those who have already bought an annuity will miss out on the new freedoms. The plans do not affect the state pension.

Yesterday Mr Webb, a Liberal Democrat who has been the architect of many of the Coalition’s pensions reforms, said: ‘I want to see people trusted with their own money wherever possible. I have already heard from people around the country who would like to see this change made.

‘I want to see if we can get these freedoms extended to those who are receiving an annuity, but who might prefer a cash lump sum.

‘No one would be obliged to do so, but for those who would prefer up-front capital to regular income, I can see no reason why this should not be an option.’ Under the latest plans, pensioners would be able to sell their annuities to the highest bidder, potentially unlocking tens of thousands of pounds.

Mr Webb said there was ‘considerable interest and enthusiasm’ within the pensions industry for the idea. The change is unlikely to be put in place before the election. Mr Webb said he is currently seeking cross-party agreement to get the plan implemented in the next parliament.

Critics say many annuities offer poor value for money, with pensioners offered miserly rates in return for their life savings. Pensions experts last night gave the proposal a mixed reception.

Ros Altmann, an adviser to government on older workers, said the scheme was potentially ‘workable’.

But she warned it would need a ‘radical change of mindset’, and said pensioners would have to be wary of potentially high charges when cashing in investments.

Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at Hargreaves Lansdowne, said the proposal was ‘not a bad idea in principle’, but added there were major practical difficulties, especially for those who decided they still want to buy annuities.

He said: ‘The principle of allowing people to take back control over their own money is fine and consistent with the Government’s other reforms.

‘But it takes two to tango, and even where you have a customer who wants to cash in, they still have to find an insurance company who is willing to offer them a good deal.

‘The one thing that insurance companies will not want is all the sick and ill people taking out their money, because they effectively subsidise the people who live longer.

‘So you could well be in a situation where people would have to undergo an individual underwriting process. It could be pretty challenging.’

The latest figures from the pensions industry suggest there are about six million active annuities in the UK paying out a combined total of £11billion a year.

But some people have more than one pension, and the Department for Work and Pensions estimates that about five million people in total are in receipt of annuity payments. 

Loyal savers are receiving the worst interest rates since records began, figures show.

Rates have plunged to their lowest level in 15 years, with customers now getting an average of just 1.8 per cent on fixed-term savings accounts.

Despite being among the worst-paying accounts in Britain, these have names such as Halifax’s ‘Liquid Gold’ – offering just 0.05 per cent – and Lloyds Bank’s ‘Platinum Saver’ which has a 0.1 per cent rate.

The elderly have been particularly affected by plummeting savings rates, as many rely on the interest on a nest egg to boost their pension income.

The Bank of England said the record low applied to accounts where you cannot withdraw your savings before a set date.

But accounts which allow easier access to cash are also paying near-record lows, at just 0.76 per cent on average.

The Bank of England’s base rate has been set at 0.5 per cent since March 2009, which has dragged down savings rates.

In addition, the Government’s 2012 Funding for Lending scheme allowed banks to borrow £80billion cheaply from the Bank of England, meaning they no longer needed savers to fund loans.

Sylvia Waycot, of Moneyfacts.co.uk, said many pensioners ‘have saved all their lives hoping to reap the rewards now, but they are not’.
