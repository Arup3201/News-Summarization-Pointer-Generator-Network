Iranian leader Ahmadinejad, known for past fiery denunciations of the U.S. and Israel, spoke at length about his vision for a `'new world order' during his speech at the U.N., but it was not heard by U.S. delegation, who decided 'not to attend' his speech, a blatant rejection of his controversial outbursts in recent days.

His speech Wednesday happened to fall on Yom Kippur, the most sacred day on the Jewish calendar, devoted to fasting, prayer and introspection.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement condemning the speech soon after the fast ended. `'On the day when we pray to be inscribed in the book of life a platform was given to a dictatorial regime that strives, at every opportunity, to sentence us to death,' Netanyahu said.

Addressing the nations: Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad speaks at the U.N. HQ in New York

Empty seats: Many chairs were left empty as Ahmadinejad, President of Iran, addressed the 67th session of the United Nations General Assembly Wednesday

‘In my remarks to the UN General Assembly, they will hear my response. History has proven that those who have wanted to wipe us off the map have failed, as the Jewish People have overcome all obstacles,' Netanyahu concluded.

Netanyahu has said he is going to the U.N. to draw attention to what Israel perceives as the Iranian threat. Speaking to his Cabinet on Sunday, he said at the U.N. he would 'reiterate that the most dangerous country in the world must not be allowed to arm itself with the most dangerous weapon in the world.' He did not elaborate.

Meanwhile, thousands of protesters in yellow vests emblazoned with photos of Iranian dissidents they said were killed by the Iranian regime gathered outside U.N. headquarters Wednesday during Ahmadinejad’s speech.

Speakers included former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, and former Rep. Patrick Kennedy.

In his speech on Wednesday, Ahmadinejad did not refer to Iran's nuclear program. Israel and Western nations contend that Tehran is using what it insists is a peaceful nuclear program as a cover for developing the ability to build atomic weapons.

Tough sanctions have been imposed on Iran as punishment for its failure to cooperate with the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency to prove the peaceful nature of its drive to enrich uranium to levels that could be used to build a nuclear weapon.

Israel has threatened a military strike against Iranian nuclear installations, but Obama insists there is still time to solve the dispute through diplomacy. He has vowed, however, to stop Tehran from obtaining a nuclear arsenal.

'Over the past couple of days, we've seen Mr. Ahmadinejad once again 
use his trip to the U.N. not to address the legitimate aspirations of 
the Iranian people but to instead spout paranoid theories and repulsive 
slurs against Israel,' Erin Pelton, spokeswoman for the 
U.S. Mission to the U.N., said.

'It's particularly unfortunate that Mr. Ahmadinejad will have the platform of the U.N. General Assembly on Yom Kippur, which is why the United States has decided not to attend.'

The rejection came as Ahmadinejad stepped up to the podium on Wednesday to deliver his last speech as Iranian President before the body, as he is set to leave office next June.

In his speech he accused the West of nuclear 'intimidation' and claimed Iran is under threat of military action from 'uncivilized Zionists' - in a reference to Israel - saying that such threats are designed to force nations into submission.

'Continued threat by the uncivilized Zionists to resort to military action against our great nation is a clear example of this bitter reality,' he said.

As he spoke, protesters swarmed the streets outside the UN building, many of them Iranian-Americans, demanding that Iran's UN seat be taken away.

During his stay in the U.S., Ahmadinejad has 
continued to taunt the West, calling for America to stop bullying and 
encroaching on his nation's sovereignty, in his trademark inflammatory 
style.

The Iranian leader chided the U.S. for 
its imperious antics and called the international hoopla over Iran's 
nuclear program a 'non-issue,' speaking to the Associated Press on 
Tuesday.

The Iranian leader discussed solutions for the Syrian civil war, dismissed the question of Iran's nuclear ambition and claimed that despite Western sanctions his country is better off than it was when he took office in 2005.

'God willing, a new order will come 
together and we'll do away with everything that distances us,' 
Ahmadinejad said, speaking through a translator. 'I do believe the 
system of empires has reached the end of the road. The world can no 
longer see an emperor commanding it.' 

'Now
 even elementary school kids throughout the world have understood that 
the United States government is following an international policy of 
bullying,' he said.

President Barack Obama warned Iran earlier on Tuesday that time is running out to resolve the dispute over its nuclear program.

In a speech to the General Assembly, Obama said the United States could not tolerate an Iran with atomic weapons.

Ahmadinejad would not respond 
directly to the president's remarks, saying he did not want to influence
 the U.S. presidential election in November.

But
 he argued that the international outcry over Iran's nuclear enrichment 
program was just an excuse by the West to dominate his country.

Outspoken: He accused the West of nuclear 'intimidation' but steered clear of toxic remarks about Israel

He claimed that the United States has never accepted Iran's choice of government after the 1979 Islamic revolution.

'Everyone is aware the nuclear issue 
is the imposition of the will of the United States,' he said. 'I see the
 nuclear issue as a non-issue. It has become a form of one-upmanship.'

Ahmadinejad
 said he favored more dialogue, even though negotiations with world 
powers remain stalled after three rounds of high-level meetings since 
April.

He said some world 
leaders have suggested to him that Iran would be better off holding 
nuclear talks only with the United States.

'Of
 course I am not dismissing such talks,' he said, asked if he were open 
to discussions with the winner of the American presidential election.

Israeli leaders, however, are still 
openly contemplating military action again Iranian nuclear facilities, 
dismissing diplomacy as a dead end.

Israel
 and many in the West suspect that Iran is seeking to acquire nuclear 
weapons, and cite its failure to cooperate fully with nuclear 
inspectors. Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only.

'I see the nuclear issue as a non-issue. It has become a form of one-upmanship'

 

Ahmadinejad also proposed forming a 
new group of 10 or 11 countries to work to end the 18-month Syrian civil
 war. Representatives of the nations in the Middle East and elsewhere 
would meet in New York 'very soon,' he said.

Critics have accused Tehran of giving support to Syrian President Bashar Assad in carrying out massacres and other human rights violations in an attempt to crush the uprising against his rule. Activists say nearly 30,000 people have died.

He said the so-called contact group hopes to get the Syrian government and opposition to sit across from each other.

'I will do everything in my power to create stability, peace and understanding in Syria,' Ahmadinejad said.

Earlier
 this month, Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi announced the formation 
of a four-member contact group with Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. But 
Saudi Arabia so far has not participated.

He denied Iranian involvement in plotting attacks on Israelis abroad, despite arrests and accusations by police in various countries. He also vehemently disputed the U.S. claim that Iranian agents played a role in a foiled plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the United States last year.

In the course of the interview, the leader also threw out numbers and statistics to show that Iran's economy and the lives of average Iranians have improved under his watch. 

Since his 2005 election, he claimed, Iran went from being the world's 22nd-largest economy to the 17th-largest; non-petroleum related exports increased sevenfold; and the basic production of goods has doubled. Median income increased by $4,000, he said.

'Today's conditions in Iran are 
completely different to where they were seven years ago in the economy, 
in technical achievement, in scientific know-how,' Ahmadinejad said. 
'All of these achievements, though, have been reached under conditions 
in which we were brought under heavy sanctions.'

Iran has called for the U.S. and its European allies to ease the sanctions that have hit its critical oil exports and left it blackballed from key international banking networks.

Ahmadinejad said he had no knowledge of the whereabouts of Robert Levinson, a private investigator and former FBI agent who vanished in Iran five years ago. He said he directed Iranian intelligence services two years ago to work with their counterparts in the U.S. to locate him.

'And if any help there is that I can bring to bear, I would be happy to do so,' he said.

He also claimed never to have heard of Amir Hekmati, a former U.S. Marine who is imprisoned on espionage charges in Iran. Hekmati was arrested while visiting his grandmothers in Iran in August 2011, and his family has been using Ahmadinejad's visit to New York to plead for his release.
