Celebrity gangster Dave Courtney was punched to the ground and repeatedly hit by his stepson until he said 'let's call it a draw,' a court heard today.

Mr Courtney had fallen out with Genson Courtney, 23, over plans to build a 'shack' in his back garden in case his home was repossessed.

They went to Plumstead Common, south-east London, to settle their differences but Mr Courtney came off worse, the Old Bailey was told.

Less than two weeks later Genson was shot though the eye and killed outside his girlfriend's flat.

Fight: Celebrity gangster Dave Courtney, right,Â  was punched to the ground and repeatedly hit by his stepson Genson Courtney, left, until he said: 'Let's call it a draw,' a court heard today

Prosecutors
claim he was murdered by his uncle David Pinto, 33, who had been 
threatened by Genson and wanted him 'eliminated.'

The court has heard several people had problems with the victim, who was selling drugs and robbing other dealers.

He used steroids as part of his body building routine and suffered from bouts of 'roid rage'.

Mr Courtney claimed Genson told him of his plans to rob drug dealers when they were sharing a cell in Belmarsh.

'I
know that Genson had access to firearms and he has asked me if I could 
get shotgun cartridges him,' said Mr Courtney in a statement read to the 
court.

'He was robbing drug 
dealers of the money or drugs or both. If he robbed anyone he would not 
wear a mask or cover his face. I heard he was robbing drug dealers on a 
regular basis.'

He said two weeks before Genson was shot, there was a meeting at Mr Courtney's home to discuss his financial problems.

Mr Courtney
had written books and appeared in films but his after-dinner speaking 
work was drying up and he was having difficulties paying the mortgage.

'Genson
was shouting about the house and our difficulties and I told him I was 
going to build a property to the rear of the house,' said Mr Courtney.

'We had purchased some land to the rear of our garden so if things got bad and the house was repossessed then at least we would have somewhere to live.

'Genson may have believed that due to my building skills that it would be something better than a shack and not suitable to live in.

'Genson told me to get my knuckle duster. I think now because I had told him I did not need my duster he might have thought that I was standing up to him and that I was hard enough to take him on without my knuckle duster.'

The pair went to the common at the top of the road in Genson's hired car.

Mr Courtney said: 'He came out the car and was bouncing around. I said: "You look like you want to hit me."

Location: Jonathan Rees, QC, prosecuting, said Mr Courtney was shot as he was getting into his car outside his girlfriend's flat in Banning Street, Greenwich

'I didn't think he would hit me. He was still bouncing around when he punched me in the chin.

'I went down to the ground. I said: 'F** it' and tried to get up and he hit me again. He might have hit me in total about three times.

I said to Genson: 'Hold it."

'I put both my hands up and said: "Let's call it a draw."

Mr Courtney said a few days later his son set up a meeting with Genson and they made up with a 'man hug.'

He said he saw Genson the day before he died.

'He was just himself and didn't appear to be any different and seemed to behave like nothing had happened between us,' said Mr Courtney.

The victim was getting into his car in Banning Street, Greenwich, on July 3, 2011 when the gunman shot him dead.

Pinto, of Greenwich, and his alleged accomplice Robert Bleach, 45 of Halstow Road, Greenwich, both deny murder.

The trial continues.
