Paul Merson has launched a scathing attack on Arsenal after they threw away a three goal lead to draw 3-3 with Anderlecht in the Champions League.

Speaking on Sky Sports after the match, former Arsenal midfielder Merson did not hold back in his analysis, slamming the team's overly-offensive tactics at 3-0 up. 

On 11 separate occasions he slammed the current side as 'tactically clueless' and berated the mental weakness of the Gunners players.

'If I'm being honest, I think they're tactically clueless. That's an honest opinion. How you can be 3-0 up and be attacking? This is not the first time it's happened, this happens a lot of times. It's absolutely clueless.

'The manager has got to get a message on. You're playing with international footballers. These are not little kids, they've played in World Cups, a lot of Premier League games.

'They're all bombing forward. Surely something in your head, if you know football, you say, "Right, lets stop here, lets have two banks of four, two up front, and we'll go from there. Let them break us down." As football knowledge, it's clueless, absolutely clueless.'

Arsenal went 3-0 up through goals from captain Mikel Arteta, Alexis Sanchez and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, but the Gunners could not hold on as Aleksandar Mitrovic stole a point for the away side in added time.

Arteta was also critical of his side's performance, as Arsenal slipped to five points off the top of Group D. Borussia Dortmund travel to the Emirates in the next round of fixtures, where only three points will do for the Gunners if they are to top the group.
