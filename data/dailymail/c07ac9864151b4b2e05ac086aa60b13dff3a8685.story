A mother has admitted selling her baby for sex eight times and being in the room for all but one of the meetings.

Natisha Hillard, 25, from Gary, Hammond, Indiana, met Christopher M Bour, 39, through a dating service in 2011.

A court heard they agreed to meet at her home where Bour allegedly asked her four-month-old baby daughter.

Hillard is then alleged to have accepted money from Bour for him to see the child between September 2011 and February 2013. She was present at seven of the meetings.

Charged: Natisha Hillard, 25, has pleaded guilty to selling her own baby for sex. She is alleged to have sold the child to Christopher M Bour, 39, who denies the charges

Hillard pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to one count of selling a child for sex and two counts of allowing a child to take part in child pornography.

Hillard was arrested after an acquaintance of Bour went to the FBI. The acquaintance told investigators how Bour allegedly asked her if she wanted to record him sexually touching a child.

When officers conducted a search of Bour's house, they allegedly discovered pornographic images of him with a baby with Hillard visible in the background of some of the pictures.

According to Fox News, Assistant U.S. 
Attorney Jill Koster said Hillard told police officers she agreed to 
sell the children to Bour because she needed money.

Northern District of Indiana: Charges were filed against both Hillard and Bour. He will appear before the Hammond District Court on Thursday

She said Hillard told them Bour paid her extra for the last encounter to be alone with the child.

Hillard, who is being held without bond, faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 30 years to life in prison on the count of selling a child.

Bour, also being held without bond, is charged with buying a child to produce child pornography, producing child pornography and possessing child pornography depicting a child under the age of 12, has pleaded not guilty in the case.

He has a court date scheduled for Thursday morning in U.S. District Court in Hammond.
