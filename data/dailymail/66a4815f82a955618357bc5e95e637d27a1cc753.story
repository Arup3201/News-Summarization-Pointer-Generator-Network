Television psychic Derek Acorah pleaded not guilty today when he appeared in court charged with driving offences.

The star, who shot to fame as the host of ghost-hunting TV show Most Haunted, appeared before magistrates in Sefton, Liverpool, facing accusations relating to a car crash in December.

The 63-year-old, who was charged under his real name Derek Johnson, pleaded not guilty to refusing to supply a breath sample for analysis and denied driving without due care and attention.

Police were called to a road in Southport, Merseyside, following a collision between Acorah's red Nissan GT sports car and a Ford Ka. He was not hurt in the crash.

A trial date was fixed for June 4 or 5 later this year at Sefton Magistrates Court.
