Mr Popular: U.S. President Barack Obama has 17m Twitter followers

He's one of the most well-liked global leaders in the real world.

Now, it would seem, Barack Obama has conquered the online world in the popularity stakes.

The U.S. President has been voted the most popular world leader on Twitter with 17million followers.

His unrivalled position was revealed in a new survey of how heads of government use the social networking site.

His Twitter account @BarackObama - run by his campaign staff but which also features the occasional tweet from the President himself - was responsible for the most popular post of any world leader.

On May 9 his message of 'same sex couples should be able to get married' was retweeted 62,000 times, it has been reported.

In an age of instant communication, using a Twitter account effectively is seen by politicians, in diplomacy terms, as important as a top-level phone hotline conversation.

U.S.-based PR company Burson-Marsteller looked at the accounts of 264 world leaders and government ministers to study the rise of 'Twiplomacy', The Scotsman reported.

Obama was the first major politician to harness the power of social media in his 2007 election campaign.

According to the study, his account is ranked the fifth most popular on Twitter in terms of followers, just behind U.S. pop star Britney Spears.

According to The Scotsman, Jeremy Galbraith - chief executive of 
Burson-Marsteller for Europe, the Middle East and Africa - said: 'This study illustrates how Twitter is closing the 
communication gap between us and our world leaders.

'On
the one hand, it allows heads of state and government to broadcast 
their daily activities and government news to an ever-growing audience. 
On the other hand, it allows citizens direct access to their leaders.

On message: Barack Obama's Twitter account, which is managed mainly by his campaign staff, was responsible for the most popular post of any world leader

'Consequently, it is now, more than ever, critical for these leaders to get it right on the ­social network.'

Obama's account is managed by his campaign team and the vast majority are sent by his staff, much like most government accounts.

Out of almost 5,000 tweets, just eight were signed off with the President's initials of 'B.O.' and one of these was a Valentine's Day message to his wife.

Obama's account might boast the most 
followers, but just 1 per cent of his tweets are replies indicating low 
engagement with his followers.

With more than 2million followers, British Prime Minister David Cameron came in fifth in the world leaders league.

In second place is Hugo Chavez - president of Venezuela - with more than 3million followers. Thirty-eight per cent of his tweets were replies.

Rwandan president Paul Kagame has more than 71,000 followers and 90 per cent of his tweets are replies.

The survey also revealed that 99 governments and world leader Twitter accounts have never sent a reply.

Twitter is often taken by politicians during an election campaigns but fall silent once elected, the study found.
