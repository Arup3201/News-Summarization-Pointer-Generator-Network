Officials in suburban Orlando, Florida, are searching for an ex-convict who they say is responsible for a crash this afternoon that killed a little girl inside a day care center and left 13 others injured.

Local television showed multiple people, including children, being wheeled away on stretchers Wednesday afternoon.

Small children and infants in cribs were evacuated from the building and deposited outside on the playground.

Just after 3pm on Wednesday afternoon a Dodge 
slammed into this suburban Orlando daycare and then fled the scene. More than a 
dozen people, including 12 children, were rushed to hospitals

Impact: Police say a silver or grayish Dodge crashed into a vehicle that then struck the Goldenrod Road KinderCare at North Goldenrod Road and University Boulevard in Winter Park

Chaos: The inside of the KinderCare classroom is a shambles after the car was towed out of the scene where several children were injured

Disbelief: Rescue officials say 15 people, including 11 children, were injured including Lily in the horror wreck

The Florida Highway Patrol officials say some of the victims are in 'very, very serious' condition.

In all, 12 people were hospitalized and 
two others were treated at the scene, said John Mulhall, a spokesman for
 the Orange County Fire Rescue. Six of the kids who suffered the most serious injuries were rushed to Arnold Palmer Hospital.

One person at the hospital was in critical condition and five others were in serious condition, said Katie Dagenais, a spokeswoman for Arnold Palmer. The name of the 4-year-old girl killed in the crash has not been released.

Wanted: Robert Cochardo, 28, is being sought by the Florida Highway Patrol in connection to the KinderCare hit-and-run accident

Two of the surviving victims, including a 3-year-old girl named June, were reportedly pinned under the car that slammed into the building and had to be extracted by first responders.

Children who have escaped unharmed were taken to a safe place within a portion of the building that was not affected by the collision, and officials took a roll call so they could reunite them with their parents.

Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs called the crash 'an absolute tragedy and disaster.'

Police say a silver Dodge Durango crashed into a Toyota Solara convertible, which then struck the Goldenrod Road KinderCare at North Goldenrod Road and University Boulevard in Winter Park just after 3pm.

The Durango then took off from the scene, heading into Seminole County. The Toyota driver was not hurt.

Troopers have implored the public to 
come forward if they have any information about the vehicle or its 
owner. The 2004-2006 Durango had wheelchairs in the back and would have 
front-end damage and its front bumper missing.

Just
 after 5pm, the Florida Highway Patrol announced that the SUV involved 
in the hit-and-run has been found abandoned, but the driver, identified as 
28-year-old Robert Corchado, was not yet in custody.

Authorities
 had initially believed the person of interest may attempt to flee the area by boarding
 a flight from Orlando International Airport,.

FHP
 officials said he drove to the airport, rented a Mazda CSX-1 SUV with 
the license plate CHRQ41, and then left. Anyone who sees him is being 
asked to call 911. Cochardo is considered dangerous.

Corchado has a long criminal history. Court records cited by Orlando Sentinel show he was sentenced to three years in prison in 2010 for cocaine trafficking. He was released in 2012.

Last December, the 28-year-old was arrested for heroin and cocaine possesion with intent to sell, and another hit-and-run involving property damage.

In 2004, he was arrested on charges of extortion, conspiracy and tampering with a witness. A year later, Cochardo landed in police custody once again for allegedly making threats and extortion.

The Winter Park day care center has been in operation for 25 years, catering to children between the ages of six weeks and 12 years, WESH-TV reported.
