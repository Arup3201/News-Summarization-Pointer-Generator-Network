The Metropolitan Police has received more than £5million over three years from passing on the details of traffic accidents to victims' insurance companies and lawyers, it emerged today.

It is legal for details of incidents to be given to other service providers, if they have been granted the victim's permission and act on their behalf.

This information is then used for pursue compensation claims by lawyers for the victims.

The Metropolitan Police has received more than £5million since 2009. Hampshire Constabulary has been paid more than £480,000 since 2010, and Fife Constabulary £194,000.

Accident: It is legal for accident reports to be passed on to other service providers if those firms are acting with the consent of the victim (file picture)

A Freedom of Information Act request was made by insurers LV= Liverpool Victoria, who said one in five victims reported they were encouraged to claim compensation by a police officer.

Legislation due to be implemented this April will see a ban on the payment and receipt of referral fees in personal injury cases. It will also cap lawyers' fees on successful claims.

LV= said that this legalisation has prompted a whiplash 'gold rush' and added that claims companies are now hounding people regardless of whether they have been injured or not.

One in 20 road accident victims are contacted by a claims company within two hours of a crash, a survey showed.

The research found that six per cent of victims were approached by lawyers within two hours and almost half within 24 hours.

One in four claimants said they would not have sought compensation without third party intervention. Firms are even approaching victims at the roadside and in hospital, the report found.

It said that the number of people who have been contacted following an accident has increased by 52 per cent since 2010 to two thirds of victims - despite accident rates falling.

The poll found that 13 per cent of those encouraged to make a claim were approached at the roadside, with ten per cent targeted at an information desk set up in a hospital.

LV= said that many are persistently pursued in the weeks after, with one victim reporting that he was contacted a whopping 340 times following his accident and hounded to make a claim.

Almost a third of those who made a claim admitted they exaggerated their injury to get compensation and a further one in ten said they made up the injury entirely to get the money.

John O'Roarke, managing director of LV= car insurance, said: ‘The heavy-handed tactics of the “claims farming” industry has resulted in record levels of compensation claims for whiplash and other personal injuries - despite falling accident rates.

Explanation: Scotland Yard said it did not sell details to compensation lawyers or claims management firms, and the money they were given was simply to cover their costs of providing the details

‘Crash victims are being aggressively targeted by those who can make money out of their details and they are literally hounding them to make a claim within moments of an accident.

'As would be expected, every road traffic collision is investigated by police to see whether any offences have taken place and reports are filed as appropriate'

Metropolitan Police spokesman

‘Those tempted to make a claim when they do not have an injury should think again as making a fraudulent claim could lead to a hefty fine or prison sentence.’

Scotland Yard said it did not sell any contact details to compensation lawyers or claims management firms.

The money they were given was simply to cover their costs of providing the details to firms acting on behalf of victims.

‘Every road traffic collision is investigated by police to see whether any offences have taken place and reports are filed as appropriate,’ a spokesman said.

'As is standard practice across the police service nationally, copies of these reports and associated documents are provided on request to solicitors and insurance companies acting on behalf of individuals involved in the collisions in order for insurance claims to be settled.

'This is carried out for an administrative fee.'

Forces in Fife and Hampshire also said the fees received were to cover costs.
