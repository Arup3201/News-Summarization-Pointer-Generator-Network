There was a moment after Argentina’s semi-final victory over Holland when Javier Mascherano was reminded of his match-saving challenge on Arjen Robben late in the second half.

‘I thought I had slipped, I thought I wouldn’t make it, but I tore my arse on that move, the pain . . .’ he admitted after his perfectly-executed tackle inside the area prevented the Dutch flyer from homing in on goal.

Mascherano has worked long hours in the Argentina boiler room over the years, toiling away at three World Cups in that screening role in front of the back four. Finally he has his reward. In many ways this is becoming Mascherano’s World Cup. He was in the Argentina team beaten by Germany in the 2006 quarter-final and again when Joachim Low’s team put four past them in Cape Town in 2010.

This time he is a finalist, preparing 
to lace his boots in the spacious dressing rooms of the Maracana 
alongside his gilded team-mate Lionel Messi and, injury permitting, 
Angel di Maria on Sunday.

At
 the final whistle in Sao Paulo he was overcome with emotion, in tears 
as he celebrated in front of Argentina’s supporters. ‘I know the people 
at home will be happy because two generations could not see Argentina in
 the final of a World Cup,’ said Mascherano.

‘They
 can see us there now so we are happy for that. I have spent a lot of 
time waiting for this moment.  This is my third World Cup and maybe this
 is my last one.’

What a 
journey it has been for Mascherano. Eight years ago, as West Ham 
operated in the after-glow of their FA Cup final appearance against 
Liverpool, Mascherano couldn’t get a look-in ahead of Hayden Mullins.

That was back in 2006, when Mascherano arrived at Upton Park with Carlos
 Tevez. Eight years on he is in the final, holding Argentina together in
 the centre of midfield and preparing to face Joachim Low’s expressive 
team in the Maracana. On Wednesday, Mullins signed for Notts County.

‘When
 I couldn’t play at West Ham I kept my mentality and I went to train 
every day to be a better player,’ he admitted. ‘I didn’t have the chance
 to play at West Ham, but in football you always have a chance. When I 
went to Liverpool, I had the chance to show my quality.’

Moving on: It is eight years since Mascherano arrived in the Premier League with West Ham

Onwards and upwards: The Argentinian went on to play for Liverpool and is currently at Barcelona

He
 flourished at Anfield, going on to play in the Champions League final 
in 2007 against Milan just months after his move from West Ham. This 
weekend it is the international stage again, aiming for glory in The Big
 One as Alex Sabella’s team attempt to recreate the glory of Daniel 
Passerrella in 1978 and Diego Maradona in 1986.

Argentina’s
 players watched this powerful Germany team take Brazil apart in Belo 
Horizonte on Tuesday, watching a performance of shock and awe from their
 Sao Paulo hotel.

To win 
their third World Cup, Argentina will have to break German momentum and 
prevent Toni Kroos, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Sami Khedira getting into
 their stride.

Playmaker: Bastian Schweinsteiger

That job will
 fall to Mascherano and his midfield accomplices Lucas Biglia and Enzo 
Perez. ‘Germany are formidable,’ said Mascherano.

‘They
 have technique, potential and style. They beat Brazil, but we will have
 to be concentrated and make sure they have no space. We can’t think 
about being in Brazil or that is means more because we are playing in 
Brazil. It is a World Cup and this is a chance we have dreamed of.

‘We
 have to avoid thinking about the scale of the situation. If you play 
against Germany and you leave space for them then it will be very 
difficult for us. We need to be narrow, we need to be compact. We will 
see.’

If they lose a World Cup final, the agony will go on.
