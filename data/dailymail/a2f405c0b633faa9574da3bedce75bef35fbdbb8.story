The tomb of Sir Roger Mortimer's daughter Blanche, who died in 1347, has been unearthed at a Herefordshire church

The remains of the daughter of 14th century traitor Sir Roger Mortimer are believed to have been discovered in a village church.

Sir Roger overthrew King Edward II in 1327 and reigned for three years before being overthrown by Edward’s eldest son Edward III and executed for treason aged 43.

The tomb of his daughter Blanche, who died at the age of 31 in 1347, has now been unearthed at St Bartholomew’s Church in the Herefordshire village of Much Marcle during work to restore and repair the monuments of noblemen and women buried there.

Conservator of sculpture Michael Eastham, stumbled on a lead-lined coffin, which was placed in the church 667 years ago, in October last year during the £500,000 restoration project.

Mr Eastham has been working on the Grandison Memorial in the church for nearly two years but was taken aback when he discovered a coffin jammed inside the tomb-chest.

The tomb is crowned by an effigy of Blanche and is regarded as one of the finest in the country.

Historians have always believed the bodies of those being honoured by the memorials were buried deep underground and the monuments themselves were either empty or filled with rubble to support the ornate effigies carved in stone on top.

Mr Eastham said: 'We could not work out what it was when we first took the stone panels from the front of the memorial.

'We thought it might be a layer of slate but as we explored further we realised it was a lead coffin.

'It’s the first time in more than 30 years as a conservator that this has ever happened.'

The remains underwent an endoscopic examination.

The Reverend Howard Mayell, vicar for the
 parish, added: 'We kept the discovery under wraps until we had carried 
out tests and made her secure again.

'There wasn’t much left in the coffin, so we can’t be absolutely certain it is Blanche but we believe the remains are hers.

'We are quite overwhelmed by the idea Blanche is still in the church.'

A spokeswoman for the Diocese of Hereford said: 'There are thousands of these monuments in churches around Britain.

'Historians have always believed these
 monuments are in fact empty and the bodies of the people they are 
dedicated to are buried nearby or under the church.

'This
 discovery challenges that long held view and it could mean that 
hundreds more monuments actually do contain the remains of people buried
 hundreds of years ago.'

Blanche’s
 tomb, which is located within the chancel, includes an effigy which has
 been described by experts as 'strikingly beautiful'.

A spokesman for English Heritage said: 'It is astonishing to find a coffin within a tomb. Usually the tomb chest is empty, with the body buried beneath.

'The coffin is complete, irregular in shape like a lead shroud, and has a number of small holes in it.

'The decision was eventually taken that the coffin should not be opened, both on grounds of best archaeological practice and the Church of England policy that human remains should be disturbed as little as possible.'

Blanche was the wife of Sir Peter Grandison and despite her father’s infamy she was wealthy and considered the lady of the manor until her death.

He husband’s tomb lies in Hereford Cathedral.

Sir Roger Mortimer was the 1st Earl of March who was the second cousin twice removed of Edward II.

He amassed fortune after gaining many estates in the Welsh Marches in Ireland following his marriage to wealthy heiress Joan de Geneville, 2nd Baroness Geneville.

In November 1316 he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland but was imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1322 for leading the lords in a revolt against King Edward II in what became known as the Despenser War.

He escaped to France where he was joined by Edward’s queen consort Isabella, who he took as his mistress.

He and Isabella invaded England and successfully overthrew Edward II before being the country’s de factor ruler for three years.

In 1330 Edward’s son overthrew him and he was famously executed by hanging at Tyburn in London.

History has often referred to Sir Roger as ‘The Greatest Traitor’ on account of his repeated rebellions against the monarchy.

Sir Roger Mortimer, the 1st Earl of March, was an English nobleman who was imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1322 after leading a revolt against King Edward II.

He escaped to France where he took Edward's queen consort Isabella as his mistress before returning to England to depose the king in 1327.

Mortimer (below, with Isabella) is also alleged to have arranged the king's murder at Berkely Castle.

He was de facto ruler of England for three years before Edward's eldest son Edward III overthrew him.

He was executed for treason at the age of 43.
