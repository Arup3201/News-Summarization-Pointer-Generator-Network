A former bank worker tried to slash his topless masseuse girlfriend's throat in a jealous rage after another man smiled at her in a salsa club, a court heard.

Amish Kansagra, 28, turned up at the home of  Anna Imporowicz, in Brentford, west London, with a knife from the massage parlour they ran together the day after they rowed in the club.

Kingston-upon-Thames Crown Court was told he held the knife to her throat saying 'you've made the wrong decision. You will die today.'

Anna Imporowicz (arriving at court, left, and in modelling shot, right), a topless masseuse, told a court that her ex-boyfriend, Amish Kansagra, tried to stab her after they had a row in a salsa club when a man smiled at her

The pair began dating when Kansagra became a regular client of Ms Imporowicz, 35, who massaged her naked customers while either topless or wearing skimpy underwear.

Kansagra quit his bank job and opened a new massage business in Ealing, west London, with Ms Imporowicz, originally from Warsaw in Poland. 

The court heard their 'happy relationship' ended the day before the stabbing after a man smiled at her in a Holborn salsa club in central London.

Prosecutor Julian Jones said: 'When they got home he was shouting that Anna was a whore and Amish grabbed her phone and laptop and destroyed them.'

He then allegedly shoved her against a fridge and the stairs before leaving and it is suggested he posted a skimpy-clothed image of her on Facebook with the caption: 'I'm a prostitute and proud of it.'

They agreed to meet the next day on June 22 last year, but Kansagra had already armed himself with a 'big knife' he took from the massage parlour, the court heard.

Mr Jones added: 'She saw Amish with the  knife in his hand and he shut the kitchen window and put the knife to her throat and said: "You've made the wrong decision. You will die today".

'He was trying to stab her neck and she felt him cut her neck and and she saw her blood and fell to the floor saying: "I love you. Don't do this".

'She described him as having gritted teeth and eyes "Like the devil" and he cut her neck again, harder and deeper, and used the tip of the knife to cut her gum.'

Ms Imporowicz allegedly tried to flee out of the front door, but was pulled back by the defendant.

'He still had the knife in one hand and the other hand around her neck and stabbed her in the side,' Mr Jones added.

'She escaped via a window and while she had one leg out Amish tried to stab her everywhere.'

A passer-by, who so happened to be a retired nurse, came to her aid and as Kansagra fled the bloody scene he told passers-by his girlfriend had inflicted the injuries on herself, the court heard. 

'The prosecution say this was a clear cut case of attempted murder, an intention to kill,' he said.

Kansagra slept rough and travelled to Manchester and back, eventually giving himself up at Shoreditch Police Station, initially claiming he remembered nothing due to a three-day vodka binge, the court heard.

'He said she was the first person he had ever loved and that there was something inside him. 

'He recalled stabbing Anna in the neck and seeing the blood and confirmed he was not acting in self-defence.'  

The jury also heard Kansagra flew into a jealous rage at a party the previous New Year's Eve and caused a scene when a guest became too friendly with Ms Imporowicz.

'A guy dropped a cocktail stick down her cleavage and later squeezed her bottom and Amish started swearing and scratched the man's nose,' said Mr Jones.

Ms Imporowicz explained to the jury she first met Kansagra through her work.

'It was sensual massage and the masseuse would maybe be in her underwear or without a bra and the client would be without their underwear,' she said.

'It ends with hand relief,' she added, insisting sexual intercourse would not take place.

Kansagra has pleaded not guilty to one count of attempted murder and two counts of assault, but has already admitted causing criminal damage, possessing a bladed article and inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent.

The trial continues.
