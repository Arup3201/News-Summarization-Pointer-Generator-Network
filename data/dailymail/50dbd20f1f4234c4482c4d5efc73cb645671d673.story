Foreign aid funds must be diverted to help flood-stricken areas, MPs said last night.

With appalling weather set to deepen the crisis in the West Country, politicians of all stripes called for a raid on the £11billion overseas development budget.

They said instead of sending the money to increasingly rich countries such as China and India, charity should begin at home.

‘We send money all over the world, now we need to give people down here the hope that they will get what they need,’ said Ian Liddell-Grainger, Tory MP for flood-hit Bridgwater in Somerset.

The Prime Minister vowed today that the Government will do 'everything that can be done' to help those affected by the floods

Mr Cameron, who arrived by helicopter, said the flooding was 'biblical' as he surveyed knee-deep water surrounding the farm

Speaking from the flood-affected village of 
Stoke St Gregory, Lord Smith (left) said he had no intention of 
resigning. Mr Liddell-Grainger (right) said Lord Smith visited the area a
 year ago and 'promised he would have this sorted within six months'

‘We should divert some of it down here. We don’t have to divert it for ever, but we need it now.’

The calls came as:

The floodwater surrounding Tewksbury continues to remain following heavy rainfall in the area

Severe flooding in Essex yesterday meant ten people two dogs had to be rescued by Essex Fire by boat in Saffron Walden

Soldiers from Carver Barracks  had to put out sandbags to try and protect buildings in Saffron Walden, Essex, from the severe floods

There's more on the way: Winds of 80mph and heavy rain will sweep in from the Atlantic tomorrow, in what forecasters say could be the worst of the dramatic weather so far this winter

Billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money has poured abroad to help those affected by flooding.

The Government has set up the International Climate Fund, which will give £3.87billion over five years to help developing countries ‘mitigate and adapt to climate change’.

In contrast, dredging the Somerset Levels would cost £4.5million.

Britain has given nearly £1.2million to the World Bank’s flood prevention and control scheme, and spent £941,000 on its ‘site preservation’ work.British taxpayers contributed a further £986,000 on protecting the biosphere in developing countries.

A further £115million has been spent on preventing floods and other disasters in developing countries. The Government has also donated millions for disaster recovery following particular floods abroad, including £42.5million to aid agencies in Pakistan following floods in 2011.

The Department for International Development earmarked £75million for the Bangladesh climate change programme in 2008.

When Mozambique was hit by floods in 2000, the Labour government gave £12million extra in aid and dispatched Royal Navy Sea-King helicopters to deliver aid in relief camps.

A C-17 military plane was sent to Colombia when it was hit by floods in 2011, carrying 400 aid boxes.

The International Climate Fund has spent nearly £80million helping Indonesia, Ghana and others tackle deforestation problems.

It has also sent £4.3million to countries such as Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique and Niger to help them study weather forecasts better and adapt to the impacts of climate change.

The Prime Minister has pledged Britain will spend 0.7 per cent of national income on overseas aid –  a promise that means the money funnelled abroad will rise from £8billion to £12billion between 2010 and 2015.

By contrast, dredging the Somerset Levels, which might have prevented the disaster, would cost only £4.5million.

But while the Environment Agency let drainage channels fall into disrepair, Britain has funnelled £1.2million into the World Bank’s flood prevention programme.

It has also sent another £115million to disaster prevention schemes in poor countries.

Millions more have also been spent in the cases of individual countries hit by flooding.

This includes £42.5million for  Pakistan in 2011, £12million to Mozambique in 2000 and £75million in Bangladesh in 2008.

The Department for the Environment has also given £140million to an international climate fund destined for developing countries, which also aims in part to prevent flooding.

Surrounded: The flooded Somerset Levels, where hamlets have been turned into 'ghost villages' after homes were evacuated due to rising flood waters, is expecting a new deluge of torrential rain

Neil Parish, Tory MP for Tiverton and 
Honiton in Devon, said: ‘We’ve got to make sure we look after our own at
 this stage.  Foreign aid is good, but it  is wasted.

‘We
 need to make sure that money comes straight to the West Country. We’ve 
got to rebuild coastal defences and railways.’ Jacob Rees-Mogg, Tory MP 
for North East Somerset, said: ‘Overseas aid should be a matter for 
private charity, rather than taxpayers’ money.

‘The failure of the Environment Agency to dredge the Somerset levels means there is a lot of work to do.’

Labour and Lib Dem MPs also suggested the aid budget should be reconsidered in the light of the crisis.

Former
 Labour minister Frank Field said the Government should examine what 
flood prevention schemes it funded abroad, look at ‘which ones worked, 
and divert some of that money to flood prevention and relief at home’.

He added: ‘We could then ensure our money is better spent abroad and at home, creating two virtuous circles.’

Drafted in: Royal Marines who had been in the region building sandbag defences were drafted in to assist with the evacuation of residents in the village of Moorland this morning

Building defences: Royal Marines  build flood defences in Moorland on the Somerset Levels following serious flooding

Worked through the night: Lieutenant Brendan Ford, of the Royal Navy 40 Commando Royal Marines, said two units had worked through the night to boost flood defences

And
 Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming said: ‘If we are not capable of 
properly dealing with domestic natural disasters, we should rethink our 
financial strategy – including questioning increasing the aid budget.’

Mr Liddell-Grainger said that if the British Government didn’t help out,
 locals would have to ask foreign countries for assistance from their 
aid budgets.

He said: ‘We 
need to go and ask Abyssinia for some cash. I’m sure they’ll be happy to
 help us because this money is not made available to our own people.

‘It’s
 really bad down here. We’ve got people doing amazing things to clean 
up. But we need pumps and sluice gates and we’ve got to rebuild railway 
lines.’ Ukip leader Nigel Farage first suggested that aid money should 
be diverted to the West Country.

He
 said: ‘Anyone with an ounce of common sense knows that a government’s 
primary duty is to the well-being of its own citizens. Charity begins at
 home and it is not mean-spirited to say that, it is just basic common 
sense.’

Damage caused: Flooded areas and sea defences weakened by earlier storms will be bombarded once more. Pictured is a flooded home in Moorland

Storm waning: The flooded Somerset Levels is expecting a new deluge of torrential rain as the Atlantic storm sweeps in this weekend

Rescue: A vehicle drives through the flooded village of Moorland after it was evacuated following severe flooding over night

Help at hand: Emergency services and Marines move in to help people evacuate in Moorland, Somerset, after flood waters rose dramatically over night

During his visit the Prime Minister disputed the idea that more money would help.

‘The
 resources are there, the money is there,’ he told residents at a 
flooded farm near Bridgwater. ‘It’s a biblical scene. People here have 
faced a very tough time and continue to face a tough time and that’s why
 we have got to do everything we can to help.

‘We
 brought in more pumps, more help from the emergency services, money to 
help Somerset get back on its feet, the money is there.

‘I’ve
 said when the water levels come down and it’s safe to dredge, we will 
be dredging to make sure these rivers can carry a better capacity of 
water – there are lessons to be learned.’

Transport: Flood-hit travellers in south west England are to get more flights and coach services and special rail fare offers to help them cope with transport difficulties. Pictured is damage to the Dawlish line

Assistance: The announcement of assistance came as Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin visited Dawlish in Devon where the rail has been wrecked by the severe storms

Arrangements: The Department for Transport has said First Great Western has put in place special ticketing arrangements so rail passengers who are affected by flood disruption do not miss out on cheaper advance fares while revised timetables are put in place
