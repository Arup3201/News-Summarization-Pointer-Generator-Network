Anger: David and Rosemary Wickenden were appalled by the blunder after their grandson's death

A couple who raised their grandson have been offered child support money almost two decades after they applied - and 18 months after he took his own life.

Blundering Child Maintenance Service staff wrote to David and Rosemary Wickenden to say Mitchell, who they took in aged eight in 1995, would finally start receiving cash.

But the boy, who had grown up, joined the Army and served in Iraq, hanged himself aged 25 after suffering from depression.

The couple from Southampton took in Mitchell and raised him as their own after his parents split up.

Mr Wickenden, 74, said: 'We did all the legwork for child support years ago but never got anywhere, so this just shows what a mess they can make of it.

'If he was still alive Mitchell would be 27, so how can something like this happen?

'At the time we were told we could not claim off our son Paul because he was out of work.

'We got some money from their mother but it ended quickly.

'Then we got this letter and I was just amazed... We were only just beginning to get over our grief.

'It’s pure carelessness and I think we deserve an apology.'

Mitchell,
 a former soldier with the 1st Battalion, Princess of Wales’s Royal 
Regiment, was found hanged at his Southampton home in October 2012 after
 a break-up and losing his job.

The Southampton FC fan was 18 when he 
was sent on a six-month tour of duty in Iraq in 2006, but he was later 
discharged from the Army on medical grounds.

An
 inquest heard he had become depressed after splitting up 
with his girlfriend and losing his job at a local removal firm.

It also heard his experiences in Iraq may have contributed to his suicide.

Mrs Wickenden, 71, said: 'What if a mother whose young child had died had received something like this?'

The couple said they spent more than an hour on the phone to the CMS trying to get answers, but to no avail.

The grandparents, who also took in granddaughter Sadie at the same time as Mitchell, had demanded an apology.

Mrs Wickenden, 71, said: 'What if a mother whose young child had died had received something like this?

'We want to make sure this never happens again.'

A Child Maintenance Service spokesman said: 'Unfortunately a letter was sent to Mr and Mrs Wickenden in error and we apologise for the obvious distress this has caused.

'We are urgently investigating how this has happened and will be in touch with the family shortly.'
