A father has been jailed for beating his mentally ill wife to death with a flashlight after she strangled their son and tried to kill their daughter.

Christopher Smeltzer, 39, of New Hampshire, was jailed for up to 30 years after pleading guilty to killing Mara Pappalardo in November 2010.

She was paranoid, obsessed with death and convinced her husband and mother-in-law were plotting to take her children away, a court heard.

Sentenced: Christopher Smeltzer, 39, has been jailed for beating his mentally ill wife Mara Pappalardo to death after she killed Mason and tried to kill Mercey

Pappalardo was hospitalised for mental illness before she strangled their four-year-old son with a ribbon and tried to kill their seven-year-old girl.

Smeltzer’s charge was changed from second-degree manslaughter to manslaughter by provocation because of a horrific scene he encountered.

He found his son strangled, his daughter dangling off a bed with a scarf around her neck and his wife trying to commit suicide, prosecutors said.

‘As soon as I saw my son I knew something was very wrong,’ Smeltzer said. ‘I knew he was dead and I lost all control. Enraged, I struck my wife.

‘I did something that was not going to bring my son back,’ adding that he wished he had a ‘rewind button’ to go back and change what he did.

Smeltzer believed his daughter was dead as well and toxicology tests confirmed he took a large quantity of pills in an effort to take his own life.

His daughter Mercey awakened him the next morning and asked if her mother and brother were still breathing, prosecutors said.

Mercey wanted her father to make her some
tea and had told investigators her father removed the scarf from her 
neck, the court heard.

A tape recording of Mercey reading a letter to the judge was played by her lawyer, because the girl did not attend the hearing.

‘I am mad and sad that my Daddy killed my Mommy and brother Mason,’ she said. ‘Please keep him in jail for the rest of his life.’

‘Mercey is an innocent victim of Chris's actions as well as Mara's,' John Newman, defending, said. 'Chris is painfully aware his actions were wrong.'

Smeltzer picked up his dead son, put his mouth to his son's mouth and found it was ice cold, Mr Newman told the court.

The sentencing took place in a 
Rockingham Superior court. There was tension between members of 
Smeltzer's family and his wife's.

At one point during the 90-minute 
sentencing, a member of her family shouted to Smeltzer that God will be 
the judge of his actions.

Pappalardo’s cousin Adam Roz faulted Smeltzer for leaving his wife alone with the children and said he failed as a father, husband and human being.

‘In my heart, I feel anyone sitting here today should have, could have, but just plain didn't act,’ Mr Roz said. ‘For that, we're all guilty of this tragedy.’

Pappaladro's sisters spoke of her passion for nature and reading and dreams of writing children's books.

‘She believed in God, the saints, the power of prayer and love and even in magic,’ her sister, Mona Harris, said.

Judge Tina Nadeau questioned whether the outcome would have been the same had Smeltzer not used drugs that night.

'In my heart, I feel anyone sitting here today should have, could have, but just plain didn't act. For that, we're all guilty of this tragedy'

But she acknowledged that he must have had an extreme emotional reaction to what greeted him when he came home.

She said nothing she could do or say would lessen the grief for the families and imposed the sentence the state requested.

It included a provision that five years will be suspended if he earns his college degree and takes anger management classes.

With the suspension and credit for time served since his arrest, he could be free in nine years. Mercey now lives with one of her mother's sisters.
