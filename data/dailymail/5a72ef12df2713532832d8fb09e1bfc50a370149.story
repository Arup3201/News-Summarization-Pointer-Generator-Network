Smartphones really are addictive and the more you use one, the worse it gets, a new study has revealed.

Moodiness, loneliness and jealousy are all key indicators of smartphone addiction, along with an obsession with physical appearance, the University of Derby study found.

Psychology lecturer, Dr Zaheer Hussain, who co-authored the study, found that the more you use a smartphone, the higher your risk of becoming addicted.

A Study by University of Derby says 13 per cent of us are addicted, and the average user spends 3.6 hours a day on their smartphone (stock image shown). Moodiness, loneliness and jealousy are all key indicators of addiction. An obsession with physical appearance is also a telling sign

He explained that higher scores of narcissism - defined as excessive interest or admiration of oneself and one’s physical appearance - is the most common and obvious sign of the addiction.

An obsession with taking selfies and posting them on social media is one key indication.

‘A significant positive relationship was found between narcissism and addiction to the phones, suggesting that the more narcissistic a person is, the more likely they are to be addicted to their smartphone,’ he said.

In a move that might seem counter-intuitive, a Berlin-based psychologist has developed an app to help wean us off our gadgets.

Called Offtime, it limits which apps can be used to avoid distractions, or prevents people from contacting you unless in an emergency.

It doesn’t limit connectivity permanently; instead, users can enable Offtime mode for any time when they need to focus, or at set times during the day.

And there are various levels of customisation.

For example, all calls, texts and notifications can be blocked during Offtime.

Alternatively, users can pre-select so-called VIP contacts that are never blocked, and can get hold of the phone owner even when Offtime is enabled. 

The study found that 13 per cent of 256 participants were addicts. The average age of those who took part in the online survey was 29.

As a result, the researchers say they believe it should be made compulsory that anyone selling smartphones should warn customers of their potentially addictive properties.

Dr Hussain said: ‘The study informs us about smartphone overuse and the impact on psychological well-being.

'We now use smartphones on a daily basis and for various tasks so being aware of the psychological effects is very important.

‘There are various smartphone apps such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Candy Crush, as well as Skype and email that make smartphone use psychologically more attractive and can lead to addiction.’

The study also revealed the average user spent 3.6 hours per day on the device, and when the participants were asked if they used their phone in banned areas, 35 per cent answered yes.

Social networking sites were the most popularly used apps - 87 per cent - followed by instant messaging apps - 52 per cent - and then news apps - 51 per cent.

Relationships were also noted in the research as, despite 46.8 per cent of participants speaking positively of improved social relations, nearly a quarter admitted their smartphones create communication issues within ‘real life’.

A study in 2011 found more than half of adults and two thirds of teenagers said they have used their smartphone while socialising with others (stock image shown). Nearly a quarter of adults and a third of teenagers have also used them during mealtimes, according to the study

Professor James Elander, Head of the Centre for Psychological Research at the University of Derby, said: ‘This study is a very timely one with much potential impact, and the findings show that users should be more aware of how they are using their smartphones and of the potential risks of excessive use.

A study in 2011 found more than half of adults and two thirds of teenagers said they have used their smartphone while socialising with others.

Nearly a quarter of adults and a third of teenagers have used them during mealtimes and over a fifth of adults admitted using or answering their handset in the bathroom.

The research found that the line between work and social time is also becoming increasingly blurred with 30 per cent of smartphone users saying they regularly take personal calls during working hours and work calls while they are on holiday.

In 2013, John Benson from Blackpool said his addiction to his smartphone led to him losing his job and relationship. His therapist, Steve Pope, said for some of his patients smartphones are ‘as addictive as cocaine or any other drug.’

The research paper, titled: ‘Smartphone Use, Addiction, Narcissism, and Personality: A Mixed Methods Investigation’ has recently been published in the International Journal of Cyber Behaviour, Psychology and Learning (IJCBPL).
