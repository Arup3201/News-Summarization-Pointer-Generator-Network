An octogenarian  has brought smiles to her loved ones' faces from beyond the grave by joking in her obituary that she passed away while climbing Mount Kilimanjaro.

Norma Brewer, 83, who penned her own death notice before she passed away on January 27, wrote that she likely died from hypothermia after her dog, Mia, ate her socks and boots.

'Norma Rae Flicker Brewer, a resident of Fairfield, passed away while climbing Mount Kilimanjaro,' read the obituary, which was published in the Connecticut Post.

'One last joke with the world': Norma Brewer, 83, passed away following a stroke last week - but in her obituary she claimed she died at the base came of Mount Kilimanjaro surrounded by her daughter, her dog and cats

'She never realized her life goal of reaching the summit, but made it to the base camp. Her daughter, Donna, her dog, Mia, and her cats, came along at the last minute. There is suspicion that Mrs. Brewer died from hypothermia, after Mia ate Mrs. Brewer's warm winter boots and socks.'

Brewer, who wrote the obituary 11 years ago with a friend, actually passed away after a stroke.

Her loved ones said the piece was 'typical' Norma.

'She always had stories, many of which were not true, but thought were funny,' her daughter, Donna Brewer, told the Connecticut Post. 

'People who don't know my mother are bemused. People who know my mother are laughing and saying, "Yeah, that's Norma".' 

Loved: Brewer, pictured in her younger years, had a joyous outlook on life, her children said

Remembered: She penned her own obituary 11 years ago and it was printed in the Connecticut Post

The obituary also explains how Brewer, who was the daughter of local newspaper president W. Raymond Flicker, graduated from Marymount College in New York in 1953 before moving throughout the area and having children. 

Norma Brewers son, Raymond, added that the humorous obituary summed up the way his mother viewed the world: 'While life is serious, it shouldn't be taken all that serious.'

'It was her way of having one last joke with the world,' he said.

As well as Donna and Raymond, she leaves behind a sister, three sons and six grandchildren.
