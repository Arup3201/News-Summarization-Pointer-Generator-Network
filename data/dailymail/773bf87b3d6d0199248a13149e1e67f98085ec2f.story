A group of award-winning gardeners have been ordered to remove decorative flowerpots from their pathways amid health and safety fears that they are an 'obstruction'.

Green-fingered residents of Rialto Gardens sheltered housing in Higher Broughton, Salford, Greater Manchester, have spent the last five years decorating their neighbourhood with a range of flowers including fuchsias, lilies and begonias.

And for the past two years they have won second prize for the best communal garden category of a Summer Bloom competition – which is run by social housing provider Salix Homes.

However, they have now been asked by Salix to remove around 20 flowerpots and tubs lining a communal footpath next to their homes over complaints about them causing an 'obstruction'.

Social housing provider Salix Homes has told residents the flowerpots are causing 'obstruction' to the path

The angry residents claim they flowerpots are not causing an obstruction or hazard and are simply there to brighten the neighbourhood, which they have done so for the last five years since the group took up gardening

Pensioner Valerie Webb said: 'They have never caused an obstruction or an accident. They are only on one side of the railings but we have been told that they are a trip hazard.

'I feel really depressed about this because my gardening is all that I've got. No gardening, no Val.'

The 62-year-old added: 'We do it to cheer ourselves up but we won't bother next year.'

In a letter to residents, customer support manager Helen Thorpe said: 'While we appreciate that a lot of work has been put in by some of the residents, including you, into the gardens and that this as recognised by the recent award made in the garden competition, we do have to ask that any communal paths or walkways on the scheme are kept clear.'

The social housing provider sent this letter to residents asking them to keep paths and walkways clear

Pensioner Valerie Webb, who takes pride in her plants, blasted the letter and said: 'I feel really depressed about this because my gardening is all that I've got. We do it to cheer ourselves up but won't bother next year'

Salix Homes chief executive Sue Sutton added: 'We appreciate the efforts of all the residents at Rialto Gardens who take such pride in the area and work so hard to keep the communal area looking so pleasant and welcoming.

'However, there are a number of residents in the area who suffer from mobility issues. We have a duty to ensure that the footpaths are clear and accessible at all times.

'We have asked the residents involved to move their tubs into their own gardens or onto a grassed area off the path and we are working very closely with the residents to resolve this issue.'
