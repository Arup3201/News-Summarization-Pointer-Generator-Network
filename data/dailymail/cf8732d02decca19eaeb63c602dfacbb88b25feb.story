The Turkish gardener who gunned down his British lover felt ‘humiliated’ after she failed to acknowledge their relationship in front of her family.

Anne Bury was shot dead at point-blank range by Velli Acar hours after she celebrated her 56th birthday.

Despite their relationship being over, Acar, 46, had turned up at her luxury villa while she was celebrating with her son and elderly mother.

Her son asked: ‘Why is the gardener here?’, prompting Acar and Miss Bury to have a row over her failure to tell her family they were a couple.

He left but returned hours later, drunk and with a pump-action shotgun, with which he shot Miss Bury with four times.

Her
 only son Alex, 24, and mother Cecilia, 87, were also shot but survived 
their injuries. Acar then handed himself in saying: ‘I killed my love 
and now I am finished.’

In a
 police statement, Acar said he was angry with Miss Bury for repeatedly 
embarrassing him, adding: ‘She kept on humiliating me. I lost control 
and killed her.’

The 
qualified midwife had been having an affair with Acar, whom she employed
 as a gardener at her holiday home in the Turkish resort of Dalyan, for 
six years.

But Miss Bury, from Swainby, North Yorkshire, ended it after he racked up vast debts.

Acar’s
 parents, Dursan, 77, and Muzeyyen, 66, said they viewed Miss Bury as a 
daughter but knew her family were in the dark over the relationship.

Mr Acar said: ‘This year Anne’s son came. He did not know about the relationship – he thought he was the gardener.’

Gardener Velli Acar's father Dursun spoke of his son's obsession with murdered mum Anne Bury, 56 (pictured left). Velli Acar, 46, was arrested Monday after the shooting

Openly 
sobbing as they spoke outside their bungalow in the tiny fishing village
 of Dalyan, Velli Acar's dad Dursun said: 'It was like a crazy love. He 
was completely obsessed with her.'

And
 to prove their point Acar's distraught parents showed reporters six 
poster-sized copies of the same picture of Anne and Acar that 
decorated the walls of their village home.

'These pictures prove how much he loved her,' said his dad Dursun.

Adding:
 'He loved her so very much. She was his world. But we loved Catherine 
too. We are so sad about this situation. We never thought he would do 
something like this.'

And
 Velli's elderly mum, Muzeyyen, said: 'Catherine also loved Velli so 
much. She treated us like her family. She was very affectionate and 
would always hug and kiss us. She showed us respect and would greet us 
in Turkish. I'm devastated.'

Acar, 46, also shot her 24-year-old son Alex and mum Cecilia, 87, who both survived, with a pump action 
shotgun at their luxury villa on Monday.

But
 his Muzeyyen insisted Acar was not just a gardener to the Bury family. 
'He wasn't the gardener. They lived together as husband and wife,' she 
said.

'He's a very sweet and gentle boy. We enjoyed a glass of Raki together and would chat until the early hours,' said Dursun.

Acar's parents said they had only seen their son briefly since the shooting.

'We were allowed five minutes with him at the jandarma station - we were all in tears,' said Muzeyyen.

'We still have absolutely no idea why this happened. It's destroyed both our families. Anne's dead, Velli's gone and we are left with broken hearts and no answers.'

Acar, 46, was arrested on Monday after he blasted Anne, her son Alex and mum Cecilia with a pump action shotgun at their luxury villa.

He's been remanded in custody pending the outcome of a police investigation.
