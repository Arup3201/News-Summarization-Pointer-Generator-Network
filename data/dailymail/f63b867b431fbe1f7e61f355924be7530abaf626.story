Actress Sarah Lancashire has dealt the BBC a blow by quitting her widely praised role in period drama The Paradise.

The 48-year-old will leave halfway through the second series, which begins its run next month.

The  mother of three blames a filming clash with her other BBC series, Last Tango In Halifax, for her decision.

Popular: Lancashire was a hit with viewers in the role of Miss Audrey, the snobbish head of the Ladieswear department in a Victorian department store

The Paradise follows the lives of staff at a Victorian department store. Lancashire plays Miss Audrey, the head of ladieswear.

Her snobbish approach to her work and colleagues provided much of the first series’ comic moments – with one critic praising her ‘deliciously subtle study of a middle-aged spinster petrified that life is passing her by’.

Last night the actress, who is married to BBC executive Peter Salmon, said: ‘I’m very sad to go but unfortunately it was a decision that I had to take as the filming schedule clashed with Last Tango In Halifax and I couldn’t do both.’

The Paradise pulled in almost six million viewers when it was screened last year but received mixed reviews. Many critics felt it lacked the dramatic impact of its ITV rival Mr Selfridge.

Gong: The actress is leaving to return to play a headmistress called Caroline in the BBC's Last Tango in Halifax, a role which earned her a Bafta nomination last year

By contrast, Last Tango In Halifax, 
which also stars Derek Jacobi and Anne Reid, was a surprise hit  and 
Lancashire was nominated for a Bafta for her role as headmistress 
Caroline.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘Due to a clash with commitments, it was agreed that Miss Audrey would only appear in a couple of episodes. 

‘However, the door is very much open for her return.’
