 Two weeks after his Presidential ambitions sank without trace Mitt Romney is moving to California and there are certanly worse places for a former candidate to wash up.

Where money meets the sea: Romney's $12million beachfront home in La Jolla, San Diego and the place where he and Ann intend to move...though they have big plans for the place.

Life's a beach: Mitt and Ann Romney show no signs of missing the trappings and pressures of the presidential campaign

Romney, 65, and his wife Ann have spoken of plans to move to their home in La Jolla, San Diego - an area known locally as the place 'where money meets the sea'.

The couple paid $12million cash for their Mediterranean style home in San Diego's 'jewel' four years ago. 

And after so many months of teetering on the fiscal cliff it is easy to see why, for Romney, a move to his La Jolla bolthole with its 61 feet of beach frontage appeals.

Though, described by one political commentator, as 'an active' man it seems unlikely that Romney will simply pull up a sun-lounger and put up his feet.

The couple reportedly have plans to demolish the villa as it now stands and replace it with a sprawling home twice the size.

The location also has a stong draw for the devout Mormon as La Jolla is home to the San Diego Mormon Temple. The vast twin-steepled building to which Romney is believed to have contributed financially,  covers 72,000square feet of this stretch of San Diego.

Having a whale of a time: Romney enjoys Thunder Mountain on Tuesday. If he's missing politics it certainly isn't showing

Romney never was a career politician. The gladhanding and electioneering never came easy to the former Massachusetts governor.

Perhaps that is why, in the days since the 2012 nominee conceded he has shown no signs of missing the trappings of the power that hoevered, so briefly, within his grasp.

Stipped of the 24 hour security detail, the cavalcade of cars, the assistants, campaign managers, make-up artists and stylists Romney has relaxed with his family.

Two weeks to the day since losing the 
election, he visited Disneyland with his wife and grandchildren and evidently had a whale of a time.

The former Republican nominee has also been 
seen out with his wife catching the latest installment of the Twilight 
saga in Del Mar, California.

Gone is the relentlessly slicked back hair and in its place a decidedly more dishevelled look; while open neck shirts and rolled up sleeves have replaced the rigid tailoring of the campaign.

Pumping gas at his local station in La Jolla Romney was happy to talk to bystanders.

One, mkb95, posted on Reddit: 'Mitt Romney at my local gas station...he looks tired and washed up.'

Romney chatted, 'for a good three minutes while he was filling his tank,' and among the chat he spoke of his and Ann's intended move to La Jolla.

After his relations with the Republican party turned distinctly chilly little wonder that Romney should choose to spend his time on the more clement Califoranian coast.
