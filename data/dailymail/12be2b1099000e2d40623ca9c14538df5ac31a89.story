A 19-year-old who sold his news app to Yahoo for $30 million in 2013 now divides his time between being a full-time student at Oxford University and spending his holidays as a part-time product manager for the tech company in Silicon Valley.

London-born Nick D'Aloisio was just 15 when he created his popular iPhone app Summly, which condensed long web pages of text into easy to read bullet points.

At 17 Yahoo paid him $30 million to buy his app, which was relaunched at the start of this year as Yahoo News Digest - a twice daily briefing of summarized news.

Yet despite being one of the richest teenagers in the world, D'Aloisio also started studying philosophy and computer science at Oxford University just a couple of months ago.

When he isn't studying, D'Aloisio flies to San Francisco and spends his time meeting with Yahoo executives and his colleagues on the digest team.

Apple has chosen the news app as one of the launch partners for its Watch, the wearable device due out in 2015, reports FT.com.

Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer is looking to the company's mobile development team to develop a version of D'Aloisio's app to work on a watch-sized interface - something the 19-year-old is taking in his stride.

'It's been very fun,' D'Aloisio told San Jose Mercury News. 'I still have work to be done with the digest. I've been given such a big opportunity, I don't want to waste that.'

The student has an agreement with Yahoo where he only works on its products in between his school terms.

In the next few weeks he hopes to complete the AppleWatch app and other projects before he returns to Oxford in January for his exams. 

D'Aloisio says he enjoys juggling the two things. 'I'm really, really loving Oxford,' he said. 

'It was founded in like twelve-hundred-and-something. ...It's very juxtaposed to the Valley, very different.'

Much as D'Aloisio likes to imagine that he might one day become a philosopher, he also says that he is 'too passionate about building things' to stop developing apps. 

His 'dream scenario' he says would be to build his own big company, possibly involving artificial intelligence and neural networks.
