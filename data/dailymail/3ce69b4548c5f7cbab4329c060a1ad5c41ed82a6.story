Sergio Aguero could have signed for Bayern Munich back in 2006 but the club and then-coach Felix Magath decided the player was too lazy.

Aguero tormented Pep Guardiola's Bayern side on Tuesday night, his hat-trick leading Manchester City to a late 3-2 victory in the Champions League.

But the Argentina striker may well have been playing for the German team had history taken a slightly different course.

Bayern were one of the first European teams to investigate signing Aguero in 2006, when the then 17-year-old was playing for Buenos Aires side Independiente, the Munich press reminded readers on Wednesday.

Karl-Heinz Rummenigge tried to push through a deal

Resigned to selling Aguero, the Argentinian club were demanding £12million, a fee which Bayern's then general manager Uli Hoeness was reluctant to pay. Bayern, for all their big spending, have always made a point of not being held to ransom by other clubs.

Hoeness' colleague Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, however, attempted to push the deal through, arguing that, 'he (Aguero) wouldn't be a bargain, but he is very talented. 

'We need to get in before the Italians and the Spaniards, otherwise it will be seriously expensive'.

Hoeness thus attended an Independiente game during a trip to Argentina, but remained unconvinced by Aguero's work rate. In an interview with SportBild in 2011, the Bayern boss said: 'His team mates were warming up, and Aguero was just leaning on the fence. The only thing he did in the whole game was to win and score a penalty'.

Those words may have come back to haunt Hoeness, now in prison for tax evasion, as he saw Aguero win and score a penalty for Manchester City against Bayern.

Rather than the £12m being demanded for  Aguero, Hoeness made an offer of £4m, and was laughed off by Independiente.

Still unsure, Hoeness then decided to send Bayern's first team coach at the time, none other than Fulham flop Magath, to see what he thought of Aguero. After flying to South America and watching one match, Magath came back immensely frustrated.

Aguero has gone on to become one of the best strikers in world football but wasn't worth £12m in 2006

'Never waste my free time again', he told Hoeness, 'it's too precious to watch a player who does nothing but stand around for the whole game'.

Thus Bayern's verdict was complete. Aguero, who would later sign for Atletico Madrid, and of course Manchester City, was too lazy, too expensive, and not gifted enough for Bayern Munich. Signing him at the age of 17 would have been too risky, and potentially harmful to the club.

Eight years later, it turns out that Hoeness and Magath were right. Aguero did hurt Bayern after all.
