A black Labrador named Eclipse is so eager to get to the dog park she often catches the bus - on her own. 

If the two-year-old's owner Jeff Young takes too long finishing his cigarette, and their bus arrives, Eclipse climbs aboard solo and rides to her stop.

The trick delights her fellow Seattle bus passengers. Radio host Miles Montgomery was amazed to see the pooch get off the bus at the dog park alone last week, and began looking into it.

Morning commute: Eclipse, middle, rides the bus from her Seattle home to a dog park nearby if her owner Jeff Young takes too long to finish his cigarette and board with her

Mr Montgomery told Komo News : 'It doesn't really appear to have an owner. 

'The dog gets off at the dog park. I just look out the window and I'm like, 'did that just happen?''

'She was most concerned about seeing out the window, and I couldn't figure out what that was. It was really just about seeing where her stop was.' 

Mr Young said if Eclipse gets on the bus without him, he catches up with her at the dog park which is three or four strops away.  

He said: 'It's not hard to get on. She gets on in front of her house and she gets off at the dog park, three or four stops later.'

Mr Young said the tradition has been going on for a while.

'She's been here the last two years, so she's been urbanized, totally. She's a bus-riding, sidewalk-walking dog,' he said.

'Probably once a week I get a phone call. 'Hi. I have your dog Eclipse here on 3rd and Bell. 'I have to tell them, 'no. She's fine.' She knows what she's doing.'

Bus riders report Eclipse hops onto seats next to strangers and watches out the window intently for her stop. 

Commuter Tiona Rainwater said: 'All the bus drivers know her. She sits here just like a person does.

'She makes everybody happy.'

Mr Young added: 'It makes their (other commuters) day. 'It's a good part of their day and it works out for her so I just let it go.' 

A Metro Transit spokesman said the agency loves that a dog appreciates public transit.
