A T-shirt with a joke about the child abuse allegations surrounding disgraced DJ and TV presenter Jimmy Savile and Gary Glitter is being sold on auction site eBay.

The T-shirt shows paedophile former pop star Gary Glitter wearing the once-iconic 'Jim Fixed It For Me' medallion that Savile handed out to youngsters who appeared on the hit show Jim'll Fix It.

Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, is alleged to have raped a 13-year-old girl in Savile's BBC dressing room in the 1970s.The 68-year-old former pop star, who was convicted of possessing child porn in 1999 and found guilty of molesting a pair of girls aged ten and 11 by a Vietnamese court in 2006, may face arrest over the accusations, according to a source quoted in The People.

Is that supposed to be funny?: The shirt sells for £8 on auction site eBay. The NSPCC has condemned it as 'distressing'

For sale: The T-shirt's listing on eBay. Four people have already bought the £8 item of clothing

The £8 T-shirt, available on eBay from seller blludog, has been purchased by four people already. Another T-shirt has a picture of Savile with the 'a' in his name replaced with an 'o' to read 'So Vile'.

Other items available on the auction site include an authentic 'Jim Fixed it for Me' medallion, which has attracted two bids with an asking price of £79.99, badges, a soap on a rope, autographs and signed photos.

Children's charity NSPCC has criticised the shirt and believes it will cause 'distress'.

An NSPCC spokesperson said: 'It’s hard to believe that anyone would make jokes about child sexual abuse. We hope that most people would not purchase such a T-shirt due to the distress it is likely to cause.

'It takes a lot of courage for the victims of child abuse to speak out and the NSPCC is here 24 hours a day to provide help and advice on 0808 800 5000.'

Last week Karin Ward made claims that she was abused at 14, along with two fellow pupils of Duncroft Approved School for Girls, the Surrey school where Savile is accused of preying on under-age girls.

Allegations: A still from Glitter's appearance on Jim'll Fix It in 1991. A woman claims Glitter and Savile sexually abused under age girls at the same time in Savile's dressing room at the BBC

Karin Ward told a documentary maker she saw Gary Glitter have sex with an underage girl in Jimmy Savile's dressing room

She told ITV News the three girls were taken to Savile’s dressing room at BBC Television Centre after being invited to London by the DJ in the 1970s. There she claims to have seen Glitter have sex with the teenager.

A joint police and NSPCC inquiry into Savile called Operation Yewtree is underway to investigate the torrent of claims which coincided with the screening of an ITV documentary on Savile, who died last year. Police have already formally recorded eight criminal allegations – two rapes and six of indecent assault - and have identified at least 30 victims.

Yesterday it was announced that the BBC will draft in an ‘independent’ troubleshooter to lead an inquiry into the Savile scandal.
