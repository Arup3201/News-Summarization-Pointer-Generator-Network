FIFA Puskas award runner-up Stephanie Roche has announced she is joining National Women's Soccer League side Houston Dash.

The Republic of Ireland international, who only signed for French side ASPTT Albi in July last year, has penned a two-year deal with the American outfit.

The 25-year-old forward, who has scored four times for her country, became the first women to be shortlisted for the prestigious accolade in December, after a stunning volleyed goal for former side Peamount United against Wexford Youths in October 2013.

The goal ensured she became an internet sensation on YouTube, which in turn catapulted her onto the international stage.

The forward left Ireland to move over to France in July, but Roche admits she rushed into the decision and didn't take several key factors into consideration.

In an interview with the Irish Independent she said: 'I have taken my time with this. A lot of people have been asking me where I was going.

'With France I think I may have jumped into it too fast. I didn't think about everything. I never thought the language barrier would be as big an issue as it turned out to be in the end. 

'No Irish woman has ever gone over to play in the NWSL though, so it is going to be a big challenge for me. I am under no illusions it is going to be easy.

'I am going to have to work hard and get my place in the team so I am really looking forward to getting over and meeting my team-mates and getting to know them better.'

Dash head coach Randy Waldrum expressed his delight at the signing adding: 'I am so excited about the signing of Stephanie.

'We are getting a player that has great technical ability, a superb left foot, and possibly the best goalscorer to come out of Ireland since Olivia O'Toole.

'She will bring a wealth of international experience to our team, and another great attacking option that is different from what we have already. 

'All our Dash fans and fans of women's soccer in general will be excited about this signing.'

Roche is expected to make her debut on April 10 against Washington Spirit at the BBVA Compass Stadium, pending receipt of her P-1 Visa and ITC, which were not disclosed in the deal.
