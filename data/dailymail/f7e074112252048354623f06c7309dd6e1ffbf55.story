The Dow Jones industrial average fell almost 300 points or 1.62 percent on Tuesday, raising concerns about a global economic slowdown.

Today's 272 point drop was the biggest single fall since July 31 and is the sixth drop in seven trading sessions on Wall Street

Industrial production in Germany, Europe's largest economy, dropped the most in five years and the International Monetary Fund trimmed its outlook for global growth this year and next.

However, the IMF said Tuesday that the global economy will grow still 3.3 percent this year, which is slightly below what it forecast in July.

The U.S. stock market fell 274 points on Tuesday, following poor manufacturing results in Germany

Drops since July 31: The Dow Jones closed today at 272.52 point down - and is the sixth trading day fall out of seven and comes off the back of poor economic data from Germany

U.S. growth may be strengthening, but the outlook elsewhere is far less encouraging. On Tuesday the International Monetary Fund trimmed its forecast for global economic growth. A surprisingly weak report on industrial production in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, added to the concerns.

Industrial companies, whose fortunes are closely tied those of the global economy, led the sell-off. Government bonds rallied as investors snapped up safe assets, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note close to its lowest level of the year.

After a weak September, the slump in stocks is showing no signs of abating in October. The Standard & Poor's index has now dropped almost 4 percent since closing at a record Sept. 18.

'Investors have become a bit more cautious about earnings and about the pace of global growth,' said Kate Warne, a principal at Edward Jones, an investment firm. 'That reassessment is leading to a bit more caution on stocks.'

US. stocks ended sharply lower on Tuesday, with major indexes falling 1 percent in heavy trading, as weak data out of Germany raised concerns about the strength of global growth ahead of the start of earnings season.

The International Monetary Fund cut its global economic growth forecasts for the third time this year, suggesting the environment remains difficult for companies, especially ones with multinational exposure.

The day's losses were broad, with all ten primary S&P 500 sectors ending lower, although cyclical shares - tied to the pace of economic growth - led the decline. Industrial shares lost 2.4 percent, while financials shed 1.8 percent and material companies sank 1.8 percent.

Joy Global Inc fell 4.2 percent to $51.69 while Caterpillar Inc lost 3.4 percent to $94.70 as the biggest decliner on the Dow. Boeing Co lost 2.3 percent to $123.32.

Worries: The prospects of weakening global growth weighed on the stock market Tuesday

German industrial output in August slid 4 percent, the biggest fall in 5-1/2 years, a day after a report showed industrial orders had their biggest monthly drop since 2009.

'The number was very weak, which makes for a tough backdrop. I don't think this is a trend of something that will get horrible, but it is weak and current valuations demand that data be better than weak,' said Hayes Miller, who oversees about $57 billion as the Boston-based head of asset allocation in North America at Baring Asset Management.

With the day's decline, the S&P 500 fell back below its 100-day moving average, a sign of weakening near-term momentum. The CBOE Volatility index rose 11 percent to 17.2, near a level that has recently been taken as an indication the market is oversold.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 272.52 points, or 1.6 percent, to 16,719.39, the S&P 500 lost 29.72 points, or 1.51 percent, to 1,935.1, ending at its lowest level since Aug. 12. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 69.60 points, or 1.56 percent, to 4,385.20.
