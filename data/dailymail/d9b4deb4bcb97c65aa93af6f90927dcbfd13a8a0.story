Arrested: Efraim Carmona faces five counts of intoxicated manslaughter for the death of five people in a wrong-way crash later Sunday night

Five people were killed – including a young child – when a
suspected drunk driver going the wrong way Sunday on a Houston highway slammed
into the pickup truck they were riding in, authorities said.

Efraim Carmona, 34, faces five counts of intoxication
manslaughter and one count of intoxication assault for the injuries to the lone
survivor, a female who was airlifted to a nearby hospital.

The 11.00 p.m. accident occurred on a busy highway on the
city’s outskirts and caused it to be closed until just before the morning rush,
according to KHOU.

Carmona was driving a flatbed truck when he entered the Sam Houston
Tollway’s westbound lanes – but he was tragically heading east, said police.

Local reports showed the entrance virtually blanketed in
wrong way and do not enter signs, but Carmona still entered the highway, cops said.

He then hit the packed Ford F-150 pickup head-on, cops said.
It is not clear how fast either car was traveling, but the roadway’s speed
limit is 65mph.

The Ford pickup immediately burst into flames, and five of
its occupants were killed instantly. Authorities declined to identify the
victims when reached by MailOnline.

The weapon: This is all that is left of the flat bed truck Carmona was reportedly driving

Horrific: It is a miracle one person survived this crash, but there is no word on whether she is expected to recover from her injuries

Unrecognizable: There was not much left of the Ford F-150 after the head-on collision

Shutdown: The Sam Houston Tollway (beltway) was closed for most of the overnight until just before Monday morning's rush hour

The lone survivor is still in the hospital, her condition is
not known.

Carmona was also taken to a local hospital, but appeared to
emerge from the wreck virtually unscathed in a mug shot provided by the Harris
County Sheriff’s Office.

Debris was scattered all over the highway, circles the city
and is referred to locally as the beltway. Very little remained of the scorched
pickup, its roof was completely gone and multiple doors lie on the side of the
road.

The flatbed truck’s front end was smashed in, but the damage
does not appear to have been life-threatening.

No further information is available at this time.
