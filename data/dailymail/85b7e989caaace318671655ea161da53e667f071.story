Visiting a country when you don’t speak the language is tricky enough, let alone when that country uses a different alphabet.

To tackle this problem, Google has updated its Translate app to recognise handwriting written in 13 new languages including Arabic, Bosnian, Cebuano, Gujarati, Hmong, Kannada, Maltese, Mongolian, Persian, Punjabi, Somali, Tamil, and Telugu.

People visiting other countries can use the update to translate phrases into another language, or they can write the symbols they see on signs and menus, for example, to see an automatic translation.

The latest Google Translate app update has added support for 13 new languages including Arabic, Bosnian, Cebuano, Gujarati, Hmong, Kannada, Maltese, Mongolian, Persian, Punjabi, Somali, Tamil, and Telugu. This brings the total number of supported handwritten languages to 58

If a language can be translated using 
handwriting, a symbol will appear in the bottom right of the input box 
that looks like a squiggle.

Text input is set as default, but pressing the squiggle opens up a virtual notepad that users can draw and write on.

To
 make the handwriting box bigger or smaller, touch and hold the drag 
icon and drag it up or down on the screen. 

Google reads these symbols, converts them to text, and offers a translation.

Users need to select the languages they want to translate from and to.

There is additionally the option to 
translate via photo or voice.

Google first added handwriting support to its Translate app on Android in January 2012.

In July, this tool was added to the Google Translate homepage, and in September last year it was added to the iPhone and iPad app.

This brings the total number of supported handwritten languages to 58, although Google can translate a total of 80 languages using text, photo and voice input.

If a language can be translated using handwriting a symbol will appear in the bottom right of the input box that looks like a squiggle.

Text input is set as default, but pressing the squiggle opens up a virtual notepad that users can draw and write on.

There is also the option to translate via voice.

Although international keyboards support a number of foreign alphabets, symbols associated with these languages are simpler when written manually. 

In a blogpost, Google said: ‘Our goal is to break down the language barrier, all the time, everywhere.

‘By adding handwriting input directly into our app we hope to help you get translation done even more quickly and easily.

‘Sometimes you don’t know how to say what you want translated, sometimes you can’t type it, and sometimes it’s easier just to write it.’
