England's Fragapane, who was the top qualifier and fresh from winning all-around gold, was the last gymnast to compete.

The 16-year-old scored 14.766 on vault one before her second effort of 14.500 gave her an average of 14.633 and propelled her to the top of the standings.

Following her second individual success, Fragapane said: 'Last night I went back to my room and tried not to look at my phone or anything, and just tried to get prepared for the next day.

'I got a little bit of sleep but I was still buzzing and felt a little bit of pressure.

'This doesn't feel real - it feels weird to be here.'
