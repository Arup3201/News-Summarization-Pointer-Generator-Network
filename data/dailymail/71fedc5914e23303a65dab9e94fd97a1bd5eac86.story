Massachusetts medical examiners have identified body parts found on a beach in Swampscott as those of a 25-year-old woman who went missing in November.

The Essex District Attorney's Office said on Friday that the remains found on King's Beach on Wednesday were identified as those of Jaimee Mendez of Swampscott, who was last seen on Nov. 6.

The diabetic mother of a 5-year-old autistic child went missing after calling family to tell them she was with a 'known sex offender,' 

Missing: Jaimee Mendez  from Swampscott, Massachusetts, vanished on Thursday after calling friends to say she was with a man who was 'acting weird'. She has a severely autistic five-year-old son

'She was worried, she was freaked out, she was with this guy, he was acting weird, she wanted to get out of there,' her sister Alyssa Mendez told NECN.

'The guy that she called went to pick her up and she never showed. And that's it. That's the last time anyone heard from her. Her phone's been off, until they found her phone - they found her phone and her jacket, and her ID ... in Salem.'

She wanted a someone to come and pick her up, family said. Mendez got someone to agree to help and drove to pick her up, but when he arrived she wasn't there.

The Chief Medical Examiner's Office identified Mendez through dental records. Officials have not yet determined the cause and manner of death.  

Police aren't releasing information on any suspects. 

Her family have said she was in the company of a convicted sex offender when she was last heard from, but he has not been named.  

Plea: The 25-year-old mother asked those who she called to come and pick her up. One agreed to help but when he arrived Jaimee was nowhere to be seen

A State Police dive team member reaches for a line at Floating Bridge Pond in Lynn, Mass in November where the search continued fruitlessly for missing Jaimee Mendez for months

nvestigators found her phone, jacket and ID dumped in a parking lot five miles away in Salem and confirmed she did not have her vital medicines, including insulin, with her.

A short time later, they then discovered her sneakers,  a rug and men's clothing in a dumpster outside a CVS in nearby Lynn.

Her father Stephen said she cannot go for more than four days without her insulin and said she has never spent a day away from her five-year-old son, who is severely autistic.

'The guy that she called went to pick her up and she never showed. And that's it. That's the last time anyone heard from her. Her phone's been off, until they found her phone - they found her phone and her jacket, and her ID in Salem,' her sister said.
