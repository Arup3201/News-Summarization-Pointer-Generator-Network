Two California teachers who were arrested on allegations of engaging in sexual encounters on the beach with their male high school students will not be charged with sexual assault.

However, South Hills High School teachers Melody Lippert, 38, and Michelle Ghirelli, 30, both from Covina, were each charged yesterday with one misdemeanor count of contributing to the delinquency of a minor after allegedly providing alcohol to students.

They could face a maximum sentence of one year in jail if convicted.

Prosecutors said they found insufficient evidence to file sexual assault charges.

As the investigation continues, Lippert and Ghirelli could also face additional charges as investigators look into other allegations, according to the LA Times.

The teachers were arrested on January 17, with Lippert on charges of conspiracy and contributing to the delinquency of a minor while Ghirelli was charged with copulation and unlawful sex with a minor. 

They were both released after posting bail and currently remain on paid administrative leave.

'The Covina-Valley Unified School District is shocked by the Orange County District Attorney's decision with regards to the charges filed. 

'However, we recognize that the investigation is continuing and additional charges could be forthcoming,' spokesperson Michelle Van Der Linden said in a written statement. 

'As teachers and administrators who work closely and in a trusted position with children, we hold ourselves to a higher standard. 

'We are subject to the Education Code and our Board policies and as such, we will continue with our own investigation and have created our own draft statement of charges for dismissal, which will be delivered to both individuals.'

Lippert, who has taught as a teacher for the Covina-Valley Unified School District for 15 years, had met up with a group of male students from her high school at a beach in San Clemente last November, on a trip that was not school sponsored, according to CBS.

In initial reports, Lippert had reportedly given the group alcohol and then engaged in a sexual act with one of the students, according to deputies.

She then made plans to meet up with the students for a second liaison at the same spot, bringing along Ghirelli, who has been teaching for the district for five years.

The pair then met up with five students of the same group on a non-school sponsored camping trip from December 27 to 29, spending a night on the beach.

The teachers are set to be arraigned on Friday morning at the Harbor Justice Center. 

The district has also launched an investigation into the incident. 

It has also reportedly began the process of firing Lippert and Ghirelli, along with three other employees who have been accused of violating district policies.
