An arena spotlight collapsed on top of a high school wrestler in South Dakota on Friday leaving him lucky to survive.

A spectator caught the dramatic moment Michael McComish was pinned to the ground by the 100- pound spotlight in a video that has since become an internet sensation.

The senior was left needing 20 stitches after the rope holding the light 15 feet above the mat snapped during his wrestling contest at Madison Middle School.

McComish told KSFY: 'After a couple of seconds I realized what it was - I noticed all the glass and thought 'ok, this isn't good''.

'I thought this guy's kind of aggressive and then I realized it was the light. Everyone's been asking if I'm going to look up every time I wrestle now,' he told Today.

His mother, Heather Bergheim told the Madison Daily Leader:  ‘We are very thankful it was not more serious. We are hoping for the best and taking it just one day at a time.’

McComish is seen crouching into position in the center circle at the start of the video, but as the wrestler looks to the floor the light suddenly crashes on top of him.

His opponent and the referee jump back in shock before rushing to help free him. 

He was taken to hospital and needed stitches in his forehead and the back of his head.

‘Just letting everyone know I’m fine! Stitches in my head,’ McComish wrote on his Twitter. ‘Gash on forehead and back of me head and little cuts from the glass nothin serious.’

'It zipped down right square on top of him,' Onlooker and former Madison Junior High principal  Dale Waba told the Daily Leader: 'There was no part of his body you could see. I thought he got burned. I have never seen anything like this at all, and I have attended all of these matches.'

The match-up between and Chamberlain's Thomas Swanson was part of an annual event billed ‘Madison Square Garden’

A statement from the school said: 'The unfortunate accident that occurred on Friday was indeed a scary moment for everyone involved. We are thankful to report that (McComish) is recovering and is in school.'
