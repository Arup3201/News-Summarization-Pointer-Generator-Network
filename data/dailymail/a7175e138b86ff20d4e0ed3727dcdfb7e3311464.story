Stand-in: Aaron Mast's friends and family took a cardboard cutout of him to all big events while he was serving in Afghanistan

Soldier Aaron Mast thought he had missed out on nine months of weddings, birthday parties and even Christmas while serving in Afghanistan.

But when the 29-year-old returned he discovered he had been on a simultaneous tour of duty at home after his friends took a cardboard stand-in of him to every big event.

Mr Mast had made the cutout for a friend's wedding that he couldn't make, but he was shocked to learn it became a project for his friends and family.

''It really sucked being away from my friends and family for such a long time and I hated missing out on big events like weddings and birthdays,' said the solider from  Dover, Delaware, said.

'But I had no idea that it would turn into such an amazing project for all my friends and family to keep me in their thoughts while I was away.'

After enlisting in 2003, Mr Mast served two tours in Iraq, the first in 2005 and the second in 2008.

Last March he was due to go overseas for his third tour as a sergeant in a communications unit when he realised he would be away for the marriage of his good friends Christina and JJ.

Fed up of missing out on wedding photos, Mr Mast decided to have cardboard cut-out of himself made and left it in the care of his friends so he could still feature in the snaps on their big day.

His lifesize cutout, dressed in a smart black tie, made it into all the photos and was even pictured swigging whisky at the bar and dancing with bridesmaids.

During his nine month tour his cardboard model attended a friend's hen-do

But his enthusiastic friends didn't stop there, and started taking him to parties, bars and family events.

As the real Mr Mast trekked around Afghanistan dismantling US army bases in preparation for the allied forces exit from the country, his alter-ego was celebrating Christmas and Halloween back in Delaware.

The model was snapped at a New Year's Eve party, on stage with a local band and even at Christina's hen party but he only realised when he started being tagged on Facebook at events he hadn't been able to attend. 

His devoted friend Paula DePrima took the cut-out everywhere with her, looking after it at the first wedding and making sure he always got in on the action.

When he got back to the United States in February 2014 the pair got together as a couple and they're now looking forward to spending Christmas together for real.

'All of my friends got involved and took me to my family's house for big holidays,' said Mr Mast.

'I think it was great for my mum that she felt like I could be there in part for her birthday.

'They always say that I am the life and soul of the party and that having my semi-attendance made a big difference.

'It was even bigger than I could have imagined.

'I only got access to the internet once a week so every time I logged on I could see what my friends had been up to and where my cut-out had been.

'The cardboard me got lots of attention.

'It was really encouraging knowing that my friends were thinking of me while I was away serving my country and humbling to know that they were lugging a giant cardboard model around to all these parties.

'Paula took the cut-out under her wing at the wedding and after that she carried me everywhere - I think she realised how attached she was to me while I was away.

'Having the cut-out fill in for me while I was abroad was great but I'm glad to be in attendance for real this year.'
