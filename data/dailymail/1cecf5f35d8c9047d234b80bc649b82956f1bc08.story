Painter Ross Ashmore has given a new meaning to the term 'underground art' - after painting 217 tube stations.

The artist has spent years creating the oil paintings of all the stops inside the first four zones.

He hopes to complete the remaining 50 from London Undergroundâ€™s famous map in zone nine by summer.

The 56-year-old former graphic designer, from Rickmansworth, in Hertfordshire, will have painted 267 different oil painting impressions of Underground stations by the time the project is complete.

The dad-of-three said: 'I realise for me this has to do with my commercial past. I was always under pressure to deliver on time, except this time I had created my own brief and deadline.

'I love the Underground. I love the concept of going below ground and resurfacing somewhere else.

'Because society is changing so fast I want to document the underground stations in paint - even since painting the stations, some of them have undergone changes already.

'A Doctor Who episode "Web of Fear" in 1968 also had a big impact on me as a youngster featuring the "Yetis" in the Underground!'

Mr Ashmore's work is currently on show at the SPACE gallery in Southgate, north London, with around 100 of his paintings on display.
