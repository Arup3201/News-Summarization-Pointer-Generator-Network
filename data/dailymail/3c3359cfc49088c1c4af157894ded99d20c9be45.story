Nick Clegg delivered what was branded an ‘electoral suicide note’ last night as he boasted of blocking a string of 16 Tory policies.

The Deputy Prime Minister pointed out how he had prevented the Government from cutting inheritance tax, scrapping the Human Rights Act and reining in green energy.

In an attempt to echo Margaret Thatcher’s famous declaration, Mr Clegg cried ‘no, no, no’ as he cast the Liberal Democrats as a perpetual brake on Conservative excess.

Nick Clegg was accused of delivering an 'electoral suicide note' by boasting of blocking 16 Tory policies

The Deputy Prime Minister (pictured embracing wife Miriam) said he had prevented the Government from cutting inheritance tax, scrapping the Human Rights Act and reining in green energy

He used his conference speech to revel in having frustrated his Coalition partners’ attempts to:

■ Cut inheritance tax

■ Bring back O-levels

■ Encourage more providers to run free schools by allowing them to make profits

■ Relax childcare ratios to reduce costs for parents

■ Cut employment red tape by allowing no-fault dismissal

■ Implement regional pay in the public sector

■ Remove housing benefit from  the under-25s

■ Ditch the Human Rights Act

■ Relax the Equalities Act

■ Automatically renew the Trident nuclear deterrent

■ Carry on with ‘go home’ poster vans aimed at illegal immigrants

■ Change constituency boundaries

■ Scrap Natural England

■ Limit green energy

■ Stop geography teachers teaching about climate change

■ Foil the ‘snoopers’ charter’

Clegg's claims have been ridiculed including his suggestion that there would not have been economic growth without the Liberal Democrats

A senior Tory backbencher quickly labelled Mr Clegg’s list of blocked policies an ‘electoral suicide note’. Addressing activists, Mr Clegg said that in the past, he had ‘always thought it was better to tell people about the things you’ve achieved, not just the things you’ve stopped’.

But he said: ‘People do need to know how coalition operates and what we do day in, day out.’

His decision to then reel off 16 policies his party has stymied will be seen as the start of the two Coalition parties distancing themselves from each other ahead of the 2015 general election.

But it delighted Conservative MPs, who said he had helped to illustrate what a majority Tory government could achieve after 2015.

Mr Clegg rewrote history yesterday, telling his party how he vetoed changes to constituency boundaries after his Tory partners broke a political deal.

In August last year he declared the Lib Dems would vote against the changes recommended by an independent commission. 

The changes would have allowed the Conservatives to gain around another 20 seats at the next election.

Mr Clegg said he had acted in retaliation for the Tories’ opposition to his pet project for reform of the House of Lords and said they had broken the Coalition ‘contract’ they had made.

In fact the 2010 Coalition deal links boundary changes to the referendum on the Alternative Vote system, not Lords reform. 

The Coalition agreement  bound the Conservatives simply to set up a committee to suggest changes, which they did.

But when the plans came to Parliament, Labour voted against them and the Prime Minister told Mr Clegg he was unable to stop a revolt by 91 of his backbenchers.

They also ridiculed his claim that if he had not been in power with the Tories, there would have been no economic growth.

Often in coalition, Mr Clegg said, compromise ‘just isn’t possible and you just have to say “No”’.

‘Inheritance tax cuts for millionaires
 – No. Bringing back O-levels and a two-tier education system – No. 
Profit-making in schools – No. New childcare ratios – No. Firing workers
 at will, without any reasons given – No, absolutely no. Regional pay 
penalising public-sector workers in the North – No,’ he said.

‘Scrapping
 housing benefits for young people – No. No to ditching the Human Rights
 Act. No to weakening the protections in the Equalities Act.’

The Lib Dem leader also spoke of scuppering Tory plans to make Parliamentary boundaries fairer and resisting Tory attempts to water down green energy plans.

‘No, no and no. The Liberal Democrats will keep this Government green,’ Mr Clegg said.

He also appeared in little doubt that the Lib Dems will remain in government after the next election, declaring he could get on with either David Cameron or Ed Miliband – but would ‘do a better job’ than either of them.

He said the Lib Dems were ‘no one’s little brother’, earning the loudest cheers as he added: ‘We’re not here to prop up the two-party system, we’re here to bring it down’.

His party represented the ‘liberal centre’ as the Tories drifted to the Right and Labour to the Left.

He suggested coalitions are now ‘the norm’ for Britain, meaning the Lib Dems could now become a fixture in power, an ‘anchor’ holding back both the Tories and Labour.

Mr Clegg condemned ‘bizarre’ Tory views on Britain’s place in Europe, saying leaving would jeopardise millions of jobs and reduce its influence in the world.

‘We are the party of in,’ he declared. Mr Clegg said ‘vitriol’ had been heaped upon him since he entered a power-sharing deal with Mr Cameron in 2010. But he insisted ‘every snipe’ had been worth it ‘because we are turning Britain around’.

Former Tory Defence Secretary Liam Fox said of Mr Clegg’s list of blocked policies: ‘Liberal Democrats are showing themselves in their true colours.

‘It’s clear they’re hugely out of step with the policies that Britain wants and needs.’

It appears Nick Clegg was not the only one who worked to slim down ahead of the conference. His wife Miriam looked distinctly more svelte compared with last year (right) as she accompanied him to the keynote speech yesterday (left). Mrs Clegg stood out in a flattering £45.99 Zara coral dress cinched in with a blue belt. She completed her recession-inspired outfit with white Topshop heels

Tory MP Peter Bone said: ‘Nick Clegg has just exposed the worst aspects of coalition government. Most people in my constituency would have wanted the reforms Nick Clegg has blocked. The Prime Minister has been governing with one arm tied behind his back.

‘If we could dump Clegg and his merry band of Lefties we would be able to get more welfare reform. The British public want to see a British Bill of Rights rather than the Human Rights Act.

‘In Nick Clegg’s world this list may appeal to the 8 per cent of people who vote Lib Dem but in the rest of the country this is effectively an electoral suicide note.’

Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, said the notion that the Lib Dems should be in every government was ‘bizarre’, and that the approach could backfire, adding: ‘Party leaders should be setting out the things they believe in and the things they would do if elected with a majority, not telling us what they don’t like.’
