Could autonomous drones be used to transport hazardous materials to safety?

That’s what engineers at Imperial College London are aiming for with their newest project, which uses robotic drones to move objects.

And they say their system could be used to safely dispose of objects such as nuclear waste containers in the future.

A team of engineers led by Dr Mirko Kovac at the Aerial Robotics Laboratory at Imperial College London have revealed their flying robots that can transport nuclear waste containers to safe locations by spraying them with foam and then carrying them away

The team is led by Dr Mirko Kovac, director of the Aerial Robotics Laboratory.

The flying 3D-printer and collection system consists of two robots.

One robot is a quadcopter with four blades, which is used to dispense polyurethane foam through a nozzle.

Through a system of 16 infrared cameras, the robot then ‘prints’ the foam onto the target, such as a nuclear waste-filled container.

Next the second, a hexacopter with six blades, steps in.

On the bottom of this drone is a flat surface which the foam previously laid by the first robot adheres to when it lands on the target.

This drone then flies away with the object, taking it to a safe location.

This method allows a wide array of objects to be collected, no matter the shape.

The project is known as ‘3D printing with flying robots' and has been in developed over the past 12 months, starting life as a tank-like robot before taking to the skies.

The group has developed flying drones that work in tandem to print sticky foam on an object and then carry it away.

One robot sprays a target with foam, and another lands on it and sticks to it.

It then takes off and transports the target to a safe distance.

This target could be a container with nuclear waste inside, that would be hazardous for humans to handle.

Although the system requires some manual input for now, in the future the team hopes to allow the robots to perform the entire task of autonomously detecting, spraying and collecting an object themselves.

This is a first step towards a concept of a robotic 'nest' say the engineers, where in principle a robot can construct a platform and use it to extend its range by landing to recharge, or collect and deliver objects.

‘This is an exciting first step in the lab's development of cooperative robotic systems for building structures inspired by the natural world, in this case bird nesting behaviour,’ says Thomas Creedy, ecologist at the Natural History Museum who works with the Aerial Robotics Lab.

‘The aim is that these systems will enable a wide range of robotic applications, in particular extending the operating scope of scientific survey robots in challenging environments such as rainforests through the adaptable construction of recharging platforms or monitoring stations.’

The two drones, one a quadcopter (four blades) and the other a hexacopter (six blades), work in tandem to move a target. The first sprays it with foam (pictured), and the second then sticks to it before flying away

As the concept is developed, project lead Dr Kovac envisages a future where such robots roam freely in the wild.

‘Swarms of flying robots will inhabit natural and urban areas as living sensor nodes that will be able to interact with the environment and move in varied terrain effectively,’ he says.

‘They will build nests to recharge their batteries with solar cells and to observe the environment.

'Like in nature, the robots will have specialised functions and division of labour.

'Using swarm intelligence, the robots will be able to perform very complex tasks of autonomous inspection and aerial construction effectively.

'For example, inspection drones will create a 3D scan to detect damage in hazardous environments and a second swarm of construction drones will selectively repair the structure with aerial 3D printing.

'The robots can detect and repair structural damage of hard to reach areas such as wind turbine blades, in nuclear reactors and in oil pipelines.

'Other applications include the protection of the environment and natural habitats, early detection of forest fires, monitoring of pollution levels and humanitarian aid in search and rescue scenarios.

'The next step will be to use swarms of 3D scanning and 3D printing robots to repair damaged structures with very high efficiency.'

Dr Kovac envisages a future where 'swarms of flying robots will inhabit natural and urban areas as living sensor nodes that will be able to interact with the environment and move in varied terrain effectively' and sees this project as an important step in that direction

Dr Kovac also reveals how they took inspiration from wildlife, such as swiftlets, to develop the robots.

'Biological inspiration is key to build truly innovative technical solutions,' he explains.

'We take inspiration from nest-building swiftlets that use saliva to build structures.

'We analyse and implement the underlying design principles that allows them to build nest very effectively.

'We don’t copy nature, we use the same principles and implement them using the best of robotic engineering.'

This is the first major output from the Aerial Robotics Lab, a relatively new research group at Imperial College London.

They say they have 'many new and exciting robotic developments' currently in construction.

The lab will be displaying some of their work, including these flying robots, at the Imperial Festival at Imperial's South Kensington campus, London this coming 9 and 10 May.
