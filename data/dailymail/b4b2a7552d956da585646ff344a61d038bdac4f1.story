 A tiny amusement park in Texas is bringing back a very special ride from yesteryear.

ZDT's Amusement Park, located in Seguin, is building the Famous Switchback Railway, a wooden shuttle coaster that will be the first of its kind in over a century and is set to open this summer.

The ride will feature a 63-foot-tall lift hill that drops riders at 45 mph into a pair of airtime hills, a 104-degree overbanked turn and another pair of airtime hills, even weaving through an old warehouse at one point.

Then, like other shuttle coasters, the riders will repeat the same route backwards.

The ride pays tribute to the famous Switch Back Railway, which was built back in 1884 in New York's Coney Island.

That ride reached a top speed of 6 mph, and only a few more were ever built, with one in Canada and one in Scotland.

Until now.

The owners of ZDT's, husband and wife Danny and  Sarah Donhauser, have only had the park for a few years, but have made it their goal to add a unique ride each year in hopes of drawing visitors away from nearby attractions like Six Flags Fiesta Texas and SeaWorld San Antonio.

Among the rides at the park are multi-level go-kart track that run in and out of an abandoned warehouse, rock climbing walls on the side of a silo and  a ride that uses water jets to simulate the feeling of being on a roller coaster.

And with the ride almost comnplete, the owners, who named the park after their children Zac, Danielle and Tiffany, are already looking forward to next summer's new ride.

'We’ve had a lot of ideas we’ve kicked around,' Sarah told the Los Angeles Times.

'I’m not sure what we’ll do next.'
