A Japanese man who has spent more than 45 years on death row will this week have a new appeal heard which could possibly lead to a retrial.

Hakamada Iwao, who was once a professional boxer, was sentenced to death for the murders of four people – his boss and the man’s family – by the the Shizuoka District Court in 1968.

Now 77, he is believed to be the world’s longest serving death row inmate, having spent more than half of his life in prison including 30 years in solitary confinement waiting to die.

The court ordered a retrial for Mr Hakamada, a former professional boxer, who was sentenced to death in 1968

There has long been speculation Hakamada was innocent, and in 2007 one of the three judges who originally convicted him publicly declared he had thought Hakamada was innocent.

Amnesty International claims new DNA tests undertaken in 2012 point to Hakamada’s innocence.

A spokeswoman said a hearing is expected to begin in Japan later this week to decide whether or not there will be a retrial. A decision is expected by the end of March.

Amid news of the new hearing, a rally was held in Japan earlier this week involving some well-known local personalities and Mr Hakamada’s 80-year-old sister Hideko, who has spent decades speaking out on behalf of her brother’s plight.

In an interview last year Hideko Hakamada said she was worried about the mental state of her brother, who now ‘talks nonsense’.

‘What I am worried about most is Iwao's health. If you put someone in jail for 47 years, it's too much to expect them to stay sane,’ Hideko Hakamada told AFP last year.

She added: ‘I truly believe Iwao didn't do it. But once police suspect you for a crime, that's the end of the story. It was like that back then, it is like that now.’

Japan carries out a handful of executions every year. Japan's 134 death-row inmates are usually confined to their cell with little or no contact with other inmates.

Prisoners are typically notified about their impending deaths just hours before they are hanged, and their families are told only after the execution.

Sara Saleh, spokeswoman for Amnesty International Australia, said Hakamada’s supporters are hopeful that a retrial will be granted.

‘Imagine making history by having this overturned, it would be great,’ Ms Saleh said.

‘For a man who has been waiting to die for 45 years, we have some serious concerns for his mental health and that he has spent so many years in solitary confinement. Despite all of that though we are extremely hopeful with this development.’
