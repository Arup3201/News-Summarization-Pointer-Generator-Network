With a public debate still raging and back-to-back fights on TV, you couldn't blame 'White Dee' for wanting to get away from it all.

The accidental star of Channel 4's Benefits Street has been spotted caravan-shopping - but the estimated £7,000 bill will be footed by her new PR manager.

He said it would buy the 44-year-old, real name Deirdre Kelly, the touring vehicle as a gift to escape the mass attention she has received and go on short breaks with her two children.

Dee - due to be interviewed by presenter Emily Maitlis on the BBC's Newsnight tomorrow - was spotted on Wednesday at Chichester Caravans in Birmingham where she looked inside a used Lunar Freelander, priced at £6,995.

The 10-year-old holiday vehicle is 19ft long and includes four berths and a full kitchenette including an electric oven and hob.

It is now listed as sold on the company's website, but the outspoken mother's manager said only that 'negotiations are in progress'.

Barry Tomes, who signed up as White Dee's manager less than two weeks ago, told MailOnline he would pay for the caravan so his client had somewhere to escape from it all.

'To buy a caravan for someone is not such a bad investment,' he said. 'I manage recording artists around the world and we would pay £10,000 or £20,000 to produce an album without knowing if the money will come back.

Joking around: It's been claimed offers have soared in, including for TV appearances and marriage proposals

Outspoken: Her brash attitude to being on benefits made White Dee a source of huge controversy

'James Turner Street is a nightmare street, she's got two children both at school so I suggested she might want somewhere to go away with the kids. It was my idea.

'We've been offered three or four holidays abroad and she's been offered a fabulous mobile home in the south of France.

'I've been doing this for 40 years - I was driving Rolls Royces for Lulu when I was 17 - but I've never seen so many offers from so many places. I certainly don't think she's a flash in the pan.'

Mr Tomes declined to expand on speculation that Dee, touted as a wannabe rapper, has been given a recording contract but said negotiations were under way.

She has also had a reported three marriage proposals since her appearances on Channel 4.

He said he is planning several other PR moves with the divisive 44-year-old, but added there was a 'serious side' to her too.

'James Turner Street is no different to streets all over this country,' he said. 'It's just the one that got on TV.'

'White Dee' proved to be one of the most controversial people featured on the Channel 4 documentary, exemplifying what some called a culture of choosing benefits over work.

But the channel has also been beset by claims that selective editing exploited its stars and turned them into little more than 'poverty porn' to bash the unfortunate.
