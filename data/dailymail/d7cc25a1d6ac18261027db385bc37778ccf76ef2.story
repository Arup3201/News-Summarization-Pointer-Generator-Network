He has already been billed as the new Raheem Sterling – and it’s easy to see why.

Like England’s star player, Rolando Aarons was born in Kingston, the capital of Jamaica, but has chosen to represent the Three Lions.

The Newcastle winger will make his debut for Aidy Boothroyd’s Under-20 side against Romania in Telford.

But comparisons with Sterling extend beyond the 18-year-old’s birth certificate. Both moved to the UK at a young age before being picked up by Football League clubs – Aarons with Bristol City and Sterling at Queens Park Rangers – only for their talent to be recognised by Newcastle and Liverpool respectively.

Aarons, like Sterling, is blessed with blistering pace and no shortage of skill.

He announced his arrival on the Premier League stage with a goal – a rare header – and an assist following his second-half introduction against Crystal Palace last weekend, only Wilfried Zaha’s injury-time strike denying him a match-winning cameo.

Already there is pressure on Alan Pardew to hand the teenager his first league start when domestic action resumes next weekend, but Aarons is a level-headed type guarded against getting carried away with his recent rise.

‘It’s been crazy,’ he said, ‘I’ve gone from under-21s football (at Newcastle) to the first team and to under-20s with England in no time.

‘But it’s not hard (to keep my feet on the ground), because it’s not my personality to get carried away with anything.

‘I like to take things in my stride and I’m quite humble.

‘I’m still in the reserve-team dressing room and that’s fine. My friends are in there and that’s cool.’

The Jamaican FA tried to persuade Aarons to opt for the country of his birth during the summer, and he admits it was a tough choice.

‘It wasn’t an easy decision, because I was born in Jamaica,’ he said. ‘But England is a big opportunity for me and I want to go out there and play and impress and show how good a player I am.

‘I’m buzzing. I can’t wait to go out and experience something new with England and I’ll be confident because I’m in a good place right now.’

On the call up, he added: ‘I was on the physio table getting a bit of treatment when someone came in with the papers. It was a complete shock and I didn’t know how to react to it. I’m happy and honoured.’

Aarons’ graduation to the senior set-up on Tyneside has even come as a surprise to Pardew and his backroom team. While undoubtedly talented, the youngster, much like Sterling, found it difficult to adjust to a move north aged only 16.

But two years under the guidance of former England legend Peter Beardsley has seen Aarons mature into the player of today.

‘When I first came here I found it mentally tough. It took me a while to adapt,’ he went on.

‘But after about a year and a half I stared to feel back to my old self, how I felt when I was younger.

‘The coaches and the manager have given me confidence and have worked with me day in, day out to help me be the player I want to be.

‘Peter Beardsley has helped me a lot. And Steve Stone has worked with me as well, and the gaffer too – they’ve all been brilliant.’

Aarons pointed to the name on the back of his shirt following his first senior goal last weekend.

‘I’m not big headed or anything,’ he said, ‘I just want people to recognise what I’m doing for this team and how much it means to be here.’

Remember the name: Rolando Aarons.
