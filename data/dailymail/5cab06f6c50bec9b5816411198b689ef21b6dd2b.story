One of the most iconic brands in existence, Cadbury’s distinctive purple and white logo has been a stalwart image on confectionery shelves across the UK for over a century - and never more so than at Easter.  

As the supermarkets and shops begin once again to overspill with chocolate chicks, bunnies and eggs in the run up to Good Friday, a historic set of pictures shows the evolution of the Cadbury’s Easter Egg.

From the very first dark chocolate egg made in 1875, to the birth of the crème egg in 1971, and today’s mass production of the popular milk chocolate egg, these photos give a fascinating insight into the development of one of our tastiest traditions.

Cadbury’s began in 1824 when John Cadbury opened a shop in Bull Street selling, among other things cocoa and drinking chocolate, which he prepared himself using a pestle and mortar.

The Cadbury manufacturing business was born in 1831, when John Cadbury decided to start producing on a commercial scale and bought a four-storey warehouse in nearby Crooked Lane.

Only a few years later in 1875 Cadbury produced their first Easter egg.

The earliest eggs were made with dark chocolate and had a smooth, plain surface. They were filled with sugar-coated chocolate drops known as 'dragees’.

The lid of the box is decorated with traditional imagery of Easter and you can glimpse similar floral designs on the egg itself

Later Easter eggs were decorated and had their plain shells enhanced with chocolate piping and marzipan flowers.

Cream-filled eggs first appeared back in 1923. But the Cadbury Creme Egg we know and love today didn’t hit the shelves until 1971.

Sales really took off in 1975, when Cadbury Creme Egg became a cult through the power of TV advertising.

The earliest eggs were made with dark chocolate and had a smooth, plain surface, but as can be seen in these Easter cards from 1914 they soon began to add decoration to them

First produced in 1971, about 1.5 million Cadbury Creme Egg eggs can now be made every day at the Bournville factory

The eggs are delivered to the trade for sale between January and Easter every year. About 1.5 million Cadbury Creme Egg eggs can be made every day at the Bournville factory. They’re made in two halves, both filled with white and one additionally filled with yellow fondant.

The two halves are closed together quickly and there it is - a Cadbury Creme Egg. With its milk chocolate shell, creme fondant and yellow 'yolk’ Cadbury Creme Egg is absolutely unique in the market, and over 200 million of them are sold in the UK every year.
