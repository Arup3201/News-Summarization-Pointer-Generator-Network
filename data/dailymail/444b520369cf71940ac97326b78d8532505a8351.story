BBC radio DJ Liz Kershaw has spoken out for the first time about claims she threatened a colleague who later killed himself.

Ms Kershaw, 55, was accused of leaving a series of threatening phone messages for colleague Russell Joslin, 50, who worked for BBC Coventry and Warwickshire radio, and suffocated himself in hospital 18 months ago.

An inquest into Mr Joslin's death heard he feared a complaint of sexual harassment he made against a colleague, later identified by Mr Joslin's father as Ms Kershaw, would spell the end of his career.

But today Ms Kershaw, who worked at BBC 
Coventry and Warwickshire between 2005 and 2011, gave her side of the 
story, saying: 'I understand why a grieving family looks for someone 
to blame.  But their troubled son's problems were not caused by
 me.'

Now a DJ at the digital station BBC Radio 6 Music, the mother-of-two said she became friends with Mr Joslin, a reporter at the station, when he asked her for career advice.  She said he was upset about his job, fearing he was going nowhere at work, and saying he didn't get on with colleagues.

Writing in her new book, The Bird and The Beeb, Ms Kershaw said she became friends with Mr Joslin and went out to lunch with him so often that colleagues joked about it.

But she said her friendship with him became strained when she had to cope with personal problems of her own, particularly a return of the cervical cancer she had got rid of a decade before.

In her book, serialised in the Mirror today, Ms Kershaw rebutted suggestions she might have sexually harrassed Mr Joslin, saying: 'I didn't have time or energy to deal with my colleague, never mind try to shag him as he claimed later.'

And she said he frightened her by taking her to a 'dogging' hotspot, where couples have sex in cars, watched by others, one evening after telling her he had a good local story.

Ms Kershaw said that Mr Joslin took her 
to some woods and told her what dogging was, but said the pair fled when
 a group of men walked towards their branded BBC car looking menacing.

As a result, she said, she asked him if he was wanting more than friendship from her, and said he replied rudely telling her if he was looking for a girlfriend, it would be one much younger than her.

Ms Kershaw admits in her autobiography that she 'probably' did leave him voice messages, because she was angry and upset by his behaviour.  She said he called her 'menopausal' and 'old', upsetting her so much that she ended their relationship for good.

But she insisted that she was not to blame for Mr Joslin's troubled state of mind or behaviour.

After Mr Joslin's death his father, former Warwickshire police chief Peter Joslin, named Ms Kershaw as the woman who made threatening phone calls to his son.

He said Russell Joslin was driven to his death after BBC bosses failed to take seriously allegations that he had been offended by a female colleague in 2007.

And Mr Joslin senior said he his son had recordings of 'very unpleasant' messages left by Ms Kershaw on his son's phone, branding him a 'flake' and a 'loser'.

The former police chief said shortly after his son's death: 'They were very unpleasant and she made it clear that she felt she was on a different level to him. 

'A lot of things happened because he had to carry on working with her. He did not tell us everything but it badly affected him.

Ms Kershaw, who worked for Radio 1 in the Eighties, claimed last year that there was a culture of sexual harassment of women at Radio 1, and said she had been groped while working there.

Her claims about abuse at the BBC triggered a new Commons inquiry into the shelving of the Jimmy Savile sex abuse investigation.

Born in Rochdale, Lancashire in 1958, Liz Kershaw - the sister of fellow broadcaster Andy Kershaw - began her media career in Leeds with a column in the Yorkshire Post.

In 1984 she and her neighbour, Carol Vorderman, formed their own band, Dawn Chorus and the Bluetits, with another friend, Lindsay Forrest.

The following year she began presenting a weekly rock show for BBC Radio Leeds, before moving to London the following year and devising her own show, Backchat, for BBC Radio 1 in 1987.

Ms Kershaw then presented the Radio 1 Evening Show, Radio 1's Weekend Breakfast Show with Bruno Brookes, and the Radio 1 Roadshow from 1989 to 1992.

In 1992 Ms Kershaw moved to BBC Radio 5, where she worked until 2000 when she moved into local radio.

She joined BBC Coventry and Warwickshire in 2005, and worked there until 2011.  She now presents a regular show on digital station, BBC Radio 6 Music.
