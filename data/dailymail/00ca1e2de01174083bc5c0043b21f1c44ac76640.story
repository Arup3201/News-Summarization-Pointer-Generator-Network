Crazy in love: Ramsey Fakhouri tried to make the ultimate romantic gesture by buying his girlfriend an engagement ring, but chose to pay for it by robbing his lover's bank - and now he is starting a six-year jail term

A love-struck robber raided the bank where his girlfriend worked on Valentine's Day in a bid to pay for her engagement ring - only for her to turn him in to police.

Separated by hundreds of miles between his Detroit-area home and that of his Illinois would-be fiancee, Ramsey Fakhouri figured he would make the long-distance romance work by getting his sweetheart a diamond.

But his choice of committing an armed robbery to make his amorous gesture has instead landed him in jail.

The 22-year-old was sentenced in East St Louis, Illinois to six and a half years for his role in the hold-up last Valentine’s Day of a female worker who was restocking an automated teller machine outside the bank where his girlfriend was working.

Federal prosecutors say Fakhouri, of Troy, shared with 18-year-old accomplice Alexander Gerth the $26,000 stolen during the heist.

Fakhouri’s girlfriend watched the robbery unfold in horror, never knowing her beau — the one who hours later comforted her about what she saw — had such a hand in it.

Authorities say in court documents that the romance began a couple of years ago when Fakhouri met the girlfriend at a Bible college.

By early this year, Fakhouri was ready to ask her to be his wife, but lacked a way to pay for an engagement ring.

Before last February 14, while talking with his girlfriend by telephone, Fakhouri put her on speaker phone so Gerth could hear her unwittingly give details how the ATM is restocked outside her Bradford National Bank branch in Highland, Illinois, east of St. Louis.

Equipped with pellet guns resembling real semi-automatic pistols, authorities say, the Michigan friends drove Fakhouri’s 2008 Ford Mustang through the night to southern Illinois — getting a $120 speeding ticket along the way — and waited outside the bank for it to open.

At one point, he watched the girlfriend pull onto the bank’s lot to start her shift.

She even called to wish Fakhouri a good morning, unaware he was there.

About 8.30am, prosecutors say that Gerth — masked and wielding the pellet gun — robbed the branch manager after she came out to refill the drive-up ATM.

The girlfriend's reaction likely shattered any illusion Fakhouri may have had of pursuing a Bonnie-and-Clyde style criminal romance like the infamous lovers (above) who looted banks across America in the 1930s

With Fakhouri driving the getaway car, the two suspects fled and were returning to Michigan when Fakhouri’s girlfriend texted him, voicing fears about the robbery she’d just seen.

Fakhouri later told investigators Gerth dropped him off in Indianapolis, and he took a Greyhound bus back to comfort his girlfriend.

Later, after the girlfriend received texted surveillance photos of the alleged bank robbers visiting a Walmart near the robbed bank, Fakhouri admitted to her that one of the images was of him and she told police.

Her reaction likely shattered any illusion he may have had of pursuing a Bonnie-and-Clyde style criminal romance like the infamous lovers who looted banks across America in the 1930s.

Gerth, arrested in Michigan three days after the hold-up, pleaded guilty in April and awaits sentencing next month.
