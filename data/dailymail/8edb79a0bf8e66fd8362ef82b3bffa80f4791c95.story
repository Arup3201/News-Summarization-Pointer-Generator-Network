Mayor Bill de Blasio has slammed a group of NYPD officers as 'disrespectful' for turning their backs to him during a pair of funerals for slain police officers.

In his first remarks on the officers' protests, De Blasio said that the actions were hurtful to the families of the two cops killed in an ambush last month. 

The public rebuke, he said on Monday, was an offense to the city at large.

Police Commissioner William Bratton also condemned their actions.

'Direspectful': De Blasio today condemned officers who turned their back on him at the funeral of an officer shot dead by a gunman who said he was taking revenge for the death of Eric Garner

Defiant: The mass protest on Sunday came despite an appeal not to from Commissioner Bratton 

'I can't understand why': De Blasio slammed the back-turning as an offense against the entire city 

The mayor, speaking to reporters at 1 Police Plaza, said he appreciated that many officers did not turn their backs.

However, he is 'disappointed' by 'some individual officers' who did turn their backs.

'They were disrespectful to the families involved,' de Blasio said. 

'They were disrespectful to the families who had lost their loved ones. I can't understand why anyone would do such a thing in the context like that.' 

The rift between the police unions and de Blasio has created the biggest crisis of his mayoralty. 

The unions have blamed de Blasio for fostering an anti-NYPD atmosphere they believe contributed to the murders of the officers.

Thousands of police turned their backs on Sunday as  de Blasio eulogized an officer shot dead with his partner, repeating a stinging display of scorn for the mayor despite entreaties to put anger aside.

The show of disrespect came outside the funeral home where Officer Wenjian Liu was remembered as an incarnation of the American dream: a man who had emigrated from China at age 12 and devoted himself to helping others in his adopted country.

His young widow Pei Xia Chen, who married Liu just months earlier, paid a tearful tribute at the funeral, saying she had lost her 'soul mate' and a 'wonderful husband'.

'Wenjian will always be in my heart. I love you, I love you forever,' she told him.

'We spoke about work often and how much respect he had for the law, how he applied the law... with courtesy, with respect and with the highest professionalism.' 

The gesture among officers watching the mayor's speech on a screen added to tensions between the mayor and rank-and-file police even as he sought to quiet them.

'Let us move forward by strengthening the bonds that unite us, and let us work together to attain peace,' de Blasio said at the funeral. 

Last Saturday, the New York City Police Department buried a hero.

Tens of thousands of officers from our department and hundreds of other departments came to show respect for detective first grade Rafael Ramos.

His family witnessed the kind of love that only his second family in blue could display.

But for the last seven days, the city's and the country's consciousness of that funeral has focused on an act of disrespect shown by a portion of those tens of thousands of officers.

It was not all the officers, and it was not disrespect directed at Detective Ramos.

But all the officers were painted by it, and it stole the valor, honor, and attention that rightfully belonged to the memory of Detective Rafael Ramos's life and sacrifice.

That was not that intent, I know. But it was the result.

On Sunday, we will gather together again, with the rest of New York City and law-enforcement officials nationwide, to mourn for Detective First Grade Wenjian Liu.

We gather to support his parents, his widow, and everyone who is there to remember a life tragically cut short.

The assassination of Detectives Liu and Ramos was an attack on us all.

As a cop, one who lived and worked through the assassination threats of the 1970s, I understand that emotions are high.

I issue no mandates, and I make no threats of discipline.

But I remind you that when you don the uniform of this department, you are bound by the tradition, honor, and decency that go with it.
