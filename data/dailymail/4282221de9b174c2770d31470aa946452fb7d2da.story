A depressed 53-year-old stockbroker hanged himself in his father-in-law’s home while his wife and children went to watch the Paralympics, an inquest heard yesterday.

Andrew Heath waved off his wife and four children at a London Underground station in September as they travelled to the Games and headed back to his in-law’s house in Chelsea, south-west London.

He had told his wife Camilla that he was going to fly to Scotland for a friend’s birthday, but he instead went into the basement bathroom of the home and hanged himself.

Mr Heath had moved with his family from Shepton Mallet, Somerset, to the three-storey home of Mrs Heath’s parents, Westminster Coroners’ Court heard yesterday.

He had suffered from depression but had apparently made a recovery despite the ‘stressful’ nature of his job.

Mr Heath’s father-in-law, Jonathon Fry, said: ‘Camilla went to the Paralympics and arrived back about 6pm. Andrew was meant to be on the plane to Scotland to attend a friend’s birthday party.

Recording an open verdict, Coroner Dr 
Fiona Cox said she did not believe it was an accident but could not be 
certain he intended to kill himself.

She
said: ‘Andrew Heath was only 53 years old. At the time he had a past 
history of depression for which he received some treatment.

‘Within the last few months, his wife thought he was suffering from a recurrence. During the week he worked in the city.

‘On that morning, he had taken his wife to the Tube station, kissed them goodbye and seen them off. The family arrived home about 6pm and went to a restaurant. Around 8.30pm that evening, they arrived back at the house.

‘His wife entered the bathroom first and touched his arm but Mr Heath was clearly deceased. There was no suicide note.’

She added the death was not suspicious, giving the cause as compression of the neck before recording an open verdict.

‘He was unusually quiet. I last saw 
him at 9am on September 1 when he was about to fly to Scotland. In the 
last few months he had not been getting on with his wife.’

Mr Heath, head of sales for stockbroker firm Oriel Securities in central London, was discovered later that evening by his wife.

Mrs Heath said: ‘We had been married since 1999. There had been a few issues recently but we had been trying to work out our relationship.

‘We travelled to my father’s house, we all had dinner together. 

‘There had never been any arguments to suggest he would do something like this. That day we all went out for Chinese.’

She added that he had suffered from depression four or five years ago, but it had apparently got better - despite his ‘stressful job’.

PC Patrick Marshall, who attended the scene, said: ‘There was no third party involvement. We found no alcohol or drugs and his phone showed a missed call from his wife. The death was non-suspicious.’

The coroner recorded an open verdict.
