Carole Waugh boasted about socialising with Colonel Gaddafi and his children, her brother said in court

A millionairess call girl who was allegedly murdered by two conmen boasted about socialising with Colonel Gaddafi and his children, a court heard yesterday.

Carole Waugh, a former oil executive who went under the name ‘poshtottyfun’ on an escort site, told her brother she was close to the Libyan dictator’s family while working as a oil firm clerk in Tripoli.

But Christopher Waugh claimed his sister, who was said to be lonely and looking for love, often ‘embroidered’ stories to make her seem happier than she was.

The 49-year-old disappeared in April 
last year, four months before her badly decomposed body was found in the
boot of a car in a South London lock-up.

Nicholas
Kutner, 48, and Rakesh Bhayani, 41, allegedly murdered her so they 
could strip her assets using a team of female impersonators to fund 
their gambling addictions and appetite for high living.

Speaking
at the Old Bailey yesterday, Mr Waugh, a bank manager for Barclays, 
told the court: ‘She was always dropping names. She led me to believe 
she was very close to Gaddafi’s family and rubbed shoulders with some of
the sons and daughters. She would bring the family into conversations. I
took it with a pinch of salt.’

Orlando
Pownall QC, representing Bhayani, asked: ‘When she told you she had met
members of Gaddafi’s family, socialising with him, you didn’t believe 
it?’

‘No definitely not’, 
said Mr Waugh. ‘The stories were embroidered and exaggerated to give an 
impression she was more successful than she was and happier than she 
was.’

He added that she was ‘very interested in money’.

He
said he last saw his sister, who lived alone in a £600,000 flat in 
Marylebone, West London, when she visited from April 6 to 9 last year.

Christopher Waugh told the court he took his sister's stories about the Gaddafi family with 'a pinch of salt'

But after she failed to respond to calls and emails, he filed a missing persons report in May.

Her
mother Margaret Waugh, who died two months ago, said in a police 
statement that Miss Waugh was ‘obsessed about money’. She added: ‘If she
bought something she would always say how much it was. Carole was slim 
with a smashing figure. Whenever Carole would come and visit I would 
feel like I was on holiday. She would  take us on outings.’

The
court heard that after allegedly stabbing Miss Waugh, the two men 
celebrated by splashing out on ‘expensive girls’, luxury hotel rooms and
gambling in casinos.

They 
are said to have stashed the body in a holdall in the boot of a VW Golf.
Meanwhile, a person posing as Miss Waugh was sent to buy handbags worth
more than £5,000 from Chanel and Selfridges using the victim’s 
Barclaycard, it is claimed.

Prosecutor
Patrick Gibbs QC said that on 20 April last year – four days after the 
killing – Bhayani and Kutner decided to treat themselves.

He
added: ‘By the end of the day they are celebrating. The killing must 
have been bloody and dramatic but now Carole Waugh’s body is out of 
sight in a holdall in the boot of an anonymous car.

Nicholas Kutner (centre) and Rakesh Bhayani (right), who are accused of murdering wealthy escort Carole Waugh, celebrated by spending money on prostitutes and luxury hotel rooms, the Old Bailey was told. Elie Khoury (left) denies one count of conspiracy to defraud

‘They
were transferring money between bank accounts at will. An impersonator 
has successfully used the Barclaycard, they have got daily pocket money 
from the ATMs and plenty of money for all the gambling and expensive 
girls they wanted.

‘That night they splashed out.’

Kutner
went out for the night with a student who needed help with her fees and
then booked into a luxury hotel, while Bhayani also checked into an 
opulent hotel.

The next day Kutner took the student to casinos and lost a large amount of money, jurors were told.

‘It had been a stressful few days for these men but they allowed themselves a little reward,’ he added.

Kutner and Bhayani both deny murder but admit conspiracy to defraud. The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
