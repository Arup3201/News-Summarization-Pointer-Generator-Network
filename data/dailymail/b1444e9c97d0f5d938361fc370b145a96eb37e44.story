One Britain's most famous police units has had its numbers slashed because felons are giving up on old-fashioned bank robberies.

The Metropolitan Police's Flying Squad, which deals with bank heists and armed robberies, has had half of its bases closed and shed almost 50 officers as criminals turn to online theft instead.

Flying Squad, nicknamed the Sweeney, was once faced with an onslaught of major robberies, which peaked in 1992 with 291 raids in London alone.

Obsolete? The Met Police's Flying Squad, as portrayed above in 1970s drama The Sweeney, has had its numbers slashed by almost a third in just one year

Not like the old days: The cuts come as criminals shun traditional bank robberies, once staple fare of Flying Squad officers, such as those shown by John Thaw  Dennis Waterman above

That year there were 847 raids nationwide, a figure which has plummeted since.

The latest data from the British Bankers' Association, for 2012, show 108 branch robberies, 26 of which were in London.

And the decline looks set to continue, with Flying Squad officers investigating 33 bank robberies in the 2013/14 financial year, just five per cent of their total workload.

As a result, officer numbers have been cut from 112 to 160, two of their four bases closed, and the whole unit folded in to a large organised and economic crime command. 

The squad was made famous in the 1970s by ITV series The Sweeney, starring John Thaw as Detective Inspector Jack Regan, and Dennis Waterman as Detective Sergeant George Carter.

Real-life Flying Squad officers helped investigate some of Britain's most notorious criminals, including the Kray twins and the gang behind the Great Train Robbery.

Heist no more: The number of bank robberies reported each year has fallen from a high of 847 nationwide in 1992 to barely more than 100 in 2012

Perhaps their finest hour came in 2000, when a diamond raid on the Millennium Dome was dramatically foiled by 140 officers.

A gang of robbers smashed a JCB digger into the dome, intending to make off with the fabulous £200million Millennium Star, along with 11 other fine diamonds.

They were armed with smoke bombs, ammonia knock-out gas and nailguns to break through high-security glass.

Their plan was then to flee the dome via speedboat and, police believe, sell on their takings to mafia bosses. 

But
 Flying Squad had been tipped off, replaced the gems with fakes and lay 
in wait for the raid on November 7. All the robbers and accomplices were
 captured, while CCTV cameras captured every moment.

Now, however, criminals are turning to less dramatic, but equally costly, raids carried out through cyberspace.

Earlier this year gang leader Tony Colston-Hayter was jailed after admitting a raid at a Barclays bank in northwest London.

But rather than guns and getaway cars, the robbery was carried out using a keyboard video mouse - a device which he used to hijack the bank's computers and siphon off £1.3million.

It comes as anti-fraud agencies report a resurgence of thefts using bank card data - with £450million stolen from British cards through a combination of identity theft, cloned cards, computer viruses and internet scams in 2013.

The figure had shot up 16 per cent since 2012, approaching its all-time peak from 2006.

Online banking fraud has also increased to £40.9 million, up from £39.6 million in 2012.

Bank card fraud is on the increase, with losses on British cards totalling £450.4 million last year, a 16 per cent rise on 2012. Online banking fraud increased by 3 per cent to £40.9 million, up from £39.6 million in 2012. 

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'The last 12 months have seen the Met undergo significant changes as we seek to modernise the services we provide the public whilst making essential savings.'
