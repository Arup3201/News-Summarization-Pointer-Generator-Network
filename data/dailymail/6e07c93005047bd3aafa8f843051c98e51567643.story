Freak accident: The woman's car slipped into reverse as she got out to deliver a newspaper

A Canadian woman was left seriously injured after being run over by her own car three times as she tried to deliver newspapers.

Residents of Trois-Rivieres were woken by the woman's anguished cries as she was repeatedly struck by her car in a bizarre accident.

The woman had been making her regular newspaper delivery in Trois-Rivieres earlier this week, when her automatic car slipped into reverse as she got out.Â 

As she got out of the car, it lurched backwards and the open car door knocked her under the wheels.

The
 woman, who has not been named, tried to pull herself back into the car 
to stop it, but she stumbled and was run over for a second time.

A third attempt to get back in her car resulted in the injured driver being pulled under the car for a third time.

Her car continued to move in an ever-widening circle until the police arrived.

Alerted
 by the woman's cries, residents rushed outside to drag her to safety.

She was taken to hospital to be treated for a serious leg injury.

With their help she was able to limp to a nearby house to wait for 
medical attention.

It is believed the woman, had been delivering the French-language newspaper  Le Nouvelliste at the time of the accident, confused 'park' and 'reverse' on her gear box as she got out of the car.

Because she had left the engine running, the car continued to move until police were able to stop it.
