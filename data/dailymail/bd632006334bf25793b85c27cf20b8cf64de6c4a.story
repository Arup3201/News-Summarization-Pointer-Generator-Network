However authorities have not released how 62-year-old Joan Colbert and Veronica Roach were killed.

Shocking: Veronica Roach, 10 (left), and Joan Colbert, 62 (right), were found at their home in Long Branch, New Jersey on Friday night. Their deaths are being investigated as a homicide

On the first-floor of the Lippincott Ave house police found the mother and daughter murdered.

However the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office have said they have no reason to believe there is a threat to community.

Colbert's twin sister, Lorraine Colbert, identified the bodies, according to the Ashbury Park Press.

She said Colbert had been raising the little girl since she three months old.

'(She) was my mother, my sister, my grandmother,' Lorraine Colbert told the newspaper.

'She was my all-in-all, my everything.'

The victim's brother, said he had gotten a call at work saying his sister was dead.

'She would do anything for anyone,' he said.

Linda Smith of Long Branch, who graduated high school with Colbert, said was disabled and did not work.

'I can't even begin to imagine what happened,' Smith said.

'She was such a good, outgoing person.

'She raised that child. I can't even imagine how this happened.'

Suspicious circumstances: Police were called to the home in Lippincott Ave, Long Branch, where they found the bodies. The house is on a quiet family-oriented street

Prosecutors have appealed for help in solving the case.

'There are people out there that know something,' office spokesman Charles Webster told .

'Anything that may help, no matter how small it is, any and all information.'

Flowers and gifts have started to appear outside the home.

The homicide comes nearly a year and a half after a couple were found murdered in a nearby home.

The pair had been stabbed to death in Sairs Avenue.

No arrests have been made in that case as of Sunday.

Authorities are asking anyone with information to contact prosecutor's office Detective Richard Chapman at 732-577-8700 or Long Branch police Detective Ross Zotti at 732-222-1000.
