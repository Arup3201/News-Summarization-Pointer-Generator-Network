If Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie ever tire of making movies, a career in wine-making looms.

The glamorous showbiz couple have just released their rosé wine, Chateau
Miraval, made from grapes grown at their £35 million estate in the 
South of France – and it has already sold out in the UK.

The wine – priced at £18.95 a bottle – was sold by Berry Bros & 
Rudd, which counts the Queen and Prince Charles among its clients. The 
company has requested more stock.

The A-listers bought the 17th-century estate for £35million. One of the reasons they chose it is because it has a working vineyard

In March, the first 6,000 bottles of the wine sold out within five hours
of being offered online in France.

Berry Bros buyer Simon Field told 
Harpers Wine & Spirits Trade Review: ‘The couple have, by all 
accounts, been fairly hands-on and are extremely pleased with the 
results – as are we.’

Pitt, 49, and Jolie, 38, are planning more wines, with a white to be 
released this summer and a red next year.

Their 1,000-acre estate near 
the village of Correns has 150 acres planted in grapes.

The estate: The 1,200-acre property, Chateau Miraval, already grows enough grapes for 150,000 bottles of wine

The news came in the run-up to Brangelina's wedding which will take place at Chateau Miraval. The picturesque estate even has its own Romanesque chapel, where the couple plan to exchange vows.
