Australia's top female criminal prosecutor, Margaret Cunneen, will not face a scheduled inquiry by corruption body ICAC due to start on Monday, as a judge has delayed her bid to have the probe into allegations of perverting the course of justice halted.

The corruption watchdog was due to open its three-day inquiry into the silk on Monday over allegations she and her son Stephen Wyllie told his girlfriend Sophia Tilley to fake chest pains to avoid a breath test after a car crash in May.

After the allegations were aired, Ms Cunneen sought urgent action in the Supreme Court to shut the inquiry down.

But Justice Cliff Hoeben said on Friday that he was unable to hand down a decision before the weekend, standing it over until Monday at 2pm.

ICAC barrister Jeremy Kirk SC initially said the commission would be willing to hold off launching its hearing until 3pm on Monday - an hour after Justice Hoeben's expected decision.

Top prosecutor: Lawyers for Margaret Cunneen, SC, a familiar figure in Sydney courts prosecuting gang rapists and murderers, have taken action against corruption body ICAC over claims she instructed her son's girlfriend to fake chest pains to beat a drink driving breath test

Keep private life private: Margaret Cunneen, who has launched the court action with her son Stephen Wyllie and his girlfriend, Sophia Tilley (both pictured, above) contends that the corruption body has no business investigating matters concerning her private life

'I think we have to be sensible and mature. There shouldn't be a rush,' he told the court.

Once the decision was handed down on Monday, it was likely either party would appeal it, he said.

Following a short break, Mr Kirk said the commission "would not commence the public hearing prior to 10am on Tuesday".

Meanwhile, it was announced on Friday that Ms Cunneen had been elected to the NSW Bar Association's governing body, the Bar Council.

In a show of support by her colleagues, the 55-year-old deputy senior crown prosecutor garnered the second-highest number of votes with 387 nods, behind Jane Needham SC's 441.

Speaking outside court, Mr Moses said his client 'certainly got good support from members of the bar in terms of the vote'.

Mr Moses has previously attacked the ICAC's pursuit of Ms Cunneen, saying the watchdog had gone beyond its jurisdiction.

But Mr Kirk said the ICAC had a duty to investigate allegations she had perverted the course of justice because she was a public official.

On Thursday, Ms Cunneen's counsel told the court  ICAC had no business investigating her private life.

Ms Cunneen launched the urgent action along with Stephen Wyllie, 26 and 25-year-old girlfriend, Ms Tilley.

Arthur Moses, QC, that just because she holds public office doesn't mean she loses ' the rights of any other citizen when a matter arises in their personal life which has nothing to do with their public function'.

He said neither Ms Cunneen nor any other public official including 'dog catchers and rangers' should lose their rights as private citizens.

 He said Ms Cunneen's role as deputy senior crown prosecutor was 'irrelevant' in the case of the car crash investigation.

'You have a state body making a decision impacting on the rights of citizens,' he said.

Seeking documents: Margaret Cunneen, SC, has sought documents tracing the origin of the 'malicious complaint' which  landed her before a now delayed ICAC hearing

Since the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) launched action against Ms Cunneen last week, the widely respected NSW deputy senior Crown prosecutor has received a groundswell of support from senior figures in the Australian legal fraternity.

 The ICAC hearing to investigate allegations of perverting the course of justice against Ms Cunneen is due to begin next Monday.

The action, which has been described as a 'witch hunt',  could 'only be the result of a malicious complaint', the 55-year-old mother of three sons told Daily Mail Australia.

Ms Cunneen launched her Supreme Court action on Tuesday to challenge the ICAC's power to investigate the claim, and to seek documents and a copy of the 'allegation or complaint' which set off the Commission's investigation into Ms Cunneen, her son and Ms Tilley. 

Mr Moses asked Justice Clifton Hoeben to eject ICAC from an active presence in the court proceedings, arguing it 'endangers the impartiality' of the Commission to rule in the looming hearing against Ms Cunneen.

'If the Commission becomes the protagonist it endangers their impartiality in subsequent hearings,' Mr Moses said.

He said Ms Cunneen and her fellow applicants were demanding ICAC's reasons for mounting the investigation in the first place.

'They don't have any get out of jail free card,' he said, 'they are accountable like anybody else.'

But counsel for ICAC, Mr Kirk, said the Commission would resist explaining in court as to why the charges of perverting the course of justice had been laid.

Mr Moses is seeking an order restraining the ICAC from taking further steps in relation to the investigation, the reasons why the action was taken, and a declaration that the commission is acting outside its jurisdiction.

The car crash at the centre of the ICAC claims happened on May 31, when Ms Tilley, 25, was driving Ms Cunneen's Ford Mondeo and she was hit by another vehicle in Willoughby, on Sydney's north shore. The Mondeo was knocked onto its side and Ms Tilley was trapped in her seat belt for some time.

Daily Mail Australia understands once Ms Tilley was freed from the vehicle she called her boyfriend Mr Wyllie, who called his father Greg Wyllie. Mr Wyllie snr then told Ms Cunneen. Ms Tilley, who has breast implants, reported experiencing chest pain at the scene. There was some fear the implants may have ruptured.

 The two Wyllies arrived at the accident scene on foot. By the time Ms Cunneen arrived by car Ms Tilley was in an ambulance. She was taken to Royal North Shore Hospital where a blood test showed no alcohol in her system.

Ms Tilley was not at fault in the accident.

Daily Mail Australia has revealed that ICAC investigators seized the mobile telephones of Ms Cunneen, Mr Wyllie and Ms Tilley in unannounced morning raids at their respective homes two months after the accident, on July 30.

Until that day, none of the trio was aware of any investigation into events following the crash, which happened in May. Mr Wyllie and Ms Tilley were subsequently called to private ICAC hearings in August.

Since ICAC Launched its action, there has been an outcry from legal figures including former NSW State cabinet head, Professor Gary Sturgess, that the matter should have been investigated by police.

Justice Hoeben has previously ruled against Margaret Cunneen, in 2007 when she was prosecuting in the retrial of convicted gang rapist Bilal Skaf.

One of three judges on the Court of Criminal Appeal, Justice Hoeben ruled Ms Cunneen should not participate in the retrial because she had made public  statements about the case of Skaf and his fellow gang rapists which would compromise 'appropriate fairness and detachment'.

In a separate action, the acting Inspector of the ICAC, prominent former Supreme Court judge David Levine, QC, announced he was conducting an audit into the Commission's action against Ms Cunneen.
