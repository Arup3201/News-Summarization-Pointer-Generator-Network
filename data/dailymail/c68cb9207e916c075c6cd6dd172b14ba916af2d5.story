The last words from the cockpit of the missing Malaysia Airlines plane before it disappeared were actually 'Good night, Malaysian three seven zero,' not 'All right, good night' as Malaysian authorities had previously claimed.

It is not clear whether the sign off was said by Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah or his co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid, but it was transmitted as the plane left Malaysian airspace and was about to enter that of Vietnam at 1.19am on March 8.

The cause of the discrepancy is unclear, but for three weeks it was reported that 'All right, good night' had been said by co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid two minutes before the planeâ€™s transponder was shut down.

The statement added that the full transcript'will be made available during the briefing to the next-of-kin of passengers on board the flight, which disappeared on March 8

Today the Department of Civil Aviation in a short statement: 'We would like to confirm
 that the last conversation in the transcript between the air traffic 
controller and the cockpit is at 0119 (Malaysian Time) and is 'Good 
night Malaysian three seven zero.'

'The
 authorities are still doing forensic investigation to determine whether
 those last words from the cockpit were by the pilot or the co-pilot,' 
said the statement.

The statement added that acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein 'has instructed the investigating team to release the full transcript' which will be made available during the briefing to the next-of-kin of passengers on board the flight, which disappeared on March 8.

Today it was announced that Malaysia Prime Minister Najib Razak will visit Australia to witness the race-against-time bid to locate a crash site for flight MH370, as a ship equipped to pinpoint its 'black box' prepared to steam to the search area.

Ships and planes from seven nations scanned a vast zone far off western Australia for yet another day, but the hunt for debris that would prove the Malaysia Airlines jet crashed in the Indian Ocean more than three weeks ago turned up nothing.

'The prime minister, who is going to Perth on Wednesday, will be briefed fully on how things have been conducted, and probably will be discussing what are the chances ahead,' Malaysian Transport and Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters in Kuala Lumpur.

Experts warn debris must be found within days to nail down a crash site in order for any use of the US-supplied black box detector - known as a towed pinger locator (TPL) - to be feasible.

The US Navy, which has supplied the detection device, said in a statement Monday: 'Without confirmation of debris it will be virtually impossible to effectively employ the TPL since the range on the black-box pinger is only about a mile.'

But Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said earlier in the day no time limit would be imposed on the search for clues as to what happened.

'We owe it to the families, we owe it to everyone that travels by air, we owe it to the anxious governments of the countries who had people on that aircraft. We owe it to the wider world which has been transfixed by this mystery for three weeks now,' Abbott said in Perth.

The Boeing 777 carrying 239 people vanished without a trace on March 8 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, leaving stunned relatives, the aviation industry, and ordinary travellers around the world hanging on the mystery.

Drawing a blank: A Chinese aircraft returns to Perth International Airport after searching for the missing jet

Families of Chinese passengers have angrily attacked Malaysia, alleging incompetence and deceit in what even Malaysian officials call the 'unprecedented' loss of a jumbo jet.

More than a dozen Chinese relatives - part of a group of nearly 30 who arrived on the weekend to press for answers - kept up the pressure after a prayer session Monday at a Kuala Lumpur Buddhist temple.

'We will never forgive those who hurt our families and don't tell the truth and delay the rescue mission,' a spokesman for the group, Jiang Hui, told reporters, reiterating suspicions toward Malaysia voiced by many relatives of the 153 Chinese aboard.

The Australian vessel Ocean Shield, fitted with the pinger locator and an underwater drone designed to home in on the black box's signal, was to conduct sea trials off Perth on Monday before heading to the search area.

Mr Abbott said his main reason for visiting the RAAF base was to thank the personnel who have come to help with the search. He is pictured here shaking hands with China's Air Force Senior Colonel Liu Dianjun, head of China's effort to locate the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370

A black box signal usually lasts only about 30 days. Fears are mounting that time will run out - Ocean Shield will not reach the search zone, now the size of Norway, until Thursday, Hishammuddin said, roughly 26 days after the plane went missing.

If floating MH370 debris is found, authorities plan to analyse recent weather patterns and ocean currents to determine where the plane went down.

Malaysia believes MH370 was deliberately diverted by someone on board and that satellite data indicates it crashed in the remote Indian Ocean.

Monday's search saw ten planes take to the skies, with ten ships already at sea. Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, Malaysia, South Korea and the US are taking part.

Malaysia remains officially in charge, but Australia has assumed increasing responsibility, appointing retired air chief marshal Angus Houston to head a new coordination centre in Perth.

Many Chinese relatives, still holding out slim hopes, have taken issue with Najib's March 24 announcement that the plane was lost at sea, despite the lack of firm evidence.

Hishammuddin said 'high-level' Malaysian officials and experts involved in an investigation into MH370 would brief families simultaneously in Kuala Lumpur and Beijing 'soon' in a bid to explain Malaysia's stance.

Malaysia insists it is being transparent, but is yet to release any details of its investigation into what happened, which has included probing the backgrounds of everyone on the flight, including its crew.

Chinese aircraft spotted three new objects floating off the western coast of Australia, as they scoured the new search area today. The items were said to be red, orange and white - similar to the colours of a Malaysia Airlines jet. This picture shows a suspected item of debris highlighted

In testy exchanges with foreign journalists Monday, Hishammuddin said: 'We are not hiding anything, we are just following the procedure that has been set.'

Malaysia also has come under fire from China's state media, while Beijing has pressed for more transparency in the investigation. Authorities there allowed angry relatives to stage a rare protest last week at Malaysia's embassy.

But a commentary in the government-controlled China Daily struck a more measured tone Monday, urging relatives to accept their losses.

'Although the Malaysian government's handling of the crisis has been quite clumsy, we need to understand this is perhaps the most bizarre incident in Asian civil aviation history,' it said.
