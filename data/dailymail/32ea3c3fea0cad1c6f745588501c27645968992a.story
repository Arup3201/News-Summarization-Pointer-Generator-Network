Convicted murderer: Craig Black absconded from HMP Leyhill in South Gloucestershire on Monday

Hundreds of criminals - including more than a dozen murderers - are on the run in England and Wales after absconding, figures revealed today.

Authorities admit they are unsure of the whereabouts of more than 800 missing prisoners, including 15 killers serving life sentences.

A Freedom of Information Act response to The Times said rapists and other violent criminals were also counted among those at large.

The figures revealed a total of 821 prisoners are currently unaccounted for, despite having broken the terms of their parole and being recalled to custody at least 12 months ago.

It is estimated that nearly 400 of those who have absconded have fled abroad, while two criminals are thought to have died, the newspaper said.

The figures state nearly 500 breached their parole after failing to stay in touch with the Probation Service, while 33 were recalled to face further charges.

A Prison Service spokesman said: ‘In more than 99 per cent of cases where an offender has been recalled, the individual has been successfully returned to custody.

‘Where an offender flees the country and their whereabouts are known, the UK does everything it can to return them to custody.’

Javed Khan, chief executive of Victim Support, told The 
Times: 'Disturbing figures like these do nothing to increase public 
confidence in the ability of the criminal justice system to punish 
offenders and keep people safe.'

Meanwhile Avon and Somerset Police are hunting a convicted murderer who absconded from an open prison earlier this week.

Craig Black, who was jailed for life in 1995, left HMP Leyhill in South Gloucestershire on Monday. He had only been transferred to the prison this month.

The force is warning the public not to approach Black, who it said has links with Marlborough, Wiltshire and Birmingham.

‘He was last seen at 4.45pm Monday afternoon,’ a police spokesman said. ‘There was a further check at 8.30pm when it was discovered that he was missing.

‘We are keen to trace him and would urge anyone spotting him to contact us on 999. We would urge members of the public not to approach Craig Black.’

The hunt for Black comes after Hertfordshire Constabulary officers were engaged in a major manhunt for Ian McLoughlin, who was wanted in connection with the death of Graham Buck, 66, on Saturday.

McLoughlin is suspected of a fatal
attack after he was allowed out of jail on day release. Police found him at a London address at 1am today and he was arrested.
