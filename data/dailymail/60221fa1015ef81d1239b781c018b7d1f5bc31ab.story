Unveiled with great and solemn self-importance, after a teaser shot of a pair of scissors and a comb on Instagram, here is the essential haircut for 2015.

Cheryl Fernandez-Versini — pop starlet turned X Factor Judge — yesterday revealed she has had her image-defining mane of long extensions snipped off.

‘Long overdue!’ she sighed on Twitter.

Snap! Cheryl may have tucked her hair behind her ear, but doesn't her new bob look very familiar? Victoria Beckham wore it first, back in 2007

So Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has chopped off her long locks.

We imagine people will be frantically calling up salons and asking for a new hairdo on a scale not seen since the Nineties phenomenon that was 'The Rachel'...

But we wouldn't be surprised if the singer and X Factor judge took such drastic action just so she could show off the back of this dress in all its glory! She was filming for the Graham Norton show and even though her stylist Anna Hughes-Chamberlain only gave us a sneak peak of the back of the dress, they don't call us Fashion Finder for nothing you know!

A bit of investigative work revealed that this dress is by Proenza Schouler and we love the woven texture, high neck and button detailing. The front is super chic, but of course thanks to that cut out it's even better from the back! And the best news is that this dress is now hugely reduced at The Outnet, so click (right) to get your hands on it.

What remains, after the attentions of her regular hair stylist Paul Percival, is a neat, layered bob, with some backcombing around the crown and shorter layers cut into the nape of the neck.

Considering that she is the face of beauty giant L’Oreal, who pay her around £250,000 a year to promote their hair products, the restyle is a bold move.

And you can bet that the new look will have an influence on the High Street, as Cheryl, now 31, is idolised by thousands.

They may not buy her albums (her last release only managed to reach No. 7 in the charts before dropping back down), but they do buy her image.

However, if imitation really is the sincerest form of flattery, then Cheryl must have a serious crush herself — on one Victoria Beckham.

For, it turns out, that where the former Spice Girl leads in the hairstyle stakes, so former Girls Aloud singer Cheryl follows. Whether it is a bob, a side-plait or a bun, it seems that Cheryl likes to borrow, or revisit, looks from her style mentor.

Of course Victoria, now 40, did it all first — from a career in a world-beating all-girl band to marriage to an England footballer.

The two women were even friends once, particularly during the 2006 World Cup football finals in Germany, when Cheryl travelled to watch her then fiance Ashley Cole and Posh was there, too, with Becks.

However, relations between the two women became frosty after Ashley was accused of cheating in 2008, just two years after their wedding, and Victoria didn’t even call. Cheryl said she’d expected rather more from her fellow WAG.

In an interview in 2009, Cheryl said that Victoria’s clothes were for ‘older women’, and Victoria retaliated by saying that Cheryl’s range of shoes for fashion website Stylist Pick were ‘just a PR stunt’.

Sources in both camps indicate that they have long since made up — certainly Cheryl wore a Victoria Beckham dress in May 2012 to the premiere of the film What To Expect When You’re Expecting, and it was reported that the former Spice Girl had invited Cheryl over for dinner later that year so they could properly let bygones be bygones.

So what does Cheryl’s new hair mean? It seems to be a part of a complete make-under, embarked upon following her whirlwind second marriage to French restaurateur Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini in July last year, which has taken her from tanned, blonde WAG to sophisticated fashionista — a path trodden by Posh herself.

Cheryl has hired a new make-up artist and new stylist in order to embrace a more subtle, more high-fashion look.

Her new image was played to great effect during her much-heralded return as a judge on The X Factor last year, and sources close to the show indicate she will be asked to come back again this year — with a £1.5 million fee dangled as an incentive.

But will she do so, though, with a baby on board? Some fans firmly believe Cheryl is now pregnant, hence the less high-maintenance hair cut, and her relative lack of postings on Twitter and Instagram in recent weeks.

If that’s true, she can look forward to a whole new range of copycat cuts — after all, there are four Victoria Beckham pregnancies to turn to . . .
