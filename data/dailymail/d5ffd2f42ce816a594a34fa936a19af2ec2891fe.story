The killer of toddler James Bulger was treated to a five-course Christmas dinner in jail, more than other inmates, it was claimed today.

Jon Venables, 29, who is back in prison after he was caught with child pornography, got the 'special treatment' because warders feared he would self harm, it has been claimed.

Venables, who was just 10 when he killed two-year-old James, was said to have been given two more courses than other inmates at the jail.

As well as the extra food, staff also apparently gave the killer paedophile three new board games and a phone card with extra credit, the Daily Star reported.

Jamie's mother, Denise Fergus, 42, from Liverpool, told the Star: 'The problem with Venables is he thinks he's some kind of special case.'

She added: 'He should not get any special treatment in prison because by doing that they are giving him the impression he is the victim, which is all wrong.'

The MailOnline cannot reveal which jail Venables is being kept in for legal reasons.

He was reportedly given a new identity in May this year after pictures purporting to show him were published on a website devoted to naming and shaming child abusers.

Last month the Daily Mail reported that Venables is being kept in custody indefinitely for his own safety, because he cannot be trusted to keep his identity a secret.

It was also claimed today that Venables will even get double pay in his prison job of cleaning the five-room secure unit in which he is held.

An insider at the prison told the Star: 'He's got a very arrogant attitude, they are pandering to him and he knows he has this power.'

A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice told the paper it does not comment on individual prisoners' cases.
