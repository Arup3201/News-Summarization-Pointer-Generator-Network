Arsene Wenger has revealed that he is 'scared' Aaron Ramsey will miss Arsenal's busy Christmas schedule through injury.

Ramsey suffered a slight hamstring strain during the 4-1 Champions League win against Galatasaray.

Despite the Welsh midfielder claiming he was taken off as a 'precaution' during the clash, Wenger now expects the 23-year-old to be back in late December at the earliest.

Speaking at his press conference on Friday, Wenger said: 'I am scared he (Ramsey) will miss the Christmas period.

'He should be back at the end of December, [or] beginning of January.'

Wenger also revealed winger Theo Walcott will be assessed on Saturday ahead of Arsenal's Premier League clash against Liverpool on Sunday. 

Walcott has been back in training after the groin problem he suffered while on international duty with England.

Wenger added: 'Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Walcott will be assessed tomorrow (Saturday). Laurent Koscielny is still out.'
