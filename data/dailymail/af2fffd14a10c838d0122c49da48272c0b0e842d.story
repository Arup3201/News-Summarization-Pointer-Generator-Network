He is prone to misfiring and, according to football fans, has rarely been out of first gear in recent months.

But that has not stopped Premier League striker Steven Fletcher looking very pleased with himself as he took delivery of a £260,000 supercar.

For long-suffering Sunderland supporters the photograph of the £40,000-a-week Scottish international and his 217mph Lamborghini Aventador was a blatant own goal – and they were not slow to put the boot in.

Aventador: Steven Fletcher, who has scored just seven times in two years for Sunderland, suffered a Twitter backlash after the photograph of him with the supercar on the driveway of his home went viral

They said the car was undeserved given Fletcher’s poor performances, especially as the picture was taken days before Sunderland suffered a 4-0 thrashing.

The club is 17th in the Premier League after winning just four of 30 league games this season, scoring only 23 goals in the process – the league’s second lowest.

And Fletcher – who cost £12million – has rarely troubled the scoreboard.

Dozens of fans shared a mock message on Twitter reading: ‘Steven Fletcher: two seasons, seven goals, one new Lamborghini Aventador.’ 

Janet Rowan, from the Sunderland Supporters’ Association, said: ‘We know footballers have these big flash cars. I just think the timing was really appalling and I can really understand the way that people have felt about this. 

Showing his moves: Fletcher (centre) was among Sunderland players who took to the catwalk for the Foundation of Light's annual charity fashion show at the Stadium of Light in November 2013

Comparisons: Birmingham fan Michael Jabbari quoted a message from parody account BBC Sporf in a tweet, which said: 'Steven Fletcher: two seasons, seven goals, one new Lamborghini Aventador'

Unimpressed: In response to the photo, Sunderland fan JamesTheMackem posted on Twitter that it was 'the most undeserved Lambo for a football player, ever'

‘To see someone taking possession of a car of that value, when most of the fans who go to the game are on a pittance, it was probably the straw that broke the camel’s back.’ 

 The footballer’s agent said it was the firm that sold the car that had posted the picture online.

Scott Fisher said: ‘It wasn’t Steven that put the picture up. The company who were doing advertising on it done it. I don’t know what the problem is and what people are getting excited about.’

The background of the picture shows another luxury car – a Bentley – in the drive of the 27-year-old’s £670,000 home in Durham.

Another online critic, Jamesthemackem, wrote: Steven Fletcher has a Lamborghini, the most undeserved Lambo for a football player, ever.’

Jack Liddell posted on Twitter: ‘Tell me how Steven Fletcher (a striker) can score seven goals in two seasons yet have earned a Lamborghini Aventador and a Bentley Continental.’

Fletcher has commanded more than £20million in transfer fees and is known to have a liking for luxury vehicles. 

He moved to the five-bedroom home in County Durham with his beauty-queen partner Rachel Monaghan, 24, in October 2013.

Around then he reportedly bought a £50,000 Mercedes 4x4 for the former Miss Scotland finalist. They have a daughter called Darcy-Mae, aged one.

Fletcher has struggled for form at Sunderland. He only managed three goals last season and four so far this campaign.
