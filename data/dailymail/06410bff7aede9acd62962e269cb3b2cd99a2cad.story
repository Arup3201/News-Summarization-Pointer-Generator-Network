In the Orthodox Jewish community, where only men are allowed to file for divorce - one American rabbi became an advocate for the women by threatening and beating their husbands into submission.

Without a divorce paper called a 'get' women who have separated from their husbands are unable to marry again, and have little resources to provide for themselves and their families, which can lead to desperate situations.

Rabbi Mendel Epstein offered these women an alternative. Charging thousands of dollars, he would allegedly torture his fellow Orthodox men into signing the gets and freeing their wives.  

But the 69-year-old's operation came crashing down in a sting carried out by the FBI last year. Now, Epstein is largely confined to his home in Lakewood, New Jersey as he waits a trial scheduled for early next year. If convicted on multiple counts of kidnapping, he could be sent behind bars for 25 years to life.

A recent article in GQ magazine traces his work in the community where he is considered both a bully and a savior.

For years, Epstein's business obtaining 'gets' was not a big secret among the Orthodox Jews of New York and New Jersey, who consider it  blasphemous to report such crimes to secular law enforcement.

But Epstein had been on the FBI's radar since the early 1990s when a group of Orthodox men came forward to detail traumatic experiences in which they were beat up or threatened by men who forced them to agree to a divorce.  

Victim: Meir Bryskman (pictured) was beat up in OCtober 2010 by a man named David Wax who says he was working for Epstein to obtain a 'get' for Bryskman's wife in israel

All of the men pointed to Epstein as the man responsible, but there wasn't enough evidence to pin him then. 

'For a long time, it was always his name that came up. He was beating guys up, he was giving them bloody noses, he was using cattle prods. He had a gang of thugs, and he had a van, and he'd scoop you right off the street,' says New York therapist Monty Weinstein told GQ. 

Epstein's organization started to unfurl though in October 2010, when an Israeli-national named Meir Bryskman was beat up and forced to grant a 'get' when he traveled to America after separating from his wife.

Bryskman was going to the home of David Wax in Lakewood one night that month, when he knocked on the door and was greeted with a punch in the nose. 

He was then blindfolded and beaten for some time as his captives warned the night would only end in 'a divorce or a funeral'. 

He says the men showed him a body bag so he could 'get used to the size', burned him with acid and threatened to take him to the Poconos where he would be eaten alive by rats. 

Fearing for his life, Bryskman agreed to the divorce and to wire his wife $100,000.

Surprisingly, Bryskman broke Orthodox code and reported the incident to police,recalling the horrors of the terrifying night. 

Wax pleaded guilty to kidnapping last May, but told the court he was only carrying out the crime on behalf of Epstein. 

When police searched Wax's house, they found an invoice from Step on Me Carpet & Flooring for a $1,311.10 'emergency carpet installation'.

Prosecutors said Wax was part of Epstein's syndicate which 'engaged in the business of kidnapping and torturing people, beating them up, tying them up, shocking them with Tasers and stun guns until they got what they wanted'. 

That incident sparked the FBI to intervene, sending undercover agents pretending to be an Orthodox brother and sister to Epstein's offices to request his services in August 2013. 

The two made up a story about the sister's husband who was hiding out in South America, refusing to grant a divorce, and Epstein jumped at the opportunity to help them out - for about $50,000. 

The agents recorded the conversations they had with Epstein, in which he spoke in detail about his fees and how he went about coercing his victims.

Epstein even talked about how they used electric cattle prods to torture men, since the tools leave behind no marks on the body as evidence of an attack.

'If it can get a bull that weighs five tons to move...; You put it in certain parts of his body and in one minute the guy will know,' Epstein said. 

Ouch: Epstein and his cronies allegedly used a cattle prod to torture their victims into agreeing to a divorce 

Two months later, Epstein set up a trap for the alleged husband who was 'lured' back to the U.S. and set to be surprised by the rabbi and his cronies in a warehouse.

Instead, the warehouse was surrounded by FBI agents who stormed in and arrested all eight men.  

Six of the eight men have pleaded guilty to charges of traveling in interstate commerce to commit extortion, while Epstein and another man await trail early next year on multiple counts of kidnapping. 

Epstein's lawyer Robert G Stahl hopes to win the case on the grounds that the government wrongly interfered in the religious matter.

'When all the facts and evidence come out, it will be apparent that the government is on the wrong side of a terrible social injustice,' Stahl said. 

'By inserting itself into a complicated religious issue, the government has interfered with the complex religious tenets of an Orthodox Jewish marriage and divorce process. Rabbi Epstein has helped scores of abused women for some thirty years equal the playing field in a male-dominated religious world.'
