Everyone who uses a smartphone, laptop or tablet computer could face censorship by Brussels under the EU’s new right to be forgotten rule, a House of Lords report warned yesterday.

The law – which allows anyone to request for material about them to be taken off the internet – could apply not just to internet giants such as Google but to every individual who uses the internet or social media.

It could leave individuals open to legal challenges from people who want them to remove material from their Facebook page, Twitter account, or even from their own email or text records, according to the House of Lords European Union Committee. 

Facebook: Users of the social network could face censorship under the EU's 'right to be forgotten rule'

It said the right to be forgotten rule was wrong in principle and unworkable in practice.

EU judges ruled that people should have the right to demand that links to material about them are removed from search engines if the information is ‘inadequate, irrelevant or excessive’.

Peers said the rule ‘logically’ extended to users and urged ministers to ‘ensure that the definition of data controller in the new regulation is amended to clarify that the term does not include ordinary users of search engines’.
