Dramatic new forensic evidence could clear a university student convicted of the brutal murder of her married lover's young wife.

Mindy Sanghera, a Sikh now aged 30, was jailed for life in 2007 after a jury found her guilty of murdering the 17-year-old pregnant wife of playboy businessman Sair Ali, a Muslim.

But the case against her was largely based on circumstantial evidence – there was no forensic proof that she stabbed Mr Ali's wife Sana more than 40 times and plunged a knife into her womb at his family's £500,000 home in Bury, Greater Manchester.

Sanghera's legal team have now unearthed what they consider to be 'compelling new evidence' for the case to be referred to the Court of Appeal and her conviction quashed.

They say fresh analysis of mobile phones suggests someone used or accessed the victim's phone after Sanghera had left the home, while new tests show Sanghera could not have escaped through a small kitchen window without leaving forensic traces.

The Criminal Cases Review Commission, which refers cases to the Court of Appeal, is 'actively pursuing' new lines of inquiry.

The twist in the case comes as pictures emerged of Sanghera inside Foston Hall women's prison in Derbyshire, where she is serving a minimum 14-year life term.

The photographs, showing her in full make-up and in a variety of poses in the prison garden and carpeted landing, are likely to raise questions over whether convicted killers should be afforded such privileges.

She also has her own cell, complete with TV, radio, kettle and washing facilities.

In a submission to the commission, her lawyer, Julian Young, said the phone analysis 'puts an almost totally different complexion on the case'. He added: 'It is submitted that the evidence points strongly to the fact that whoever accessed the mobile telephone was the murderer.'

A key part of the appeal concerns Sanghera's footprint, which was found near a window in the kitchen.

The prosecution said that the student climbed through this after butchering her love rival.

But Sanghera insists Sana let her out through the door and then locked it. She says she had gone to see the young bride to tell her that her husband was a love cheat.

In legal papers, Mr Young says his client accepts she stood near a window to try to close it. But he adds that a videoed reconstruction shows it would have been difficult for her to get through it easily and without leaving forensic evidence.

At the time of the murder, in May 2007, Sanghera was two years into an affair with Mr Ali and had learned he had gone through with an arranged marriage to his teenage cousin Sana.

Days after contacting police to say she had been at their home hours before Sana's body was found, Sanghera was charged with murder.

Her lawyers say detectives were too quick to rule out other possible suspects and motives.

Born to a hard-working Sikh couple, Sanghera was a straight A student on the brink of graduating from Birmingham University's dentistry school. Mr Ali, who ran his own mobile phone business, had led a playboy lifestyle, conducting affairs and frequenting nightclubs. He admitted at the trial that he had 'sinned'.

He met Harmohinder Kaur Sanghera, known as Mindy, in 2005, and they conducted their affair in hotel rooms. When Sanghera found out Sana was pregnant, she became consumed with jealousy, her trial heard.

Sanghera admitted visiting Sana when Mr Ali was out at Friday prayers, but said she had left her alive and well, and at her trial the defence suggested Mr Ali had killed her. In 2009, the Court of Appeal threw out her case.

At home in Shirley in the West Midlands, Sanghera's parents Paul, 52, a postman, and Suki, 51, who works at Marks & Spencer, said their daughter is determined to clear her name.

Mrs Sanghera said: 'From day one, Mindy has told the truth.'

Mr Ali now lives overseas and could not be reached for comment. His father refused to comment.
