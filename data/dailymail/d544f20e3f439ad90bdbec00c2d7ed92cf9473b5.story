A 26-year-old man from Detroit has scored a burgeoning fan base after slipping into a princess gown for his young niece.

Jesse Nagy posted a photograph of himself wearing the strapless dress to Facebook on Sunday along with the caption: 'Sometimes you just have to be a princess. Going to see Cinderella! Uncle of the year.'

In the picture his chest hair, tattoos, muscular arms and facial scruff cut a comical contrast to the girly get-up he's wearing.

The full-time actor topped off the ensemble with a diamante handbag and tiara - although he stuck to comfortable flip flops instead of glass slippers.

Spot the difference: Jesse Nagy, 26, from Detroit has scored a burgeoning fan base after slipping into a princess gown for his young niece Izzy 

Nagy said that his four-year-old niece Izzy was nervous to wear her princess gown in public so he decided to put her at ease by wearing a matching outfit.

He apparently borrowed a prom dress from a similar-sized friend for the evening. 

The duo then ventured out together to a movie theater in Florence, Alabama, garnering a range of confused looks from passers-by. 

An employee at the cinema even shared a photo of Nagy and Izzy on Reddit where it received more than one million views.

'The niece was embarrassed to wear her princess costume to the movies. The uncle didn't like that,' they explained.

Thousands of commenters have applauded Nagy for his actions.

One fan wrote: 'From a mom that has a son your age . . . it warms my heart what you did.'

Another joked:  'Welcome to being the most wanted man in America.' 

Nagy told ABC News he will continue taking Izzy out on their special dates even if it involves dressing up.

'If it’s going to make her happy, I'll do it, I don’t care.' 

He added that the princess dressing stunt  got him more publicity in three hours than his five years of professional acting put together.
