Mike Valenzo, 72, was found dead Saturday in Staten Island, New York

A wealthy supermarket owner died after apparently slipping on ice just outside his Staten Island mansion on one of the coldest nights of the year.

Mike Valenzo, 72, was found by a business partner Saturday morning on the front steps of his home - hours after leaving a birthday party on foot.

It was around 2F outside at the time. 

Valenzo, who owns three Met Foods outlets across New York City, had been celebrating at the Richmond County Country Club - less than a mile from his home.

Guests said he left around 10.30pm to make the short walk home - but apparently never made it.

According to the Staten Island Advance, Valenzo was found face-up outside his home. Fani said he likely had his keys in his hand when he slipped, and they flew backwards as he fell.

The wealthy businessman, known locally as a kind-hearted philanthropist, was reportedly in good health when he decided to make the journey home.

Business associate Bill Fani said he found Valenzo dead outside when he came by his house around 7am to take him to the airport. He was supposed to head to Florida to meet his wife.

Police have said there is nothing suspicious about the death.

According to the New York Post, Valenzo was among 230 guests at the country club on Friday night and was mingling with bankers, politicians and high-profile businessmen at the 60th birthday celebration.

The New York City Medical Examiner has reportedly opened an investigation into the death, to work out whether he was killed by his fall or whether other medical conditions played a part.
