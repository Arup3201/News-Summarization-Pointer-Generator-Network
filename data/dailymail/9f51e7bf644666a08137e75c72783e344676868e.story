Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta admitted that Arsenal 'threw everything away' after their 3-3 draw with Anderlecht on Tuesday night, and the midfielder injured his hamstring in the process.

The Gunners were 3-0 up on the night, but after a last-minute Aleksandar Mitrovic header, could only manage a 3-3 draw. 

The result means that Borussia Dortmund extend their lead at the top of Group D to five points, a total that Arsene Wenger's side will struggle to make up. 

Arteta was substituted with the score at 3-1, but Arsenal went on to draw 3-3 after a late equaliser

The Arsenal captain came off injured with the score at 3-1, and Arsene Wenger admitted post-match that he will miss Sunday's game against Swansea. 

'[It's a] hamstring - I don't know how long he will be out,' the Arsenal manager stated. 

Arteta was honest in his summary of the game: 'I don't know [how it got away from us],' he told Sky Sports after the final whistle. 'We can't afford to make those mistakes, it's just not good enough.

'We had a 3-0 lead at home and we know what we're playing for. We'll analyse the mistakes and see what happened in the second half. It's not up to the level of this club.

'The main aim when you start the competition is to win the group but we have thrown everything away tonight. You can't do that in this competition.'

Arsenal host Borussia Dortmund in their next Champions League match on November 26.
