The family of a Colorado woman who was killed last week when a gunman attempted to set off explosives after allegedly shooting his wife now say she may have died trying to protect a neighbor from her violent husband.

Police shot Denver resident Daniel 
Abeyta, 31, suspected of killing his next-door neighbor Sandra Roskilly, 47, and wounding his own wife last Friday after he fired a gunshot at one of
several propane tanks that he placed in the middle of a street.

On Monday, Roskilly's brother, Dennis Campbell, spoke out for the first time about his sister's murder, saying that his sibling knew that her neighbors had a tumultuous 
relationship and were no strangers to domestic violence.

According to Campbell, his sister would often console Abeyta's 26-year-old wife after fights, leading him to believe that when Roskilly heard gunshots and screams Friday, she rushed to her friend's aid. 

'In her last moments, she was doing what she wanted to do,' he told the station 9News. '[She was] 
trying to reach out to a neighbor that was in trouble.'

Police said Abeyta was being held for investigation of charges including murder. The wounded woman was reported to be Abeyta's estranged spouse, according to KDVR.

Campbell
said on the day of the killing, he was on his way to his sister's 
house for a visit, but became struck in a traffic jam. He never got to see Roskilly 
alive again.

‘In my mind, I just wish I had been there a little sooner. But, again, you never know,’ Campbell said.

The incident started at 10.40am Friday in the Harvey Park neighborhood in the 2200 block of South Irving, when police said Abeyta shot dead Roskilly after wounding his wife.

Officers who responded to the scene spotted a man, who then fired a shot at propane tanks set up in the middle of the street with gunpowder on top. The maeksehift device 'activated,' but no ibe was one injured.

One of the officers then shot Abeyta in the chest. Police said the man was in critical condition, while his wife was in serious condition with a gunshot wound to the leg.

Before he was shot, Abeyta was seen walking with his weapons. Police alerted residents to stay inside and a high school was put on lockdown. Abeyta was shot within about a half hour of that warning.

Police didn't immediately say whether Abeyta lived in the neighborhood, but Melissa Allen told The Denver Post that he has lived in the area at least since she moved in three years ago.

She said he lived in a house with his wife and two children, who are in elementary school.

Allen said she and her children saw him walk down the street Friday.

Abeyta, an Army veteran allegedly suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, has had multiple run-ins with the law over the years. In 2007, he was arrested on charges of felony menacing with a deadly weapon and felony child abuse.

Court documents cited by ABC2News state that Abeyta's wife took out a restraining order against him and the couple filed for divorce, but it was never finalized.

According to Roskilly's long-time friend, Daniel Markin, she and Abeyta had been in conflict in the past.

Markin explained to The Denver Channel that the 31-year-old man was upset that his neighbor's rose bushes were encroaching on his property.

‘Daniel was pretty much trying to get Sandy out of her house anyway he could,’ Markin said.

Loved ones described Roskilly as a loving and generous woman who would do anything for others. Earlier this month, the 47-year-old celebrated a major milestone in her life, according to 9News.

After struggling with obesity for years, Roskilly managed to shed 220lbs in just one year. On Facebook, Roskilly joyfully boasted about her weight loss.

On August 5, she wrote: 'I'm getting so close to my goal of 160 Lb. that it scars [sic]me so time not jokin im now 199lb.'
