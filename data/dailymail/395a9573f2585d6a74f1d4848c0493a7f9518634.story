Daisy Lowe has walked the 
runway for Marc Jacobs, showcased lingerie for Agent Provocateur and counts Alexa Chung and Harry Styles as close friends.

And now, one of fashion's coolest faces is giving her fans a glimpse into her world by welcoming Vestiaire Collective fans into her swanky Primrose Hill home.

Speaking about her enviable wardrobe, the star told the fashion site: 'I’m crazily organised with my wardrobe. 
Everything is hung in categories: dresses, jackets, shirts, skirts and 
trousers are all hung in order, and they’re then hung in colour order 
too so that when I’m looking for something I know exactly where it is.'

Welcome to my world: Daisy Lowe, 25, has invited fashion fans into her Primrose Hill home and treats us to a sneak peek into her designer wardrobe

Daisy, who cites Wednesday Addams, Bettie Page and Kate Hudson as her style icons, describes her seasonal must-haves as a Christopher Kane suit and a few Richard Nicoll pieces. 'There were a lot of great pastel coats this season as well,' she adds.

Speaking about a piece she always wanted but never managed to get her hands on, Daisy pays tribute to late designer L’Wren Scott. 'I have a version of her dress in pink but I’d love it in black. It has a little white collar and just holds you in all the right places.

'The way she cut her clothes just makes you feel so womanly. Nicole Kidman has worn it too.'

The 25-year-old cites the three things she 'absolutely' couldn't live without as a vintage Chanel necklace that she wears almost every day, a pair of black combat boots and a Saint Laurent leather jacket, which 'I don’t have yet but I’m definitely going to get!'.

Daisy, who garners inspiration from old photos of Katherine Hepburn and Brigitte Bardot, credits Rodial Glamoxy Snake Serum, Crème de la Mer eye cream and 'a plethora of masks once a week' for giving her that rosy glow.   

Homemaker: Daisy, who is currently preparing to release her own cookbook, says she is extremely organised and has separate sections in her wardrobe for each item

Aside from taking the fashion world by storm and hanging out with the new Primose Hill set, Daisy has been working on a cookbook.

The model is preparing to reveal how she eats her way to such an enviable physique in Sweetness & Light is - a collection of recipes for 60 healthy sweet treats.

By making simple changes to ingredients, such as using maple syrup 
rather than refined sugar, or discovering new ingredients like raw 
chocolate, Daisy promises that her recipes are transformed into something 'devilishly 
delicious' but 'angelically healthy'.

Domestic goddess: Model Daisy Lowe has penned a cookbook in which she shares her favourite healthy sweet treats

Speaking about the £15 
book, which will hit shelves in July, Daisy said: 'This is the result of
 my journey to discover the craft of baking guilt-free delicious treats.

'I wanted to create a collection of recipes that ensure you can enjoy sweet things without harming your body.

'I love food and I have the sweetest tooth but I have to look after my body doing what I do for a living, I started collecting lots of wheat-free, dairy-free and refined sugar free recipes to make for whenever I wanted to treat myself. I wanted to share them with the world because I wanted other people to enjoy sweet treats guilt-free.

Daisy explains that limiting sugar has had a huge impact on her life. 'My sugar intake affects everything, my energy levels, my skin, my mood...I love, love, love sugar but I have to limit my intake and find alternatives to satisfy my sweet tooth,' she said.
