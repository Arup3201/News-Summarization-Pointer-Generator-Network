 

A dog waited for her owner for five months after their Kansas City house exploded, killing a man and critically injuring another in the process.

The dog, now named Asha, was left homeless and suffered injuries from the blaze. Her greatest pain was the loss of her owner Wiley Mitchell Jr. for whom she waited five months to return.

Investigators say that on June 4, people inside a home on Tennessee Avenue were making illegal fireworks and that's what caused the deadly combustion.

Loyal: Asha waited by her dead owner's house for five months after he died and their home was destroyed

Dead:  52-year-old Wiley Mitchell Jr. died days after the explosion after losing both his legs and one of his arms and Asha lingered by the destroyed property waiting for him to come home

KTLA reports that 52-year-old Wiley Mitchell Jr. died days after the explosion after losing both his legs and one of his arms.

Another man was critically injured.

Asha was one of the family's three dogs but she was the only one out of the three to survive the blast.

She had a willingness to live so that she could be reunited with her owner and she refused to leave the property even when neighbors and animal workers tried to save her numerous times.

'Once the house had exploded, the family never came back because of the tragedy,' The Rescue Project outreach lead Lori lamb said.

'She obviously had the will to live. She had hope to live,' Lamb said.

'That’s the reason why we named her Asha because it stands for hope.'

After numerous attempts at rescuing the dog, neighbors called The Rescue project to set up a humane trap to save the mourning pooch.

Initial attempts were unsuccessful but thankfully their efforts were not in vain.

'The neighbor called and said she was in the trap,' Lamb said. 'We were ecstatic.'

Asha is currently being cared for at the Great Plains SPCA where they are running tests to determine the severity of her injuries which were left untreated for months.

After she is nursed back to health, veterinarians will find her a new and loving home.

'We have a lot of people just ready to see that happy ending for Asha,' Great Plains SPCA chief communications officer Rachel Hodgson told KTLA. 

New home: Once Asha's injuries have healed she will be placed in a new and loving home
