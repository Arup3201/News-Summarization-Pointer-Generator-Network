The Conservatives are expected to win the crucial by-election in Newark next week, putting the brakes on the momentum of Ukip, a poll claimed last night.

But it predicted the Tory majority in the safe seat will be slashed from 16,000 to around 2,300 after a massive swing to Nigel Farage’s party.

The Survation opinion poll last night gave the Conservatives an eight point lead on 36 per cent ahead of Ukip on 28 per cent.

David Cameron has already visited the constituency three times and has a fourth visit planned next week

Labour was one point behind with 27 per cent and the Lib Dems in fourth on just five per cent in the poll for the Sun newspaper.

Winning in the by-election next Thursday has been described as ‘imperative’ by the Conservatives who are desperate to show that Ukip’s success in last week’s European elections was just a protest vote.

David Cameron has already visited the constituency three times and has a fourth visit planned next week.

He has ordered all Conservative MPs to make at least three visits each to the constituency, which he has made a priority.

After last week's electoral success, Ukip leader Nigel Farage said he planned to do 'everything he could' to seize the seat

Yesterday alone, five ministers were campaigning in Newark, including Chancellor George Osborne, Home Secretary Theresa May and Culture Secretary Sajid David.

Tomorrow a further six ministers are expected to make the trip to the seat vacated by shamed Tory MP Patrick Mercer.

After last week’s electoral success, Ukip leader Mr Farage said he planned to do ‘everything he could’ to seize the seat.

Ukip’s candidate Roger Helmer yesterday said he believed the Conservatives were ‘scared s***less’.

He said: ‘We got a great European Election result and that has had a dramatic effect. It has legitimised Ukip as a voters’ choice – if everybody is voting for Ukip it must be all right – and it has shown we can win. 

'Cameron is terrified of losing the seat. The Prime Minister coming here three times? I mean, Nigel Farage is coming once.

'Maybe we won’t win, but we will certainly cut that majority right down.’

Tory David Willetts last night dismissed the surge of Ukip and said he was confident the public would vote for the ‘grown-ups’ at the General Election next year.

The Universities and Science Minister said voters had had the ‘opportunity to get a message to the government without any real consequences’ but added: ‘Next year people will be picking a government.’
