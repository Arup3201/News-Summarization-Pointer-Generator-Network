The Australia team will be battling their emotions and ‘inner demons’ when they play the first Test since the death of Phillip Hughes.

The Aussies take on India in a rescheduled first Test at Hughes’s adopted home ground, the Adelaide Oval, in what is sure to be an emotional atmosphere.

Players will wear Hughes’s Baggy Green No 408 on their shirts, as well as black armbands. They will line up on the outfield before the first day’s play, in front of a giant 408 painted on the grass, to watch a video tribute to their former team-mate, which will be followed by 63 seconds of applause — the score on which Hughes was unbeaten when he was fatally injured by a bouncer during a domestic Sheffield Shield match just under two weeks ago.

Shane Watson said preparing for it has been 'the most challenging couple of days' of his career

All-rounder Shane Watson is one of four members of the Test squad who were on the outfield at the Sydney Cricket Ground at the time Hughes was struck while playing for South Australia. He is confident all squad members will be physically and emotionally ready to play but he spoke honestly and openly about the impact Hughes’s death has had on him since returning to training two days after the 25-year-old’s funeral.

He said: ‘Mentally, it’s been the most challenging couple of days I’ve had to go through in my career, after seeing what happened over the past week, trying to process everything that happened, especially being there at the SCG.

‘The first couple of sessions were tough, especially the first one. A few things flooded into my head as soon as I went out to bat… I thought I’d processed quite well over the previous week.

Watson said it would be difficult facing aggressive bowling after what happened to Phillip Hughes

‘This has been as important a four days’ lead up to a Test match that I have ever been involved in because there are a lot of inner demons that we’ve had to find our way through.’

For Watson, one of those demons involves facing up to top quality, aggressive, fast bowling — something he has done without a second thought for 52 Tests and 178 ODIs since his international debut in 2002. Suddenly, having witnessed close up what happened to Hughes, he has been struggling to put thoughts of the risks to one side when it comes to his own batting.

‘It’s been a big challenge to try to put the memories that are very much in the front of my mind — very recent — to move them back a bit in my mind and trust what I do as a batsman. I know everyone’s going to be in the same boat.

‘Bowling is a hell of a lot easier than batting because you have to make sure you hold your nerve while guys are steaming in.’

Watson admitted to feeling apprehensive about facing bouncers in the nets over the past couple of days, but said it got easier the more he batted — hence why he stayed in the nets half an hour longer than anyone else on Sunday.

‘There was initially (some apprehension), no doubt. But I’ve got more comfortable with just reacting to what I see and trusting my skill.

He added: ‘You know that if at any stage you get a ball and you get unlucky and it hits you in the wrong spot it can cause some serious damage.

‘I knew I had to confront it from day one when I went in, and every day that I’ve gone in I’ve felt more comfortable.’

Captain Michael Clarke looks set to lead Australia after coming through a fitness test over the weekend. He batted with purpose in the nets on Sunday, having been struggling with a recurrence of his hamstring injury.

His inclusion will give added poignancy to the opening day of the Test match after being such a figure of support for the Hughes family and delivering the most heartfelt and tearful of tributes.

Given the emotional burden Clarke has shouldered, he has been excused from the captain’s traditional eve-of-Test press conference. That job has gone to Mitchell Johnson, Australia’s chief aggressor with the ball, who roughed up the England batsmen during the last Ashes series.

There has been an international debate over the use of the bouncer in the wake of Hughes’s death but Watson is in no doubt that the Aussies will go hard at India.

‘We’ve played our best cricket when we are aggressive. Aggressive with bat and ball but especially with the ball, as we were during the last Ashes series. That’s not going to change because that’s when we are at our absolute best.’

Adelaide  will host the first of four Tests between Australia and India before Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney

Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said he hoped the Test will be an opportunity for supporters to pay tribute to Hughes.

‘Soon after arriving in Adelaide Phillip became a crowd favourite,’ he said. ‘This is an opportunity for those who embraced him so fondly to say their goodbye.’

When the 63 seconds of applause bursts out at the Adelaide Oval it will be hard to avoid the thought that his score that day at the SCG would surely have seen him recalled to the Test squad for the start of this series.

Perhaps, instead, this Test will signify the start of a healing process for those players who were closest to Hughes. As silent mourning is replaced by ringing applause, a group of men will begin the hardest game of cricket they are likely to play in their lives.
