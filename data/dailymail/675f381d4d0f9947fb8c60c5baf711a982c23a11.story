Demonstrators behind Occupy Wall Street can now add another feather in their cap in the fight against economic inequality.

A new study shows CEO salaries are back on the rise - with one top executive earning a shocking $145.2million in 2010.

John Hammergren, who took home the hefty paycheck as CEO of healthcare provider McKesson, joined nine other executives from firms including Aetna, Omnicare and CVS on a GMI Report that concluded their salaries amounted to a staggering $770million last year.

Meanwhile, wages for most Americans have failed to keep up with inflation.

Top earner: John Hammergren, president and chief executive officer of McKesson Corp, stands to make $469million if the company changes ownership

According to a Guardian report on the 
U.S. CEO pay survey, 
executives behind America's biggest companies are banking huge pay 
increases after two years pf maintaining relatively steady incomes.

The earnings of chief executives jumped between 27 and 40 per cent in 2010, according a GMI Ratings report.

The corporate governance organization 
said while executive salaries had remained relatively steady in 2008 and
2009 due to the economic crisis, a rise in the stock market supported 
the pay rises.

The median value of CEO profits on stock options 
rose 70 per cent in 2010 from $950,400 to $1.3million.

Departed: Omnicare's Joel Gemunder pocketed cash severance of $16million, a small portion of his $98.28million final pay package

The lavish rewards come at a time of high unemployment and cuts to public spending.

The survey, the largest conducted of CEO pay in the U.S., included 2,647 companies.

The resulting data shows sharp 
increases from 2009, when base salaries showed a median increase of 
approximately two per cent and annual cash compensation increased just 
over 1.5 per cent.

In 2010, the top ten bread winners earned more than a combined $770million.

The Russell 3000 measure of U.S. stock
prices rose 16.93 per cent in last year. CEO pay was up by 27.19 per 
cent overall, according to the Guardian report.

Lining pockets: Ronald Williams, former head of health insurer Aetna, earned $50.4million in 2010 after exercising $2.4million in stock options

High rollers: Former General Growth Properties CEO Adam Metz (left) departed with a $46million cash bonus while CVS' Thomas Ryan made $28million on options

S&P 500 CEOs, meanwhile, saw a 
36.47 per cent increase in compensation - including perks and pensions 
and stock awards. Total compensation pay at midcap companies rose 40.2 
percent.

McKesson's Hammergren was one of 
three healthcare executives in the top ten. According to the Guardian, 
he also stands to make $469million if the company changes ownership.

Four of the ten highest paid executives were retired or departing.

John Hammergren, McKesson$145.2million

Joel Gemunder, Omnicare$98.28million

Ronald Williams, Aetna$50.4million

Adam Metz, General Growth Properties$46million

Thomas Ryan CVS$28million

GGP executivesCombined nearly $115million

Ronald Williams, who assumed his role 
in 2006 as head of health insurer Aetna, earned $50.4million in 2010 
after exercising $2.4million in stock options before making his departure.

CVS executive Thomas Ryan made $28million on his options.

Omnicare's Joel Gemunder pocketed cash severance of $16million, a small portion of his $98.28million final pay package.

Adam Metz, the former boss of General 
Growth Properties, a real estate company that specialises in shopping 
malls, made the list when he made off with a $46million cash bonus. The 
Guardian also reports GGP executives received nearly $115million in 
bonuses from the firm as it emerged from bankruptcy.

There were no bankers in the top ten list.
