Jose Mourinho had a message for agents scrambling to represent him back in 2004: 'Go and organise a meeting with Roman Abramovich.' 

Four potential representatives all promised they'd be able to set up a meeting with Chelsea's owner after the Portuguese identified Stamford Bridge as his next move. 

But only Jorge Mendes followed through; the rest, as they say, is history. 

Jose Mourinho has revealed the details of his 2004 move from Porto to Chelsea in a new biography

Mourinho told four potential agents that they must fix a meeting with Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich 

In a new biography published in Spain this week - The Special Agent - The key to Mendes, the secret of the biggest football agent in the world - Mourinho revealed the mechanics behind his move to the Blues. 

'There were three agents who wanted to represent me,' the Chelsea boss said. 'Then a fourth agent appeared who was Jorge Mendes. 

'I said to them, "The one who keeps me is the one who brings me Abramovich or takes me to him." Two days later, Mendes rang: "Abramovich is in Portugal and wants to see you".'

While the pair were meeting with the Russian billionaire, another agent rang Mourinho. 

'He told me he was with Abramovich in Paris. And there I was, with Abramovich in front of me. 

'Jorge had prove to me he wasn't lying.'
