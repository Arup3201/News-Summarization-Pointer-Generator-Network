A PE teacher has been barred from teaching after he was found to have bullied and intimidated his pupils.

Paul Green, 39, swore at children and ordered them to do press ups or stand in the rain if he felt they stepped out of line.

He also made one pupil kiss another, threw items across classrooms when he was angry and nicknamed an overweight pupil ‘JCB’.

Paul Green, 39, swore at children and ordered them to do press ups or stand in the rain if he felt they stepped out of line. A teaching panel found that he was guilty of 'unacceptable professional conduct' while at St Thomas More College, Stoke-on-Trent between 2004 and 2012

A teaching panel found that he was guilty of ‘unacceptable professional conduct’ while at St Thomas More College, Stoke-on-Trent between 2004 and 2012.

He has been banned from teaching for three years.

Professor Janet Draper said: ‘There were concerns from an early stage, namely in or about February 2006, with regard to the way in which Mr Green addressed pupils by using inappropriate and potentially offensive language.’

Following an incident in November 2011 relating to inappropriate language and behaviour on the part of Green towards pupils, he was suspended.

A further investigation was undertaken which led to statements being taken from a variety of pupils, who complained of 'inappropriate, offensive and undermining behaviour' both in terms of language and physical confrontation. Green resigned from the School in early 2012.

The panel found that Green used improper and inappropriate language and behaviour towards a number of pupils, including mocking and name-calling.

Green admitted using language towards pupils including: 'ugly', 'big ears', 'p****', and 'poof'.

He addressed one pupil with regard to his weight and made reference to a 'JCB', and restrained the boy against a wall when he went to leave.

On the basis of another pupil's evidence, the panel found that Green would use language such as: 'f***off'', "you're p***ing me off" and 'for f***s sake' while in the classroom.

Professor Draper said: 'Whilst such language was not directed at pupils, it was said in such a way that the whole class could clearly hear what he was saying. Such language is considered to be improper and offensive.'

Green called certain pupils undergoing a bleep test 'pathetic' and 'bone idle', called a pupil a 'lying tart' and, during a rounders match, told a boy he would send him to the Deputy Head's corridor 'with a rounder's bat up his a***.'

The panel found that, on one occasion, Green told Pupil C to kiss Pupil I and, when he refused, applied increased pressure until Pupil C leaned over to kiss Pupil I.

Pupil I refused, 'adding to the humiliation felt by Pupil C and Pupil I's reaction is described as one of shock'.

Professor Draper added: 'Mr Green would, when frustrated or angry, throw items across the class such as scrunched up paper, pens and pencils and, on one occasion, the register. This happened on one or two occasions each week.'

He also 'embarrassed and humiliated' a pupil by putting up a picture of Tina Turner on the white board in the class room and then likening the pupil to her and certain of her characteristics such as her hair, however the panel found that this was not intended to be racially insensitive.

Professor Draper added: 'The Panel heard from three pupils who gave oral evidence, and find, that they were all concerned at the behaviour of Mr Green. Pupil B described Mr Green as 'intimidating'.

Pupil C stated that when Mr Green called him names, it made him feel 'small and unhappy'. Pupil D described Mr Green as 'scary' when in a bad mood which he said would occur two or three times a week.

A further investigation was undertaken which led to statements being taken from a variety of pupils, who complained of 'inappropriate, offensive and undermining behaviour' both in terms of language and physical confrontation

'Mr Green was described as unpredictable and that, when he was in a bad mood, the pupils would not know what he would do next.'

The panel said that an incident took place when Green started to throw tennis balls at another PE Teacher and her class, and one of the tennis balls hit a pupil on the back of the head. Another pupil, Pupil K, then threw the ball back towards Mr Green who then started wrestling Pupil K and swinging him about.

On another occasion, Green put his hands up and asked Pupil C to punch them. Although Pupil C did as instructed, Mr Green then grabbed Pupil C's right wrist and slapped Pupil C on the left cheek.

Green also lifted a pupil above his head, and 'applied inappropriate sanctions to manage pupil behaviour' including making a pupil do press-ups in front of the class as a punishment, making them stand outside even if it was raining, confiscating mobile phones contrary to school policy and taking a pupil's jacket and not returning it for a week.

Recommending a Prohibition Order, Professor Draper concluded: 'As a consequence of the findings of fact, it is the panel's conclusion that, whilst employed at St Thomas More Catholic College, Stoke-on-Trent between 2004 and 2012 Mr Green behaved in an inappropriate and bullying manner towards pupils.'

Giving the final decision on behalf of the Secretary of State, Paul Heathcote said: 'The panel have found a number of allegations proven relating to Mr Green's behaviour towards pupils.

'The behaviour extended over a number of years and continued despite warnings. Mr Green's behaviour was a serious departure from the Teachers' Standards and impacted upon the wellbeing of pupils.

'The Panel have found evidence of a deep-seated attitude that leads to harmful behaviour and insufficient evidence that Mr Green recognises this.

'In all the circumstances a Prohibition Order is both a proportionate and appropriate sanction in this case.'

Taking into account that Green's behaviour may have been exacerbated by poor health and personal issues, as well as testimonials provided and his recent good work, he set a minimum period of three years should pass before Green is allowed to apply for the Order to be set aside.

The decision means that Green is banned from teaching in any school, sixth-form college, relevant youth accommodation or children's home in England. He may apply for the Prohibition Order to be set aside, but not until November 2016, and if he does so will have to persuade a panel that he is fit to return to the classroom.

He has a right of appeal to the High Court.
