Following the viral success of the Goat Simulator earlier this year, a designer from New York has created a similar game especially for dog lovers.

Dog Park lets players simulate being a virtual canine and the goal is to chase and dig holes with other dogs.

It is still in an early development stage and is expected to be fully unveiled at September’s No Quarter event in New York.

The game is the brainchild of New Yorker Kevin Cancienne.

A recent study found three quarters of people in a relationship with someone who regularly plays role-playing games wish their partner would pay them more attention. 

Researchers from Brigham Young University discovered the amount of time it takes to play the games, as well as the development of virtual relationships, were blamed for break-ups. 

Other players were found to have had affairs with people they'd met while playing the games.  

However, couples that played role-playing games together said it had strengthened their relationship.

He told Kill Screen Daily: ‘Dog Park is a pretty big departure for me.

'Not only is it in a genre and format I haven't worked in much, but I’ve let the free-flowing qualities I appreciate about dog play come through.’

He continued that he didn’t want the game to be about competition, and the only goal is to ‘keep on having more fun’.

Cancienne regularly tweets teaser screenshots from test versions of the game, and is expected to reveal more as the No Quarter event approaches.

No Quarter is an annual event that takes place at New York University’s Game Centre.

Dog Park is yet another example of animal simulators that appear to be taking the web by storm.

Goat Simulator (pictured) is a third-person game in which players take control of a goat. They can roam the game's virtual world, run, jump, and headbutt objects and people. They can also lick items which stick to the goat's tongue and can be thrown. It was developed by Swedish-based Coffee Stain Studios

In April, the Goat Simulator launched on Steam and let players explore a virtual world through the eyes of the farmyard creature.

Its popularity surprised many, and was closely followed by a Bear Simulator that achieved Kickstarter funding in less than a week.

As the name suggests, Goat Simulator is a third-person game in which players take control of a goat.

They can roam the game's virtual world, run, jump, and headbutt objects and people, as well as lick items which stick to the goat's tongue and can be thrown.

It was developed by Swedish-based Coffee Stain Studios.

In March, Oregon-based Farajay Studios launched a Kickstarter campaign asking for funding for a Bear Simulator, pictured. It is a first-person game that lets players 'do bear things', including exploring, eating fish and plants and sleeping. The campaign hit its target funding within a week

Recreation therapist William Hawkes-Robinson said benefits of playing simulators include stronger reading skills, mathematics, creative thinking, cooperative play, and other creative skills.

He continued: 'There are very few social table-top recreation activities available that are cooperative rather than competitive in nature. 

'Role-playing gaming is, by design, a cooperative past time, which in and of itself may have significant benefits in the world where everything is becoming competitive at all ages and levels of society.'

However, players can also become too involved in the game, and invest too much time emotionally to a character to the detriment of real relationships.

This can lead someone to feel isolated, or develop existing negative feelings such as low self-esteem.
