Hiring in U.S. firms might be strong, but don't expect a pay raise anytime soon, says a new study.

Only 24 per cent of companies increased employees' wages and salaries in the July-September quarter, a survey by the National Association for Business Economics found.

This is compared to a much higher 43 per cent in the April-June quarter. The drop, the first after three straight increases, could be a sign that wage gains may remain weak in coming months.

It comes as U.S firms continue to hire employees at a healthy pace, which usually pushes wages higher as employers compete for workers. A measure of hiring remained near a three-year high.

Don't get your hopes up: U.S. firms were much less likely to boost pay in the third quarter than in previous quarters, a study has found. It fell to just 24 per cent in July-September

However, the figures suggest that the number of people out of work remains high enough that companies are not under any pressure to raise pay.

Despite healthy job gains this year, there were still 9.3 million people unemployed in September, according to government data. That's up from 7.6 million before the Great Recession. 

More than seven million Americans are working part-time but are looking for full-time work, which gives employers an even larger pool of potential employees to choose from.

The NABE surveyed 76 of its member economists in late September. The economists work for companies or private trade associations.

The survey revealed that just one-third of workers believe their companies will boost their wages in the October-December quarter, around the same proportion as three months ago. 

Weaker sales and profits may have also made companies reluctant to boost pay. Just 49 percent of respondents said their company's sales rose in the third quarter, the smallest proportion in a year.

Profits also were squeezed, with 14 percent of firms reporting smaller profit margins. That was the largest proportion to do so in a year.

The study also found that the economists were only modestly concerned about slower growth in Europe. Only 7 percent of firms said a slowdown there would have a significant negative effect.

Forty four percent said it would have a minor negative effect, 46 percent said it would have no impact and just 3 percent said it would have a minor positive effect.

Still, the survey was conducted before weak economic data from the region caused sharp drops in U.S. stock markets in the past two weeks.

Meanwhile, more than three-quarters of the economists surveyed said they expected the Federal Reserve to begin raising its benchmark short-term interest rate in the second quarter of 2015.

But 84 percent said a small increase in rates in the short-term wouldn't hurt their businesses.

And two-thirds of the firms said they were having no difficulty filling their open jobs, a good sign for hiring. Government data shows that job openings are at the highest level in nearly 14 years.

Some economists worry that many of the unemployed don't have the skills needed for the jobs that are available. But the NABE survey suggests that companies are mostly able to fill available jobs.

This is also another likely reason why wages increases are becoming less common; if companies were having more difficulty hiring workers, they might offer higher salaries.
