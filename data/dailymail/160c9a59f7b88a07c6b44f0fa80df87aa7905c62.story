Argentina's McDonald's stores have been hit by a major shortage of ketchup - provoking anger from thousands of customers.

The fast food restaurant has apologised for the 'momentary' crisis which has left many of the 200 outlets in the South American country without the condiment.

McDonald's Agentina tweeted on Monday: 'The ketchup shortage at our local branches is momentary and we hope to solve it as soon as possible. We’re bringing in other sauces to replace it while we try to fix the problem.'

Crisis: Argentina's McDonald's stores have been hit with a shortage of ketchup - provoking fury from customers

One customer tweeted: 'I was just told at McDonald’s there’s no ketchup because it’s stuck at customs.'

A collapsing currency value and rampant inflation is being blamed for the shortage of supply.

McDonald's refused to explain what was causing the problem when ask on Twitter, but it is thought the company is having trouble importing ketchup from Chile as suppliers are reluctant to take the peso as payment for goods.

But the country's president Cristina Kirchner is also coming in for fierce criticism from the thousands of angry diners who have had to forego their favourite source.

The annual Inflation is expected to hit 30 per cent this year, under her economic reforms and stewardship.

In the past years since 2010, inflation has been between 20 per cent and 25 
percent.

An angry twitter user wrote: 'Please Cristina [Kirchner] let us have ketchup.'

Message to customer: The McDonald's twitter account tweeted 'In the absence of ketchup on our premises, we want to tell this to our fans' followed by a message saying it was trying to solve the problem as soon as possible

The crisis has now
 prompted people to panic buy perishable goods before the prices can 
rise any further or exchanging their pesos for U.S. dollars in a bid to 
protect their savings from further erosion.

Economist Nigel Tollerman, who lives in Argentina, wrote on his Facebook page: 'Know there's insane inflation when for the first time I'm buying double everything in the supermarket for fear of yet another price hike the following week... will soon be stockpiling basics for the storms further ahead.'

The
 Argentine government has introduced a number of restrictions on 
transactions with foreign currency and limiting imports to Latin 
America's second largest economy.

The strict rules have caused many investors to take flight and caused the economy to nose-dive.

The peso dropped 23 percent to 8 per dollar in January and trading on 
futures markets suggest it could sink to 8.78 per dollar in June.

Last year, Argentina saw shortages of basic products such as wheat, corn, tomatoes and cooking oil. Now it can add Ketchup to the list.
