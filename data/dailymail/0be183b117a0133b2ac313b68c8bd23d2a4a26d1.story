Furious MPs have attacked the City watchdog for delaying the release of a report into the collapse of Halifax Bank of Scotland until after the General Election.

The findings will expose the disastrous blunders of former bank executives, regulators, as well as politicians.

But they will now not be published until the summer at the earliest – nearly seven years since HBOS imploded after years of reckless lending, triggering a £20billion bail out from the taxpayer.

Bailed out: Halifax needed a £20billion handout from the taxpayers to stay afloat after years of reckless lending and investments led to its near collapse during the banking crisis nearly seven years ago

Business Secretary Vince Cable described the delay as ‘totally unsatisfactory’.

It comes after Sir John Chilcot said his report into the Iraq War will not be published until after May, winning a reprieve for figures in the Westminster establishment who are expected to be heavily criticised.

The Chilcot findings, like the HBOS report, are understood to have been held up by those likely to be criticised by the inquiry and who have used lawyers to defend themselves.

A section of the report will conclude whether the FCA should take action against individuals including disgraced former HBOS executives James Crosby, Andy Hornby and Lord Stevenson – all of whom were let off the hook by its predecessor the FSA.

This part of the probe is being carried out by Andrew Green QC, who was hired last summer after MPs raised concerns about the independence of the regulator’s findings.

Only one former executive, Peter Cummings, has been punished for his role in the downfall of HBOS, which was saved from collapse in September 2008, while Lloyds was bailed out weeks later. More than 46,000 staff have lost their jobs and Lloyds is still 25 per cent owned by taxpayers.

Mr Cummings, who ran Bank of Scotland’s corporate division, was fined £500,000 in 2012 and received a lifetime ban from the City for presiding over a reckless lending spree which ultimately led to £26billion of losses.

He has described it as ‘sinister and curious’ that he was ‘singled out’ while others escaped punishment.

The formal investigation into HBOS’s downfall was launched by the FSA in September 2012 after its enforcement probe into individuals at the lender was finally completed.

It was meant to be published the following year. But the FCA – which replaced the FSA in April 2013 – moved the deadline to the end of last year.

The latest delay is thought to stem partly from a process known as ‘Maxwellisation’ – named after the late newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell – whereby those criticised can challenge what is written about them.

The political sensitivity of the report is thought to be another reason why it will not emerge until after the election. It is expected to increase scrutiny on top figures in the Labour Party, including former Prime Minister and Chancellor Gordon Brown, who has been blamed for fostering the ‘light touch’ regulation that enabled banks to take huge gambles and behave with impunity.

His key advisers when he was in the Treasury included Labour leader Ed Miliband and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls.

The legal wrangling has dragged on since the autumn of 2013, contributing to the spiralling cost of the inquiry, which is expected to top £1million, including £228,000 for legal advice for regulators criticised in the report. 

Last night Mr Cable said: ‘We are now more than six years on from the banking crisis. The people whose livelihoods have been wrecked by the irresponsible behaviour at HBOS and other banks deserve better than this.’

He added: ‘Holding up this report prevents us from making judgement on whether there has been wrongdoing and fraud and whether more former executives need to be punished.’

Tory MP Mark Garnier, who sits on the Treasury committee, said: ‘Maxwellisation seems to have become a standard excuse for delay and inactivity on so many levels. But the FCA has run out of excuses. It is vital we hear the truth as soon as possible.’

Cathy Jamieson, a Labour Treasury spokesman, said: ‘We want this report to be published as soon as possible. Nobody will take any lectures from the Tories when they repeatedly complained the last government was too tough on regulation.’

The delay will be compounded by the fact the Treasury committee has to see a final draft of the report. Insiders believe there is virtually no chance the report will be ready before the committee is dissolved on March 30, ahead of the May election. It may not reconvene until September.

A spokesman for the FCA said: ‘We are committed to publishing the report as soon as possible but the legal process of Maxwellisation is currently under way and this can take some time.’ 

Facing criticism: James Crosby, left, and Andy Hornby 

 

James Crosby, 58

Dubbed Gordon Brown’s favourite banker, the Yorkshireman was credited with transforming HBOS into Britain’s biggest mortgage lender.

He was knighted in 2006, quitting HBOS shortly afterwards with a £580,000-a-year pension. Mr Brown appointed him as deputy chairman of the FSA the following year.

But a 2013 report into HBOS by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards described him as the ‘architect of the strategy that set the course for disaster’. He apologised, forfeited his knighthood and gave up a third of his pension.

Andy Hornby, 47

A former boss of Asda, Mr Hornby was chief 

executive of HBOS when it was bailed out. He was accused by the commission of being ‘unable and unwilling to change course’, persisting with the reckless strategy established by his mentor Mr Crosby.

He is now reported to receive more than £500,000 a year as boss of bookmaker Coral.

Lord Stevenson, 69

Earned £815,000 a year as chairman of HBOS from May 2001 until its downfall.

He infuriated the commission with the claim that the collapse of HBOS was not his fault because he was ‘only there part time’.

He has close links to New Labour and is a friend of former spin chief Lord Mandelson. He now runs a consultancy firm.
