Downing Street was last night facing a chorus of demands to bar MPs from policing their own affairs and sack minister Maria Miller

Downing Street was last night facing a chorus of demands to bar MPs from policing their own affairs and sack minister Maria Miller.

Senior figures from all main parties backed a call from the watchdog in charge of Commons expenses for MPs to be prevented from ‘marking their own homework’ when complaints are made.

Former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit and a grassroots party organisation said Mrs Miller, who was made to repay £5,800 in excess mortgage claims last week, should resign or be dismissed.

Anger over the Culture Secretary’s case has been compounded by the decision of the standards committee, made up of ten MPs and three lay members with no voting rights, to water down her punishment.

Kathryn Hudson, the independent parliamentary standards commissioner, initially suggested she should repay some £44,000 and said her designation of what had been her main home was incorrect.

No 10 said that David Cameron, who once suggested MPs’ expenses should meet a ‘smell test’ even if they were strictly within the rules, was not backing reform of the standards committee. A spokesman said: ‘He is happy with the system as it stands.’

But Sir Ian Kennedy, chairman of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, said the Commons must ‘give away powers in regulating itself’, insisting: ‘MPs marking their own homework always ends in scandal.’ 

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said he was ‘very open’ to ‘independent people’ being in charge of the process, saying: ‘This goes on and on and on, eating away at the credibility of Parliament. Whatever it takes to restore that credibility is vital.’

Angela Eagle, Labour’s shadow leader of the Commons, said: ‘We need a system which commands public confidence, and what we have at the moment clearly doesn’t do that.’

John Mann, the Labour MP whose complaint prompted the investigation into Mrs Miller, said: ‘Everyone who was in the last parliament was embroiled one way or other in the expenses scandal and therefore they can’t possibly sit in judgment on other MPs.’ 

The former anti-sleaze MP for Tatton, Martin Bell, told the BBC’s Sunday Politics programme that he agreed the committee on standards should be abolished.

He said: ‘The House of Commons ... is incapable of regulating itself and that’s been proven yet again.’

The investigation into Mrs Miller was prompted after she claimed £90,000 in mortgage interest and other housing costs for her taxpayer-funded second home in Wimbledon, south-west London, which was also home to her parents. 

She rented a smaller property in Basingstoke which she designated as her main home.

The central allegation against her – that she cheated taxpayers in order to subsidise the living costs of relatives – was dismissed.

But during the course of the investigation, it emerged that she had increased the size of her mortgage at least twice since becoming an MP and made a series of ‘overclaims’ which she blamed on administrative errors.

Correspondence released by the committee reveals she made repeated attempts to browbeat the commissioner into dropping inquiries into the broader question of her mortgage charges.

Mrs Miller won only lukewarm support from colleagues after issuing a curt 30-second apology in the Commons last week, and some ministers privately indicate they believe she should have offered to resign.

Lord Tebbit said: ‘Having staked his authority and reputation on defending his Culture Secretary against calls for her to be fired, the Prime Minister will be damned if he now fires her and damned if he doesn’t. The best way out of this is for Mrs Miller to resign.’ 

Ben Harris-Quinney, director of Conservative Grassroots, called for her to ‘go with immediate effect’. He said: ‘Maria Miller is a totemic example of the modern political class who hold no discernible character, talent  or integrity. 

‘The grassroots of the Conservative Party have no time for careerist politicians who not only do not support, but flagrantly oppose, conservative values once they are comfortably settled in Parliament and Cabinet. The longer she remains in her position the greater the damage.’

Digby Jones, former head of the CBI, said: ‘In a company environment, in a business environment, you’d be asking for a resignation.’ 

Commenting on suggestions that Mr Cameron wanted to keep Mrs Miller on because he did not want to lose one of only four women in his Cabinet, Lord Jones told BBC Radio 5’s Pienaar’s Politics: ‘I think it’s an absolute legitimate motive to say “I need more women in my Cabinet”.

But I’m sure he could have found another one, if you know what  I mean.’

Maria Miller’s allies yesterday claimed she was being treated more harshly by Tory supporters and the Press because she had been in charge of controversial reforms on media regulation and gay marriage.

Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘I think she has done a very good job in a very difficult set of circumstances with the Leveson Inquiry, which has stirred up a lot of media antipathy to her, I know, and also the gay marriage stuff.’

The Work and Pensions Secretary told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show: ‘There’s a lot of Conservatives out there who perhaps weren’t necessarily in support of it all so feel rather bitter about that.’ 

MP John Mann, who made the original complaint about her expenses, said the suggestion she was being demonised because of her policy responsibilities was ‘absurd’.

He added: ‘It’s desperate stuff and it’s wholly inaccurate. If that’s the best they can do it shows the problems they are in.’

A Survation poll for the Mail on Sunday found almost three-quarters of voters thought Mrs Miller’s apology was inadequate, and similar numbers felt Mr Cameron was wrong to offer her his support. Some 78 per cent thought she should lose her Cabinet seat.

Former Tory culture secretary David Mellor said: ‘I don’t think it matters if she resigns or not. Bless her heart, she won’t be missed if she goes and she won’t be noticed if she stays. 

‘What this is all about is, first of all, the judgment of David Cameron; secondly the integrity of Parliament.

‘I mean, the 30-second apology to the House, allowing a bunch of dim-witted backbenchers to roll her out of what an independent adjudicator had said. Who is behind this? David Cameron needs to take a long, hard look about what kind of administration he’s trying to run.’
