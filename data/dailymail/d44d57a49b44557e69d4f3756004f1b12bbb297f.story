Graphic diary entries that allegedly detail how a suspected serial killer stalked and raped his victims have been read out in court during the closing arguments of his trial.

Joseph Naso, 79, allegedly wrote descriptions of rapes and sexual assaults in the journal as far back as the 1950s, Marin County prosecutor Rosemary Slote said as she read from the journal's pages.

They allegedly contain accounts of Naso approaching women and offering them a ride home.

'Outside the front door I overpowered her and ravaged her,' read one entry set in London, the Marin Independent Journal reported. 'I couldn't help myself.'

Accused: Joseph Naso, 79, stands accused of killing four women between the 1970s and 1990s

Closing arguments: At his trial on Wednesday, Deputy District Attorney Rosemary Slote read from Naso's journal that allegedly gives details of how he stalked and raped numerous women

Other passages described incidents in Cleveland, Kansas City, Buffalo, Rochester, New York, Wichita, Kansas, and Berkeley, California.

Naso, a former photographer from Reno, Nevada, stands accused of killing four prostitutes, all of whom had matching first and last initials - earning the case the moniker, the Double Initial killings.

He is charged with killing Roxene Roggasch in 1977, Carmen Colon in 1978, Pamela Parsons in 1993 and Tracy Tafoya in 1994. He has pleaded not guilty to the murders.

Prosecutors have called some 70 
witnesses during the two-month trial as they sought to prove that Naso 
drugged and photographed his victims before strangling them.

The court has previously heard entries allegedly written in Naso's journal.

At his preliminary hearing last year, it was claimed that in entry after 
entry, Naso wrote how he would stalk and approach a 
woman, offer her a ride home and then 'put it to her', often in his car.

Another read: 'Girl in north Buffalo woods. She was real pretty. Had to knock her out first.'

Nevada Department of Public Safety Det. 
Richard Brown said the journal was filled with such descriptions, and 
that Naso used the word rape in other sections.

Naso was arrested after a routine 
check by probation officers of his Reno home in 2010 turned up numerous 
photographs of unconscious women in various states of undress.

Investigators also discovered DNA matching Naso's profile on at least one victim, Roggasch.

Naso characterized the photographs as his art and said all of his 'models' were willing participants.

In a bedroom in his home, 
investigators also found a 'List of 10' with written descriptions of 10 
women, including four references that prosecutors believe described his 
four victims.

Six other women referred to on the list have not yet been identified, but prosecutors say the investigation is ongoing.

Naso is acting as his own attorney and 
is scheduled to give his closing argument on Friday. He could face the 
death penalty if convicted.

Interruption: The trial was briefly stopped after a truck was found with the message 'Joseph Naso murdered by sister' scrawled across a back window in the jury parking lot

Plot: Larry Roggasch, whose sister Roxene was allegedly killed by Naso, said he just wanted to raise money

During his trial, he showed the jury dozens of photographs he took of weddings, landscapes and family members along with what he called 'glamour' or 'cheesecake' photographs of nude women. He said he never forced any of them to do anything.

Prosecutors, however, claimed he kept a list of his victims and mementos of his crimes.Â 

Closing arguments were delayed briefly as the court investigated a truck bearing the words 'Joseph Naso killed my sister' that was parked in the jury lot.

A district attorney's inspector and Naso's private detective looked into the matter and concluded no contact was made with jurors.
