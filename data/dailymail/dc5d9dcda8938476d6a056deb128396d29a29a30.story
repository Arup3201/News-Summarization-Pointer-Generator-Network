The man was handcuffed despite having been deemed unfit for detention or deportation by a doctor. He died while restrained to a hospital bed

Immigration staff have been condemned for a ‘lack of humanity’ over their treatment of an 84-year-old Alzheimer’s sufferer who died while shackled in handcuffs.

Alois Dvorzac was suffering from severe dementia when he was stopped trying to enter the UK at Gatwick airport last January.

A doctor who examined the Canadian wrote in his records: ‘Frail, 84 yrs old, has Alzheimer’s disease … demented. UNFIT for detention or deportation. Requires social care’.

But he was still sent to Harmondsworth immigration detention centre where arrangements were made to have him deported.

These plans were scrapped when a doctor declared the man unfit to fly and, a few days later, he was taken to hospital in handcuffs – which were kept on for five hours after his admission.

Only after his heart had stopped and cardiopulmonary resuscitation started were the restraints removed.

It was just one of a string of examples, uncovered by Her Majesty’s Inspector of Prisons, of the gravely ill being forced by border staff to wear restraints.

Other cases included a detainee who was wheelchair bound following a stroke but was handcuffed on a journey to hospital ‘for no obvious reason’. 

One dying man remained handcuffed while sedated and undergoing an angioplasty procedure in hospital.

Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: ‘Have the authorities responsible for Harmondsworth forgotten the basic principles of humanity and decency that must apply to any form of custody?’

Ministers have vowed to scrutinise more closely the performance of Harmondsworth contractor GEO, which also runs Dungavel House immigration removal centre in South Lanarkshire.

Removal centres are used for temporary detention in situations where people have no legal right to be in the UK but have refused to leave voluntarily.

Elsewhere in the report, inspectors said 11 detainees had been held at Harmondsworth for more than a year, including a man who had been held for almost two-and-a-half years, despite being willing to return to his country.

The man had lost contact with his family, so was unable to establish proof of identity.

HMIP described some of the rooms at the 600-capacity detention centre next to Heathrow as overcrowded, dirty and bleak.

Chief Inspector of Prisons Nick Hardwick said some of the most vulnerable detainees ‘had been utterly failed by the system’.

On at least two occasions, inspectors discovered elderly, vulnerable and incapacitated detainees were ‘needlessly handcuffed in an excessive and unacceptable manner’.

Inspectors warned insufficient weight was given to doctors’ opinions as to fitness for detention.The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman is preparing to investigate the incident involving Mr Dvorzac but is awaiting confirmation of the cause of death.

Immigration minister Mark Harper said: ‘The use of restraint in this case seems completely unjustified and must not be repeated.’

He added: ‘Clearly, performance by the contractor running Harmondsworth has been below the high standard expected.’
