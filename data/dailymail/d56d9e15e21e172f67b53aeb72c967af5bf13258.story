A 24-year-old man in southern California died early Sunday morning after falling out of a party bus onto a freeway and getting run over by several vehicles.

His family has identified him as CJ Saraceno, a Tufts graduate who moved to Los Angeles two years ago from his hometown of Watertown, Connecticut.

Mr Saraceno's father says he was out with friends to celebrate a friend's birthday when the incident happened around 12:20am.

Birthday tragedy: 24-year-old CJ Saraceno was killed early Sunday morning while celebrating a friend's birthday when he fell out of a party bus and was run over by cars on Hollywood Freeway. Above, an example of a party bus

Witnesses say he was changing the music near the front of the party bus when the vehicle made a quick turn and threw Mr Saraceno out of the bus and onto Hollywood Freeway, near Universal City.

Outside, Mr Saraceno was hit by several vehicles and emergency responders ruled him dead on the scene.

It's still unknown how fast the bus was going. About 23 people were on board at the time. The investigation is ongoing.

A representative for the California High Patrol issued a statement, saying how rare the accident was.

'In central LA, in the office that I've been at for six years, I've not heard of one incident in which a party bus was involved and a person ejected,' CHP spokesman Chris Baldonado told KTLA. 'I'm sure this isn't the first time it's happened.'

Mr Saraceno had been working for the past two years as a brand content strategist at NCLUSIVE, an event production and marketing firm.

On behalf of the company, CEO Jess A Richman expressed his condolences at the sudden loss of an employee.

'Our company is a family made up by every individual member and CJ was one of a kind from the day he walked through our doors,' Richman said. 'He is loved more than we can express. CJ and his words will never be forgotten.' Â
