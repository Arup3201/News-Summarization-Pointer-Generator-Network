More than 50 people watched a father beat his daughter in the middle of a road because he heard a false rumour that she was dating. 

Raja Ram grabbed his daughter by the hair before slapping and kicking her continuously near the Domlur flyover, India, around 8.30am yesterday. One of the silent bystanders was the girl's mother. 

The victim was only rescued after two female workers from a nearby firm wrestled Ram, a sub-inspector for Madurai police, off her and locked her in their car for more than 30 minutes.

Niveditha and Archana said they were on their way to breakfast when they saw the 'shocking' attack, the Times of India reported.  

After the incident Niveditha wrote on Facebook page The Logical Indian: 'On our way to [the] office, me and my friend Archana were shocked to see a girl aged about 25 being beaten black and blue by a strong well built man, with at least 50 people standing on the street and simply watching.

'He was grabbing the girl by her hair, slapping her, kicking her in the groin as she fell down on the road. 

'Archana started pushing the man while I tried untangling the girls hair from his fingers' (sic). 

The two women described how they initially tried to get a young man with a motorcycle to take the girl but Ram stole the keys.

They then tried to hire a rickshaw but Ram again got in their way. 

Eventually the two women locked the young girl in their car and called the police, who arrived half and hour later to find Ram sitting on the bonnet.

Niveditha said: 'The parents had heard rumours of their daughter having an affair and was hence "teaching her a lesson", refusing to listen to her or believe her denying the affair.

'The father wanted to take her back to Madurai, against the wishes of the daughter and forcibly marry her to someone of their choice.

'There were so many people standing by, if one of them had removed him from the car, we could have taken her to safety. But no one did.'  

When they got to the police station the girl decided that she did not want to file a complaint and Ram has been let go.

A police spokesman said: 'This is a minor incident and a family matter. Also, no complaint has been filed.'

There will be no further investigations. The Facebook post has since been liked by nearly 35,000 people.

It comes days after documentary India's Daughter, about a 2012 gang rape on a 23-year-old girl, was banned from being broadcast in India over fear it would fuel public anger.
