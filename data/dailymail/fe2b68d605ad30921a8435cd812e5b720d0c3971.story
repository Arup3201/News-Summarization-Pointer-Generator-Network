Ed Miliband’s new policy guru today spent more than 45 minutes railing against queue-jumping, the demise of the milkman and people who have adverts tattooed on their foreheads as he warned the Labour party there are some ‘public goods’ money cannot buy.

In a speech-cum-seminar hailed as ‘brilliant’ by the Labour leader, Harvard professor Michael Sandel asked delegates if they had ever tried to hire a friend, buy a best man’s speech for a wedding or pay a child to write thank you notes.

Blairite commentator Dan Hodges tweeted: ‘An afternoon with Michael Sandel is the most self-indulgent thing I've ever seen at a major party conference.’

'Self-indulgent': Harvard professor Michael Sandel told the Labour conference there was more to life than what money could buy

During the main event on the opening day of the Labour conference in Manchester, the US political philosopher also questioned the morality of paying someone for sex, to donate a kidney or to persuade them to go on a diet.

Mr Sandel also appeared to suggest it was wrong for wealthy parents to send their children to private schools.

But after attacking the worst excesses of capitalism, it was announced Mr Sandel was available to sell signed copies of his new book, What Money Can't Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets.

Mr Miliband seemed hugely impressed, slapping Mr Sandel on the back at the end of his performance, and telling him: ‘We have never had anything like that before. Brilliant. Brilliant.’

Money can't buy friends: Labour leader Ed Miliband hailed Mr Sandel's speech as 'brilliant'

In a rambling lecture, Mr Sandel prowled the stage and challenged Labour delegates in the sparsely-attended conference hall to wrestle with big moral questions.

‘In more and more domains of life it is possible to pay extra and jump the queue,’ he complained.

‘Increasingly it is possible now to hire someone to stand in a queue for you. This is a familiar practice for rock concerts, theatre, sporting events.’

He also pointed to the phenomenon of people who had the names of companies tattooed on their forehead as walking billboards, only for the firms to go bust.

‘A market society is a place where almost everything is up for sale,’ he said.

Mr Sandel complained that there was now nothing which was not for sale, including people's foreheads which were bought up as advertising space by internet firms

In Iraq and Afghanistan there were more paid military contractors on the ground than there were US military troops.

‘This doesn’t happen because we had a public debate about whether we wanted to outsource war to private companies. It just happened.’

But he insisted: ‘There are still today some things that money cannot buy. One such thing is friendship.

‘If you don’t have as many friends as you would like it might occur to you to try to buy some.

‘But you would quickly realise it might not work. Why not? Somehow the money that would buy the friend would dissolve the good you are feeling.

‘A hired friend is not the same as a real one.’

He then turned to wedding speeches, and websites which help people to write a toast by supplying information about the happy couple.

Mr Sandel denounced the idea: ‘The financial transaction to some degree erodes the expression.’

In a debate on the impact of supermarkets squeezing out small shops and farmers, one delegate said she paid for a milkman even though it cost more

Despite the economic pressures on most hard-pressed families, he even appeared to encourage them to spend more on their weekly shopping to sustain their local grocer.

‘Some worry that supermarkets dominate high streets in towns across Britain, what will become of the small local shops, the local grocer?

‘Will they be crowded out? Will big box stores decimate the high street trade? What about suppliers, farmers who are squeezed in the prices they get for their milk by big supermarket chains?’

Mr Sandel said it was important that people from different walks of life 'bump up against each other'

One delegate was applauded after saying she got her milk delivered by a milkman, even though it was more expensive.

After a brief discussion on the merits of banning advertising for children, which took in promotional campaigns for climbing trees and sugary breakfast cereal, Mr Sandel then questioned whether it was acceptable to use public money to persuade people to stop smoking, lose weight or taking their medication.

‘When should you use questionable motives to get people to do good things?’

He went on: ‘If someone is willing to pay for sex or to buy a kidney and a consenting adult is willing to sell, the only question standard economics is willing to ask is: how much?

‘It has drained our public discourse of moral and civil energy and contributed to the technocratic politics.'

He said wealthy people and those on modest means coming to lead increasingly separate lives.

‘We live and work and shop and play in different places, our children go to different schools.

‘This is not good for democracy, nor is it a satisfactory way to live even for those of us who may end up on the top.

‘Democracy doesn't require perfect equality but it does require that citizens share a common life.

‘It is important that people from different walks of life bump up against each other.

‘Do you want a society where everything is up for sale or are there certain moral and civil goods that markets don’t offer and money cannot buy?’
