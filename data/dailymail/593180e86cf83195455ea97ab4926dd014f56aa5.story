The FBI offered protection to a whistleblower who made corruption allegations against the Qatar 2022 World Cup bid because they believed she was in danger.

Phaedra Al-Majid, a former employee of the Qatar 2022 World Cup bid, told Sky News that she was approached by agents of the USA’s national criminal investigation organisation in September 2011 and told that they believed she was under threat.

‘I was watching TV, there were three FBI agents on my doorstep,’ she said. ‘They said, “we are here because you have received threats and we know the security of you and your children is being jeopardised, so we want to see what we can do to help you”.

FIFA whistleblower Phaedra Almajid claims she is now under FBI protection and fears for her life

Speaking in an interview, Almajid said she would be looking over her shoulder for the rest of her life

Almajid spoke exclusively to the Mail on Sunday last weekend and revealed how she had been treated

‘It was terrifying. They asked me questions pertaining to my time in Qatar, what I had observed, what I had witnessed and especially about the threats and affidavit.’

Al-Majid left the Qatar bid team in early 2010, nine months before they were awarded the 2022 World Cup, after becoming concerned at the conduct of the campaign.

She provided information to several journalists on condition that they preserved her anonymity. In the past year she has also given information to New York attorney Michael Garcia’s ‘independent’ inquiry into the 2018 and 2022 bids.

Her evidence was dismissed in a summary of the Garcia report published by FIFA ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert last week, which she believes effectively identified her and breached her confidentiality.

Speaking on camera for the first time, she said she does not regret speaking out.

‘If you are asking me do I regret being the Qatar whistleblower, it has cost me personally, it cost me emotionally,’ she said. ‘I know for a fact I will be looking over my shoulder for the rest of my life. It’s cost me security for me and both my children. However, I did witness something and believe I did have to say what I witnessed.

‘I had a lot of cyber attacks, a lot of them were directed to my children. I believe it was through the Qataris. They knew a lot of information about me that I don’t believe FIFA knew. I was a bigger threat to the Qataris than I ever was to FIFA.’

Al-Majid and fellow whistleblower Bonita Mersiades, who worked for Australia’s 2022 bid, have lodged separate formal complaints against Eckert’s 42-page summary.

‘I was shocked, immediately I was crying,’ added Al-Majid. ‘Every time I met with Michael Garcia he ensured me everything was confidential. It was agreed before I even met him that I would not participate in the investigation unless I was kept anonymous and everything was kept in confidence.

‘I had no reason not to trust him so I was in shock at what was done. I feel frightened because Eckert so calculatedly made sure that my identity was revealed.

‘Why has it happened? To silence any other whistleblowers and to intimidate me and Bonita so we will stop talking about what happened during the 2022 process.’

Eckert’s summary of Garcia’s 18-month investigation cleared Russia and Qatar to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, having found no serious breaches of bidding rules.

FIFA have been widely criticised for failing to publish the Garcia report in full. The Eckert summary puts more blame on England for the way they conducted their failed 2018 bid than on either of the controversial Qatari or Russian campaigns.

FIFA president Sepp Blatter is adamant that the full report cannot be made public and - while claiming not to have read it all himself - he has rejected FA chairman Greg Dyke’s call to publish. Replying to a letter from Dyke, Blatter said publication would break FIFA rules and Swiss law.

Blatter wrote that Zurich-based FIFA must respect confidentiality agreements under Swiss law and his organisation’s own rules prevent the disclosure of information that ‘violates the code of ethics’.

Dyke went on the offensive after the fiasco which saw Eckert’s summary disowned as a distortion of the original by Garcia, who said he would take a case of misrepresentation to the FIFA appeals committee.

Garcia and Eckert are due to meet today in an attempt to sort out their differences but it is unlikely that Blatter and Dyke will see eye to eye any time soon.

In his letter to Dyke, the 78-year-old Blatter did say that full publication ‘might be permissible if the persons and entities included in the report consent to such publication and waive any legal action they might be entitled to bring.’

He then asked whether Dyke’s request for full publication could be taken as a guarantee that all those involved from the England 2018 campaign would not be calling in the lawyers over the contents.

The fall-out has been extensive since FIFA on Thursday published a report investigating the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.

Here are the events since the release of a 42-page report by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, chairman of the adjudicatory chamber of FIFA's independent ethics committee, in his ruling on Michael Garcia's investigation.

NOVEMBER 12, 2014

FIFA announces the initial findings of the investigation into the bidding process for the next two World Cups will be published on Thursday morning, with England expected to come in for some criticism for the attempt to woo former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner.

NOVEMBER 13

England are indeed condemned for rules violations in their bid for the 2018 tournament, but Russia and Qatar are effectively confirmed as hosts for 2018 and 2022 respectively, the report stating any rule breaches by them were 'of very limited scope'. The Football Association rejects 'any criticism' of England's bid, with a spokesman saying: 'We conducted a transparent bid and, as the report demonstrates with its reference to the England bid team's 'full and valuable co-operation', willingly complied with the investigation.'

FIFA's chief ethics investigator Garcia announces he will appeal against the findings, saying the report contains 'numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions' in his original report.

NOVEMBER 14

Eckert admits his 'surprise' at Garcia's plans to appeal and adds: 'I will talk to Garcia but until then I will make no more statements.'

Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore claims it is 'grossly unfair' for England to have borne the brunt of criticism and adds: 'The Garcia report should be out there in full.'

American FIFA member Sunil Gulati and FIFA vice-president Jeffrey Webb from the Cayman Islands issue a joint statement also calling for Garcia's report to be published in full.

FIFA confirms receipt of Garcia's intention to appeal.

NOVEMBER 16

Former sports minister Sir Hugh Robertson claims FIFA ran a 'Wild West' bidding process for the two tournaments which encouraged would-be hosts to enter into inappropriate behaviour.

NOVEMBER 17

Football Association chairman Greg Dyke writes to FIFA executive committee members calling for 'urgent action' to ensure Garcia's report is published in full, claiming public confidence in FIFA has hit a new low and that there is 'compelling evidence' of wrongdoing.

Phaedra Almajid and Bonita Mersiades, members of the Qatar and Australia 2022 bid teams respectively and key whistleblowers in the original corruption allegations, register separate complaints against Eckert claiming his report breached promises of confidentiality. Almajid's statement labels Eckert's report 'a crude, cynical and fundamentally erroneous description of me and the information and materials I provided the investigation'.

Former Football Association chairman David Bernstein urges European nations to boycott the 2018 World Cup unless FIFA undergoes serious reform - including Sepp Blatter not standing for re-election as president.

NOVEMBER 18

FIFA lodges a criminal complaint with the Swiss attorney general over 'possible misconduct' by individuals in connection with the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. The move follows a recommendation by FIFA's ethics judge Eckert as part of his findings into the Garcia investigation on World Cup bidding.

FIFA president Blatter has insisted however that the lodging of the criminal complaint does not affect Eckert's statement last week that the investigation into the bidding process for the two World Cups is concluded. 

NOVEMBER 19

Whistleblower Phaedra Almajid claims her life is in danger and she is under FBI protection after her revelations to the original Garcia report became public.
