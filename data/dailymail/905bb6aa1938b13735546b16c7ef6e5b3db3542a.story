A married Hungarian couple who toured the world raiding the homes of the frail and elderly have been jailed after targeting pensioners in their 80s and 90s in Newcastle.

Husband and wife, Jozsef Forgas, 35, and Otilia Domotor, 37, had already racked up convictions for stealing from homes belonging to elderly people in Canada, Belgium and Hungary.

And since moving to Newcastle earlier this year they have been responsible for ten more burglaries - each time targeting and terrifying residents in their 80s and 90s.

Their vulnerable victims included a 93-year-old and an 88-year-old.

Forgas, whose many aliases include Kevin Kiss, has been jailed for four years while his wife, also known as Christina Kiss, was sentenced to 32 months, Chronicle Live reports.

Judge Brian Forster, at Newcastle Crown Court, told them: 'Because of your need for money you decided to target older members of the community.

'These were mean and shocking offences.'

A carer of a couple aged 93 and 83, became suspicious in May when Forgas and Domotor let themselves in - and had CCTV installed while also alerting police.

Less than a month later the carer arrived at the house to find Forgas and Domotor back again. 

Footage of the pair was circulated and the owner of their rented flat identified them, the court heard.

During this time, the professional burglars targeted another home which belonged to an 88-year-old man and his 84-year-old wife.

The elderly husband, who suffers from Parkinson's, had just returned from a physio session on May 28 when Forgas and Domotor turned up and let themselves into the property.

Stuart Graham, prosecuting, said: 'As seems to be the modus operandi for these defendants, the male Forgas engaged in conversation with the householder while the female asked to use the toilet.

'She was in fact looking for anything that could be stolen.' 

The victim said in a statement to the court: 'I'm nervous and worried they may come back to burgle my property.' 

Forgas and Domotor both of Chapel House, Newcastle, pleaded guilty to three counts of burglary and asked for seven other offences to be taken into consideration.
