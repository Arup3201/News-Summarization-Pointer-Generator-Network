Branislav Ivanovic has revealed how Jose Mourinho tore into his Chelsea players in Slovenia and admits a repeat of the performance will result in disappointment at Liverpool.

Mourinho was furious with what he saw during a goalless first 45 minutes in the Champions League against Maribor. He hauled off Andre Schurrle and Willian during the break and accused his team of being 'very slow' and lacking 'intensity' and 'creativity'.

'He was not happy and at half-time he showed it,' said Ivanovic. 'He told us exactly what he wanted in the second-half. We tried to play more offensive. He wanted to win the game and we tried to do that.

'For us, it was a massive game. It was very important and we didn’t win. It is a reminder. We know how our performance has to be to get the points. If we play like that against Liverpool, we know it’s not possible to win.'

Maribor took the lead early in the second half through Agim Ibraimi before Nemanja Matic equalised and Chelsea summoned a desperate finish. Eden Hazard missed a penalty five minutes from time and Diego Costa had a goal ruled out for offside.

It was close. Mourinho was convinced it was onside and was criticised Italian referee Daniele Orsato, but Ivanovic said: 'We didn’t perform how we know. In the end, with the penalty, we should have won. To be honest, maybe we didn’t deserve to win.

Mourinho was not impressed by Chelsea's poor start to the game and let his players know at half-time

Mourinho - and Didier Drogba - were not impressed by referee Daniele Orsato 

'We didn’t have enough stability in our game. When we conceded the game changed and we changed the shape, playing three at the back with more risk and we scored a goal.

'When you change the shape, you always have the risk of conceding a goal and that’s why in the second half we didn’t look how we normally do. We cannot be relaxed and we have to learn from every game.

'Every time when we come into the game relaxed and not play for 90 minutes we are struggling with results. So we have to be smart in that part and we have to play every game, 90 minutes.'

Chelsea are still strong favourites to qualify from Group G

Despite dropping points, Chelsea are in a healthy position. They are top of the Barclays Premier League and travel to Liverpool on Saturday. They are in the last eight of the Capital One Cup and are three points clear at the top of their Champions League group.

A win away against Roberto di Matteo’s Schalke next time out in Europe will secure a place in the last 16 with a game to spare, and they complete the group stage at home to Sporting Lisbon.

'We should have finished the group in Maribor,' added Ivanovic. 'But now it’s too late and we have to think about the next game in the Champions League. We will have the opportunity at home to kill it off.'
