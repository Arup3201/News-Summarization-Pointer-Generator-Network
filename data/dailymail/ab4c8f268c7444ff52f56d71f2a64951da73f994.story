She may only be two years old but Princess Estelle seemed all grown up as she arrived giggling and smiling on her first day at daycare.

In fact parents Crown Princess Victoria, 37, and Prince Daniel of Sweden, 40, seemed more nervous than their adorable daughter. 

Holding tightly onto her parents hands, the second in line to the Swedish throne behaved impeccably for the couple as well as the cameras as she toddled up to the entrance of her new pre-school in Stockholm.

Royal wave: Princess Estelle didn't look at all nervous on her first day at pre-school in Stockholm

The toddler looked adorable in a floral blue and white top, grey cardigan and jeans and had a pretty baby blue bow in her hair while the Crown Princess looked smart in jeans and a navy blazer.

Princess Estelle delighted the photographers with a beaming smile and royal wave, as Prince Daniel stared adoringly at his daughter.

Her mother was given the important task of carrying Estelle's smart red school bag.

Pretty as a princess: The royal family looked the picture of happiness as they arrived for Estelle's first day at a Stockholm school in Sweden

The little girl is second in line to the throne thanks to the rules of succession being changed to allow a Swedish monarch's first born to rule regardless of their gender.

Her mother Crown Princess Victoria, who married her former personal trainer Daniel in June 2010, is first in line. 

This is the latest family milestone after Estelle was christened in 2012 in the  marble splendour of the royal chapel in Stockholm.

Estelle was born in February 2012, weighing 7lb 3oz and bears the title Duchess of Ostergotland, a province in south east Sweden.
