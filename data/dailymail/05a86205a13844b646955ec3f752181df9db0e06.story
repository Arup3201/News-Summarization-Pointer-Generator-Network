A mother-of-one has spoken out about her experiences - good and bad - of being a surrogate for gay and infertile couples.

Jessica Szalacinski, a 36-year-old language teacher based in Nashville, Tennessee, has been a surrogate twice; birthing a baby girl in 2009 and a boy in 2011, both for gay male couples - which were 'joyous' experiences.

She was forced to walk away from her third surrogacy arrangement, however, after the 'rich, well-known' couple, led her to feel like 'a commodity', Ms Szalacinski tells Jane Ridley at The New York Post.

'I definitely come from breeding stock, and pregnancy is a relatively easy process for me,' she says. 'I entered into the whole thing with my eyes open. Nobody forced me to do anything.'

Ms Szalacinski, who has a 12-year-old son with her police officer husband, Eric, was first introduced to the concept when she saw a news report on the difficulties faced by gay couples wishing to adopt or foster children. Instead of 'picketing' for the cause, she decided to volunteer her womb for the purpose of surrogacy.

Initially, her son was enraged because he assumed his mother would be 'having sex with two men', and her husband thought she was 'crazy', but once everything was explained and carefully considered, all parties were on board.

Ms Szalacinski found David and Alex, a gay couple 
based in New York, through Surromomsonline.com, and instantly 'clicked' 
with them, bonding not only over the baby she would later birth for them
 - a result of David's sperm and Alex's sister's egg - but also their shared interests.

Gestational surrogacy uses In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) to create an embryo using the eggs from the prospective mother or donor and sperm from the father or donor that is then implanted in a surrogate.

This allows the intended parents to have a genetically related child.

The success rate varies widely based on the quality of the egg and sperm, as well as the age and health of the surrogate.

Gestational carriers are officially recognized in only 15 states and are illegal in some.

'[I] preferred a gay couple for selfish reasons,' she reveals. 'A heterosexual couple is coming to a surrogate already crestfallen because they’ve tried and failed.

'Going forward, a lot of their sense will be wrapped up with those kind of emotions and possibly some envy and jealousy. But working with a gay couple is joyous.'

Ms Szalacinski was paid $20,000 for the process, and underwent a 'full psychological' evaluation and a home visit', before giving birth to a healthy girl in Nashville, in 2009.

In the delivery room, the baby was whisked away as quickly as possible, before any 'biological urge' could present itself.

'I did hear a cry,' she says. 'But it was like hearing the neighbor’s kid crying. I think it would have been harder for me if I hadn’t bonded with the dads.'

Ms Szalacinski agreed to be a surrogate for the second time, for Art and Matt, close friends of Alex and David, and gave birth to their son in 2011; another healthy and happy experience.

In more recent times, she entered into a third arrangement, this time with a 'well known' and 'mega rich' couple from the entertainment industry, who she can't name for legal reasons - and who were due to pay her a 'significantly higher' fee than she had been offered previously.

'It was like hearing the neighbor’s kid crying. I think it would have been harder for me if I hadn’t bonded with the dads'

Unlike with the first two couples, she found it impossible to 'bond' with these people, who treated the process like 'a business transaction'; so much so that Ms Szalacinski started referring to herself as a 'commodity.'

Not only 
were the couple initially insistent on having a boy - testing the embryos
 five days after fertilization for gender - but when they eventually 
settled on two female embryos, they asked Ms Szalacinski to 'reduce', or terminate, one of them if they both 'took,' because they didn't want to raise twins.

Additionally, the picky couple were eager to choose a 'particularly attractive' egg donor, despite the fact that her eggs were 'sub-par', because, according to Ms Szalacinski, they were 'obsessed with looks.'

'I couldn’t believe that this kind of misogyny exists. My moral compass kept flicking off and I had to walk away,' she says.

Although her experience with this couple was a blot on her otherwise successful track record, Ms Szalacinski says she still feels 'incredibly' happy about the children she was able to provide the four prior dads.

Her decision to undergo this journey echoes the increasing popularity of the practice.

While wealthy American couples have been enlisting the services of surrogates in developing countries such as India and parts of Africa for some time now, surrogacy in the U.S. is becoming more common.

According to the Council for Responsible Genetics, the number of children born to gestational surrogates - carriers that bear no genetic link to the child they carry - more than doubled between 2004 and 2008, with just over 5,000 babies estimated to have been born via this delivery during that time period.

And in 2012 alone, 1,898 babies were born via a gestational surrogate, according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

Surrogate mothers can expect to make an average of between $12,000 and $25,000 for the service - much more in some cases - but laws around 'commercial surrogacy' vary widely according to state.

States which are most surrogacy friendly include California and New Jersey - where the highest number of surrogacy births occur - as well as Illinois, Arkansas and Maryland. Commercial surrogacy in New York is illegal, and Michigan, for example, forbids absolutely all surrogacy agreements.

Surrogacy has proven to be a popular route for wealthy couples and celebrities in the U.S. Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon and his wife Nancy were the most recent to welcome a child, a daughter Winnie Rose, via surrogacy last July.

Designer Tom Ford and his partner Richard Buckley had their first child, a son called Alexander, in 2012, and other notable stars to have taken this road include Hunger games star Elizabeth Banks and her husband Max, E! host Giuliana Rancic and husband Bill, actress Nicole Kidman and husband Keith Urban, Elton John and his partner David Furnish, Sarah Jessica Parker and husband Matthew Broderick, as well as Robert de Niro, Kelsey Grammar and Ricky Martin.
