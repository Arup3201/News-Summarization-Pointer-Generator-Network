Hartlepool have sacked manager Paul Murray following their shock FA Cup second-round exit at home to Blyth Spartans - after just 45 days in charge.

The 38-year-old former Pools midfielder had just seven games in the Victoria Park hot-seat having taken over from Colin Cooper.

Murray oversaw five defeats, one win and a draw during his brief reign with the club, who sit bottom of Sky Bet League Two and six points adrift of safety.
