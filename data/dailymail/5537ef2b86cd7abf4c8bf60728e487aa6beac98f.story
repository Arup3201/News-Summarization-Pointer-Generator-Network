Manchester United have missed the boat for top midfield target Arturo Vidal, amid claims in Italy that they failed with a near-£30million bid for the Juventus powerhouse.

Sources close to the Juventus board have told Sportsmail that the offer was made on Friday and that the answer from the Turin club effectively ended United's hopes of installing Vidal as the midfield general they so desperately need.

Juve bosses informed United they had set an August 15 deadline for reaching any agreement over a deal for Vidal and that trying to negotiate so near to the transfer deadline would leave them insufficient time for recruiting an adequate replacement.

It represents a massive blow for manager Louis van Gaal, who wanted Vidal's energy and physical presence to revitalise a pedestrian-looking midfield. 

United were held to a goalless draw at Burnley on Saturday to leave Van Gaal still awaiting his first competitive victory in charge at Old Trafford. 

But the Dutchman was handed a major boost on Monday morning when United won the race to sign Radamel Falcao from Monaco on a one-year loan.

Whole-hearted: Vidal's (centre) energy and passion are sorely needed in United's midfield

The striker will cost the club £12m for the year and the Colombia star follows Angel di Maria, Daley Blind, Luke Shaw, Ander Herrera and Marcos Rojo as United's new signings this summer.

The 28-year-old has yet to agree personal terms on his move from Monaco but that is expected to be a formality and he is on his way to Manchester in a private jet.
