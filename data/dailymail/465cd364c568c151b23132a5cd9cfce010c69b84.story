Jonathan Trott will take his first tentative steps back towards playing Test cricket by being named in an England Lions squad to tour South Africa in January.

The 33-year-old batsman who came home from last winter's Ashes tour after suffering a stress related illness has not played international cricket since.

But his success with Warwickshire, where he scored three centuries in the last month of the season, has encouraged him and the ECB to believe he is capable of touring again.

Since returning to action with Warwickshire, Trott has fired 1,156 runs and earned a new three-year deal

He signed a new three-year contract with Warwickshire on Thursday after enjoying a revival in form.

Trott made a delayed start to the campaign after a recurrence of the illness in April, but found form quickly after making his return for his county.

'Warwickshire CCC is a very special club for me and my family and I would like to thank everyone associated with the club for their support,' said Trott.

'It has always been a great honour to represent the Bears and I am delighted to commit to the club once again for a further three years.'
