Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny has been fined a reported £20,000 for smoking in the showers after a game.

The 24-year-old left boss Arsene Wenger furious when he was caught lighting up after his nightmare performance in the 2-0 defeat at Southampton on New Year’s Day.

It is not the first time the Poland international has been caught smoking and he was twice pictured with a cigarette in the summer of 2013.

Wenger has been outspoken on the subject in the past following incidents relating to Jack Wilshere -the midfielder was pictured smoking on holiday last summer - and William Gallas.

Szczesny was forced to apologise for his behaviour – and it is unclear whether he might also be axed from this week’s Barclays Premier League clash at home to bogey side Stoke.

David Ospina was in goal for the FA Cup win over Hull on Sunday and kept a clean sheet – with Szczesny not even picked on the bench.

That may have been pre-planned – the Polish keeper didn’t play in any of Arsenal’s domestic cup games last season. 

But Former Arsenal star John Jensen had claimed on Danish TV that Szczesny, 24, had suffered a bitter fall-out with Wenger and would not play again this season, although Arsenal denied that allegation and said Szczesny remains part of their first-team plans.

Arsenal striker Lukas Podolski, 29, has completed his move to Inter Milan on loan until the end of the season.
