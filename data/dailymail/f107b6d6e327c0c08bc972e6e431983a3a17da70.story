Police are looking for a thief who tried to steal a service dog from a woman with cerebral palsy – and the boneheaded attempt was caught on camera.

Surveillance footage caught the alleged crook Monday trying to steal a service dog from Arrica Okenka, 30, on a Toldeo, OH. bus.

Officials haven’t yet identified the suspect and are asking for the public’s help.

Thug: An unidentified man tried to steal a disabled woman's service dog Monday on a Toledo, OH bus

Okenka has had the dog named Ingrid for four years, and usually does not hold its leash. Monday she held tight as the would-be dog snatcher yanked in vein and then ran off the bus after a few unsuccessful pulls.

‘I wasn't letting go I had a death grip on her. He would have had to drag me off the bus with her,’ Okenka told WTVG.

Ingrid usually lies at Okenka’s side without her leash being held, even on the bus, because of how well trainedthe dog is, she told the Toledo Blade.

‘A lot of times, I don't have a hold of her leash, because she's so trained, I just let her lay down,’ Okenka told the paper, adding ‘once I realized what he was doing, I really wasn't letting go.’

The dog owner held the leash so tightly it cut her hand, she told WTVG.

The man tried to distract Okenka with a conversation about the dog, she told the paper, adding that he strangely hit the stop-request bell twice before the bus made it to a local shopping mall.

Ingrid helps Okenka with almost everything, from dressing and undressing to opening and closing doors, picking up things she drops and other routine tasks, she told the Blade.

Okenka was befuddled as to why the man would want Ingrid, telling WTVG that maybe he wanted to use her for fighting and wondering to the Blade if he thought he could sell the dog because of her training.

The dog would not be of much use to anyone else, Okenka explained to the paper.

‘She's trained to do them for me, you can drop things all day long and she's just going to look at you,’ Okenka said.

The disabled woman is happy to still have her beloved Ingrid, she told the paper, and plans to make sure no one can try to take the dog again.

‘She's so smart I almost don't have to put her on a leash. I do that because you're supposed to do it, you're supposed to leash your dog. And now I'll definitely keep her on that leash forever.’
