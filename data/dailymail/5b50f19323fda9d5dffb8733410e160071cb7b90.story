To appreciate society’s preoccupation with whiter teeth, one need look no further than our bathroom cabinets.

From electric toothbrushes and whitening toothpastes to home-bleaching kits and flossers, perfecting our smiles puts a rather large dent in our pockets.

But at around £600 professional whitening treatments are a luxury few can afford. So, can you get the same results for just £25 — without leaving your bathroom?

Hollywood smile: To appreciate society’s preoccupation with whiter teeth, look no further than your bathroom

That’s the claim being made by the manufacturers of a new whitening product, who say 100 women tried it for ten days — and all saw their teeth become five or more shades whiter.

The three-step Pearl Drops Pure White Whitening Kit comprises two serums — liquids in small pots with integrated brushes, rather like nail varnishes — and a toothpaste.

Paint on the brightener serum and leave it on the teeth for 30 seconds, before brushing the activator serum over the top and leaving for another 30 seconds.

Rinse thoroughly with cold water, then wait 20 minutes, before brushing for two minutes with the special toothpaste. And that’s it.

There are no trays to sleep in, no fiddly strips, and no sitting under a laser with a rictus grin.

So, how does it work?

‘There are two types of dental discolouration,’ says cosmetic dentist and Pearl Drops consultant Dr Abeer Al-Adhami.

‘These are extrinsic staining on the surface of the tooth, which can be polished off, and intrinsic staining, where the stain has actually been absorbed into the tooth and is more difficult to remove.’

To get rid of intrinsic staining, you need to bleach the tooth. During this process, the bleaching agent, which penetrates the surface of the tooth, reacts with the stain, making it transparent. The result is whiter teeth.

But what makes this new product better than other home- whitening treatments?

Professional whitening treatments tend to use the chemicals hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide as bleaching agents. But, in the UK, these can’t be sold over-the-counter in concentrations that will really make a difference.

Pearl Drops is using another bleaching agent — chlorine dioxide, more commonly used for purifying water — which works in the same way, and is found in some mouthwashes.

The chlorine dioxide is produced when the activator serum is applied on top of the brightener serum, and remains active for about ten minutes.

This breaks down the absorbed stains, while the special toothpaste helps remove the surface stains.

Pearl Drops suggest repeating the process once a day for ten days for best results.

It all sounds impressive, but does it really work?

Marie Baron, 50, a manager in the publishing industry from South-West London, tried the new product for ten days.

‘I had a brace as a child, so my teeth have always been one of my better qualities,’ she says.

‘But although I don’t drink red wine or smoke, because of my coffee habit — two to three strong cups a day — my teeth are not as white as I would like them to be.

‘Ten years ago, I had them professionally whitened and was really pleased with the results. But I haven’t been able to justify that sort of money since, and I’ve been wary of going somewhere cheap as you hear horror stories about your teeth being left feeling very sensitive.

So how did she find the new Pearl Drops product in comparison?

‘The instructions were easy to follow and the results after ten days were amazing,’ she says.

‘According to the chart on the box, my teeth went from shade 11 to shade four, and I didn’t notice any more sensitivity.

‘I think the improvement in colour is as good as when I had them done professionally.’

Dr Al-Adhami adds: ‘Leaving it on for longer, or using it more than once a day, won’t make your teeth whiter, or speed up the process.

‘There’s a maximum amount of oxidation that can happen within any 24-hour period.’

But one dentist we spoke to is wary about this new home bleaching treatment.

‘Using the product for longer than the recommended time might damage the enamel of the teeth,’ says Dr Uchenna Okoye, clinical director of the London Smiling Dental Group.

‘In the past, a lot of beauty salons offered cheap whitening treatments that used chlorine dioxide. It’s an effective whitening agent, but it is also very acidic.’

She adds: ‘Patients were initially delighted with the results, but soon found that, as the protective enamel had been worn away, teeth stained more easily, leaving them darker and more sensitive.

‘Thirty seconds may not be long enough to cause the damage but, without published data showing long-term effects, I’d be wary.’

Nevertheless, Mark Wrighton, from Pearl Drops, insists there is no cause for concern: ‘The pH of chlorine dioxide is around the same as orange juice, which means having it in contact with your teeth for 30 seconds and then rinsing it off does no more harm than drinking a glass of juice every morning.’
