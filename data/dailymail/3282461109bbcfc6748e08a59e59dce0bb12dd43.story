The tomb of a previously unknown queen has been discovered, Egyptian officials have revealed.

Unearthed by Czech archaeologists in Abu-Sir, south-west of Cairo, the tomb is thought to belong to the wife or mother of Pharaoh Neferefre who ruled 4,500 years ago.

Abu-Sir was an Old Kingdom necropolis used by the ancient Egyptian capital of Memphis. 

Forgotten queen: The discovery was made in Abu-Sir, south-west of Cairo,  and is thought to be 4,500 years old. The location of the grave has made archaeologists believe she was probably the wife of the pharoah

Here pyramids dedicated to Fifth Dynasty pharaohs, including Neferefre, can also be found. 

The location of the queen's grave, in Pharaoh Neferefre's funeral complex hints that she was probably the wife of the pharoah, however.

Egyptian Antiquities Minister Mamdouh el-Damaty said that her name, Khentakawess, had been found inscribed on a wall in the necropolis.

Mr Damaty added that this would make her Khentakawess III as two previous queens by this name were already known of.

An official at the antiquities ministry said the tomb dated from the middle of the Fifth Dynasty (2994-2345 BC).  

In December last year a 2,400-year-old coffin bearing unusual decorations, revealed the decline of Ancient Egypt.

'Goofy'? Experts believe the childlike paintings were made by junior artists

Its strange illustrations were described as ‘goofy’ and 'amateurish'.

Experts believe the marks were made by junior artists, after the best Egyptian painters were deported when the Persians controlled the region.

From 525 BC for around a century, the Persians ruled Egypt after king Cambyses marched into the Egyptian capital, Memphis, toppling the pharaoh.

The occupation meant that the Persian Empire stretched from what is now Turkey to Afghanistan.

The coffin could shed light on a tumultuous time in Egyptian history, in which ancient texts by Diodorus Siculus suggest the occupying Empire deported Egypt’s best craftsmen and artists to work on its own grand projects in Persia.
