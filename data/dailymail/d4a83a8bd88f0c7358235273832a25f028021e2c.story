Security guards and closed circuit camera systems will be deployed at 54 schools around Australia amid fears they could become the targets of violence, terrorist attacks or harassment stemming from 'racial or religious intolerance.'

Half of the schools selected for the $18million, three-year funding program are Islamic or Jewish schools. 

Federal Justice Minister Michael Keenan announced 54 schools have been approved for help protecting their students under the program, theDaily Telegraph reports.

In September last year youths allegedly shouted out threats to kill Christians and waved an Islamic State flag as they drove past a Maronite church and school in Sydney's west

Sydney teenager Abdullah Elmir, 17, is one of around 100 Australian men who are thought to have travelled to fight with the terrorist group Islamic State in Syria and Iraq 

‘This support recognises the unique security circumstances that some schools face,’ Mr Keenan said.

‘All our children have the right to be educated in a safe and secure setting.’

The funding promise was first made last year when the Attorney-General's Department invited schools to submit applications for extra security measures on their premises. 

'The Australian Government has committed $18 million over three years for the new Schools Security Programme. It is designed to provide funding to government and non–government schools and preschools assessed as being at risk of attack, harassment or violence stemming from racial or religious intolerance,' the Attorney-General's office said. 

'The programme will provide non-recurrent funding for security infrastructure, such as closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems, lighting and fences, and for the cost of employing security guards,' it added. 

Schools across Australia requested extra security assistance. Of those approved, 29 are in NSW and a large number of them are in Western Sydney. Victoria had the next-highest number of schools approved, with 15.

Half the schools are Islamic or Jewish.

The funding announcement comes after youths allegedly shouted out threats to kill Christians and waved an Islamic State flag as they drove past a Maronite church and school in Sydney's west last year, terrifying members of the community.

NSW police investigated the incident at the Our Lady of Lebanon church and the Maronite College of the Holy Family in Harris Park in Sydney's west in September.

It is alleged a youth in a passing red hatchback yelled out: 'We're going to kill all you Christians.'

Also in September last year, a Jewish school in Sydney’s eastern suburbs constructed a bomb proof wall.

Religious tension around Australia is thought to have been stirred-up by the actions of Islamic State jihadis such as Khaled Sharrouf (pictured)

The Yeshiva Centre in Bondi erected the concrete wall in front of its college, which houses kindergarten to year 12 students as well as a synagogue, classes for adults and a community kitchen.

Whilst Director Rabbi Dovid ­Slavin has been working towards breaking down barriers, he said 'building walls is the unfortunate reality' in Australia today.

The construction of the wall was reportedly funded by private donations and $519,000 granted the Secure Schools Program.

It came after a group of teenagers allegedly launched a tirade of anti-Semitic slurs when they boarded a bus in Randwick, Sydney's east, in August.

Children as young as five were among the busload terrorised on when the young men dressed in baggy pants and t-shirts boarded the bus at Randwick, just before 4pm.

Several students made frantic calls to their parents after the youths allegedly started yelling 'kill the Jews' and 'free Palestine', and 'Heil Hitler'.

Another incident involves residents in Bondi receiving anti-Semitic flyers in their letterboxes which urge 'white Australia' to 'wake up'.

The letters claim 'the Jews' encourage 'race mixing' and that they 'own' Hollywood and the majority of western media.

Last month it emerged that principals are struggling to deal with the students and parents who are falling under the sway of radical Islam, according to a group representing educators.

The Australian Principals Federation has welcomed the Victorian government's move to introduce new measures to deal with the growing problem in schools.

A state education spokesman said the department was working more closely with police and had nominated staff 'to provide advice and support to schools'.

It comes after one principal told Fairfax Media of his struggles to help two children whose parents have left Australia to Syria to fight with Islamic State in the Middle East at his state-run primary school.

'We have to work extra hard to ensure students don't take up their parents extreme beliefs,' he said.

'I have them singing the national anthem with the Australian flag and say what a lucky country they live in.'

The school is made up of a lot of children from the Shiite, Alawite and Sunni Muslim communities.

Since then, there had been a rise in suspensions of students as they fought at school.

The schools that have requested security assistance are based around Australia, with 29 of them in NSW and a large number of them in Western Sydney

'What's happening in the Middle East does impact here - the families are divided in their beliefs,' he said.

Australian Principals Association branch president Peter Kearney told Daily Mail Australia 'several issues' about 'social cohesion' had been raised by principals.

'One thing we see is that where there are tensions in the community then there are tensions in the school,' he said.

Mr Kearney said radicalisation of students and children had been 'a battle for principals' but they were unsure about how to deal with it.

The former principal's comments follow growing concerns for the vulnerability of teenagers being recruited by terror group Islamic State.

Abdullah Elmir - dubbed the Ginger Jihadi - who went missing from his western Sydney home has appeared in a number of recruitment video for the extremist organisation in Syria.

Another teenager who was suspected of having ties to terrorism was Numan Haider who was shot dead by police last year after he stabbed two officers in Melbourne.
