Roy Hodgson has urged his England assistant Gary Neville to give up being a TV pundit and become a full time coach when he takes a decision on his career in 2016.

Neville, who would be a contender to succeed Hodgson if he were to leave the England job after Euro 2016, has said that he will make a decision next year on whether to opt for the media or football management full time, recognising that he can’t keep a foot in both camps indefinitely.

If Hodgson wished to retire in 2016 and the team had been successful, Neville would be a natural replacement as England manager – but Hodgson hopes that when the time comes he will opt for coaching over his media work with Sky Sports.

‘From a selfish point of view, thinking about the importance good coaches are going to have in our game, personally would see him more valuable to me as an English football lover as a coach than as a pundit,’ said Hodgson. 

‘Punditry, to be honest, is not that difficult if you know a little bit about football. You don’t win or lose in punditry. You don’t have to deal with players. You don’t have the daily contact with them, you’re not coaching them. You’re just watching the game and giving your opinion.

‘But the fact that he’s so good at it, who knows? Maybe he’ll be under great pressure from Sky to keep that up. Maybe there won’t be any jobs that he wants to take. If you’re asking me personally would you like to see Gary Neville being a coach or a manger in the future, then of course I would.

‘He’d be a loss to England at the moment because he’s working with us. I don’t know what he’ll be doing in future terms. I think he’s a very good coach now. He’ll become an even better coach with experience. He’ll enjoy working with players. 

'I think players will enjoy working with him. I think from a selfish coaching orientated point of view I would like to see him in coaching. Of course, were I in the mass media TV world I’d be having a completely different argument. I’d be saying: “He doesn’t want to be doing that.”

‘He’s never actually said to me there is a cut-off point here where I’ll make a decision. But of course we talk a lot about what he wants to do because we talk a lot. We’re together all the time. I think he’s going to become a very fine coach. He’ll become a very fine manager also in time.’
