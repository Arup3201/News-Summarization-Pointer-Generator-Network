The memory of Sydney siege victim Katrina Dawson will be immortalised through a charity set up by her family to encourage education opportunities for women.

The family confirmed today that the Katrina Dawson Foundation had been registered, honouring the achievements of Ms Dawson, 38, who was described as one of the 'best and brightest barristers' at the NSW Bar before her untimely death.

Ms Dawson's brother, Sandy Dawson, said that her tragic passing during the Martin Place siege on Tuesday would not prevent her legacy from living on.

The family of Sydney siege victim Katrina Dawson have confirmed that a charity has been set up in her name

'As the city's poignant and continuing tribute to her and Tori Johnson shows, even people who did not know her do not wish the end of her life to be the end of her good work,' Mr Dawson, a well-known Sydney barrister, said today. 

The Foundation was established to 'preserve and honour the memory of Katrina Dawson and all she achieved'.

Former Governor-General Dame Quentin Bryce has been reported to be the founding member of the charity, with the move coming on the heels of a memorial fund for Mr Johnson.

'The foundation's focus is particularly appropriate because education, and particularly women's education, was something incredibly important to Katrina and in which she achieved true excellence,' said Mr Dawson.

During her school career, Ms Dawson scored a perfect 100 in her HSC, attending Ascham Girls School in Edgecliff, reported the Sydney Morning Herald. 

The school is planning to plant a tree in her memory, with the principal of the school revealing that her Details of the devoted mother-of-three have emerged in the wake of the week's tragic events, which claimed the lives of three people, including Ms Dawson, Lindt Cafe manager Tori Johnson, and gunman Man Monis.

Ms Dawson was visiting the Lindt cafe with her colleague Julie Taylor, her colleague at Eighth Floor Selborne chambers on Phillip Street, when Man Haron Monis took 18 people captive for more than 16 hours. 

Ms Dawson was killed after hostages staged an escape attempt around 2am on Tuesday morning.

'Katrina Dawson was the most wonderful person I have ever met,' Ms Taylor said. 'She was my closest friend, a role model and confidant.

'Her bravery and strength was, and continues to be, a comfort and inspiration for me. he invested every moment of her life in her friends and family, and will be greatly missed by everyone who has known her.

Ms Taylor said she had also taken comfort from the huge outpouring of public support - particularly from the huge flower memorial that has been established in Martin Place

'My thoughts and sympathy are with her family, whom I have come to know and love.' 

Ms Taylor said she had also taken comfort from the huge outpouring of public support - particularly from the huge flower memorial that has been established in Martin Place.

Tens of thousands of posies and handwritten messages have been placed at three sites across the plaza, in what has been dubbed 'Sydney's floral heart'.

Among the messages was a note written by Ms Dawson's youngest daughter, Sasha, which said simply: 'I love you mum. Love Sasha'. 

The coroner released Ms Dawson and Mr Johnson's bodies to their families on Thursday night, who are beginning the process of planning memorial services for the dead. 

Ms Dawson's family will remember the talented barrister in a memorial service scheduled for next Tuesday at Sydney University, where she studied law. 

The family has asked that those attending to donate to the Katrina Dawson Foundation instead of bringing flowers, and to wear Ms Dawson's favourite colour aqua, reported The ABC.
