A teenager has lost a whopping seven stone after discovering she was too plump to fit into her prom dress.

At 17st, Amy Pratt, now 20, was unable to fit into her size 24 frock, the biggest dress available. Distraught, she decided to join WeightWatchers in a bid to shed a stone and squeeze into her gown in time for the prom.

Four years on, 5ft 7in Amy is now a slimline 10st and will appear on the cover of WeightWatchers' glossy magazine.

Amy Pratt, 20, lost more than 7st after being unable to fit into a size 24 prom dress

Amy, from Tameside in Greater Manchester, joined WeightWatchers in 2009 as a last resort after years of feeling uncomfortable in her own skin. 

The teenager had fallen into a vicious circle of comfort eating and faddy dieting in a bid to quell feelings of self-doubt and as a result weighed more than 17st at the age of 16.

'It was hard going to that first class, especially as I hadn’t weighed myself in a very, very long time,' revealed Amy.

'But after I stood on the scales, uncomfortable though it was, I felt relieved. The prom was eight weeks away and I just wanted to fit into that dress.'

By the time prom day arrived, the dress was too big. 'I lost half a stone in the first week,' she adds. 'That was such a big incentive.

'Seeing the changes in my body motivated me to continue after the prom. It wasn’t always easy. There are times when you feel fed up after trying really hard and you only lose 1lb in a week. It’s the small changes that make a big difference and focusing on portion size.'

Amy then went on to lose more than seven stone gradually over two years and looks every inch the model as she graces the cover of WeightWatchers magazine.

During the photoshoot in London, Amy was also given the chance to meet the slimming organisation's ambassador, actress Patsy Kensit.

Amy, who works in business administration at the Co-operative Group’s head office in Manchester, said: 'I didn’t have much confidence before and I’m sure losing weight contributed to me getting my job.

'I’m the happiest I’ve ever been. I enjoy my job and I’ve got a boyfriend. Life’s great.'

Amy’s WeightWatchers leader Eleanor Murdoch added: 'Amy has shown a quiet and steady determination to reach her goal even when faced with the ups and downs that life throws at you.

'She has grown into a confident and beautiful young woman who is an inspiration to myself, her fellow members and her work colleagues, friends and family.'
