A mother is
facing child abuse charges after she starved her three-year- old son to the point
that he went into cardiac arrest.

Arlena
Alanz, 28, is alleged to have tied the special needs toddler to his crib with a rope to stop
him from climbing out.

The severely malnourished boy weighed
just 26lbs when he was finally taken to a hospital in Houston, Texas on October 2.

Abuse: Arlena Alaniz, 28, has been charged with injuring a child after her three-year-old child, who has special needs, was starved and tied up at her apartment in Houston, Texas

Authorities found the boy after Alaniz called emergency services to her dilapidated apartment in a west Houston complex when the child stopped breathing, said Houston Police Department spokeswoman Jodi Silva.

Doctors
said that the child was in cardiac arrest and suffering from severe 'failure to thrive'.

The boy was covered in bruises and cuts and at one point it was thought he would not survive.

Investigators who interviewed the boy’s four-year-old brother said his
mother hit the younger child because he was always crying.

The disabled child has to be fed through a feeding tube but after it fell out, Alaniz taped it to
his face to keep it in place.

During an
interview with child protection officers, the single mother said she was unaware how her youngest
son suffered multiple injuries.

She also
told detectives that she suffered from depression and took sleeping pills every night.

Neighbours
who know the family told police that they weren't aware Alaniz had a second
child because they never saw him.

Doctors told investigators that the child's condition is consistent with abuse.

Both children are now being cared for by Child Protective Services and are said to be doing well.

Alaniz was charged with injury to a child at Harris County Jail on $20,000 bail. She is scheduled to appear in court later today.

She has previously been convicted for driving while drunk.
