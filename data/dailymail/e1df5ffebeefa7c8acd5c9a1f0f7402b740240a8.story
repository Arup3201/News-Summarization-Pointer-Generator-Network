Houston coach Gary Kubiak suffered a ‘mini-stroke’ when he collapsed while leaving the field at halftime of the Texans' game against Indianapolis on Sunday night.

Kubiak was rushed to hospital and spent Monday undergoing a battery of tests which concluded that he had suffered a Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), often referred to as a ‘mini-stroke.’

TIAs don’t generally cause permanent brain damage or loss of motor function, but they are considered a serious warning sign and about a third of people go on to suffer a stroke within a year.

It remains unclear how long Kubiak, 52, will be away from the team, but he is expected to remain in hospital for at least another day.

‘TIA is a warning stroke and gives a patient time to act and keep a permanent stroke from occurring,’ Dr. Emil Matarese of St. Mary’s Medical Center in Langhorne, Pa. told the American Stoke Association's website.

‘By recognizing TIA symptoms and getting to the hospital, the patient can get help in identifying why the TIA occurred and get treatment - either through medication or surgery - that can prevent a stroke from occurring.’

Fortunately for Kubiak he was able to received immediate attention from medical staff at the Texans' stadium and was quickly transported to hospital where he was given Tissue Plasminogen Activator, which breaks down blood clots in people who suffer strokes.

Houston Texans coach Gary Kubiak - just 52 - suffered a Transient Ischemic Attack which could lead to full-blown stroke within a year if not properly treated

A Transient Ischemic Attack is often referred to as a ‘mini-stroke’ because it is caused by blood clots just as stokes are.

The key difference is that in a TIA, the clots clear more quickly.

Most TIAs last about one minute, and generally don’t last longer than five minutes.

TIAs don’t generally cause permanent brain damage or loss of motor function, but they are serious warning signs and lead to a higher probability of strokes in the future.

About a third of those who have TIAs suffer strokes within a year.

Medical experts refer to a TIA as a 'warning stroke' that gives a patient time to act - either through medication or surgery - to prevent a stroke from occurring.

The coach's diagnosis is being treated as ‘good news in the relative sense’ by his employers.

'It is treatable, which seems to be the reason for the optimism when you talk to Texans people,' reported NFL Media Insider Ian Rapoport.

Texans general manager Rick Smith released a statement on Monday in which he said the team's primary concern was Gary’s health and well-being.

‘There have been so many people 
throughout the city and across the country that have reached out to 
express their love and support and we are thankful for everyone’s 
thoughts and prayers. Gary is alert, coherent and in good spirits. He 
is continuing to be evaluated and monitored.’

There is no clear timeline for Kubiak’s return, nor has the team announced any plans for an interim head coach.

Defensive
coordinator Wade Phillips, who has been the head coach for the Denver 
Broncos, Buffalo Bills and Dallas Cowboys in his career, took Kubiak’s 
place in the second half of the loss to the Colts.

The Texans are scheduled to travel to face the Arizona Cardinals on Nov. 10.

The Texans lost Sunday's game 27-24 after 
leading 21-3 prior to Kubiak’s collapse. It was the team’s sixth 
straight loss after opening the season 2-0 with Super Bowl hopes.

Defensive coordinator Phillips took over for Kubiak in the second half and described the trying situation.

‘We had to adjust as far as the head coach not being there,’ Phillips said. ‘But, it was a shock to everybody.’

Kubiak has long been known as a top offensive coach, mentoring 
quarterbacks in Denver under Mike Shanahan and now Matt Schaub - and 
Case Keenum - in Houston. Kubiak has had no known public health 
problems.

Kubiak was hired in 2006, along with general manager Rick Smith, after 
the Texans finished a franchise-worst 2-14.

Smith spent 10 years with 
Kubiak while the coach was offensive coordinator of the Broncos. Smith 
was Denver's defensive assistant for four seasons before moving into the
front office for his last six years with the Broncos.

The pair has helped transform the Texans, which began play in 2002, from
league laughingstock to contenders. The team went 6-10 in their first 
year and 8-8 in each of the next two seasons.

Expectations were high in 
2010 after Houston finished at 9-7 for its first winning record in 2009.
But the Texans instead fell to 6-10, which led to many fans calling for
Kubiak's firing.

His original contract was due to expire after the 2010 season, but owner
Bob McNair has stepped up to keep Kubiak and defended him several times
amid the bumps.

Among recent departures were assistant head coach Alex 
Gibbs (for Seattle) and offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan went to join
his father, Mike, in Washington.

Kubiak hired former Denver offensive coordinator Rick Dennison to 
replace Shanahan and former Atlanta offensive coordinator Greg Knapp to 
become Houston's quarterbacks coach.

Dennison worked on the Broncos' 
staff during Kubiak's 11 years as Denver's offensive coordinator, and 
Knapp coached Schaub for three seasons with the Falcons.

The highest-profile assistant brought to Houston was Phillips, the 
veteran son of Bum Phillips and a former head coach in Dallas.

Last year, the Texans announced contract extensions for both Smith and 
Kubiak, rewarding them for taking the team to the playoffs last year for
the first time. Kubiak's three-year agreement has him under contract 
through 2014.

McNair said at the time he offered Kubiak a four-year deal, but the coach preferred to make it for three.

Kubiak made his mark as Denver's offensive coordinator under Shanahan, 
winning two Super Bowls. An eighth-round pick out of Texas A&M, he 
spent nine years as John Elway's backup. He finished his career 4-1 as a
starter, all in emergency relief of Elway.
