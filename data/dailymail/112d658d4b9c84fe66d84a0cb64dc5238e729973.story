Democrats in New Jersey outnumber Republicans by 700,000. But Chris Christie, the state's swaggering GOP governor, won re-election easily on Tuesday night in what was certainly a preview of his presidential aspirations.

'I know that if we can do this in Trenton, New Jersey,' Christie told supporters after his landslide victory, 'then maybe the folks in Washington, D.C., should tune in their TVs right now and see how it’s done.'

Christie, a political moderate in every way, prevailed by a wide margin in a year when establishment Republicans have been steamrolled in public by tea party partisans.

His success came via voting blocs that have traditionally been in Democrats' corner, giving GOP insiders hope that President Barack Obama's two victories might be historical anomalies rather than trends in the making.

Two terms: Christie hasn't pledged to serve out his second term as New Jersey's governor, leaving the door open for a 2016 presidential run

Everybody loves you now: Christie won a landslide victory over Democrat Barbara Buono, cementing his bipartisan appeal and making him a virtual shoo-in for presidential favorite status in the GOP

'We’ll be led back by our governors, and Chris Christie is now at the forefront of that resurgence,' former Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie told The New York Times on Wednesday.

'He’s proved that a conservative Republican can get votes from Hispanics and African-Americans, that a pro-life governor can get votes from women. This means that those voters are available to us, that we’re not shut out demographically or geographically – that it’s worth the effort.'

The larger-than-life Christie already casts a nation-sized shadow, but his national profile is set to grow even bigger this month when he takes over the leadership of the Republican Governors Association.

That position affords him some control over which state-level candidates the party's machine will endorse and financially support state candidates the party will support – giving him key leverage in advance of the 2016 presidential cycle.

And in order to store up favors, Christie is hitting the road.

Larger than life but smaller than before: Christie's hirsute form has shrunk in the last eight months following lap-band surgery to control his weight. Shedding pounds will also make him a more appealing White House hopeful

Christie said Wednesday that he would be popping into 'places like Ohio and Michigan and Florida,' states with both contentious gubernatorial races and key electoral votes for the next presidential victor.

Observers expect Christie to support moderate candidates at the expense of tea party stalwarts.

A GOP strategist told MailOnline on Wednesday that the tea party surge still has momentum at the state level, but 'the future of presidential politics belongs to the party's centrists.'

'Reading the tea leaves,' he said, 'it seems that 2016 is Christie's for the taking, and that's good news for Republicans. Tea party be damned, the next GOP presidential primary season will be the anti-2012. And Christie's not going to be a milquetoast-y centrist like Mitt Romney. He's as bold as Ted Cruz but as universally appealing as Bill Clinton.'

'This is a guy who has shown that a moderate in a blue state can sweep aside left-wing opponents by the sheer force of his personality. If we could just clone him a dozen times, we'd keep the White House until the second coming.'
