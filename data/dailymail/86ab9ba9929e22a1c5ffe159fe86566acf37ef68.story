A reality TV show starring a bikini-wearing girl group who fans can date and even marry has been launched in Japan.

The four-member band based in Tokyo - called Happening Girls - only ever appear in public wearing bikinis or swimsuits.

Male fans can apply to their TV show producers Kandou TV where they take part in X Factor-style auditions and interviews to see if they are suitable to meet and date band members.

Show spokesman Teruki Aoki explained: 'We are positively encouraging our fans to meet and date the girls.

'How they get on and how far they go is up to them. But they're contracted to let us into their private life and share in their relationship.

'They're free to have fun, develop, date and even marry if they want to. We'll be there to record the marriage aptitude interviews and we'd be delighted to arrange the wedding.'

The current line-up of the band are to be joined by a rota of girls who will all take their turn as members

The current line-up - Manaka, 20, Saaya 22, Kaori, 26, and 25-year-old Eri - are to be joined by a rota of girls who will all take their turn as band members.

Adverts in Japanese showbiz papers say band applicants should be aged between 17 and 30, live in Tokyo and have no objections to wearing bikinis in public at all times.

Mr Aoki explained: 'There are lots of idol groups in Japan but until now there were none wearing swimming costumes, and what young male fan wouldn't like to see their idol in a bikini?'
