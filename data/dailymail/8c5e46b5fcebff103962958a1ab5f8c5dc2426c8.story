A man has been arrested after allegedly stuffing his 5ft 10in girlfriend in a suitcase because she dumped him.

Wang Ke reportedly tied up Mu Ma after she broke up with him at a hotel in the city of Xi'an in central China's Shaanxi province.

He then bundled her into a suitcase, before paying for drivers to take him back to his home in the city of Shenyang in Liaoning province, it is claimed.
