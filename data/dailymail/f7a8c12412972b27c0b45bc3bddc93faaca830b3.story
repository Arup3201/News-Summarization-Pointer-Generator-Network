Accused: Police officer Sergio Alvarez has been arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and raping at least six women in West Sacramento, California

A policeman has been arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and sexually assaulting at least six women.

Sergio Alvarez, 37, is even accused of using his patrol car to carry out some of the attacks while on duty in West Sacramento, Calfornia.

The father-of-three was put on administrative leave in September after a woman came forward with allegations against him.

She told officers that Mr Alvarez threatened to arrest her if she did not commit sexual acts on him.

Police say most of the alleged victims were assaulted in the West Capitol Avenue area of the city.

Mr 
Alvarez is alleged to have assaulted the 
women after stopping them at night or early in the morning while on 
patrol in the city.

An investigation has revealed that there are at least six alleged victims, ranging in age from 20 to 47,  the Huffington Post reports.

Mr Alvarez is understood to have served on the force for five years.

He was fired and arrested following an internal investigation.

West Sacramento Police Chief Dan Drummond said he was 'appalled
 and sickened that someone who was put in a position of trust would 
violate that trust in such an egregious manner.

'The whole department is 
appalled,' he said.

WPTV Channel 5 reports that the allegations have led the department to review some its policies, including allowing officers to patrol alone at night.

'We want to make sure we are doing 
everything we can to make sure this does not happen again,' he said.
