Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has spoken to Sportsmail's Pete Jenson ahead of their Champions League last-16 showdown with Barcelona.

Here are the top 10 quotes from the interview with the Chilean boss.

Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has spoken  to Sportsmail's Pete Jenson

Pellegrini on Manchester City's triumphs last season going unrecognised 

'We were fighting on all fronts. We won the Capital One Cup, reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup, played in the Champions League and we won the League scoring 157 goals. Liverpool only had one competition and that's an enormous advantage.' 

Pellegrini on Liverpool getting the attention

'The slip from (Steven) Gerrard? They lost that game 2-0, not 1-0. If he had not slipped, does it end in a draw? We'd still have been two points ahead of them. So why was it Liverpool losing the league and not us winning it?'

Pellegrini on being told to buy English players

‘It is important to have English players but can you sign them? Can you get (Raheem) Sterling? Maybe if you go to Liverpool with £100million you can. If I want an English player in the position of (David) Silva who is there? Maybe (Wayne) Rooney, but who else?'

Pellegrini on European silverware

'Manchester United in all of that great era under (Sir Alex) Ferguson only won two Champions Leagues. Real Madrid went 32 years without winning the European Cup. It is important to be there in the later rounds but you can't think that not being there is a disaster.'

Pellegrini on Barcelona

'You can talk about tactics and technique but if you go a man down against Barcelona, you're put in a terrible position. It is not a disgrace to get knocked out by them. Their squad, if it is not the best in the world, it is the second best. No other team can put together Leo Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez but I want to play them with 11 and if they knock us out then let that be because they were better than us.' 

Pellegrini on his days as a centre back before becoming a manager

'If you want to say I was a disaster of a player then say it. But give me another disaster of a player who played almost 500 games across 14 years.' 

Pellegrini on Manchester City's riches

'This year Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United have all spent more than us. People don't accept that we are trying to become a big club in a very short time. I don't think there's such a difference between the top five or six squads.' 

Pellegrini feels English clubs aren't helped in European competitions by the domestic fixtures during winter

Pellegrini on the festive fixture list 

'English football gives other leagues an advantage. There are some traditions you can't change, I realise that. Boxing Day is non-negotiable. But you can't play nine games in December and nine in January. You have to stop at some point.'

Pellegrini on James Milner

'It would be very difficult to find a more complete player than Milner. There are players who are better technically. There are quicker players. There are players who head the ball better. But show me a player who does all the things that Milner does well and there isn't one.

'You leave him on the bench and he is furious, but watch him during the game, encouraging and shouting. And in the next training session he kills it for 95 minutes. It's very difficult to find another Milner – an intelligent player, with big balls and a massive heart.' 

Pellegrini on pressure in England compared to in Argentina

'Here the pressure is normal. There, it's every day, and it's life and death. I've never had a problem with pressure because I believe in my own ability. Last year I wanted to show I could win a major league in Europe. This year the challenge is to repeat the title or to do better in the Champions League.'
