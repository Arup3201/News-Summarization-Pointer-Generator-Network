It is an amazing view of one of the most incredible volcanoes on Earth.

This image from over the Azores island of São Miguel features a volcanic complex called the Sete Cidades Massif.

The circular crater or caldera dominates the image and measures about 5 km across. 

The interior has lakes, volcanic cones, lava domes and maars – or shallow, flooded craters.

This image taken by the Spanish Deimos-2 satellite on 6 December 2014 was taken over the Azores island of São Miguel features a volcanic complex called the Sete Cidades Massif. The circular crater or caldera dominates the image and measures about 5 km across.

Kelsea Brennan-Wessels from the ESA said it was a unique structure.

'In the surrounding area we can see the lines where there are agricultural plots.'

The Lagoa das Sete Cidades – or Lagoon of Seven Cities – is comprised of two ecologically different lakes that are connected by a narrow passage, visible at the centre of the image. 

The lake to the north is known as the Blue Lake while to the one to the south is the Green Lake for the colours they reflect.

'According to the legend, the protected daughter of a king escaped to the surrounding hills, where she met and fell in love with a young shepherd,' said Brennan-Wessels. 

'When the shepherd asked the king for his daughter in marriage, the king refused and forbade his daughter from seeing the boy again. 

'The two met secretly one last time and cried until their tears filled the valleys to form the two lakes: one green as the Princess's eyes were green, and the other blue like the shepherd’s eyes.' 

This image, also featured on the Earth from Space video programme, was acquired by the Spanish Deimos-2 satellite on 6 December 2014. 

With its high-resolution optical imager, the satellite can see down to a 75 cm ground resolution.

The ancient story recounts the tale of a bad-tempered widower King and his daughter in a Kingdom in the Western Sea. 

He was a King, Lord of Alchemy and sorcerer, who lived exclusively for his daughter, Antília, and who would not let the Princess speak to anyone. Apart from the King, the Princess was raised by an old nurse, after the Queen had died. 

As the years progressed, the princess grew-up to be a beautiful young woman and able to attract the attentions of any boy in the kingdom. However, the King restricted her movements to the castle and garden, and few ever saw her. 

But, un-intimidated by her father, and with the help of the nurse, she escaped to the local hills and valleys, as her father slept after his lunch. During one of her escape adventures, she heard a song: the music was beautiful and enchanted her to follow it to its origins. Hiding from view, the princess found a young shepard playing a flute, sitting on top of a hill. 

For weeks she returned, listening to the young shepard, until she was discovered behind some bushes. 

The shepard boy fell in love with the princess, and they continued to meet afterwards, talking, laughing and enjoying each other's company, until the boy decided to ask the princess in marriage.

Early in the morning, the couple knocked on the door of the Castle, and asked the servants to speak to the King. Very nervous but determined, the shepard asked the King for his daughter in marriage. 

Reacting angrily, the King refused and expelled him from the Castle, and forbade his daughter from seeing the young boy. 

Not wishing more ill-feelings, she followed the orders of her father, but met secretly with the shepard that afternoon in order to tell him that he would never see him again. 

Antília and the shepard boy cried all afternoon, embracing, and their tears formed two beautiful lakes, one green, for the Princess's eyes were green, and the other blue, for the shepard's eyes were likewise colored.
