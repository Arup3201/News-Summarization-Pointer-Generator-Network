A young British jihadist who appeared in a chilling ISIS recruitment video has posted photographs of the destruction caused to a Syrian army base by one of his homemade bombs.

Nasser Muthana - the 20-year-old former Cardiff schoolboy who featured prominently in ISIS' first professionally produced English language propaganda video - uploaded before and after images of a military building being destroyed in an ISIS-controlled area in the north of the country.

The images come just a month after the young jihadist posted a message on Twitter warning that the UK government should be afraid of him returning to the country with his new bomb making skills.

Before: Former Cardiff schoolboy Nasser Muthana uploaded images with the stark warning: 'Army base buildings before and after, I'm getting good with these bombs'

After: The young jihadist, who describes himself on Twitter as a 'soldier of the Islamic State', said last month the UK government should be 'afraid' of his bomb-making skills

Following his chilling threat to the UK, Muthana uploaded his images with the stark warning: 'Army base buildings before and after, I'm getting good with these bombs.'

They were accompanied by gruesome images of the badly burned remains of what Muthana said were dead Syrian government soldiers, although there is no indication the men had been inside the building at the time of the blast.

As well as posting the photographs, Muthana also said ISIS fighters would slaughter any Yazidi men they captured in northern Iraq and would enslave their women and children.

'Kuffar [non-believers] are afraid we 
will slaughter Yazidis, our deen [religious path] is clear we will kill 
their men, take their women and children as slaves insha Allah,' he posted on Twitter.

Jihadist: Nasser Muthana is a 20-year-old former Cardiff schoolboy who featured prominently in the Islamic State's first professionally produced English language propaganda video

Threat: Nasser Muthana posted a message on Twitter last month warning that the UK government should be afraid of him returning to the country with his new bomb making skills

The 
young jihadist, who describes himself on Twitter as a 'soldier of the 
Islamic State', said last month the UK government should be 'afraid' of 
his bomb-making skills.

He
 took a picture of a stack of improvised explosive devices stored inside a 
garage and uploaded them with the caption: 'So the UK is afraid I come back with the 
skills I've gained.'

Formerly a prospective medical student, he was joined in Syria by his younger brother Aseel, 17, who has now spoken of his willingness to die fighting for ISIS.

The Muthana brothers, who grew up in Cardiff after their father moved there from Yemen as a teenager, are among hundreds of young men from Britain who have flown to Syria to join the rebels.

Find: Muthana claims to have found this prayer mat inside the army base. He says it offers devotion to the Prophet Mohammed's daughter and is therefore in breach of Islamic law as evidence of practicing idolatry

Friends: Reyaad Khan (left), who is also from Cardiff, appeared alongside Muthana (right) in the ISIS propaganda video, urging other young Muslims in the West to join them in jihad

Their friend Reyaad Khan, 20, also from Cardiff, said he had 'fireworks' for the U.S. if they returned to fight in Iraq.

Nasser 
posted the warning of his bomb-making skills on his new Twitter page 
@abulmuthanna313 after deleting his previous profile last month.

He was reportedly unhappy with the high levels of attention it received following his appearance in ISIS' recruitment video.

Khan, who uses the Twitter handle @AbuDujanaRK, appeared alongside Muthana in the video, urging other young Muslims in the West to join them in jihad.

Reyaad Khan and Nasser Muthana are among the British jihadists fighting with ISIS in Iraq that are using social networking sites to lure young Muslim teenagers from the UK into joining the Islamic State fanatics.

The extremists, who boast of ‘slaughtering’ innocent Yazidis and ‘taking their women as slaves’, are advising 15-year-olds that they are ‘not too young’ to die fighting for Allah.

Asked by a British 18-year-old girl if she is too young to join, one of them replied: ‘I know sisters younger than you. I heard of maybe 16-year-olds being here from UK. You aren’t too young.’

They are informing their British ‘brothers and sisters’ every day how to make their way to Iraq, claiming they are ‘ordered’ to defy their parents and fight jihad.

The British IS fighters, who refer to themselves as the ‘Baadiya Boys’ after their original base in Syria, include Khan and Muthana.

The former Catholic college students have been joined on the frontline by young Muslim men and women from across the UK, including a group of five friends from Portsmouth, two of whom have already been killed.
