Prison officers were warned that Raoul Moat was a 'lunatic' and potential murderer shortly before he killed his ex-girlfriend's new lover, an inquest heard today.

A fellow inmate claimed that Moat was intent on 'some sort of revenge' against his ex Samantha Stobbart and her boyfriend, karate instructor Chris Brown.

The revelation came to light during an inquest into Mr Brown's death in July 2010.

Moat hunted down Ms Stobbart and Mr Brown, 29, and shot them in cold blood using a shotgun two days after he was released from HMP Durham.

Ms Stobbart survived the attack, while her ex-boyfriend went on the run and the next day shot and blinded PC David Rathband.

The inquest opened today at Newcastle Crown Court with the evidence of a man who was in prison with Moat and is known as N1 because he cannot be named for legal reasons.

He told the hearing that he said to a prison officer he believed Moat would end up killing someone after his release.

'It was sort of an off-the-cuff comment, but I believe I said, "He's a lunatic and will end up killing someone,"' he said.

N1 also told the court that Moat was unbalanced and would get angry when talking about Ms Stobbart and the police.

'He indicated that he was going to take some sort of revenge against her and her partner,' he said.

The court heard that Moat had made it clear that he would never return to prison, and that he had also boasted about having access to a shotgun and explosives.

It was also told the killer had indicated he intended to commit 'suicide by cop', which meant he would put himself in a position where he was shot by the police.

Evidence was given that in prison he had described the outside of his ex-partner's house in detail, and said a large green verge would make spying on her difficult.

N1 said Moat had told him that he would 'shoot to kill' five people - Ms Stobbart, her mother, her new partner, a psychiatrist and a social worker.

At the start of proceedings a statement was read out by Mr Brown's mother, Sally, which described the torment suffered by the family since his death.

'His friends said he was like Marmite - either you loved him or you hated him,' she said. 'But if you loved him you had a friend for life. He was very loyal, happy-go-lucky and never sat still.

'As soon as he tried karate he said he loved it and was good at it. He enjoyed teaching it and especially teaching children.'

She said in the days leading up to his death he had been in good spirits and they had spoken regularly on the phone.

'It has been horrendous for the whole family, I cannot think of anything worse than burying your own child,' she said. 'I can only think of one word to describe it - hell.'

Moat was hunted down by police and found in Rothbury, Northumberland, where he shot himself after a week on the run.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission and an internal prison inquiry have looked at details of Moat's release from Durham Prison.

PC Rathband was hailed a hero after his ordeal, but he was apparently unable to cope with the trauma of being blinded, and was found hanged at his home last year.
