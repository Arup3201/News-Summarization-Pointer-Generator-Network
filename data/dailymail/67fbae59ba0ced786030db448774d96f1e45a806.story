Wartime codebreaker Alan Turing is set to be pardoned posthumously for his criminal conviction for homosexuality.

The Government will not stand in the way of new legislation needed to pardon him and it could be passed within three months, it was confirmed yesterday.

While Gordon Brown gave a public apology for his cruel treatment in 2009, at the time ministers said it was not possible to overturn his 1952 conviction for gross indecency.

Pardon: Professor Stephen Hawking is among 11 signatories of a letter urging David Cameron to forgive Bletchley Park codebreaker Alan Turing's conviction for the then crime of homosexuality in 1952

Mr Turing, a brilliant mathematician, helped Britain win the Second World War through his work at Bletchley Park, where he invented the machine which cracked the Enigma codes used by German U-boats in the Atlantic.

But despite his crucial work – which some historians believe may have shortened the war by two years – Mr Turing was convicted of gross indecency for having a relationship with a 19-year-old. 

At that time homosexuality was illegal, and he chose to be chemically castrated with injections of female hormones rather than go to jail. He committed suicide two years later.

In the House of Lords yesterday, Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon, a whip, said the Government would not stand in the way of a Bill brought by Liberal Democrat peer Lord Sharkey, which offers him a full parliamentary pardon.

He said: ‘The Government know that Turing was a hero and a very great man. They acknowledge that he was cruelly treated. They must have seen the esteem in which he is held.

‘The Government therefore is very aware of the cause to pardon Turing given his outstanding achievement and therefore has great sympathy with the objective of the Bill.’ If there were no amendments, the bill could be passed in the House of Commons as early as October, he said.
