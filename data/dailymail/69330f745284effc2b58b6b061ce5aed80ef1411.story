Anthony Marsh earns £232,000 a year as head of the West Midlands and East of England ambulance services - £90,000 more than the Prime Minister

An ambulance service boss who earns more than the Prime Minister claimed £30,000 in 16 months for hotel and transport expenses, it has been revealed.

Anthony Marsh earns £232,000 a year as head of both the West Midlands and East of England ambulance services - £90,000 more than the Prime Minister.

He took up the joint role in January 2013 and works three days a week for the East of England service and two for the other. The move brought a £50,000 increase to his salary.

He came under fire from health minister Dan Poulter, the MP for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, earlier this month who said his salary package was 'unacceptably high' and sent a 'very bad message' to front-line staff.

According to records obtained by the BBC, Mr Marsh has stayed at 92 hotels in the last 16 months and claimed over £13,000 in expenses to cover his visits.

The amount includes 20 nights at the four-star Pullman St Pancras hotel in London which cost the taxpayer £4,514.

Since July 2013 he has also claimed more than £10,000 in taxi and car costs and over £6,000 on train fares.

The ambulance services claim that Dr Marsh's combined role saves £130,000 in public money and said he had no choice but to stay in hotels.

A spokesperson said: 'Like every ambulance service chief executive in England, Dr Marsh spends time in London meeting MPs, other stakeholders, officials from NHS England and working on national projects through the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives.

'As he is currently representing two ambulance services, this work is being delivered more effectively and efficiently for the taxpayer.

'Mr Marsh is currently running two ambulance trusts; he does not receive the salary of two chief executives saving the taxpayer approximately £130,000 on the cost of having a substantive chief executive in each ambulance trust.

'By comparison, within the same two areas, there are 11 chief fire officers and 10 chief constables.  It is ludicrous to suggest that the tax payer is getting poor value for money.

'As Mr Marsh works several days a week in the East of England each week, it would not make sense to have him travel down on a daily basis and therefore requires accommodation.

'This is governed by NHS Guidelines. The lowest cost is always sought for his overnight accommodation such as using standard government negotiated rates.

Health minister Dan Poulter, pictured, criticised Mr Marsh earlier this month who said his salary package was 'unacceptably high'

'Rather than spending upwards of seven hours a week driving himself, where he would be unable to work, Mr Marsh is often driven between the West Midlands and East of England.

'This allows him to continue working throughout the journey once again bringing value for the tax payer.  Mr Marsh has not made any subsistence claims. 

'However, he has spent or been entitled to allowances to the value of just under £3,000, none of which have been claimed. 'West Midlands Ambulance Service is exceeding its performance targets this year despite very challenging circumstances.'

The spokesperson added that his joint role has helped make £8million savings of back office functions and management savings which was funding 400 staff, 147 ambulances and over 60 rapid response vehicles.

Mr. Poulter's office yesterday said he was on holiday and would not be able to comment on the issue.

Dr Marsh was brought in to oversee EEAS after criticising its failings in a report. The service says Dr Marsh has put in plans so its targets are met.

The expenses figure was revealed in a Freedom of Information request submitted by the BBC.
