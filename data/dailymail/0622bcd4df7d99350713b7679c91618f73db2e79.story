The retiring Democratic Iowa Senator has urged voters not to support candidate Joni Ernst, saying 'I don't care if she's as good looking as Taylor Swift'.

Senator Tom Harkin said the Republican representative would not be right for Iowa despite the fact that she seems 'attractive' and 'sounds nice' on campaign adverts.

Ms Ernst is vying to become the first woman to represent Iowa in the Senate by defeating Democrat Bruce Braley in a contest which could decide which party controls the Senate.

The retiring Democratic Iowa Senator has urged voters not to support candidate Joni Ernst (right), saying 'I don't care if she's as good looking as Taylor Swift'

Speaking at a Democratic barbecue last week, Mr Harkin said: 'In this Senate race, I've been watching some of these ads.

'And there's sort of this sense that, 'Well, I hear so much about Joni Ernst. She is really attractive, and she sounds nice.'

'Well I got to thinking about that. I don't care if she's as good looking as Taylor Swift or as nice as Mr. Rogers, but if she votes like Michele Bachmann, she's wrong for the state of Iowa.'

The crowd burst into applause after his speech.

Harkin spent Sunday campaigning with Mr Braley, a day after a Des Moines Register poll showed the Democrat trailing Ernst by seven points in a race he was once expected to win handily.

The poll suggested that the Republicans may win a race deemed critical to the party's takeover of the U.S. Senate.

J. Ann Selzer, who conducted the poll, said 'This race looks like it's decided.'

More than 51 percent of likely voters support Ms Ernst, the poll found, the biggest lead the Iowa state senator and former military leader has received so far.

Ms Ernst has served a combined 21 years in the United States Army Reserves and the Iowa Army National Guard.

She spent 14 months mobilized and overseas in Kuwait from 2003-2004 as a company commander at the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

In her role as a Lieutenant Colonel, Ms Ernst currently commands the largest battalion in the Iowa Army National Guard.

Michele Bachmann is a congresswoman best known for her conservative Tea Party politics, and her candidacy for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination. 

American voters will decide which party controls the U.S. Senate in tomorrow's elections and at least 10 competitive races are still considered too close to predict a winner.

Around 36 of the 100 Senate seats are at stake in the midterm elections, which are held halfway through the four-year presidential term. 

Republicans must pick up six more seats from Democrats to reclaim a majority.

All 435 seats are up for election in the House of Representatives, where Republicans are expected to expand their majority, and governors will be chosen in 36 states.
