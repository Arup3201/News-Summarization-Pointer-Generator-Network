Victim: Joseph Griffiths was stabbed to death by a burglar

A 20-year-old has been arrested on suspicion of the murder of an elderly man, who is believed to have been attacked during a burglary at his home.

Joseph Griffiths, 73, was found dead at his home in Fulham, west London, on Saturday, after police were called to investigate a break-in.

The arrest was made as relatives of 
Mr Griffiths paid tribute to him, describing the 'great void' his death 
has left in their lives.

In
a statement released this morning, his family said: 'Joe was a husband,
father and grandfather, he was a successful businessman who embraced 
life and lived it to the full.

'He took great pride in 
his business and it gave him immense satisfaction that three generations
of the Griffiths family were employed there.

'Joe’s sudden and tragic demise has 
shocked and saddened all who knew and loved him, and has left a great 
void in all our lives. We will miss his forthright views and wicked 
sense of fun.

'Joe leaves behind a wife, two sons and seven grandchildren, who all 
completely adore and miss him. The support from our friends, our 
customers, old and new has been overwhelming, we greatly appreciate it.'

The man was arrested this morning and is currently in custody at a central London police station, Scotland Yard confirmed.

Officers were originally called at around 6.20am on Saturday to reports of a burglary at Hazlebury Road.

A man inside the address had suffered a violent attack, and was pronounced dead at the scene, police said. A post-mortem examination has confirmed he was stabbed.

There were other people in the house at the time but none was injured.

Tributes: Flowers have been left outside Mr Griffiths' home

Scotland Yard said officers are 
keeping an open mind on the motive for the attack, but one line of 
inquiry is that it appears Mr Griffiths disturbed an intruder.

Detective Chief Inspector Steven 
Lawrence said: 'We continue to appeal to anyone who may have witnessed 
anyone suspicious prior to or after this incident or anybody who has any
information which would assist us.

'We are conducting house-to-house inquiries in and around Mr Griffiths’ home and forensic examinations are also ongoing.'
