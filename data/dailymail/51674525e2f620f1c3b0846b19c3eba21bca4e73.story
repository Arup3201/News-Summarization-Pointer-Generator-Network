The heckler who interrupted the First Lady this week to protest about discrimination against gay and lesbian Americans said she felt compelled to speak after five years of inaction in the White House.

Ellen Sturtz, 56, says she feels let down by President Obama, after supporting his 2008 election campaign because of his promise to protect homosexuals from workplace discrimination.

She added that despite having an executive order waiting on his desk for him to sign, President Obama has yet to act on his promises to protect the community.

Campaign: Ellen Sturtz says she felt compelled to speak up about gay rights during Michelle Obama's speech

'I don’t have time to wait another 
generation for equality - it’s been almost 40 years since similar 
legislation to ENDA was first introduced in Congress. And being polite 
hasn’t gotten us any closer to it becoming a reality,' Miss Sturtz, who lives in Washington DC, said.

Her campaign came to national attention this week, after her outburst in front of 200 people at a $10,000 a head fundraiser at the home of Karen Dixon and Dr Nan Schaffer.

As Michelle Obama have a speech at the Washington DC event, Miss Sturtz interrupted her to complain that the President had not yet signed the executive order.

The order was designed to protect federal employees. The President had also made a campaign promise to pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), which was set to end workplace discrimination by all employers.

While many companies have addressed the issue, some major companies, such as Exxon Mobil, have set 'a dangerous precedent' Miss Sturtz claimed.

The incident, caught in mobile phone footage, shows the First Lady walk over to the gay rights campaigner, before saying: 'Listen to me or you can take the mic, but I’m leaving. You all decide. You have one choice.'

Miss Sturtz told the Washington Post: 'When I blurted out my comments during the First Lady’s speech, it was a spontaneous reaction to her saying, 
“Right now, today, we have an obligation to stand up for those kids".'

'I 
needed to speak up for LGBT youth, who make up 40 per cent of homeless 
youth - kicked out on to the street because parents and workplaces won’t 
accept them for who they are - and for LGBT parents, whose lack of 
workplace protections imperils their children’s futures,' the campaigner, who divorced her wife, Barbara Zacky, last year, said.

Critics have said Miss Sturtz was wrong to take her campaign to the First Lady because she is not an elected official.

However, Miss Sturtz says that only days after Senate Democrats refused to include same-sex couples in their immigration reform bill, Mrs Obama had asked the gay and lesbian community to contribute to the Democratic National Committee.

Initially Miss Sturtz, who says for years she felt forced to hide her sexuality from friends and colleagues, had planned to speak to Democratic National Committee officials at the fundraiser, the Examiner said.

But, as Mrs Obama began her speech about protecting future generations, Miss Sturtz felt compelled to speak.

'I 
could no longer remain silent while standing in front of one of our 
country’s most powerful political figures. I spoke up for the millions 
of LGBT Americans,' she said.

The retired government regulator added: 'Mrs Obama has accomplished extraordinary
things and is inarguably the conscience of the White House. She 
understands injustice at a deep level, and it was that political 
conscience I was hoping to stir at this week’s fundraiser.'

Miss Sturtz, who helped organize the first Gay Pride festival in San Luis Obispo, California, said: 'My hope is that the First Lady sees me as
just one of millions who are desperate to participate fully in the 
American dream - a dream she is helping to build for millions across 
this country.'
