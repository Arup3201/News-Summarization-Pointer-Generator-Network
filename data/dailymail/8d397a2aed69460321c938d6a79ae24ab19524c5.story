A US deep-sea exploration company says it has recovered about 48 tons of silver from a British cargo ship that was sunk by a torpedo during World War II.

The haul comes from the SS Gairsoppa, which was hit by a torpedo from a German U-boat about 300 miles off Ireland's coast in 1941. It now sits 15,420ft deep.

Salvage firm Odyssey Marine Exploration said it is the heaviest and deepest recovery of precious metals from a shipwreck ever made.

Doomed: On February 17, 1941, a single torpedo sank the SS Gairsoppa. All but one of her 85 crewmen were lost

Haul: Forty-eight tons of silver bullion has been recovered from the SS Gairsoppa and returned to the British Government but salvage firm Odyssey Marine Exploration Inc will keep 80% after expenses

The company is under contract with the 
British Government and will get to keep 80 per cent of the haul after 
expenses. The remaining 20 per cent will go to the Treasury

So far, workers have brought up more 
than 1,200 silver bars, or about 1.8 million troy ounces, worth about £23.7 million (about $37 million).

The company is under contract with the British Government and will get to keep 80 per cent of the haul after expenses. The remaining 20 per cent will go to the Treasury.

SS Gairsoppa was steaming home from 
India in 1941 while in the service of the Ministry of War Transport when
 she was torpedoed by a Nazi U-boat.

She sank in British waters about 300 miles off the south west coast of Ireland. Only one of her 84 crew members survived.

The 412-ft steamship has remained sitting upright on the seabed with its holds open, nearly three miles under water.

The ship, recognisable by the 
red-and-black paintwork of the British-India Steam Navigation Company 
and the torpedo hole in its side, was sailing in a convoy from Calcutta 
in 1941.

Buffeted by high winds and running 
low on coal, the captain decided he would not make it to Liverpool and 
broke from the convoy to head for Galway.

A single torpedo from U-101 sank her 
in 20 minutes, on February 17, 1941. Three lifeboats were launched, but 
only Second Officer Richard Ayres made it to land, reaching the Cornish 
coast after 13 days.

In an earlier statement Odyssey said the UK 
government was ‘desperately looking for new sources of income’ and was 
urging it to find more British wrecks.

It was also investigating HMS 
Sussex, lost off Gibraltar with 10 tons of gold in 1694, and HMS 
Victory, a precursor to Nelson’s flagship.

In 2008 a US judge ordered the firm
 to hand back gold and silver coins worth £300million to Spain, which 
said the treasure was taken from a frigate that sank in 1804.

Odyssey said the wreck’s identity was unclear and had been found in international waters.

Heroic: Second Officer Richard Ayres, the only survivor of the SS Gairsoppa

During World War II, Britain, cut off from occupied Europe, was utterly dependent on supplies reaching her by sea.

But Hitler was determined to force Britain to her knees by cutting off 
these supplies. He ordered his U-boat captains to hunt down and destroy 
Allied shipping.
In February 1941 alone, 38 British ships were sunk.

Many of the ships were old and heavily laden, so they could travel no 
faster than eight knots, making them an easy target for U-boats.

The Gairsoppa, with its heavy load of almost 7,000 tonnes which included
 the silver, as well as iron and tea, was forced to burn more and more 
fuel to maintain her speed in the stormy seas as they journeyed north.

Fearing that he did not have enough fuel to make it to Liverpool, her 
skipper, Captain Gerald Hyland, asked permission to break away from the 
convoy and make instead for Galway on Ireland’s south-west coast, and on
 February 14, 1941, the Gairsoppa left the convoy.

The U-101, captained by Ernst Mengersen, headed towards the Gairsoppa, 
hoping to make a ‘kill’, and at 2230 hours a massive explosion blew 
apart the ship’s Number Two hold. Such was the impact of the single 
torpedo that the foremast snapped and crashed to the deck, taking with 
it the radio antennae, so the crew were unable even to send a distress 
signal.

They were alone and sinking fast. As fire and smoke ripped through the 
Gairsoppa, Captain Hyland gave the order to abandon ship and the men 
made for the lifeboats.

Then bullets ripped through the darkness, forcing them to

throw themselves down.

The U-boat surfaced and sprayed the deck with machine-gun fire. Some of 
the bullets cut through the ropes of one lifeboat, sending it crashing 
into the sea. Dozens of men leapt overboard and swam towards it, 
including Second Officer Richard Ayres.

They began pushing away from the stricken vessel to avoid being sucked 
down as it sank, and had to paddle frantically to get clear of the 
spinning propellers.

Somehow they pulled away and watched as just a hundred yards from them, 
the Gairsoppa disappeared under the waves, within 20 minutes of being 
hit. Of the other two lifeboats there was no sign. They were alone in 
icy seas, hundreds of miles from land.

There were 31 men in the lifeboat: eight Europeans and 23 Indian seamen —
 known as Lascars — who immediately began suffering badly from the cold,
 so they were given all the blankets and some canvas for shelter.

The only man skilled at sailing a small boat, was 31-year-old Richard 
Ayres who immediately took command and set sail eastwards, steering with
 an oar because the rudder had been lost.

Their food supplies consisted of some tins of condensed milk and dry 
biscuit, so hard it could barely be swallowed. Ayres resisted the crew’s
 pleas for extra water rations to soften the biscuit, because they were 
desperately short of water.

Each man was limited to half a pint of water a day and half a pint a 
night. But the Lascars began drinking salt water, which made them go mad
 and fight each other.

Soon, men began dying. Then, on the eighth day, water ran out.

There was no sign of land and little chance of rescue: no one knew their fate or whereabouts.

Men become delirious and ‘had barely enough hope and heart to carry on,’
 according to Ayres. A couple of rain showers gave some relief from the 
thirst that burned their throats, but in the cold air, their hands and 
fingers became swollen with frostbite, making it impossible to grip the 
oars.

Over the next few days, their strength and spirit ebbed away.

But Ayres, determined, fit and strong, was resolved to save the lives of the remaining men.

He sailed the little boat through towering waves and fierce gales, 
snatching little sleep as only he, the Gairsoppa’s radio officer, 
18-year-old Robert Hampshire, and a gunner named Norman Thomas, 20, from
 Chatham, Kent, had the strength left to man the rudder.

Then, 13 days after the sinking, with only seven men surviving, many 
barely clinging to life, one man croaked out the word they all longed to
 hear: ‘Land’.

At first the others thought it was just a cloud, but then they made out a
 lighthouse. It was the Lizard lighthouse on the southernmost tip of 
Cornwall, 300 miles from where the Gairsoppa had sunk.

Ayres began sailing towards a rocky cove. Just as they were nearing its 
entrance, a huge wave smashed onto the small boat, capsizing it. In 
their weakened state, all but three of the men drowned — so near yet so 
far from safety.

Another wave righted the boat and Ayres managed to drag himself, 
Hampshire and Thomas on board, only for another breaker to capsize them 
again.

They clung to the keel, but as more waves crashed violently over them they lost their grip.

Hampshire was washed to his death, but Ayres and Thomas made it onto 
nearby rocks. Then another icy wave knocked Thomas backwards, drowning 
him just yards from safety.

Exhausted and alone, Ayres felt ‘the fight for life was not worthwhile’.
 Then, as he surrendered himself to his fate, he heard voices urging him
 not to give up.

Three young girls, Betty Driver, Olive Martin and her sister, evacuees 
from Tottenham in London, had been walking along the cliffs when they 
spotted the boat flip over in the stormy seas below.

One ran across the fields to fetch help from a nearby farm. The other 
two raced down to the beach and shouted to the men, begging them to keep
 swimming.

Eventually, the first girl returned with a coastguard named Brian Richards, who threw Ayres a rope and pulled him ashore.

The bodies of Hampshire, Thomas and two Lascars were recovered and 
buried in a nearby cemetery. It later transpired that the place where 
Ayres had come ashore, at Caerthillian Cove, was just a few miles from 
his home.

He was awarded an MBE in recognition of his heroic efforts to keep 
fellow survivors alive, as well as a War Medal for bravery at sea.

Ayres returned to sea just nine months later, and spoke little about it 
after the war, during his years in the Royal Naval Reserve.

He died in 1992. But the citation on his MBE will forever celebrate the 
extraordinary efforts of this brave man: ‘It was only the cruelty of the
 sea that robbed him of the fruits of his labour.
