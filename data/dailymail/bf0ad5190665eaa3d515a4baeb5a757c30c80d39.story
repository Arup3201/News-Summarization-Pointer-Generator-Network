'Caused unprecedented harm': Jake Birchall walked free from court today after his part in the cyber attacks dubbed Operation Payback

A man who hacked into PayPal and other major websites causing multi-million pound losses, has walked free from court today.

Jake Birchall was just 16-years-old when he was part of a computer gang called 
Anonymous that launched a series of devastating cyber attacks dubbed 
Operation Payback that ‘caused  unprecedented harm’ to Visa, MasterCard 
and the online payment firm PayPal.

Birchall, who used the nickname FenniC, ran computer servers for the gang for three months while attacks took place in 2010.

They ran a sophisticated and orchestrated campaign of online attacks that paralysed computer systems.

The
gang brought down PayPal for ten days causing losses totalling £3.5 
million by flooding the website with messages and requests.

Birchall,
of Chester, Cheshire was sentenced to 60 hours unpaid work and made the
subject of an 18 month youth rehabilitation order and 18 month 
supervision order.

Last 
month fellow hackers Christopher Weatherhead, 22, and Ashley Rhodes, 28,
who used the online names ‘Nerdo’ and ‘NikonElite’ were jailed for 
their part in the attacks.

Judge Testar said of Birchall today: 
‘Young as he was and with the disadvantages in life that he has and had 
he did actually play an important role.

‘He did play a prominent and 
important part in this and I think he’s got to learn to get out of bed 
in the morning and go and do unpaid work.

‘Many
would say that because you played a prominent role in this conspiracy 
which caused damage, nobody really knows quite how much damage it 
caused, and which potentially could have caused a lot more damage you 
ought to be serving a custodial sentence and a substantial one at that.

'Hactivists': Christopher Weatherhead (left), 22, of Northampton, was given an 18-month sentence and Ashley Rhodes (right), 28, of Camberwell, south London, was jailed for seven months at Southwark Crown Court

Avoided jail: Co-defendant Peter Gibson, 24, of Hartlepool, Durham, was deemed to have played a lesser role in the conspiracy, which he also admitted, and given a six-month suspended sentence

Jailed: 'Hactivist' Ashley Rhodes (pictured on his wedding day to wife Shirley) was nicknamed 'NikonElite'

‘But
I have to sentence you on the basis that you were under 18 when 
convicted and therefore I’ve to sentence you as a young person.’

In
jailing Weatherhead and Rhodes, Judge Testar said: ‘It is intolerable 
that when an individual or group disagrees with some particular entity’s
activity they should be free to curtail that activity by way of attacks
such as those that occurred in this case.’

Anonymous
originally targeted music industry bodies in retaliation for their 
anti-piracy stance, but evolved after the backlash against the leak of 
classified data by Julian Assange’s WikiLeaks.

PayPal
was attacked for refusing to process payments on behalf of the Wau 
Holland Foundation, an organisation involved in raising funds for 
WikiLeaks.

Targeted sites 
displayed the message ‘You’ve tried to bite the Anonymous hand. You 
angered the hive and now you are being stung’.

Anonymous launched Operation Payback when they learnt that Pirate Bay, a pirate music site, was facing legal proceedings.

Big loss: PayPal was attacked for refusing to process payments on behalf of the Wau Holland Foundation, an organisation involved in raising funds for WikiLeaks. It cost the money transfer website £3.5million

Hacked: The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (left) was forced to spend £20,000 as a result of being attacked and the British Recorded Music Industry (right) was also attacked

Believing
music should be available for free on the internet, the hackers 
targeted the websites run by music industry regulators. They also 
discussed breaking into pop star Lily Allen’s website.

Northampton
University graduate Weatherhead was convicted by a jury of conspiracy 
to impair the operation of computers last year. Rhodes, Gibson and 
Birchall all pleaded guilty to the offence.Birchall was said to enjoy a ‘high level of control’ over attacks and operated two servers used by the hackers.

He boasted he was the ‘second most anon’ after Weatherhead.

When
police went to arrest him he posted on an internet chat room used by 
Anonymous: ‘F***, the cops. I’m shutting everything down.’

Gibson, a University of York graduate, was described as a ‘technical specialist’.

Mr
Smith said: ‘[He was] involved in the running of servers, it was his 
understanding and expertise which assisted in maintaining servers from 
which attacks could be launched.’

He
said it was Gibson who suggested the attack on Lily Allen but had 
second thoughts when he had ‘concerns about attacking artists’.

Rhodes was heard to have had a ‘hands on’ approach in attacks and was regularly caught chatting online about targets.

Star: At one point Gibson suggested the website of singer Lily Allen, now known by her married name Lily Cooper, as a possible target to Rhodes, who agreed with the idea. But the attack never went ahead

The
court heard Rhodes even used his work computer to launch attacks and 
was involved in ‘doxing,’ a form of online research or spying to gather 
information on possible targets.

Between August 2010 and January 11 the gang targeted several websites.

The
British Recorded Music Industry (BPI) was attacked between September 19
and 20, 2010, though the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) did not 
shut the site down.

Four websites operated by Ministry of Sound were attacked between October 3 and 6.

The
International Federation of the Phonographic Industry was forced to 
spend £20,000 as a result of being attacked between November 27 and 
December 6.

Weatherhead, of
Northampton, was convicted of conspiracy to impair the operation of 
computers between August 1, 2010 and January 27 last year.

Rhodes, of Camberwell, south London, Gibson, of Hartlepool, Durham, and Birchall admitted the same charge.

Peter
Gibson, 24, who left Anonymous before the attack on PayPal took place, 
was sentenced to six months behind bars suspended for two years and 
ordered to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work.

Hearing: A trial at Southwark Crown Court (pictured) in central London heard that PayPal was attacked repeatedly after it decided not to process payments on behalf of a group involved in raising funds for WikiLeaks
