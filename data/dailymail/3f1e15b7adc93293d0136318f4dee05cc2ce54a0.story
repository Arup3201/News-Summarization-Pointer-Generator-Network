They may look like perfectly crafted sculptures or delicately etched pictures - but a father-daughter team say these images took far less effort.

Photographer Nelson Jones and his daughter Hillary told MyFoxDC that the pair created the pictures by pressing their faces in the snow and then taking snaps of the indents.

Speaking with Fox, Jones explained that the pair had been shoveling snow outside their Washington D.C. home on Friday morning and commented on how fresh it looked.

Ice work: Nelson Jones and his daughter Hillary pushed their faces into the snow outside their D.C. home and snapped a picture of it. When they looked at the photo they were shocked to see it looked 3D

His daughter suggested that they stick their faces in the snow on the roof of the car, so they gave it ago, 'and so the crazy, 3D snow face plant pic was born!', Fox reported.

Jones said that the resulting image on his daughter's iPhone surprised them as the dents did not look 3D to the naked eye.

While Fox insisted that the images were real, others expressed their skepticism at the level of detail.

'I take extreme issue with the very fine detail of Jones' face, one wrote on Facebook. 'You realize how clay like the snow would have to be, how firm yet soft? How much pressure would need to be applied and depth to get into the lines?'

Bizarre: They said that the 3D faces weren't visible until they took photos of the snow, using a flash

He also asked why there were no 
indents from items such as hats or coats. But Fox insisted the images 
were created with nothing but their faces, adding of Jones: 'He was as 
suprised as we are!'

The 
images come after the area was blanketed with snow throughout Thursday 
night, with residents seeing anything between two and four inches.

They
 also suffered bitterly cold temperatures, with the mercury plummeting 
to its lowest level so far this season of 16 degrees. Forecasters said 
it felt more like -1 degree due to the wind.

Snow
 hit other areas across the Northeast even harder; there were between 
six and 10 inches reported around New York City, nine inches in 
Philadelphia and nearly 14 inches in Boston.

Snow storm: Other areas of the country, including Atlantic City, New Jersey (pictured) were harder hit by the snow storm. Parts of Boston could see as many as 14 inches, forecasters warned
