Hunter: Police believe Alois Huber, 55, is behind the attacks which have left four people dead

Police hunting a suspected poacher who shot dead three policemen and a paramedic in Austria have found a charred body inside the farmhouse where he was hiding, it emerged this morning.

Alois Huber, 55, allegedly went on a killing spree on Tuesday before barricading himself inside a property near Melk, about 40 miles west of Vienna.

Armed police commandos and army tanks surrounded the farmhouse before SWAT teams stormed the house and found the charred body, which they believe to be the gunman, after pushing through a wall into a smoke-filled hidden basement on the farm grounds.

Regional police spokesman Roland Scherscher told reporters SWAT teams discovered the body after extinguishing a fire in the small cellar that was accessible only through a hidden door.

He said the corpse was so badly burned that it was impossible to identify it but police assumed it was that of the gunman, who had been holed up on the farm grounds more than 24 hours before the charred remains were found.

Police 'had to push against the wall to enter the room,' he said. And because 'the perpetrator could have been hiding behind each corner,' the search took more than four hours as police cautiously combed through the two story building, said Schercher.

Police said final identification and cause of death would have to wait until forensic experts had finished their work. They said the assumption was that the suspect had laid the fire.

The gunman had killed three police officers and a paramedic early on Tuesday morning before barricading himself in a farm building near Melk.

During the 12-hour standoff, he shot sporadically at heavily armed police.

The Krone tabloid quoted a friend of 
the suspect as saying he had confessed in a telephone call from his home
as a police helicopter circled overhead and officers closed in.Â 

'Unfortunately
it is true. I shot three policemen tonight,' the paper quoted the 
conversation as related by the friend. 'I am the Annaberg poacher. They 
shot me too, in the stomach. But it doesn't matter.

'I shot Burgi (his German shepherd dog) and they are not going to get me either.'

The newspaper quoted the friend as saying the suspected gunman had confided two weeks ago that he was schizophrenic.

Police said he fired the last shot about an hour before helmeted officers wearing body armor and toting assault rifles piled into three Austrian army tanks and moved in. More than 100 police officers cordoned off the area.

The killings began about 24 hours before the suspect barricaded himself, after police stopped the man on a road near a wilderness area west of Vienna where there has been frequent poaching.

The gunman fled in his car, which landed in a ditch near the central Austrian town of Annaberg, then shot and wounded a member of Austria's Cobra SWAT team at a police checkpoint, said Interior Ministry spokesman Karl-Heinz Grundboeck. The police officer later died.

An ambulance raced to the scene, but the gunman shot and killed its driver as he tried to give first aid to the wounded policeman. The gunman also shot and wounded another officer at the scene. Grundboeck said he was expected to recover.

The attacker then fatally shot another police officer at a roadblock before barricading himself in the farm building.

Later on Tuesday, another officer who had been missing was found shot dead in his patrol car near the farm, said Grundboeck. Scherscher said that officer was apparently killed after the suspect carjacked the police vehicle and took him hostage.

Scherscher said he could not confirm an Austrian media report that the suspect was shot in the abdomen by police before he sought refuge inside the farm building.

The provincial government of Lower Austria ordered black flags flown from all public buildings in honor of the victims.

Violent
crime is rare in Austria, but hunting is a centuries-old tradition in 
the Alpine republic enjoyed by tens of thousands, many of them farmers 
and landowners.

The attacks happened after officers tried to stop the man following reports he had been hunting illegally
