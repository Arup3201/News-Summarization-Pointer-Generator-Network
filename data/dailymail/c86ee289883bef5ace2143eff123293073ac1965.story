An Indiana man with 47 guns and stocks of ammunition was arrested after threatening to go into a local elementary school and 'kill as many people as he could before police could stop him'.

Von Meyer, 60, was arrested on Friday after his wife called Cedar Lake police after he threatened to set her on fire and continue his violent spree by attacking a nearby elementary school.

The loaded threat came the same day that a young man killed 20 children and seven others in Newtown, Connecticut.

When police arrived at Meyer's home, they found 47 guns and ammunition, the sum of which cost more than $100,000.

'Through investigation, police learned that Meyer reportedly had a large number of weapons hidden throughout the two story historical home,' the report states.

The makes and models of the guns have not been released, but many of them were said to be historical collectors items.

Meyer allegedly said that he was going to light his wife on fire once she fell asleep. His plan didn't end there, however, as he set his sights on the Jane Ball Elementary School which is less than 1,000 feet away from his home.

The police report states that the school is easily accessed from Meyer's home by a series of trails and paths that cut through a wooded area.

Officials at Jane Ball School were notified, and they immediately took unspecified security measures.

Dangerously close: Meyer's house is extremely close to an elementary school, making his comments more threatening

The same happened at all local schools on Friday because of the threat, which was undoubtedly heightened as news rolled in of the shooting in Connecticut.

Police arrested Meyer and he now faces four counts of felony intimidation, two counts of resisting law enforcement, and one count of domestic battery.

Meyer was known to be a member of the Invaders Motorcycle Gang, though his role in the group was unclear.

Like the notorious Hells Angels, the Invaders Motorcycle Gang is also considered an outlaw group. The Northern Indiana chapter was founded in 1965.

He is being held without bail at the Lake County jail.Â
