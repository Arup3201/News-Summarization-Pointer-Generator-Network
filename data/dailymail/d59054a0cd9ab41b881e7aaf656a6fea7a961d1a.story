It's home to some of the world's best musical talent so it's hardly surprising that the Royal Albert Hall has called on a roster of esteemed musicians for its Christmas video.

The new festive footage, which aims to celebrate the London venue's achievements within music education, features an eclectic mix of stars.

Coldplay have lent their support to the video by allowing their hit Christmas Lights to be recreated by Vocalize, an urban choir from Sedgehill School in Lewisham.

The school is clearly a hotbed of talent. Former Sedgehill students include Amy Kabba (A*M*E), whose collaboration with Duke Dumont, Need U, topped the charts and was nominated for a Grammy Award.

Another pupil, Taneisha Jackson, has been signed to Universal Records, with global superstar John Legend recording one of her songs, A Place Called World. 

The video opens with Trey Qua, 18, who has competed in the UK Beatboxing Championships and is currently working on a solo album in his spare time.

Basia Bozzao, 19, also stars and has sung in the Primary Proms and is currently pursuing a career in the music industry as a singer songwriter.

Remember me? Singer-songwriter Jake Bugg, 20, who is famed for his relationship with model Cara Delevingne, is one of the video's biggest stars

Singer-songwriter Jake Bugg, 20, who is famed for his relationship with model Cara Delevingne, is one of the video's biggest stars. He also took part in the organisation's music workshops.

During the week of the Brit Awards in February 2014, Jake Bugg spent two days at the Royal Albert Hall working with 10 young vocalists. The students at the workshops worked directly with Jake as well as professional singer and vocal coach Patsy McKay, exploring, learning and rehearsing his song Broken.

Jake, who is a member of the Burberry family, also offered the students the chance to join him on the Hall’s main stage at his Albert Session concert after the workshop on Friday 21 February.

Classical trumpet musician and winner of three Classic BRIT awards, Alison Balsom, also stars, as do the World’s Largest Samba Band, the Teenage Cancer Trust and primary schools and care home residents.

Vicky Adeosun, 15, from Vocalize, said: 'Working with the Royal Albert Hall has been really inspirational. We not only performed in the video but got to record the song in a professional studio, and appear at the Music for Youth Schools Prom. 

'Just seeing the reaction of the audience was really great. Working with the Royal Albert Hall has given me a real insight into working in the music industry.'

A spokesperson for the venue said: 'The Royal Albert Hall is dedicated to providing opportunities within music education for young people across the country, through our unique programme of education and outreach. 

'This year’s Christmas video celebrates the success of these initiatives by showcasing the talent that we have helped to unlock, and the amazing diversity of people we have inspired through our programme.'

The education programme offers fledgling stars the opportunity to learn from and be inspired by the finest music artists on the scene, taking part in workshops hosted by the likes of Emeli Sandé, Foals and Nicola Benedetti.

Lucille Jousselin, 17, from Vocalize, reflected on her own experiences at the Hall, saying: 'When we were doing the Emeli Sandé workshop, it wasn’t just a bunch of students working together; it was a group working with a professional musician. It has allowed me to be dedicated to something I am passionate about.'
