Ed Miliband might have hoped for a better day of PR after two disastrous interviews yesterday left him looking clueless.

But as the Labour leader embarked on a nationwide tour to woo voters for tomorrow's elections, his very first photo opportunity at 6.30am ended in disaster.

He smiled for the cameras after buying a bacon sandwich at New Covent Garden Market, only for the cafe owner to later admit that he is backing the Tories because they are more pro-business.

Mr Miliband hopes to use a series visits across the country to connect with voters ahead of local and European elections tomorrow

Being seen to eat a bacon sandwich at New Covent Garden Market probably seemed like a good idea, but the pictures tell a different story

After settling down at a nearby table, Mr Miliband did not look like he was enjoying his toasted buttie.

A number of photographs showed the Labour leader pulling a series of contorted faces. 

His struggle to appear in touch with ordinary people suffered a fresh setback after it emerged he regularly spends £2.25 on an artisan loaf of bread from a deli near his North London home.

Mr Miliband hopes to draw a line under interest in his own spending with a new focus on Labour policies ahead of local and European Parliament elections tomorrow.

Polls suggest Ukip will win the European Parliament elections, pushing Labour into second place and the Tories in third.

Local elections are also being held in England, with 4,216 seats and 161 councils at stake.

He embarked on a 10 visits - taking him from London to his Doncaster constituency via towns in the South East, East of England, East Midlands and Yorkshire & Humberside.

It began with an early morning visit to New Covent Garden Market, where he bought a bunch of red roses for wife Justine and chatted with traders.

Mr Miliband then posed for the cameras as he bought a bacon sandwich from cafe owner Antonios Foufas.

But the visit did nothing to win over the local businessman. 'I find the Conservatives are more pro-business,' Mr Foufas told the Standard.

In a blow to the Labour leader, Mr Foufas later revealed that he is backing the Conservatives

It was an inauspicious start to the day after suffering not one but two PR blunders yesterday. 

He was accused of being 'out of touch with reality' after claiming to spend just £70 or £80-a-week on shopping bills, when the average for a family of four is well over £100. 

He suffered further humiliation in a subsequent radio interview because he did not know the name of the Labour party leader at a battleground council.

His blunders were seized on by the Tories, who accused him of being a ‘champagne socialist’.

The interviews made for a day of woe 
for Mr Miliband as voters prepare to go to the polls tomorrow for 
European and local council elections.

The trip to the market at 6.30am was the first stop on a tour of 10 areas designed to highlight Labour policies

Mr Miliband has been under pressure after two polls last week put the Tories ahead for the first time in two years.

He has been under pressure after two polls last week put the Tories ahead for the first time in two years. 

The Labour leader said: 'If I have heard one message most of all in this campaign, it is the depths of discontent about the way the country is run.

'The challenges go beyond this Government. And people are asking whether any political party can turn it round?

'Can anyone rebuild the link between a hard day's work and ordinary family finances?

'That link that used to be the foundation of our country's prosperity. That used to guarantee the people of this country a decent life for them and their families.

'My answer is that Labour can and Labour will. People should vote Labour on Thursday to make Britain better than this. Vote Labour to make your family better off.'
