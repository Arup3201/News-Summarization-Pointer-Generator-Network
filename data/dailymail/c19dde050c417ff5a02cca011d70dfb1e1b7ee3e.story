The Queen's composer has attacked the state of music teaching in Britain, branding it 'disgraceful' that so many young people do not know who Mozart is.

Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, Master of the Queen's Music, said it 
was both 'a disgrace' and 'a shock' that so many youngsters had now 
never even heard of Mozart or Beethoven - let alone listened to their 
music.

He blamed successive governments for treating classical music as 'an elitist fringe activity.'

The 79-year-old musician, rated as the world's greatest living composer, says it's shocking that youngsters do not know Mozart

It now means that both he and acclaimed 
violinist Nicola Benedetti in have warned about the dangers of a 
generation growing up ignorant of the world's greatest works.

He said he backed 'to the hilt' Ms Benedetti in calling for every young person to be 'made' to study classical works to help them understand humanity.

The Orkney-based 79-year-old musician, rated as the world's greatest living composer, said Ms Benedetti, who recently worked with about 200 young musicians at the Royal Albert Hall, had done 'a great service' in highlighting the issue.

Benedetti said it was ridiculous that classical music was marginalised in schools because of the perception that children do not find it 'fun'

'I think she is a great ambassador and role model and absolutely right,' said Sir Peter, who recently was given the all clear after a cancer battle.

'I step down as Master of the Queen's Music in March but I plan to concentrate my time on helping to make classical music more accessible to young people. We are in grave danger of losing - through not learning or experiencing - centuries of a wealth of wisdom and works.

'There are hundreds of thousands of youngsters who now have never even heard of Mozart or Beethoven. It is shocking and a disgrace that has been allowed to happen.

'The same applies to Shakespeare and Dickens. It just shows what has gone wrong with areas of the educational system.

'I don't think the problem is limited to 'right or left' governments and councils. I'm afraid successive governments and local authorities have seen classical music as an elitist fringe activity.

'But it has been shown time and again that learning to play a classical instrument - or sing - makes you much cleaver, more confident and a better team player, as well as many other benefits.

'In this day and age when every bit of information is accessible through the internet to anybody who has a computer, the role of the creative arts has never been more important.

'If the same information is available to everyone, the challenge is who can use it the most creatively? That's why classical music is probably more relevant in today's society than it is has ever been - it hone's people's creativity, not just as musicians.

'Playing a musical instrument promotes a child's self-esteem by improving several key skills and habits - and I think all children should be made to study classical works. We are at a serious tipping point. We are in danger of centuries of learning being lost to the dubious influences of vacuous celebrity culture and inane talent shows.'

Teachers 'should be encouraged to take children through symphonies and explain the form in detail', the musicians claim

'If there is one thing I believe passionately about it is that children should have free access to learning an instrument.

'I am furious that some councils think it is perfectly acceptable to charge for instrument tuition. It is not - they are shameless and are unnecessarily limiting the life chances of those who can least afford it.

Many young people don't even recognise the works of some of the world's greatest composers such as Mozart (pictured) and Beethoven

'It goes against the very ethos of widening music across all social classes. The danger is that music becomes the preserve of the better off - the parents who can afford to pay - while talented children from poorer families miss out.'

Recently West Kilbride-born Ms Benedetti said 'there should be a substantial amount of complex great music in schools. It's insane to me that there isn't.'

She said teachers should be encouraged to take children through symphonies from Beethoven and Sibelius to Dvorak and Mahler and explain the form in detail.

'Every single young person in this country should be made - within the context of their school curriculum - to listen to the greatest classical works,' she said.

The 26-year-old musician, who last month won the best female artist at the Classic Brits, said it was ridiculous that classical music was marginalised in schools because of the perception that children do not find it 'fun.'

'Since when did everything have to be fun? Music can be fun and enjoyable, but it also provides a way to go as deep as you can into our history and our understanding of humanity; of our expression and growth as people,' she said.

'It makes me sad, the gross misunderstanding of its potential and power and influences.'

In the New Year Honours, Ms Benedetti was as a appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire for services to music and charity.
