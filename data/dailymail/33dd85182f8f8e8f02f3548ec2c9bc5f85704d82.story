Anthony Joshua has still not been taken as far as the third round in what is now six fights since Britain’s gold medallist at the London Olympics turned professional.

In the curtain-raiser to the mega-show at Wembley Stadium Big Josh took only one minute and 23 seconds of the first round to knock out his latest opponent.

Matt Legg, to the credit of the barely-known man from Milton Keynes, came out swinging and did manage to land one meaty left hook to the chin of Britain’s giant heavyweight hope before being  battered to the canvas.

Record: Anthony Joshua made it six wins in six in his professional career, all have been in two rounds or less

Winner: Joshua had promised to start the Froch-Groves rematch off with a bang and did so

Yet again: Joshua is told to go to his corner with Legg on the deck

Winner: Joshua salutes the crowd after just his sixth professional fight

As
 soon as Joshua unleased his combinations Legg was in trouble and a 
powerful right uppercut was so concussive that it hardly needed the 
glancing left hook which accelerated his descent.

It
 is high time for Joshua to face more testing opposition and plans are 
afoot for him  to meet Matt Skelton, the veteran European champion and 
world title challenger in Liverpool on July 12.

Unleashing: Joshua lands a savage combination in the first round to send Legg packing

Brutal: Legg goes down under Joshua's early barrage

On top: Joshua shows why he is an Olympic gold medallist and starts early

Brief
 though this appearance was, Joshua loved 92 seconds of it and said: 
‘What a fantastic experience to fight in this stadium on a night like 
this. It's a small ring and I knew I could land on him.'

Promoter Eddie Hearn revealed former world title challenger Matt Skelton could be Joshua's next opponent.
