Andy Cohen may be on the up with the release of his latest book - but he took a short trip down last night, riding on a fireman's pole.

The TV personality, 46, is seen taking the plunge inside the restored firehouse home of fellow host Anderson Cooper, where he partied alongside guests including Monica Lewinsky.

Clutching the pole as onlookers wish him well, Cohen flashes a big smile before letting himself slide down to the floor below.

Ready to slide: TV personality Andy Cohen flashed a smile before dropping down the fireman's pole at Anderson Cooper's house as Padma Lakshmi recorded

He ended up on the floor below, giving a glimpse at how fun life must be in the Cooper house

After Andy went, Padma hitched up her dress and gave it a go, landing in Anderson's open arms

After he lands, the suited guest can be heard shouting back up 'You've got to do it! It's so easy!'.

Moments after Cohen went Lakshmi hitched up her dress and gave it a go, sliding down to the open arms of Anderson, who had by then changed into a casual gray t-shirt.

The clip is a rare insight into Cooper's converted home in Greenwich Village, New York City. He bought the firehouse in 2010 for $4.3million and gut renovated it, making into his personal home.

Footage uploaded to Instagram by Top Chef host Padma Lakshmi shows that Cooper's home - which still reads 'Fire Patrol' on the front - has retained much of its original character.

Other guests cheerleading for Cohen's new book - the Andy Cohen Diaries - included Real Housewife NeNe Leakes and Lewinsky, who thrust herself back into the limelight last month by speaking about her affair with President Clinton.

There were also a host of Cohen's other boldfaced name friend, including Ellen Barkin, Victor Garber, Ali Wentworth, Jessica Seinfeld, Sandra Bernhard, Mark Consuelos and Kelly Ripa. 

Mark appeared to be one of the few husbands who came, as Jerry Seinfeld and Ali's husband George Stephanopolous were missing from photos.

Also filming the trip down the pole with her smartphone was fellow party guest Kelly Ripa

How meta! The moment the trio posed for the selfie was also captured on camera

Lewinsky posed with Leakes and Cohen in another Instagram snap from Cohen's account, which he termed 'the selfie to end all selfies'. 

Cohen's new tome, subtitled A Deep Look at a Shallow Year, is awash with celebrity gossip and behind-the-scenes tidbits from the last 12 months of his life on air.

The new release is set to have a particular focus on the New Housewives stars, with whom is said to have become 'codependent' - and includes details of how he persuaded Bethenny Frankel to return to the New York City edition of the show.

Padma put down her phone to also pose for a photo with the honoree and his good friends Mark Consuelos and wife Kelly Ripa

Everyone loved posing with the pole: Lewinsky, Jessica Seinfeld, Ripa,  Cohen, Alexandra Wentworth and comic Sandra Bernhard couldn't resist another photo opportunity by the house's fun feature

Smiles! Jessica Seinfeld posed up with the host and honoree - but it seemed her husband Jerry missed the party. Also Thursday Jerry told NBC News that he is uncomfortable with some social interactions and may be on the autism spectrum

Cooper, who hosted the bash, joked that the book was so scandal-ridden it made him want to sue Cohen.

In a snippet for the book jacket, Cooper said: [Cohen] 'has more genuinely funny and surprising encounters with celebrities and sublebrities in a day than I do all year.

'Then my name popped up. Now I just want to sue him.' 

Tequila fresca? No word if Cohen was drinking his show's signature drink at the bash, which was also attended by actor Vincent Garber, left

The book is so great even this monkey, an unexplained party guest, couldn't resist

The monkey was almost as popular to pose with as the fire pole

Actress Ellen Barkin, left, was also at the party. And did we mention the fireman's pole?
