Kell Brook reduced the mandatory challenger for his world title from Jo Jo Dan to Yo Yo Dan in four murderous rounds and then threatened to bounce Amir Khan on and off the canvas ‘as soon as he gets in here with me.’

Brook sent Dan crashing to the brink of oblivion four times and after referee Earl Brown administered a mandatory count eight for the last flattening a split second before the bell ended the fourth stanza of pain, everyone had seen enough.

The US official and the now desperate Dan’s corner men agreed to call a merciful halt.

Kell Brook celebrates stunning return to the ring with his partner Lindsey on Saturday night

Brook retained IBF welterweight world title by beating Jo Jo Dan in Sheffield

This was all Brook could have hoped for after having his left thigh slashed to the bone by a machete wielding hooligan barely six months ago.

Having feared either dying or being crippled, he came back fitter and stronger, just like the Six Million Dollar Man of old.

There was not a trace of anxiety, a flicker of hesitation or an inkling inconvenience as smashed Dan to pieces. 

Kell Brook returned from an horrific knife attack to win his first IBF welterweight world title defence in style

Kelll Brook floored Romanian challenger Jo Jo Dan four times in four rounds on Saturday night

                    Brook    Dan

Round 1:     10           9 

Round 2:     10           7

Round 3:     10           9 

Round 4:     10           7 

TOTAL        40          32 

This was an exceptional performance by Special K and the Motorpoint Arena rose to anoint Brook as Sheffield’s rightful heir to the throne of Prince Naseem Hamed.

The faithful joined him in calling out Khan for what Brook envisages as ‘the biggest fight out there for both of us.’

‘Who do you want to see me beat next,’ he roared. ‘Khan, Khan, Khan’ came the deafening, blood-thirsty response.

Six Million Dollars may be an underestimate for what they both could earn now from a stadium fight in late summer.

Brook, already the IBF world champion stamped his credentials as a serious player in the welterweight division and will go to Las Vegas next month pressing his case for fighting the winner of Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao. 

But the Khan fight later this year is a more realistic option.

Not that Khan would provide such a willing target as the Canadian-based Romanian who went through a world of pain.

Brook was defending his IBF world title belt for the first time since beating Shawn Porter in LA last summer 

Brook's range-finding left set up a hurtful right and then Dan was put down by a sharp uppercut 

Not only did Brook win every round but he inflicted deadly punishment with a right hand which could not miss.

The Motorpoint Arena was packed to the tank-full, waiting to welcome the fighter Sheffield believes can be its successor to Naseem Hamed.

That atmosphere generator had to be restarted after the electric shock of seeing another son of the Steel City, Adam Etches, brutally knocked out by his veteran Belarus rival for the IBF international middleweight belt.

The deeply experienced 40-year-old Sergei Khomitsky drew Etches into a clever trap midway through the third round, opening him up for the perfect right cross.

Canada-based southpaw Dan had entered the ring a heavy underdog with a record of 34-3 with 18 early wins

Etches went down like an axed tree, crashing his head against the canvas as he landed, and there were no protests as referee Howard Foster instantly waves his arms over the prone body and summoned medical assistance.

Video-screening of Brook’s triumphs in the ring and his leg-slashed tribulations outside the ropes restored he mood of optimism.

Special K came in to a thunder of expectation and to be greeted by famed Ready to Rumble announcer Michael Buffer. 

Dan had pronounced himself ready not only to rumble but to ignore the sound and fury of the partisan Sheffield crowd. 

Brook showed maturity to be patient, with 10,000 baying fans on their feet in his home town

Brook was dominant from the first bell and was ahead on the scorecards when the fight was stopped

He started brightly enough to suggest nerves might not be problem but he promptly pressed forward, playing into Brook’s preference for counter punching.

The home boy’s straight lefts over the Canadian based Romanian’s southpaw leads were especially effective and he was off to a good start. 

There were no signs of distress from that left leg which had been savagely severed. This time it was Brook inflicting the pain.

One sharp sent Dan reeling. The next, an uppercut, put him down. The third sent him to the canvas again.

Only a mix of gallantry and clinching got Dan through more punishment to the bell, which seemed more likely to have condemned him to a continuing world of pain rather than to have saved him.

Special K stamped his credentials as a serious player in the welterweight division

Brook was looking for the finish but Dan managed to weather the storm at the opening of the round – and somehow fought back. The Brook attack was relentless and Dan reeled around the ring like a drunk, yet still made it to the end of another three minutes of hell.

Brook's red shorts covered that wound on his left leg but there was no hiding place for his challenger.

Dan was taking right hands to the head as if by habit and he went down for the third time from an accumulation of blows. Make that a fourth, Dan falling a split second before the bell.

American referee Earl Brown completed the statutory eight count before agreeing with the challenger's corner that enough was enough.
