The US Marshals Service is to auction $20 million worth of bitcoins seized during the prosecution of the alleged owner of black-market drugs website Silk Road.

The bitcoins were found on a computer authorities claim belonged to Ross Ulbricht who is accused of creating the website where drugs and other illegal items could be purchased. They were then seized under civil forfeiture laws. 

On Friday the coins were valued at $395.49 each by digital currency news website CoinDesk. 

The website, said to be the biggest online marketplace for drugs in the world, was taken down by the FBI in October  2013 when police arrested Ulbricht.

The website gained worldwide notoriety in 2011 as a black market bazaar where visitors could buy and sell drugs using bitcoins, a form of online cash, almost completely anonymously. An online tool known as a Tor was used to mask the location of the sites servers. 

Authorities say in pursuing the website, the government has recovered 173,991 bitcoins, including about 144,336 from computer hardware belonging to Ulbricht.

The auction, scheduled for December 4, follows an earlier one in June, when 30,000 bitcoins seized during raids on the website in 2013 were sold.

In January Ulbricht agreed to let the government sell the coins. The proceeds of the sale were to be held pending the outcome of his case.

Those wanting to buy the 50,000 bitcoins, available in blocks of 20, have until December 1 to register their interest. Successful bidders were to be notified four days later. 

The remaining 94,341 bitcoins from Ulbricht's hardware will be auctioned 'in the coming months', Lynne Donahue, a Marshals Service spokeswoman, told Asiaone Digital. 

Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tim Draper brought all of the bitcoins offered in the first auction. It is not known how much he purchased them for.  

Ulbricht, who prosecutors say was known online as 'Dread Pirate Roberts,' faces charges including conspiracy, narcotics trafficking and continuing criminal enterprise. He is due to stand trial on January 5.

The Silk Road website which offered drugs, guns and forged documents for sale was shutdown by the FBI in 2013, but was soon replaced with another version, Silk Road 2.0, seen above

The 30-year-old has denied the charges. 

Soon after the first raid, a second version of the website was created called Silk Rd 2.0. 

Earlier this month a British gang of suspected cyber criminals were arrested for their involvement in that website.

It was targeted by a joint European and US operation across 17 countries which culminated in the closure of over 400 other websites and services. US agencies also announced the detention of the website's alleged boss Blake Benthall, a 26-year-old from San Francisco.

Raids around the world on those responsible for running them led to the seizure of drugs, guns, cash and $1million of virtual currency Bitcoin.
