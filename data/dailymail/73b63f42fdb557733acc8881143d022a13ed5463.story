Two Chinese officials have been arrested on suspicion of buying corpses from grave robbers in order to burn the bodies and hit government cremation targets.

The crimes, which took place in the southern Guangdong province, were uncovered after a grave robber in the city of Beiliu in neighbouring Guangxi province was caught removing a body.

He told investigators that he had been stealing corpses from tombs on the orders of two officials who had been concerned they would miss the Chinese government's controversial monthly cremation quota, which was installed to ensure enough land is given over to farming and property development.

The first reports of grave robbing in Beiliu emerged in June, when a local man contacted police to say his grandfather's tomb had been broken into and the body removed, according to Xinhua.

In China the deceased are often buried in large tombs which allow people to perform ancestor worship rituals. Veneration of the dead by living relatives in deeply rooted in Chinese culture.

In July a grave robber surnamed Zhong was arrested and confessed to stealing the body.

He added that he had also taken more than 20 other corpses from graveyards in surrounding villages, putting them into bags and transporting them into neighbouring Guangdong province.

There, he claims, two funeral management officials surnamed He and Dong purchased the bodies.

According to local media the men later told investigating officers that they had burned the corpses in order to hit a controversial monthly cremation quota.

Mr Dong is said to have paid approximately £300 each for 10 corpses, while Mr He paid roughly £150 per body. It is not yet known how many the latter ended up purchasing.

Xinhua reported the deals were allegedly 'approved' by the government, adding that since the arrests a number of other villages have come forward to report bodies missing from graves.

The monthly cremation quota has caused controversy because ancestor worship is deeply rooted in Chinese culture. Many Chinese people also believe a person's body must be left untouched in order for them to enter the afterlife without difficulty.

The regulations have led to a number of families secretly burying family members to get around the law, and there were even reports of elderly people committing suicide before the quota came into place so they could be guaranteed a traditional burial.
