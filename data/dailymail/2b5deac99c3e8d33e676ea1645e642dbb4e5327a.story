An elderly couple concerned about speeding in the quiet village where they live fell foul of authorities after erecting a fake road sign saying 'Slow - Heaven is full!'

The sign on Wotton Lane, Lympstone, east Devon, was put up by George and Mary Truell on the road which is used as a rat run between nearby Exmouth and the main road to Exeter.

Highways bosses, who say the sign is illegal and the lane’s speed limit is 60mph, have written to the Truells ordering the sign be taken down.

End of the road? George and Mary Truell from Lympstone, Devon, are pictured alongside their sign warning motorists to 'Slow - Heaven is full!'

Sign of the times: The elderly couple erected the sign after they found a rise in speeding traffic made it difficult to cross the road

But the Truells said they were refusing to remove it because it was on their land and they wanted to prevent accidents.

The sign, paid for by the Truells’ son, was put up after they said they had had difficulty crossing the road because of speeding traffic.

Mrs Truell, 84, said: 'People just drive too fast.

'We know we live on a lane and we accept the idea it has a lot of traffic on it.

'But speed is completely unnecessary and there could be bad accidents.'

Her husband, 86, who served as a soldier for 40 years, added that the sign was on his land and it was staying for the moment. 

Deterrent: Mr and Mrs Truelll hope the new sign will persuade motorists to kill their speed

Controversial: The Highways Agency has written to Mr and Mrs Truell demanding they remove the road sign

He said: 'Lympstone has been trying to get a lower speed limit in place for years.

'There are many pedestrians, cyclists, horse riders, livestock and even the Royal Marines that use that lane regularly.

'We have a garden on the other side of the road and have to cross it almost daily and it can be dangerous because of the speeding cars.

'We’re trying to highlight that with the sign.'

A Devon County Council spokesperson said they had 'received various complaints regarding this signage'.

'Our plans indicate that it is on public highway, and therefore we have asked for it to be removed.

'However, as we have received correspondence that it is on private land, we are currently trying to establish [land] ownership.'
