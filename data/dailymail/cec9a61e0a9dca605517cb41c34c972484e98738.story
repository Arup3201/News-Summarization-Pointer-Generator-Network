Fears are rising in Russia over the 
health of two dozen politicians on hunger strike in protest at a local 
election they claim was 'rigged' by Vladimir Putin's party.

The group have refused food for three
and a half weeks in the southern city of Astrakhan, and they are vowing
to continue until the authorities agree to a free poll.

'Our goal is honest elections that 
will put an end to the mafia system in Astrakhan,' said Oleg Shein, who 
says he was unfairly beaten in last month's election.

Tension: Left, Russian opposition leader Sergei Udaltsov speaks ata rally in Moscow after Oleg Shein went on hunger strike because he believed elections were rigged. Vladimir Putin, right, is being urged to intervene

Official figures show he scored 30 per cent, losing to his pro-Putin foe on 60 per cent.

A former KGB chief scored a 
victory on Monday in the runoff presidential election in Georgia's 
breakaway province of South Ossetia that has been riled by a political 
crisis over presidential succession.

A full vote count showed Leonid 
Tibilov won with 54.1 percent of the vote, local Election Commission 
Secretary Irina Gassiyeva said.

His rival, David Sanakoyev trailed with 42.6 percent and conceded the race.

Tibilov, 60, is a former KGB 
officer who became South Ossetia's security minister in 1992, shortly 
after the mountainous province the size of Rhode Island broke away from 
Georgia in a war.

But Shein says he has documentary evidence of fraud, claiming he won the contest by 47 per cent to his rival's 42 per cent.

Doctors have voiced concern about the
group with half a dozen so weak they needed treatment in hospital in 
the city, 1,000 miles southeast of MoscowÂ 

'Many can hardly talk and move,' warned the Voters' League, an opposition group.

Calls for Putin or outgoing president Dmitry Medvedev to intervene have so far fallen on deaf ears.

A top regional politician visited the hunger strikers in vain to tell them to halt.

'He told us to stop because this is causing political irritation in Moscow,' said Shein, 40, who is visibly weakening.

'We are not suicidal and we don't see electing me mayor as our goal.'

'The aim of the politicals from A Just Russia Party is clean elections,' he said.

Claims of rigged polls in national elections led to massive street protests during the winter.

After Putin won a landslide victory in the presidential poll last month, the opposition is concentrating on scoring local victories around Russia.

Determined: Activists gather to show their support for hunger-striker Oleg Shein outside the representative offices of the Astrakhan region in Moscow
