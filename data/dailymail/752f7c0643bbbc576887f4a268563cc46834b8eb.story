each pair of Toms shoes sold, a pair is then donated to a child, founder Blake Mycoksie will be giving out Toms shoes in 35 states with help from various local organizations.

'We're bringing our story home,' Toms annouced in a press release. 'Working closely with our partners here in the U.S., we're expanding our giving by helping children in need all over thecountry. This time, it's especially personal – because it's right in our own backyard.'

For the kids: Toms, the trendy and philanthropic retailer famous for its canvas slip-ons, has revealed it will give away one million pairs of shoes to American children in need by the end of 2014

Focusing on 'deeply impoverished communities,' Toms is partnering with 
U.S. schools that have 'high percentages of children that qualify for the 
National School Lunch Program or the McKinney-Vento Homeless Education 
Assistance Act,' Mr Mycoksie told told Fashionista.

Since the company’s creation seven years ago, it has given more than ten million pairs of shoes to needy children around the world.

In 2008, Toms began giving out shoes in 
America on a 'small scale,' before launching a pilot program in 
2011.

'We've gotten better at giving, and we've learned how to do it well. Now it's really time to expand our giving in the U.S.,' said Sebastian Fries, Toms' chief giving officer.

Specially developed algorithms determine how many of which sizes to send, and diversify the styles it gives away - from classic canvas shoes, to bandage-like boots and athletic sneakers for children who have been unable to participate in sports because of a lack of supportive footwear.

'Shoes help protect against things like hookworm and jigger infections,' said Mr Mycoksie.

'Here
in the U.S., our Shoe Giving Partners are using new shoes to support 
sports programs addressing child obesity and programs assisting children
without permanent housing.'

The company's prescription glasses, which launched with the same 'one-for-one' philosophy in 2011, will also be part of the new initiative.

By the end of 2013, it expects to donate eye care, via prescription glasses or medical treatment, in three states: California, New Mexico and New York.

So far, the eyesight of over 150,000 people outside of the U.S. has been restored through the initiative, according to a company press release.

'We will be able to fill a big need for prescription glasses for kids in the U.S.,' Mr Mycoksie said.
