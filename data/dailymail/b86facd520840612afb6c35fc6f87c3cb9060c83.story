A chief fire officer raped a woman in a village pub as his unwitting wife sat drinking just yards away, a court heard yesterday.

Sean Frayne, 48, allegedly followed the woman into an unused section of the building and made polite conversation before ‘forcefully’ raping her.

A court heard she kept quiet about the alleged attack for seven years until she eventually broke down and confided in a friend at a family wedding.

Once the ‘secret was out’, Frayne is alleged to have taken his wife along to confront the woman over her allegations.

The father of three earns £140,000 a year as the chief of Derbyshire’s Fire and Rescue Service. A jury was told he admitted having sex with the woman but would claim it was consensual and instigated by her.

Prosecutor Martin Hurst told the court that following the alleged sex attack in December 2006, Frayne returned to his wife Helen, who was sitting in the bar area, ‘as if nothing had happened’.

The jury was told the woman did not tell anybody about the alleged rape at the time, because of problems in her personal life.

But after she ‘poured her heart out’ to a male friend at the wedding in 2013, the man sent Frayne anonymous letters in red ink which accused him of raping her.

The notes said she would ‘accept an out-of-court settlement’ to ‘avoid publicity’ and included a phone number to contact. They threatened to report Frayne to police if he did not respond.

The woman told police she knew nothing about the male friend’s attempt to ‘achieve some sort of informal justice’ on her behalf by sending the letters.

Jurors were told she was left ‘in complete shock’ when the Fraynes visited her to ask questions about the letters.

During the meeting the defendant asked the woman if they ‘kissed and cuddled’, and said he could ‘remember being in the room then going and being sick’.

Mr Hurst said: ‘The prosecution say he was hoping all this may go away and was being explained to his wife as a drunken snog and grope.’

The woman made a formal complaint to the police in December 2013. She told officers that during the meeting with the couple, Mrs Frayne had asked her to describe intimate areas of her husband’s body.

In a videotaped interview played to Derby Crown Court, the woman, who was in her 40s at the time, told police: ‘They could remember everything about that night. It was so strange.’

During the interview, she described how Frayne exchanged pleasantries with her before suddenly attacking her.

She said: ‘He grabbed my hand and put it behind me and went towards my trousers.

‘He turned me round and I ended up face down. I remember shouting, and I don’t normally swear, “**** you, you b******”.’ She said the force of the attack caused a button to fall off her trousers. Afterwards, she said, Frayne ‘just left’.

The woman added: ‘I was left there and he was gone. I went to the toilet. I think I found my button on the floor first. I was stunned, horrified.’

Asked by the interviewing officer if she wanted to have sex with him, she replied: ‘No.’

She added: ‘I put my hand there to stop him. Whether or not I actually said “no”, I can’t remember.’

The court heard the Fraynes stopped visiting the pub in Etwall, Derbyshire, shortly after the alleged rape.

Frayne, who is suspended from duty, told police the woman turned around and kissed him passionately, before touching him to initiate sex. Mr Hurst told the jury: ‘The question is whether she was consenting.

‘If it is as she says, it is rape. If it as he says, that she instigated it and caused it to happen, that is not rape.’ He said the defence will say the case was ‘all about (getting) compensation out of a successful man’.

But pointing out the time lapse between the alleged rape and the sending of the letters, he asked the jury: ‘If it’s all about money, why all the continuing delay?’

Frayne, of Huddersfield in West Yorkshire, denies rape.

The trial, expected to last three days, continues.
