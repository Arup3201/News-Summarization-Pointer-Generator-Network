Police have begun an intense search for a suspect wanted in the shooting deaths of his ex-girlfriend and her sister in southeast Michigan who is believed to be armed and dangerous.

Cops said 24-year-old Lisa Gritzmaker, 34-year-old Amy Merrill, as well as their mother were shot at about 11:40pm on Friday in Blissfield, Michigan, about 20 miles northwest of Toledo, Ohio.Â 

Police found the women at the home after responding to a 911 call from one of the victims.

Mother: Ms Gritzmaker was married with two children, and had a third child on the way

Their mother was conscious and expected to live. State police have not released her name.

The Toledo Blade reported that both of the murdered women were mothers themselves, and Ms Gritzmaker was seven months pregnant.

Shelby Piotter-Anderson, a lifetime 
Blissfield resident and friend of both victims, told the paper: 'This 
doesn't happen in Blissfield.'

She added: 'I'm still kind of in shock. 
We've had car break-ins and other stupid little things, but I would 
never have expected this.'

Wanted: Police are looking for Thomas Fritz, Ms Merrill's ex-boyfriend, in connection to the shooting

The mother of the two victims is conscious and expected to live.

Michigan State Police Lt Mardella Horhn said Sunday that authorities are looking for 38-year-old Thomas Fritz of Sylvania, Ohio, who hasn't been charged but is wanted for questioning.

Lt Horhn said Fritz, the estranged boyfriend of Ms Merrill, is considered armed and dangerous.

State police Detective Sgt Marc Moore said in a statement: 'Fritz may be en route to Ohio. Citizens should contact police immediately and not approach him.'

Linda Butler, Merrill's neighbor, told the paper that she walked home from the fireworks at Blissfield River Raisin Festival on Friday and didn't notice anything abnormal when she passed the home.

'I heard nothing and really saw nothing until the ambulance came,' Butler said.

Fritz is a white male, is 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighs 186 pounds. He has brown hair and blue eyes.

He was released from an Ohio prison in 2008 after serving a 1-year sentence for criminal sexual conduct.

Fritz was reported to be driving a burgundy or maroon 2002 four-door Honda with Ohio plates EQP8075.
