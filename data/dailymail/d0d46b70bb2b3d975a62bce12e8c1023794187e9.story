Pizza Hut is reportedly in trouble after it released a true blue Aussie pizza featuring crusts infused with Vegemite to celebrate Australia Day - without seeking permission to use the spread's iconic branding from its owner, Kraft.

The pizza company promoted their quintessential Aussie pizza - combining two of the country's most loved foods: cheese and Vegemite - with great fanfare, including a TV ad featuring backpackers being appalled by the taste of Vegemite.

Now Mumbrella has reported Pizza Hut never sought permission from Kraft to use the brand.

Kraft’s parent company Mondelez has reportedly taken steps to protect the much-loved spread’s reputation and has forced Pizza Hut to stop its ad campaign for the Vegemite pizza branded the ‘Mitey Stuffed Crust’.

A spokesperson for Pizza Hut told Daily Mail Australia: 'For legal reasons, Pizza Hut is currently reviewing all imagery relating to the promotion of the Mitey Stuffed Crust Pizza.’ 

Daily Mail Australia has contacted  Kraft’s parent company Mondelez for comment.

‘While we can’t comment on specific matters; as the custodians of one of Australia’s most loved and iconic brands, Vegemite, we take brand protection extremely seriously. We take all appropriate action and work diligently to protect our intellectual property when the need arises,’ Mondelez told Mumbrella.

In a promo for the new pizza, the fast-food chain took to Noah's Backpackers at Bondi Beach to carry out a taste test on non Australians, in a quest to prove the pizza is 'Made for Australians'.

In the TV add Pizza Hut asks if their creation is ‘the greatest pizza in the world?’.

Not surprisingly, travellers from Spain, The Netherlands, France and Chile were appalled at Pizza Hut's latest crust-stuffer, with some describing it as 'disgusting' and 'horrible'.

The 'Mitey Stuffed Crust Pizza' takes a regular cheese-filled crust of molten mozzarella and fills it with Australia's favourite breakfast spread, but judging by this video, the Vegemite pizza craze won't be going any further than our shores.

The video begins with a booming didgeridoo playing in the background, as the Vegemite spread is squeezed onto the pizza crust.

The taste testers seem genuinely pleased that they are about to receive free pizza until they see the black crust. 'Is that a Yorkshire pudding?' a girl from the UK asks, insisting that the pizza doesn't smell that bad.

'What's the black thing' a girl from Germany asks, later questioning the cameraman on whether or not there's 'sh**' in the pizza crust.

A range of wild guesses are thrown around as the astounded backpackers try to distinguish exactly what they've eaten.

'Medicine? Petrol? Fish jam?' the men of the group say as they appear to be resisting the urge to vomit.

Two men from Chile are persistent that the Vegemite is fish jam, claiming that the substance is 'horrible'.

One man looks defeated as he realises that this is one of the most-loved foods in Australia. 'But if females in Australia like this I don't know, they're very crazy people,' he says as he relaxes with a beer. 

Cementing the fact that this pizza has been created solely for Australians, two Aussie men take to the couch a the end of the promo, and devour the controversial treat.

'That's nice, I'd have it for breakfast I reckon,' one of the men says. 'Yep, full of Vegemite keeping Aussies strong' the man in the blue hoodie says.

Pizza Hut has more than 14,000 restaurants around the world but the Vegemite crust is only available in Australia. It costs $3 extra to add to any pizza.
