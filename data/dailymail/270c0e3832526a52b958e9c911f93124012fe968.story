Manchester United have handed a trial to Glossop North End youngster Sam Grimshaw.

The 21-year-old can play at left-back or as a left-sided winger and has impressed with performances in the North West Counties League this season.

Grimshaw spent nine years at neighbours Manchester City and has attracted attention from scouts at other league clubs too this season.

Reece James has recently been loaned out to Huddersfield Town, and United are keen to boost their ranks

Grimshaw can run 100m in under 11 seconds, and is set to spend this week training at United who are keen to boost their U21 squad having loaned out Reece James to Huddersfield Town.

If Grimshaw were to sign for United, he would not be the first ex-City youth player to join the club. Earlier this year, the Old Trafford club signed Sadiq El Fitouri on an 18-month deal.

El Fitouri was recommended to the club by Paul Scholes and Phil Neville while playing for Salford during a match against United's Under 21s.

In addition, United gave a trial to Southport's Andrew Lewis last month, while Bolton defender Andy Kellett joined on loan for the season. 

Sam Grimshaw started his footballing career at Manchester City, playing in their youth team for nine years.

From there, he moved to Altrincham's youth set-up, where he captained the side on a number of occasions. He signed first-team forms in October 2012, before moving out on loan.

He spent two spells at Radcliffe Borough in the Northern Premier League Division One North, before leaving Altrincham.

He moved to Glossop North End, who have previously played in English football's top flight but now reside in the North West Counties League.

He helped the team win their FA Vase semi-final match against St Austell on Saturday (setting up a Wembley final), and has now been rewarded with a trial at Manchester United. Quite a week for the 21-year-old.
