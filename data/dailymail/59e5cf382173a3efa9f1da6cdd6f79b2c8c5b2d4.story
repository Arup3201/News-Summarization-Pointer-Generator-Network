Louis van Gaal celebrated his derby demolition in style on Sunday night as he was snapped with Manchester City women's players Toni Duggan and Isobel Christiansen in a restaurant.

Duggan uploaded a photograph on Instagram of her, Christiansen and Everton's Michelle Hinnigan at Wing's Chinese restaurant following United's 4-2 win against their great rivals City, and wrote: 'Heyyy Louis van G!!!! Nice to share a wings with you...... [sic].' Duggan later deleted the post.

Duggan has since removed the photo from Instagram and issued an apology on Facebook. Her apology read: 'I would like to apologise to all MCFC fans for the error of judgement I made last night.

'I now appreciate the significance of my actions and can assure everyone connected with Manchester City that I am proud to represent the Club and wear the shirt.'

Wing's is the go-to place for  footballers in Manchester, with England and United captain Wayne Rooney among its regulars, but the only City stars in sight were Duggan and Christiansen.

Goals from Ashley Young, Marouane Fellaini, Juan Mata and Chris Smalling won United the bragging rights, while Sergio Aguero scored twice for the visitors in the eighth and 89th minutes.

The red half of Manchester were given reason to celebrate as they moved four points clear of their noisy neighbours in the Barclays Premier League, and Van Gaal decided to let his hair down.

Asked how he planned to celebrate at his post-match press conference, Van Gaal said: 'I can go to Mr Wing's because when you win you can go. 

'When you lose then the fans are saying, "what is Mr Louis van Gaal doing? Losing and he goes to the best restaurant of Manchester?" Now I can go. Maybe I shall go.'

He did just that and was joined by his wife Truus with friends from Holland at the five-star Chinese restaurant in the city centre.

Van Gaal described humiliating City as the 'best feeling' he had since moving to Old Trafford, and added: 'This week they [the players and supporters] can go on the streets, heads up and say: "We are the better team because goal average (over the two derbies) is in our favour."'

It seems United's players followed his advice as Ander Herrera, Mata and Daley Blind were spotted painting the town red, too.

They won't be able to celebrate for too long, however, as United must prepare to visit the Premier League's runaway leaders Chelsea. Van Gaal goes up against Jose Mourinho at Stamford Bridge this Saturday, and will try to throw a spanner in the works as Chelsea aim to seal the title.

Wing's restaurant is located in Manchester city centre. It attracts a certain type of clientele... with owner Mr Wing never afraid to push for as much publicity as possible.

So, who goes there? 

The Class of '92 have eaten there, and Wayne Rooney is a regular. The England and United captain celebrated his last two birthdays there, and held a Q&A session at the restaurant.

Rooney was helping Wing's gain publicity after starring in an educational video in the build-up to the Chinese New Year on February 19. 

Radamel Falcao – the day he signed for Manchester United – tweeted a picture with agent Jorge Mendes and his lawyers, Paulo Rendeiro and Carlos Osorio, enjoying a glass of wine, some prawn crackers and a meal at Wing's.

Who is the owner?

Wing Shing Chu owns the restaurant.

He used to worked in Manchester's Chinatown before moving to Cheadle Hulme, near Stockport, and opening a Wing's restaurant there.

He was so successful, however, that he left his wife in charge of that establishment and opened his flagship restaurant in the city centre.

But I couldn't afford it, could I?

You could actually! There is an extensive a la carte menu, but there are also two set banquet options coming in at £30.90 or £44.90 per person.

Banquet B at £44.90 per person offers:

Starter - Steamed scallop in shell with garlic and glass vermicelli.

Second course - Baked lobster with ginger and spring onions.

Main courses - Crispy chilli shredded fillet steak, steamed sea bass with ginger and spring onions in soya sauce, quick-fried sea treasures (monkfish fillet, scallops and king prawns), stir-fried king prawns and Chinese greens, as well as pak far roasted duck, all served with mixed seafood fried rice.

Dessert - Fresh fruit platter.

Wing's  'kindly request for smart dress at all times (i.e. no trainers, sandals, shorts, casual sportswear)'

What about the dress code?

Wing's management 'kindly request for smart dress at all times (i.e. no trainers, sandals, shorts, casual sportswear)'.

So Falcao and Rooney cannot be turning up straight from training in their kits, unfortunately.

Clare Balding tweeted how she was at Wing's restaurant with Robin van Persie and the owner previously

Just for fun, how much food could Falcao get on  £280,000-a-week wages?

Falcao could afford to order 6,236 meals per week and still have £3.60 left over... for his bus fare home if necessary!
