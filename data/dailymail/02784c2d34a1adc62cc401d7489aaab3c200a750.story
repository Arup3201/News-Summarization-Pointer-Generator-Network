Fighting in Aleppo has spread to new areas, activists have claimed, as rebels try to expand their hold inside Syria's largest city.

Despite intense bombardment from government air power and artillery, Aleppo's insurgents have now withstood two weeks of counterattacks by President Bashar Assad's troops and are clawing toward the city centre.

Local activist Tamam Hazem says fierce clashes are going on in Bab Jnein and Sabee Bahrat districts, while the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also says fighting has extended to new parts of the city.

The claims come as Syrian military forces say they have repelled an attempted infiltration into the country by militants on the Lebanese border, according to reports by Iran's Press TV.

Officials from Iran, an ally of the Syrian government, are also racheting up the international pressure after 48 Iranians were seized by rebels just outside Damascus on Saturday.

President Assad made a rare appearance on Syrian television with Iran's security chief, Saeed Jalili, who is a senior aide to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, as Jalili continued efforts to free his countrymen.

Ahead of a international meeting on Syria planned by Tehran for Thursday, Mr Jalili said only a 'Syrian solution' would end the crisis in the country. He added that Syria is part of an 'axis of resistance' which his government would never allow to be broken.

Aleppo is Syria's commercial hub and lies close to the Turkish border, where rebels have their rear bases. If the opposition were to gain control of the city it would be a major blow to the regime.

It has been the scene of fierce fighting for over a fortnight, with clashes said to be much longer and crueller than the skirmishes that took place in the capital Damascus before opposition was put down there.

If Assad loses the city, it is likely to become the seat of any provisional government set up in opposition to his regime, turning it into a kind of Syrian Benghazi, analysts have said.

International recognition will surely follow - most probably led by the neighbouring Gulf monarchies, longtime opponents of Assad - making the position of the incumbent regime increasingly untenable.

Indications are that the fighting in 
Aleppo will not subside as quickly as in Damascus. Rebels hold the 
territory between Aleppo and the Turkish border and it has been claimed 
that mobile anti-aircraft missiles are being shipped in from Turkey 
which would quickly curtail the regime's dominance in the skies.

Britain is to give an extra £10million of funding to help more than 45,000 refugees fleeing the conflict in Syria.

International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell made the pledge as he visited the Za'atri tented refugee camp in Jordan, on the Syrian border.

The money represents a four fold increase in British aid for refugees which was previously £3million.

Mr Mitchell said: 'In the midst of its sporting triumphs at the London Olympics, Britain has not forgotten the people of Syria. Today's extra support shows we stand alongside those who have lost everything because of the actions of this ruthless regime.

'The stories I've heard today paint a horrifying picture of everyday life for hundreds of thousands of ordinary people in Syria. I've met people left with only the clothes on their backs. I've spoken to families forced to flee their homes in the dead of night, some walking miles under the constant threat of violence and death if caught trying to escape."

It will provide emergency food rations for more than 18,000 Syrian refugees, plus safe drinking water and sanitation amid the hot conditions, including for mothers and children caught up in violence.

Funding will go to three humanitarian bodies providing assistance in the region, the World Food Programme, Unicef, and UNHCR.

Approximately £5.5 million of the additional funding will be used for activities in Jordan and the remainder in Syria's other neighbouring countries, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq.

Now
clashes have spread to the city's old town, where crooked, narrow 
streets are difficult for even cars to negotiate, the effectiveness of 
the military's armoured divisions has also been damaged.

'Moving
tanks and armored vehicles to that part of Aleppo would be sheer 
suicide, because they will make an easy target for the insurgents, who 
now have anti-tank weapons,' said Yurii Raihkel in an analysis piece for
Ukrainian newspaper The Day.

Fighting has also now apparently broken out in Aleppo's Christian districts, which had hitherto remained fiercely neutral, with at least part of that community said to have taken sides with the rebels.

With airpower and armoured units neutralised, the Syrian military faces deploying infantry units to fight fierce hand-to-hand clashes with rebels to clear Aleppo. 

However, with rebel units packed with veterans of insurgencies in Libya, Afghanistan and Russia's North Caucasus, this is exactly the kind of warfare that the rebels want to fight. Well armed and battle hardened, they outclass the regular army in close combat.

The Syrian regime has suffered a series of setbacks over the past month that point to a loosening of its grip on the country.

Yesterday
Assad's prime minister Riad Hijab became the highest-ranking government
official yet to defect after he fled across the border to Jordan.

Although
Assad has been hit by a string of embarrassing defections of military 
and political figures, they have yet to cause visible changes in the 
regime's abilities on the battlefield.

The
loss of high-profile government officials, however, suggests fissures 
are reaching deeper into the ruling system and could force Assad to 
retreat further behind a cadre of loyalists.

Hijab
and an entourage of family members were expected to head next to the 
Gulf state of Qatar, a key backer of the Syrian rebels, in a further 
sign of the regional brinksmanship and gambits over Assad's fate.

The
Gulf monarchies and Turkey have strongly backed the rebel forces while 
Assad has counted on support from traditional allies such as Iran, 
Russia and China.

regime of President Assad, right

Hijab's defection is a humiliating 
blow for Assad after a string of generals and ambassadors has peeled 
away. Like nearly all prominent defectors so far, Hijab is a member of 
Syria's majority Sunnis - the Muslim sect which forms the bedrock of the
more than 17-month uprising.

His
break suggests that elements of the Sunni elite - long a pillar of 
Assad's rule - could be growing uneasy with the relentless bloodshed and
the hardline policies of Assad's minority Alawite community, which 
dominates the regime's inner circle. The Alawite sect is an offshoot of 
Shiite Islam.

Just hours 
before word of the defection got out, Assad suffered another blow in his
attempt to portray he is in control: A bomb ripped through the third 
floor of the state TV building in Damascus, wounding at least three 
employees and displaying the ability of rebels to strike in the heart of
the capital.

But power 
remains closely held within Assad's inner circle and even posts such as 
the prime minister have limited clout. Hijab's departure will not 
immediately undercut the regime's ability to fight rebels.

Syria's rebels have grown increasingly bold and capable in recent months. In July, the rebels and Syrian regime forces fought intense battles for a week in Damascus in what was the opposition fighters' biggest challenge so far in the capital.

In a brazen daylight attack, rebels commandeered a bus and snatched 48 Iranians just outside Damascus on Saturday. Iran said those abducted were pilgrims who were visiting a shrine about 10 miles south of Damascus and were on their way to the airport to return home.

But the captors claimed in a video broadcast Sunday that one of the captives was an officer of Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guards and that the 48 were on a 'reconnaissance mission' for Assad's close allies in Tehran.

Syria has been the scene of unrest since March 2011. Damascus blames 'outlaws, saboteurs, and armed terrorist groups' for the violence, claiming that it is being orchestrated from abroad.
