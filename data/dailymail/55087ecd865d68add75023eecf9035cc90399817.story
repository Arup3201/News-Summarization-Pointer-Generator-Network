Experts searching for the lost remains of the author of Don Quixote have found wooden fragments of a casket bearing his initials with bones in and around them in a crypt  in Madrid.

The remains thought to be that of Miguel de Carvantes were found underneath a chapel of a cloistered convent. 

Archaeologists made the find over the weekend during excavations to solve the centuries-old mystery of where the famed Spanish writer was laid to rest. The initials on a plank of the coffin were formed with metal tacks embedded into the wood.

On one of the wooden fragments the initials 'MC' can be clearly seen; investigators also discovered bones which they are now trying to determine whether they belong to the late author Miguel de Carvantes

The bones of at least 10 people, including children, were found inside the niche containing the broken wooden planks of the coffins

The bones of at least 10 people were found inside the niche containing the broken wooden planks of the coffin, though some of the remains belonged to children, said forensic anthropologist Francisco Etxeberria. 

Mr Etxeberria is to examine the bones to determine whether Cervantes' are among them. 

Cervantes was 69 when he died in 1616 and in accordance with his wishes, he was buried in the Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians in Madrid's historic Barrio de las Letras, or Literary Quarter. In 1673 his bones went missing when work was done at the convent.

Investigators will use clues from the author's own stories to help them identify the remains. Shortly before his death Cervantes wrote that he only has six teeth. 

But the most obvious marks will be the battle wounds that Cervantes sustained.

In 1571, the writer was wounded in the Battle of Lepanto, which pitted Ottoman Turkish forces against the Holy League, led by Spain. Aboard the ship La Marquesa, Cervantes was hit with three musket shots, two in the chest and one in his hand.

He spent several months in a hospital in Sicily, but managed to recover.

Cervantes is a towering figure in Spanish culture. His novel 'The Adventures of the Ingenious Nobleman Don Quixote of La Mancha' changed Spanish literature. 

Don Quixote was the magnum opus of Miguel de Carvantes and was published in two volumes, in 1605 and 1615.

It is considered the most influential work of Spanish literature and is considered one of the greatest works of fiction ever published. 

Carvantes influence on the Spanish language has been so great that the language is often referred to as 'the language of Cervantes'.

The author died in 1616 at the age of 69.

In accordance with his wishes, Cervantes was burried in in the Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians in Madrid's historic Barrio de las Letras, or Literary Quarter.  

His bones went missing in 1673 when work was undertaken at the convent. They were thought to have initially been taken to another convent before being returned.
