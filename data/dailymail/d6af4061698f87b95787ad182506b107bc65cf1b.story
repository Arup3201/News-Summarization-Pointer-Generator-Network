The first winter storm of 2015 is striking flashbacks of last year's polar vortex, as it conjures gusting winds, blizzard-worthy snowfall and deathly-low temperatures across much of the country. 

Fifteen states from Washington to Ohio are on high alert, as winter storm Gorgon threatens to blanket 2,000 miles of the U.S. in snow before Tuesday morning.  

Forecasters say Gorgon will strike hardest late Monday night, as it speeds up crossing the Mississippi River to hit the Midwest and East Coast with winter weather chaos.  

Gorgon will cause the most trouble on Midwestern roads, since the combination of high winds and snow will hamper visibility and freezing temperatures will render road salts useless.

Welcome to winter: The banks of Lake Michigan in Chicago, Illinois were pictured frozen on Monday, just hours before Winter Storm Gorgon's arrival in the Midwest 

At the start: Gorgon formed over the Northwestern U.S. on Sunday, and started moving east on Monday to dump several inches of snow in Montana and the Plains states. Above, Cody Charboneau shovels a walkway in front of the Blackstone building in downtown Great Falls, Montana on Monday

Across the country: Much of the northern U.S. will feel the impact of Gorgon on Tuesday. Above, a map that shows nationwide temperatures for Tuesday

Drivers in the region are also being warned to bundle up before they take to the road, in case their car becomes stuck in the road in the fatal below 10-degree temperatures.

The banks of Lake Michigan in Chicago are already freezing over, and residents there could see as much as five inches of snow by early Tuesday.

Meanwhile, in New York, rainy showers will give way to cold air and the Big Apple 'will be lucky if it hits 20' for a high and could see lows near 10 degrees, forecasters said.  

The first winter storm of 2015: Fifteen states from Washington to Ohio have issued winter storm alerts as the nation braces for Gorgon 

Powdered: Snow started falling in Rocky Mountains and Plains on Monday, with the most accumulation in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho 

Flurries: Gorgon will continue to drop snow as it makes its way to the East Coast, with the most snowfall in the Great Lakes region 

Gorgon formed Sunday over the northwest, but didn't start moving until Monday, when caused landslides in the Pacific Northwest and car accidents in the Plains states.

The several inches of snowfall and 70-mile-an-hour  winds also led to school closures in Montana, Wyoming, The Dakotas and Iowa.

Jackson Hole, Wyoming reported some of the heaviest snow fall with 17 inches Monday morning. Pine Creek Pass, Idaho saw 15.7 inches while most of the Plains received half a foot. 

Less snow is expected as the storm moves into the Great Lakes, Ohio River Valley and Appalachia, but the conditions will be worse for driving conditions in these more populated areas. 

Accumulation: On Monday, Gorgon moved out of Montana into the Plains states, where it continues to drop several inches of snow. Above, Bill Taylor crosses Main Avenue while walking from the Sioux Falls, South Dakota Family YMCA to his office downtown  on Monday, January 5, 2015

By Tuesday morning, the storm is expected to hit the East Coast cities of Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, DC and New York just in time for the commute to work. 

Only a light dusting of snow is expected in these cities, as the storm winds its way down. However, temperatures will drop and are expected to stay uncomfortably low through Thursday. 

For many parts of the country, temperatures will reach highs of just zero to the teens and twenties. 

The storm system will also bring a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain to parts of upstate New York.

In the south, even Atlanta, Georgia, will see low temperatures of around 15 degrees on Monday and Tuesday - but there is not expected to be any ice to accompany the chilly weather.

Aftermath? Lake effect snow in the Great Lakes region could be triggered in Gorgon's wake. Above, a bike commuter walks on an ice-covered path near Lake Michigan on Monday in Chicago

Cold weather: Ice covers the shore of Lake Michigan on Monday in Chicago. Forecasters expect significant snowfall and continued freezing temperatures this week in northern Illinois

Ice water: People around the state woke up to below-normal temperatures Monday. The coldest temperatures were in northern Illinois, where the National Weather Service said it was 2 degrees below zero at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.

And in the West, a stream of Pacific moisture will drop as much as six inches of rain in the Seattle area - and could mean substantial snowfall in the Cascades.

In fact, California appears to be one of the only U.S. states unaffected by the weather. The drought-ridden state will be sunny this week.   

A dip in the jet stream means cold air from Canada and points north is plummeting into the eastern two-thirds of the United States. However, forecasters are shying away from calling it a 'polar vortex'.

The forthcoming cold can be linked to the dip, according to Michael Musher, with the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland.

This is because the air is coming from near the north pole, he said. But the low-pressure system itself isn't going to sink into the United States this year, just the temperatures that precede it.  

By the end of the week, temperatures are expected to lift slightly, forecasters said.

Earlier this week, Weather Channel meteorologist Roy Lucksinger explained Gorgon as a series of 'dangerously cold 'arctic air masses thar are similar to - but not quite - last year's so-called 'polar vortex'. 

'We're looking at 50million people in 24 states seeing some of the coldest weather over the next several days that we have seen in quite some time,' CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis said.  

'This arctic cold is potentially deadly and dangerous. Wind chills in Minnesota and the Dakotas are as low as minus 45 degrees. A second blast of cold air will reinforce the deep freeze on Tuesday.' 

Speaking to USA Today, National Weather Service meteorologist Paul Kocin added: 'This is going to be a big cold outbreak, pretty windy as well. It's going to drive all the way down south.' 

Worrying: A series of 'dangerously cold'  arctic air masses will strike almost everywhere east of the Rockies on Monday (pictured), bringing freezing temperatures to more than 50million people, forecasters have said
