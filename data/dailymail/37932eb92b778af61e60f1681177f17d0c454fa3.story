The Church of England was in turmoil last night after its firm opposition to assisted dying began to crumble following the intervention of Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury.

As the Church’s rejection of the right to die was challenged by more senior Anglicans, CofE leaders called for a proposed law change to be delayed so a Royal Commission could subject the issue to high-level public debate. 

The argument over assisted dying has joined same-sex marriage and women bishops as key sources of division for Anglicans.

Archbishop
 of Canterbury Justin Welby, left, warned a proposed new law on assisted dying 
is ‘mistaken and dangerous’, but his predecessor Lord Carey, right, insists it 
would not be ‘anti-Christian’ to change the law

The debate burst into the open on 
Saturday when Lord Carey wrote in the Mail that helping someone who is 
in great pain to die was in keeping with Christian belief. 

He
 said it was not anti-Christian to believe terminally ill people should 
be allowed to die with dignity.

On the same day, however, the Archbishop
 of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said he would oppose a Bill to legalise 
assisted dying put forward by former Labour Lord Chancellor Lord 
Falconer.

Archbishop Welby 
said it would leave a ‘sword of Damocles’ hanging over the elderly, 
putting them under pressure to end their lives.

Yesterday
 Lord Carey’s views were supported by Desmond Tutu, the former 
Archbishop of Cape Town, who said he wanted to focus on ‘dignity for the
 dying’. 

In an article in the Observer, he wrote: ‘I revere the sanctity of life – but not at any cost.’

Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu says he would not like his life to be 'prolonged artificially'

Lord
 Falconer’s Assisted Dying Bill would require patients to administer the
 poison themselves. It  would not help those who are paralysed or lack 
the capacity to operate a mechanism to inject the drugs. 

Existing
 rules effectively mean no relative or friend will be prosecuted for 
aiding a suicide if it is done out of compassion and not for gain. But 
they ban British doctors taking any role in a death.

Falconer’s
 Bill would enable doctors to help a patient die by prescribing deadly 
drugs if they are  terminally ill and expected to die within six months.

The patient would have to be over 18 and to have lived in England or Wales for at least a year. 

Two
 doctors would have to certify the patient was terminally ill and it was
 their informed wish to die. The patient would also have to signify 
their consent. There would be 14 days before drugs were provided, or six
 days if death was expected within a month.

The
 man described as the ‘moral conscience of South Africa’ condemned as 
‘disgraceful’ how Nelson Mandela was kept alive by gruelling hospital 
treatment.

Lord Falconer said 
Lord Carey’s article was ‘profoundly significant’, adding: ‘It seemed to
 me to express views held by very many committed Anglicans. It provided 
real leadership for the alternative view. He made absolutely clear that 
there is no Christian reason to oppose assisted suicide.

‘I
 respect the views of those who oppose. The significance of the Carey 
and the Tutu interventions is that there is nothing anti-Christian about
 supporting assisted dying.’ He added that he worried critics of the 
Bill would try to scupper it when it is debated in the House of Lords on
 Friday.

He told The Guardian:
 ‘I fear that somebody may put a wrecking amendment down. That finishes 
it off for that session. I am urging all my supporters to come on Friday
 to vote down such a motion.’

The Bishop of Buckingham, the Right 
Reverend Alan Wilson, yesterday became the first serving bishop to back 
the right to die.

He said: ‘I 
have come to support assisted dying precisely because I do believe 
strongly in the sanctity of life.

'Part of honouring this is respecting 
people’s integrity to make decisions about themselves.’

Former Labour Cabinet minister Lord Falconer is proposing a change in the law to allow someone with less than six months to live to be prescribed a lethal dose by doctors

Lord Carey said he had dropped his opposition to assisted dying  ‘in the face of the reality of needless suffering’.

But
 on Saturday, Archbishop Welby wrote in The Times: ‘I know of health 
professionals who are already concerned by the ways in which their 
clients have suggestions “to go to Switzerland” whispered in their ears 
by relatives weary of caring for them and exasperated by seeing their 
inheritances dwindle through care costs.’

Senior CofE figures have now called for a Royal Commission.

The
 Bishop of Carlisle, the Right Reverend James Newcome, urged Lord 
Falconer to withdraw his Bill to make way for such a commission, adding:
 ‘We were surprised by the content of Lord Carey’s article, but... it 
has brought the issues to the forefront of public discussion.’

About right: Sir Chris Woodhead is backing the bill

Sir Chris Woodhead, the former chief inspector of schools who is now a quadriplegic, yesterday gave his backing to Lord Falconer’s Assisted Dying Bill.

He believes the proposals are ‘about right’ and in tune with public opinion.

And he said the Falconer law would allow doctors who help suffering patients to die to be free from the threat of prosecution and career disaster.

‘They would have the option and they would know that they were not going to be prosecuted under any circumstance.’ 

Sir Chris made his reputation challenging the educational establishment over school standards in the 1990s. He was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2006 and subsequently told he has cancer and other complications.

He told the Murnaghan programme on Sky News that the decision to end one’s life ‘must be a matter for consideration within the family and arguably with close friends as well’. 

‘I wouldn’t dream of proceeding with the decision to kill myself or to have my death assisted without the acceptance of those who are nearest and dearest to me,’ he said.

The Falconer proposals were ‘about right, given the range of public opinion on this issue’. Alternatives were ‘bleak’.

‘I would be far better if I could have my death assisted in a peaceful, dignified way so that my suffering wasn’t prolonged.’
