Miracle:  Dave Watson, from Walton-le-Dale, Lancashire, is a triple amputee but managed to pass his driving test first time

A war hero who lost both legs and his right arm in a bomb blast is celebrating after passing his driving test at the first attempt.

Triple amputee Dave Watson, 26, was moments from death when he stepped on an improvised explosive device on foot patrol.

But this week the former Guardsman tore up his 'L' plates after passing his test at the first time of asking - with just three 'minors'.

Mr Watson, of Walton-le-Dale, Lancashire, had 38 lessons in a three month period in his specially modified Range Rover Sport and has now got a full driving licence.

He said: 'I can go wherever I want. It means I will be more independent.'

The specially modified car has a special box on the driver's door where Mr Watson puts his right arm.

He pushes forward to brake and pulls backwards to accelerate.

And there is small handle on the steering wheel for him to hold on to for steering, which also has buttons indicators, wipers and lights.

Currently waiting for another operation on his prosthetic, Mr Watson has to have someone with him while he is driving but will be able to go out on his own after the surgery.

Mr Watson said he picked up the skill quite quickly. 'I am one of those people, I'm no good at sitting there and reading but I can do the practical stuff,' he said.

'I went out when I got back from the test after sorting the insurance out and drove to my grandma's, took my brother to his mate's then I went to my mate's house to see him before he leaves for Australia.'

The next step for Dave is to have some more motorway lessons.

War hero Mr Watson not only passed despite missing three limbs but did so with just three 'minors'
