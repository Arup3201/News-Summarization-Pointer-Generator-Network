It is 70 years since the Ministry of Food’s leaflets taught Britons to eat well on rations and stay ‘fit for the fight’ during the Second World War.

But much of the long-forgotten dietary advice still stands and, says a leading nutritionist, could help improve our diet today.

A new book, Eating For Victory, reproduces the leaflets distributed along with posters in the 1940s.

Here is some of the advice as it was printed. It’s accompanied by wartime illustrations – with a modern interpretation of the old wisdom...

A new book, Eating For Victory, contains posters which were distributed by the Ministry of Food to try and encourage Britons to eat healthily during WWII. Dr Carrot, pictured, and his companion Potato Pete were two of the Ministry of Food's most popular creations

POTATOES

There is no vegetable more useful than the homely potato. It is a valuable yet cheap source of energy, and one of the foods that help to protect us from ill-health.

It contains Vitamin C and 1lb of potatoes daily will give half the amount of this vitamin needed to prevent against fatigue and fight infection.

So don’t think of potatoes merely as something to serve with the meat. A stuffed baked potato can be a course in itself. 

Bridget Benelam, a scientist at the British Nutrition Foundation, says: ‘A medium-sized baked potato, with skin, provides a third of the recommended daily amount (RDA) of Vitamin C – twice that of an apple.

It will also provide half the RDA of potassium – important for blood pressure and water balance – iron, zinc and B vitamins.’

The homely potato: Britons were encouraged to eat potatoes in the 1940s, pictured left, as they are a cheap source of energy and packed full of vitamin C. Leaflets were also distributed encouraging people to eat cheese because it is a 'concentrated energy-giving food', pictured right

CHEESE

Cheese is an A1 food because it is an excellent body-builder, better than meat for building firm muscles. It builds strong bones and teeth, too. Therefore, it is invaluable for growing children. Plenty of cheese in childhood means less dental trouble in later life.

It is a concentrated energy-giving 
food, especially suitable for heavy workers as it gives a large amount 
of energy in small bulk. It contains a high proportion of fat and so gives a feeling of satisfaction after a meal.

Eat like a granny: Bridget Benelam says much of the advice given in the 1940s is still relevant today

Bridget says:
‘A matchbox-sized serving, 30g, of cheese provides a quarter of our 
daily calcium needs – crucial for maintaining bone density – although 
milk or yogurt might be better choices as they are lower in fat.

‘Cheese is as good a source of protein as meat but generally contains more fat, so should be eaten less.’

HERRINGS

‘Of
all the fish that swim in the sea,’ runs the old saying, ‘the herring 
is the king.’ Consider the herring’s food value. It is a very cheap 
source of the best body-building protein.

Herring
oil not only supplies an extraordinarily high number of calories and 
energy-giving units, but it also contains two vitamins, A and D. Vitamin
A strengthens resistance to disease and Vitamin D is essential for 
bones and teeth.

Bridget says:
‘This is still true – herrings are an excellent source of fish oil. 
Research since the 1940s has shown the omega 3 in oily fish is important
for good heart and brain health.

'We should eat two portions of fish a week, one oily. Nowadays other types of fish are readily available, such as tuna.’

DRIED EGGS

Dried egg is pure fresh egg with no additions, and nothing but the moisture taken away. It is pure egg, spray-dried.

Eggs
contain first-class body-building material. They also help us to resist
colds and other infection because of their high protective properties. 
They are easily digested, and for this reason are especially good for 
children and invalids.

Bridget says:
‘Transporting food is easy now so we generally eat only fresh eggs. Two
medium eggs provide your entire RDA of B12, important for blood and 
brain function, and 60 per cent of our Vitamin D requirement. They are 
also high in protein.’

King of the sea: Herring was a cheap, readily-available fish that provided a lot of protein and vitamins, pictured right, while Britons were encouraged to eat dried eggs for their protein, Vitamin D and B12 content, pictured right, as food transportion in the 1940s wasn't what it is today and fresh eggs were harder to come by

VITAMINS

Enemies
of Vitamins: air, water, heat. Too much of any of these will destroy 
the Vitamin C. Therefore, have your vegetables as fresh as possible.

Best
of all, grow them yourself. Wash your vegetables in salted water but do
not soak them overlong. Shred them before cooking to cook quickly.

Bridget says:
‘Oxidisation occurs when certain vitamins in food are exposed to heat, 
air or light, meaning they degrade and become ineffective. This is 
particularly true of Vitamin C, often lost in cooking water.

'It is best not to cut up veg in advance as the air will degrade the vitamins. Steaming is the best method of cooking.’

GREEN VEGETABLES

When
fresh fruit is short, we need green vegetables more than ever because 
they all contain the important fresh-fruit vitamin, Vitamin C.

Some have more than others. Brussels sprouts, parsley and watercress 
all contain more than oranges. For healthy eating, plan to have a green 
leafy vegetable at least once every day.

Bridget says: ‘This
all holds true – vegetables can have just as much Vitamin C as fruit. 
In fact, a pepper contains double the Vitamin C of an orange and will 
provide your entire daily requirement.

‘Dark
green leaves are an important source of antioxidants, which protect 
cells from a host of diseases from cancer to age-related sight loss.’

SOUPS AND BROTHS

Once upon a time cooks used to think a good soup needed three or four hours’ cooking, and that to be nourishing it must be made from meat and bones.

Today we know better. Tasty soups can be made quickly using vegetables and vegetable water, or stock from meat cubes or vegetable extract.

Bridget says: ‘Soup has a good reputation for being healthy because it’s low-calorie but fills you up because it contains a lot of water.

'The vegetables added will provide different vitamins, which won’t be lost in cooking as they just leach into the liquid.

'Soup can also be high in fibre, which keeps the gut healthy. Stock cubes can be high in salt, though.’
