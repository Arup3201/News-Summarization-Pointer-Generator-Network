Bob Diamond was yesterday accused of lying to MPs about the unfolding scandal at Barclays – but will still walk away from the bank with a £2million golden goodbye and millions of pounds’ worth of shares.

Labour MP John Mann said the 60-year-old American, who resigned last week, had ‘calculatedly and deliberately misled’ MPs over the Libor rate-fixing scandal that has engulfed his company.

The attack came after an explosive select committee hearing yesterday, 
in which a damning letter from the Financial Services Authority to 
Barclays appeared to make a mockery of Mr Diamond’s claims that he had 
enjoyed the watchdog’s confidence.

Intervention: Bank of England boss Sir Mervyn King summoned Barclays bosses to an emergency meeting and told them that Bob Diamond had to go

Severance: Barclays chairman Marcus Agius told the Treasury Select Committee that Bob Diamond has agreed to waive bonus awards and long-term incentive shares worth a potential £20 million

The letter was sent by FSA chairman Lord Turner to Barclays chairman 
Marcus Agius on April 10 this year, and concerns the discovery that 
Barclays had unethically tried to manipulate the Libor interbank lending
rate.

It noted an ‘unfavourable’ impact on the ‘degree of external trust in 
Barclays’ approach’ and accuses the bank’s bosses of being ‘at the 
aggressive end of interpretation of the relevant rules and regulations’ 
and trying to ‘spin its messages in an unhelpful fashion’.

Tory MP David Ruffley asked Mr Agius, 65, yesterday whether he had 
received such a ‘damning’ letter during his long career in the City.

Bob Diamond: Giving up his bonus

Senior Bank of England staff discussed buying bikes to get around the City as a strategy to cope with crisis, a former minister revealed yesterday.

Lord Myners, who was Labour’s City minister from 2008 to 2010, recalled the plan, proposed before the financial crisis hit.

Casting doubt on whether the Bank should be handed extra powers, the former member of its Court of Directors told peers of a meeting he attended in ‘2006 or 2007’.

He said: ‘One of the governors [there] proposed that as a mechanism to cope with crisis, the Bank should buy ... bicycles.

‘This tells you a huge amount about where the Bank sits in terms of its understanding of the complexity of financial markets.’

He raised the issue in the committee stage of the Financial Services Bill.

The Government’s regulation shake-up will see  the Bank take over many responsibilities previously held by the Financial Services Authority.

Mr Agius said: ‘I have not had another letter similar to this.’

But last week, Mr Diamond told MPs that the FSA was ‘specifically 
pleased’ with him and some of his fellow executives. When asked if the 
FSA had said it no longer had confidence in his senior management team, 
he replied: ‘No, sir.’

Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, told Mr
Agius yesterday: ‘We did not feel that we got much clarity or openness 
from Mr Diamond’s testimony’.

Wednesday June 27: The banking industry is engulfed in a fresh scandal after Barclays pays £290 million to settle claims that it used underhand tactics to try to rig financial markets. Bob Diamond, who was in charge of Barclays Capital at the time the breaches occurred between 2005 and 2009, apologises and says he and three other key executives would waive their bonuses for this year.Thursday June 28: Serious Fraud Office investigators are in talks with the FSA over the scandal while pressure is mounting on Mr Diamond to stand down.Saturday June 30: An urgent independent review into the inter-bank lending rate is to be set up by the Government in the wake of the interest rigging scandal. The review will consider the future operation of the Libor rate and the possibility of introducing criminal sanctions, a Treasury source says.Mr Diamond is summoned to appear before the Treasury Select Committee on the following Wednesday.Sunday July 1: Barclays Bank chairman Marcus Agius is reported to be on the brink of stepping down. The development comes as Business Secretary Vince Cable backs calls for a criminal investigation into bankers involved in the affair.

Tuesday July 3: Mr Diamond announces he is stepping down with immediate effect.

Tuesday July 10: Mr Diamond gives up £20m in bonuses and shares but takes away around £2 million in salary and pension payments.

Afterwards, Mr Mann said: ‘Mr Diamond’s evidence [last Wednesday] is not
worth the transcript it was written on. We now know he misled 
Parliament. He should be recalled.’

But Mr Diamond last night hit back in a letter to Mr Tyrie, saying: ‘I 
was dismayed that you and some of your fellow committee members appear 
to have suggested that I was less than candid.

‘Any such suggestion would be totally unfair and unfounded.’

It also emerged yesterday that Mr Diamond’s resignation was triggered by Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King.

Mr Agius, who also resigned last week, told MPs how he was ordered to 
the Bank for an emergency meeting at 6pm on Monday last week, in which 
Sir Mervyn made it clear that Mr Diamond had to leave.

The conversation was ‘not capable of being misinterpreted’, Mr Agius 
said. Following this conversation, Mr Agius visited Mr Diamond at home.

Mr Tyrie said Sir Mervyn had handed ‘a loaded revolver’ to Mr Agius. Mr Diamond resigned at 7.30am the next day.

Despite his humiliating departure, Mr Diamond, who has made around 
£120million from Barclays over the past five years, will be paid his 
‘basic’ salary of £1.35million for the next year plus a lump sum cash 
pension contribution of £675,000.

Yesterday he promised to give up any rights to bonuses or share awards 
worth up to £20million which he had expected over the next few years. 
But he still has 13.2million Barclays shares, currently worth around 
£22million.

Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott said: ‘£2million or £20million as a reward 
for failure for Mr Diamond? Only Barclays’ board will care. Both are 
just as grotesque to people who won’t earn £2million in their lifetime.’

Denial: Paul Tucker, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, told the Treasury Select Committee he did not encourage the manipulation of Libor by Barclays

Running man: Chancellor George Osborne, pictured jogging yesterday , is under pressure to bring in massive banking reforms because of the Libor scandal

David Cameron does not believe that 
Chancellor George Osborne needs to apologise for suggesting that former 
Labour ministers including Ed Balls were involved in the Barclays 
rate-fixing scandal, the Prime Minister's spokesman said today.

Labour
is demanding an apology after Bank of England deputy governor Paul 
Tucker denied yesterday that any minister or Whitehall official 
encouraged him to 'lean on' Barclays to lower its submissions to the 
crucial Libor index.

Conservative
MP Andrea Leadsom, a member of the Commons Treasury Committee which 
heard Mr Tucker's denial, said Mr Osborne had clearly made a mistake and
should now apologise.

And
Tory former chancellor Lord Lamont said Mr Osborne had 'overplayed his 
hand'. Lord Lamont told BBC2's Daily Politics: 'If there is an 
allegation Ed Balls was involved, it doesn't stand up. That is clear.'

Mr
Cameron's official spokesman was asked at a regular media briefing this
morning whether the Prime Minister agreed it was time for the 
Chancellor to say sorry.

The spokesman said: 'The Treasury has been making the position clear that he won't. He (Mr Cameron) agrees with the Treasury.'

Speaking
to The Spectator magazine last week, Mr Osborne said that figures 
around Labour's former PM Gordon Brown were 'clearly involved' in 
efforts to persuade Barclays to understate the interest rates it was 
being charged in 2008, at the height of the financial crisis.
