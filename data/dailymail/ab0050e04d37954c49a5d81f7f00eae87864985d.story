In a welcome break from the wet and windy weather that has battered the UK in the last few weeks, early risers and wildlife alike were making the most of the autumnal sunshine this morning.

The crisp, yet pleasant start to the day around most of the country highlighted stunning hues of red, orange and gold in woodlands and forests across England and Wales.

But the bright start was just a short hiatus from the unsettled weather that looks set to continue into next week.

According
to the Met Office, people would do well to keep their wellies and 
umbrellas at the ready, as Britain is on track to suffer its wettest 
autumn for 12 years.

The 
southwest has seen five times the usual amount of rain so far this, 
drastically increasing the risk of floods for the forthcoming week.

The
Met Office warned of ‘no let up’ with showers tomorrow and Monday, 
followed by blustery showers on Tuesday and rain for all on Wednesday - 
with a severe weather alert issued for floods in the southwest.

Temperatures
in the south-east will hover around 14 to 15 degrees Celsius, with 
Scotland experiencing a cooler 9 to 10 degrees Celsius on average 
throughout the beginning part of the week.

While
Monday will have "a decent bit of sunshine," the risk of showers will 
remain high, with a weather system from the Atlantic bringing a swathe 
of persistent rain by the evening.

Met Office forecaster George Goodfellow said the weather was "fairly typical" for autumn, although parts of the country will experience greater amounts of rain and gale-force winds.

The outlook to October 27 said: ‘Continuing very unsettled with rain or showers for most parts, occasionally heavy, with strong winds.’

England and Wales were drenched by 132mm of rain from September 1 to October 10 and with no sun on the horizon, the UK is on track to push the September and October rainfall total to around 220mm. This is the highest since 2000, the wettest autumn on record, when 302mm fell.

St

October average of 27mm. Cornwall’s 107mm at Camborne is more than 300 
per cent of the usual 34mm.

This autumn’s downpour is especially 
dramatic as a majority of the rain has fallen in the past three weeks. 
Met Office forecaster Dave Britton said: ‘The first three weeks of 
September saw relatively little rain.’

British
Weather Services tweeted: ‘Three significant bands of rain will fall 
over the next week, with already high river levels and water tables.’

Met
Office forecaster Charlie Powell said: ‘There’s no let up in the 
pattern, with bands of rain next week interspersed with drier periods.’

The
Met Office added: ‘Ground in the South-West remains saturated and the 
threat of further heavy on Wednesday means the public are advised to be 
aware localised flooding is a risk.
