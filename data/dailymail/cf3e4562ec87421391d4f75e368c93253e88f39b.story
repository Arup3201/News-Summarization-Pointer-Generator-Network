Lollipop ladies are being fired by councils to pay for ’Stasi surveillance’ CCTV cameras, the government has claimed.

Town halls are accused of buying ’spy cars’ as an excuse to generate fines from parents on the school run on an ’industrial scale’.

Local government minister Brandon Lewis warned public trust in CCTV for crime fighting is being undermined by councils using it to generate cash.

We're watching you: CCTV cars were legalised in 2004 and there are now more than 100 in use across Britain. Fines worth at least £30 million were handed out last year - but almost half the people who appealed won

Mr Lewis took particular issue with the claim from the Local Government Association the coalition’s move to ban CCTV parking cameras ’will put children at risk’.

He said: ’This is a false and spurious claim. CCTV spy cars are a recent and modern innovation from legislation passed by the last Labour Government.

’They are just an excuse for councils to raise money from issuing parking fines on an industrial scale.

’They undermine natural justice, as car owners receive the fine weeks later in the post making it extremely hard to challenge on appeal.’

He insisted the changes would not stop a traffic warden or police officer issuing a penalty notice in the case of genuinely dangerous parking.

With more than 100 specially adapted cars across Britain, 'mobile CCTV' has become the bane of many motorists' lives.

The
 technology was legalised under Labour in 2004, allowing councils to 
break from the tradition of always using traffic wardens.

Since then more councils have
 brought in the technology every year - but while a traffic warden can 
be reasoned with, said critics, a machine cannot.

High-profile 'victims' included one driver who pulled over to vomit and another whose windscreen had smashed.

Drivers
 who feel they have been wronged can take their cases to a Traffic 
Penalty Tribunal, a network of independent adjudicators, or a parallel 
system for London.

Adjudicators
 often criticise councils and have questioned their definition of the 
'difficult or sensitive' circumstances in which CCTV fines should be 
given out.

Richmond 
Council, south west London, faced having to repay thousands of fines in 
2011 after campaigner Nigel Wise discovered its four cars had not been 
properly registered.

But in response to a parliament question he added: ’It is hard-pressed parents who get hit with the fines from such Stasi surveillance.

’Public confidence is strengthened in CCTV if it is used to tackle serious crime, not to raise money for town halls by penalising parents dropping off kids on the school run.

’In their rush to bankroll CCTV spy cameras for parking enforcement, it would appear from recent media reports that parts of local government have had no qualms about sacking lollipop men and women.

’Crossing patrols do a sterling job in protecting children from danger—but, unfortunately, unlike spy cars, they do not raise money for council coffers.’

Official figures councils which use CCTV cameras to enforce parking rules raise £49.35 per household each year, compared with £5.69 per household in council areas which do not have them.

The Local Government Association has heavily criticised government plans to ban the use of CCTV cameras, with parking wardens only allowed to film if vehicles break the rules,

Peter Box, chairman of the LGA's Economy and Transport Board, said: 'Camera cars have been instrumental in keeping children from being hurt or killed on the way to school, and CCTV also plays an important role elsewhere in monitoring traffic flow and keeping cars moving.

'It is impossible for councils to regulate parking outside thousands of schools by using wardens alone.

'Camera cars are deployed in response to pleas by parents and teachers about cars being parked illegally and recklessly outside the school gates.

'CCTV cars are a highly visible deterrent for those breaking the law and councils will often send warnings to drivers of the consequences of their actions before issuing them with parking fines.

;Banning councils from acting on these community concerns and using CCTV outside schools will put children at risk and leave them and their parents to run the gauntlet of the school run without any protection.'
