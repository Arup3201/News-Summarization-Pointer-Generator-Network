An 18-year-old girl who was accidentally impaled with a golf club at a frat part on her second day of college is on the road to recovery.

Natalie Jo Eaton of Harrisburg, Arkansas, has been moved out of Regional Medical Center in Memphis, Tenn., where she had been since the incident occurred on Aug. 19, and is now beginning what will be intense spinal cord rehabilitation at Shepherd's Center in Atlanta.

Her mother shared the good news by posting a photo of her daughter in a wheelchair today.

Keep praying: Natalie Jo Eaton's mother shared this photo of he daughter as she starts rehab for a spinal injury suffered after she was accidentally impaled by a golf club

She asks that everyone continue to pray for her daughter. 

According to authorities, Eaton was attending a rush party at Arkansas State University's Kappa Alpha fraternity, having a cookout and playing games around 6 pm on Aug. 19 when a 19-year-old man threw a football at a 20-year-old man, and the 20-year-old hit it baseball-style with a golf club.

But when the club made contact with the football, the shaft snapped and hurled at Eaton, traveling over 30 ft. and impaling her in the neck.

Doctors say the club hit a major artery and her spinal cord and initially told friends and family she may be paralyzed.

But the immediate response of the man who caused the accident may have reduced that threat.

'His quick reactions probably saved her life,' said Eaton's best friend Makaleigh Riddle.

The unnamed student held Eaton's head up for 15 minutes, applying pressure to the wound, until an ambulance showed up.

Eaton was then taken to St Bernard's in critical condition, before then being transferred to Memphis.

No charges have been reported, but university officials said shortly after the incident in August that they didn't expect students to face any, according to NBC 5.
