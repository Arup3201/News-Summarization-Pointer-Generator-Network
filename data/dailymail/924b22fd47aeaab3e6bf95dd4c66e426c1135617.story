A 'devastated' grandmother whose daughter and two grandsons were killed in a house fire today paid tribute to them.

Lynn Leighton's daughter Josie, 32, and her grandchildren Tyler and Jordan Green, aged nine and 12, died in the blaze in North Wingfield, Derbyshire along with Claire James, 27.

Ms James' seven-year-old daughter Tia was the only person who managed to escape when the fire broke out in the pebble-dashed terraced home yesterday morning.

Tributes: Flowers are left outside the house in North Wingfield, Derbyshire, today where two mothers and two boys died yesterday morning

A stream of mourners were leaving flowers outside the property today as a policeman stood guard at the scene.

Officers have refused to speculate on the
cause of the blaze despite reports suggesting a portable heater could 
have been responsible.

In a statement released through police, Lynn Leighton paid tribute to her daughter and two grandsons who died in the fire.

'Josie was a lovely, loving daughter who had lots of friend,' she said.

'Tyler was always happy. He loved life, he loved school and was always full of beans. Jordan was a real character. He loved his family, specially his grandma and always had lots of friends.

'They will all be greatly missed. We are devastated by what has happened and we ask for privacy at this time to allow the whole family to grieve.'

It is thought that Miss Leighton, a 
care home worker, had recently separated from her partner. She and her 
sons were staying with Miss James while they looked for somewhere else 
to live.

A friend said that both women, who were 
single mothers, had known each other for a number of years and shared 
childcare.

Post-mortem examinations are being carried out on the four fire victims today to establish the cause of death.

Outside the house, Ian and Emma Smith said their immediate thoughts were with Tia who escaped the blaze.

The girl was treated for minor smoke inhalation yesterday before being released from hospital.

Speaking
through tears, Mrs Smith said: 'I just hope that little girl is all 
right - she's lost her mother just before Christmas.

'We're
trying to run around collecting clothes, toys and whatever we can to 
donate to her family so she's got something. We'd do anything to help 
that child.

'She will have everything she wants, even if my kids have to go without their Christmas presents.'

She said a collection campaign had also started on social media for the bereaved youngster.

Mrs
Smith added: 'I have eight kids myself, and just to go and see that 
house after what has happened it is just the most awful, terrible thing 
imaginable. I cannot understand the pain their families must be in.'

Respects: A series of mourners have visited the property today to pay their respects to the two mothers and two boys who died in the fire

The fire brigade were on the scene within eight minutes of a neighbour raising the alarm at 4.58am yesterday.

Firefighters
arrived to find the young girl in the back garden and got her to 
safety, then battled 'arduous conditions' inside in a bid to rescue the 
other occupants.

Ms James 
and Ms Leighton were pronounced dead at the scene while young Tyler and 
his brother Jordan were pronounced dead later at Chesterfield and 
District Royal Hospital.

The
house's exterior bears few signs of the deadly blaze, with a pair of 
child's shoes discarded in the front porch and broken glass littering 
the garden.

Remains: Shoes can be seen inside the front door of the damaged property where four people died

Fire safety 
officers have been carrying out community checks in the area today, 
while specialist police family liaison officers are continuing to 
support bereaved loved ones.

Speaking at the scene yesterday chief inspector Rick Gooch, of Derbyshire Police, said: 'It is a tragic event.

'The impact on the community is obviously recognised and together we are working through that with the family.'

The blaze is the fourth in Derbyshire in just three and a half years in which children have died.

In April 2010, five-year-old Niamh 
Adams and her brother Cayden, two, were killed in a fire at their home 
in Buxton. Their mother, Fiona Adams, was charged with their murders but
later cleared.

Tommy Henson, nine, Alisha 
Henson-Nulty, six, Rocco Henson-Nulty, four, and Appolonia Henson, two, 
died after a stray spark from a log fire started an inferno in their 
home in Hulland Ward in January 2011.

And in May last year Jade Philpott, 
ten, and her brothers Duwayne, 13, John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six, 
and Jayden, five, were killed when their parents Mick and Mairead 
started a blaze at their home in Derby along with family friend Paul 
Mosley.
