Steve McClaren and his players will try to emulate Leicester City and Reading by responding to play-off heartbreak with automatic promotion next season.

Nigel Pearson’s side won the Championship title this year, 12 months after losing dramatically to Watford in the semi-finals. Brian McDermott got Reading promoted as champions in 2012 having lost the 2011 play-off final to Swansea.

McClaren (below) admitted there was ‘anger, sadness and remorse’ at the manner of their 1-0 defeat by Queens Park Rangers having dominated the match, but insisted Derby would not change their style of play.

He is keen to secure George Thorne, 21, the West Bromwich Albion midfielder who shone at Wembley, on another loan deal or permanent basis.

He would also look to bring back Andre Wisdom and Patrick Bamford, who were on loan from Liverpool and Chelsea respectively.

‘We’ll get the players together and reflect on what we have achieved this season,’ said McClaren. ‘When we came in we never dreamed we’d be third with 85 points and top scorers.

‘The key thing is the style. It takes courage because you have to take risks and sometimes we’ve lost because of that but most of the times we’ve won. We didn’t win at Wembley but we have to keep that style because I enjoy watching it and the players enjoy playing it. The fans like the product.

‘They’re all the positives and there’s only been one real negative and it’s very cruel.We’ll look at the examples of Leicester and Reading.

'They had disappointment and went on to get promoted the next season. It takes character. We’ve shown that for seven months — we have to show it again next season.

‘I’d like to sort  out the likes of  Wisdom, Thorne and Bamford. Thorne was the best player on the field. Maybe we have a chance because I think they’ve enjoyed their time here.’

Defender Jake Buxton said: ‘It was like a dagger to the heart. That is football. We have to dust ourselves down and get on with it next season.

'Steve sat in front of 30 or 40 blokes in the dressing room and said we will improve and be up there next season and that is what we believe.

‘It was quiet, not the time to be  rollicking people. You can’t change what happened. We have to get back in July and have a right go. If we keep most of the squad and add a few then hopefully we will be promoted.’

Buxton believes McClaren has the connections to make the right signings, adding: ‘He has the contacts.’

Striker Chris Martin said captain Richard Keogh was inconsolable after the game, having made a hash of a clearance that allowed Bobby Zamora to strike the winning goal. Even QPR players accepted they had got lucky, according to Martin.

‘I think Rich feels like he’s let us down but everyone told him, “Listen, you’ve not let us down, if it wasn’t for you we wouldn’t be in this position”.

‘We win as a team, we lose as a team. That has been the key to our success this season.

‘I think we need to take the positives out of it. We put on a good performance, the only thing missing was a goal.

'Congratulations to them, they battled hard, defended for their lives and managed to nick it.

‘They appreciated that, a few of their lads came up at the end and said it was daylight robbery almost.’
