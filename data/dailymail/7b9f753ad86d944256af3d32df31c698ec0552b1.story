Archeologists who uncovered the first homosexual caveman have discovered the prehistoric village where he was 'the only gay' man.

The male skeleton - believed to be nearly 6,000 years old - was found buried in the same way that Neolithic communities buried women, suggesting he was a different sexuality.

Now the same team of experts have discovered what they believe was his home village near Prague in the Czech Republic.

Czech archaeologists who uncovered what they believed was the world's first gay cavemen have located the village he belonged to nearby

Dig director Radek Baly - from the Czech Archaeological Society - said: ¿We have managed to unearth impressions of wooden supporting structures of so-called long houses, typical of the Neolithic period.¿

Y-M-C-Cave: The skeleton was found in a Prague suburb with its head pointing eastwards and surrounded by domestic jugs - rituals only previously seen in female graves. Men would normally be buried with weapons, hammers and flint knives

Dig director Radek Baly - from the 
Czech Archaeological Society - said: ‘We have managed to unearth 
impressions of wooden supporting structures of so-called long houses, 
typical of the Neolithic period.’

The skeleton was originally discovered
 last year with a series of clues that led experts to believe the grave 
belonged to a gay man.

The
 skeleton of the late Stone Age man, unearthed during excavations in the
 Czech Republic, is said to date back to between 2900 and 2500 BC.

During that period, men were 
traditionally buried lying on their right side with the head pointing 
towards the west; women on their left side with the head facing east.

In
 this case, the man was on his left side with his head facing west. 
Another clue is that men tended to be interred with weapons, hammers and
 flint knives as well as several portions of food and drink to accompany
 them to the other side.

Women
 would be buried with necklaces made from teeth, pets, and copper 
earrings, as well as domestic jugs and an egg-shaped pot placed near the
 feet.

The ‘gay caveman’ was buried with household jugs, and no weapons.

Archaeologists
 do not think it was a mistake or coincidence given the importance 
attached to funerals during the period, known as the Corded Ware era 
because of the pottery it produced.

From
 history and ethnology, we know that people from this period took 
funeral rites very seriously so it is highly unlikely that this 
positioning was a mistake,’ said lead researcher Kamila Remisova 
Vesinova.

‘Far more 
likely is that he was a man with a different sexual orientation, 
homosexual or transvestite. What we see here does not add up to 
traditional Corded Ware cultural norms.’

An oval, egg-shaped container usually associated with female burials was also found at the feet of the skeleton.

Another member of the 
archaeological team, Katerina Semradova, said that colleagues had 
uncovered an earlier case dating from the Mesolithic period where a 
female warrior was buried as a man.

She
 added that Siberian shamans, or witch doctors, were also buried in this
 way but with richer funeral accessories appropriate to their elevated 
position in society.

‘This
 later discovery was neither of those. We believe this is one of the 
earliest cases of what could be described as a transvestite or 
third-gender grave in the Czech Republic.’

Neolithic community may have buried him separately as a gay man or possibly a transvestite
