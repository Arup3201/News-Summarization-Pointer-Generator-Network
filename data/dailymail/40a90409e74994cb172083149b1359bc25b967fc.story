Aqab Hussain was jailed for 20 years after running over a group of friends, including a father of three who is no longer able to talk or walk

A disqualified driver who bowled over three pedestrians in a revenge attack has been jailed for 20 years.

Aqab Hussain, 21, was already banned from the roads when he ploughed into a group of friends following a minor spat outside a club.

Shocking CCTV footage shows the attack, which during the trial was compared to a scene from the computer game Grant Theft Auto, taking place in Manchester city centre last August.

It shows one man knocked to the pavement, another catapulted over the roof of the Vauxhall Corsa and a third carried down the street before Hussain swerved to dislodge him from the bonnet.

Father-of-three Michael Ward, 29, who was thrown over the car roof, was left with catastrophic head injuries. He now cannot talk, feed himself or play any part in family life, Manchester Crown Court heard.

Mr Ward was already partially sighted and had to be helped to cross roads and get upstairs before he was injured in the incident.

Hussain denied being the driver but was found guilty by a jury of four counts of attempted murder after a trial last month and today given a 20-year jail term.

He had flouted court orders for previous convictions for dangerous driving and Hussain, himself a father of three, was serving a ban at the time of the offence.

Passing sentence Judge Robert Atherton said it was fortunate Mr Ward did not die in the attack.

‘He was very, very seriously injured. He will never recover, he will never be able to enjoy his family,’ the judge said.

‘One witness described the scene as being like someone bowling at skittles and people being flung like skittles to the side.

‘Why you did it is extremely difficult to understand.’

During the trial, eyewitness Corey Gordon, 26, who watched the attack from inside his car, later compared it to a sequence from the violent computer game series in which users play the role of car thieves.

He said: ‘It was like ten pin bowling where you hit the skittles and they go up in the air. I can only describe it as unreal - a computer game like Grand Theft Auto - as he swerved off line to hit the men. It knocked one of the men at least 7ft into the air.’

Hussain even wobbled his vehicle so he could shake off one of the men who was still on the bonnet, Manchester Crown Court was told.

Outside court, Mr Ward’s wife of seven years, Mary Rose Ward, said: ‘What he did to my husband, you wouldn’t do it to an animal really would you?

‘My husband was never a violent person and I am not a violent person but he should not have done what he did.’

Mrs Ward said her blind husband was still receiving full-time care in a rehabilitation centre but that she cares for him during the day before going home to look after their children, daughters Montana, six, and Crystal, aged four, and son Michael, aged one.

‘He can’t play with the kids or anything. He can’t talk, he can’t walk, he can’t wash himself or feed himself, he has no memory. I’m his wife and I will care for him for the rest of my life because he is my husband.

‘He knows he was in a car accident and I try and explain but he doesn’t really understand.’She said their six-year-old had asked her: ‘Why did they do it to my daddy?’ and that their other baby was only two months old when her husband was attacked.

‘I have to try and get on with my life. You’ve got to cope, don’t you, and take things day by day.

‘My husband will have to stick this for the rest of his life and he (Hussain) will be out in 20 years.’

Leaving: Hussain had previous convictions for dangerous driving and failing to stop after an accident

Mr Ward is still receiving full-time care more than a year on from the incident in Manchester city centre

The court heard the incident, on John Dalton Street in Manchester, started in ‘horseplay’ between Hussain, from Rusholme, Manchester, and his friends and the group with Mr Ward, from Bolton.

But it led to ‘fisticuffs’, with witnesses saying Hussain’s group coming off second best.

Minutes later Hussain jumped in the car and drove at the men in revenge.

Mr Ward was scooped up on the bonnet before being ‘deposited’ at the side of the road. He was in intensive care for 20 days and spent around four months in a high dependency unit.

Paul Hulme, 30, also suffered ‘significant injuries’ with multiple leg fractures after being carried on the bonnet before Hussain veered in the road to knock him off.

Aqab Hussain will be banned from driving for 15 years after he has served his 20 year sentence in prison

Martin Harris, 32, suffered bruises as he was side-swiped by the car while a fourth member of Mr Ward’s group, Thomas Mallanphy, narrowly escaped injury after stepping back from the road.Hussain fled to Pakistan after the incident but was arrested at Heathrow when he flew back to the UK six weeks later.

He had a string of motoring convictions starting from the age of 16.

Hussain was convicted of dangerous driving in October 2008 after making off from police when asked to stop while behind the wheel of a friend’s car.

Fourteen months later he was convicted of driving while disqualified and failing to stop after an accident after crashing into a lamppost and another car.

And a year later in November 2010, while still disqualified, he was convicted of dangerous driving for a second time and jailed for the first time with 12 months in a young offenders institute.

Paul O’Brien, defending, said the attempted murder offences were ‘out of character’ and occurred due to Hussain’s lack of maturity and his desire to show off to friends.

He said he came from a good family but had gone off the rails as a teenager.Hussain was also banned from driving for 15 years, which he will serve once he is released two-thirds of the way through his sentence, as is normal practice.

Mr Ward faces another major operation on December 21 to have metal plates fitted in his head.

Detective Chief Inspector Andy Peach, from Greater Manchester Police, said: ‘This incident started after a minor disagreement between the two groups of men. The CCTV footage demonstrates that Hussain thought he would finish the argument by purposefully using a car as a weapon and deliberately driving into Michael and his friends.

‘The CCTV footage gives an example of how fast he was driving the car and the impact it had with Mr Ward. In all my years of policing, I have not seen anything as shocking as this and I find it amazing that Michael and his friends are still alive.

‘The impact this has had on him and his family has been truly devastating. He is still receiving treatment and his wife visits him every day in hospital. Due to the injuries he suffered, he will no longer be able to play an active part in bringing up his young children. He will need care for the rest of his life.

‘Thanks to the information we received, we were able to arrest Hussain and bring him to justice.

‘However, no sentence can bring back the quality of life Michael once had, and he and his loved ones will have to live with the constant reminder of what happened in the early hours of that morning.’
