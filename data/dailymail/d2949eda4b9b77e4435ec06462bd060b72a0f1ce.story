The 12 days of Christmas has been extended to 100 days as the nation's favourite supermarket launches its festive season - in mid-September.

The first packets of mince pies, plum puddings, stollen and Santa shaped sweets and biscuits have been stacked on the country's most popular supermarket.

The shelves which just days before were stacked with uniforms, pens and pencils, and stationary for school children going back to school, have been swapped for festive goodies.

Ho ho no? The shelves in some Tesco supermarkets are being stocked with Christmas produce in September

Chocs away: These are the festive shelves at the Meadows Tesco, in Camberley, Surrey

Tesco is ranked as the country's top supermarket and it has unashamedly heralded that there was the '100 sleeps' until Christmas at the weekend.

The countdown features on the homepage of Tesco.com. As from today there are 'just' 98 sleeps to go!

The 'seasonal aisle' at The Meadows supermarket in Camberley, Surrey, features piles of mince pies, chocolate Santa's and boxes of Quality Street and Roses, all under the bright red and gold banners announcing the arrival of Christmas.

The range of festive produce was on the shelves even before spooky Hallowe'en treats and the sparkly delights of November 5th.

Too much too soon? These Santas are up for sale in the Camberley store

On Tuesday surprised shoppers took to Twitter to voice their irritation that that the supermarket had tried to force Christmas onto shoppers too soon.

Rachel Morath, from the Vale of Glamorgan, said: 'There's xmas stuff in Tesco already, £mental no wonder the nations fat when xmas starts in September!'

Matt Stockbridge of Chichester tweeted: 'Even I, the biggest fan of Xmas think Tesco have taken it too far by already making a Xmas aisle. Mince pies in September? £too far'

A spokesman for the supermarket giant said it were trying to 'spread the cost of the Christmas'.

The spokesman added that they only have a small range of products for the store cupboard and more would be added in the run up to December.

Feeling extra festive: The Meadows supermarket in Camberley, Surrey

Tesco is not alone in starting Christmas early.

Tenterden in Kent put up and turned on their Christmas lights 115 days before December 25.

The Christmas lights switch-on was 
announced online by town councillor Sue Ferguson, who posted a photo of 
the lights and said: ‘Tenterden Christmas lights going up!!’

It was a similar story in Cardiff, as shoppers were shocked to big red stockings and reindeer toys on sale at The Mamas & Papas store in Cardiff this August.

A bit early, perhaps? Christmas lights are already blazing in Tenterden, Kent, four months before the big day
