A former professional Grand Prix 
motorcyclist whose young wife plunged to her death from a hotel room has been stranded in Dubai for six months because police won't return his passport - even though they have finished their investigation

Abbie Emmett, 27, of Addlestone in Surrey, died just days 
after she had arrived in the United Arab Emirates with new husband Sean,
43, on honeymoon following their wedding in South Africa.

Mr Emmett, a 19 times British Superbike race winner, was questioned by officers after Abbie fall 50ft after leaning from the balcony to look for her 
dropped wedding ring.

Sean Emmett said new wife Abbie, 27, fell 50ft to her death after she 
leaned over the balcony to look for her wedding ring after she dropped 
it. He said she had been drinking and was emotional before her tragic 
fall

However, he is stranded in the city because they will not return the document, even though the investigation has been concluded.

Mr Emmett, who has three children 
from a previous marriage - Tiffany, 19, Brittany, 15, and 14-year-old 
Freddie, said that police have said there were no suspicious 
circumstances and he could not understand why he was not allowed to 
leave Dubai.

He has not spoken out previously because he wanted to respect the legal process, but frustration has driven him to speak out.

He told The Independent: 'Enough is enough. I'm effectively locked in the world's biggest prison and I can't go on.

'I just can't understand what they are investigating. I'd be happy even if they deported me because I'll never come back here.'

The couple had been staying at the luxury Jumeirah Creekside Hotel in Dubai on their honeymoon, when Mrs Emmett fell to her death

He is staying with an expat while he faces the twin horrors of being in limbo and mourning his wife. He could not even attend his wife's cremation in the UK.

Neither the police or justice officials in Dubai were available for comment.

A
Foreign Office spokeswoman said: 'We are providing consular assistance 
at this difficult time to the individual concerned and family.

'We
cannot interfere in the judicial process of another country, and must 
respect their systems just as we expect them to respect the UK's laws 
and legal processes.'

Mr Emmett said that she had been standing on tiptoe over the rail when she plummeted from the fourth storey window.

Professional racer Mr Emmett, pictured at a British Superbikes race in 2004, said his passport has been taken from him and he cannot leave Dubai

'I told her not to lean because it was dangerous,' he told The Sun newspaper. in May.

'The next minute, I saw her legs and feet and she was gone. She just flipped straight out.'

The new Mrs Emmett, a vicar's 
daughter, had only been at the luxury Jumeirah Creekside Hotel for two 
nights when she toppled from the balcony in February.

Mr Emmett said that, 
following a night out, Abbie had been drinking in their hotel room when 
she dropped her new wedding ring.

He claimed she had been emotional 
because she had been drinking and was upset that the pair were due to 
return home to Addlestone, Surrey.

Mr Emmett said that after his bride's
tragic fall he had ran downstairs and found her limp and lifeless body 
on the ground beneath the balcony.

He said he performed CPR until paramedics reached the scene.

He was then questioned by police, and said that officers only told him that Mrs Emmet had the following day.

Mr Emmett had previously told the newspaper that he spent four days in a prison cell after he was arrested on February 28.

He was accused of smelling of alcohol
when he went to sign police papers to organise the release of her body,
and was fined for drinking in the strict Muslim state without a 
licence.

Drinking alcohol in Dubai is illegal without a specific licence.

Reports
at the time quoted local police as saying that forensic tests had 
revealed she had been drinking but they said there were no suspicious 
circumstances and the case was recorded as a suicide.

The couple shared a flat in Addlestone, where Mr Emmett runs a bike taxi service.
