These breath-taking pictures show a playful humpback whale leaping from the sea to show off to a group of tourists on a nearby boat.

The humpback appears to wave one of its fins and leaps from the Pacific Ocean, almost clattering into a low-flying bird which gets the shock of its life as the giant creature emerges a few feet below.

German photographer Mario Nonaka was amazed when the whale suddenly launched from the water and raised its fin in his direction.

Whale hello there: The humpback whale was pictured leaping from the water, almost clattering into a low-flying bird as it waved its fin towards a boat

Whale of a time: The humpback splashed around in front of photographer Mario Nonaka in Monterey Bay, California

The 36-year-old was on a boat trip around Monterey Bay, California, when he saw the humpback majestically throwing itself out of the sea.

The whale breached more than three times as it entertained the photographer and tourists on the boat.

Mr Nonaka said: 'It was absolutely amazing to personally watch something so spectacular.

'When it flicked up its right flipper it appeared to be waving at everyone on the boat. 

'It seemed almost effortless for such a big animal to get so high out of the water.

'I've been on about 10 trips around Monterey Bay and never seen anything like this. In the late summer months you are almost guaranteed of seeing breaching whales but this was something else.'

Humpback whales are often seen in Monterey Bay in the late Summer months, where gray and killer whales can also be found 

Humpbacks are often seen in Monterey Bay in the late Summer months, where gray whales can also be found.

The humpbacks live in the bay between April and December, feeding on schooling fishes and krill.

They often use a 'bubble net' to catch their prey, blowing bubbles that surround the school so it cannot escape before swooping through with their mouths wide open.

Killer whales often lurk just outside of the bay, hoping to catch the gray whales when they migrate north. 

The acrobatic humpbacks can grow up to 50ft long, and have a reputation for throwing themselves out of the water despite weighing up to 40 tons.

They were almost hunted to extinction during the 1960s, but a ban has allowed their global population to reach approximately 80,000. 

The whales are also known for the songs they sing when looking for a mate, which can last for up to 20 minutes and can be heard 18 miles away.
