The intricate designs and amazing detailed fondant work in these cakes are a sight to behold. They are the creations of budding bakers, who cooked up these complicated cakes for a competition.

Their creations included characters from the television show The Simpsons, a tiger covered in flowers and a deer drinking from a lake.

The Threadcakes competition, a rival to BBC's Great British Bake Off, asked bakers around the world to create sponge-based treats inspired by Threadless's printed t-shirts.

Canadian baker Kylie Mangles' Cutout Ralph took first  in the 3D category of the Threadcakes competition. The 29-year-old spent five days working around the clock to bake the ribs and bones, and to decorate the cartoon character with fondant

Watering a Life into Itself won fifth place in the 3D category. It shows a deer drinking from a lake with trees made made out of edible wafer paper, leaves dyed with food colouring and branches made out of baker's gum paste

Good enough to eat: This multicoloured tiger, Tropicalia, was the creation of  Elizabeth Marek and took second place in the 3D category

The winning 3D cake, made by 29-year-old Kylie Mangles, was based on a cut-out version of the Simpson's character Ralph.

The cake and cookie designer from Canada won $1,000 (£640)  in cash and Threadless gift certificates for her intricate design.

Fantasy Space cake won the  2D category in the Threadcakes competition. Designer Megan Matsumoto took three weeks to complete her entry 

Fifth place winner in the 2D category went to  Natasha Baker who created A Pixel of My Childhood and shows video game consoles

The Red Deer by Melissa Cody won second place in the 2D category. The animal and surrounding scenery was carefully crafted in fondant

Ms Mangles spent five days working around the clock to bake the ribs and bones and decorate the cartoon character with fondant.

Winner of the 2D category Megan Matsumoto, 22 from California, said of her design 'Fantasy Space': 'Sculpting and painting all the gumpaste and fondant pieces took about three weeks or so, but only because I was so busy and could only work on them a little bit here and there.

'When all the pieces were done, I baked and finished the cake in one day.'

Other standouts include a deer with foliage sprouting from its back, which was made in thirty hours over three days, and a cat wearing goggles which took a week to assemble and included buttercream for the fur. 

Chris Cardinal, from Threadless, said: 'A panel of judges reviews each cake and picks their ten favorites in the 2D and 3D categories and submits them to me. Their ballots are tallied and the winners are selected.

'This year's best entries had a lot of complexity and really accurate execution of the original design.'

Threadless is an online community of artists, based in Chicago, Illinois. The company was founded in 2000 and products on sale - created and chosen by web users - include original artwork, graphic t-shirts and mobile phone accessories. 

Fourth place went to The Flaming Lips by Yasmeen Daultana. The monochrome cake has subtle raised designs and a distinct Gothic feel
