The Liberian footballer hailed as an inspiration and true patriot has died, penniless, homeless, suffering from a long battle with drugs and alcoholism.

George Sacko - known as the Wizard - had entranced his country with his football skills and captaincy. But despite his illustrious career the footballing great, 75, died in a New Jersey hospital on September 17 almost anonymously.

Friends and family were not aware of his death for nearly a month afterwards, as the shelter where he was staying did not have accurate records of his stay.

A sad end: George Sacko, aka 'Wizard' has passed away in Newark

The midfielder learned to play the game kicking footballs barefoot in Monrovia, Liberia's capital, before serving as captain for Lone Star, the country's national team in the 1960s.

Mr Sacko, one of seven children, was hailed as the 'glue' in the team and attracted a diverse audience different ethnic groups and political persuasions, news website NJ.com reported.

'Sacko was very, very important to our
 national pride, because he brought us together,' Benedict Wisseh, another Lone Star player, told the website.

'He made us forget our differences.'

In his playing career Liberia never qualified for the World Cup, but as captain he led the team to its first victory, a 2-0 result over the Ivory Coast in 1960.

Yet a debilitating knee injury in 1962 dashed his glittering career and his skills would never be the same afterwards.

He received an offer from the New York Generals in 1968, but the deal never went through as the team folded shortly after Mr Sacko's arrival.

In 1971, Mr Sacko moved to Brooklyn permanently to live with his brothers.

The Wizard: Sacko was an inspirational football captain

His wife June had already been living in the New York borough for several months with their two sons and June’s daughter.

She said that even during his heyday as a famous football player, Mr Sacko remained grounded.

‘He was very calm, thoughtful,’ she told NJ.com. He held a good job at a custom metals company in Harrison, New Jersey, which allowed the family to live comfortably.

She said that while he always remained a devoted father, ‘the love went away for me.’

She eventually moved back to New York while Mr Sacko stayed in New Jersey, continuing his job at the metals plant until it closed its doors permanently in the 1980s.

After that, Mr Sacko began a downward spiral, drinking in excess and using heroin, his brother Garretson told NJ.com.

After a fire forced him out of a friend’s apartment, he began living in a cramped, dingy room subsidised by public assistance.

He was forced out of the Carlton Hotel after he refused to meet with authorities and in the end, spent his time wandering around Newark’s streets.

He spent his nights sleeping at Newark Penn Station - about eight miles outside of New York City.

His family encouraged him to come back to Rhode Island where they now lived, but he refused. Family and friends weren’t aware of his passing for nearly a month.

'Something happened in my brother's life. He just didn't care anymore. He was not crazy, but he gave up on life.'

According to the death certificate, the once-brilliant footballer died of natural causes. His lungs were acutely diseased, it said.

It also indicated that his upper gastrointestinal tract had started to bleed about a month before his death.

In May of this year, the Liberian community honoured the former football player’s 75th birthday at a local Newark restaurant.

Last public event: The Liberian government held a luncheon for the 75-year-old player last May. The event flier said Mr Sacko was in good health

While the flier for the occasion boasted that Mr Sacko was ‘in excellent health,’ his brother Garretson said that his brother told him that day that he was sick. ‘Pray for me,’ he said.

In September, Mr Sacko made $50 by helping move furniture. It was that money, his brother said, that funded his final purchase - a fatal dose of heroin.

‘He just didn’t care anymore,’ Garretson told the website. ‘He was not crazy, but he gave up on life.’
