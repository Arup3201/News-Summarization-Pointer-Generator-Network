Mali the elephant has more reason than most to feel lonely as she is the only member of her species living in the Philippines.

And now campaigners have stepped up their efforts to have her moved from her current home in Manila Zoo to Thailand so that she can enjoy some well-earned company with a herd of other elephants.

The singer Morrissey and the French former film star Brigette Bardot are among a host of celebrities to back a campaign by the Pilipinas Ecowarriors, an 
environmental group, to get Mali relocated.Â

Lonely: Mali - the only elephant in the Philippines - currently lives alone in Manila Zoo

Much-loved: She is a popular attraction for animal lovers at the zoo - but campaigners say she should be with other elephants

They are calling for her to be sent to the Thai 
Elephant Conservation Centre in Lampang province, where she would live with an herd of 
about 50 elephants in a forest setting.

Efforts to 'deport' Mali have increased in recent weeks as more groups have joined the campaign, including People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). Mali came to the Philippines in 1977 as a gift to then-president Ferdinand Marcos by Sri Lanka.

The campaign has also been supported by former pop star star Yusuf Islam - formerly known as Cat Stevens - who issued a 
statement to PETA Asia in support of Mali's transfer.

He said: 'I hope the Zoo in Manila will do the right 
thing and let Mali free to enjoy her last years on Earth in the company 
of other elephants.'

Philippine President Benigno Aquino personally entered the debate this year. He issued orders to the Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau and the Department of Agriculture's Bureau of Animal Industry to see if Mali could travel.

'After receiving a letter from famed musician Morrissey, Philippines President Benigno Aquino III issued a directive stating that Mali's health should be evaluated and she should be considered for transfer to a sanctuary.

Following this directive, PETA Asia flew in elephant expert Dr Henry Melvyn Richardson to examine Mali who was found to have developed foot problems due to having been kept in a concrete enclosure.
