Brazil supporters allegedly set off fireworks outside the Colombia team hotel at 4am on the night before their crucial World Cup quarter-final clash.

This is just the latest example of the dark arts which the Brazilians plan to employ as they bid to win their sixth World Cup on home soil.

Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari’s declaration - or was it a warning - that his team were no longer going to be the World Cup’s Mr Nice Guys reveals a great deal about the psychological state of the Seleção as their crunch quarter-final tie with Colombia looms.

Scolari 
has done everything possible to shield his inexperienced squad - only 
six of whom have previously played at the World Cup finals - from the 
combined weight of the hopes and desires of 200million football mad 
local fans, and the country’s glorious World Cup-winning heritage.

But
 a string of underwhelming performances, including near-elimination 
against Chile last Saturday, have pushed Scolari and his team close to 
breaking point - and closer to paranoia.

'We’re being true gentlemen, and extremely polite, with the foreigners. It’s time to change our approach a little…we will no longer be the target of attacks from coaches, players and the foreign press,' Scolari growled after the game.

He was referring to some violent Chilean challenges, notably from Arturo Vidal, including one that left Neymar nursing a dead leg in the days after the game. 

Brazil’s technical director Carlos Alberto Parreira, meanwhile, enraged by a number of controversial decisions by English referee Howard Webb, was seeing enemies everywhere.

'If 
there’s a conspiracy… then it’s against Brazil, and not in our favour. 
The idea that we might win the hexa (a sixth world title) is bothering 
someone. And it’s only going to get worse as the tournament goes on,' he
 muttered darkly on Saturday night. Scolari later echoed Parreira’s 
thoughts in a private meeting with Brazilian journalists during the 
week.

Brazil,
 however, have not shown a great deal of stomach for the fight in this 
World Cup, at times looking more like Roland Browning than Gripper 
Stebson.

Thiago Silva was in tears before the opening game against Croatia, Neymar cried during the anthem before the Mexico match, and Julio Cesar had a weepy moment both before and after the penalty shoot-out against Chile. Then, after the same game, Silva revealed that he had asked 'God and Felipão' if he could be spared the ordeal of taking a penalty.

If push literally does come to shove, will Brazil be able to show their mean side?

Possibly, although none of this team has a particularly strong reputation as a Nigel de Jong or Jermaine Jones type enforcer. Luiz Gustavo, the team’s best tackler, is suspended for the Colombia game, and Thiago Silva leads through example rather than chest-beating. 

On the other hand, a number of Brazilians - including Ramires, Fernandinho, Dani Alves, Hulk and David Luiz have appeared near the top of the Champions League most fouls committed table in recent years.

Luiz made negative headlines for over the top challenges on both Stoke’s Jonathan Walters and FC Basel’s Philipp Degen while playing for Chelsea, but the Brazil player with the worst reputation for on-field violence is undoubtedly full-back Marcelo.

After the Real Madrid defender’s two-footed lunge on Thomas Muller at the end of the 2012 Champions League semi-final first leg, the Bayern player said 'he was out to get me,' while a reckless scissor tackle on Cesc Fabregas in the 2011 Spanish Super Cup final against Barcelona sparked a mass brawl.  

Then there is Neymar. Judging by the elbow that landed in the face of Luka Modric during Brazil’s opening game against Croatia, the youngster on whom Brazil’s World Cup hopes rest has clearly not lost the talent for winding-up opponents that he enjoyed in his youth.

After the Barcelona star swore at his teammates and coach during a game for Santos in 2010, experienced Brazilian manager René Simões said that Brazilian football 'was creating a monster'.

That was a long time ago, and Neymar can perhaps be forgiven the impetuousness of youth. But South American football has a long tradition of upholding the darker arts of the game, particularly in the Copa Libertadores, the continent’s Champions League, where grounds are often small and cramped, and pitches in poor quality.

'When you play in the Copa Libertadores, if you go to Paraguay, Argentina and Ecuador, as you approach the stadium you get attacked from all sides with stones, sticks and posts,' said Fernandinho last year.
