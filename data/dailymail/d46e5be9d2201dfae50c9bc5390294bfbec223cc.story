Last month’s Bafta TV awards saw Judi Dench and Helen Mirren take a back seat as another name stepped into the limelight.

After years of High Street obscurity, the department store House of Fraser staged an almost complete red-carpet takeover.

Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Amber le Bon, Susanna Reid and Kate Garraway, among others, all wore beautiful swishing floor-length bejewelled gowns sold by the store. It was a fashion coup that, overnight, propelled House of Fraser back into middle-class consciousness.

Since then sales of Biba evening wear, worn by Susanna Reid and Kate Garraway on the night, have more than doubled. But it’s simplistic to say the forgotten department store’s success is down to one night of headlines.

In fact, House of Fraser has been quietly creeping up on its competitors for some time. It announced record sales of £1.2 billion in 2013, which were up £30 million on the year before. It’s a figure that’s a long way from the £4.4 million losses it suffered in 2005.

So why is the chain succeeding where its competitors, including Debenhams and Marks & Spencer, are facing difficulties?

Stylist Annabel Kerman thinks part of the reason is that it offers a vast array of sophisticated labels compared with other department stores, Marks & Spencer and Debenhams in particular. Indeed, the number of womenswear brands across House of Fraser stores and online is 500 and counting.

More importantly, Kerman thinks House of Fraser’s unique labels give sales a big boost. ‘It has a vast number of different designers that you can’t get anywhere else on the High Street such as Biba, Pied A Terre and Mary Portas.’

It’s here that House  of Fraser has changed  tack dramatically, with  such success.

Where it used to sell a multitude of concessions such as Warehouse, Principles, Oasis and Nine West — brands that often had a stand-alone store just a few doors down the High Street — now it’s chosen to favour in-house labels and exciting new designers not seen elsewhere.

And it is finally listening to the customer. Since 2011, the store has been cleverly analysing the feedback it receives from customers, both online and in store.

It has encouraged House of Fraser to introduce next-evening deliveries everywhere and same-day deliveries within the M25, click-and-collect ordering services, as well as computers that allow you to order from within the store.

Another reason for the turn of fortune is down to Stephanie Chen, who joined the company in 2009, heading up the womenswear department. In a previous role at Debenhams, she helped to create the phenomenally  successful Designers at Debenhams range.

Stephanie introduced the new Biba and Mary Portas ranges at House of Fraser before restructuring the womenswear department. She left for Marks & Spencer in 2012, and has been tackling their resurgence since.  

The foundations laid at House of Fraser are still in place — and have been built on with a carefully calibrated move upmarket that hasn’t sacrificed affordability.

As well as many £250-plus evening gowns, there are cocktail numbers for well below £100, such as Warehouse’s £60 twist-back maxi dress, or Untold’s chic blue satin dress at £85. Not super-cheap, but very reasonable for occasionwear.

‘People feel that a lot of the brands at House of Fraser are a little bit of a treat because they’re more than they’d normally spend, but they’re not totally out of their price range,’ says Kerman.

However, the company’s journey from forgotten High Street monolith to desirable destination has not been a smooth one.

Established in 1864 as a cloth merchant in Glasgow, House of Fraser was owned by Hugh Fraser and James Arthur.

From the Thirties, the Fraser family drove expansion and began to buy up the competition, acquiring more than 50 new stores in the Seventies alone.

And while some shops retained their local identity — Edinburgh’s venerable Jenners, for example — most lost their names, rejected in favour of House of Fraser, a result of the branding juggernaut that made the High Streets of the past 20 years so monotonous.

Many of those House of Fraser-owned stores have closed in the past two decades to streamline the business, but the move has turned much-loved local landmarks into empty, crumbling buildings.

That move may have kept the company in business, but for many shoppers, goodwill was thrown away.

Happily for House of Fraser, public opinion seems to have turned again, aided by recent celebrity endorsements on the red carpet. ‘People really like to see celebrities wearing a High Street dress and making it look designer. I think celebrities are definitely changing their attitudes to trying the High Street,’ says Kerman.

If she’s right, House of Fraser might just be on to a winning formula.
