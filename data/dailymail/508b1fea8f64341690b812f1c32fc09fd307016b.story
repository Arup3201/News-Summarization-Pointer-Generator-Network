The hunt for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane took an extraordinary twist last night when China said it may have detected a signal from its black box recorder on the floor of the Indian Ocean.

The faint signal was picked up by a Chinese search vessel on the twenty-ninth day of the hunt for Flight MH370, just hours before  the recorder’s batteries were expected to die.

China’s state-run news agency said the search vessel Haixun 01 picked up the signal on the precise frequency used by black box recorders in a search zone hundreds of miles off the west coast of Australia.

The signal was detected using a black 
box detector – a remote- controlled missile-shaped submersible – at 
around 25 degrees south latitude and 101 degrees east longitude, 
according to a Chinese journalist on board the ship.

The
 signal was picked up for only 90 seconds, suggesting, remarkably, that 
if it did come from the plane’s black box recorder it may have been the 
final output before the battery died at the end of its 30-day life.

Later,
 the Xinhua news agency said a Chinese airforce plane had spotted 
‘several white objects’ floating on the surface of the ocean 1,680 miles
 from Perth at 11.05am yesterday. The debris was just 55 miles from the 
area where the ping  was detected.

A
 huge underwater search was expected to be launched at daylight to see 
if the ship has found the  Boeing 777, which disappeared less than an 
hour into a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8 with 239 
passengers and crew on board.

Britain’s
 HMS Echo – carrying sophisticated equipment that can hear the 
recorder’s pings – has joined the hunt and robot submersibles from an 
Australian search team are expected to be sent down where the ocean is 
up to two miles deep. An 11-strong international flotilla is searching a
 vast area of the southern Indian Ocean for the plane.

To
 hear the black box signals the Chinese ship would have needed to be 
almost directly above the shoebox-sized black box, which was housed in 
the plane’s tail section.

The
 discovery would be unprecedented as black box recorders have only ever 
been found after a field of debris was detected first.

The potential discovery came as Malaysia vowed it would not give up on trying to find the missing jetliner and announced details of a multinational investigation team to solve the aviation mystery, as the search for the plane entered its fifth week

Malaysia
 and Australia, which is in charge of the Indian Ocean search, greeted 
the news with cautious  optimism last night but advised  people to wait 
for developments, anxious that it could turn out to be another false 
lead.

In the first week 
after the plane disappeared, China announced through Xinhua that it had 
satellite images of what might be debris from the missing flight in the 
South China Sea, only to claim later the data had been put out in error.

China
 informed Australian officials about the black box signals at lunchtime 
on Saturday before breaking ranks to announce the  discovery shortly 
after Malaysian officials told journalists at a daily briefing that 
there had been no new developments in the search.

Teams are searching for two black boxes like this one which investigators hope will reveal what happened on board the doomed flight

A
 government source in Kuala Lumpur said: ‘We sincerely hope the black 
box recorder has been found but our main concern is for the relatives of
 those missing, and we feel the way the Chinese government has announced
 this is not appropriate. It smacks of one-upmanship.’

Chinese nationals
 account for 157 of the passengers on the plane.

If
 debris or the black box cannot be found, the only hope for finding the 
plane may be a full survey of the Indian Ocean floor, an operation that 
would take years.
