An IT expert has been left in a web of fear after a massive spider has moved into his home.

Darren Driscoll, 43, from Plymouth, Devon, filmed his encounter with the eight-legged fiend after spotting a funnel-shaped cobweb outside his house.

He used a stick to poke it but as he did a large, green-fanged spider came charging out of its nest.

The spider has made a nest at Darren Driscoll's home in Plymouth, Devon, leaving his family terrified. The IT worker believes it is a tube-web spider and says it's doubled in size since he first noticed it in August

The father-of-three says the spider has doubled in size since he first noticed it in August and fears the colder weather could make his home a welcome invite for the arachnid.

Mr Driscoll believes the spider is a segstria fiorentina – more commonly known as the tube-web spider.

The spiders sow distinctive tube-shaped webs in cracks and holes and wait by the entrance for prey to touch the strands.

They first entered the UK 150 years ago from continental Europe, arriving on ships docking in ports such as Plymouth.

Their bites are non-fatal but can cause a sharp injection-like pain lasting for hours.

Although the spiders are still an unusual sight, experts warn the long, hot summer is helping them thrive.

The spider can be seen darting out the hole checking for prey after Mr Driscoll poked it with a stick 

Mr Driscoll said: ‘By the look of it I would say it had more than doubled in size from when I first saw it two months ago.

‘I decided to tease it out so I got a piece of grass and poked the outside of its web.

‘It instantly charged out to grab the piece of grass. It is a really aggressive little thing, no fear at all.’

Tube-web spiders (Segestria florentina) is the largest European spider found and the bodies of females can reach lengths of 22mm.

Originally from the Mediterranean, they can be found as far east as Georgia but are also commonly spotted in Britain - particularly in the later half of the year.

They have a black or dark brown body, often with a green shine on their fangs. While their bite has no long lasting effects, it is described as feeling similar to a bee sting or injection and the pain can last for several hours.

They are also known as a tube web spider or cellar spider because they create a web in a crack or gap and wait for prey to step into it.

Sightings of the spider in Britain have in the past been confused with the deadly Australian funnel web spider as the two species use a similar hunting technique.

He added: ‘I think it is a tube-web spider, and I was surprised to hear it has such a painful bite, like being stabbed with a nail.

‘It’s something I’d like to avoid, let’s put it that way.’

Mr Driscoll, who is married but is separated from his wife, continued: ‘I’m not worried about getting bitten right now as it’s quite out the way. But if it heads inside for the winter then I might be in trouble.’

Tube-web spiders are one of the largest spiders in Europe and are nocturnal hunters that prey on cockroaches, moths, bees and wasps.

The females tend to be larger than males and can reach a body length of up to 22mm.

Kelvin Boot, a naturalist and former BBC radio presenter, said the tube web-spider might look scary but says it’s not dangerous to humans.

He said: ‘It bites in defence so if you pick one up, or it gets caught in your clothing, you are likely to be nipped. But no British spider delivers a fatal bite or even one dangerous to humans.

‘It seems this spider was accidentally introduced into UK from its native Mediterranean and North Africa.

‘It sits at the mouth of its tunnel in old brickwork or behind loose bark or any other suitable hole, waiting for a hapless insect to stumble across the spokes - tripwires that alert the spider to its victim.

‘Once detected, the spider moves like lightning. I defy anybody not to jump when this happens as it is such a surprise even if you are expecting it.

‘The prey is dragged back into the narrow tube and eventually the spider’s venom overcomes the prey.’

A tube-web spider, which was spotted last week in Southampton, are believed to be the biggest in Europe
