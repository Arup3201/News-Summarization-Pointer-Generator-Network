Five deputies with the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office in Ohio are under investigation for allegedly sending racist text messages.

Two officers, Capt. Thomas Flanders and Detective Michael Sollenberger, have been placed on paid administrative leave while the other three – who are as yet unnamed – remain on the job while the investigation continues.

The accusations came to light after an anonymous source passed on hundreds of pages of the messages to the Dayton Unit of the NAACP.

The texts, which contain a barrage of racist slurs and insensitive jokes aimed at African-Americans, were exchanged between November 2011 and January 2013 on personal cell phones

After conducted a three-month-long investigation to ensure their authenticity, Derrick Forward - the civil rights organization’s local president - turned the messages over to Sheriff Phil Plumber last week.

The texts were exchanged between November 2011 and January 2013 on personal cell phones between the employees during working hours.

They contain a barrage of racist slurs and insensitive jokes aimed at African-Americans.

One text said, 'I hate N******. That is all.'

One  deputy 'joked' to another: 'What do apples and black people have in common? They both hang from trees.'

Another read: 'We stopped at a Walmart in Birmingham, there are a lot of Black people in Alabama. It's all Martin Luther Kings fault.'

Derrick Forward, the president of the Dayton Unit of the NAACP, was handed records of the texts by an anonymous source and he forwarded them to Sheriff Phil Plumber last week

'These text messages, while some of them may be some joking going on back and forth, some of them are flat out rude and racist,' Foward told WBTN.

He wants the deputies to be sacked immediately if the sheriff’s investigation finds that they sent the messages.

Sheriff Plumber said the deputies had 'tarnished the office' by sending the text messages.

'These five individuals have taken this organization three steps backward and will be held accountable,' he said. 'I will not tolerate racism in this department.'

Plummer said his investigation is in its early stages, but it was important to public safety that both Flanders and Sollenberger be put on leave.

Two African-American deputies were mentioned in the texts, he said.

The deputies were in shock they were caught, 'but did not apologize,' Plummer said.

The two suspended officers have both been recently promoted.  

Flanders was a sergeant at the time of the text messages and Sollenberger was a detective under Flanders’ supervision.

Flanders had most recently been working as a jail administrator and Sollenberger in Internal Affairs.  

Captain Tom Flanders, who has been with the office for 19 years, told 2 NEWS that the allegations are completely false. 

He denied being racist and said he looked forward to clearing his name. 

The NAACP is requesting that an outside agency perform an investigation also.

The NAACP has called for an outside agency to perform an investigation and for the deputies to be sacked immediately if they are found responsible
