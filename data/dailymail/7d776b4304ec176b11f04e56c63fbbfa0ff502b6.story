FIFA has denied claims by Diego Maradona that officials preventing him attending Argentina's opening match of the World Cup in the Maracana.

The former Argentina player and manager, who is a fierce critic of FIFA, said he was forced to watch the match against Bosnia and Herzegovina on television in his hotel room.

But FIFA's head of media Delia Fischer said there had been no report to them of any incident involving Maradona, who is accredited to cover the tournament for Venezuelan TV.

She said: 'He is accredited as a journalist but we have not received any report on this. As long as he is going into the correct media area there should not be an issue.

'Maybe he tried to go somewhere where he didn't have the necessary access but we have no record of that happening.'

Maradona has previously called FIFA's hold over World Cup host countries as 'ugly'.

He told the Argentinian channel TyC Sports: 'I was not allowed to go in to the game. So I had to return to the hotel to see the second half.

'I did everything I could but they would not let us in.

'Someone just said no, it could not happen, so I had to watch it on TV. Hopefully we will get this resolved because I want to go and see Argentina in several more games.

'It is one thing to not be able to go to a game, and another to not be allowed to go.

'When there is goodwill, you're allowed in but when there is ill will, it's better to forget it and head back to the hotel, which is what we did.'
