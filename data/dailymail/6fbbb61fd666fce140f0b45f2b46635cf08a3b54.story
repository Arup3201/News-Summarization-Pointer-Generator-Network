Moped thieves have been jailed after footage from a cyclist's helmet camera showed them robbing an unsuspecting pedestrian.

Courtney Morgan, 19, Walid Hnida, 18, and Michael Ahmed, 20, have all been locked up for their part in a spate of 46 offences in south London last year over just 11 days.

Footage from a cycle camera shows Morgan, riding pillion, as he takes a mobile phone from a shocked woman outside Lambeth College in Clapham.

The gang used a stolen scooter to commit the spate of offences over an 11-day period last summer, during which they targeted a series of women, including one who was heavily pregnant.

They operated across Wandsworth, Lambeth, Richmond upon Thames and Hammersmith and Fulham in south and west London.

One woman was punched in the face and another was dragged along the pavement as she tried to keep hold of her phone which was eventually stolen.

Another woman was pulled onto the hot exhaust of the bike and her leg was so badly burnt she needed hospital treatment.

The gang were sentenced at Kingston Crown Court this week after admitting conspiracy to steal at a previous hearing.

Courtney Morgan was jailed for two years, Walid Hnida got three years and four months and Michael Ahmed was sentenced to four years and eight months.

Another member of the gang, 16-year-old Deandre Riley-Reid received a Youth Rehabilitation Order for his part in the offences.

A fifth gang member, 17-year-old Jerome Ashley Williams, will be sentenced later this month at the same court.

Detective 
Superintendent Penny Banham said: 'In total, Wandsworth CID solved 58 
individual offences of street robbery linked solely to this criminal 
network whose crime spree came to a complete halt following a 
phenomenally fast and detailed investigation.

'The value of the handsets stolen from across the four London boroughs stands at Â£120,000.

Detective Inspector Mark Blackshaw, from Wandsworth CID, added: 'This was an organised group of criminals who targeted commuters and innocent members of the public who were going about their ordinary business.

'It became evident that the violence being used began to escalate throughout the series, including mopeds being ridden indiscriminately along busy pavements and victims being punched in the face for their mobile phones.

'I am in no doubt that had these offenders not been caught quickly, more serious injuries to the public would have been sustained.'
