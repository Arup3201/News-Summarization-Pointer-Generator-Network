Chatting on mobile phones while dressed in traditional ceremonial garb, these young Japanese women embody a country of contrasts.

The giggling girls - who all turn 20 this year and officially enter adulthood - were attending a Coming of Age event at Disneyland Tokyo.

In exquisite scenes last week, snow fell in giant flakes as young ladies processed together in beautiful kimonos at theme parks and sparkling venues across Japan.

Blossoming into adulthood: The girls laugh, chatter and text excitedly as they celebrate turning 20 at the colourful event

Picture perfect: The young women trudge through heavy snow in traditional costume - but their smiles stay in place

Exotic birds: Two young women stand out from fellow train passengers in their vibrant outfits as they make their way home

Big day: The girls spend hours in hair and beauty salons  preparing for the ceremony - an extravagant event second only to a wedding

Blend is beautiful: A young woman in a rainbow-bright outfit stands talking on her phone in front of a line of vending machines - a symbol of Japan today

Not your average commuters: The girls look unselfconscious as they travel home on typical modes of transport after the celebration, attended by 1,200 young people

Red letter day: This girl goes for a different look with a scarlet parasol, defying the trend for delicate white umbrellas

Perfect poise: A soft and wistful look is more tradition for the day, honoured by Japanese people across the country

Goodbye to childhood things: The cheerful 20-year-olds celebrated on stage with their favourite Disney characters

Handbags and gladrags: While some went to Disneyland, others celebrated their special day at Toshimaen Amusement Park in Tokyo

Our turn now: The ancient event used to differ for boys and girls and take place when they were younger but it has existed in its present form since the 1940s

Flurry of activity: The young ladies wrap their kimonos round them and tread carefully, embroidered bags jostling with leather handbags on their arms

Moving through the seasons: The 20-year-olds process through the snow at Disneyland Tokyo as they attend the formal Coming of Age ceremony

Modern and traditional: The young women wear expensive Furisode kimonos and traditional socks and sandals for the historical ceremony - but today's Tokyoites cannot do without their mobile phones

New responsibilities: The event marks a transition into adulthood. After 20, young people can vote, buy alcohol or tobacco and be tried as adults in court

Flower power: The girls look gorgeous in their painstakingly made pink, orange and blue ensembles

Back in time: Trees tower over the revellers at Toshimaen Amusement Park as snow blankets Tokyo, bringing much of the local transport to a halt

Stopping traffic: Flights to and from the capital's Haneda airport were cancelled last week, parts of the expressways temporarily closed and local train services were delayed thanks to the swirling snow

A Furisode, named for its long swinging sleeves, is a formal kimono for unmarried women. The longer the sleeve, the higher the status. Brides wear them on their wedding day. It is usually made from Rinzu (silk) or Chirimen (crepe) in an 'Eba' design: meaning the pattern is spread over panels like a painting.

It is worn with an Obi - a colourful sash tied in a large bow at the back. Stiffeners and ribbons add shape and decoration. A fine, formal obi might cost more than the kimono itself.

A hip- or thigh-length kimono-like jacket called a Haori can be worn on top to add formality.

A robe called a Nagajuban,
worn beneath the outer kimono, keeping the delicate fabric clean 
by preventing contact with the wearer's skin. Only the collar edge 
shows.

A thin half-slip-like piece of underwear called a Susoyoke is worn under the nagajuban.

A narrow sash (Karihimo), often made 
of silk or wool, can hold virtually anything in place. A karihimo worn
around the hips to create the extra fold or ohashori in a woman's 
kimono is called Koshihimo, literally 'hip ribbon'.

On their feet, the girls wear Tabi, ankle socks with a separation between the big toe and other toes.

These are worn with Geta, sandals with thick wooden soles that keep feet well above the ground. A fabric thong runs between the toes and two supporting wooden teeth are fixed underneath, sometimes with metal plates on.

At times, the girls looked solemn and
reverential beneath translucent white umbrellas, with their matching 
fur stoles wrapped tightly around their necks to keep out the cold.

At
others, they laughed hysterically with friends, clutching Disney 
carrier bags and texting furiously - looking just like the tech-savvy, 
fashionable face of Japanese popular culture today.

The elegant Furisode kimonos are 
likely to be the most extravagant clothes a Japanese woman will 
wear until her wedding day.

The majority of young men celebrating wear suits for
the occasion, although some still wear the more traditional male 
kimono.

A Furisode can cost in excess of 
£6,000 ($10,000), so many rent the outfit to reduce the cost. Hours are 
spent in hairdressers and salons getting ready for the big event.

Seijin no Hi, or Coming of Age Day, is a national holiday that celebrates the transition into adulthood for young Tokyoites, according to Tokyotopia.com.

They are now able to vote, legally buy alcohol and tobacco and to be tried as adults if they break the law.

The ceremony came into being as a Shinto religious rite for members of samurai families.

The boys' ceremony was originally called Gempuku and could take place between the ages of 10 and 16.

During the event, they would be presented with a headdress called an Eboshi and receive an adult male name denoting their new role and responsibilities as an adult, such as marriage.

The girls' celebration, then called Mogi, would occur during the ages of 12 and 16, when they would receive a special kimono and be allowed to dress as an adult female for the first time.

The age of 20 was set as the year a young person moved into adulthood in 1876, during the Edo period.

The modern version of the occasion came into existence in 1948 and now takes place on the second Monday of January each year.

A formal gathering attended by parents and organised by government office 'Seijin Shiki' marks the start of proceedings.

In
recent years, some young Tokyoites can be heard heckling or letting off
fireworks rather than listening dutifully to the sometimes lengthy and 
serious speeches explaining their new responsibilities as adults in 
society.

After that, many 
20-year-olds visit a shrine with their families before the day ends in a
more relaxed manner with young people gathering for parties with 
friends.

Reflective moment: The rain and snow could not put a dampener on the high spirits of these young people

Rich history: The event began life as a Shinto religious rite for members of samurai families only

Moving forward: Clutching bags of Disney souvenirs, the perfectly coiffed young women head to parties with friends after the speeches with their parents
