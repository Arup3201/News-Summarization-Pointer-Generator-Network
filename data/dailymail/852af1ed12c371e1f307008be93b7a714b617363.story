Sunderland winger Emanuele Giaccherini will miss the start of the Premier League season after suffering a groin injury.

The 29-year-old – a £6.5million signing from Juventus last summer – was injured during the Black Cats’ 2-0 victory over Real Betis on Thursday night and will be sidelined for a fortnight, ruling him out of the curtain-raiser at West Brom a week on Saturday.

Manager Gus Poyet said: ‘Injuries are football. It’s not something to worry about. The timing of the injury is not nice for the player.

‘Let’s hope he recovers well and continues playing the way he’s been playing.’

Meanwhile, USA striker Jozy Altidore – who scored once in the league for Sunderland last season – will make his first appearance of pre-season against Udinese on Saturday.

Meanwhile, Poyet has re-signed Argentinian defender Santiago Vergini on a season-long loan deal.

The 26-year-old spent the second half of last season on loan at the Stadium of Light.

And the once-capped centre-back said: 'Firstly I'm very thankful to the club for giving me this opportunity. I am very happy to be here once again.
