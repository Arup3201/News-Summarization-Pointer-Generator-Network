Belgium's 2-1 extra time win over the USA made them the eighth group winners to see off their respective runners up at the last-16.

It is the first time in the tournament's current format that there have been no upsets at this stage - with all eight of the table toppers meeting in the quarter finals.

Here, Sportsmail looks at how all eight made it through against the sides they showed as inferior both in the groups and in the first knockout round.

Relief: The hosts' players celebrate their win on penalties against a tough-to-beat Chile outfit

Impressive: The Colombians, with James Rodriguez, will be confident marching into the last eight

Brazil

Finished above Mexico / Beat Chile 3-2 on penalties (1-1 draw) in the last-16

The hosts found it hard to break down Mexico in the group but were otherwise impressive. Last-16 opponents Chile can give anyone a good game though and Brazil were lucky to make it through on penalties. They have had to rely on the goals from Neymar, who is now carrying an injury, to mask some questionable defending.

Colombia

Finished above Greece / Beat Uruguay 2-0 in the last-16

Arguably the tournament's most impressive side so far. Topped their group easily with nine points from nine available and then comfortably saw off a Luis Suarez-less Uruguay. But now though they face the tournament's toughest task in the form of play hosts Brazil on home territory.

Jumping for joy: Arjen Robben will be making an appearance in the last eight - watch out Costa Rica

Together: Costa Rica will be underdogs against Holland but that has suited them so far

Holland

Finished above Chile / Beat Mexico 2-1 in the last-16

Impressive starters in the group, Holland beat world champions Spain 5-1 before seeing off Australia. Their win against Chile was almost a non-fixture before facing Mexico in the last-16 where it became much more difficult. Late goals from Wesley Sneijder and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar just about dragged the Dutch through in normal time.

Costa Rica

Finished above Uruguay / Beat Greece 5-3 on penalties (1-1 draw) in the last-16

It's fair to call the rest of the sides listed here 'favourites' but Costa Rica certainly have not been at any stage of the competition. Just looking at group winners and runners up ignores their brilliant group finish above long-established nations Italy and England. They then beat Greece on penalties after holding out with 10 men for almost an hour.

Yes! France's fans celebrate their qualification in the streets of Paris after beating Nigeria

Super eight: Mesut Ozil, Andre Schurrle and Thomas Muller have all scored for the Germans

France

Finished above Switzerland / Beat Nigeria 2-0 in the last-16

The French have been experimenting with playing star striker Karim Benzema in the middle and wide - when they have favoured the latter they have often been devastating. Nigeria looked like they could cause the French to implode after frustrating them for long periods but their patience and firepower eventually made the difference.

Germany

Finished above USA / Beat Algeria 2-1 in the last-16

A battle with the French in the Maracana now awaits after Germany saw off plucky Algeria in the last round. They opened their campaign brilliantly with a big win over Portugal but have since occasionally stuttered. The win over Algeria showed some defensive frailties but when Thomas Muller is on top form they can be hard to stop, too.

Made it: Lionel Messi and his team-mates are down to the last eight

We're through! Belgium's players celebrate their win

Argentina

Finished above Nigeria / Beat Switzerland 1-0 in the last-16

Lionel Messi has four man of the match awards from four games at this World Cup - and that is effectively Argentina's story so far. Messi scored four of their five goals in the group as they overcame Bosnia, Iran and Nigeria - and he then had to rescue them by laying out Angel Di Maria's late extra time winner against Switzerland.

Belgium

Finished above Algeria / Beat USA 2-1 AET in the last-16

The Belgians have somehow won all of their games so far but arguably had their reputation tarnished. A lack of attacking football and the fact they have just spent a total of just 52 minutes ahead in all of their games has made them look unimpressive. But they showed against the USA that they still have plenty of firepower, forcing Tim Howard into a record 15 saves. They could potentially be coming into form at just the right time.
