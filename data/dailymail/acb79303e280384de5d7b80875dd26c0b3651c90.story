Katie Hopkins has sparked outrage once again after being accused of making a Holocaust joke aimed at the wife of Ed Miliband

Katie Hopkins has sparked outrage once again after being accused of making a Holocaust joke aimed at the wife of Ed Miliband – whose Jewish parents fled from the Nazis.

The controversial TV pundit faced calls for her arrest after saying the Labour leader could 'gas' his wife   Justine  in a message on Friday.

She tweeted: 'Pollsters say Justine is the least popular of party wives. He might stick her head in the oven and turn on the gas.'

The outspoken star was then bombarded with hundreds of furious messages condemning her 'vile' tweet, with one saying: 'You really are a deplorable and scummy piece of excrement.'

Jay Niew tweeted: 'Katie Hopkins should be prosecuted for her vile gas oven and Jewish tweet. She is sub human both in intellect and character.'

David Price said: 'Is this in poor taste for shady reasons or are you as stupid as you seem? Check his background, look in the mirror and be ashamed.'

Paul Harthill said: 'I seriously hope that wasn't a joke aimed at Jewish people. You really are a deplorable and scummy piece of excrement.'

Jamie Bellinger said: 'I liked you, but you've f***ed up this time. Being unafraid of speaking your mind is good. Holocaust jokes are a step too far.'

The Labour leader has previously spoken about how both his parents, Ralph Miliband and Marion Kozak, fled the Nazis in the 1940s.

He also revealed that a number of his relatives were killed including his grandfather who died in a labour camp.

Speaking on Holocaust memorial day this year, he said: 'It’s 70 years since my grandfather died in one of the camps.

'He ended up in Germany in a labour camp, which is where he eventually died according to the records. 

'There’s horror and there’s hope, because it’s also the case that many members of my family were saved because they were Jews who were hidden by decent people.'

Around 17 members of his family on his father's side were sheltered in a Belgian village after villagers helped to hide them. 

Ms Hopkins was also blasted for saying she hoped Mr Miliband would get oral syphilis after his appearance on the Battle For Number 10 broadcast.

When asked if he was tough enough to lead Britain, the Labour leader answered defiantly: 'Hell yes.'

But that did not impress former the former Apprentice star and she said: 'No you cannot you irritating little man.' 

In a blog entry for Sun Nation, the columnist wrote: 'As Paxman gripped Ed by the throat and shook his skinny bones about like an American pit bull, Ed made like a Westboro baptist and asked himself questions he would rather answer instead.

The TV pundit suggested that Mr Miliband could stick his wife's head in the oven and 'turn on the gas'

'Am I tough enough? Hell yeah! Am I strong enough? Praise the Lord for puny b*****ds! Would I kill my own mother to get at her National Trust pass? Can I get a hell yeah?

'No you cannot you irritating little man. You can get oral syphilis and suck on a lemon.'

She has also courted controversy this week for her comments about the Germanwings disaster.

The TV tweeted saying: 'Sympathy for the co-pilot is making me angry. If you are suicidal, for goodness sake top yourself in private. Attention seeking b******s.'

She followed this up with a number of tweets about depression, including: 'Most depression is just genuine sadness at a social situation. Like being caught in torrential rain with a bag from Primark.'

Ms Hopkins was not available for a comment when contacted.
