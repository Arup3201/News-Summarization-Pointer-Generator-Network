David Cameron entertained supermodel Claudia Schiffer at his official country retreat, official record revealed this morning.

The Prime Minister dined with the pin-up and her English film producer husband, Matthew Vaughn, at a Chequers gathering.

The glamorous pair attended as guests of US ambassador Matthew Barzun, according to an illustrious list of names entertained at Chequers between January and March which was released this morning.

Mr Cameron also held a lunch with Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh in February, the first such royal visit to the grace-and-favour Buckinghamshire mansion for more than four decades.

Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte paid a visit as the PM continued efforts to secure allies in his EU reform effort.

Marks & Spencer boss Marc Bolland, ex-MI5 chief Baroness Manningham-Buller and the head of the UK's armed forces General Sir Nicholas Houghton and the other service chiefs were also guests.

The Prime Minister was sufficiently impressed by a watch gifted to him by Interpol to pay £150 to keep it, while a pair of shoes given by designer outfit Oliver Sweeney cost him £279.

Wine presented by the prime minister of Moldova was served to official guests and a trinket box and coat from outgoing Afghan president Hamid Karzai was retained by Number 10 as it was worth more than the allowed limit.

Film director Richard Curtis - whose movie Love Actually featured Hugh Grant as prime minister - met Mr Cameron in March.

Rather than offering tips on how to dance around Number 10 or stand up to the USA, as Grant's character did, the talks focused on Curtis's campaigning on international development, according to the official disclosure.
