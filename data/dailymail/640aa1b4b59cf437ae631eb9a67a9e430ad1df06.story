These beautiful wedding shots capture the moment a couple tied the knot  - underwater.

The stunning wedding was organized by a dive club called Top Dive, which has launched a new concept for wedding tourism in French Polynesia.

The bride and groom held hands as they stood in front of a Polynesian priest who performed their eye-watering ceremony.

The priest stood at an altar made ​​of pearls to welcome the couple - Nicolas and Alexandra - from Madrid, Spain. 

The couple decided to seal their union four meters under water in the stunning turquoise waters of Bora Bora.

It was the first underwater wedding in this lagoon, but it will certainly not be the last. 

Paul Ramos, manager of thirteen Top Dive diving clubs in Polynesia said he developed the idea to give couples the experience of a lifetime for just €2,700.

Both Alexandra and Nicolas said that they were excited about getting married in such a unique way and donned white wedding diving outfits for their special ceremony. 

Groom Nicolas said: 'I guess it's like walking for the first time on the moon.'

Meanwhile, his bride's outfit was reminiscent of an astronaut's space suit.

And unlike most brides, she did not have to worry about having the perfect bridal hairstyle because she had a helmet on her head.

The helmets had air pumping through them from the surface of the water. 

And just like any other wedding on dry land, an underwater photographer was on hand to capture every moment of the couple's big day.

The priest conducted the ceremony through headphones, which were also connected to the bride and groom.  

The chapel was marked by a curtain of bubbles around two armchairs Pomare - the Polynesian royal seats. 

And at the moment that they had to say 'I do' they did it by putting their thumbs-up. 

Altogether, the ceremony lasted just 20 minutes.

The couple then went on a  bridal canoe and were serenaded by the priest who also knew how to play a ukulele  as he sang a romantic song in Tahitian. 

By the time that the newlyweds reached dry land,  they sipped champagne flutes on a deserted beach, facing the turquoise lagoon and Mount Otemanu, the iconic peak of Bora Bora.
