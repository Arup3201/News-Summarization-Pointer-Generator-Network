'Astonishing' reading: Laura Knowles (above) was five time the drink-drive limit when caught taking her two young daughters homes from the pub

A mother was caught driving her two young daughters while five times the legal alcohol limit after a marathon drinking session.

Laura Knowles, who has five children, had been boozing all day in the pub before driving away in her silver Ford Puma.

Police were tipped off and watched as Knowles drove out of the car park at 7.25pm with her daughters, aged four and five, inside.

Manchester magistrates heard how she drove down the middle of the road without her lights on.

When she was stopped yards from her home, she gave a reading of 187 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath. The limit is 35mcg.

The court heard the officer who stopped her had never seen such a high reading during 20 years in the force.

Knowles, 29, of Darwell Avenue, Eccles, Salford, admitted driving with excess alcohol and being drunk in charge of children under seven.

She was given a three-month suspended jail sentence and banned from the road for three years. She was also ordered to pay Â£85 court costs.

District Judge Paul Richardson told her: 'You have lived a blemishless life and then you behave like this, and to make it worse, kids were in the car.

'I don't think I have come across a higher reading. There is nothing I can do, but to pass a custodial sentence - but I will suspend it.'

Prosecutor Tina Cunnane said: 'The officer was astonished by the reading because she was so lucid and he had never seen one so high in 20 years in the job.'

During a previous hearing, it was said that at one stage Knowles had four of her children with her in the Dutton Arms in Eccles, on Easter Sunday.

Melanie Winstanley, mitigating, said she was devastated at what she had done and realised her stupidity.

She had intended to walk home to check on her other children, but foolishly got into the car.

Miss Winstanley said: 'This was an isolated incident and she is completely devastated.

'She was fully co-operative with the police and honestly believed that she was alright to drive.'

At the first hearing, the judge had said: 'With the amount of alcohol in your system, you were a grave danger to yourself and the children and the general public.'

The court heard that a social services report showed Knowles had good parenting skills and the children were doing well at school.

Miss Winstanley added: 'She seldom drinks, but when she does it is on a binge basis.'

Knowles, who has never been in trouble before, said : 'I am sorry I have done it. I am just glad it is over.'
