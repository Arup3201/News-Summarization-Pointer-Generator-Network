Codner was given a 12-month community order with 200 hours of unpaid work after smashing up a T-Mobile store in a rage over a refund

A judge has condemned a crowd of onlookers for gleefully filming a foul-mouthed yob trashing a mobile phone shop in an 'explosive rage'.

Judge Charles Bloom QC said the crowd seemed to ‘enjoy’ watching 42-year old Jason Codner causing £20,000 of damage in front of other customers following a row over a refund.

Codner shouted: ‘robbing b*******’ at staff at the T-Mobile shop in Manchester then embarked on a three minute rampage as one terrified six-year-old disabled girl in a wheelchair looked on .

In a shocking display of rage he let off fire extinguishers, pulled stock of the walls and overturned tables - whilst staff members took cover in the corner of the store.

But when passersby spotted Codner’s trail of destruction they whipped out their mobile phones - not to dial 999 but to take moving footage of him instead.

They carried on filming as Codner was arrested after one of the staff members alerted police.

It is thought at one point up to 1,500 people were stood outside watching the rampage.

As they handcuffed him, Codner shouted at the five officers: ‘You f****** d********, do you think I give a f***? Have you seen what I’m capable of? You are a f****** c***, you p****, f*** you, you c***.’

The footage was later posted on YouTube and was watched by over 64,000 people.

At Manchester Crown Court, Codner, of Salford, said sorry for his conduct as he pleaded guilty to causing £20,000 worth of criminal damage and using threatening behaviour.

He was ordered to complete a 12-month community order, with 200 hours of unpaid work.

Referring to the crowd outside Judge Bloom said: ‘They seemed to be enjoying the situation.’

He told Codner: ‘This is an extraordinary case with a huge amount of violence to property.

‘You virtually demolished the interior of T-Mobile. You were totally and utterly out of control. It was an explosive manifestation of your personality disorder.’

Angry: He then proceeds to blast equipment with the fire extinguisher

The incident occurred at 4 pm on June 30th when Codner went to the store about a problem downloading music on to a new phone had had acquired.

When it failed to work he demanded a full refund but when it was refused he began to get irate and hurled abuse.

Manchester Crown Court was told there were several customers in the premises and one single customer had a young child, six, who needed an oxygen tank to help her breathe.

They fled as Codner flew into a rage.

The manager pressed the panic button to get help but Codner ripped three desk phones from the counter and threw them outside.

He grabbed keyboards from computers, ripped out the wires and threw them out of the window before destroying computer screens and counters.

Closed: The store had to be closed for five days following the incident

He also sprayed the entire contents of two fire extinguishers over the shop, which was closed for five days afterwards.

The ensuing destruction brought the bustling area to a standstill as other shoppers stopped to watch.

The central store had to be closed for three days in order to be completely re-fitted following the multitude of damage and the business was estimated to have lost over £30,000 in sales.

Codner was later subdued and taken to a nearby police station where a small amount of cannabis was found in his possession.

The court heard he had a previous conviction for false imprisonment after locking the door on a gasman until he reconnected his supply.

After the footage was posted on YouTube one user left a message on the site saying: ‘I think he went over his call allowance! He dealt T-Mobile Manchester style!’

Another said: ‘Why wasn’t that staff member doing something to stop him if that was me I would have sprayed that fire extinguisher in his eyes to stop him.’

A third joked: ‘I hope he didn’t smash his phone up, for that all important last call!’

A spokesman for T Mobile said: ‘The incident was of course very upsetting for our staff.

‘All customers and staff were taken outside of the store as quickly as possible and the police were called immediately to handle the incident.

‘There were seven members of staff and a number of customers in store at the time - and we are very pleased to say that none were injured during the incident.’
