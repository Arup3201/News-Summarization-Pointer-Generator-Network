Labour ‘infantilised’ welfare claimants by letting them choose a life on benefits, David Cameron declared today.

The last government’s handling of the system had divided Britain and created ‘resentment’ among taxpayers, the PM added.

In his first election campaign speech on the benefits system, the PM said it was a ‘national disgrace’ under Labour which had ‘infuriated’ those forced to pay for welfare.

As he appealed to voters for five more years ‘to finish the job’ Mr Cameron outlined his ‘British deal on welfare’ which he said would ‘restore real fairness to our country’.

He confirmed proposals to force jobless youngsters to do community work rather than just going straight on the dole. Instead of signing on, young people will be forced to pick up litter, clean graffiti or work for local charities.

This would give them the ‘order and discipline of turning up for work each day’, he said. There are around 50,000 young people a year who currently go straight on to the dole.

Mr Cameron defended the coalition’s reforms – including the benefits cap, tax cuts for low earners and rises in the minimum wage - and challenged the idea it was ‘compassionate’ to ‘leave people on the dole for years with no incentive to get into work’.

Addressing activists and the media at a school in Hove, East Sussex, he questioned the ‘myth’ that it was ‘kind to sentence people to never going anywhere’ or to let ‘people in their teens and twenties sit at home all day slipping into depression and despair’.

Under Labour welfare became ‘a series of giveaways’. Young people could ‘leave school, sign on, start getting your benefit, start getting housing benefit’ while making only a ‘minimal’ contribution, he said.

He said: ‘No CV? No problem. No real effort put in? No problem.

‘And all this had a corrosive effect. For those paying for welfare – it infuriated them. For those dependent on welfare – it infantilised them.’

‘Because people don’t just live up to expectations – they live down to them too.

‘If you give people nothing to work for, no responsibilities to uphold – they’re going to lose the ability to stretch themselves and find work.

Mr Cameron added: ‘Our welfare system should be something that unites our country in pride – not that divides it in resentment.’

The Prime Minister said Labour treated benefit claimants like children

‘But when people worked hard and paid their taxes, knowing that others were choosing to live on welfare.

‘When they saw their money going on social housing they could never afford to live in. ‘Or when hardworking young people were stuck living with their parents into their 30s – while others got a council house straight out of school, that created a sense of deep unfairness.

‘We are putting that right with a clear set of rules that apply to all; a British deal on welfare.’

Mr Cameron promised people in work would be better off, support for those who are ‘genuinely sick or disabled’ and ‘dignity and security in retirement’ for those who worked hard all their life.

But to anyone who refused to work he said: ‘We will not keep supporting you.’

The PM pointed to the rise in employment, and the 700,000 job vacancies for those looking for work. The Government’s economic plan was working and being felt ‘in people’s pockets and homes and hearts and hopes’, he said.

The Liberal Democrats attacked the plans saying they placements were designed to ‘punish’ young people.

‘These placements are not designed to help someone into work, more to punish. Just like the Tory plans to axe housing benefit for young people, it's all stick and no carrot,’ a spokesman said.

‘Young people should be given help and support into the work place, help at job centres, and the opportunity to get on in life, not just written off as feckless and lazy.’

Labour’s Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Rachel Reeves ministers should introduce ‘Labour's compulsory jobs guarantee to get young people off benefits and into paid work.’

'Under David Cameron young people can spend years claiming benefit without being offered and required to take up paid work. Labour's compulsory jobs guarantee would ensure young people are given the chance to learn, earn and contribute.’
