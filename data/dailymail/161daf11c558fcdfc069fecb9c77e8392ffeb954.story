A severely injured horse left for dead in Oklahoma City is now on the road to recovery after receiving more than $16,000 in donations towards his care.

The equine named Rudy spent two days tangled in barbed wire fencing during freezing conditions. Unable to move, he lost both ears, eyelids and fractured his jaw after being ravaged by dogs.

But last Friday morning he was rescued by workers from Blaze's Tribute Equine Rescue center, who promptly set up a crowdfunding page in a bid to fund his rehabilitation.

As news of Rudy's plight spread, the $8,000 goal was quickly surpassed.

Severely injured: Rudy the horse, who was left for dead in Oklahoma City this New Years, is now on the road to recovery after receiving more than $16,000 in donations towards his care

Oklahoma City Animal Control is currently pursuing charges against the man who called them last Thursday night saying he wanted Rudy removed  from his property.

'They didn't even go out there to check on him to see if he was alive. 

'They didn't call a vet to come out and help or anything like that, and I think that's the most distressing thing,' one of Rudy's rescuers told News 9.

When authorities arrived to collect Rudy they found him in a state of distress covered in blood and mud but still breathing.

He was transported from his paddock on St. Bernard Street to Blaze's Tribute Equine Rescue center.

Sorry state: The equine apparently spent two days tangled in barbed wire fencing - after being ravaged by dogs he lost both ears, eyelids and fractured his jaw

In safe hands: But last Friday morning he was rescued by workers from Blaze's Tribute Equine Rescue center, who promptly set up a crowdfunding page in a bid to fund his rehabilitation.

Vets tended to Rudy's wounds and bandaged him up from head to toe. 

They also administered strong painkillers and antibiotics to fight infection.

After receiving several days of round the clock care, Rudy is able to  walk, see and eat with ease.

'Rudy is just like the movie, he's a fighter,' Shawn Cross of Blaze's Tribute Equine Rescue said. 

Rudy has received overwhelming support from around the world with donations pouring in from far and wide.

When he is given the all clear, the horse will be put forward for adoption. He has already been inundated with offers.

His carers wrote on Facebook this weekend of his progress: 'He is doing really well. He is starved for attention and can't get enough of the loving.

'If you try to leave, he tries to come with you . . . Here is the deal guys, this horse has a fighting chance and will have a good quality of life.'
