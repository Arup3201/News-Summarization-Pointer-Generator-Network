West Ham United are in talks over a possible deal for Boca Juniors defender Emanuel Insua.

The 23-year-old left-back, the younger brother of ex-Liverpool defender Emiliano, has discussed terms with a four year deal proposed.

West Ham also have interest in Nice left-back Timothee Kolodziejczak and Fiorentina’s Marcos Alonso.

Nearly there: Alonso is used to the Premier League, having spent time on loan at Sunderland last year

Alonso is no stranger to the Premier League, having spent time on loan at the Stadium of Light with Sunderland last year.

The 23-year-old may be keen on the move instead of returning to Italian outfit Fiorentina, who are yet to put their faith in the left-back in Serie A.

It is understood Insua has 
agreed personal terms with the Hammers.

It now boils down to whether 
the two clubs can reach an agreement over the next few days.

He would become Sam Allardyce's second Argentinian signing of the summer after Velez Sarsfield forward Mauro Zarate arrived.

Allardyce,
 under the gun to up the style of play at West Ham, is trying to do just
 that and brought Senegalese midfielder Chiekhou Kouyate to Upton Park 
for £7million in a bid to add flair to his squad.

Could be: Timothee Kolodziejczak of Nice is also on West Ham's shortlist
