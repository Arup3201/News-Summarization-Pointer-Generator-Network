More than 5,000 NHS workers are calling in sick every day with the winter vomiting bug.

Cases of norovirus have reached a five-year high and dozens of hospitals are resorting to banning visits from relatives to prevent its spread.

It is estimated that around 900,000 people have been hit by the virus since the summer.

1 in 50 hospital beds are 'closed' due to the norovirus

In the past week alone nearly 100,000
adults and children were struck down with the infection; nearly twice 
as many as this time last year.

Four in ten NHS trusts – 67 in total – have reported outbreaks among patients.

This includes Birmingham City Hospitals NHS trust which has banned visitors from all wards – even those without outbreaks.

Data from the Department of Health 
shows that 2,398 hospital beds are ‘closed’ due to norovirus – equating 
to 1 in 50 of all available beds.

Figures from Firstcare, which 
monitors absence rates, show that an average of 5,263 NHS staff are 
calling in sick with typical symptoms every day.

And during November some 128,800 working days were lost in the NHS due to employees being off with sickness.

It is estimated that 0.4 per cent of the 1.4million workers in the NHS are off sick with symptoms.

It is not known what proportion are 
frontline staff but they are likely to be in the majority, as they are 
mostly in contact with patients.

Officials from the Department of 
Health insist that the NHS is ‘coping well’ with the outbreak. But 
experts said that the high numbers of staff falling sick was putting 
extra pressure on already-overstretched wards.

Dr Ian Hosein, director of infection 
and prevention control at Barking, Havering and Redbridge University 
Hospitals in East London, said: ‘There is significant norovirus activity
out there in the community and of course our staff go home, and they 
will become exposed. The danger for us is that they could bring it into 
hospital.

‘Staff will also catch it on the wards.’

Experts are not sure as to why 
norovirus is so severe this year, with the number of cases 83 per cent 
higher than this time in 2011.

Figures from the Health  Protection 
Agency show since July there have been 3,046 confirmed reports – where 
the virus has been properly tested in the lab.

But as most victims do not consult their GP, the HPA estimates that for every confirmed report there are 288 cases.

This implies that 877,000 adults and children have been struck down since the summer.

Symptoms include vomiting, diarrhoea, a headache and a  temperature. They usually resolve themselves in a couple  of days.

But it can be dangerous in the 
elderly or in patients with serious underlying conditions and is thought
to cause around 80 deaths a year.

John Harris, an expert from the HPA 
said: ‘It is very contagious so we would urge anyone who thinks they may
be unwell with norovirus to stay at home.’
