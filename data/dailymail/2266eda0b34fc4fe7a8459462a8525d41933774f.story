When 26-year-old Sophie Linfield put on her blue British Airways cabin crew suit and headed to work earlier this year, she could never have expected the Transatlantic trip she was working on to end with a proposal from one of Britain's wealthiest entrepreneurs.

But this was no indecent proposal. Sophie, who had been tending to Ultimo chief Michelle Mone in the First Class cabin, made such an impression on the billionaire businesswoman that Mone handed the BA employee her details and implored her to enter a competition she was holding to find 'real women' to model the lingerie brand's latest collections.

Bemused Sophie put the experience aside. But when she landed, something compelled her to call Mone's PA, who asked Sophie to send in a natural photograph of herself and fill in an entry form - which she did.

'I got my brother's girlfriend to take a photo of me in the garden, just wearing jeans and T-shirt,' Sophie says.

'But I didn't hear anything back for a few weeks, so I just chalked it up as one of those crazy things that happen.

But then after a month, I had a call saying I'd won. I couldn't believe it.'

Sophie, who has never modelled, says she had always felt lacking in confidence when it came to body image.

'I had never posed in underwear - I would never have considered doing anything like this. I was terrified ahead of the shoot, and I really didn't enjoy posing. I felt awful, and I was so nervous.

'Fortunately, all ten of us taking part in the shoot had been chatting all week on Facebook, so when it came to posing on the day, I felt like I was among friends.

'The photographer was so nice, and Michelle came down on the day, which was lovely.'

Despite her nerves, Sophie says that posing in her underwear gave her a huge and unexpected confidence boost.

'It made me realise that we are all different. Women come in all shapes and sizes,' she said. 

'We can't all have bodies like celebrities - we don't have chefs and personal trainers. But everyone is beautiful in their own way.'

Such was the transformation that 
Sophie says she would now be happy to give her delighted fiance Nick, 
also 26, a treat ahead of their wedding next year.

'I
have never been one for nice underwear,' she says. 'I have a drawer of 
mismatched knickers and bras. But Ultimo gave us the lingerie we were 
wearing on the day, and a few other nice pieces, so my underwear drawer 
has been transformed.'

Now I wouldn't think twice about posing for my boyfriend in lingerie and heels,' she laughs.

Thousands of women entered the national contest, which is held annually to raise money for charity.

Most
enter online, but two secure their place through a charity auction - an
event that has raised a total of £120,000 since its launch three years 
ago.

Michelle Mone whittled down the entries to the final 12 winners, who ranged in size from 8 to 18 and bust sizes from A to G.

The girls, who will join Helena 
Christensen, Luisana Lopilato and Rachel Hunter in the Ultimo Hall of 
Fame, are part of Ultimo's goal to blur the boundaries of what lingerie models should look, and to show that 
women of all ages, sizes and shapes can be beautiful.

Fellow winner Dawn Williams said the 
only day that had come close to matching her experience on the lingerie 
shoot was her wedding day. 'I felt as if I was dreaming,' she said.

'The
best thing about being an Ultimo Real Women Winner is it has made me 
feel special, feminine and more confident. To sum up my experience is 
easy: life changing.'

Donna Evans said the experience had made her 'proud' of who she is. 'The best part of being an Ultimo Real Woman is the 
confidence it's given me.'

'I never really 
believed in myself. But now I'm going to go out there and get what I 
want from life and love me for me.'

Michelle Mone OBE, said: 'I love the Ultimo Real Women campaign. It gives us the opportunity to showcase some of the beautiful ladies out there who otherwise might not get the chance to model lingerie.

'It's incredible the feeling the ladies get after the shoot and the new found confidence it gives them.

'I’ve posed in my lingerie and I can vouch that its not an easy thing to do. I want women to celebrate their bodies.

'Since the 
campaign started we have raised an incredible £120,000 for charities 
including Breast Cancer Care, Cash for Kids and Children with 
Leukaemia.'

The twelve winners were taken to London for a big budget celebrity-style
fashion shoot with the Ultimo ‘glam team’, including celebrity 
photographer Dan Kennedy, hair and make-up artists, stylist and lighting
experts – the same team who worked with Ultimo babes Luisana Lopilato 
and Sarah Harding.

Ultimo is available at www.ultimo.co.uk  and Debenhams stores nationwide.
