Dan Houser, creator of video game series Grand Theft Auto, seems to be having trouble letting go of his Manhattan mansion.

After buying Truman Capote's former Brooklyn mansion less than a year ago for $12.5million, Mr Houser, 39, promptly put his five bedroom, three bathroom 7,000-square-foot loft in Soho up for sale asking $12.25million.

But the three-story condo was taken off the market and has since been re-listed five times. Now the triplex penthouse is back on the market, but this time for $10million.

Last year, Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz almost bought condo, but for unknown reasons, the deal fell through.

Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes of Douglas Elliman, who have the listing, describe Mr Houser's pad as having 'glamour, drama, soaring ceilings, blinding light and glass.'

It has 'massive wall space for an extensive art collection,' and an 'oversized' chef's kitchen with a large pantry.

Mr Houser, who is reportedly worth $80million, swapped his Manhattan condo in March 2012 for Truman Capote's historic townhouse - the same house where he wrote Breakfast at Tiffany's.

The Rockstar Games co-founder managed to bag the 11-bedroom mansion for $5.5m below the asking price of $18million.

The open home will be held on Sunday, February 3rd, between 2:00 PM and 3:30 PM.
