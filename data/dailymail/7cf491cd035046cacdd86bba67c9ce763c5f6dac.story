It may seem unlikely as the annual Christmas spending spree gets under way, but a survey has found the British are among the least materialistic in the world.

Out of 20 countries, people in the UK were ranked third least concerned with material things, whereas China was top, followed by India and Turkey.

More than 16,000 people including 1,000 in the UK, were asked whether they agreed with the sentence: ‘I measure my success by the things I own’.

Least materialistic? A study found the UK is one of the least concerned nations regarding material things. Londoners, pictured here, are said to believe money is not everything

Only 16 per cent of British respondents said yes - with only Spain, at 15 per cent, and Sweden, at 7 per cent, coming lower.

Meanwhile, 71 per cent of Chinese and 58 per cent of Indian people polled said they measured their status by what they owned.

People in Britain were also far less materialistic than those in France, where 34 per cent of people agreed, Russia, which had a score of 32 per cent, or even Germany, where 27 per cent of people thought money equalled success.

The question was asked as part of Ipsos MORI Global Trends Survey.

In other answers, the proportion of the British public who feel under a lot of pressure to be successful and make money has risen significantly during the recession, from 27 per cent in 2008 to 39 per cent in 2013.

Frenzy: But it seems that didn't stop shoppers in North Tyneside battling for cut price 
electrical bargains at an Asda store in Benton last month. The shelves were cleared within a minute and a man brawling was arrested

The global phenomenon is far more prominent in China, India and Turkey, according to the Ipsos MORI survey

Manic: There were reports of fights breaking out in stores across America, including this in Annapolis this year

This still places Britain slightly 
below the 46 per cent global average. We feel under less pressure than 
those in emerging markets and North America, but under more pressure 
than some of our European neighbours, including the Italians and the 
French.

Bobby Duffy, 
managing director of Ipsos MORI’s Social Research Institute, said: ‘As 
the country emerges from recession, the British public’s concern about 
the national economy has fallen. But worries about our personal finances
persist, and we are feeling under more pressure to make money.

‘Yet we do not like to see ourselves as measuring success by the things we own, perhaps because we have more possessions to begin with.

'It is certainly the case that a materialistic outlook is much more common in emerging markets.

Unnecessary: Although Amazon's Swansea branch is seen here preparing for Black Friday and Cyber Monday this year, the survey showed Britons largely believe money isn't everything

'And the fact that most Britons remain
optimistic about their own lives suggests that we may actually believe 
that money isn’t everything.’

People remain relatively pessimistic about Britain over the next year - with just 25 per cent saying they were optimistic.

However, 61 per cent of Britons were optimistic about themselves and their families over the next 12 months, in line with the global average of 59 per cent.

Optimism about the country’s prospects is highest in India at 53 per cent, Canada (47 per cent) and Australia (47 per cent), while Spain (12 per cent), Italy (ten per cent) and France (nine per cent) were the least optimistic. 

The same three European countries were in the bottom five on personal optimism, with Japan (40 per cent) and South Korea (39 per cent) even lower.
