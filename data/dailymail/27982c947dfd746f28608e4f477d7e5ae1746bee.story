Controversy: Tamera Foster tweeted about smoking marijuana and has now been spoken to by X Factor bosses

Teenage X Factor singer Tamera Foster has been carpeted by TV bosses after boasting online about smoking marijuana, it emerged today.

The 16-year-old posted pictures of what appeared to be an unlit cannabis joint and tweeted about the effect of smoking 'Zoom' - marijuana coated in the class-A drug PCP.

In one tweet she wrote: 'Woiiii I just woke up :O that zoom last night put me to sleeeeeep garddd.'

In another she wrote: 'Time to fly high with my sis @LivvsParkerx'. Under the picture on her Twitter account she made several references to 'Mary Jane' - slang for cannabis.

X Factor chiefs have spoken to her and she is understood to be 'mortified'. Her account has now been suspended.

Tamera, from Gravesend, Kent, has been tipped to be a major star with judge Gary Barlow telling her on tonight's second show: 'You have potential beyond belief'.

A programme spokesman told the Sunday Mirror: 'The X Factor does not condone the use of drugs in any way and appropriate action will be taken against anyone found to be taking drugs while under our care.'

On January 13, Tamera reposted the picture of the 'joint' on her Twitter account - @DiorTee - with the words: 'This would please me right now.'

The paper reported she posted another picture of herself with a friend pointing out the effects marijuana can have, writing: 'Flying high with my homie Presh. Just look at my eyes mate.'

In another tweet, she wrote: 'Riding that morning wave with @LivvsParker x & The Sweet Mary Jane. Previously she had written: 'Inhale that good s*** exhale the bulls***

An X Factor source told the Sunday Mirror that Tamera had been 'spoken to' but because she was young that did not want to be too hard on her and 'ruin' her chances.

A show insider told MailOnline: 'She was 15 when she posted those comments. She was very young and naive. She just mad a big mistake and now wants to move on.'

Twitter followers have claimed the account isn't Tamera's but although she stopped using it months ago, it was still 'live'.

She had originally auditioned in Cardiff with 22-year-old Jerrie Diller as part of a duo Silver Rock. But the judges though they lacked chemistry and asked them to sing separately.

Tamera gor through easily and tonight will sing Whitney Houston's I have Nothing.

Drug scandals have twice rocked X Factor in the past with Frankie Cocozza being kicked offÂ  the show in 2011 for using cocaine, while Wagner faced the axe in 2010 for buying cannabis inside the TV studios.
