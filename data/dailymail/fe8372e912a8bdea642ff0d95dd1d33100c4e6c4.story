A third girl was due to take part in the Peru drug smuggling plot which has seen two British women caught with cocaine worth £1.5million, it has today been reported.

The girl, who claims she was enlisted to carry the drugs alongside Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollom Connolly, said she is now in hiding and fears for her life.

Both women face up to 25 years in prison after they were caught with the haul at Lima Airport.

In an interview with the Sunday People the woman - who is in her 20s - says she changed her mind at the last minute and immediately left Ibiza for the UK, reportedly scared of the 'revenge' the plotters may enact.

It comes as doubts have been raised about Melissa and Michaella’s story.

The women claim they were targeted by Colombian drug gangsters on the party island of Ibiza, who kidnapped them and threatened them with guns as they were forced to fly to Peru.

But police on the island say they believe they were acting of their own accord.

The third girl says she has been willing to join them on their return trip to Peru, which was arranged by a British man they met in Ibiza reportedly nicknamed The Cockney.

She met Melissa shortly after arriving in Ibiza to work for the summer season, and soon the pair were partying together, a source told the paper.

They claim that former sales assistant Melissa, from Lenzie, near Glasgow, was heavily involved in the island's drug culture after losing her job at the Ibiza nightspot Millennium Bar.

The former friend, who asked to remain anonymous, rubbished the two girls' version of events.

He claimed two of Melissa's friends and another man transported cocaine from Majorca to Ibiza in June, and that she was 'so impressed she agreed to take part'.

He said she believed the £11,000 she was to be given for her part was 'easy money'.

Michaella's legal team said that she was innocent and was kidnapped and forced to carry cocaine. Human-rights lawyer Peter Madden said she is prepared to give full details to the police

He added that she had not been forced into anything: 'If gangsters had really been forcing her to go through with it they would never have let one of the girls suddenly walk away. This wasn’t a case of the third girl achieving some great escape.'

The source - who claims he urged her not to get involved -  lived in the same apartment block as Melissa in San Antonio Bay. He said she knew what she was getting involved in. 

He claims that Melissa had been in contact with a friend while she was away via Facebook, who then tried to delete the messages. 

The man added that Melissa 'loved the flash lifestyle' and had been partying every night. 

But both girls deny all of the allegations and all suggestions they were involved in drug taking.

Michaella’s legal team said that she was innocent and was kidnapped and forced to carry cocaine.

Human-rights lawyer Peter Madden said she is prepared to give full details to the police.
