Allegations: Lydia Vasiliev took three-year-old Elena to a London hospital like this and a doctor apparently asked her: 'Why have you come on a Saturday?'

A hospital is investigating after a mother who rushed her child to A&E said a doctor told her she would be better off going to 'the moon' than getting treatment on a Saturday.

Lydia Vasiliev took three-year-old Elena to the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, north London, after she woke up covered in lesions across her face and body.

But she alleged a doctor asked her: 'Why have you come on a Saturday? How am I supposed to help you?'.

The 32-year-old, of East Finchley, north London, said her daughter - who has suffered from multiple food allergies and severe eczema since birth - had been admitted to the Royal Free twice in the previous month with a series of infections.

Mrs Vasiliev said: 'After a sleepless night and appearance of new lesions on Elena's skin we decided to go to the A&E.

'A doctor walked in said, 'Why have you come here on a Saturday? How am I supposed to help?

'I said, "Well where am I supposed to go with a sick child - the Moon?" and he said: "Yes that would be better.''

'I was deeply shocked. Children don't stop being sick over the weekend.'

Mrs Vasiliev walked out of the Royal Free
and drove to the nearby Whittington Hospital, where an A&E doctor treated her child and 
diagnosed severe chicken pox.

Probe: The Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, London, has said it is investigating the complaint and will interview the doctor involved

The mother-of-two has now filed an official complaint with the Royal Free Hospital saying she only went to A&E as a 'last resort'.

A spokesman for the Royal Free Hospital told MailOnline it was investigating the incident, and would interview the doctors at the centre of the claims

She said: 'We are very sorry to hear that Ms Vasiliev was unhappy with the care her daughter received at the Royal Free.

'We appreciate how upsetting it must have been for her to see her daughter distressed.'
