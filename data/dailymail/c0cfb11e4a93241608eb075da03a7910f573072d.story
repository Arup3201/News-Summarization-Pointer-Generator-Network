Three Romanians have pleaded guilty to stealing seven paintings, including works by Picasso, Monet and Matisse, from a Dutch museum in a daring night raid that shocked the art world.

Radu Dogaru, Alexandru Bitu and Eugen Darie, told a Bucharest court today that they took the multimillion-dollar paintings from the Kunsthal Museum in October 2012. They are charged with the theft and of bringing the paintings into Romania.

The works have never been found, and may have been burned.

Guilty plea: Romanian suspects Eugen Darie (R) and Radu Dogaru (L) pleaded guilty today to stealing paintings worth millions of dollars from a Dutch museum in Rotterdam

In their depositions to prosecutors, the suspects, who were arrested in January, said they brought the paintings to Romania, tried to sell them on the black market, then left them with Dogaru's mother, Olga Dogaru.

Chief suspect Radu Dogaru told the court Tuesday that when he stole the paintings on the night of Oct. 15-16 he thought they were fakes. 'I could not believe you could enter as easily as that,' he said.

He told the court that the paintings were handed over to a Russian Ukrainian man whom he identified and wrote the man's address on a piece of paper for the court. The name was not publicly confirmed.

Stolen: 'Reading Girl in White and Yellow' by Henri Matisse, left, and 'Harlequin Head' by Pablo Picasso, right, were two of the seven paintings stolen from the Kunsthal gallery in Rotterdam last October

Destroyed? Charing Cross Bridge, London by Claude Monet is one of the more famous works that Ms Dogaru claims to have burned

Gone: Waterloo Bridge, London by Claude Monet has not been seen since the theft in October 2012

Dogaru denied the paintings had been 
burned in his mother's stove. He said that remains of paint, canvas and 
nails identified in the ash by a Romanian museum could have been from a 
fence with handmade nails or from 19th century icons that were in the 
family home

Olga Dogaru, 
who is charged with handling stolen property, had told investigators she
burned the paintings, but later denied it.

Six
Romanians have been put on trial in the case, including one who is 
being tried in absentia and another who is not under arrest.

Missing: Prosecutors say that they do not necessarily believe Ms Dogaru's claims that she destroyed the paintings including Girl in Front of Open Window by Paul Gauguin, pictured

Robbery: Self-Portrait' by Meyer de Haan, left, and Woman with Eyes Closed by Lucian Freud, right, were two of a collection of 150 paintings on display in Rotterdam at the time of the heist

Disappeared: An empty space where one of Henri Matisse's stolen paintings was on display is pictured following the heist

Thieves
broke in through a rear emergency exit of the Kunsthal, grabbed the 
paintings off the wall, put them in sacks and fled - all within minutes -
in the biggest art heist to hit the Netherlands for more than a decade.

The stolen works were 
'Tete d'Arlequin' by Pablo Picasso, 'La Liseuse en Blanc et Jaune' by 
Henri Matisse, 'Waterloo Bridge' and 'Charing Cross Bridge' by Claude 
Monet, 'Femme devant une fenetre ouverte, dite la fiancee' by Paul 
Gauguin, 'Autoportrait' by Meyer de Haan, and 'Woman with Eyes Closed' 
by Lucian Freud.

The paintings have an estimated value of tens of millions of dollars, if sold at auction.

Burial: The local cemetary, presumably the place where stolen paintings were allegedly buried before being destroyed, by Olga Dogaru, mother of a Romanian art theft suspect, is pictured in Carcaliu village, Romania

Location: A general view of Carcaliu village. Local resident Olga Dogaru - mother of suspect Radu Dogarus, accused of stealing seven masterpieces from Monet, Picasso and Gauguin - said she burned the artworks
