A 22-year-old woman, who is suspected of robbing two banks, has been arrested in a little more of a disheveled state than the glamorous look she sported to allegedly pull off the heist.

Charlotte Willenzik was found by police at her grandparents' home on January 9, a day after she held up a Chase branch, authorities said.

She is believed to be the same young woman who was seen with a glossy blow-dry and full make-up on surveillance camera at the branch in Scottsdale, Arizona.

Captured: Charlotte Willenzik, 22, was arrested at her grandparents' house in Cave Creek, Arizona

Police tracked the Willenzik to a 
house in nearby Cave Creek after receiving anonymous tip-offs when they 
released her photo to the public.

She was arrested on suspicion of robbing the Chase branch  in Scottsdale on January 8 and another bank in Phoenix on January 7.

When officers searched the 22-year-old's bedroom at her grandparents' house, they found cash taken from both robberies.

The young woman later admitted to detectives that she had stolen the money to fund her drug habit.

She was booked at Scottsdale City Jail and is currently in custody at  Maricopa County Jail.

Willenzik allegedly made her getaway from the Chase bank robbery in a gold, mid-sized sedan. The driver has not been identified.

On January 8, a 5'7, brunette woman walked up to a male bank employee behind the counter and showed him a demand letter.

She then fled the building with an undisclosed number of bills and was seen getting into a sedan andÂ  heading towards Scottsdale Road.

No weapon was used in the robbery and no one was injured in the attack. The thief, who has long, dark hair, was wearing glasses and dressed in boots, a black, belted coat and red gloves.
