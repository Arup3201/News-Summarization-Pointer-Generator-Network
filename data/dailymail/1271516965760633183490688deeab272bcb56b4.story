Teachers were celebrating today after Michael Gove was ousted as Education Secretary.

The controversial minister was dumped from the Cabinet by David Cameron to become the Government's chief whip in the biggest shock of the reshuffle. 

Teachers' unions  welcomed the surprise announcement after years of bitter antagonism against his reforms, which culminated in last week's classroom walk out-in a dispute over pay and pensions.

Downing Street insisted Mr Gove would play a key role in the run up to the election and had not been demoted - but the decision to move him comes amid increasing evidence that he is 'toxic' with voters. In May a poll for YouGov found he was the most hated politician in the Government.

Michael Gove was deeply unpopular with teachers and his demotion from the Cabinet was welcomed by unions this morning

During his four-year stint at the Department for Education Mr Gove clashed frequently with the educational establishment he dismissed in private as 'the blob'.

Teachers' unions attacked his attempts to introduce far-reaching reforms to England's schools system.

He pushed through radical changes to exams, the curriculum, childcare, primary school testing, teachers' pay and league tables.

At the same time, Mr Gove spearheaded the introduction of one of the Conservatives' flagship education policies - free schools - and threw the doors open to allow all schools to apply to become academies.

But his time in charge has been marked with a spate of strikes - and claims that he wants to take the education system back to the 1950s.

Just last week the National Union of Teachers staged the latest in a series of national walkouts in a long-running bitter row over pay, pensions and conditions.

Mr Gove will now become 'minister for TV' - and will tour the television studios in the run up to the next election promoting the Government. 

He will also ensure the Prime Minister and Chancellor George Osborne maintain an 'iron grip' on the Conservative Party over the crucial next nine months.

Privately educated Treasury minister Nicky Morgan, 41, will replace Mr Gove as Education Secretary.

Mr Gove's removal was welcomed by teaching unions - part of the educational establishment which he reportedly derided in private as 'the blob'.

Christine Blower, General Secretary of the National Union of Teachers, the largest teachers’ union, said: 'Michael Gove has clearly lost the support of the profession and parents for justifiable reasons.

'His vision for education is simply wrong. His pursuit of the unnecessary and often unwanted free schools and academies programme, the use of unqualified teachers, the failure to address the school place crisis and endless ill-thought out reforms to examinations and the curriculum have been his hallmark in office.

'Michael Gove’s search for headlines over speaking to the profession has clearly angered teachers. We remain in dispute over the direction of Government policy, which we believe is undermining the education service.

'We will be seeking a very early meeting with Nicky Morgan, the incoming Education Secretary, and we look forward to not only a new personality but a more conciliatory approach, one that demonstrates an improvement in policy for children, teachers and young people.'

General secretary of the Association of Teachers & Lecturers Mary Bousted added: 'David Cameron has belatedly realised that Michael Gove's ideological drive is no substitute for measured, pragmatic reform of the education system.

'Time after time he has chased newspaper headlines rather than engage with teachers.

'The dismantling of the structures which support schools, the antagonism which he displayed to the teaching profession and the increasing evidence of chaos in the bodies he established, in particular the Education Funding Agency, has led Cameron to one conclusion - Gove is more of a liability than an asset.

'Successful education systems value the views of the teaching profession, which Gove insulted when he called them 'the blob'. ATL looks forward to a more constructive relationship with his successor, Nicky Morgan.' 

The Education Secretary was a lightening rod for the teaching profession's anger over the Government's reforms

Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union said that Ms Morgan is inheriting 'a teaching profession on the brink of a recruitment and retention crisis after an unrelenting assault on teachers' pay, pensions and conditions and their professionalism'.

He added: 'Teachers are buckling under the pressure of increased workload and the threat of job loss, and morale is at an all-time low.'

Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers was more conciliatory - praising Mr Gove as a 'sincere and radical reformer of education'.

But he added: 'He often failed to bring the profession with him, which sometimes meant that his reforms did not land in schools as well as they should have done.

'His diagnosis was often right, but his prescriptions were often hard to swallow.'

Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw appeared shocked as he learnt of Mr Gove's departure during a call-in session on LBC Radio.

'I'm surprised and shocked that this has happened. I'm a great admirer of the Secretary of State, I think he's been a transformative and radical minister of education.'

Michael Gove's sacking immediately began 'trending' on Twitter - as one of the most talked about events in the country

Mr Gove's move to Chief Whip will be seen in Westminster as a demotion from a job in which he has shown a personal passion for free schools and stringent academic standards but has met fierce opposition from teaching unions.

As Chief Whip Gove will not be full member of Cabinet, Number 10 have confirmed.

But the Prime Minister's official spokesman this morning rejected accusations that Mr Gove had been demoted.

He said: 'I know that the new Chief Whip has been involved in planning for the reshuffle for some time.

'What we have seen Michael Gove achieve over the last four years, a series of landmark reforms in the education system.

'Now, going forward, in the run-up to the general election, the Prime Minister wants Michael Gove, just as William Hague, right at the heart of his government team.

'That’s why he has taken on the role of chief whip, and as part of that you should expect to see a great deal of Michael Gove on you television and radio channels.'

Mr Cameron also welcomed his Mrs Morgan's appointment. His spokesman said: ‘He appoints the people who are right for the job and he thinks Nicky Morgan’s track record makes her the right person for that role.’

The spokesman highlighted that Mrs Morgan had championed help with childcare bills while at the Treasury. 

Public sector workers - including thousands of teachers - marched across the country last week   over pay, pensions and cuts

In the most dramatic reshuffle of his premiership, Mr Cameron also promoted Defence Secretary Philip Hammond to replace William Hague as Foreign Secretary after the surprise announcement last night that the former Tory leader was moving to become Leader of the Commons before quitting as an MP next year.

Liz Truss becomes the youngest member of Cabinet at 38 after being appointed Environment Secretary to replace Owen Paterson, who ran into trouble over the failed badger cull and his handling of the winter floods, as well as antagonising green groups with his scepticism about man-made climate change.

But Labour described the reshuffle as the 'massacre of the moderates' as a host of right wingers were promoted. 

Former Treasury minister Nicky Morgan was announced as the new Education Secretary. She is a privately-educated mother of one, who trained as a solicitor

Nicola Ann 'Nicky' Morgan completed her rapid rise to the Cabinet this morning, replacing Michael Gove as Education Secretary.

The London-born 41-year-old only become an MP in 2010 - representing Loughborough in the East Midlands.

She was quickly made a junior whip before becoming a Treasury minister in October and attending the Cabinet in her second role as women's minister - a position she will keep as Education Secretary.

Mrs Morgan is a trustee of the Conservative Christian Fellowship and voted against same-sex marriage because of her faith.

This is widely seen as the the reason Mr Cameron split the women and equalities brief last year - leading to accusations that she was the 'minister for straight women'.

Teachers celebrating Mrs Morgan's rise may be left disappointed - as she has strongly backed every single education reform pushed through by Mr Gove.

She voted very strongly for free schools, academies and tuition fee increases.

The Tory minister has also never attended state school herself - attending the exclusive £4,701-a-year Surbiton High School in south west London.

Mrs Morgan went on to study law at Oxford before becoming a high flying city lawyer in 1996.
