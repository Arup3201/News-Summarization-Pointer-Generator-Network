An allegedly violent man who created a fake dating website profile to convince his ex-wife to skip a court appearance for a protection order against him has been charged with stalking.

Using a fake name and stolen pictures, Brian Matthew Cornelius lured his former wife into an intimate digital relationship during which she shared intimate details about her ex-husband for more than a year.

But when the 36-year-old man started showing up to the same places as his ex-wife, the Minnesota woman put the pieces together.

Stalker: Be careful who you talk to online

According to charges filed Tuesday in Dakota County District Court, Cornelius, from Sturgeon Lake in Minnesota, exchanged emails, texts and other electronic communications with his ex under the pseudonym 'Aaron Carpenter' about three months after their divorce.

The pair were married from 2000 to 2011 and have two young children.

Throughout the 'extensive' online union, the West St. Paul woman 'confided intimate details of her life and daily activities' and her concerns about her ex-husband, the Mercury News reports.

She also let her 'online boyfriend' see her in her home via webcam, the complaint said.

Then in March last year, the woman told 'Carpenter' about her plans to get a protection order against her ex after he allegedly physically assaulted her.

He persuaded her to drop the court appearance - the order request was dismissed.

About five months later, the manipulated woman discovered Cornelius' trickery after he started showing up at places she told 'Carpenter' she would be.

That's when she applied for an order for protection, which is still active, and confronted Cornelius online.

He confessed everything.

She told police she felt 'terrorized by Cornelius' and unsafe in her own home.

West St. Paul police Investigator Shawna Curtis told Mercury News  it's common for estranged husbands to keep tabs on their ex-wives online.

'Sometimes if they're that obsessive, that's how
they're getting around to harassing or stalking or monitoring,' she said.

In a court document filed in November in St. Louis County
Court over custody issues, Cornelius made reference to a protection order 'based on allegations that I set up fake online personalities in an
attempt to stalk her.'

Under the terms of that order, active until August, Cornelius must not have contact with his ex-wife except to facilitate
phone calls with their children.

His faces court for stalking on July
1.

Cornelius did not immediately return a phone call from The Associated Press seeking comment.
