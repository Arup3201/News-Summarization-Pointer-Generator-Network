Great Britain claimed three medals on the second day of the UEC Elite Track European Championships in Guadeloupe.

Ed Clancy, Jon Dibben, Owain Doull and Andy Tennant beat Germany’s men by almost a second in the team pursuit to clinch gold, while Katie Archibald, Elinor Barker, Joanna Rowsell and Laura Trott defeated the Russian team by nearly seven seconds in the women’s final. 

This was the fourth time in five years that both team pursuit squads have triumphed at the Championships. 

Four-time world champion Ed Clancy helped Great Britain to two medals on Friday

In the men’s scratch race Clancy, the four-time world champion, was third behind Belgium’s Otto Vergaerde and Spain’s Eloy Teruelrovira. 

The victories held even more importance to the squads as the Championships in Guadeloupe are the first to carry qualifying points for the 2016 Olympic Games.
