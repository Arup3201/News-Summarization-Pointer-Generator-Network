Claims: The veteran DJ, pictured arriving at court today, is alleged to have groped the woman while she was dancing

Dave Lee Travis told a British 
Airways sales rep she had ‘won the key’ to his room after sexually 
assaulting her at a Christmas party, a court heard yesterday.

The
 former BBC Radio 1 DJ, pictured, made a beeline for the young woman at 
the start of a lambada dance and allegedly told her: ‘I’m claiming this 
dance.’

Travis, now 
68, groped her during the dance before dragging her to a table where he 
was sitting with BA executives, the court was told.

As
 hundreds of staff celebrated at the work party, the DJ forced her to 
sit on his knee and then pushed his hand up her skirt, the jury was 
told.

He then ‘touched her intimately’, it was alleged.

The woman, now 43, told Southwark Crown Court yesterday that she tried to distract the DJ by talking about a raffle ticket.

When she told him she had not won a prize Travis stuck the ticket to his head and said: ‘You’ve won the key to my room.’

The
 DJ, whose real name is David Griffin, was the star act at the party in a
 Manchester Airport function room in 1993, it was said.

Both times she said he grabbed her to dance the Lambada and described how he became sexually 'aroused' after 'grinding' against her.

Giving evidence from behind a screen, the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said after she was forced to dance with him she planned to make her 'escape' but he 'didn't let go'.

She told jurors she considered just sitting next to Travis before politely making her excuses and leaving, claiming she did not want to make a scene.

But then, he allegedly pulled her on to his knee before placing his left hand on her thigh.

'His left hand started creeping up my leg,' she said.

'I immediately put my hands on it. My hands were both on it permanently trying to push it down.'

But she said Travis was much stronger than her and he then started rubbing his thumb against her groin.

'First of all he was rubbing on the outside of my knickers and then on the inside,' she told the court.

The woman said she decided to try to distract Travis by talking about the raffle that had taken place as part of the evening’s events as there was a ticket lying on the table in front of them.

'I said to him I hadn’t won anything. That’s when he slapped it on his head and said "You’ve won the key to my room".'

The woman said she was 'really scared'
 and when she said she wanted to go to the toilet with a colleague, 
Travis said: 'Don’t confer with your friends.'

'He said "There’s a toilet at my hotel".'

The
 alleged victim said she thought Travis was a 'dirty perv' and a 'dirty 
old man' but did not go to police at the time as she was 'too young and 
too stupid'.

But she decided
 to tell her friends what happened after the allegations about Jimmy 
Savile came out and said: 'Mark my words, he’ll be next.'

The woman told the court she first encountered Travis a few weeks before the Christmas party when he compered an event, organised after company targets were reached.

She said he organised a Lambada dance competition, which he judged and she and her partner won.

The woman said there was a 'Latin American atmosphere' in the room as they performed the intimate dance, which involved couples getting up close and holding hands.

She said that, after naming her as the winner, he ordered that the song be repeated and 'then he grabbed me as his partner and started dancing with me'.

The woman told the court that he 'kept pinning me against his leg' as they danced.

'He was sexually aroused,' she said. 'I was trying to put as much distance 
between us as could as I thought it was inappropriate but he was a lot 
bigger than me and he kept pinning me against his leg.

Master of ceremonies: Travis was a compere at the corporate event where he is accused of groping the woman

'He was old enough to be my father. I just thought "dirty perv".'

Asked
 why she did not tell her bosses or police what had happened at the 
time, the woman said: 'He was a big star. I thought 'Who was going to 
believe me?'"

The woman said she then encountered 
Travis again when he was the compere and DJ at the Christmas party and 
did her best to avoid him.

But claims she realised he had seen her and he requested that guests dance the Lambada again.

She told jurors: 'Dave Lee Travis made a beeline for me and said he was claiming this dance as his again. Everybody was cheering.'

The woman said she was 'in shock' when
 she eventually left the party and vaguely remembered being put in a car
 by a colleague, who drove them away.

A
 friend of the alleged victim also gave evidence to the court and said 
she told them what Travis allegedly did to her during conversations they
 had in September or October 2012.

Another
 woman told the court she thought Travis was a 'dirty old man' after he 
put his hand up her skirt during a car journey when she was 21.

The woman, who was sharing a lift with
 Travis and her friend after a party, said she was 
'absolutely shocked and mortified'.

She
 told the court that Travis asked her what she did and, when he found out she was a student nurse, he asked if she wore stockings.

She said she was embarrassed by the 
question and could not remember what she replied, but he then 'put his 
hand into the back of the car and pushed it up my skirt'.

'He put his hand between my legs on top of my thighs,' she said.

She 'pushed them away as hard as I could' and used 'quite a lot' of force. 'I was pushing hard and for a few moments he was pushing back,' she said.

Fame: The former Radio 1 presenter is currently on trial for sex offences. He denies 13 indecent assault charges and one sexual assault, dating back to 1976 and the height of his fame.

The woman, who also gave evidence from behind a screen, said she was a 'shy and quiet girl' and so did not say anything at the time.

'I just put it down to him being a dirty old man,' she said.

The woman said she went to police last year after reading a newspaper article in which he defended himself after other allegations against him surfaced.

She told jurors: 'He was quoted as saying he would never behave in that way. I thought "Well, you did behave in that way to me".'

Wearing a grey woollen blazer, dark trousers and a multi-coloured tie, Travis sat in the dock and listened to the evidence through headphones.

Travis, denies 13 indecent assaults and one sexual assault, dating back to 1976 and the height of his fame.

The alleged offending includes when he 
was working as a BBC DJ, as a broadcaster with Classic Gold radio, while
 appearing on Top Of The Pops, and when starring in panto.

The trial will continue tomorrow.
