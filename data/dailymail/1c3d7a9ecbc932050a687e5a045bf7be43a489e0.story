First she was told she had breast cancer. Then doctors explained that the treatment she needed to save her life might rob her of the chance of having children.

For Natasha Eaton, 32 at the time of the diagnosis and desperate to be a mother, the news was devastating.

'I basically went outside into the street and I just screamed,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was just like all of a sudden, having children wasn't an option for me. It was a very traumatic day.'

Natasha Eaton, 38, was told she might not ever be able to have children when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008

Ms Eaton, from Newcastle, New South Wales, had been prescribed weeks of chemotherapy. While the treatment destroys cancer cells it can also lead to infertility and early menopause in young women.

But she was determined to do anything she could to increase her chances of having children and resorted to an egg retrieval procedure at an clinic in Sydney.

IVF treatment, however, was not necessary. Only six months after finishing chemotherapy, Ms Eaton was ecstatic to find she was naturally pregnant with a healthy baby boy. 

 

Now mother to four-year-old Jack, she was one of the 256 young women with breast cancer around the world who participated in the Prevention of Early Menopause Study.

The study saw half the participants receive a dose of the drug goserelin alongside their standard chemotherapy treatment, while the other half received their cancer treatment without.

'I had to have my chemotherapy every three weeks for six rounds. I got to the fourth week and I'd already had enough,' Ms Eaton explained.

Ms Eaton required chemotherapy after removing the lump on her breast through surgery. Chemotherapy not only destroys cancer cells in the body, but also often leads to early menopause in women

'And then once a month I had the [goserelin] injections. It was just a like a pellet that went into my tummy and put my ovaries to sleep.'

The goserelin injections were administered in an attempt to stop the women's ovaries from producing eggs while they received chemotherapy, according to Professor Fran Boyle, chair of the Breast Cancer Trails Group.

'What started the study was the idea that if you can switch your ovaries off and put them into resting stage, in theory that should make them less susceptible to chemotherapy,' professor Boyle said.

'There are drugs that already do that, but they are used for other purposes. So this study just re-purposed a drug used for another reason to see if that ovary resting would help preserve fertility and prevent early menopause.'

Astonishingly, the study proved successful, with only 8 per cent of the women who received the goserelin injections experiencing menopause two years after their cancer treatment. This was compared to the 22 per cent of women who went through early menopause after receiving standard cancer treatment with no injections.

The goserelin recipients were also twice as likely to have normal pregnancies after their cancer treatment, a reality that still astonishes Ms Eaton.

'There was never any trying at all,' she said of her natural conception.

'I finished in June with the chemo part, but I still had to have radiation therapy. When I had an ultrasound in September, we saw that my ovaries were still shriveled up and asleep and I was panicking.

'Fran said it was alright and we'll just see how we go, but I jokingly asked her "can I have a baby now?" and she just said "no, no, not yet."

'The next time I saw her, I was pregnant.'

Ms Eaton fell pregnant in December, only six months after finishing her treatment. In February, she found herself experiencing morning sickness, but thought nothing of it until daring to take a home pregnancy test. 

'It was a scary time. The thought went through my mind: "am I going to have to terminate him?"  I wasn't even sure if I was allowed to have him or if there would be something wrong with him – it was a scary lot of mixed emotions,' she said.

After the initial shock and perfect amniocentesis results, she was over the moon –  now Ms Eaton can't imagine her life without four-year-old Jack.

'He’s an old soul – he's definitely been here before,' she said. 'He's way above his years and he's quite a character.'

Professor Fran Boyle, who ran the trial, said the results showed that goserelin injections could also lead to similar positive results in women with other cancers

Ms Eaton has since had her ovaries removed as a preventative measure and will likely have a double mastectomy, but the proud mother can't imagine her life without her new son

Ms Eaton's battle with cancer is not over, however. After removing her ovaries in a bid to avoid her high risk of developing ovarian cancer, the proud mother is now looking towards a double mastectomy for similar reasons.

But with her chemotherapy days behind her, and her happy little boy helping her get through it, Ms Eaton said she finally has room to breathe. 

Despite the study only being administered in breast cancer patients, Professor Boyle said the results showed that goserelin injections could also lead to similar positive results with other cancers.

'This is a drug that can be accessed in Australia today, so it can be done,' she said.

'It's not covered by the PBS for this purpose though, so people need to buy it, but what we hope is that the company that makes it will now apply to have it funded for this purpose.

'The benefit of this study is that it will also be able to be used in other kinds of cancer for similar benefits as well, including lymphoma.'

'One of the other important things, is that although it was run in a large number of countries in the world, it was actually an idea initiated in Australia. By collaborating with researchers in other countries we were able to have found enough young women in this situation – we couldn't have done it just in Australia.'
