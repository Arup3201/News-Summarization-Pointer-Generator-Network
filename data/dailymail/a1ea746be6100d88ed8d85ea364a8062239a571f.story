Mick Jagger spent an idyllic day in Perth on Monday visiting a park, a sculpture exhibition and having a relaxed late dinner of seafood with a beer, before he was left shattered by the news that his longtime girlfriend L'Wren Scott had taken her own life.

The band has since cancelled their Wednesday night concert in Perth.

But In the hours before the tragic news was broken to him outside a restaurant, Jagger visited Perth's iconic Kings Park early in the day and wandered among the Sculptures By The Sea exhibition.

Later, he visited Cottesloe beach, before returning to his hotel in the late afternoon.

His hotel, The Hyatt Regency, then booked him a table for two at Coco's Restaurant under a false name.

Jagger turned up at 9.45pm with a younger man, who was believed to be his British business manager.

He ordered a seafood entree and the two men spent an hour chatting over a relaxed dinner at a secluded table overlooking a magnificent view of the Swan River.

Jagger dined on local fish and the men chatted with one of the waiters, who is also English, about the UK and the sights of Perth. 

'(He was) relaxed, friendly and very polite and nice,' an employee at Coco's restaurant told the MailOnline.

The Stones frontman drank one beer, a Little Creatures Pale Ale.

After an hour at his table, Jagger had just finished his main course when a woman rushed in and  whisked Jagger and his business partner away.

The news of Ms Scott's death was broken to them both outside of the restaurant, before the English rocker left - his face carrying an unmistakable look of grief.

As the night went on, further details emerged about Ms Scott's death - including that the 49-year-old had hanged herself inside her Manhattan apartment.

Scott's body was discovered in her Manhattan apartment around 10a.m. Monday, which is 10pm Monday in Perth.

Devastated: Jagger said he was 'devastated' and in shock after hearing the news about Scott, whom he'd dated since 2001

Soon after leaving the restaurant, Jagger said through a spokesperson that he was 'completely shocked and devastated' after hearing the news and the rep replied 'of course' when asked if the pair were still in a relationship when she took her life.

One report in the New York Post claimed the couple had called it quits, which Jagger's rep slammed as '100% untrue.

'There is absolutely no basis in fact to this story. It is a horrible and inaccurate piece of gossip during this very tragic time for Mick,' the spokesperson told JustJared.com in a statement.

One U.S. fashion source told MailOnline: 'Everybody who knows L'Wren and Mick are totally and completely shocked. Neither of them drink and do drugs, and they were always really affectionate with each other. There were no signs of problems in their relationship.'

It's expected the Rolling Stones will cancel the Australian tour on account of the fashion designer's death.

Scott was found by her assistant early Monday after hanging herself. There was no immediate suspicion of foul play though the Medical Examiner has not yet released the formal report.

Police said she had left no note - but she had sent a text to her assistant to 'come by.'

On Tuesday, the MailOnline revealed that the talented fashion designer was $6million in debt to her creditors when she died and was distraught and 'embarrassed' over her failing business.

L'Wren, who had been dating the rockstar since 2001, first broke into the fashion industry as a stylist before launching an eponymous line in 2006 that was a major hit with celebrities.

Fans included Oprah Winfrey, Nicole Kidman and Michelle Obama. She had even been tipped to design Angelina Jolieâ€™s wedding dress.
