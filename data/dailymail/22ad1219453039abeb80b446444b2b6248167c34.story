In a show of breathtaking contempt and defiance, the man behind the Srebrenica massacre taunted  survivors and the families of  victims with a chilling cut-throat gesture yesterday.

At the opening of his war crimes  trial in The Hague, Ratko Mladic  stared at Muslims in the packed  public gallery and ran his hand  across his throat.

The 70-year-old former Bosnian Serb  general, dubbed the Butcher of Bosnia,  is accused of orchestrating the worst  massacre in Europe since the Second World War. He faces life imprisonment for the slaughter of 8,000 unarmed Muslim boys and men in 1995.

On arriving at court yesterday he gave a thumbs up and clapped.

And after the cut-throat sign, the judge was forced to halt proceeding briefly to order an end to ‘inappropriate interactions’.

Prosecutor Dermot Groome told the court that Mladic and other Bosnian Serbs divided the territory of the former Yugoslavia along ethnic lines and implemented a plan to exterminate non-Serbs. He said that by the time they had ‘killed thousands in Srebrenica’, they were ‘well-rehearsed in the craft of murder’.

And he said Mladic was part of a ‘joint criminal enterprise to eliminate the Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica by killing the men and boys... and forcibly removing the women, young children and some elderly men’.

Video footage shot at the time and shown to the court showed Mladic mingling with Muslim prisoners.

Shortly afterwards, the men and boys were separated from the women, stripped of identification and shot. The dead were bulldozed into mass graves, then later dug up and hauled away in trucks to more remote areas to be better hidden.

Referring to an earlier massacre, Mr Groome said: ‘The world watched in disbelief that in neighbourhoods and villages within Europe a genocide appeared to  be in progress.’

He added that there was ‘no doubt’ that Mladic was also responsible for the siege and bombardment of the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, which prosecutors said was intended to ‘spread terror among the civilian population’.

Mladic had promised that the city would shake, he said.Mladic is the last of the main protagonists in the Balkan wars of the 1990s to go on trial at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague.

He was the Serb military commander in the Bosnian war of 1992-95. His former political leader Radovan Karadzic is about half way through his trial on similar charges.

Mladic, who was arrested in a Serbian village last May after 16 years on the run, has dismissed the charges as ‘monstrous’ and says he is too ill to stand trial. He has pleaded not guilty.

It took 17 years to bring Mladic to trial in what observers say is a testament to the loyalty he inspired among Serbs and the power of their nationalist cause.

But as Serbia's goal of integration with Europe overtook its defiance, he lost his comfortable protection.

And by the end he was reduced to sheltering, penniless and sick, in a cousin's farmhouse.

The son of a World War Two partisan fighter killed in 1945, Mladic was an officer in the old communist Yugoslav Federal Army (JNA) when Yugoslavia's disintegration began in 1991.

When Serbs rose up in 1992 against Bosnia's Muslim-led secession, he was picked to command the army that swiftly overran 70 per cent of the country.

It was a model of ruthlessness, daring and brutality in the Serb warrior tradition once prized in the life-or-death struggle against Nazi Germany.

But NATO officers who dealt soldier-to-soldier with Mladic when UN evenhandedness was official policy later came to regret shaking his hand.
