Construction work is being blamed for the collapse of this Chinese petrol station which sank into a giant hole.

It is thought that building site workers weakened the ground around the filling station in Hangzhou city in Zhejiang province causing a big crack to appear down the front of the building.

Pump attendant Tao Ku was on duty when the earth began to shift and the 50,000 ton steel and concrete station began to be consumed by the earth.

The 25-year-old said: ‘I was filling up the tank of a Lexus when I suddenly felt this ominous shaking and juddering, just as if there was an earthquake.

‘Suddenly the pump motor cut out and I looked up to see a gigantic crack appear down the front of the building.

‘Then the lights began to flicker and there was a perceptible tilt to the forecourt.  “Get away, get away, we are sinking” shouted my boss.

‘I told the Lexus driver to beat it and I ran for my life.’

China’s push for urbanisation has caused several man-made disasters, with construction sites often unsafe for both workers and people living near them.

The pump attendant added: ‘There has been so much construction in this area the place underground is riddled like a honeycomb.

‘One set of workers in one building has no clue what their counterparts just yards away are doing.

‘They dig ancillary road and sewage tunnels, tunnels for electric cabling and pipes, caverns for underground car parks and then they wonder why buildings above don't stay put!’

A town planning spokesman said they would be an investigation into what caused the station to collapse

All fuel had to be pumped out of the station and into tankers before being moved to giant tanks 10 miles away.

A wrecking ball then arrived to demolish what remained of the submerged building.

A town planning spokesman said: ‘We are launching an investigation into what made the petrol station disappear into the bowels of the earth.’
