A 13-year-old boy in a small Colorado town is accused of shooting his father twice in the head and trying to hide the killing for days by telling the man's employer his father was sick.

The boy was arrested Monday after a tip from the unidentified employer led deputies to check on the family.

Authorities said the boy, identified by local news outlets as Kai Kelly, answered the door and told them his 50-year-old father, Joseph Kelly Jr, was dead in the home. The coroner said the man had been dead for about six days.

Authorities said they still don't know a motive for the killing.

Before the slaying, the boy was under 
scrutiny for spraying graffiti, the Eagle County Sheriff's Office said. 
Mr Kelly didn't show up for a meeting with deputies last Wednesday to 
discuss the graffiti investigation in the western Colorado town, but it 
wasn't until the employer's tip that authorities went to investigate, 
sheriff's office spokeswoman Jessie Mosher said.

Kai Kelly was being held in a detention facility on suspicion of first-degree murder.

The
 sheriff's office said the boy's mother had not been living in the home 
with her son or ex-husband, but would not release any more information.

Neighbors
 told KCNC-TV that the man and his son lived in the home for more than a
 year, but no one heard anything out of the ordinary until deputies 
showed up.

Eagle County coroner Kara Bettis said Kai is suspected of firing at least two shots, the station reported.

‘There
 was one to the back of the head and one to the temple,’ Bettis said. 
‘The one to the temple was contact and the one in the back of his head 
was from farther away.’

Joseph Kelly's employer at the Eagle County ECO Transit Department said the son called in to report his father sick several days in a row. He grew suspicious and reported the situation at around 11.30am Monday.

'Several' types of weapons were in the home, according to VailDaily.

The Denver Post reported Kai Kelly is a student at St. Clare of Assisi Catholic School, and he also has been taking lessons at a karate school in Gypsum. In November, he took third place at the U.S. Karate Nationals.
