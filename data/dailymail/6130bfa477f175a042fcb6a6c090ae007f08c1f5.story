The parents of a young girl diagnosed with a rare and deadly disease have raised more than half a million dollars in the past two weeks thanks to a viral video which helps explain their plight.

Glenn and Cara O'Neill's 4-year-old daughter Eliza was diagnosed with Sanfilippo Syndrome Type A in July.

The rare genetic disorder causes pre-school children to first lose the ability to speak, then to walk before they develop seizures. Most suffers don’t live far into their teens.

Eliza O'Neill, four, has a rare degenerative condition which will soon leave her unable to speak or walk unless a cure can be found in the next six month

Glenn and Cara O'Neill have raised more than half a million dollars in the past two weeks thanks to a viral video which helps explain their plight of their 4-year-old daughter Eliza. They are pictured with Eliza and her older brother, Beckham

The South Carolina couple are 
desperately trying to raise $1 million to help fund research trails 
which if implemented quickly enough could give Eliza and other young 
suffers hope.

The couple
 had already raised $250,000 through localized fundraising efforts over 
the last six months, when they decided that a viral video campaign would
 help them reach a wider audience.

The
 O’Neils connected with filmmakers DL Cade and Benjamin Von Wong, who 
produced the film for the family: 'Be part of the miracle: Saving Eliza', available on YouTube and on a GoFundMe fundraising page.

The
 video tells the story of Eliza, a Dora the Explorer-loving toddler 'who loves
 to sing, run and most of all, cuddle. She loves to play dress up and 
horse around with her rowdy big brother Beckham'.

The response to the Eliza video has surpassed her family's wildest expectations as news of their daughter's plight has spread around the globe

The
 response in just two weeks has surpassed their wildest expectations as 
news of their daughter’s plight has spread around the globe.

‘It’s
 been fabulous,’ Glenn O’Neill told ABC. ‘It’s going places, I don’t 
exactly know how. It was in Italy for a while, and Belgium and China.’

The O’Neil’s set themselves a target of raising $1m and have already raised more than $530,000.

Sanfilippo
 Syndrome is caused by a defect in a single cell that eventually leads 
to progressive degeneration of the central nervous system.

The disease is considered rare and estimates are 2,000 children every year are born with Sanfilippo around the world.

'We don't want to be two years from now and say as parents that we left anything on the table,' said Glenn O¿Neill about the plight of their young daughter

The money being raised is going towards trials to be run at the Nationwide Children's Hospital in Ohio

Advocate: Actor Jonny Lee Miller is also campaigning to raise money to find a cure for the rare disease

‘From a parent
 perspective, until someone comes in and tells us a big company is going
 to pay for it, a hospital, or the government, we are left to go out and
 do it ourselves,’ said Glenn O’Neill.

‘There is no other choice. I think that is why people are connecting with this video and story.’

A
 possible cure has been uncovered by researchers Doug McCarty and Haiyan
 Fu of Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. They’ve found a
 gene therapy treatment that works in mice, and they hope to try it in 
humans.

The money raised
 by the O'Neills will go toward the first human clinical trial, and they
 hope that their daughter will be selected.

The
 O’Neills know there’s no guarantee Eliza will get into the clinical 
trial or that it will work, but said they need to try everything they 
can for their only daughter.

Doctors estimate that Eliza will stop being able to speak in six months.

‘We don’t want to be two years from now and say as parents that we left anything on the table,’ said Glenn O’Neill.

Another campaigner raising funds to find a cure for Sanfilippo Syndrome is actor Jonny Lee Miller.

The
 Elementary star has actively campaigned for more funding since learning
 that a crew member's son, Jonah, was diagnosed with it.

'The answers and the cures are right around the corner,' Miller told CBS.

'There’s just not enough money going into this right now, and we’re talking about little kids.'

Miller has addressed a congressional caucus in Washington on behalf of rare disease organizations.

He is an advocate for the Jonah Just Begun Foundation and will be running in the North Face Bear Mountain Run in Bear Mountain, New York on May 4 and 5 for Jonah and for Jonah Just Begun.
