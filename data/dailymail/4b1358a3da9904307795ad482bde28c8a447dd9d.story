Catalan Dragons coach Laurent Frayssinous praised his side's character after they claimed another notable scalp to move to within 80 minutes of a maiden Super League Grand Final.

The French club twice came from behind to gain a thrilling 18-16 win over Huddersfield at the John Smith's Stadium and will meet St Helens for a place at Old Trafford after they were selected under the ClubCall system.

Frayssinous cited the example of forward Louis Anderson, who stayed behind in Perpignan to be with his wife when she gave birth to their latest child but caught a flight on the day of the game.

But it was in marked contrast to the dejected Huddersfield Giants' dejected players, whose season ended

'He was due to flew this morning but the flight was delayed and he didn't arrive until 4pm this afternoon,' Frayssinous said. 'That's where the team is. We don't want to let our team-mates down.

'We believe in each other and the boys showed character and dug in very hard. I'm very proud of them. Their attitude was great.

'We want to keep on believing in ourselves and challenge the team that finished first.

'Credit to the boys they dug in very hard. We have got a great attitude and don't want to let our team-mates down. We want to be proud of wearing that jersey.

'It has been tough physically because we knew we would be tired but I am delighted with the win."

The Dragons, who knocked out Challenge Cup winners Leeds in the first round of the play-offs, scored tries through three-quarters Ben Pomeroy, Michael Oldfield and Daryl Millard to repeat their 2009 preliminary semi-final win at the John Smith's Stadium.

The match had been in some doubt after a power failure left half the stadium in darkness but it kicked off on time after both clubs expressed a willingness for it to go ahead.

Frayssinous said: 'We went in middle of field and said we would not find any excuses about our performances. The players have got a good attitude and they wanted to perform on the field no matter what.'

Huddersfield were much improved from their 57-4 hammering at Wigan but an 11th defeat in 14 play-off ties left coach Paul Anderson bitterly disappointed.

'It hurts more than last week because the year is over,' Anderson said. 'We saw an improvement in some areas and the scoreline wasn't as bad as last week.

'But it was a reflection of our year. We were good in patches. All year we have never strung 80 minutes together and it was the same tonight. We never turned the screw and it has been the tale of our year.

'I am massively disappointed about the season. We started round one with big expectation but consistency throughout the year cost us.

'It wasn't just week by week but within games.

'We have had inconsistencies within performance and individual performances throughout games. It ends up hurting you.

'We went into this game with every expectation of winning, going to St Helens and winning the competition. But it has gone.

'For the investment in this team and this club it's not good enough. We need to be better.'
