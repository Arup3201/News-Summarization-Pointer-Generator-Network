A 24-year-old Marine recruiter in North Carolina sexually assaulted two teen-aged recruits, according to police reports.

Sergeant Derek Craig Percival was charged with attempted second-degree rape, involuntary servitude, sexual battery and communicating threats and remains in prison, the local sheriff's office told reporters.

Police told local reporters that the alleged assaults took place at a Marine recruiting office in Salisbury, a suburb of Charlotte, as well as Percival’s apartment, where he lives with his wife and two children.

Officers arrested him there on Saturday, according to NBC station WCNC in Charlotte.

One of the victims, a 17-year-old girl who was not named, told the station that she had met Percival four or five times to discuss joining the Marine Corps.

She said she had gone to his apartment for a party in September and that she also stayed overnight at his place last Saturday, while his family was there, since she and other recruits were unable to get a ride home.

She said that early Sunday morning Percival forced her to have oral sex with him and threatened to kill her if she told anyone.

‘He said, “If you don't let me, I'm going to rape you,”’ she told WCNC. ‘And I said, “No you're not, just go away, just stop.”’

She said that Percival approached her again later that morning and asked for sex.

Another recruit, a friend of the first alleged victim, said that Percival had asked her to show him her breasts and give him oral sex when she visited the recruiting office he worked at.

Percival has an attorney, according to the Marines, though the attorney’s name was not provided. Percival has not entered a plea on the charges.

Defense Secretary Leon Panetta ordered a review of all military policies and procedures in an effort to curb sexual assaults reported in the military after a sharp rise in the number of reported cases last year.

Those reported cases included at least a dozen instructors accused of assaulting recruits at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, in September of 2012.
