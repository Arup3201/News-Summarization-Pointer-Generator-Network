American scientists have transformed people into cows using immersive virtual reality programmes with the aim of persuading them to eat less meat

American scientists have transformed people into cows using immersive virtual reality programmes with the aim of persuading them to eat less meat.

The University of Stanford's Virtual Human Interaction Lab allows people to step into a cow's hooves for a surreal experience.

The hi-tech computer software subjects humans to being virtually poked with cattle prods and eventually dragged to a virtual slaughterhouse.

Researcher Jeremy Bailenson hopes that participants find the experience so moving that they emphathise with the cattle and choose to eat less meat as a result.

The thinking behind the project is that you remember what it is like to face being taken to slaughterhouse, even in a virtual world.

And as a result, you might choose a vegetarian dish for dinner.

The implications of such an experience are huge as eating less meat translates into less energy consumption,Â Vice.com reported.

As well as turning people vegetarian, the researchers hope that the experience will also make participants think about how their behaviour on a daily basis contributes towards climate change.

It is not the first time the researchers have used virtual reality technology to make people aware of their impact on the environment.

Individuals who virtually cut down trees said they thought about the experience later and reduced their paper usage.

The Virtual
 Human Interaction Lab is designed to 'harness the emotive power of 
empathy' and although it uses modern technology, the theory is not new.

Animal groups have previously used many tactics to create emotional understanding between humans and the animals they eat.

On the simplest level, leaflets are designed to match pictures of beguiling animals with shocking facts that tug on the heartstrings.

But still images and statistics have a relatively short-term effect, according to the researchers.

It is thought that animal sanctuaries are much more successful as they not only rescue farm animals, but encourage people to interact with them.

The sanctuaries hope that as people interact with the animals, they might recognise them as individuals with personalities, not just meat and change their actions.

The same is true with this latest experiment. The scientists said that becoming the animals in a virtual world and stepping into their hooves was a natural extension of this idea and a new way of encouraging people to empathise.
