Alan Pardew insists that the last thing Newcastle and Sunderland supporters should be doing is ‘fighting each other’ – and believes the Malaysian Airlines disaster has brought the rival fans closer together.

A fund set up by a Sunderland supporter in memory of the two Newcastle fans killed when flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine in July raised more than £33,000.

The teams face each other for the first time on Sunday since the clubs joined forces in tribute to John Alder and Liam Sweeney, who died on their way to watch the Magpies play in New Zealand.

The Tyne-Wear derby has been heavily policed in recent seasons amid fear of trouble and in April, 2013 Newcastle fans - following a 3-0 home defeat - clashed with law enforcers as they rampaged in the city centre. One man was later jailed for punching a police horse.

Pardew, though, senses an effort to make the fixture about the passion on the pitch rather than vitriol in the stands.

‘I am hearing the right stuff on the radio and in the street about the levels of antagonism between the two clubs dying down a little bit to what it's really about – a football match. I am really pleased about that and hope it carries through to Sunday,’ he said.

‘I said two years ago that this nasty hate – those kinds of words – needed to go out. It’s a rivalry, a game of football, may the best team win and then we shake hands and go home.

Pardew said the last thing the North East should be doing is fighting each other

‘The last thing the North East should be doing is fighting each other. But, at the same time, we know it's a massive rivalry and the passion of the game shouldn't be lost.’ There has been suggestion that Newcastle fans could applaud during the 33rd minute of the match in a show of thanks for the money raised for charity by the JustGiving fund.

And Pardew added: ‘The incident with the Malaysian flight has definitely helped build bridges and we need to carry on doing that.

‘The way the Sunderland fans contributed and the effort they made has made great steps to help this fixture become what it should be, a spectacle for the North East. Not something where we have to order extra police.’ 

Sunderland boss Gus Poyet suggests that alcohol should not be sold on the day of the Tyne-Wear derby

Pubs in Newcastle, meanwhile, have confirmed that they will not be serving alcohol before 10am. That is three-and-a-half hours before kick-off and Sunderland boss Gus Poyet would rather drink was banned entirely on derby day.

‘You want a friendly derby? Don’t sell alcohol (throughout) the whole day in Newcastle and maybe you’ve got a chance,’ he said.

‘But if you’re going to let everybody go to the pub and you want them to behave, you’re a little bit naive. Quite naive.

‘But I’m a head coach, I’m not in the police department. I’m not going to make that decision. But let’s not be too naive.’
