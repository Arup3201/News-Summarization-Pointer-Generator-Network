Microsoft is to drop both the Nokia and Windows Phone brand names in favour of just using Lumia.

The company is beginning a transition to change all of its branding to simply Microsoft Lumia, just in time for the holiday season.

The Finnish firm Nokia will live on as a separate company, though, focusing on mapping and network infrastructure.

A report by The Verge says Microsoft is preparing to axe the Nokia name. The change by the Washington firm will see phones simply called Microsoft Lumia from now on (Lumia 730 shown). Both the Nokia brand name and Windows Phone are being dropped in the shake-up of Microsoft's phone business

The change was first reported by The Verge and has now been confirmed by Nokia France on their Facebook page.

They wrote: 'In the coming days, you will receive a Facebook message regarding the change of name of this page.

'We are on the verge of becoming "Microsoft Lumia!"

'Stay-tuned for more soon.'

The move brings an end to Nokia’s name being on mobile phones, a long run that stretches back into the 1980s.

'Some of today’s press reports related to rumours about Microsoft dropping the Nokia brand have declared the death of the Nokia brand,' said Barry French, Executive Vice President, Marketing and Corporate Affairs.

'But, to paraphrase Mark Twain, “reports of our death are an exaggeration.”

'Yes, we have sold our mobile phone business to Microsoft. But the Nokia of today is financially robust and has moved from weakness to strength.

'We have one of the world’s best telecom infrastructure businesses, a global leader in the mapping and location business, a stellar intellectual property portfolio and some of the finest innovation capabilities of any company anywhere.

'Remember, Nokia started almost 150 years ago with just one paper mill. Over time we have repeatedly and successfully reinvented ourselves.

'We may not be the same Nokia of several years ago, but we are here, we are strong, and our brand is very much still alive. Not to mention kicking!'

It was first hinted at when Microsoft moved Nokia.com to be hosted on Microsoft’s own site.

Each country will gradually see branding changed from Nokia to Microsoft Lumia across various social media accounts, beginning with Nokia France.

Microsoft bought Nokia’s phone business in April in a £4.5 billion ($7.2 billion) deal. 

It’s unclear if the changes will affect existing Microsoft smartphones though, or only ones set to be released in the future.

Nokia phones will likely elicit fond memories for many, though, with the Nokia 3310 in particular being one of the defining phones at the dawn of the cell phone age.

First released towards the end of 2000, the phone went on to sell 126 million units world wide and continues to enjoy a cult status.

Nokia has been quick to assure customers that the company will live on, albeit no longer in the mobile phone business.

In a blog post back in September Barry French, Executive Vice President, Marketing and Corporate Affairs at Nokia said: ‘To paraphrase Mark Twain, “reports of our death are an exaggeration.”

‘Yes, we have sold our mobile phone business to Microsoft. But the Nokia of today is financially robust and has moved from weakness to strength.

‘We have one of the world’s best telecom infrastructure businesses, a global leader in the mapping and location business, a stellar intellectual property portfolio and some of the finest innovation capabilities of any company anywhere.’

He continued: ‘We may not be the same Nokia of several years ago, but we are here, we are strong, and our brand is very much still alive. Not to mention kicking!’

When reached for comment by MailOnline Microsoft was yet to confirm or deny the rumours. 

The move brings to an end nearly three decades of Nokia phones, which will likely elicit fond memories for many, with the Nokia 3310 (shown) in particular being one of the defining phones at the dawn of the cell phone age. But it's unclear if the change will affect existing phones or just new releases
