The Colonial-style home where Newtown school shooter Adam Lanza lived with his mother now belongs to the town after local officials agreed to buy it for $1.

Mary Ann Jacob, head of the Newtown Legislative Council, says the council voted on Wednesday to accept ownership of the house. It was deeded to the town by a bank that owned it.

Jacob says any decision on how to use the property would come later and would involve the Board of Selectmen.
