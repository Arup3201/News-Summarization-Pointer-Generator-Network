An eight-week-old puppy is slowly recovering after it was dragged behind the bumper of a minivan for nearly one mile by a man who says he didn't know it was tied to the trailer hitch. 

When others drivers flagged down Walter Samano, 24, outside Bryan, Texas, on Sunday and forced him to pulled over, he untied the mangled pup, left it on the side of the road and sped off. 

Other motorists followed Samano to a nearby convenience store, where police arrested him on animal cruelty charges.

Josiah was rescued from the side of the road

Little Josiah is expected to make a full recovery in time. The deep scars from where his hide was scraped away by the road will heal. 

But for the time being, he remains weak and in incredible pain. He whimpers whenever he moves.

'He does have a long road to go. A recovery that will take some time. The swelling has gone down, he seems to be a little bit more mobile and eating well,' Julianne Burkhalter with Bryan Animal Services told KBTX-TV. 

Samano told KBTX he didn't mean to drag the puppy behind his van. He said his nephew brought the dog, which belongs to a friend, over to his house and  tied it to the trailer hitch on his van. 

He said he didn't even realize the dog was there.

Samano claimed that once he realized he dragged the dog, he left it behind because he was scared.

He told the TV station that he just moved to the country and was afraid what would happen to him and his family if he brought the puppy to authorities.
