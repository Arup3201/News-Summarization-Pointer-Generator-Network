The funeral of a 24-year-old soldier who died during SAS selection training in the Brecon Beacons took place today.

Lance Corporal Craig John Roberts collapsed on July 13 - one of the hottest days of the year - while climbing South Wales’s highest mountain.

He was one of three soldiers who died after taking part in the gruelling exercise on Pen Y Fan.

Around 100 members of the public stood outside Holy Trinity Church in Llandudno, North Wales, for the funeral, which was given full military honours.

Tragic: The coffin of Lance Corporal Craig Roberts is carried into the Holy Trinity Church, Llandudno for his funeral today. He collapsed on July 13 while climbing South Wales's highest mountain for SAS selection training

Grieving: Margaret Roberts, mother of Lance Corporal Craig Roberts, is consoled by a fellow mourner following her son's funeral

L/Cpl Roberts’ coffin was draped in a Union Flag. Members
of his family, including his parents Kelvin and Margaret, aged 53 and 
54, stood outside the entrance of the church and watched as the coffin 
was carried in. 

His mother and father stood linking arms as they struggled to contain their emotions.

Speaking outside the church, Lieutenant Colonel Paul Morris, Commanding Officer 3rd Battalion, The Royal Anglican Regiment, said: 'Craig was a talented young man with a bright future ahead of him, both as an army reservist and in his civilian life.

'Craig was the epitome of the can-do volunteer ethos.'

Lt/Col Morris added: 'Craig will be 
missed dearly by everyone who knew him; his family, his friends, his 
colleagues. We will miss him greatly and we will remember him.'

L/Cpl
Roberts, 24, of Penrhyn Bay, and Edward John Maher died while taking 
part in the aptitude training element of the course to become SAS 
reservists.

Corporal James Dunsby, 31, fell ill during the same training exercise and died two weeks later in hospital.

Pen Y Fan is known for being the location for the 'Fan Dance' - where soldiers hoping to join the special forces march over the mountain carrying a heavy pack and a rifle, then do the route in reverse in a set time.

L/Cpl Roberts joined the army in 2007 and served in UN operations in Cyprus and around the UK.

The former teaching assistant lived in London and had been due to start a job in the office of the Secretary of State for Education.

Tributes: This is the order of service for today's funeral

Clayton Turner broke down in tears as he shared a 'cherished memory' of the time he went diving in the Red Sea with L/Cpl Roberts in 2009.

He said his friend had told him it was a moment they would share and one that he 'would cherish for the rest of his life'.

'I know that his memories would have been full of special moments like the one I have just shared with you,' he said.

Best friend Phillip Davies told mourners that he and L/Cpl Roberts grew up together watching The Simpsons, camping, cycling and playing squash.

He said his friend was competitive but at the same time always giving 'encouragement and support to those around him'.

He said he had 'tremendous will-power and determination' and was a 'story- teller'.

Mr Davies said: 'He would always brighten up the mood and bring everyone to tears of laughter with stories of his escapades. I will miss your stories, Craig.'

He said the soldier had taught him to 'never give up', adding: 'His words made me realise that, as long as you are happy in life, nothing else matters.'

Breaking down in tears, he added: 'You will always be remembered. Craig. Goodbye.'

Another friend, Daniel Jones, said: 'I 
will never forget you, buddy. You are a one-off, a hero. But, most 
important, you were my best friend. I’ll love you always. Goodbye.'

Proud: Parents Kelvin and Margaret Roberts embraced family and friends for support

Emotional: The funeral took place with full military honours

After the tributes, the congregation applauded and the Reverend Peter Whitehead then addressed the service, paying particular tribute to L/Cpl Roberts’ 'passion'. 'determination' and positive outlook on life.

He said he was a man who loved books and was a 'thinker' who was 'mature beyond his years' and who 'brought out the best in others'.

After the tributes, the congregation 
were asked to reflect on their memories of L/Cpl Roberts as World In 
Union, sung by Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, was played.

Honours: The funeral cortege leaves Holy Trinity Church in Llandudno following the service

Tough: Pen y Fan is home to the gruelling 'Fan Dance', which involves would-be special forces personnel marching up the mountain, down the other side and back again carrying a weighted pack and rifle - then doing the route in reverse in a set time

This was followed by the hymn I Vow To Thee My Country, before the playing of the Last Post.Finally, Puccini’s Recondita Armonia was played from Tosca, one of L/Cpl Roberts’s favourite operas, and the Rudyard Kipling poem, If, was read.

Family and friends gathered outside the church for a short time to hug and comfort Mr and Mrs Roberts before the funeral cortege left, to more applause from the members of the public who had gathered outside.

The funeral was followed by a private cremation service for close family and friends at Colwyn Bay Crematorium.
