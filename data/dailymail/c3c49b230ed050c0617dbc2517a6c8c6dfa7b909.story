Songwriter: Perhaps understandably, Joe Sherman, who's best known for co-writing Nat King Cole's 1962 hit 'Ramblin' Rose,' pictured, doesn't want anything to do with Richard Winkler, who was convicted of killing the man he believed was his father in 1980

A convicted killer who spent 27 years in prison for slaying a man he thought was his father only to learn two years ago he was not is now trying to force his real 'dad' - a Grammy-nominated Manhattan composer - to take a paternity test.

Richard Winkler, 51, shot dead Irving Winkler as he slept in 1980 and served nearly three decades behind bars before his mother revealed a bombshell: Winkler wasn't actually his father, 87-year-old songwriter Joe Sherman was.

But, perhaps understandably, Sherman, who's best known for co-writing Nat King Cole's 1962 hit 'Ramblin' Rose,' didn't want anything to do with the father-killer.

Now, Winkler is trying to force Sherman to take a paternity test, after he repeatedly refused to acknowledge him as his son.

According to papers filed in Manhattan Supreme Court, Winkler says his mom, Lanie Sattler, told him for 'the very first time' in 2011 that Winkler was 'not his biological father' but Joe Sherman was.

Sattler revealed she'd gone on two dates with the songwriter and conceived Winkler on the second, allegedly at the home Sherman still lives in. When her son was three she said she'd contacted Sherman to tell him he had a son but she said he ignored her.

Sattler told her son the two men looked 'strikingly similar' so she was sure Sherman was his dad.

Winkler said he was 'dumbfounded.'

By that time he had been out of prison four years and was working as a para-legal for Skadden Arps, having earned his GED, a bachelor's degree and a master's degree behind bars.

'After much soul searching, some anger, and lots of discussion, (Winkler) decided he wanted to meet Joe Sherman,' the suit says, according to the New York Daily News.

So Winkler and his mother wrote him a letter in November 2011 but got no response. Winkler then sent a follow-up, and Sherman replied simply: 'I decline to take any DNA tests. Very truly yours, Joe Sherman.'

They tried unsuccessfully to call the now-elderly musician but Winkler did get his supposed father on the intercom when he showed up at his apartment this spring.

Contact: Winkler has repeatedly tried to contact Sherman on the phone and at his Riverside Drive, Manhattan apartment, pictured, to no avail

Sherman responded 'in a scared, shriek-like voice, "I really donâ€™t know how to handle this,"' and then hung up when Winkler suggested they meet face-to-face.

Winkler, however, was not deterred and tried several more times to contact him before receiving a letter back in May, saying, 'I really feel that there is no purpose to be served in our speaking.'

Winkler says in the petition, which he wrote himself, that Sherman 'has done everything in his power to flaunt the law and ignore plaintiff, and his mother, even to this day.'

He said he wants the 'DNA test for a myriad of reasons, but one of the key reasons is to identify whether he is predisposed to any genetic illnesses or diseases,' in addition to 'his fundamental right to know his background and heritage, and where it derives from.'

Sherman refused to comment to the New York Daily News on Monday, saying simply: 'I really don't know anything and I have no comment about it.'

Winkler acknowledges his father troubles in his petition.

'On October 24, 1980, plaintiff was arrested and accused of the murder of his father,' the papers state. 'At the time, he had just turned 19, was a high-school dropout, (and) had a host of personal issues, including a substance abuse problem.'

He also acknowledges in the suit that state law isn't on his side when it comes to forcing a paternity test as only those up to the age of 21 are allowed to seek DNA tests.

Winkler said that law's 'antiquated' and should be declared unconstitutional because it 'discriminates' against younger plaintiffs.

Sherman has, unsurprisingly, shied away from Winkler since the discovery and continually refuses to take a paternity test

Winkler is now asking a judge to order his 'real dad' to do so
