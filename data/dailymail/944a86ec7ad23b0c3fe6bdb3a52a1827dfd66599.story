The public prosecutor who oversaw the collapse of the murder case against Amanda Knox said today he would appeal against the acquittal of the American student.

'We will appeal,' said Giuliano Mignini. 'The (higher) court will decide whether to confirm the first sentence or the second sentence.'

According to the Italian judicial 
process, the prosecution cannot file its appeal until the court 
publishes a formal explanation of its decision which is expected in a few 
months.

'We will appeal,' said public prosecutor Giuliano Mignini. 'The (higher) court will decide whether to confirm the first sentence or the second sentence'

The prosecution will appeal to the Court of Cassation, Italy's highest appeals court.

Murdered: Meredith Kercher was killed just eight weeks after arriving in Italy

Mr
Mignini was speaking as Knox was pictured in London after flying in on a
British Airways flight from Rome. She is on her way home to Seattle.

The
Italian prosecutor has been heavily criticised for his handling of the 
case and his pursuit of a murder conviction against Knox, 24, and her 
former boyfriend 
Raffaele Sollecito, 27.

Meredith Kercher, a 21-year-old student from Coulsdon in Surrey, was found semi-naked with her throat slashed in a bedroom in the house she shared with Knox and two other women.

Knox and Sollecito were convicted of killing Miss Kercher in 2009. The appeals court overturned the conviction last night.

During original police questioning, Knox was questioned for more 
than 50 hours over four days. At one stage, she was quizzed by 
dozens of police for 14 hours.

She eventually named barman 
Patrick Lumumba as the killer saying she vaguely remembered 'covering my ears
in the kitchen as Patrick murdered Meredith' and as a result of that he
was arrested and spent two weeks in jail before being released.

At her appeal, the judge upheld a conviction against Knox for slander – for falsely accusing Mr Lumumba of carrying out the killing.

Knox's legal team stressed
that her 'civil rights' had been breached during the original questioning as she
had no legal representation and no official translator - she barely 
spoke Italian having arrived in the country just a few weeks earlier.

Appeals judge Claudio Pratillo Hellman will now write up a report on the decision within the next 90 days.

It
is likely to be closely examined by prosecutors to find grounds on 
which they could launch an appeal. It is unlikely to be heard until next 
year.

An appeal by the prosecutor would be 
heard by a panel of judges in Rome who would examine paperwork from the 
case and decide if there were any mistakes in the application of the law
and if it needed to be reopened.

However
Knox is not obliged to attend any potential retrial and even though 
Italy could in theory ask for her extradition, it is unlikely 
that the United States would hand her over.

Relief: Knox breaks down after being dramatically cleared of Meredith Kercher's murder

Knox's dramatic release has been widely welcomed by the U.S. media, with many journalists arguing she should never had been found guilty of Meredith Kercher's murder.

Articles written in the wake of her courtroom victory have been heavily critical of the Italian prosecutors 'far-fetched' case against her.

One has even compared her treatment to the Salem witch trials of 1692.

Prosecutor Mr Mignini had maintained Knox and Sollecito had killed 
Meredith Kercher in a bungled sex game that had gone wrong while they always insisted they were innocent.

Mr Mignini said: 'Massive mistakes 
were made by the experts and by the panel of judges at the appeal - this
is only the second stage.

'We are going to take this to the third and final level at the Supreme Court in Rome.

'The court found her guilty of slander - so why find her guilty of slander? Why did she commit the slander?

'She said that to save herself from the 
murder charge. She named Patrick Lumumba to save herself and Sollecito 
simply followed her. Wherever she goes, he goes.'

Mr Mignini also suggested that Knox's
appeal should have been stopped at the very beginning because of a 
comment made by an assistant judge, Massimo Zanetti.

Judge
Zanetti told the court at the start of the trial:'The only thing we 
know for certain is that Meredith Kercher was murdered.

Mr Mignini said: 'The judge should have 
pulled his assistant by the ears and said ''Hey you don’t do that''. In 
my opinion it shows he was not impartial.

'At that point he should not have taken part in the appeal - this is a very serious error. You don’t say things like that.

'Then another thing that also troubles us is that we saw the experts speak twice with the defence lawyers - that is not correct.

'That is why they were so hostile towards us in the trial - they should have been impartial but instead were hostile to the prosecution.'

Knox and Sollecito’s appeal victory also throws up questions surrounding the conviction of Ivory Coast drifter Rudy Guede, 24, who was found guilty of murdering and sexually assaulting Meredith and originally sentenced to 30 years which was reduced to 16 on appeal.

In his sentencing document, judges ruled that he committed the murder 'with others'.

Knox and her legal team continually questioned why Mr Mignini was allowed to carry out the prosecution after he was convicted of abuse of office.

Last year he was found guilty of illegally wire tapping phone conversations between journalists and police officers during investigations.

He was given a 16-month suspended prison sentence which he is appealing but was allowed to continue working as a prosecutor.

The family of Meredith Kercher remain stunned by the verdict and said the search for answers goes on.

Her brother Lyle, speaking at a press conference this morning, said the family was still trying to understand how a decision that 'was so certain two years ago has been so emphatically overturned'.
