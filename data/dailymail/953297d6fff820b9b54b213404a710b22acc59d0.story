When an order of Augustinian nuns realised that the nursing home they had been running in Ditchling, East Sussex, for almost 150 years no longer met modern standards, they had a stark choice: to give up caring for the frail, elderly and mentally ill or to somehow find the cash to carry on.

Ironically for an order sworn to poverty, they became property developers and hatched a multi-million-pound scheme to build a retirement village with 235 apartments, a swimming pool, restaurant and a theatre that doubles as a sports hall.

Proceeds from the sale of the new flats has enabled the nuns to build three 60-bed state-of-the-art nursing homes in the 250-acre landscaped grounds.

And the flats have proved a godsend to older buyers who want to retain their independence but give up the cost and effort of maintaining a large family home.

Peter Guggenheim, 82, and wife Peggy, 76, sold their five-bedroom Victorian home in nearby Keymer to move into a new two-bedroom apartment, and say their lives changed for the better within weeks.

‘I have noticed a great improvement in my health and confidence,’ says Peter, a former headteacher and retired magistrate, who is in the early stages of Alzheimer’s.

‘I enjoy regularly walking our dog around the beautiful traffic-free grounds.

'And we are both now meeting friends we haven’t seen in a long time. Whereas previously we postponed entertaining due to the time and energy involved, we can now share a pleasant meal in the restaurant without any hassle.’

The couple paid £360,000 for a two-bedroom apartment in the St George’s Park retirement village, whose grounds include a well-stocked fishing lake, wheelchair-friendly parks and even residents’ allotments.

The Guggenheims still have plenty of space – the living room alone is 25ft long.

‘We had 14 people here for drinks last Sunday,’ says Peggy, a former trust and estate practitioner, who knew of the development and the Augustinians’ reputation for care and hospitality.

‘Once we made the decision to downsize, I knew where I wanted us to live. I was aware of the excellent reputation of the care home at St George’s Park. I had also watched the retirement village develop and knew it offered an outstanding opportunity to live independently.’

As well as the potential of a place in one of the homes when they become frail, residents of St George’s Park can buy the services of individual carers as and when they need them. But the real emphasis is on community and convenience.

There is a shop, a gym, a hairdressing salon, a library, a snooker room and treatment rooms for visiting professionals, such as chiropodists and physiotherapists.

By day, the grand hall of the original nursing home is used for bowls and tennis, and by night it becomes a theatre or concert hall.

The village is not yet finished – a swimming pool and tennis courts are in the pipeline. Two-bedroom flats in the latest phase can be bought from £345,000.

Everywhere is accessible in a wheelchair and there are video entry phones and a sophisticated fire alarm system, while security staff monitor the whole village. The cost of the facilities, as well as sundries such as window-cleaning, is included in a monthly service charge of about £300.

The nuns manage the village and retain the freehold of the estate. Owners can be assured the Augustinian tradition of hospitality will continue, as planning permission forbids the order from selling to a commercial landlord.
