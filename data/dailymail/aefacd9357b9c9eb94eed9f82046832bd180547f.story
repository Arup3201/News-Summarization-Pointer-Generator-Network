Chris Kyle's brother on Thursday said he wishes 'idiot' killer Eddie Ray Routh had faced the death penalty  - but that he could not bear to prolong the agony of the trial.

'Of course I'd like the guy dead right now,' Jeff Kyle said as he appeared on Fox & Friends two days after Routh was found guilty of murdering the famed U.S. Navy SEAL and his friend in 2013.

'From what we understand, we'd still be going through the trial right now. We'd probably still be going through the jury selection if they'd been going for the death penalty.'

Prosecutors had not sought the death penalty in the case and Routh will now serve life without parole for the murders of Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield at a Texas shooting range.

Relief: Jeff Kyle, the brother of slain sniper Chris Kyle, appeared on Fox & Friends on Thursday and said he was relieved that Eddie Ray Routh was found guilty of murder - but that he wishes he was dead

Attorneys had been placed under a gagging order at the time Erath County District Attorney Alan Nash said he would not seek the death penalty and so did not release detail about their decision.

But  Andrea Lyon, a defense attorney and dean of the law school at Valparaiso University, told the Associated Press at the time it was 'presumably because they thought it wouldn't stick'.

Speaking on Fox on Thursday, Jeff Kyle, 37, said he was relieved that the jury had rejected Routh's claims that he was mentally ill when he shot dead the men dead.

'Just for the simple fact that this idiot murdered my brother and Chad and now he's going to spend the rest of his life paying for it,' Kyle said.

He also spoke of his frustration that Routh had blamed the killings on PTSD and mental illness. Defense witnesses had said Routh showed signs of schizophrenia and psychosis.

'He's not crazy,' Kyle said. 'He was always hopped up on drugs - that's not crazy.'

Guilty: Former Marine Eddie Ray Routh, 27, now faces life in prison without parole after a jury in Stephenville, Texas found him guilty of murder on Tuesday. The jury rejected the defense's claims he was mentally ill

Kyle said that the nine-day trial was 'grueling' for the family but that they were infinitely thankful for the support they had received.

'It's huge to know that everybody - not just Texans and not just people in the U.S. - people all over the world [are] in support of it,' he said.

Routh was unemotional as he was found guilty of the two murders on Tuesday evening, little more than two hours after the jury started deliberating.

Speaking on Wednesday, jurors said they had 'no doubt' that Routh knew right from wrong when he shot the men dead on February 2, 2013 before he fled in Kyle's pick-up truck.

'He knew the consequences of pulling the trigger,' juror Barrett Hutchison said on Good Morning America as he appeared alongside several other jurors.

Juror Kristina Yager added that Routh routinely claimed he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder from his time serving overseas in Iraq and Haiti when he got into trouble with the law.

Thankful: Kyle's widow Taya, pictured leaving court on Tuesday, wrote on Facebook on Wednesday that she was thankful for the jury's decision as she paid tribute to Chris as 'the love of my life'

'Every time something bad happened, he pulled that card,' Yager said.

His family and friends had testified how Routh returned from abroad a changed man who was reliant on marijuana and alcohol, and who often had bouts of paranoia that sent him to VA hospitals.

But the prosecution argued that he was under the influence of drugs at the time of the killing and an expert witness testified Routh was faking his mental illness.

On Thursday, Chris Kyle's widow Taya Kyle, who gave emotional testimony at the trial, thanked the jury for its decision as she paid tribute to her husband on Facebook.

'God Bless the Jury And good people of Stephenville, Texas!!' she wrote.

'Chris, you are the love of my life. You live on in my heart. You always will. I hope we all live lives that make you proud. And babe, Rest assured you don't need a fancy resting place – you live on… Safe In the hearts you left behind.'
