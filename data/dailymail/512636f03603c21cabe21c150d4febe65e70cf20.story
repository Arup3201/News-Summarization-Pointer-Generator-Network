They are a breathtaking visualisation of just how quickly our planet is changing.

Google has released these astonishing images showing data collected from the Landsat satellite from 1982 until 2012.

They reveal everything from man's impact on the desert as Las Vegas expands to the retreat of glaciers in Columbia.

the world appear as islands off the coast as vast swathes of 
construction are undertaken

Each
 frame of the timelapse map is constructed from a year of Landsat 
satellite data, constituting an annual 1.7-terapixel snapshot of the 
Earth at 30-meter resolution.

The Landsat program, managed by the USGS, has been acquiring images of 
the Earth's surface since 1972. Landsat provides critical scientific 
information about our changing planet.

Google worked with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Nasa and Time to develop the images, even digitising tapes containing the early data from the satellites.

'Today, we're making it possible for you to go back in time and get a stunning historical perspective on the changes to the Earth’s surface over time,' said Rebecca Moore, an Engineering Manager at Google.

'Working with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), NASA and TIME, we're releasing more than a quarter-century of images of Earth taken from space, compiled for the first time into an interactive time-lapse experience.

'We believe this is the most comprehensive picture of our changing planet ever made available to the public.'

The Columbia Glacier in Alaska retreating can clearly be seen in the first of the stunning timelapse images

Google selected a range of images for
 the project, from the sprouting of Dubai’s artificial Palm Islands, the
 retreat of Alaska’s Columbia Glacier, the deforestation of the 
Brazilian Amazon to urban growth in Las Vegas from 1984 to 2012:

The images were collected as part of an ongoing joint mission between the USGS and NASA called Landsat.

Their
 satellites have been observing earth from space since the 1970s - with 
all of the images sent back to Earth and archived on USGS tape drives.

Watch as the Saudi Arabian desert becomes irrigated and crop circles sprout throughout the terrain

'We started working with the USGS in 2009 to make this historic archive of earth imagery available online,' said Miss Moore.

'Using Google Earth Engine technology, we sifted through 2,068,467 images—a total of 909 terabytes of data—to find the highest-quality pixels (e.g., those without clouds), for every year since 1984 and for every spot on Earth.

The Landsat satellite imagery documents the loss of Amazonian forest land in Brazil due to road-building, logging and agricultural clearing

'We then compiled these into enormous planetary images, 1.78 terapixels each, one for each year.

'As
 the final step, we worked with the Create Lab at Carnegie Mellon 
University, recipients of a Google Focused Research Award, to convert 
these annual Earth images into a seamless, browsable HTML5 animation.'

The astonishing rate of urban development has spread out around Nevada's biggest city over the decades

Google says the maps are 'profound images'.

'Much
 like the iconic image of Earth from the Apollo 17 mission - which had a
 profound effect on many of us - his time-lapse map is not only 
fascinating to explore, but we also hope it can inform the global 
community’s thinking about how we live on our planet and the policies 
that will guide us in the future.

A special thanks to all our partners who helped us to make this happen.'

Iran's great salt lake Urmia drying up. The Iranian government blames climate change and 
drought for the dramatic changes, while critics blame the dams that have been built around the 
lake

The maps use Google's Earth Engine, which brings together the world's satellite imagery, with trillions of scientific measurements dating back almost 40 years.

Google has made it available online with tools for scientists, independent researchers, and nations.

the search giant says it hopes the resource will allow people to 'mine this massive warehouse of data to detect changes, map trends and quantify differences on the Earth's surface.'

Mines spread across the surface of Wyoming., making the Black Thunder mine in Wyoming's Powder River Basin the largest single coal mining complex in the world

Opened in 1977, Black Thunder is the second most productive mine in the United States, providing the U.S. with eight percent of its coal supply
