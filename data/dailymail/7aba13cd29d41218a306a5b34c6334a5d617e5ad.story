Theresa May is emerging as a ‘Stop Boris’ candidate for the Tory leadership if the party fails to win the next election.

Allies insisted she would do nothing to undermine David Cameron during this Parliament.However, they conceded she could be the leading candidate to prevent London Mayor Boris Johnson winning a future contest, should the Tories not win the next election and Mr Cameron steps down.

The steely Home Secretary – dubbed ‘Britain’s Angela Merkel’ by supporters – looked livid yesterday as Ed Miliband mentioned mounting speculation about her leadership ambitions at Prime Minister’s Questions.

Unamused: Home Secretary Theresa May sits stony-faced as Ed Miliband teases her about becoming Tory leader in opposition. She was sat next to Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, who has been tipped as her Chancellor

It has been suggested that Mrs May 
could exploit an emerging alliance with Defence Secretary Philip Hammond
to run on a ‘Top Gear ticket’ of ‘May and Hammond’, named after the 
presenters of the BBC show.

Both are resisting further cuts in their departments as Chancellor George Osborne embarks on a new spending review.

Increasing numbers of women Tory MPs 
are backing the Home Secretary as a potential leader, as are some 
Right-wing men impressed with her command of the Home Office, 
traditionally a political graveyard.

The Spectator magazine has named 
former Cabinet ministers Cheryl Gillan and Caroline Spelman, education 
minister Edward Timpson and parliamentary aide George Hollingbery as 
among those helping to position her for a future campaign.

Speculation in Westminster has been 
heightened after Mrs May started inviting MPs to open ‘tearoom 
surgeries’ each Wednesday after Prime Minister’s Questions.

During PMQs Labour leader Ed Miliband turned his attention to Mrs May, who was sat on the government frontbench, and her ambitions to replace David Cameron

Theresa May was born on October 1, 1956, in 
Eastbourne, Sussex. Her father was a Church of England clergyman.

Before attending a grammar school, she was
educated at a state primary, independent convent and state secondary 
schools.

On completion of her studies at school, she attended the University of Oxford where she read Geography. 

Before entering national politics, she worked at the Bank of England and also as a financial consultant. She 
was also a London councillor.

May was first elected to Parliament in 1997 as an MP for Maidenhead.

Before becoming a senior minister, she served in a variety of roles in the Shadow Cabinets of Iain Duncan Smith, Michael Howard and also current Prime Minister David Cameron.

During her time on the opposition benches, she was Shadow Leader of the House of Commons and Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. 

Following Cameron's appointment as Prime Minister in May 2010, she was appointed Home Secretary and Minister for Women and Equalities. However, she gave up the latter role in 2012.

‘Theresa is quietly showing the rest 
of them how it’s done,’ one minister said. ‘She’s got immigration and 
crime down, pushed through the most radical police reform for a 
generation with barely a ripple, her command of detail is Thatcherite 
and she has shown real bravery on issues like [the extradition of 
computer hacker] Gary McKinnon. Dismiss her at your peril.’

However, another MP said of the 
prospect of a ‘dream ticket’ of Mrs May and Mr Hammond: ‘They are both 
brilliant but you might say anything approaching a light touch is 
lacking.’

Allies insisted Mrs May, who flirted 
with a leadership run in 2005, was unhappy at the focus on her ambitions
and said the idea that she was plotting against Mr Cameron in any way 
was ‘ridiculous’.

‘She and David Cameron get on 
enormously well,’ said one supporter. ‘She has complete faith in him and
he has complete faith in her. David Cameron is not going anywhere and 
anyone who thinks so is mad.

‘But she is not a great fan of Boris.
She thinks he is a faintly ridiculous figure who changes his mind every
five minutes.

Nobody knows what he would want to do with the country 
other than be the most famous person in it. 2015 is a long way away.

She
is a serious person and she will make her decision when and if there is
a decision to be made.’

Another MP who is sympathetic to the 
idea of Mrs May as a future leader pointed out that she could help 
address the Tories’ huge poll deficit among women.

In the Commons, a glacial Mrs May sat
next to Mr Hammond as Mr Miliband attempted to tease her about the 
prospect of them clashing over the Despatch Box once she becomes leader.

The Labour leader joked: ‘I’m looking forward to facing her when they are in opposition.’
