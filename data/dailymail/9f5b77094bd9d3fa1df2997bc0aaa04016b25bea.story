Jose Mourinho's recent fury at referees reached new heights this weekend in Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Burnley  - and by coincidence the man who helped set it all off will be back in the Chelsea boss' firing line at Wembley on Sunday.

Anthony Taylor - the man who booked Cesc Fabregas for diving  in Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Southampton in December - is the referee for the Capital One Cup final that pits Chelsea against Tottenham.

The 36-year-old official apologised to Mourinho for his mistake after the Portuguese coach slammed Taylor and said he would be 'ashamed' of the decision.

The Special One also said that a campaign had been started against his Chelsea players after the latest in a string of allegations that they were prone to cheating - comments that led to a £25,000 fine from the FA.

'It is a scandal,' Mourinho said at the time. 'I think it is clearly the result of something that looks like a campaign.

'We lose two points in a match where the penalty is there and Fabregas gets a yellow card.

'The reality there are penalties and penalties - this one was a huge one. It was not just a small penalty. It was a penalty like Big Ben. In other countries this is front-page news because it's an absolute scandal.

'Match after match coaches are telling Chelsea players are diving. I will go to the referee and wish him a good year and tell him he will be ashamed.'

Mourinho spoke out again on his perceived injustice on Sunday in an interview with Goals on Sunday after Nemanja Matic was sent off for reacting to a bad tackle from Ashley Barnes - potentially risking his place at the showpiece at Wembley Stadium.

'The problem is the incidents I'm speaking about and probably now I'm risking my dugout in the final,' he said. 'Maybe tomorrow I have the risk of being suspended because I'm having this conversation.'
