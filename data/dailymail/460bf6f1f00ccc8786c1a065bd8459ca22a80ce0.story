Survivor: Traute Rankin, 74, lived in woodland for nearly a month after vanishing from her home

A 74-year-old woman survived for nearly a month in a Florida wood, by eating granola bars and drinking from discarded soda bottles.

Traute Rankin, who was reported missing on May 2, was finally found on Saturday after she collapsed by the side of a road as she tried to get help.

The 74-year-old, who is in the early stages of dementia and was suffering from paranoia, was severely dehydrated when she was spotted in bushes.

Ms Rankin had created a makeshift camp for herself, with a blanket spread out under a palm tree, and a pillow created from a plastic bag filled with leaves.

Granola bar wrappers and empty soda bottles were also found discarded around the section of woodland she had been living in.

The elderly woman's daughter, Renee Shelley, told Click Orlando that her mother had survived by drinking the remnants of liquid from soda bottles discarded along a nearby road.

'When she couldn't find anymore of 
those, she tried to walk to Walmart, but she was so dehydrated, she 
collapsed before she got there,' Ms Shelley said.

She added that her mother, who was found on Saturday, suffered from mental health issues that had caused her to become frightened and leave her apartment complex.

After spending a couple of days in woodland, which was near her home, it is believed Ms Rankin became too scared to return to her home on a 55 and older estate.

Supplies: Discarded soda bottles, which Rankin had collected from a nearby road, were found in her camp

'She does have some paranoia issues. I'm assuming she was scared that she knew in her mind that someone was looking for her,' Ms Shelley told the Orlando Sentinel.

Relief: Renee Shelley had been searching for her mother since May 2

Her mother told her she had been trying to walk to Walmart when she turned off her usual path and went down an embankment and into the woods.

Ms Rankin had left her cell phone at home on the day she disappeared, but did have a few granola bars in her purse.

Police had been searching for Ms Rankin since her family reported her missing on May 2, and even used helicopters to try to spot her.

Ms Shelley had been in the process of moving home when her mother disappeared.

When she was found, she was close to the parking lot of the Walmart she had been trying to reach, so she could get a drink.

'She was a little bit confused when they found her,' police captain Rob HIcks said.

He said although there was no evidence of abuse or criminal activity, police were fully investigating Ms Rankin's case.

The 74-year-old, who was severely dehydrated and covered in bug bites, is still recovering in hospital.
