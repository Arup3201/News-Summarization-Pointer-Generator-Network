It took more than a year to build but only seconds to raze to the ground.

This is the explosive moment a peaceful spring morning was shattered as three massive cooling towers and a giant chimney were obliterated during a controlled demolition.

The structures at the Richborough Power Station, near Sandwich, Kent, were brought crashing to the ground in just 21 seconds.

Demolition: The final cooling tower, which has stood for more than 50 years, then falls, all shown in a sensational video

Its 318ft (97m) cooling towers where reduced to rubble before the single 416ft (127m) chimney stack crumbled to the floor at 9am yesterday morning.

Thousands of onlookers gathered to watch the series of thundering explosions.

Among those to witness the destruction
of this local landmark was 83-year-old John Jones who helped build the 
largest chimney between 1960 and 1961.

Bang: The first of the cooling Towers is shown tumbling downwards as part of the controlled demolition

Dramatic: The second of the three cooling towers is seen falling by thousands of spectators

The great-grandfather said: 'It was 
the hardest construction job I had ever been on. We worked seven days a 
week mostly, putting in ten hour days and sometimes more, for a year.'

The demolition was carried out by Holly Benett, who is believed to be the only female explosives engineer in the UK.

Some locals had campaigned to keep the towers saying they formed part of the historical landscape and were used as a navigation point by fishermen.

But the iconic buildings that had dominated the Kent skyline for more than 50 years where brought down to make way for a green energy park.

Gone: In just 21 seconds the power station is completely obliterated

Charges, placed around the bottom of each tower, were ignited by a remote detonator causing the buildings to crumble at their bases before dramatically fold in on themselves.

The power station has regularly been used as a film location and most recently appeared in the 2008 film 'Son of Rambow'.

It was built by the Central Electricity Generating Board and started in the late 1950s.

Gary Lever, development director for BFL Management Ltd who now own the site said: 'The demolition of the cooling towers and chimney represents an important landmark in this project which will allow the site to be brought back into productive use for the first time in nearly 15 years.'
