Two innocent men who were wrongly convicted of murder in North Carolina and imprisoned for a total of 31 years have received $12.475 million from the state's Bureau of Investigation.

Floyd Brown, a mentally disabled man locked up for 14 years, will receive $7.85 million for being falsely imprisoned, while Greg Taylor, who was held for 17 years, is to get $4.625 million.

The payouts come as yet more embarrassment for the agency, which also settled with a man in 2009 after he wrongly spent nine years on death row - and Taylor said his hefty payout shows the State Bureau of Investigation is admitting it made a mistake.

Brown, who has an IQ of 50, was held in a psychiatric hospital for the murder of Katherine Lynch, a retired schoolteacher who was found beaten to death in her home in 1993.

Witnesses said her killer was African-American, and officers pulled in Brown for questioning, although he did not resemble the suspect.

No evidence tied him to the case and shortly after it was tested, sheriff's deputies lost nearly all of the physical evidence, the Charlotte Observer reported.

Nevertheless, he was locked up after an SBI agent produced a six-page confession after interrogating Brown. His attorneys said the details were too elaborate for Brown to have given.

Moving on: Brown was never given a trial as it was deemed he did not have the mental competency deemed necessary to stand trial. He is now living with a caretaker and enjoys trips to Burger King

Thrown out: The only evidence linking Brown, who has an IQ of 50, to the crime was a confession he allegedly gave investigators during an interrogation. A judge ruled this was not enough to prove his guilt

Brown, who has the mental capacity of
a seven-year-old, was never brought before a jury as he did not have 
the mental competency to stand trail. He was sent to Dorothea Dix Hospital in Raleigh.

But in 2007, he was freed by Durham County Superior Court Judge Orlando Hudson, who determined Brown's confession was not enough to prove he had killed Lynch.

He now lives with a caretaker. His attorney, David Rudolf, said Brown likes Burger King and cleaning and asked to ride in a BMW when he returned home.

His caretaker now drives him around in a used BMW 525, Rudolf said. He also enjoys just sitting behind the wheel of the parked car.

Greg Taylor was in his 20s when he was jailed for the beating death of Jacquetta Thomas, who was found bludgeoned and abandoned in a cul-de-sac in East Raleigh in 1991.

The father-of-one spent 17 years locked 
up in North Carolina prisons until a three-judge panel declared him 
innocent in 2010. During the hearing, witnesses went back on their 
original statements.

It came after he was represented by an independent commission concerned with cases of people who maintained their innocence.

During
the hearing, it emerged that an SBI lab report said officers found 
blood in Taylor's truck. But a subsequent test showed it was not human 
blood - and these results were never reported by the agent. It had been 
the only physical evidence allegedly linking him to the crime.

Since
being freed, he has tried to settle back into a normal routine with 
visits to the gym and to his grandsons. When he was locked up, he left 
behind a daughter, who is now married with two children.

Last year, he told WRAL: 'You just can't undo 17 years in two years, or even five years, maybe. You don't have any future with a life sentence, so you just kind of give up all those hopes, all those aspirations.

'If I was hopeful of anything today, I would be hopeful to find some purpose for what I've been through. I'm trying to learn how to be 50 years old when my mind still thinks I'm 30.'

Taylor told the Observer he was now looking to the future, but added that the state agreeing to settleÂ  is an indication that they wronged him.

'The fact that 
they settled speaks for itself,' he said, adding he will live on the money and use some for a safety net for his daughter and her family.

Freed: Brown was held at a psychiatric hospital, Dorothea Dix Hospital, for 14 years before he was released

Attorney General Roy 
Cooper has not acknowledged any wrongdoing by his agents but said it was 
an opportunity to look forward, thanks to better interrogation methods 
and lab techniques.

In the aftermath of the exoneration, 
Duane Deaver, the SBI agent whose misconduct was central to the ruling, 
was fired for his actions in other cases.

Special Agent Mark Isley, who was involved in Brown's case, is still employed as a supervisor at the SBI on a salary of $86,215.

The settlements are not the first large payouts stemming from SBI misconduct, the Charlotte Observer reported.

In 2009, the SBI and its insurers agreed to pay $3.9 million to Alan Gell, who mistakenly spent nine years on death row for a murder he did not commit.
