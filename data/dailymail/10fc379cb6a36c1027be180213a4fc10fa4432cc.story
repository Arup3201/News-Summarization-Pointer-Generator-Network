A baby died in a gap between her bed and a radiator, an inquest has heard.

Tilly Fitzpatrick was three months old when she got stuck and over-heated in her bedroom in Chelsea, south west London, last September.

Her mother, Louise, left Tilly and her twin sister with their father, Timothy Clark, while she went shopping.

When she tried to contact him he failed to answer the phone so she returned to the house where she knocked on he door and woke him after he fell asleep in the lounge.

She wept as she told West London Coroner's Court that Tilly had 'definitely been moved' from between pillows on the bed - possibly when her two-year-old son, Reilly, had gone looking for toys.

Ms Fitzpatrick said: 'He came at about 9am, or 9.30am. I had fed Tilly and winded her and I went into the living room where Tim was feeding Megan and I said "you're going to be fine aren't you?" and he said "yes".

'Tilly was in the bed in the master bedroom. I'd put a pillow to the left and one to the right of her so she couldn't move.'

She went out shopping with her son Jaden but became alarmed when at 11.30am her ex, Mr Clark, stopped answering her call and she returned home just before 2pm.

Sobbing, Ms Fitzpatrick added: 'When I went into the block I just had this gut feeling that something was wrong and I grabbed Jaden and ran up the stairs.

'I was knocking at the door for what felt like forever. When he opened the door, I could tell that he had just woken up.

'When I looked in the bedroom I couldn't see Tilly at all, and by this time I was shouting at him "Where's Tilly?".

'When I went back into the bedroom I just saw a pink vest and then saw her down the side of the bed.

'I was just screaming and before I knew it Tim was telling me how to resuscitate her from what they were telling him on the phone, and then the next thing I remember is my dad coming in.'

Paramedics rushed the baby to hospital where she was briefly revived before being pronounced dead.

Ms Fitzpatrick told the inquest: 'She was definitely moved. There is no way she could have moved from where I left her, she was only three months old.

'After she died I thought about this all the time. How did she get there? I don't know what happened but I don't think Tim hurt her - there's no possible way.

'I believe that if she hadn't got down the side of the bed she would still be here.'

Mr Clark told the inquest he had last checked on Tilly at about 1pm, but then he fell asleep while feeding her twin sister in the living room and watching cartoons with his two-year-old son Reilly.

He said: 'There's no way she could have moved from between the pillows.

'Reilly was two at the time and the door to the bedroom was a little bit open so I could hear her [Tilly].

'He goes in there sometimes to get his toys so he might have gone in there.'

A post-mortem revealed Tilly had been starved of oxygen and must have lain face down for up to an hour after her death.

Coroner Miss Alison Thompson turned to devastated mum Louise Fitzpatrick and said: 'Mothers always have to leave their babies at some point. You can't stay with them forever, nobody would expect you to.'

The coroner said she was satisfied that Tilly was left on the bed in 'an entirely safe position' and that the tot had suffocated after becoming wedged.

Recording a short narrative verdict, she added: 'Tilly was a well-nourished and healthy child with no underlying medical conditions that contributed to her death.

'When she was found, the majority of her body was lower than the mattress and her face was pressed against the side of the mattress. Ms Fitzpatrick later found a wet patch on the mattress there.

'I have heard evidence that [Mr Clark] had had a late night and I'm satisfied that it was nearer to two hours since he last checked on Tilly.

'Someone had been responsible for directly or indirectly moving her and I have heard that it could have been merely a bounce on the bed.

'She must have been moved into a different position but with no specific intention to harm her.'

Miss Thompson recorded that Tilly died when she was left on an adult bed without supervision, and that the medical cause of death was postural asphyxia.
