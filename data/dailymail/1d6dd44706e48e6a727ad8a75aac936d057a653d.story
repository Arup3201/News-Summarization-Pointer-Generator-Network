Luke Shaw is yet to feature for Manchester United under Louis van Gaal but Jonny Evans has seen enough of the 19-year-old summer signing to believe he'll be a world beater. 

Evans was at the heart of Van Gaal's first victorious back four alongside Rafael, Tyler Blackett and another new signing, Marcos Rojo, in their 4-0 win over QPR, but while on the bench Shaw wasn't called upon by the Dutch boss. When he is though, Evans says he'll be something special.

'I had the chance to work with Luke in pre-season and there is no doubt he is going to be the best left-back in the world,' Northern Irishman Evans told United Review of his teenage team-mate.

Shaw' start to life at Manchester United has included being told he was unfit by Louis van Gaal and injury

Shaw appeared for United during their pre-season tour of the United States, following his £27million move from Southampton, but was soon told by Van Gaal that he needed to get. 

He was then struck down with a hamstring strain and has since featured only on the bench for his new club. 

Evans, turning the attention to his end of the park when so much of the talk about United has centered on their star-studded attackers - including new signings Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao - was also impressed by the work of versatile Marcos Rojo on debut.

'I watched Marcos at the World Cup and thought he was excellent for Argentina whether he played at left-back or left wing-back - and he can play centre-back too,' he said.
