The Plebgate cabinet minister had a history of arguing with police - and once called an officer 'a little s***', according to court papers.

MP Andrew Mitchell is suing the owner of a newspaper which alleged he called officers ‘plebs’ during a now-infamous argument at the gates of Downing Street in central London in September 2012.

But media firm News Group Newspapers claims in papers filed at the High Court that the 58-year-old former international development secretary had a seven-year history of rude and abusive behaviour.

It even alleges he called an officer a ‘little s***’ when asked to stop while approaching a barrier at a Palace of Westminster entrance in 2005, reported Independent on Sunday journalist Jamie Merrill.

Mr Mitchell allegedly told the officer: ‘I’m a Member of Parliament and I’m too important to stop for you’. The officer stated in response that he ‘didn’t care’ who Mr Mitchell was.

However the MP is said to have then replied to the officer: ‘Stop being so aggressive, you little s***.’

More than 12 incidents from 2005 to 2012 have been claimed to have occurred in the court papers, including one where Mr Mitchell could not produce the correct identification to enter Downing Street.

He also would not allow his car to be searched when arriving at the Palace of Westminster on one occasion, according to today’s newspaper report.

Assistance: Mr Mitchell twice relied on fellow Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith (pictured) to help him gain entry to Downing Street, it is claimed

The court papers also claim that Mr Mitchell twice relied on fellow Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith to help him gain entry to Downing Street after confrontations with police officers.

He also allegedly said while in Kenya three years ago that he ‘should be treated like royalty’ – and embarked on a ‘foul-mouthed tirade’ over the actions of his police protection officers.

It comes after the Metropolitan Police published documents earlier this month summarising an inquiry into the aftermath of the incident, which resulted in four police officers being sacked.

And it released new CCTV footage of the heated disagreement involving Mr Mitchell. In the incident, Mr Mitchell has denied he used the word 'pleb' - but apologised for swearing. He announced his resignation in October 2012.

The report also unearthed details of his previous altercations with police in Downing Street.

A former head of security and business continuity at No 10 said there were two incidents dating back to 2011 when the Tory MP swore about not being allowed through a rear entrance.

The case between Mr Mitchell and News Group Newspapers - owner of The Sun newspaper - is due before the High Court in November.

Mr Mitchell’s lawyer, Graham Atkins, told The Independent On Sunday: ‘Mr Mitchell’s amended reply is shortly to be filed at court and this responds to each allegation in detail.’
