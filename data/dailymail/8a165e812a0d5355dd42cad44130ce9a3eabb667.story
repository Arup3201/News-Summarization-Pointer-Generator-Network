Maurice Edu has completed a permanent move from Stoke to Major League Soccer side Philadelphia Union.

The 28-year-old United States international midfielder spent the recent MLS season on loan to Philadelphia, making 31 appearances.

With the guarantee of regular football, Edu has wasted no time in signing a full-time contract with Union.

It brings to an end his nightmare time with Stoke with whom he made a single substitute appearance lasting nine minutes following a move from Rangers in August 2012.

'Mo is an extremely important player to our organization and we're excited that he will be in Philadelphia for the foreseeable future,' Union technical director Chris Albright said.

'We look forward to him helping lead us toward building a winning team.'
