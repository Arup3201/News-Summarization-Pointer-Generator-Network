For children of the 1970s and early 1980s, no Saturday afternoon was complete without watching Big Daddy and Giant Haystacks wrestle each other to the ground in front of a hysterical live audience.

Adult wrestling was considered prime family entertainment, and girls and boys sat transfixed as the 26-stone, leotard-clad Big Daddy (real name: Shirley Crabtree) led the crowd with chants of 'Easy, easy' before demolishing his opponent with his trademark 'Splash', which involved felling them with his stomach in (often carefully choreographed) violent bouts.

The frightening-looking Giant Haystacks was his arch rival, and at 48 stone, quite some opponent, and most children, as well as the Queen and Margaret Thatcher, who both declared themselves fans, knew whose side they were on.  The masked wrestler Kendo Nagasaki (aka Peter Thornley) was another household name who rose to such prominence that his 1977 unmasking ceremony was televised (though Big Daddy had managed the same feat two years earlier).

The wrestling bouts were filmed in front of live audiences at venues around the country, and, as this collection of old posters which have just come to light show, lucky residents of towns around Britain chosen to host the bouts could buy a ticket for as little as £1 to see their heroes fight each other live.

Clash of the super-heavyweights: Big Daddy pitting his 26-stone, leotard-clad body against 48-stone rival Giant Haystacks was top family entertainment in the 70s and 80s

Big Daddy became a household name known for his glitzy costumes (his wife, Eunice, made his first leotard out of their chintz sofa cover) and vast, rippling stomach

No holds barred: Big Daddy, pictured above left, usually played the good guy while Haystacks, pictured left and against Steve Earl, right, would often be jeered

Big draw: The wrestlers performed in front of live audiences and locals could buy ringside seats and join Big Daddy in chanting 'Easy, easy' as he took his rivals down

Essential weekend viewing: As this copy of the TV Times from June 1971 shows, wrestling was a regular one-hour slot on ITV's Saturday afternoon schedule

People would flock to venues around the country to watch live wrestling featuring stars such as Mick McManus, left, who was known as a villain who bent the rules

Wrestling posters such as these were a common sight in the 1970s and 1980s, and the sport's stars became huge stars - the Queen and Margaret were both fans

Political correctness was a long way off in the 1970s when a night out watching some of the most famous sportsmen of the day could cost as little as 75p

The wrestling stars built up characters for themselves with trademark costumes, catchphrases and moves - Big Daddy's was his notorious Big Splash jump

For more of the British wrestling superstars, bigger was better - those with particularly large stomachs were feared in the ring, but others concentrated on muscles

Women wrestlers, such as Klondyke Kate, left, were popular too, and the biggest stars filled the biggest arenas, with Big Daddy taking on Giant Haystacks at Wembley
