Kelly Kociela leaving Bristol Magistrates' Court after biting a teacher while trying to pick her children up from school

A mother who bit a teacher after turning up drunk at her children's school has been banned from entering the playground.

Kelly Kociela, 32, had drunk lager and rum before arriving at Filton Avenue Junior and Infant School in Horfield, Bristol ‘distressed and slurring,’ the town's magistrates' court heard.

Kociela was held back by teachers as she tried to push her way into a school building to reach her children at an after-school club. When teacher Matthew Cox tried to block her path, she bit him on the arm.

The court heard how Mr Cox then went to hospital and was given precautionary tetanus and hepatitis B injections after the attack at 6pm on October 24 last year.

Kociela, of Horfield, Bristol, was arrested and taken to Southmead police station where she told officers that she had drunk three or four pints of Stella and four rum and cokes before she argued with her partner and decided to collect her children.

She told police she could not remember being at the school, that she normally got on with headteacher Rachel Thomas and could not remember biting Mr Cox.

She pleaded guilty to a charge of causing a nuisance on school premises, assault and using threatening words and behaviour on a previous occasion.

Mary Aquilina, prosecuting, said Kociela turned up at the school demanding to see her two children.

Ms Aquilina said: ‘She was aggravated and aggressive saying her children had been taken from her.

‘The headteacher Rachel Thomas was concerned about the safety of her staff and the children at her school.’

Kociela then went to the after-school 
club threatening Mrs Thomas that if she did not give her her children, 
she would ‘batter’ her, Ms Aquilina said.

On her arrival at the after-school club doors Mr Cox put his arm across the door to block her entry.

Ms Aquilina said: ‘She tried to push past him, then bit him through his clothing on his right arm. He attended Southmead Hospital where he was given tetanus and hepatitis B jabs.’

Liz Highams, defending, said her client immediately rang the school after the incident to apologise for her behaviour but was currently banned from going on the premises.

The court heard that Kociela had stopped drinking and was ‘mortified’ by her behaviour that day.

Miss Highams said the reporting of 
the matter in the press had caused her and her children a great deal of 
stress describing it as ‘more than damaging’.

Magistrates
handed Kociela a two-year community order and she was ordered to pay 
£100 compensation to Mr Cox, £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge. 

Kociela may only go to the school if invited but can collect her children from the school gates.

The
court also heard that Kociela had previous convictions for being drunk 
in charge of a child in 2005, 2006, 2007 and earlier this year.
