More than 750 schools are failing to give pupils a good grounding in the Three Rs - reading, writing and arithmetic.

A child's chance of getting a good primary education still varies markedly depending on where they live, official statistics showed today.

Ministers insisted it was the result of tougher targets to improve the quality of lessons in England, and stressed that the gap between poorer pupils and their classmates is narrowing.

In some areas of England, the vast majority of youngsters gain a Level 4 - the standard expected of 11-year-olds in the Three Rs. But in other areas, up to three in 10 fail to reach this target.

Overall, the proportion of primaries failing to ensure pupils reach a good standard in three Rs has remained static this year, despite schools facing tougher Government targets.

More than 700 schools in England are considered below the floor standard, the same proportion as last year, according to a Government analysis of data used to create primary school league tables.

Schools minister David Laws said the findings show schools have 'raised their game', but warned there are still too many areas with 'simply unacceptable' levels of attainment for poorer pupils.

Schools that fail to meet the benchmark - based on national curriculum test results at age 11 and pupil progress - are considered under-performing and at risk of being turned into an academy, or taken over by a different sponsor or trust if they already have academy status.

The Department for Education's analysis shows wide variations across the country, with no schools under-performing in some areas while in others, significant proportions are below the Government's target. In one area, more than a quarter of primaries are considered to be under the threshold.

Under the Government's tougher standards, schools must ensure at least 65 per cent of 11-year-olds reach Level 4 - the standard expected of the age group - in reading, writing and maths, and meet national averages in pupil progress.

Children working at Level 4 are considered able to spell, use joined-up handwriting, are beginning to use complex sentences, can calculate simple fractions and percentages and can multiply and divide whole numbers by 10 and 100.

Overall, 768 schools failed to meet the floor standard this year, compared with 767 last year, the DfE said.

The new rankings are based on the performance of around 16,000 primaries in national curriculum tests - known as Sats - in reading and maths, as well as teacher assessments of pupils' writing skills.

The results also show the top primary school again this year, based on average points score, was Fox Primary School in Kensington and Chelsea, west London.

Overall, 79 per cent of 11-year-olds achieved the expected standard in all three areas this year, up three percentage points
