Taylor Swift brought untold joy to her newly-discovered doppelganger yesterday when she shared a snap of the lookalike fan on her Tumblr page.

'Lol I thought that was me,' the 25-year-old songstress wrote along with the post, which is of Morgan Jensen, a young model and graphic designer from Flagstaff, Arizona, who idolizes Taylor and occasionally impersonates her outside her concerts.

'When I saw [Taylor] had re-blogged [shared] it I screamed and threw my phone and for the next six hours after that I was an ugly mess,' Morgan told Cosmopolitan. 'Taylor is everything and the fact that she saw my face and thought it looked like hers - I died!'

The original photo of Morgan was posted by her friend Kasey to her blog NeverGoOutOfStyle, and pictures the blogger posing with the lookalike blonde, who is sporting the same style of crimson lipstick and black sunglasses often modeled by Taylor herself.

'When your best friend looks like Taylor swift you have to take 100 selfies,' Kacey captioned the image, before it was re-blogged by Taylor. 

Morgan says she often gets compared to her favorite popstar, remarking that both are 'tall and lanky', and even revealed that she once commanded a two-hour line of fans who wanted their photos taken with her outside Taylor's Nashville concert in 2013.

The pretty blonde, who has a boyfriend, has appeared in several modeling shoots in the past, one for New York-based agency Ford Models. 

Since Taylor publicly acknowledged her lookalike, Kacey's blog has attracted a swarm of internet attention, and she is currently trying to arrange a real-life meeting between Morgan and Taylor.

Given Taylor's well-proven dedication to her fans, it's probably not out of the realms of possibility.

Big fan: 'When I saw [Taylor] had re-blogged it I screamed and threw my phone and for the next six hours after that I was an ugly mess,' said Morgan, pictured with Taylor's latest album, 1989

In January, the generous star mailed a box of personalized gifts to a 25-year-old singer who posted a video of herself singing to Tumblr.

And in December, an Arizona schoolteacher received a similar box after posting a video of herself lip-syncing to some of Taylor's songs. In the same month, another woman, this one in Connecticut, was gifted a toy Mercedes for her child.

Clearly is pays to be a fan of Taylor Swift.
