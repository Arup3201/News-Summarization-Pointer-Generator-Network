The mother of a British journalist arrested and charged with piracy in Russia begged for the release of her son today as he was denied bail.

Kieron Bryan, 29, a freelance videographer who was filming a Greenpeace protest against Russian oil drilling in the Arctic, could face 15 years in prison if convicted.

His mother Ann Bryan told the Daily Mail 
she was ‘worried beyond belief’ about her son and described her ‘total 
disbelief’ at his arrest and detention.

She said: ‘We just feel total disbelief and are in 
complete shock. We’re worried beyond belief but we’re trying to keep 
strong and positive for him because we’re no good to him if we fall 
apart.'

Mr Bryan was arrested along with another journalist and 28 activists after the coastguard stormed the ship they were aboard and detained them.

His distraught family say he is a journalist, not an activist, and was only doing his job, so the Russians should let him go.

Celebrities including actor Jude Law, Blur’s Damon Albarn and fashion designer Vivienne Westwood have called for his release along with hundreds of journalists worldwide.

Even Russian President Vladimir Putin’s human rights adviser has also urged prosecutors to drop piracy charges against those arrested.

‘These charges are laughable because there isn’t the slightest justification for accusing the crew of the Arctic Sunrise of piracy,’ Mikhail Fedotov said in an interview in Moscow.

Worry: Kieron and his parents Ann and Andy Bryan

Today, a court in Murmansk ruled that Mr Bryan, of London, should remain in pre-trial detention ahead of a hearing on November 24.

Russia arrested all 30 people on board the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise on September 18 after it approached an oil drilling rig owned by state-controlled Gazprom.

Those on board – including six Britons – have been accused of piracy, which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years. So far, all six bail applications made have been refused.

Today, Mr Bryan told the court that he had ‘verbal agreements with many leading TV companies’ to provide them with footage of the protest upon his return.

Lawyers for Mr Bryan and Philip Ball, of Oxfordshire, argued that Gazprom's Prirazlomnaya oil platform was more an island than a ship, so piracy charges shouldn’t apply.

On the decision to deny her son bail, Mrs Bryan said: ‘We are disappointed obviously, but it’s nothing more than what we were expecting going by the last few weeks.

The school administrator, from Shebbear, Devon, described her emotions when he was first arrested adding: ‘It was so awful. We got a phone call from Kieron saying he was being taken to Murmansk and that it would take a few days to sort out but not to worry.

‘As each day goes by, the worry just gets worse. I beg Russia to find a sensible way out of this and to be reasonable and just.

‘Kieron is not a member of Greenpeace and never has been. He was simply employed by them. He is a journalist and is just doing his job.

‘He is always professional and impartial.'

She added that the charge of piracy was ‘ludicrous’.

Today, John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said of the refusal to grant bail: ‘This decision flies in the face of all reason.

‘We have offered the Russian courts significant sureties that would guarantee the return of all those accused if and when a trial took place.

‘The decision of the court to refuse bail looks increasingly like the Russian authorities are meting out unnecessarily harsh punishment even before any trial.

‘In the case of Kieron Bryan, he is a professional journalist, travelling on the Greenpeace ship, witnessing a peaceful protest against oil drilling in the Arctic Ocean.

‘He has committed no crime and should be released immediately.’

Politicians and celebrities have already demanded the immediate release of the freelance videographer.

The UK government has raised the case of the six detained Britons with the Russian authorities.

The other Britons being held are Frank Hewetson from London, Anthony Perrett from Newport in Wales, Alexandra Harris, originally from Devon and Iain Rogers, from Exeter.
