The women of the Royal family gave a masterclass in how to wear hats today at Westminster Abbey.

Arriving to celebrate 60 years of the Queen's coronation, the collection of hats on display included extravagant wide-brimmed pieces, bespoke 1950s styles, cute cocktail hats and every manner of decoration.

The Queen's hat was a departure from her usual style, made of a pale gold fabric that matched her dress and trimmed with pale blue silk chiffon flowers underneath the tilted brim.

The Duchess of Cambridge chose to wear the same Jane Taylor cocktail hat that she wore for last year's Jubilee celebrations, a bespoke blush-coloured piece featuring net and delicate beading.

She wore the stylish hat with a lace long-sleeved dress as she led one of the tables at a Westminster Hall lunch held in honour of the Queen for her Jubilee.

Sophie, Countess of Wessex also chose a style by the British brand.

Her 1950s style sinamay hat featured pretty lace detail to match her summery Bruce Oldfield dress.

Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, chose a  £910 Jane Taylor cocktail hat for the service

Kate wore the hat at last year's Jubilee celebrations, teaming it with a lace long-sleeved dress

Princess Beatrice, bucking the pale 
trend set by the rest of the royals in a black funnel-necked dress, wore
 a feather-trimmed hat by Sarah Cant.

It's the second time in a week that the 24-year-old princess has worn the brand, also wearing it to Epsom races on Saturday.

Sister
 Eugenie's velvet cocktail hat was by Welsh milliner Robyn Coles, a 
dramatic bow adding a bit of interest to the petite headpiece.

She wore a hat by the same brand to the Garden Party at Buckingham Palace last week.

Kate looked delighted to be sat near her aunt Sophie in the service, maybe they were swapping fashion tips?

Zara Phillips, who looked stylish and
 summery in a graphic print shift dress, chose a hat by one of her 
favourite milliner's Karen Henriksen.

The black sinamay accessory matched her shoes and belt.

Camilla, who has recently been dubbed the Duchess of glamour thanks to her chic new look, was glowing in a pale blue coat by Bruce Oldfield.

She chose a feather-trimmed straw hat in the same shade.

Today's service at Westminster Abbey celebrated the 60th anniversary of the Queen's coronation.

The
 monarch was crowned at the Abbey on June 2, 1953 and within its ancient
 walls she will mark the milestone with the nation and her family.

The weather on the day of the 
coronation 60 years ago was dull and rainy but it did not put off the 
estimated three million people who lined the route of the procession.

Spectators
 and guests were bathed in brilliant summer sunshine as they arrived for
 the formal service or lined the streets near the Abbey.

Camilla chose a very pale blue hat featuring a clutch of pretty feathers

Princess Michael of Kent chose a wide-brimmed sinamy design while Autumn Phillips wore a summery style featuring two chiffon roses

The Pippa Middletons of their day, six aristocratic women - Lady Rosemary Spencer-Churchill, Lady Jane Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Lady Anne Coke, Lady Mary Baillie-Hamilton, Lady Moyra Hamilton and Lady Jane Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby - were chosen to be maids of honour to the Queen on her coronation day. 

Their task, aside from looking young and beautiful, was to carry the Queen’s train, so heavy she couldn’t move without them. An annexe had been built on to the Abbey where the four taking part in the procession but who did not travel in the coach could drink coffee and listen to the radio commentary of the Queen’s journey from Buckingham Palace.

Today all six were at Westmonster Abbey to celebrate sixty years since that momentous day.
