The novelty Christmas jumper used to be seen as a cringeworthy festive present knitted by a great aunt, and 
was regarded by the fashion police as the ultimate crime.

But now the festive pullover has done a U-turn and gone from a fashion mistake to a fashion must-have.

And it seems that while women are loving their festive knits, men can’t get enough of their woolly 
antlers, snowmen and snowflakes either - and it's all thanks to Justin Bieber, Joey Essex and JLS.

Trend setters: Justin Bieber, JLS and Joey Essex have all helped boost sales of Christmas jumpers for men

Thanks to the fashion savvy male pop stars, the festive warmers are selling like hot cakes, with 10,000 flying off the shelves in the last two weeks alone at Asda.

Research by the store reveals that men can't get enough of the novelty knits with 45 per cent of men buying a festive jumper compared to only 28 per cent of women. 

Colin Firth kicked off the trend when he sported a jumper in the 2001 film of Bridget Jones’s Diary - although back then it was still seen as a fashion faux pas.

Fast forward to 2012 and Justin Bieber, JLS, McFly and Joey Essex have all been spotted proudly sporting the comedy garment.

George Brand Director Fiona Lambert said: ‘Christmas jumpers are a fabulous way to embrace the festive season and are now a fashion trend in their own right.

Big sales: Thanks to the likes of Mcfly donning the novelty jumpers, Asda have seen sales soar

'What used to be a dreaded hand-knitted gift from a Great Aunt is now seriously chic. We’re seeing thousands of shoppers, with men in particular, snapping up the knitwear.

'Just like the infamous onesie, they're proving to be a 2012 Christmas staple and we have ensured there are plenty in stock from novelty Christmas puddings to the classic Fair Isle knit.

'Unlike other trends that come and go the Christmas jumper is here to stay. Everyone should own at least one.’

It's a sell out! Asda (L) have sold thousands and Jamie Laing has even created his own for his Candy Kittens line (R)

It isn't just Asda reaping the reward of the latest trend either.

Chris Martin of High Street store New Look said: 'Our Christmas jumper range has exceeded all expectations and we have sold out of all stock with two weeks to go before Christmas.

'During our peak week we sold a Christmas jumper every minute. We already have plans on how to make next years range more exciting and to create the same buzz as this year!'.
