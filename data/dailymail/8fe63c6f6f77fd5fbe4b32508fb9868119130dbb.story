Don't worry Andre Schurrle, you have scored in a World Cup semi-final. That memory should keep the Germany forward sane when he reflects on all the opportunities he wasted against Bolton last night.

The more he tried, the more he looked to the heavens. The final shot count for Schurrle was 12, four times as many as Bolton managed during the entire 90 minutes.

Thankfully for the 23-year-old, Kurt Zouma and Oscar were more accurate as the Blues booked a Capital One Cup last-16 trip to League Two Shrewsbury. It should have been a much smoother ride for the west London club, though.

Bolton (4-5-1): Lonergan 7.5; Herd 6, Mills 6.5, Dervite 6, Moxey 5, Feeney 5 (Spearing 68, 5), Danns 5 (Mason 82), Pratley 5, Kamara 5, Davies 5 (Lee 52); Beckford 5

‘Andre’s performance reflected the mentality of the team,’ said Steve Holland, Chelsea’s assistant coach. 

‘Not much more than two months ago he was playing in the World Cup final, tonight he was playing in the Capital One Cup. He showed a real committed performance — full of drive all night. He looked our most likely source throughout the game. He was an example of what was best about our performance.

‘A combination of some missed chances, a bit of bad luck and some very good goalkeeping meant that we were still at the limit right at the end of the game.’

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho fielded an understrength side, giving goalkeeper Petr Cech his first appearance of the season. 

Mourinho also gave Loic Remy a full debut after his move from Queens Park Rangers, while there were starts for youngsters Nathan Ake and Kurt Zouma.

Bolton manager Dougie Freedman also made five changes from the side that started their Championship defeat by Wolves on Saturday.

Chelsea began as if they meant business, possibly prompted by Mourinho’s wardrobe choice — the Portuguese opting for a suit rather than the tracksuit he favoured during this tournament last season.

Or perhaps it was the fact Freedman kept him waiting for the customary pre-match handshake. Whatever it was, Chelsea came flying out the blocks and could have been four up inside 17 minutes.

Schurrle had enough chances to have scored a hat-trick before the game was a quarter of an hour old. He was denied twice inside the first five minutes; his free-kick tipped wide by Andy Lonergan before a header was cleared off the line by Matt Mills.

Mills again denied Schurrle, this time with a well-timed challenge as the World Cup winner met Cesar Azpilicueta’s cross after 14 minutes.

Then Remy fluffed a chance to break the deadlock with a poor header before Schurrle squandered another chance. 

He was getting closer, though, his 20-yard free-kick being tipped on to the bar by Lonergan.

The goal finally arrived in the 25th minute, but from an unlikely source. Bolton defender Dorian Dervite blocked Gary Cahill’s header from Mohamed Salah’s corner only for the ball to drop to Zouma and the French centre back slammed home his first goal for the club.

Relief swept through the crowd but seven minutes later Bolton snatched a shock equaliser. Liam Feeney’s deep free-kick looked more hopeful than accurate but Mills rose above Jon Obi Mikel to head home from 14 yards. 

The goal did not alter the flow of the game, however, as Chelsea — and Schurrle, looked to regain the lead.

The German missed two more chances before Ake thumped a long-range drive well over the bar just before the break.

Schurrle, inevitably, was involved in their first chance of the second half but Oscar’s header from the German’s free-kick was well saved by the over-worked Lonergan in the 51st minute.

Five minutes later, Chelsea made the vital breakthrough as Oscar thumped a 25-yard drive past Lonergan after good work by Remy.

As if to rub salt into Schurrle’s wounds, he then saw his 80th-minute drive from 15 yards tipped on to a post by Lonergan, who gratefully held on to the loose ball. It was just one of those nights for Schurrle.
