A Romanian man who was the mastermind behind the theft of seven artworks by old masters has been jailed today.

Radu Dogaru, 29, admitted being the driving force behind the three-minute heist at a Dutch museum during which he made off with paintings by Monet, Picasso and Lucien Freud.

His driver, Eugen Darie, also admitted being part of the operation in October 2012. Both men, who were not in court, were sentenced to six years and eight months behind bars.

The duo earlier told the court that they thought they were stealing fakes at that security at the Kunsthal gallery in Rotterdam was very lax.

While the exact fate of the paintings is unknown it is feared that Dogaru's mother, Olga, burned them in her oven in an attempt to destroy evidence against her son.

The woman, who is currently on trial, allegedly admitted the act to police but later changed her story.

'Girl in Front of Open Window' was painted by Paul Gauguin in 1898 and was taken by Dogaru and Darie

Waterloo Bridge, London by Claude Monet was also taken from the Kunsthal gallery in Rotterdam

Another Monet, Charing Cross Bridge, London was also stolen in October last year by the gang

Ashes found in the oven were examined by forensic experts and was found to contain chemicals often used in 19th and 20th century paint, and what appeared to be nails from the frames.

Triton Foundation, which owned the works, has reportedly been paid £14.7million ($23.8million) by their insurer despite some experts valuing the collection at up to £100million.

Three other men are also due to stand trial in connection with the robbery on December 3.

The seven paintings stolen were Monet’s Waterloo Bridge and Charing Cross Bridge (both 1901), Picasso’s Harlequin Head (1971), Matisse’s Reading Girl In White And Yellow (1919), Lucian Freud’s Woman With Eyes Closed (2002), Gauguin’s Girl in Front of Open Window (1898) and Meyer de Haan’s Autoportrait (1890).

The theft was one of the art world's most dramatic in recent years and one of the biggest ever to take place in the Netherlands.

The Kunsthal exhibition, displaying a large part of the Triton Foundation's avant-garde collection for the first time in one gallery, opened just a few days before the heist to celebrate Kunsthal's 20th anniversary.

The Triton Foundation exhibition was showing works by more than 150 famed artists, including Alexander Calder, Paul Cezanne, Marc Chagall, Salvador Dali, Edgar Degas, Marcel Duchamp, Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, August Rodin, and Andy Warhol.

The Kunsthal, meaning 'art gallery' in Dutch, is a display space that has no permanent collection of its own.

The collection was put together by the Cordia family, which made its fortune in shipping and oil and which ranks among the 100 richest families in the Netherlands, according to Dutch media.
