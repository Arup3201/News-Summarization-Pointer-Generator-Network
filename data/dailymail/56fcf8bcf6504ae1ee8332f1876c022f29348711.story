When it came to their granddaughter's 21st birthday one pair of grandparents weren't content with gifting a key in the door.

Dee and Harry Giles made their granddaughter's dreams come true when they paid for her to get the boob job she had always wanted.

Amy Hart, 22, from Worthing West Sussex had always suffered from low body confidence due to her 34A bust.

Amy Hart turned to her grandparents for a loan when her mother couldn't afford her £5000 boob job

Although she was often compared to soap star Helen Flanagan, Amy still suffered from self esteem issues and hated being photographed in a bikini.

So when it came to deciding on a 21st birthday present, breast implants were the obvious choice for Amy.

However, when the air stewardess approached her mother with her request, Susanne Hart said that operation - costing £5000 - was out of the question.

Desperate to get the breasts to match her size 8 figure, Amy turned to her grandparents.

Amy says she had always felt really self-conscious wearing a bikini with her 34A breasts

Amy has now gone up four cup sizes to a 34DD and she says she has never felt more confident

Her doting relatives were hesitant at first but when Amy said that if they couldn't help she would take out a commercial loan Harry and Dee finally relented and agreed to lend her the cash.

Once she was given the go ahead, Amy wasted no time and days later had booked an appointment with a private surgeon and decided on a double D pair to take the place of her natural boobs.

The stewardess was no stranger to surgery having had her teeth corrected when she was just a teenager.

'When I was 17 I had veneers for my teeth and they made me so much more confident and willing to smile I figured that it would be a similar story with my boobs.'

Since her operation Amy has felt confident enough to try her hand at beauty pageants

Despite it being a life long dream to have bigger breasts, Amy admits that she was nervous about the operation. 

'I had a wobble the week before my surgery but when they came to draw on me I figured it was too late now and I was sure it was the right decision.' 

Since having the procedure the 22-year-old feels so confident that she has turned to beauty pageants to flaunt her new figure and has spent the last year strutting the catwalk.

'I'm loving getting in to the pageant circuit - I would never have had the confidence before I had the surgery' says Amy.

'The best bit is that it's not all about looking nice and pretty dresses - it's about inspiring younger girls and raising thousands for charity.'

Amy says that since her operation she has been able to where whatever she wants without feeling self conscious about her small chest.

'I've always been flat-chested and all my friends are really skinny with massive boobs and I would actually hide and refuse to sunbathe next to them.

'Now I never worry about putting on a bikini or a nice dress to go out because my boobs are ample enough to fill them. And it's all thanks to my grandma and granddad.'  

Amy thought about keeping her procedure a secret but has decided her implants are something to be proud of

Although her grandparents originally paid for the procedure Amy is helping to cover the cost by repaying them slowly.

'Borrowing the money from my grandparents was definitely worth it - even though I'm paying it back bit by bit every month.'

Amy attempted to keep her breast implants quiet but has since decided that they are something to be proud of.  

'I thought about keeping my fake boobs a secret, but when a friend told everyone in my hometown I didn't really have a choice.

'And then I thought: "Why should I be ashamed?" I have a career, I didn't take money from the NHS to get them, and I'm much happier.'
