Manchester City’s emerging development into one of Europe’s leading sides was reaffirmed on Thursday after they - and the wider group of City football clubs - announced a ground-breaking commercial partnership with Japanese firm Nissan.

Sportsmail understands that the deal is worth ‘tens of millions’ to Manchester City (Ney York City, Melbourne City and Man City Ladies) and it is the biggest automotive partnership in the Barclays Premier League.

Nissan become the official automotive partner of Manchester City, in a deal that is understood to dwarf other deals of its kind in the Premier League, such as Chelsea’s partnership with Audi and Arsenal’s arrangement with Citroen.

Manchester United’s partnership with Chevrolet is worth considerably more but that is a unique case as it is a kit deal that allows the American company to sponsor United’s shirts.

The five-year deal, which will certainly be worth in excess of £20million to City and potentially more, grants Nissan siginificant brand presence at the Etihad Stadium and on City’s digital platforms. Nissan electric vehicles will also be used when the eagerly awaited City academy campus opens up later in 2014.

The Nissan logo will also adorn the back of the Manchester City women’s football shirt as the Japanese automotive company become the Official Lead Partner of the Women’s team. It also forms part of a wider partnership that will bring benefits to the City Football Group, which includes New York City Football Club and Melbourne City.

City have adopted a more aggressive approach to their commercial strategy in recent times, in an attempts to meet the requirements of Financial Fair Play, after falling foul of the regulations at the end of last season.

Sportsmail understands that the club are no longer unduly concerned by FFP and they believe that they are at a break-even stage with their finances, meaning that they will not be in line for any punishments when UEFA assess the spreadsheets at the end of next season.

City’s clean-cut, evolving image, decorated by an increasing number of trophies, is understood to be acting as a major lure to sponsors and in the corridors of power at the Etihad Stadium, executives are delighted by this latest breakthrough. The deal follows the announcement in May that City had acquired a stake in the Nissan-owned Japanese side Yokohama F. Marinos.

Chairman Khaldoon al Mubarak said: ‘We are delighted to be working with Nissan as CFG’s first group-wide global partner. Nissan is a leader in innovation and sustainability; values which are also at the heart of our own organisation.’
