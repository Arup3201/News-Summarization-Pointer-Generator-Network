Wigan chairman Dave Whelan has been banned for six weeks from football-related activities over comments he made regarding Jewish and Chinese people but the 78-year-old will not carry out his threat to quit the club.

Whelan accepted an aggravated misconduct charge from the FA and has also been fined £50,000, warned as to his future conduct and ordered to undertake a mandatory education programme.

However the club issued a statement saying that according to the full findings of the case - which have yet to be made public by the FA - the commission was satisfied that Whelan 'is not a racist'. Sources close to Whelan said that on that basis, he would not quit football.

The Wigan chairman has seven days in which to appeal or accept the sanction, which would be suspended until after the outcome of any appeal or would begin immediately if he decides to accept the punishment.

The ban would mean he is unable to attend matches, stadiums, club offices or training grounds during the six weeks.

The Wigan chairman made the remarks in a newspaper interview defending his decision to appoint Malky Mackay as the club's new manager. Mackay is the subject of an investigation into alleged racist and anti-Semitic texts sent while he was in charge of Cardiff.

Whelan told The Guardian it was 'nothing' to call a Chinese person a 'c***k' and stated: 'Jewish people do chase money more than everybody else.'

Wigan's statement quoted the Commission's findings as saying Whelan 'did not intend to cause offence'.

The statement from the club said: 'Wigan Athletic can confirm the findings of an independent regulatory commission following statements made by Chairman Dave Whelan in the Guardian newspaper on November 20.

'In summary, the FA Commission concluded that: 'We are satisfied on the evidence before us that Mr Whelan is not a racist. We are equally satisfied on the evidence before us that Mr Whelan did not intend to cause any offence by his comments. It is clear that he himself is very upset by the words he used and he moved very quickly to apologise publicly, plead guilty and begin to make amends'.'

Whelan had previously indicated he would resign if the FA even suggested he was guilty of using racist language saying in November: 'Should they even suggest I'm guilty, I would immediately resign from my position as chairman of Wigan Athletic.'

Simon Johnson, the chief executive of the Jewish Leadership Council, applauded the FA's sanctions and says he is content that Whelan is not racist and made his comments with no racist intent.

'I accept the FA's decision, they have considered it fully, have come up with their verdict and yes, we accept it,' he told Sky Sports News.

'This is an extremely important decision in the fight against racism. It follows the precedent set in the Nicolas Anelka case, it says the intention of the person making the comment was irrelevant and that the most important thing is the meaning of the words.

'This shows the FA is moving towards a position of strict liability for racist comments and it's that development I think is the most welcome.

'I never called for him to resign, that is a matter for him. What we called for was for him to withdraw his comments and apologise.

'He did do that, and I am satisfied, as the FA found, that Mr Whelan is not racist and had no racist intent, but the important thing in the battle against racism in general is that if someone makes a racist comment or action, the most important thing is the plain meaning of what they have done and the impact on the victims, not the intention of the person making it.'

The FA said Whelan had breached FA Rule E3[1] in that comments made to the media were abusive and/or insulting and/or constituted improper conduct and/or brought the game into disrepute, and was an 'aggravated breach' as it included 'a reference to ethnic origin and/or race and/or nationality and/or religion or belief'.

The FA is still investigating a series of texts sent between Mackay and the former head of recruitment at Cardiff, Iain Moody, which it is alleged were discriminatory in nature.

Jonathan Arkush, vice president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews added that he was happy with the outcome.

'Dave Whelan accepted the disciplinary charge after making racist comments and the FA have imposed an appropriate penalty, which I welcome. The Board hopes that the outcome of this sad episode will be a widespread determination by players, managers and fans to kick racism out of football,' he said.
