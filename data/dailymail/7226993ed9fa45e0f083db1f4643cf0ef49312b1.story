A £600million 'health tourism gap' sees the UK paying out  £20 for the healthcare costs of Britons who fall ill on the  continent for every £1 it gets back for the NHS treatment of European visitors

NHS hospitals are getting even worse at clawing back money for foreigners’ healthcare, despite ministers’ pledges to stamp out health tourism.

A £600million ‘health tourism gap’ sees the UK paying out  £20 for the healthcare costs of Britons who fall ill on the  continent for every £1 it gets back for the NHS treatment of European visitors.

The disparity is even worse than it was two years ago, when Britain paid out £16 for every £1 it got back.

It means that, despite promises from David Cameron and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to get to grips with the issue, the gulf is widening year on year.

The figures, released following a Freedom of Information request, show that in 2012/13, British taxpayers handed £649.3million to European governments to pay for the care of UK citizens who fall ill abroad.

But the NHS managed to collect only £32million from the same European countries to pay for the care of their citizens who needed treatment here.

Ministers claim ‘health tourism’ costs British taxpayers billions a year, as many NHS trusts do not even keep records of debts.

Last year cancer specialist Professor J Meirion Thomas warned of a ‘massive and escalating problem’ of foreigners travelling to Britain for cancer, HIV, kidney and infertility treatment then leaving without paying.

He said the NHS was also becoming the ‘world’s maternity wing’.

Some of the gap is due to more British pensioners retiring to the continent than those from the EU here.

There may also be more tourists from Britain going to Europe than the other way.

But there are more than a  million migrant workers from the EU here, against far fewer Britons employed in other  European countries.

In 2012/13, the UK paid Ireland £211million for treating Britons who fell ill there. Only £17.5million came back the other way.

Dia Chakravarty of the TaxPayers' Alliance said: 'Anyone in need of emergency NHS care should be given the necessary treatment, but taxpayers should not be underwriting an international health service'

Some £230million was paid to Spain but only £5.5million came back. France received £128million but returned just £1million. Italy got £8.9million and sent back £830,000, while Greece collected £5.9million and returned £480,000.

The UK received less than £1million from Poland and token payments of £4,100 from Lithuania, £44,936 from Slovakia and £4,920 from Romania.

Under UK immigration laws, the bill for EU citizens’ hospital care should be sent to their own country to settle up, unless they become UK residents.

They cannot apply for residency unless they have lived in this country for five years without a break.

Dia Chakravarty of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Anyone in need of emergency NHS care should be given the necessary treatment, but taxpayers should not be underwriting an international health service.

The NHS needs to start charging market rates for foreign patients rather than charging them amounts which barely cover costs, leaving the taxpayer to pick up the bill.’

Tim Aker, UKIP’s head of policy, said: ‘We must make sure visitors and migrants to the UK have proper, credible health insurance as a condition of entry.’

Last year ministers announced plans to charge foreigners for emergency treatment on the NHS for the first time.

Migrants who go to A&E will be billed between £20 and £100 for a consultation, on top of the cost of their treatment.

The scheme will be implemented later this year.
