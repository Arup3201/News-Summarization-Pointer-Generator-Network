England captain Eoin Morgan hailed the controlled bowling at the death as his side claimed a dramatic three-run win over India at Edgbaston.

Chris Woakes, Harry Gurney and Steven Finn kept it tight to restrict India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, as the visitors finished three runs short of England's 180 for seven.

'Throughout the whole game guys have held their nerve very well,' Morgan told Sky Sports 2.

Final act: Dhoni hits the last ball of the innings, knowing that anything but a boundary isn't enough

'We got ourselves a very good score but we felt with the calibre of batsmen India had if they did get going they would be hard to stop.

'Right at the end Woakes, Finn and Gurney held it together really well.

'They were exceptional. There's very little margin for error when MSD (Dhoni) is at the crease. There were some nerve-racking times but they were great.'

Morgan revealed England's bowlers learnt from India's mistakes on the Edgbaston pitch.

Out of the ground: Morgan found India's low full tosses easy to hit and got his team to bowl a little shorter

'We found when we batted the fuller ball whether it was a yorker or a full toss was easy to hit,' he said.

'We went back to what we thought they should have bowled.

'It did play pretty well. We all expected it to turn square but it didn't. It actually played quite nicely and India bowled reasonably well but to get up to 180 was really good.'
