The 61-year-old has accused the FCO of 'destroying his career'

A former diplomat has won £320,000 damages after the Foreign Office suspended him when he was wrongly accused of touching the bottom of a senior politician's wife.

John Yapp was 'our man in Belize' until he was suspended in 2008 after his superiors confronted him with the allegation made by an opposition politician from the commonwealth state.

Last month, the High Court ruled that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) was wrong to suspend him from his post as High Commissioner with immediate effect - a decision that ultimately cost him his ambassadorial role and destroyed his working life.

The 61-year-old today accused the FCO of 'destroying his career' after the government agreed to pay him £320,000 - along with the six-figure legal costs of the case.

Mr Yapp accused the FCO of trying to 'outspend' him with taxpayers' cash during the legal battle as he celebrated Mr Justice Cranston's order that he should receive £150,000 up front towards his legal bills.

The court heard Mr Yapp was summoned before an FCO mandarin while on leave in June 2008 and hit with accusations that he had a 'bullying' management style and 'displayed inappropriate behaviour towards women at social functions'.

It emerged that the claims of inappropriate behaviour arose from a Belize politician who claimed that Mr Yapp touched his wife's rear at a social gathering.

The accusation - branded 'unfounded and scurrilous' by Mr Yapp's QC, Jane McNeill - was ultimately rejected after an FCO disciplinary probe.

But, by then, it was too late to reinstate Mr Yapp in the Central American state and in subsequent years he found himself increasingly sidelined in professional terms.

His lawyers argued the conduct of the FCO showed a complete lack of consideration for the welfare of a loyal employee.

The sexual misconduct allegations were eventually found to be baseless; however, the nature of his withdrawal, led to media intrusion and caused immense distress to Mr Yapp and his family.

As a result Mr Yapp never returned to work and in due course had to retire after a long period of sick leave.

The Prime Minister of Belize, the Hon. Dean Barrow was a witness in the case.

He described Mr Yapp as 'one of the best High Commissioners we have had in Belize. I found him to be a consummate diplomat: intelligent, well-informed and an entertaining host'.

He added that he and his wife, Kim Simplis Barrow, count Mr Yapp as a personal friend who they were pleased to have at their wedding in 2009.

Other senior members of the local and expatriate communities in Belize praised Mr Yapp equally highly and he has been particularly warmly welcomed back to Belize in recent years by his many friends there, including amongst the remaining local staff of the British High Commission.

Speaking after the hearing, Mr Yapp said: 'It has been a long battle to clear my name and naturally I'm pleased, as are my whole family, that the judgment has gone in my favour and indeed today's orders have gone as we asked.

'I would just say that it seems very unfair that one of the offices of state is using and continuing to use taxpayers' money to outspend an individual.

'It is more than ironic that the Government is abolishing legal aid for civil actions and yet it is using taxpayers' money to try and destroy me and in the full knowledge that my health can not begin to recover until it is over.

'To have my career at its pinnacle and my future prospects destroyed so wrongly and, it seems, on a whim, made me unwell and I have had to go through this for five years now.'

Mr Yapp, of Tunbridge Wells, Kent, said the FCO's failure to back him triggered a major mental breakdown, leaving him depressed and unable to work.

He argued that superiors failed to 'hear his side of the story' before imposing the suspension, despite his 40 years' service as a diplomat, including previous tenure at the High Commissioner in the Seychelles.

Last month, Mr Justice Cranston ruled that the FCO 'acted in breach of contract and in breach of its duty of care in withdrawing Mr Yapp from his post without affording him fair treatment' and that the ex-diplomat was entitled to compensation for his resulting losses.

Today, the judge approved an agreed order whereby Mr Yapp will receive £320,000 damages.

The FCO will also pay £150,000 on account of Mr Yapp's legal costs bills, which have yet to be finally assessed and could be much greater than that.

Alan Payne, for the FCO, said it planned to challenge the judge's ruling in the Court of Appeal.

John Yapp's solicitor, John Kings, said outside court during the case: 'My client is naturally pleased that justice has prevailed after what have been five long and hard - and very costly - years.

'He wishes to thank his wife Anne in particular, for her unswerving love and support throughout; his legal team for seeing at the outset the apparent injustice of his treatment in terms of the law, and for working so hard to address this; each and every one of his witnesses whose belief in justice was very evident; and his many friends and well wishers in Belize, in the UK, and indeed literally across the world.

'I hope that the FCO will be investigating the matter with those responsible for the decisions so wrongly made and taking action in order to ensure that such blatantly unfair and damaging treatment is not repeated.'
