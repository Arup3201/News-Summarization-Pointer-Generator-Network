For decades Charles Dickens' fans had to be satisfied with a fleeting glimpse through a window at the home where the author penned some of his best-loved works.

But now Gad's Hill Place in Higham, Kent  -  home of Dickens' family from 1858 until his death in one of the rooms in 1870 - is about to open its doors to the public for the first time.

His writing desk will be returned to the very study where Dickens wrote Great Expectations, Our Mutual Friend, A Tale of Two Cities and 
the unfinished novel Edwin Drood.

Opening: Visitors will be able to wander the rooms of historic Gad's Hill Place, in Higham, Kent, were Dickens penned some of his best-loved works from 1857 until his death in 1870

During the summer, to celebrate 
the bicentenary of his birth, the Charles Dickens Museum will open the 
ground floor of the house.

The museum intends to return many of the writer’s personal possessions temporarily to their former home; the first time that they have been there since the house and its contents were sold in 1870.  

Charles Dickens Museum director Dr Florian Schweizer said: 'The opening of Gad’s Hill Place is one of the highlight events of the Dickens bicentenary year and will make our Dickens 2012 campaign even more memorable.

'Together with the 
authorities in Kent we have been working for many years on improving 
access to the rich and diverse Dickens heritage in Kent; his former home
in Higham is a heritage treasure waiting to be discovered, and we hope 
that visitors will enjoy this special treat for the anniversary year.

'The
Charles Dickens Museum is delighted to have the opportunity to show 
some of its collections at Gad’s Hill Place and bring alive a place so 
full of literary associations.'

The
historic fabric of the building, which he bought for £1,700 in 1856, is
very much intact and the author’s study is still lined with the faux 
books, which having commissioned for another home, he installed in his 
new one. 

Reunited: The actual desk where Dickens wrote some of his most famous works will return to his study in Gad's Hill Place in time for the opening

Glimpse: Visitors will now be able to stand where Charles Dickens spent hours writing at his desk in Gad's Hill Place, penning many of his classic novels, including Great Expectations

With objects from the collection at Doughty Street, the museum will be bringing these interiors back to life and the exhibition will give a flavour of the life that Dickens led there.

The opening is due to coincide with this year's  £3.2million refurbishment of the Charles Dickens Museum, which is spread over  two houses in which the author lived - 48 and 49 Doughty Street, London.

The Heritage Lottery Fund, which has provided £2.4million towards the project.

The museum will remain open until Easter, after which there will be a continuous series of exhibitions and events in London and beyond, including Gad’s Hill Place.

Gad’s Hill Place will be open from July 25 to August 19 during the afternoons from Wednesday to Sunday for pre-booked guided tours of the key reception rooms and the study.

Stepping back: Visitors will be able to see the Library at Gad's Hill Place, which still has many original features including dummy books. Dickens is pictured, right, enjoying the gardens with daughters Katey and Mary

Restored: Many of Dickens' belongings will be returned to his last home when it opens to the public this summer

Sandra Matthews Marsh, CEO Visit Kent 
said: 'We are delighted that Charles Dickens Museum is coming to Kent 
for the summer.

'The display of his precious desk and the opportunity to 
visit his final home at Gad's Hill Place during the peak of summer are 
really significant additions to our countywide Dickens celebrations 
during his bicentenary.

'We
have a year of special Dickens' events including, of course, our world 
famous Dickens Festivals in Rochester and Broadstairs and will be 
launching a new smartphone and android trails to celebrate Dickens' life
and work in Kent.

'This exhibition will provide visitors with a unique 
opportunity to discover more about the great writers life and his 
connections to our county.'

There is also an exciting programme of special evening events planned together with family and children’s activities to take place in the house and the garden surrounding it.

Admission to Gad’s Hill Place will be by pre-booked ticket. Enquiries to events@dickensmuseum.com

Inspiration: The hill-top holiday home of Charles Dickens, which sits on the sea front in Broadstairs, Kent, was the inspiration for Bleak House

Dickens was famed for weaving into his works the characters and events from his every day life.

The names of Bill Sikes and Scrooge may have derived from real people linked to the famous writer.

The thug in Oliver Twist, the famous Christmas Carol miser and the ghost of his deceased partner have all been associated with people who worked or lived near Dickens's first London home.

According to the research, a trader named William Sykes lived in the same east Marylebone street as Dickens when the writer was a teenager.

Many of his homes, the bricks and mortar, also found themselves as the setting of novels.

1812 February 7: Charles Dickens is born at 1, Mile End Terrace, Landport, 
Portsea, which has since become 393, Old Commercial Road, Portsmouth. 
The house is now the Dickens Birthplace Museum. 

1817 After several intermediate moves, the Dickens family settles at 2, Ordnance Terrace, Chatham.

1822,
The Dickens family moves to London when John Dickens is sent to the 
Marshalsea debtors' prison. Dickens, aged 12, works in Warren’s Blacking 
Warehouse.

1824, John Dickens was released from prison enabling Charles to return to school at the Wellington House Academy.

1837 Dickens moves to 48 Doughty Street in London, now the Charles Dickens Museum and headquarters of the Dickens Fellowship. 

1839 The Dickens family move to 1, Devonshire Terrace, Regent’s Park.

1844-5 The Dickens family take up residence in Italy.

1851 Dickens family moves to Tavistock House, Bloomsbury.

1856 Dickens purchases Gad’s Hill Place, near Rochester.

1870 9 June, Charles Dickens dies at Gad’s Hill Place and is buried in Westminster Abbey.

The Kent landscape and people of 19th century Kent provided rich pickings for Dickens.

In particular, the clutch of towns 
around the River Medway including Chatham and Rochester are referenced 
frequently in Dickens' works. His cliff-top holiday home in Broadstairs provided inspiration for the novel Bleak House.

Anyone standing on the brow of nearby Fort Pitt Hill, can see scenes from eight novels.

John Knott of the Rochester and 
Chatham Dickens Fellowship said: 'Just where we're standing is where the
duel in The Pickwick Papers took place, and if you look out to the 
docks you can see the hulks (prison ships) from Great Expectations.'

The Medway skyline is every inch a 
21st century one but with a modicum of imagination you can imagine 
Magwitch, from Great Expectations, making his way through the marshes.

In the centre of the high street is
Six Poor Travellers House, founded by a Rochester MP in 1563 to provide
'a night's lodging' for transients.

It became the inspiration for Dickens' Seven Poor Travellers and remains perfectly maintained.
