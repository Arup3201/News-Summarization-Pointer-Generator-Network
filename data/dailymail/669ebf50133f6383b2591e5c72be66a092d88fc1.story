Having kept his job on the basis that he provides more entertainment, Sam Allardyce can be quite pleased with this start to the season.

There was no shortage of incident at Upton Park. Unfortunately for Allardyce and West Ham, they were on the wrong end of the fun supplied by two red cards, a penalty miss and a winner in the second minute of added time.

Tottenham new-boy Eric Dier settled the derby, sprinting forward from right-back to collect a pass from Harry Kane, skip around goalkeeper Adrian and roll the ball into the net. Cue delirium from Spurs fans and familiar grumbles from the East End natives.

For Dier, it is a dream-like debut after his transfer from Sporting Lisbon, having started the game at centre-half and finished as a rampaging full-back.

‘I would’ve been happy with a clean sheet,’ said Dier. ‘I wasn’t expecting to get up the other end and score. I’m not sure I got there, I just made a run inside and it [the ball] found me. I’d like to score more goals, so I’m happy.’

For Mauricio Pochettino, this flattering win was a perfect start to life as Daniel Levy’s ninth Spurs boss in 11 years. His team were a man down and under pressure for 33 minutes after Kyle Naughton had been dismissed but before James Collins was also sent off.

‘The important thing is to never give up,’ said Pochettino. ‘There are times in football that are difficult to manage but the team believed. We kept our offensive players on the pitch. We didn’t change. This was the signal from the dugout.’

West Ham had been the better team and ought to have been ahead when, after half an hour, Kevin Nolan spun over a dropping ball, connected with a half-volley on the turn and the ball crashed into the hands of Naughton.

Referee Chris Foy hesitated. Here was a dilemma. The distance between ball and hand was short and the ball had travelled at incredible speed. Naughton had no chance to adjust but the shot was hurtling towards goal.

Assistant referee Michael McDonough was flagging but wanted to indicate a corner, rather than a penalty. Foy, however, once his mind was made up, pointed to the spot and sent off Naughton. ‘The card was unfair,’ said Pochettino. ‘But the most important thing was the team kept calm and carried on.’

West Ham total                   108.5     67.4

Mark Noble               90         12.4       7.7

Kevin Nolan              90         11.5       7.2

Danny Rose             90           10.8        6.7

Pochettino admitted that he was not so calm on the touchline, however, saying: ‘Yes but it’s difficult on the line because it’s impossible to run and it’s impossible to jump, but the team deserved the three points. It was always in our mind, even at 10 v 11, that it was possible to win. That is our philosophy.’

The excitement at Upton Park was quickly punctured when Noble sent Hugo Lloris the wrong way from the spot and rolled his penalty wide.

Allardyce’s team continued to create and squander chances — no player was more wasteful than Ricardo Vaz Te — and Lloris was inspired in the Spurs goal, making two brilliant second-half saves to deny Stewart Downing, the second shortly before Dier’s winner.

The numbers were levelled when Collins was sent off for a second yellow card for two innocuous fouls. His first was for a nudge on Erik Lamela on half-way, his second for a block on Emmanuel Adebayor, when the Spurs striker was looking to be fouled, without support, 25 yards from goal. ‘There were three big factors,’ said Allardyce. ‘One is not being clinical enough after creating chances. Then poor Mark Noble misses a penalty for the first time in my time at the club. Then allowing ourselves to go to 10 v 10.

‘I can’t fault the performance but we were very naive. We had enough to win and paid the ultimate price. This league will punish you.’

As for keeping the owners entertained, he added: ‘We had 20 attempts on goal and the opposition hardly had any. We haven’t deserved to lose. We played very well and we have a lot of players to come back. On that performance our season will be a good one.

‘If they were going to sack me after one game they might as well have done it at the end of last season. Why wait until now?’
