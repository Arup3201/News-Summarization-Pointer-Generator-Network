A pizza delivery driver who lives in a £220,000 four-bedroom house has been fined after he was judged to have the scruffiest back garden in his street.

Neighbours became infuriated with Andrei Jonski, 48, and his wife Angi, who moved into their dream home in Driffield, East Yorkshire, eight years ago.

Rubble, car parts, plastic sheeting, wood and old tyres soon built up in the back garden of the family home and a red Fiat Cinquecento appeared abandoned on the front lawn, a court heard.

Neighbours complained about their view of his garden, which is full of rubble, tyres and plastic sheeting

After realising nothing had moved for months, especially when the couple took their two children on holiday to Poland in August 2013, a string of neighbours complained to East Riding of Yorkshire Council.

Planning officers at the authority agreed it was not the 'amenity value' expected on a modern estate, with the amenity comprising of bedroom views from five houses which overlook the family’s back garden.

The council planning department gave Mr Jonski six weeks to tidy up in June 2013 – or provide a valid reason not to.

After ignoring their order six months later he was summoned to court for failing to comply with section 215 of the Town and Country Planning Act, requiring him to maintain land.

He was handed a criminal conviction by Bridlington Magistrates’ Court in March and appeared at Hull Crown Court last Thursday to appeal the decision.

In his hearing Mr Jonski said he, rather than his wife, was solely responsible for the garden: ‘For me my garden is perfect. My wife does not like it, but I paid for this house and I paid for this garden.

‘It is a building site at the moment, but in a year’s time it will be the best garden in Driffield with a sauna and a Jacuzzi.’

He said his trouble began in 2010 when he fell out with his neighbours over building in his garden and the enforcement notice was their revenge.

He said first they complained about the size of his shed then they moved on to the state of his garden.

He said they had put up decking to use their garden more and the complaints followed.

Mr
 Jonski said he had complained about their noise and flood water caused 
by the decking into his garden, but was told by the council they were 
civil matters.

‘My neighbours hate me,’ said Mr Jonski.

‘My neighbours complain. I am not 
angry with the council officers, they are only doing their job. I can 
only be angry for the hateful neighbours.’

He
 said he accepted the frequent visits by the council officers to check 
on him, and admitted he had put up a sign saying ‘No photography’ 
pointing to his neighbours over the back fence.

He added: ‘I will soon be putting it back’.

He
 protested about the council officer’s visit to his wife, who is a 
dentist, at work in Bridlington Hospital with the letter saying he, 
rather than her, was responsible.

He
 said: ‘It is my private house. No one else can see it. Only Google can 
see it from their satellite. I am not throwing away good stuff. I am 
building a 2m deep pit for compressors in my shed.’

He
 told the judge: ‘I am not a silly or stupid person. I did not receive 
the letter so I did not comply with it. If I had received it, I would 
not agree, but I would ask them what to do.’

Council
 planning officer Jonathan Middleton, who drafted the enforcement notice
 with the council’s legal department, said he had attended Mr Jonski's 
property and told him of neighbours’ complaints, but on one occasion Mr 
Jonski had appeared confrontational.

He said they had acted on neighbours’ 
complaints in October 2012 and had given him repeated warning the 
matters were being taken seriously.

He
 said the council had given Mr Jonski a list of things it wanted doing, 
including the moving of rubble, car parts and metal into existing 
buildings and the removal of the Fiat from the front lawn and six week 
to do it.

Mr Middleton told the hearing: 'In our view the state of the property was harming the amenity of the area'.

‘The neighbours had to look at children’s bikes, old broken tools, building materials, wheels, tyres, car parts and a vehicle trailer up against a wall.

‘A small red Fiat is parked on the lawn which was seen as they went past every day. It is an open plan estate, the car was next to the road and highly visible’.

A red Fiat Cinquecento appeared abandoned on the front lawn of the four-bed house, Hull Crown Court heard

‘Easingwood Way is a small cul-de-sac with five houses, all built tightly overlooking each other and all looked into each others gardens.

‘Each item on its own was not illegal, but the total effect could affect residential amenity.

‘We don’t serve notices on people who have temporarily parked a car on a lawn. Serving a notice is a last resort.’

Asked by the judge if Mr Jonski could have avoided complaint by pulling a huge tarpaulin over his lawn, Mr Middleton said if the council were to receive a complaint the tarpaulin was unsightly, and he viewed it was harming the local amenity, they would serve a notice.

Recorder Abdul Iqbal, QC, said Mr Jonski had shown in court he could be confrontational and he was in no doubt council officers had served the correct notice on him.

He said he had evidence of car parts, rubble, bikes tools and drums in the garden and of the neighbours’ concerns.

‘There is ample evidence the notices were served correctly on Mr Jonski,’ said Recorder Iqbal.

‘We accept the evidence Mr Middleton explained the situation to him through a number of visits.’

He said the appeal had failed and the magistrates’ fine of £2,299 still needed to be paid.

He ordered a further £720 in costs for the Crown appeal hearing – totalling £3,019.

Recorder Iqbal told Mr Jonski his claims to afford only £60 a week, from his part-time job as a delivery driver, was ridiculous: ‘You can’t live in a large house like this and afford a sauna and a Jacuzzi with an income of £60 a week. You will pay £150 a month.

‘If you don’t, there are consequences for you.’

Mr Jonski protested he wanted to appeal and be given a transcript of proceedings and he was ordered to be quiet or face leaving by the cells for being in contempt.
