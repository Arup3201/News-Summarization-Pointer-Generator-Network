Helmet manufactures Masuri say they will 'seek as much TV and video footage as possible' after Phil Hughes was left fighting for his life after being struck in the head while wearing one of their products. 

Australian batsman Hughes is in an induced coma in intensive care after being knocked unconscious by a bouncer during a Sheffield Shield match on Tuesday.

Masuri say that their thoughts are with Hughes and their family but claim he was wearing one of their old models, and new equipment is available which offers extra protection. They claim he was 'struck in a vulnerable area of the head and neck that helmets cannot fully protect'.

The left-hander, who has played 26 Tests for Australia and been involved in three Ashes series, has been visited in hospital in Sydney by many of his team-mates, past and present.

The  opener, according to Cricket Australia, was 'struck on the back, lower left side of the head when he turned away as he followed through with an attempted pull-shot to a regulation short-pitched delivery from young NSW quick Sean Abbott'.

Pictures from the Sydney Cricket Ground also show the ball hitting Hughes in that place, and as the 25-year-old fights for his life, questions are now being asked about player safety.

Masuri said in a statement that Hughes was wearing its 'Original Test model' when the incident occurred, but that has now been superseded by the 'Vision Series' which has a new helmet and grille profile.

There can be no confirmation as to whether the incident could have been avoided regardless of what Hughes was wearing, but Masuri says it is constantly looking to make improvements.

The statement said: 'Following the injury to Phil Hughes, Masuri is actively seeking as much TV and video footage of the incident as possible, to be able to see more conclusively exactly where the player was hit.

'Masuri would immediately like to join with the world of cricket in wishing Phil Hughes a full and speedy recovery.

'From the footage and pictures currently available to Masuri, it appears that Phil Hughes was struck by the ball to the rear of the grille and below the back of the shell, missing his Masuri Original Test model helmet.

The front cover of Wednesday's Daily Telegraph in Australia reflected the goodwill for Hughes

'This is a vulnerable area of the head and neck that helmets cannot fully protect, while enabling batsmen to have full and proper movement.

'The newly-developed Masuri Vision Series helmet, which supersedes the 2013 helmet worn by Phil Hughes, does afford batsmen extra protection in this region – and still allows comfortable movement.'  

Masuri Managing Director Sam Miller said: 'The thoughts of everyone at Masuri are with Phil Hughes and his family.

'Helmet manufacturers are constantly developing their products to make them safer.

'We work continuously with the governing authorities worldwide to reduce the risk of injury to players.' 

The 25-year-old, playing for South Australia against New South Wales at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG), was struck on the side of his helmet by a Sean Abbott delivery and collapsed face-first to the ground shortly afterwards.

It is now a tense wait for the loved ones and cricketing colleagues who rushed to his bedside - including Australia captain Michael Clarke - to hear if Hughes' surgery was successful. His family has released a statement which said 'the outcome of that surgery is unlikely to be known for the next 24 to 48 hours.'
