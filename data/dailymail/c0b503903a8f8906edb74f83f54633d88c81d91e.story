BBC sports presenter Gabby Logan called Andy Murray 'the moodiest most miserable b******' she has ever met during a talk with students

Gabby Logan has branded Andy Murray the ‘most miserable b******’ she has ever met.

The TV presenter was joking with an audience about her experience interviewing him at last summer’s Olympics.  

He was in such a foul mood after losing the mixed doubles final that she just wanted to tell him to ‘cheer up’.

The BBC sports presenter said: ‘I was a big fan. Then at the Olympics he had just won a silver with Laura Robson and he was the moodiest, most miserable b****** I’ve ever met in my life, because he only won a silver.’ She added: ‘If I wasn’t on live telly I’d have gone “cheer up”.’

Defeat in the doubles final came the same day he had been beaten Roger Federer in the men’s singles final to win Olympic gold.

The following year Murray became the first British man in 77 years to win Wimbledon, defeating Novak Djokovic in  the final.

The former gymnast, who is married to ex-rugby player Kenny Logan, may come across as motherly and mild, when coaxing contestants onto the diving board in ITV’s Splash! – but it seems she has a sharp tongue on her, too.

During the talk at Leeds Trinity University, Mrs Logan, 40, also poked fun at marathon runner Paula Radcliffe about the time she stopped to relieve herself during a race, saying: ‘One guy tweeted and said “my wife thinks Paula’s dress is nicer than yours”. So I showed Paula and she p***** herself. Again.’

And she joked about footballer Ryan Giggs’s affair with his  sister-in-law and mocked former England star Gary Lineker for becoming a ‘crisp salesman’.

Speaking about her fellow BBC presenter, she said: ‘A lot of people don’t see Gary as a footballer any more, they see him as a crisp salesman… sorry, they see him as a broadcaster.’

Her spokesman said: ‘These quotes clearly formed part of a humorous speech.’

The Splash! TV presenter admitted she and her husband worry that Lois, who is eight, could develop body image issues as she grows up. 

Mrs Logan represented Wales in rhythmic gymnastics but was forced to retire from the sport aged 17 due to sciatica.

She kept a diary during her teenage years and admitted that she wrote about feeling uncomfortable with her changing body once she hit puberty. 

Mrs Logan who co-presented Olympics 2012 for the BBC alongside Clare Balding, made her comments in a wide-ranging interview in which she spoke about the importance of healthy eating in her family and being able to recognise hunger.

Mrs Logan said: ’I would never want my daughter to think she had to eat less of something. We talk about over eating, about how that’s not good, to eat more than you need to.

All in good jest: Gabby Logan also poked fun at Gery Lineker and Paula Radcliffe during the talk

‘But at the same time you can give those messages without it being about body image, it’s about health again. It all comes back to health as opposed to being svelte or fitting into your jeans.’

Mrs Logan, who is married to Kenny, 41, said: ‘I was always aware, when you do gymnastics you’re always in a leotard – you can’t be any more, the next thing is being naked. And so you’re very aware of your body so when I hit puberty I didn’t want to change.'

Mrs Logan has now joined a Tesco healthy eating campaign called Eat Happy.
