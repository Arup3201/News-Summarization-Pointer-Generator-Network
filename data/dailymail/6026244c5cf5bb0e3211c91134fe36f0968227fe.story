Most parents try to stop their children from climbing all over the walls.

But not this father, who can be seen encouraging his young daughter to climb a door frame in a video uploaded to YouTube.

The young girl, dressed in a Spiderman mask and still wearing nappies, manages to scale the frame all the way to the top moulding – until she loses her grip and slides down as if it were a fireman’s pole.

Using her hands to grip onto the frame and her feet to propel up the wall, the young girl manages to climb to the top of the door frame.

As she scales the wall, music from a Spiderman cartoon series can be heard playing in the background.

But as the young girl starts struggling to keep hold of the wooden frame, the father can be heard laughing as he continues to film.

Once the young girl reaches the door frame’s upper moulding, she tries to reach higher – but her hands fail her and she slides down the frame.

Her feet manage to buffer her fall, but she loses her balance and falls on to her rear end.

All the while, her father is heard laughing as he continues to film.

Uninjured and unconcerned, the girl instead shows off her superhero moves for the camera – crouching slightly, putting her hands on her knees and moving her head from side-to-side.

She then rolls her pants up to show her father she didn’t hurt herself.

Once he’s happy that she wasn’t hurt, the father continues to film his young daughter – who is clearly enjoying the attention she is receiving.

‘Take your mask off and show me your muscles,’ the father instructs.

To that, his young daughter lifts the mask and flexes her arm for the camera.

Wanting to keep her secret identity hidden, the young girl then puts the mask back on, rolls down her pants and gets set for her next superhero venture.
