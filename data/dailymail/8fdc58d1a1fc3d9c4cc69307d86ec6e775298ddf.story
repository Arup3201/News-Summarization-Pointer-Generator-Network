Arrested again: Radio DJ Neil Fox was arrested after voluntarily attending a central London police station today in connection with a sexual assault

Radio DJ Neil Fox was today arrested for the third time on suspicion of sexual offences. 

The 53-year-old, who has been suspended from his job at Magic FM while police inquiries continue, is accused of a woman in the 1990s.

In September Fox, who lives in Fulham, south west London with his wife and children, was arrested in relation to four alleged incidents against two women. 

Two months later he revisited a central London police station where he was accused of three more offences. 

Today Scotland Yard confirmed he had been arrested again in relation to an additional alleged incident. 

The eight alleged incidents are said to have taken place in the 1990s, in 2007 and in the past year. 

Fox, a former Pop Idol judge, vehemently denied the allegations after his first arrest.   

Today a Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Officers from Westminster arrested a 53-year-old man last September following four allegations of sexual assault against two women.

'Three of the allegations are non-recent; one is from earlier this year.

'The man was arrested at a business address in central London and taken to a central London police station. 

'Officers subsequently searched addresses in Fulham and the Littlehampton area of West Sussex.

'On Monday December 8th he returned on bail to a central London police station and was arrested for a further three sexual assaults involving different women. 

'Two allegations are said have happened in the 1990s, the third was said to have happened in 2007.

'Today, he voluntarily attended a central London police station and was further arrested for an allegation of sexual assault against an additional female victim. This offence is said to have happened in the early 1990s.

'The man has now been bailed to return pending further inquiries to a date in late March.'

Mr Fox was first held by detectives on September 30 at the Magic FM offices in London just moments after coming off-air

Following his arrest last September the DJ, who rose to fame in the late 1980s at London's Capital Radio, vowed to clear his name. 

Fox, who uses the nicknames Dr Fox and Foxy, began his career in local radio before moving to Radio Luxembourg and then London's Capital Radio in the late 1980s.

He presented various slots there and in 1993, landed the job of presenting the Sunday afternoon Network Chart Show, later known as the Pepsi chart.

His big TV break, which brought him to a wider audience, was as a judge on ITV talent show Pop Idol between 2001 and 2003 alongside Simon Cowell, Pete Waterman, and Nicki Chapman.

Fox later appeared in the BBC Three sketch show The Wrong Door.

He left Capital in 2005 and joined Magic 105.4, where he presented the breakfast show until being suspended following his arrest last September.

Speaking outside the south west London home where he lives with his 41-year-old wife and three children the day after being arrested, he told gathered reporters: ‘Obviously I had a very stressful day yesterday - it was a complete surprise.

‘I haven’t really got much very to say in terms of a statement at the moment. I need to go and speak to my lawyer and see where it all stands and just see where we are.’

‘I’ve got three young children trying to get on with their school life and you have to respect their privacy in all of this. 

'It’s nothing to do with them, obviously. It’s to do with me and the serious allegations made against me, and obviously what I want to do is work hard to clear my name. 

'As and when I've got more to say I will.’ 

Officers spent some seven hours questioning the DJ before bailing him. He was suspended from his regular slot at Magic FM as a result, with the station eager to allow him 'to devote his full attention to dealing with these matters. 

'All other aspects of his contract will remain unchanged while matters are resolved. 

'We can make no further comment at this stage.’ 

Fox's arrest is not part of Operation Yewtree - the high profile Scotland Yard investigation into alleged sexual offences that was sparked by the Jimmy Savile scandal. 

Fox (far right) is perhaps best known as one of the judges on Pop Idol alongside Simon Cowell, Pete Waterman and Nicki Chapman. He has also presented a Channel 5 show based on the Top 40 Chart
