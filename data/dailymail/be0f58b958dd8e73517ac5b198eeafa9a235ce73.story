It's often called the greatest party on Earth- an explosion of colour, music and dancing.

But in the run-up to the world-famous Rio de Janiero's Carnival, an animal parade at Copacabana beach in Brazil is threatening to rival its human counterpart for its elaborate costumes.

More than 100 decked-out dogs got in on the Carnival spirit at the city's annual Blocao party.

Pet owners take to the streets with their four-legged friends dressed in ornate costumes such as this bumble dog outfit featuring a shiny yellow dog jacket with black sequins, bows and bumble bee headband

A Bichon Frisé Wonder Woman strutted its stuff alongside Maltese Mini Mouses, while a Pug in a yellow and red tutu played with a Golden Retriever in a spotted bow-tie.

Hundreds of owners arrived to celebrate with their pets, although it was the dogs who were the better dressed of the two.

Canines dressed as everything from ladybirds and bumble bees to Superdogs and clowns found new furry friends at the annual Blocao - a play on the word for street party, 'bloco,' and dog, or 'cao' - which allows four-legged family members a chance to take part in the fun of Carnival.

About half the revelers at the Blacao were humans, the other half dogs, though it was the pets who were the better dressed of the two- such as this dog's Superman costume

The celebration is one of nearly 500 'blocos'- the raucous street parties that stop traffic in the run up to Rio de Janeiro's Carnival.

Revellers included a woman who has become an animal protection crusader in Brazil after a video of her two French bulldogs Gucci and Victoria being abused gained wide attention earlier this month.

A hidden camera caught the fiancé of Ninna Mandin severely beating her pets which prompted her to break off their engagement to protect her pooches.

On Saturday, she celebrated Carnival with her two dogs who were dressed as clowns.

Another insect-themed costume at the parade, which could rival the main Carnival for colour, is this ladybug
