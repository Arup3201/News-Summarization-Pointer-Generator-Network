When this tourist visited a South African game reserve, she was warned of the dangers ... but nobody told her she'd actually have to put her neck on the lion.

Lina Jek, 42, stopped for a selfie at Lion Park, in Johannesburg, when one of the locals photobombed the snap in terrifying - but adorable - style.

As she posed against the stunning backdrop of the African savannah, an eight-month-old lioness crept into frame and gave her a big hug and a kiss.

Neck on the lion: Lina Jek, 42, stopped for a selfie at Lion Park, in Johannesburg, when one of the locals photobombed the snap in terrifying - but adorable - style

The animal even stuck out her tongue and started licking Lina's left ear.

She couldn't help but laugh as her husband, Chris, snapped the once-in-a-lifetime image of the two cuddling up together.

The couple had been visiting the Lion Park near Johannesburg in South Africa where visitors can interact with the creatures up to the age of eight months.

They are then moved on to an adult-only section where they are not allowed to be handled by members of the public.

Chris, 50, a wildlife photographer from Johannesburg, said: 'In South Africa, there are many parks where the public can interact with wild animals.

Peaceful: Lion Park is a 2 km-square lion wildlife conservation enclosure in Gauteng province in South Africa and is home to over 80 lions including the rare white lions, among other species

'It is possible to have physical contact with elephants, cheetahs, monkeys or lion cubs.

'The lion park is a very small reserve that includes two enclosure for lion cubs from different litters.

'Visitors can enter the enclosures and interact with very young and cute lions, as young as two months old, and bolder visitors can visit lion 'teenagers'.

'When the lions are eight months old they are at the limit of age for interaction with the public.

'The one in this picture was eight months old a few days later, this lioness and her siblings where removed from the enclosure and taken to the adult lions part of the park.

'I took this picture as a lion put its paw on my wife's shoulder.

'One can play with the lions and there are quite a lot of opportunities to take dramatic pictures of interactions.

'She was delighted as she loves interaction with animals.'
