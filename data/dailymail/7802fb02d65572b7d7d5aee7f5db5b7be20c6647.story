Team news

Liverpool

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers will wait to see whether Daniel Sturridge is fit enough to be involved against West Brom.

The striker has missed six matches with a thigh strain and while he is edging closer to full fitness he has been left out of England's 2016 qualifiers due to his lack of action.

Defenders Glen Johnson and Mamadou Sakho (both thigh), Jon Flanagan (knee), midfielders Joe Allen (knee) and Emre Can (ankle) are all unavailable.

Provisional squad: Mignolet, Manquillo, Skrtel, Lovren, Moreno, Gerrard, Henderson, Lallana, Markovic, Balotelli, Sterling, Jones, Toure, Enrique, Coutinho, Rossiter, Lucas, Lambert, Borini.

West Brom

Silvestre Varela is out of West Brom's trip to Liverpool as the club assess whether he needs hernia surgery.

The Baggies are liasing with the winger's parent club Porto to see if Varela needs to go under the knife.

Strikers Brown Ideye (ankle) and Victor Anichebe (groin) are also sidelined meaning four-goal Saido Berahino will lead the line and Chris Baird is fit again after illness.

Provisional squad: Foster, Myhill, Pocognoli, Gamboa, Dawson, Lescott, McAuley, Olsson, Yacob, Davidson, Baird, Wisdom, Morrison, Mulumbu, Gardner, Dorrans, Brunt, Roofe, Blanco, Sessegnon, Samaras, Berahino.
