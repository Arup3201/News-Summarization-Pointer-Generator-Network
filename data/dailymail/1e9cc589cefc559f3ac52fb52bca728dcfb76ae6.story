A police community support officer who was accused of spanking a male colleague's backside while he moved a filing cabinet has been cleared of sexual assault.

A trial heard Josephine Browne, 50, had developed an 'unhealthy interest' with the fellow officer at a London police station, spying on him in a locker room and flashing her bra at him.

But today the jury at Southwark Crown Court took less than an hour to clear Browne of sexual assault.

Cleared: PCSO Josephine Browne, 50, has been cleared of sexual assault after a colleague accused her of spanking his backside six times. Tonight jurors were still undecided on a lesser charge of common assault

They were still considering a lesser charge of common assault, on which she could still be found guilty tomorrow if the jury decide she struck the young man on the backside without sexual intent.

During her two-day trial, it was also claimed Browne offered to massage the PCSO and behaved provocatively towards him in a lift during months of 
harassment.

Her accuser compared the alleged 
peeping incident as 'like something out of Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho 
movie' and said he felt more comfortable dealing with criminals.

He said the spanking incident, alleged
 to have occurred while he carried a filing cabinet through the 
building with a colleague, was 'the final straw' after months of 
harassment.

Defendant: Browne was accused of flashing her bra at an officer and 'seductively' leaned towards him

He was supported by a third PCSO who said she had witnessed the alleged slapping last year.

Prosecutor Leo Seelig, said previously: ‘All
 this attention was completely unwanted by him. As it happens, he is gay
 and it was upsetting and intimidating for him... Everyone, their 
colleagues, knew about it. That attention upset and intimidated him’.

But Browne, of Regents Park, north London, denied the allegations, insisting the incidents in question did not happen.

The former professional gardener denied having any sexual interest in her accuser, telling the court when she took the stand: 'I don’t find him attractive at all.'

She insisted she had a good relationship with the man and had 'no idea' why the allegations had been made.

Browne said she had 'banter' with other male officers in the shared locker room but remained adamant she had never behaved inappropriately towards or spied on her colleague.

Tessa Shroff, defending, told the jury today: 'Let’s be blunt about it. What the prosecution is alleging is that Miss Browne is a sex offender.

'None of this happened - it is absolute nonsense. That is what she (Browne) told you and she has nothing to prove.

'The prosecution has criticised her for being forgetful about whether she was ever on the same side of the locker room as (her accuser).

'If this is really the worst she has done, if that is the strength of the case against her then I would suggest to you that even the prosecution know this case is starting to slip.'

The court heard the changing room was split into male and 
female areas, and Browne would peer around a locker door and stare at the
 complainant while he was changing. 

‘Male’
 and ‘female’ signs were then put up in the changing rooms after the officer 
complained about Browne’s alleged behaviour.

Prosecution barrister Leo Seelig insisted the incidents were real and distressing, adding: 'That is the reason (the 
accuser) went to tell his supervisor having thought about it and that is
 why he was concerned and upset.

'He’s
 told you the truth from the witness box - he’s not an actor, he’s not 
come to lie about what has happened. He was slapped and if you’re sure 
about that she is guilty.

Trial: Browne denied sexual assault and an alternative count of common at Southwark Crown Court (pictured)

'There
 was a whole lot of sexual intent, a whole lot of provocative behaviour.
 It doesn’t matter whether he is gay, it was what she was doing.'

Speaking from the witness stand, Browne's accuser said: 'I was really shocked and I was like “oh 
my god” under my breath. I told her “stop, can you just stop and open 
the doors” and she continued - and I think there was about two or three 
more afterwards.'

But Ms Shoroff told the jury the alleged victim and the witness had both initially said the incident happened in February last year, though Browne did not join the same police station until two months later. It was later alleged the incident happened on August 18 last year.

She said: 'For one witness to get that wrong is one thing but for another to come up with the same incorrect month may give you concern.

'If you have doubt about the truthfulness of that, how do you feel about accepting their evidence about anything else?'

The jury will return to continue deliberating on the common assault charge tomorrow.
