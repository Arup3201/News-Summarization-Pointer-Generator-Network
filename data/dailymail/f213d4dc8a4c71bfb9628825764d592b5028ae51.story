The NFL says its investigation into whether the New England Patriots used under-inflated footballs in the AFC championship game is ongoing after a report Tuesday night claimed the league found 11 balls were not properly inflated.

Troy Vincent, the NFL's executive vice president for football operations, told The Associated Press that the 'investigation is currently underway and we're still awaiting findings.'

Vincent was responding to an ESPN report that cited anonymous league sources saying 11 of the Patriots' 12 allotted game footballs were under-inflated by 2 pounds.

Big moment: Indianapolis Colts linebacker D'Qwell Jackson's interception against the New England Patriots (pictured) reportedly caused the Colts to first look into what is being called 'Deflategate' 

Official probe: A referee checks a ball during the AFC Championship game on Sunday night 

Patriots spokesman Stacey James told ESPN: 'We have been in complete cooperation with the league and will continue to do so.'  

Vincent said earlier Tuesday he expected the probe to be concluded by the end of the week. The last thing the NFL wants after a difficult season off the field is a potential cheating scandal that disrupts Super Bowl week. New England faces the Seattle Seahawks on February 1 in Glendale, Arizona.

In 2007, a New England Patriots assistant was caught filming New York Jets coaches as they gave signals on defensive plays. 

The revelation resulted in a massive NFL investigation that found the Patriots guilty of cheating. The scandal was dubbed 'Spygate.' 

Head coach Bill Belichick admitted to taping opposing coaches' signals dating back to 2000 - his entire tenure with the Patriots. 

He claimed that he believed the practice was allowed within the rules of the NFL, as long as the tape was reviewed after the game. 

The NFL levied a $500,000 fine against Belichick, the heftiest in the league's history. 

The team was also fined $250,000 and stripped of their first-round pick in the 2008 draft.

The Patriots, who beat Indianapolis 45-7 for the AFC title, said they were cooperating with the league, and a Seahawks spokesman said the team would defer to the league on the matter

The NFL began looking into the issue not only because doctoring the footballs could provide a competitive advantage, but because it would compromise the integrity of the game.

Deflating a football can change the way it's gripped by a player or the way it travels through the air. Under NFL rules, each team provides balls each game for use when its offense is on the field. The balls are inspected before the game by the officiating crew, then handled during the game by personnel provided by the home team.

The Colts reached out to the NFL after a team staff member had concerns regarding a football intercepted by Colts player D'Qqwell Jackson, according to Newsday.

The Patriots have been brushing off and even finding humor in questions about whether they used under-inflated footballs in the game that put them in the Super Bowl. 

Referee Walt Anderson was spotted replacing a ball at the start of the third quarter, returning it to the sidelines, although it was not confirmed whether this was linked to the inflation issue.

The investigation has been referred to as 'Deflategate' online and by numerous news outlets.

Jackson's interception took place in the second quarter and the Colts first noticed something unusual afterward, Newsday reported. The news outlet referred to an individual familiar with background.

A Colts equipment staff member was handed the ball by Jackson and noticed that it seemed under-inflated, Newsday reported. Colts coach Chuck Pagano was informed by the staff member, according to the report.

Ryan Grigson, the Colts general manager, was alerted before he reached out to NFL director of football operations Mike Kensil, who in turn spoke to on-field officials during the AFC championship game's halftime, according to the Newsday report. 

Social media responses were quick late Tuesday night and into Wednesday morning.

'11 of 12 balls under-inflated can anyone spell cheating!!! (hash)Just Saying' was the tweet from Hall of Fame receiver Jerry Rice.

'So we get to play the game again or nah? ??' tweeted Colts cornerback Darius Butler.

Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers said on ESPN radio in Milwaukee that he didn't like how referees who inspected balls before games take air out of the game balls.

'I have a major problem with the way it goes down, to be honest with you,' Rodgers said. 'The majority of the time, they take air out of the football. I think that, for me, is a disadvantage.'

Rodgers said referees have a set range in which they 'like to set game balls,' and that he always liked the higher end of the range because of his grip.

'I just have a hard time throwing a flat football,' Rodgers said. He thought a slight majority of quarterbacks like footballs on the flatter side.

'My belief is that there should be a minimum air-pressure requirement but not a maximum,' Rodgers said. 'There's no advantage, in my opinion. We're not kicking the football. There's no advantage in having a pumped-up football.'

Patriots quarterback Tom Brady told WEEI, 'I think I’ve heard it all at this point. That’s the least of my worries. I don’t even respond to stuff like this.'

Inquiry: Belichick has said he wasn't aware there was an issue until Monday morning and promised to 'cooperate fully with whatever the league wants us to, whatever questions they ask' 

Explanation? New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowksi tweeted this photo of himself spiking the ball with the words: 'WARNING GRONKING MAY CAUSE DEFLATION'

Flat: Balls for the Superbowl next month wait to be laced and pumped up at the Wilson Sporting Goods Co. in Ada, Ohio

And tight end Rob Gronkowski tweeted a photo of himself spiking the ball with the words: 'WARNING GRONKING MAY CAUSE DEFLATION.'

Belichick on Tuesday deferred questions about the investigation, saying reporters should ask league officials. NFL officials declined comment except to say the investigation was still pending.

Belichick earlier said he wasn't aware there was an issue until Monday morning and promised to 'cooperate fully with whatever the league wants us to, whatever questions they ask.'

Belichick, of course, was fined $500,000 in 2007 for having an assistant spy on the New York Jets' defensive signals. 

The NFL's investigation was first reported by WTHR.  

Special teams captain Matthew Slater said the Patriots 'try to do things the right way. We work hard at our jobs, our professions, to be successful and it's unfortunate that things like this come up, but that's life, that's the world we live in.'

Colts coach Chuck Pagano said he did not notice issues with the football and didn't specify when asked whether the Colts had reported the issue to officials.

'We talk just like they talk to officials (before the game),' he said. 'We have an opportunity to talk to the officials about a lot of things.'

Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman said the balls didn't feel different than usual.

And defensive tackle Vince Wilfork seemed amused by the matter and didn't shed any light on it.

'I don't know anything about that,' he said. "I don't touch footballs. I tackle people.'
