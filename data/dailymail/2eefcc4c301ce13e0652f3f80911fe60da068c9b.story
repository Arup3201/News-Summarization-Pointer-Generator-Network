Civil rights groups today voiced major concern over a defence bill allowing the military to indefinitely detain U.S. citizens suspected of terrorism.

The $662billion bill was signed by Barack Obama on Saturday despite his ‘serious reservations’ and pledging he would not support that element.

But human rights advocates said the bill is a ‘blight on his legacy’ and ‘dangerous because it has no temporal or geographic limitations’.

‘Obama will go down in history as the President who enshrined indefinite detention without trial in U.S. law,’ a Human Rights Watch spokesman said.

The American Civil Liberties Union is ‘incredibly disappointed’ but will see what the Supreme Court rules on the ‘scope of detention authority’.

‘The statute can be used by this and future presidents to militarily detain people captured far from any battlefield,’ an ACLU spokesman added.

Civil rights advocates are worried the bill will help the military detain and interrogate U.S. citizens and non-citizens, reported the Washington Post.

President Obama claimed some lawmakers wanted to use the bill to restrict counter-terrorism officials’ ability to protect the country.

He only signed the measure after Congress made changes that no longer challenged his terrorism-fighting ability, administration officials said.

‘My administration will not authorise the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens,’ President Obama said.

‘Indeed, I believe that doing so would 
break with our most important traditions and values as a nation,’ he 
wrote in a signing statement.

The defence bill also applies penalties against Iran's central bank in an effort to hamper its ability to fund its nuclear programme.

His signature caps months of wrangling over how to handle captured terrorist suspects without violating Americans' constitutional rights.

The White House initially threatened to veto the legislation but dropped the warning after Congress made some last-minute changes.

The new law requires military custody 
for any suspect who is a member of Al Qaeda or ‘associated forces’ and 
involved in trying to attack the U.S.

But the President or a designated 
subordinate may waive the military custody requirement by telling 
Congress it’s for national security reasons.

Despite the changes, officials cited 
serious concerns that the law will complicate and could harm the 
investigation of terrorism cases.

FBI officials have said they could have trouble persuading suspected terrorists to co-operate immediately and provide critical intelligence.

The $662billion bill authorises money for elements such as military personnel, weapons systems and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

'The implications for Guantanamo (Bay) are quite simple,' an Amnesty International spokesman told The Independent. 'It is staying open now.'

'This effectively enshrines indefinite detention in American law permanently,' the spokesman added.
