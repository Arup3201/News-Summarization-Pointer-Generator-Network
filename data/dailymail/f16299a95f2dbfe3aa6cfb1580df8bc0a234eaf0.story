Incarcerated Australian journalist Peter Greste, who has been locked up in an Egyptian jail for 327 days, could be pardoned by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.

The parents of Mr Greste have new hope that intervention by the  president could see their son home for Christmas.

But the hope of Lois and Juris Greste is tempered by the frustrations experienced over the past 11 months.

'We have had very promising indications before that Peter will be back home with his family very, very soon,' Juris Greste told reporters in Brisbane on Friday.

Journalist Peter Greste has been held in an Egyptian jail for 327 days 

'We just have to remain patient and hope for the best.' 

The Egyptian president said on Friday that the possibility of releasing three jailed Al-Jazeera journalists was being considered. 

'This issue is under study,' he told France 24.

Asked if they will be pardoned soon, he said: 'If we find that this is appropriate for Egyptian national security, then we will do it.'

Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told the ABC that Sisi's comments are a welcome step forward.

'If there are indications from the Egyptian president that he will do that [consider a pardon] prior to the hearing of the appeal then we would welcome that,' she said.

Mr Greste is being held along with Canadian-Egyptian national Mohamed Fahmy and Egyptian Baher Mohamed, all from the Qatar-based television network Al Jazeera.

They were detained in December and convicted six months later in June of spreading lies to help a 'terrorist organisation'.

Al Jazeera said the accusations against the three journalists are absurd.

On Thursday a spokesman for the TV network told the ABC: 'The Egyptian authorities have it in their power to release our journalists.

'World opinion expects this to happen speedily, and for all three to be freed.'

Sisi issued a decree last week allowing him to repatriate foreign prisoners when it was in his country's 'supreme interests'.

Greste's boss, Al Jazeera English chief Al Anstey, called it another part of the confusing and unfair process.

'It defies logic, it defies justice they're still behind bars,' 9 News reported.

Western governments and human rights groups have condemned the case, with the United Nations questioning Egypt's reputation and the independence of its judiciary.

The three journalists are appealing the convictions on the grounds of flawed evidence.

Greste's parents Lois and Juris said they would be visiting Egypt around Peter's birthday on December 1

'They had videos from other news organisations, family photos, they had the Gotye music video. It was totally irrelevant to the case,' Anstey said.

The trio will have been behind bars for more than a year when they next appear in court on January 1 to decide if their appeal will go ahead.

Sisi said in July that he wished the imprisoned Al Jazeera journalists had been deported and not put on trial.

Anstey, who was in Sydney last week to meet with Greste's family and campaign for his release, is concerned about the prisoners' appalling confinement.

'They're living a nightmare every second of every day. They've got to be set free,' he said, 9News reported.

Sisi initially reacted to the journalists' sentencing by saying he would not interfere in court verdicts.
