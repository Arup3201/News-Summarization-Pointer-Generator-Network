Fed up with our perpetually soggy weather? Then here’s some news to further dampen your spirits.

Forecasters warned yesterday that the country faces even more intense downpours in future years, with increased risks of flooding.

The number of days of ‘extreme rainfall’ – particularly heavy downpours – increased by 40 per cent last year, making 2012 the UK’s second wettest year ever.

Extreme flooding: Only part of a road can be seen above the flood water from the River Ouse near Cawood, North Yorkshire, a sight which may become less shocking according to forecasters

Extreme rainfall should occur once every 100 days, but last year it happened every 70 days, or almost once every two months.

The
top five wettest years since records began in 1910 are 2000, 2012, 
1954, 2008 and 2002 – meaning four of the five have occurred since the 
beginning of this century.

Professor
Julia Slingo, chief scientist at the Met Office, said: ‘The trend 
towards more extreme rainfall events is one we are seeing around the 
world, in countries such as India and China, and now potentially here in
the UK.

‘It’s essential we 
look at how this may affect rainfall patterns over the next decade and 
beyond, so we can advise on the frequency of extreme weather in the 
future and the potential for more surface and river flooding.’

Annual
rainfall increased by 5 per cent in the 30-year period between 
1981-2010 when compared to 1961-1990. But last year alone, the average 
rainfall was up 15 per cent.

Increasingly wet: Heavy downpours, resulting in scenes like this in York New Years day, have become more common in the past 13 years

Blame the climate change: Increased sea-surface temperatures and melting ice bergs in the Arctic could be behind the wet weather

Mother Nature's fault: Although it is easy to blame climate change some experts say extreme weather is merely a result of natural variation

Figures released by the Met Office 
show last year’s total rainfall was 52½ inches across Britain, just a 
quarter of an inch less than the wettest ever year, 2000.

Broken
down into the countries that make up the UK, England experienced its 
wettest year since records began with just over 44 inches, an inch more 
than in 2000. Wales saw its third wettest year in 2012, and it was 
Scotland’s 17th.

Met Office 
forecasters said changes in sea surface temperatures and reducing 
amounts of Arctic sea-ice could be influencing the increase in rainfall.

Another
theory is that the 0.7C increase in global temperatures since 
pre-industrial times is causing the wet weather because a warmer 
atmosphere can hold more moisture, leading to the greater risk of heavy 
rain.

Soon less weird: Sights such as this, two people canoeing through Aberfoyle, Scotland in November last year, could become increasingly common if forecasters are to be believed

Met Office forecaster Dan Williams said: ‘At the moment, we do not have a definitive answer to why Britain has had so many wet years since 2000. It could be down to natural variation or it could be other factors, including potential increases in global temperatures.’

Professor Nigel Arnell of Reading University said we are likely to see more flooding in the future.

He said: ‘Rainfall has increased in recent decades over many parts of the Northern Hemisphere and we’re seeing rain falling in heavier bursts. 2012 for the UK fits with that picture and we’ve seen the effect of all this rain with disruptive flooding across many parts of the country.’

With four of the five wettest years on record occurring since 2000, many were quick to blame climate change for the increased rainfall.

Wetter than ever: England experienced it's wettest year since records began in 2012

But some experts suggested it was just a result of natural variation, with a similar pattern of wet weather also occurring in the 1950s. Britain’s third highest annual rainfall was recorded in 1954, while two other years in the decade are amongst the 20 wettest.

One theory is that in both the 1950s and the past decade warmer than usual sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic altered the jet stream, causing wet weather to remain over Britain for longer periods of time.

Two men were taken to hospital with head injuries yesterday after falling into a flooded river when a footbridge collapsed.

The pair, aged 65 and 55, were pulled from the River Seven at High Askew near Cropton on the North York Moors. They were believed to have been part of a shooting party.
