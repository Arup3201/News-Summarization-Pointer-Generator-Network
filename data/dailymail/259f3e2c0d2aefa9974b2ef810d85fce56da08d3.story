With no leads and no motive, California investigators have turned to the public for help in finding the person who killed a 3-week-old baby girl found in a dumpster after shooting her family.

Long Beach Police Chief Robert Luna said the lack of direction in the investigation and the dearth of information from the injured victims was frustrating.

'If you're talking about a crime that occurred at 6pm on a Saturday in a highly dense, congested residential area, somebody had to have seen or heard something,' Luna said at a Monday news conference.

Mystery death: Three-week-old Eliza Delacruz was found dead inside a dumpster near the Mexican border after her parents and uncle were wounded in a shooting. Three days later, police still have no clues

Road trip: The gunman drove for 120 miles from Long Beach, where the three people were shot, to Imperial Beach on the Mexican border, where Eliza's body was found in a dumpster

The baby's parents and uncle have spoken with police but it was too early to know if the family was withholding clues, Luna said.

Detectives do not believe the crime was a random act, and the FBI is assisting in the investigation, Luna said.

The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors today offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction.

'Every homicide is important, but when you have a homicide that deals with a 3-week-old baby, that just takes it to a different level,' Luna told reporters.   

Long Beach detectives have only a limited description of the culprit and are looking for a man who is either black or Hispanic. 

They don't have a description of a car or a license plate number, so they were unable to issue an Amber Alert over the weekend for the missing newborn, Eliza Delacruz.

Luna said nothing is being ruled out at this point, including that the gunman has fled to Mexico, or that family members or a drug cartel are involved.

The mother and uncle remained hospitalized in critical condition Monday. The father was released Sunday and is now staying at an undisclosed location.

'We don't have the complete picture yet, but we're going to get there,' Luna said.

A transient found the body of the 10-pound baby girl Sunday in a trash bin behind a strip mall in the 600 block of Palm Drive in Imperial Beach, a two-hour drive south of the Long Beach neighborhood where her father, mother and uncle were shot. 

Mourners erected a makeshift memorial of candles, flowers, teddy bears and pink balloons outside a pizza shop at the mall.

'To take a precious child from home, throw her in a dumpster like a piece of trash, is something only a very heartless person would do,' Luna said. 'We need to get the coward who committed this violent, senseless act off the street, but we absolutely need the public’s help to do this.'

Long Beach police Lt. Lloyd Cox said the deceased child's family are keeping mum for fear of retaliation. 

The San Diego County medical examiner's office said it was unknown where or when the infant died. An autopsy had not yet been performed, and no cause of death was released.

Long Beach Police Chief Robert Luna said the crime took place in a densely populated residential area in early evening, which means that somebody had to have seen or heard something 

Aaron Cruz, who lives next door to the victims' two-story stucco house in the 100 block of West 51st Street, said the baby's father is a veterinary technician who works six days a week and was thrilled to be a dad.

Cruz, who described himself as the man's best friend, said the family often hosted large barbecues on their front lawn after moving in a few years ago.

The baby's parents and uncle lived there with another uncle and the baby's grandparents, but no one else was there when the shooting happened, Cruz said.

'He had just gotten off work, and this happened to him. It was a normal day for him,' he said. 'This was out of nowhere.'

Cruz recalled a large baby shower with dancing that the family threw in November.

'It was his first and only daughter,' Cruz said, as he relit candles that had fizzled out in the breeze. 'He was robbed of fatherhood.'
