A mother and daughter have won national beauty contests after they were inspired to lose weight from 'shocking' holiday photos.

Tiffany Brown, 20, has been named Miss Northumberland, while her mother Lisa has won the UK body figure and fitness (BFF) title for over-35s.

And the pair from Ulgham, near Morpeth, both embarked on a fitness journey and changed their lifestyles to achieve their admirable feats.

Lisa, 47, was not a stranger to the fitness world, having first competed in body building contests in the 1990s, but raising a family put a stop to her competing.

But she hadn't stepped foot in a gym for more than 20 years when in 2012, she decided things had to change.

'I went on holiday with my husband Phil and when we came home I looked at our holiday photos,' Lisa said. 

'I was horrified at how much weight I had gained over the years, and I knew something needed to change.

'At this stage my son Rick Hall had become really involved with the gym and fitness lifestyle. He was well on his way to becoming a champion himself.

'We all went to see him compete and once I was sitting in that crowd something just clicked.

'It was the inspiration I needed. I realised that training hard and being on stage was something still close to my heart.'

Rick, who runs his Protein Card business in Newcastle, helped his mother prepare her meals and train until it became second nature to her.

Two years later, she picked up the trophy in Nottingham.

Lisa said: 'My age didn't discourage me - I feel younger than ever. 

'I combine progressive weight and cardio training and I follow a strict diet in which I only eat natural whole foods. It means I'm never hungry and I feel so energetic.

'I feel like I could live until I'm 100!'

Lisa, who now works with Rick and has slimmed down from a size 12 to a size six to eight, was so inspired that when Tiffany had a similar life-changing realisation, she was eager to help.

New Miss Northumberland Tiffany said: 'When I was younger I did some modelling and was a dancer but when I had my son Charlie 14 months ago, I put on a lot of weight. 

'I lost my self-confidence - I didn't go out the house. When my son got christened in February, I looked back at the few pictures I let people take of me and thought, "am I really that big?"

'My mum helped me lose five stone and after I managed to lose the weight, I felt like I wanted something to show for that hard work.'

Unbeknownst to her family, Tiffany decided to apply to Galaxy Pageants UK and weeks later she was selected from hundreds of applications to represent Northumberland in the 'Miss' category.

Judges complimented her 'striking eyes and hair'.

In February 2015, she will compete for the national crown of Miss England in Lancashire and the chance to travel to Orlando, Florida, for the international Miss Galaxy contest.

The trainee mortgage advisor, who is now 9st 7lb, added: 'I am still in shock I have made it and that I applied at all. I guess I was having a brave day and just went for it.

'It is great for my self confidence and I feel like I am getting back to my old self now. It is a great reward for achieving all my weight loss. Now I have people ringing me for photo shoots.'

The Morpeth beauty is now planning North East charity events with the help of the competition, and her chosen cause is the Children's Heart Unit at the Freeman Hospital (CHUF).

Meanwhile, Lisa is training to take part in the IFBB Arnold World Championships, named after former Mr Olympia Arnold Schwarzenegger, in Ohio next year.

Dad Phil Brown, 55, said he was very proud of their achievements.

The independent financial advisor said: 'They have both shown a lot of focus and dedication - not giving up when the weather is cold and dark in the morning.

'To lose the weight they have is a fantastic achievement in itself but then to go further and earn their respective honours is quite something.'

When asked how he intends to keep up, Phil said: 'I have lost 2st myself but am too busy with work to do what they have done.

'I do eat healthier now but that is mainly because I have to eat what they eat!'
