David Cameron is expected to miss a vote on the controversial  ban on people smoking in cars when they have children with them, because of the floods.

The proposal will be subject to a free vote in the Commons and is likely to highlight differences of opinion within the coalition  - allowing MPs the opportunity to make a decision without following party orders.

But the Prime Minister is expected to miss the vote as he leads the Government's response to the flooding.

Mr Cameron has not stated his position on the ban, with his spokesman previously insisting the PM wanted to 'listen to the arguments'.

But previously he has spoken on the subject, in 2011.

He said: ‘Whatever people have done in the past, the facts show that they really
 should change their behaviour.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, pictured last night in Mexico City, warned the ban was illiberal and unenforceable

Split:  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said he
 will back a call for 
parents to be banned from smoking in cars containing children but Lib 
Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable will vote against the law

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is to back a ban, after previously warning it was not the state's tole to dictate what people do in private

Nick Clegg,
 the cigarette-smoking Deputy Prime Minister:‘A family speeding along 
the M4 and mum or dad are smoking, how on earth are you going to 
properly enforce that?’ 

Ken Clarke,
 the cigar-smoking minister without portfolio: ‘I don't think our 
traffic police are going to be concentrating enormous efforts on racing 
up and down the motorway peering into cars, trying to see whether 
there's a child in.'

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles: ‘My initial intention is to vote against it. We should make things criminal if we feel that they are enforceable.’

Public Health Minister Jane Ellison: ‘We are not persuaded that legislation is the right way forward on that matter.’ (November 2013)

Chief Whip Sir George Young: ‘I see some difficulties in trying to enforce a ban on all smoking in cars.’ (November 2011, when Commons leader)

Prime Minister David Cameron:
 ‘Whatever people have done in the past, the facts show that they really
 should change their behaviour. I am not sure whether it is possible to 
legislate in that area - we need a change in attitudes.’ (March 2011)

Defence Minister Anna Soubry,
 an ex-smoker: ‘I would ban smoking in cars where children are present. I
 would see it as a child welfare issue. I think it is something we 
should at least consider as government.’ (February 2013,  when public 
health minister)

'I am not sure whether it is possible to 
legislate in that area - we need a change in attitudes.’

Deputy
 Prime Minister Nick Clegg signalled he would not back the plan when he 
told his weekly phone-in show that 'laws and legislation are not always 
the solution'.

He said a ban would not be enforceable in practice, adding: 'We have to live in a society where we expect adults to behave like adults and we expect parents to behave like responsible parents.

'You can't sub-contract responsible parenting to the state. It is deeply irresponsible to smoke in an enclosed space with your kids - don't do it.'

It
 follows the House of Lords backing an amendment giving Health Secretary
 Jeremy Hunt power to make it a criminal offence in England, punishable 
by a £60 fine or points on a motorist’s licence.

But Transport Minister Robert Goodwill told MPs last week he would vote in favour of the ban, having been forced to sit in the back of a car as a child while his father smoked.

David Nuttall, Tory MP for Bury North, told the Commons the ban could divert the attention of the police away from more important road offences.

Fellow Conservative Jacob Rees-Mogg said he would not back the plan, as he noted it could allow the Government to regulate other legal activities.

The MP for North East Somerset, was writing in the Mail on Sunday.

He said: 'Once it is admitted that the State can intrude on people's legal activities, then it is hard to establish the point at which it must stop.'

He went on: 'I am very fortunate in having a marvellous nanny, Miss Veronica Cook, who after 47 years is still looking after my family.

'Nothing is more reliable than nanny, nor more objectionable than the nanny state.'

Dr Penny Woods, British Lung Foundation chief executive, said a ban on smoking in cars carrying children is successfully enforced in several countries, including Canada and Australia.

She said: 'MPs have a real chance of making history by voting to give children in the UK the same protection.'

Dr Woods added she hoped 'common-sense will prevail'.
