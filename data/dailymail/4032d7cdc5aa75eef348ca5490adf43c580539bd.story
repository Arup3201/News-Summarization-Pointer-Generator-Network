It all comes down to silverware. When everything is said and done, progress at Anfield is gauged by how many trophies a manager can collect. It always will be.

As someone who grew up in a family of Liverpool supporters during the club’s most successful period, Brendan Rodgers - who celebrated his 42nd birthday on Monday - is fully aware of what is expected when this side get to a semi-final: they have to finish the job.

So it was interesting to hear the message Rodgers relayed at Liverpool’s Melwood training ground. Chelsea might currently be the best team in the country but there was no sign of concern as Rodgers explained how he intends to navigate a path to Wembley.

Rodgers has impressed with the work he has done since arriving in June 2012 but now, with his philosophies in place, the moment is approaching where Liverpool have to press on. 

An opportunity awaits at Stamford Bridge and Rodgers does not intend to let it pass.

‘We respect the opponent, of course, because they’re a very good team,’ said Rodgers. ‘But we’ve got nothing to fear in the game. We’re a team that’s in a good moment. 

'We’re playing well, we’re working well and we know we can go there and win — that’s key.’

That has been the mantra since the first leg of this Capital One Cup semi-final ended in a 1-1 draw last week. 

The team Rodgers played then had an average age of 24½, which suggests their best years are in the future, but collecting a trophy now would be huge for its development.

‘The manager spoke to us before the first game and said it is always the first trophy that helps you start something,’ explained Lucas Leiva, the in-form Brazil midfielder. ‘He is looking for that first medal to put a mark on the group.

‘We were fantastic in the Premier League last season but at the end we didn’t win. This group deserves something good and a medal to show how hard it works, and for the fans as well. We have a good history with Chelsea, back to the Champions League when Rafa Benitez was here.’

Since the Benitez era, Liverpool have inflicted some heavy blows on Chelsea — they knocked them out in the quarter-finals of this competition in November 2011 — but the really decisive matches (the 2012 FA Cup final and the pivotal Premier League meeting at Anfield last April) have ended with Blue being the colour.

‘Of course Chelsea will always be in the way of what we want to achieve because they are a big club,’ said Lucas, who has become something of a talisman, with the club being unbeaten in the last 14 games in which he has started. ‘They are the same as Manchester United, Arsenal and Manchester City. When you get towards finals, you have to play them. Hopefully this time it will go our way.’

Mention of that League Cup quarter-final evokes strong emotions for Lucas. He was in the best form of his career then but a ruptured cruciate ligament inflicted more damage than he could have envisaged, as it took what seemed an eternity to recapture his confidence and the belief of Rodgers.

Recently Inter Milan expressed interest in him but no bid materialised and Rodgers, having restored Lucas to the team, maintained he did not want to lose a player who, in his youth, won the Bola de Ouro, Brazil’s Player of the Year award.

‘I just have to focus on what I can control and see what happens,’ said Lucas. ‘I would be lying if I said I never thought about something new but I can’t tell you what is going to happen. I just focus on the day and leave the future to take care of itself.’

The focus on Tuesday is helping Liverpool reach their 12th League Cup final. Although injured, he was in the party that travelled for the 11th, which ended with a penalty shootout victory over Cardiff City in February 2012, but felt on the periphery of the celebrations. This time he wants to experience it for real.

‘It was hard for me,’ said Lucas. ‘When we were on our way to the stadium of course I was a bit down because I wanted to be part of it on the pitch and I remember Stevie Gerrard sending me a text which said, “Don’t worry, we will get here again”. It is something I always remember and hopefully we will make that come true. That would be special.’
