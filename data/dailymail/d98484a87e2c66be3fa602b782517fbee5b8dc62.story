A woman who was shot dead with her two young children and her mother by her estranged police officer husband texted a friend to say she couldn't stand his rage just hours before the tragedies.

After returning from a Christmas break to Disneyworld, Joshua Boren killed Kelly Boren, 32, her mother Marie King, 55, his son Jaden, seven, and daughter Haley, five, at their home in Utah.

The five bodies were discovered in bedrooms after Boren, 34, failed to turn up for a night shift. The murder victims are being laid to rest on Wednesday, while Josh will be buried on Thursday.

Now friends have spoken to the Salt Lake Tribune about Mrs Boren's fears and frustrations with her husband - and how she claimed she was about to file for divorce.

One of her workout partners, RiRi Whiting, had helped persuade Kelly to separate from Joshua a few months before the killings.

That day, Kelly, who was British, sent Whiting a text saying she had decided to get a divorce and couldn't stand her husband's rage anymore, Whiting told the Tribune.

Whiting asked her what she meant and Kelly said she would explain later that night at the gym - but she never showed up.

The separation was nothing new, Archuleta said, explaining that in 2010, Joshua had slept on the couch for six months as Kelly considered divorcing him.

Another friend, Stacy Archuleta, said that 'many other people in our community knew of these problems, and none of us dared to go to anybody'.

She added that Kelly had told her that she was unhappy and felt unsafe, but urged her friend not to tell anyone in case it affected chances of reconciliation, the Tribune reported.

'I wish I would have said something back then,' Archuleta said. 'I was afraid I would upset her.'

Police have said they were never called to the home over the four years the family living in Spanish Fork, but friends claim Kelly said her husband was abusive.

Friends said that the couple had been going to events together and had a counseling session planned for the week of their deaths.

The revelations come after Kelly's father spoke out about the murder-suicide, calling it 'unimaginable.'

Jeff King said two Davis County sheriffs rand his doorbell to give him the shocking news.

'Police show up at your door in the early hours and tell you your only child is dead, your grandchildren are dead, your ex-wife is dead and the son-in-law you trusted and counted on to look after your child is...' the Layton man said Monday.

'You look for understanding, and there is none,' King told the Deseret News. 'You can't describe how you're feeling. ...They were my whole world.'

Boren's colleagues became concerned at around 11 p.m. Thursday when the officer didn't show up for work at 10 p.m.

They went to check on him and spotted blood and shell casings on the carpet through the window of the family's Spanish Fork home.

After officers entered the house, they discovered 'a large quantity of blood on the stairway leading to the second floor of the residence.'

Marie King was found dead in one upstairs bedroom. Kelly Boren, Josh Boren and their children were in another.
