Her appearance on The X Factor panel may only be temporary, but Rita Ora is making sure she makes a lasting impression.

The Kosovo-born star chose a bright orange outfit as she joined judges Tulisa Contostavlos, Louis Walsh and Gary Barlow for a second day on the panel at London's O2 Arena.

The pop newcomer, 21, stood out from the crowd in an eye-catching vintage Thierry Mugler jacket, Christian Blanken trousers and towering Christian Louboutin heels.

Following a successful Monday on the panel, Rita was invited back again today - but could only do a half-day because she was supporting Coldplay in concert in Coventry later this evening.

She wrote on Twitter this morning: 'Good Morning X Factor day 2 only half day then straight on a helicopter to coventry for COLDPLAY! Work Work Work! YES!!!

'Today surrounded by the talented @officialtulisa @radioleasy @gbarlowofficial & the 1 & only Louis Walsh thanks 4 makin' me feel so welcome!'

After her half-day, Rita jumped in a private jet to dash up to the Midlands, leaving Nicole Scherzinger to take her place in the afternoon.

Good impression: The 21-year-old pleased bosses on Monday so was invited back for a second day - albeit a half-day

Rita tweeted a photo of herself by her private plane: 'Just left the O2 thank you so much @xfactor and everyone there for having me! Jumping straight on a plane to do a show with coldplay!'

At the auditions, a wannabe singer stormed the stage without following correct audition procedures and tried to have his own moment in the spotlight.

As he tried to belt out a song, Tulisa pointed out: 'There are people waiting back stage who have been queueing here for hours. They have gone through the proper process. It's not fair on them.'

Rita's temporary addition to the judging panel has caused some controversy because she is so new to the charts herself.

Although she scored her first No.1 with R.I.P. earlier this month - it was her first solo single ever to be released in the UK.

She previously was a featured artist on singles by DJ Fresh and Craig David.

However, Tulisa defended Rita's place on the judges' table: 'Rita is great for the panel. Despite just breaking the commercial scene, she's been in the industry for years and knows what she's talking about.'

News of Rita's popularity will come as a blow to Geri Halliwell, who was hoping to land the spot permanently after Kelly Rowland's departure

However, she failed to impress at last week's Liverpool auditions and show bosses are said to have ruled out the former Spice Girls star joining the ITV show.

A source told The Sun newspaper: 'Geri had a lot of energy and tried her hardest to make an impression.

'But you need chemistry with the other judges in spades if you are going to join the panel full time.'
