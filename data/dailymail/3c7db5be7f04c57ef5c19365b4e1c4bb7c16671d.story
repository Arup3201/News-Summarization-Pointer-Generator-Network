A Republican state senator from Maine is in hot water after posting an image on Facebook that suggested U.S. President Barack Obama is going easy on the ISIS terror army because it includes some of his family.

The posting plays on the discredited conspiracy theory that holds Obama is secretly practicing Muslim.

'Why haven't I done anything about ISIS? Because I'll deal with them at the family reunion,' its caption reads.

Willette, a part-time lawmaker who makes his living selling real estate, shared it March 1 on his Facebook wall.'

'I've been very good over the last year and a half about not posting things about Obama, but this one was too good to pass up,' he wrote in the posting. 'I promise this will be the last one for some time.'

Willette apparently found it on the 'Conservative News Today' Facebook feed, which supplies a daily diet of anti-Obama, anti-Clinton and anti-Islam material including 'meme' photos, videos and cartoons.

ISIS, the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, is an army of terrorists that occupies more than two-thirds of Syria and Iraq.

The group counts tens of thousands of fighters among its ranks, including many drawn from other Middle Eastern and European nations.

Its soldiers have been seen in gruesome videos, beheading captured prisoners and burning them alive.

President Obama has embraced a 'coalition' approach of airstrikes to fight ISIS, but has not authorized the Pentagon to deploy American ground troops in the region.

In a prepared statement on Monday, he apologized for posting the item – but didn't say whether he still agreed with it.

It was no longer on his Facebook page as of Monday afternoon. 

'COMMON SENSE': Mike Willette's campaign postcards from the 2014 election season called him a 'rare breed of public servant'

'I apologize for posting this on Facebook,' Willette's statement read. 'Like too many people these days, I fell into the trap of posting something first and then thinking later. It was an error in judgment.'

The Maine Democratic Party pounced on the scandal, saying Willette's behavior was 'extremely disappointing and shows a severe lack of judgement.'

Party chairman Phil Bartlett's statement slammed Willette for perpetuating a 'false racial, religious and ethnic slur at a time when our state and country should come together.'

'This reflects very poorly on the Maine Republican Party and we urge their leadership to denounce Sen. Willette's actions,' wrote party chairman Phil Bartlett.

Willette himself was a Democrat until 2010, according to the Bangor Daily News. He switched parties when the GOP took over control of the state Senate.
