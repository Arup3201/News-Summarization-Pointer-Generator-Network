The number of millionaires in Asia outnumbered those in North America for the first time last year, latest figures show.

The Asia-Pacific region was home to 3.37 
million high net-worth individuals, defined as having at least 
$1 million to invest, according to the report by Capgemini and Royal 
Bank of Canada.

The figure, a 1.6 percent increase on the 
previous year, was boosted by an increase in rich people in China, Japan, 
Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.

By comparison North America's wealthy population fell by 1.1 per cent to 3.35 million.

However the continent still held the biggest share of world wealth at $11.4 trillion, even though it was down 2.3 per cent.

The rise in the Asian super rich came despite declining fortunes among the world's wealthy due to turbulent financial markets.

Yet although the number of wealthy Asian individuals rose, their combined wealth shrank 1.1 per cent to $10.7 trillion.

Europe, which was overtaken by Asia in 2009, came third with 3.17 millionaires worth $10.1 trillion.

Overall, the combined wealth of the world's 11 million rich declined 1.7 percent in 2011 to $42 trillion.Â 

The top three economies, U.S, Japan and Germany, retained 53.3 per cent of the total share of HNWIs, slightly up from 53.1 per cent in 2010

The contraction came as financial markets grew more volatile over widespread concerns about the European sovereign debt crisis.

Markets were also unsettled by a downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating and unrest in Arab countries that kept oil prices high. In Asia, rising inflation, shrinking exports and natural disasters such as Japan's devastating tsunami added to market turbulence.

The world's superrich, defined as worth $30 million or more, took the biggest hit. Globally, their ranks dropped 2.5 percent to 100,000 and their combined fortunes fell about 5 percent.

The ultrawealthy are more likely to invest their money in higher risk assets such as hedge funds, private equity or commercial real estate.

While returns can be greater, if markets turn sour such investments are also harder to unload for a 'palatable price in a viable time frame,' so instead they were stuck in super rich investors' portfolios, where they quickly lost value last year, the report said.
