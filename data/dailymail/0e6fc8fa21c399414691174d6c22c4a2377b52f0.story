It's every parent's worst nightmare - when Alison and Basil Eastwood waved their daughter off on a gap year adventure, the thought she would never return home was inconceivable.  

But the parents from Bicester, Oxfordshire, were bereft after Cecily, 19, was killed while she was volunteering in Zambia.

The teenager had been enjoying teaching at a school in Kitwe where she ran a homework club for orphans. She intended to stay there for a year before taking up a place at Cambridge University. 

Basil and Alison today, the couple have made a huge difference to the lives of thousands of children in Africa after setting up a charity in memory of their late daughter

Life cut short: Cecily had been enjoying a gap year in Zambia before taking a place at Cambridge University

But her life was cut short when a pick-up truck she had been travelling in crashed after its tyre burst due to striking a pothole.

Alison, Basil and their three other daughters, Philippa, Verity and Alice were devastated.

In search of closure, Alison and Basil felt compelled to visit the area where Cecily had spent her final days. 

Alison, 68, said: 'It was very hard going to visit Zambia. Everywhere we went there were reminders of Cecily. 

'The places we were going to were all places that Cecily had been. I even saw a woman in the market who was wearing one of Cecily's dresses because after Cecily passed away her clothes were distributed within the community.'

The trip ended up being more than just a chance to feel closer to their daughter after Alison, who used to work as a language teacher, and Basil, 70, a former British Ambassador, met the orphans Cecily had worked with. 

Alison realised that they too had felt loss and she knew she had to do something to help them - which would also allow her to honour Cecily's memory. 

She recalled: 'When we got there all the children that Cecily had been teaching met us and sang a welcoming African song, which was incredibly moving. There were hundreds of them. I realised that we had lost one child and all these children had lost parents. And that coming from a privileged society we were in a position to do something to help them.

'There is never any reason or meaning you can bring to a young death but being able to continue the work that Cecily started has been so important to us. Not only has it helped the children in Zambia it has helped me and Cecily’s sisters to be able to do something in her name. In some way it keeps her alive.'

Since setting up the charity in 1998, Basil, pictured with children in Zambia, and Alison have helped thousands

Money donated to Cecily's Fund, which is now supported by Comic Relief, helps students like these who would not otherwise get a good education in Zambia

There are 1.2 million orphaned children living in Zambia, almost half have lost at least one parent to HIV/AIDS. Without parental support, many go without a good education. But thanks to donations this Red Nose Day... 

The parents set up Cecily's Fund which supports thousands of six to eighteen-year-olds who have lost one or both of their parents to HIV, enabling them to access primary and secondary education in the Copperbelt region of Zambia. 

Since starting the charity in 1998, the year after Cecily's death, they have raised thousands of pounds that has made a difference to the lives of thousands of children.

Their supporters have run marathons, scaled mountains and walked for miles in order to secure sponsorship. 

Alison, who has taken on fundraising challenges herself along with her family, said: 'In the 16 years since our beloved Cecily died her Fund has paid over 82,000 primary school fees and 38,000 secondary school fees. 

'On average we have been supporting about 8,000 children in school each year. By enabling them to go to school Cecily’s Fund has given them a ladder to climb up out of the destitution to which they would otherwise have been condemned. That is something very special.'

Now the charity has joined forces with Comic Relief - which launched its latest appeal on Monday ahead of Red Nose Day on Friday 13th March.

With help from Comic Relief, the charity's main priority is to increase the attendance of orphaned children - and in particular girls - in schools and to ensure they receive a full course of primary education. 

A common obstacle for children in Zambia is the inability to afford essential school kit such as uniforms and textbooks. 

Cecily's Fund pays for these crucial items so children can then access education. 

Red Nose Day is back on Friday 13th March. Money raised this Red Nose Day will help to transform lives here in the UK and across Africa. Find out how you can help at www.rednoseday.com
