A teenage mother who went missing with her new-born baby has been found, police said.

Bedfordshire Police launched an appeal for help to find 16-year-old Jasmine Woodbridge and her son Jayden yesterday after she left Luton and Dunstable Hospital without telling anyone.

She gave birth at the hospital on April 30.

But just one day later the teenager took her newborn and departed the hospital without telling anyone.

After her disappearance, officers have warned that anyone harbouring the teenager and her child could be committing an offence as they could be seen to be falsifying or withholding information from police.
