Brendan Rodgers says he will not heap the pressure on Rickie Lambert after the new Liverpool striker failed to score his first goal for the club during pre-season.

The 32-year-old made the move from Southampton to Liverpool at the beginning of June for £4million, but couldn't get off the mark for his boyhood club in any of their friendlies.

But Liverpool manager Rodgers insists the England international will break his duck soon enough.

Rodgers told Sky Sports News: 'Don't put pressure on Rickie Lambert to get goals, Rickie Lambert has been brought in here to be a very valuable member of our squad.

'He has proven it all his career. He has got goals at whatever level he has played at.

'He came on for internationals and he gets goals, with Southampton for the past couple of seasons he gets goals.

'So there is no need for him to be under any pressure, he needs to come in at 32 years of age and contribute to the history of this club.

'He's a big supporter of this club, he is past that now, he is here to do a job. I trust him to do the job and he will do a great job for us.'

Lambert could have got going with a penalty against AC Milan in pre-season - having never missed from the spot for former club Southampton in 34 attempts - but failed to do so.

On the run: Lambert 'has been brought (to Liverpool) to be a very valuable member of our squad' says Rodgers
