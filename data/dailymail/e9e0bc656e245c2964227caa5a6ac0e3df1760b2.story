Gennady Golovkin, the fearsome Kazakh warrior who is surging up boxing’s pound-for-pound rankings via a succession of 19 successive knock-outs, has been guaranteed the super-fight against Miguel Cotto which he is not only craving but richly deserves.

The WBC have now ordered Cotto to take their world middleweight title into a championship unification battle with Golovkin within three months of a voluntary defence of that belt this spring, against an as-yet-unnamed opponent.

President Mauricio Sulaiman says: ‘We have instructed Miguel that he must fight Gennady, as his mandatory challenger, next after his April fight, assuming of course that he wins.’

Amir Khan has offered to meet Cotto in April or May but given the two-division disparity in poundage that would have to be at catch-weight and the Puerto Rican idol is obliged to defend his WBC belt.

Golovkin has been ducked by the other leading middleweights while cutting a swathe through the division, culminating in last Saturday night’s brutal KO in Monaco of our own Martin Murray, who had never been off his feet before those three knock-downs let alone stopped.

That took Golovkin to 29 knock-outs in his all-win record of 32 fights, the highest percentage in the history of the hallowed middleweight division.

Martin Murray was sent to the canvas three times by a rampant Golovkin but was stopped in the 11th round
