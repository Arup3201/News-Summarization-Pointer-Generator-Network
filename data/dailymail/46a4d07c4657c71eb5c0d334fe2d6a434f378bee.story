David Cameron is attending the the Northern Future Forum in Riga, Lativa, where he warned against banking reforms which could damage Britain's competitiveness

David Cameron and Boris Johnson joined forces yesterday to condemn ‘deluded’ plans for a Europe-wide cap on bankers’ bonuses.

In a rare show of unity, the Prime Minister and London Mayor each voiced grave concerns about proposals which critics claim could damage the City and force major banks to move abroad.

Downing Street said Mr Cameron had ‘real concerns’ about the plans.

Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable also criticised the proposals, warning they would ‘present problems for the UK’.

Under the EU proposal a perk of two years' salary could only be paid if a majority of shareholders agreed to it.

The deal must be signed off by EU governments before coming into force next year but Chancellor George Osborne is expected to argue against it at a meeting of European finance ministers next year.

Mr Cameron, meeting European leaders in the Latvian capital Riga, also cautioned that the cap should not be allowed to stifle Britain's role as a global banking centre.

Speaking during a press conference, the PM said: 'We have major international banks based in the UK that have branches and activities all over the world.

'We need to make sure that regulation put in place in Brussels is flexible enough to allow those banks to continue competing and succeeding while being located in the UK.

'We will look carefully at the outcome of the negotiations before working out the appropriate take at Ecofin next week.

'Britain
wants effective bank regulations. One of the failures of the last 
government was the failure of not having effective bank regulations. We 
will look carefully at the outcome of the negotiations.'

He said the UK should instead focus on the Vickers plan, which would separate risk-taking investment banks from retail or high street banks

'We must be able to implement the Vickers plan in the UK which in some ways is tougher than regulations that are being put in place in other European countries.'

Boris Johnson joined the chorus of British opposition, branding the plans 'deluded' and 'self-defeating'.

The London Mayor warned it would simply play into the hands of the City of London's overseas rivals, while undermining support for the EU in Britain.

'People will wonder why we stay in the EU if it persists in such transparently self-defeating policies,' he said.

'Brussels cannot control the global market for banking talent. Brussels cannot set pay for bankers around the world.

'The most this measure can hope to achieve is a boost for Zurich and Singapore and New York at the expense of a struggling EU.

This is possibly the most deluded measure to come from Europe since Diocletian tried to fix the price of groceries across the Roman Empire.'

Battle: Chancellor George Osborne opposes a cap like the one agreed by EU chiefs last night

Mr Osborne is expected to try to block the plans, claiming it would prevent City firms hiring the best staff, prompting an exodus of top talent to New York.

The deal must still be signed-off by EU governments before coming into force in 2014 but the UK is struggling to convince other countries it is a bad idea.

If Britain loses its showdown with Brussels, it would mean the most draconian clampdown on fat cats' perks since the financial crisis of 2008.

It came as the taxpayer-owned Royal Bank of Scotland announced losses of £5.16bn for last year, but it is still expected to pay its top five executives £6m in shares and an annual bonus on top of their six or seven figure ‘basic’ salaries.

RBS said it paid employees £607 million in bonuses for 2012, including £215 million for investment bankers, down from a total pot of £789 million in 2011.

The bank's chief executive, Stephen Hester, insisted that 'pay should be aligned with contribution', but denounced the plan to impose bonus rules which will apply only to the banking industry.

'I don't think bankers should be treated
as special creatures in any way,' he said. 'I think we should apply rules in the
same way to anyone.'

Under the proposed EU rules, payments to bankers would only be allowed to reach twice the annual fixed salary if a large majority of a bank's shareholders signed it off, said Othmar Karas, the European Parliament's chief negotiator today.

'This overhaul of EU banking rules will make sure that banks in the future have enough capital, both in terms of quality and quantity, to withstand shocks. This will ensure that taxpayers across Europe are protected into the future,' said Ireland's finance minister Michael Noonan, who led the negotiations for 27 governments.

The bonus cap was part of a sweeping financial reform package introducing higher capital requirements for banks, the so-called Basel III rules.

Last night's agreement - reached at during an eight-hour make-or-break negotiating session between EU politicians, the European Commission and representatives of the bloc's 27 governments in Brussels - ensures the package can take effect next year.

Top bankers and traders may currently earn bonuses multiple times their base salary based on their performance, given that there is no legal pay limit yet. But public outrage has grown across Europe over large bonus payments to executives of banks that received huge state bailouts during the financial crisis.

Proponents of the bonus cap say the payments encouraged bankers to take massive risks at the expense of the long-term future of their businesses, which helped to destabilise the financial system.

'For the first time in the history of EU financial market regulation, we will cap bankers' bonuses,' Mr Karas said.

'The essence is that from 2014, European banks will have to set aside more money to be more stable and concentrate on their core business, namely financing the real economy, that of small and medium-sized enterprises and jobs.'

Britain, home to Europe's biggest financial industry, had vehemently rejected the proposal, saying the rules would drive away talent and hamper growth.

London tried to rally other EU governments behind its position, but failed to garner enough support.

Most governments said they would accept the bonus cap to ensure the more important Basel III rules come into force by January 2014.

The Federation of European Employers (FedEE) immediately claimed that the agreement to curb bankers’ pay exceeded EU powers.

FedEE secretary-general Robin Chater, a former adviser to the European Commission, said: 'What EU negotiators have failed to appreciate is that such an action is beyond the powers vested in the European Union under the EU Treaty. Article 153 (5) of the treaty clearly states that EU legislative powers shall ‘not apply to pay’.

'Furthermore, even if the council’s powers were not challenged in this matter, financial institutions would remain free to increase base salaries to reward and retain key staff.

He went on: 'What politicians and bureaucrats have always ignored is that high remuneration levels in the financial sector - and especially substantial variable payments - serve to minimise fraud levels, retain talent, drive high performance and encourage continuity of employment. That is why corruption is so rife in many states where senior banking staff are badly paid.

'Many EU states have long coveted the City of London’s success as an international financial centre and regarded high bonus payments as its Achilles heel. This measure is therefore no more than an attempt to exploit the current vulnerability of the City by riding on the back of the collective jealousy of bankers’ pay in public opinion and the recent downgrading of the UK’s international credit rating.'

Disaster: The UK fears that the top talent working in the City will leave London for rivals like New York where bonuses would be higher

But Mr Karas said it was a bigger deal than just bank bonuses, including key measures long demanded to make loans to SMEs easier: “The new banking law is not only a piece of banking regulation, but a real economy financing act.'

The negotiations on the package have been dragging on for 10 months. After a meeting last week broke down without a compromise, the European Parliament - which has insisted on adding the banker bonus legislation to the wider Basel III package - gave the EU governments an ultimatum until yesterday's negotiating session.

Now the final approval by parliament and government leaders of the package is expected to be a formality, although it was not immediately clear what position Britain would take. But even if the UK would not back the package, the remaining EU members could still force the legislation through by adopting it by qualified majority.

The key part of the package is requiring all banks to gradually increase their capital over the coming years to stabilise the financial sector across the European Union's member states, which together form the world's largest economy.

The legislation is part of global efforts to prevent another shock to the financial system like that prompted by Lehman Brothers' 2008 collapse, when banks were highly leveraged while enjoying low capital requirements.

The lack of solid financial cushions meant that many banks were vulnerable, and eventually required taxpayer-funded bailouts to avoid bankruptcy.
