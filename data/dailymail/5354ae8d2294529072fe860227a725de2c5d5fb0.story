Unwell: Ted Robbins (pictured) collapsed clutching his chest during the opening night of a revival of Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights live show. He had been due to have a heart operation in three weeks

Phoenix Nights actor Ted Robbins has laughed off collapsing on stage, speaking from his hospital bed for the first time since suffering a heart attack during a live show. 

The 59-year-old comedian thanked well-wishers for their kind messages, joking the health scare on Saturday was designed to 'upstage' his co-stars. 

'It was all an attempt by Den Perry to upstage Potters big night!' said Mr Robbins.

'I'm overwhelmed by the love and kind messages from everyone. Love to everyone, see you soon,' he added. 

It comes as the actor's sister revealed he was due to undergo 'routine' heart surgery in just a few weeks before the incident over the weekend.  

Singer and comedienne Kate Robbins said her brother, who plays Den Perry in Peter Kay's comedy, had been left with a 'dodgy' heart valve after suffering rheumatic fever as a child.

Mr Robbins was in the middle of a solo section when he stumbled to the ground - prompting the curtain to be closed immediately and the show to be cancelled at the Manchester Arena.

A doctor ran on stage from the audience and saved his life.

Initially, audience members thought the collapse was part of the show - before it emerged he was gravely ill. 

His sister said: 'He's doing great. He did have a cardiac arrest. Thanks to the really quick thinking of a doctor and a paramedic in the audience, he received a life-saving procedure.

'Ted has rheumatic fever as a child, which affected a heart valve - so we knew there was a problem. He was due to have a routine heart operation in the next three weeks.

'People think he's a big guy so he must have had a heart attack. It not as simple as that. He's always had a dodgy valve.

'He's actually been quite a fit man most of his life. This has just been an horrendous thing for us all.'

He was rushed to Wythenshawe Hospital after collapsing on stage on the opening night of Phoenix Nights Live at the Manchester Arena on Saturday. 

He remains in a stable condition at Wythenshawe Hospital - and is said to be in good spirits.

Kate Robbins added: 'We were all hysterically laughing and jumping up and down when he came on in the second half - his daughter Molly, his wife and his son Jack.

'Then he just dropped like a stone and we just said "that's not in the act". We ran and had to barge past, but security wouldn't let us on stage.

'Thank God there was a heart surgeon in the audience and a paramedic who just got there and saved his life. It was a surreal nightmare. But luckily he's doing great.'

Despite the terrifying on-stage collapse, Ted is said to be smiling from his hospital bed and he even had a joke for his family as they rushed to his side on Saturday night.

Kate said: 'We walked in and he had his oxygen mask on. He just quietly went "ta-da". You can't take away his humour, even in that situation.

'What's been overwhelming has been the thousands and thousands of good wishes from everyone. 

'There has been so many comedians saying such great things about him.

'Ted is known as "the comedian's comedian". He's known for his wit - but more so probably for his caring of other human beings.'

Comedian Peter Kay led a standing ovation in support of Mr Robbins as Phoenix Nights returned to the stage at Manchester Arena on Sunday night.

Before the show, the Bolton star wrote on his Facebook page: 'My thoughts, prayers and love to Ted, Judy and all of the family. So happy that Ted is in right place and getting the care he needs.

'Thanks to the audience, cast and crew for being so understanding last night xxxx.'
