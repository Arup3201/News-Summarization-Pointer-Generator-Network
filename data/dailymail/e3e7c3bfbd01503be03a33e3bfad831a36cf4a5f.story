A man has been banned from keeping dogs after he left two Staffordshire bull terriers to rot under a mound of clothing and household items for a year.

David Rymell, 33, 'could not face' going into his home after his 15-year-old dog Bud passed away and instead abandoned the carcass and his other dog.

He left a decaying Bud in the lounge and shut Weiser, seven, in the kitchen before leaving the home, only returning to collect post.

Rymell was banned from keeping dogs for 15 years when he was sentenced at South Tyneside Magistrates Court

The bodies of Rymell's two dogs, Bud and Weiser, were found decomposing in his South Shields home

After eight days Weiser was also found dead.

The dogs were only discovered when bailiffs forced their way into the home more than a year later when Rymell, from South Shields, stopped paying rent.

Shocked RSPCA officers described the decaying conditions as the worst case they had seen.

Rymell, who pleaded guilty to two counts of failing to meet the needs of an animal, was banned from keeping dogs for 15 years.

South Tyneside Magistrates’ Court heard RSPCA officers were called after the horrified bailiffs found the dogs’ decomposed carcasses hidden under a pile of clothing and cushions.

The scaffolder told police he was so shocked at the death of Bud he could not put himself through going into the house every day.

Vets said they could not determine a cause of death for either dog.

Denise Jackman, prosecuting, told the court the offences took place between January 2012 and June 2013.

The second dog was abandoned after the first dog died and Rymell could not face burying him

Defence lawyer Paul Kennedy told magistrates this was a case of 'short-term neglect' and said Rymell, of Jarrow, Tyne and Wear, showed 'genuine remorse'.

'After the deaths he could not face going into the house, which was being renovated at the time,' Mr Kennedy said.

'The dogs were his life. He does not have children but his dogs were effectively his children.

'He loved for them, cared for them and fed them. He has indicated to me that he is not interested in getting another dog because he will never be able to replace the ones he had.'

Speaking after the case, RSPCA inspector Catherine Richardson said: 'It’s a great result for us, in particular the disqualification.

'It means we don’t have to worry about another dog going through the same thing.

'I’ve been an inspector for two years and this is the worst case I’ve seen. It’s a shame that by the time we found out about it both dogs were already dead.'

Rymell was given a 12-month community order with a 200-hour unpaid work requirement, and was fined £260.
