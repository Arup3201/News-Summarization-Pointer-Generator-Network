Ronny Deila has branded Dundee United’s Aidan Connolly a diver - then called on the SFA to prove they don’t just punish Celtic players for simulation.

Connolly tumbled to win United’s goal from the penalty spot - scored by Nadir Ciftci - towards the end of the first half after ref Craig Thomson deemed he had been tripped by Anthony Stokes.

In August, Celtic winger Derk Boerrigter was handed a two-match ban for diving to win a penalty in a 2-0 win at St Johnstone. And Deila insisted he was baffled as to why it’s only his team that is targeted – albeit he was seemingly unaware St Johnstone’s Brian Graham was also suspended for diving to win a penalty against Inverness in December.

‘The United penalty was a dive and hopefully it will be the same rules for everybody,’ fumed Deila. ‘We are the only team this season in the league to have a suspension for diving, Derk Boerrigter.

‘I said at the time it was no problem because that is the line that will be taken by everyone. But I don’t think anybody has had it since then. The Scottish players have been unbelievably good. They’ve not dived but if they do (like Connolly) it should be the same rules.

‘Is it the fault of the ref or the player they got a penalty? It’s both. But I accept people make mistakes. We have a rule where people look at things afterwards but I don’t see anybody else getting suspensions.’

Deila will study footage of the melee that saw Virgil van Dijk ordered off alongside Paul Paton before deciding whether to appeal in a bid to clear him for Sunday’s League Cup final against United at Hampden. 

But Stefan Johansen will miss the Scottish Cup quarter-final replay at Parkhead on March 18 after being booked yesterday.

‘I have looked at some pictures but it’s hard to see what happened,’ said Deila. ‘Virgil just said there was a tackle and suddenly somebody was holding his legs. There was some kicking of each other to get off each other. It was nothing. 

'Hopefully everybody can play in the next game. Will we appeal? We will see. I actually didn’t know until now that Stefan is out of the replay. It’s good we have a big squad.’ 

Leigh Griffiths missed his chance to equalise for Celtic from the penalty spot

Deila didn’t fear any further disciplinary problems in the final but took a swipe at the abysmal Tannadice pitch.

‘There is going to be a high temperature, yes, but I’m not worried. It is fantastic. That’s why we love football. We are fighting for big things, trophies, and we have to keep our discipline. But the pitch made it a fight today. It was nothing about playing football. If you are going to develop players in this league, you have to have pitches you can play on.’

Meanwhile, the SFA compliance officer could be forced to look at footage from Dutch TV in which Celtic’s John Guidetti is alleged to have performed a song during an interview including the words ‘the huns are deid’. 

A recent petition lobbying the Scottish Parliament was launched by a group of Rangers fans who claimed ‘huns’ is a derogatory term used against Protestants.
