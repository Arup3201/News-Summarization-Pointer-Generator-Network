France's culture minister has provoked a cry of disbelief after admitting that she hasn't read a single book over the past two years.

To add to her embarrassment, Fleur Pellerin was also unable to say on a TV show which book by France's new Nobel Literature Prize winner Patrick Modiano was her favourite, just minutes after having said she had lunched with the author.

Only two weeks ago, she had hailed Modiano as representing the 'influence and vitality of French literature in the eyes of the world.'

'I admit without any problem that I have had no time to read over the past two years,' she went on to say, referring to her time in government first as minister for innovation and the digital economy and now as culture minister.

'I read a lot of notes, I read a lot of legislative documents, I read a lot of news, AFP (news agency) stories... But I read very little.' 

Her admission sent Twitter ablaze, with many shocked by the fact that a culture minister had not read books for two years and did not know any of Modiano's books.

'Long live our brilliant government and especially culture,' said one Twitter user with the handle @MathieuLecerf.

Honoured: Patrick Modiano was named the 111th winner of the Nobel prize for literature earlier this month

But others leapt to her defence or ridiculed the controversy.

'The worst thing is that if Fleur Pellerin had said she spent her evenings reading, many would have blamed her for not working enough,' said @intwittoveritas.

'France is finally facing up to its main problem in this period of deep crisis: Fleur Pellerin has not read Modiano,' joked @HenriRouquier.

Modiano, 69, was named the 111th winner of the Nobel Prize for literature earlier this month, taking home the £700,000 award.

He is perhaps best known for his 1978 novel Missing Person, for which he won the prestigious Prix Goncourt French literature prize.

Pellerin, 41, was born in South Korea but adopted by a French family at six months old after being abandoned on the streets of Seoul.

She took over the post of culture minister from Aurélie Filippetti in August and is seen as more progressive on issues such as technology.
