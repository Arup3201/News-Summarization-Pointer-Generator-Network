A gardener has broken the record for growing the world’s biggest gooseberry - four years after losing the crown to a rival green-fingered pensioner.

Kelvin Archer, 53, has produced the fruit which weighs 64.49g - around the size of a large egg.

It is the first gooseberry ever to weigh more than 40 pennyweights - an ancient system used to measure the popular summer treat.

Kelvin’s whopping gooseberry outweighed the previous record-breaking fruit - grown by pensioner Bryan Nellist, 76, in 2009 - by over two grams.

Mr Nellist, from Whitby, North Yorks., beat Kelvin after a bitter row over weighing methods which vary between regions.

Guinness World Records eventually ruled in Mr Nellist’s favour but this week Kelvin reclaimed the crown with his prized fruit.

Kelvin, resident gardener at elegant Rode Hall in Scholar Green, Cheshire, grows 30 types of gooseberries on 100 different trees in between his official duties at the stately home.

He feeds his gooseberry bushes with a secret nutrient recipe and monitors their progress round-the-clock from his cottage in the grounds.

Speaking today, Kelvin, a professional gardener of 31 years, said he was thrilled to net the new record.

Married Kelvin, who has three grown-up daughters, added: 'I’m absolutely delighted to reclaim the record.

'I had to have witnesses there as well as the secretary of Mid-Cheshire Gooseberry Association.

'I didn’t know if it would set the record until it was picked and weighed, I couldn’t believe it when I found out the weight.

'Everyone was really pleased for me and delighted that I’ve brought the record back to Cheshire, since it’s been in Yorkshire for a few years.

'The nicest thing was the previous record holder, Bryan Nellist, rang me the next day to congratulate me.

'I’ve been doing this for years, it’s my hobby. I came from a village called Marton in Cheshire where everyone grew and shared gooseberries, so it went from there.

'My dad and neighbours grew them, and we entered competitions - it’s become a bit of an obsession.

'I take most of the gooseberries off the trees, that helps the others to grow bigger.

'With the bad weather, last year was hopeless, and there was only one grown weighing over 30 pennyweights. This year is much better.'

Kevin Staton, 54, secretary of Mid-Cheshire Gooseberry Association said he knew the gooseberry would be a record breaker when he saw it dangling on the branch.

He said: 'I was really pleased for Kelvin. He’s worked hard over the years with his gooseberries and deserves to reclaim the record.

'I’m sure other Cheshire gooseberry growers will be delighted for him, and hopefully it will attract new members.

'The record gooseberry was absolutely huge, it was the size of a large duck egg or a kiwi. His is the first gooseberry over 40 pennyweights, a fantastic achievement.'

Kelvin’s gooseberry, measured according to Cheshire’s rules, weighed 41 pennyweights and 11 and a quarter grains.

Mr Nellist previously held the record with a 39 pennyweight (62.01 g) fruit grown in his back garden.

A row broke out due to a difference in the weighing systems used by North-West and Yorkshire growers when the pensioner submitted his world record claim in 2009.

Guinness adjudicators eventually found in Mr Nellist’s favour after working out the weight of his fruit in grams.

Gooseberry growers in the North West record their weight in pennyweights and grains, with a pennyweight equalling 1.55g. Growers across the Pennines changed to a system of drams and grains, with a dram equalling 1.77g.

Pennyweights and grains have been used to measure goosberries for around 250 years.

Rivalry between the pair dates back 20 years when Kelvin first claimed the world record in 1993.

Mr Nellist beat his fruit in 2009 until Kelvin’s latest gooseberry broke the world record again this year.

Kelvin said: 'Gooseberries take a lot of nurturing, you have to feed them a lot of manure, you must cover them from the rain and prune others to let the bigger ones thrive.

'Myself and Mr Nellist have enjoyed a friendly rivalry for years and no doubt he’ll be back in his garden planning how to beat me with next year’s crop.'
