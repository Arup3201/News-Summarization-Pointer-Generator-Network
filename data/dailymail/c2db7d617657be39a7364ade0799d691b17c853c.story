In a move to boost sales and promote a healthier image, beverage giant Coca-Cola Amatil has launched a new 250ml slimline can for Australian consumers on the run.

In what Coca Cola says is its biggest product launch since Coke Zero, the 'perfectly small' cans will cost no more than $2 and will be sold at convenience stores and petrol outlets Australia-wide.

The company believes the availability of smaller cans of its Coca-Cola, Sprite and Fanta drinks will increase sales by appealing to consumers watching their hip-pockets and their waistlines.

Coca-Cola says its multimillion dollar 'perfectly small can' campaign is its biggest since the launch of Coke Zero

'We've listened to what consumers want and we're getting serious about smaller portion sizes,' a Coca-Cola Spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'This is really about providing consumers with more choice and the point of difference is that you'll be able to buy these  small cans from more convenient outlets, giving people the option to grab a taste of their favourite drink on the run.'

Coca Cola says the smaller cans are one part of the company's commitment to a 'healthier Australia'.

'Last year we launched a series of commitments across our food and beverage products to help address the problem of obesity in Australia and portion sizes was certainly a part of that plan,' said a spokesperson for the company.'

Changes also include offering a wider selection of low-kilojoule beverage options and providing transparent nutritional information in more places, including vending machines. 

'We believe Coca-Cola has an important role in providing more beverage choices, including more choice in serve sizes and low-kilojoule options, clearly communicating the kilojoule content of our products and supporting community-based physical activity programs,' said Phil Roberts, Commercial and Franchise Director of Coca-Cola South Pacific last year.

Coca-Cola Amatil is Australia's largest beverage company, with 60 per cent of the soft drink market. But last year, the company posted a 16 per cent fall in profits as consumers moved away from sugary fizzies towards healthier options like juices and coconut water.

Coca-Cola, who are launching a multimillion dollar 'small' marketing campaign say the new 250ml cans have been popular in other markets.

'People still love Coke, it's been around for 128 years and there's nothing that will replace it,' said a Spokesperson for the company.

Coca-Cola already sells 200ml 'mini-cans' in multi-packs in supermarkets for about $1.09 a can. The average price of a regular can of coke is about $3.

Jeff Rogut from the Australasian Association of Convenience Stores says the new 250ml cans may help smaller retailers compete by being able to offer a cheaper, more convenient product but he doesn't believe they will 'revolutionize' sales.

'The product is the same. The price may change and the value equation may change but consumers are interested in having something really new and different," he told Fairfax. 'How many ways can you package Coca-Cola?.'
