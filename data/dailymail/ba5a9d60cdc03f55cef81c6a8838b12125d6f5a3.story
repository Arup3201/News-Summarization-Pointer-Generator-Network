London now boasts three of the 10 most visited museums in the world, including the British Museum, National Gallery and the Tate Modern.

The results place the capital on an equal footing with Paris which also has three museums - the Louvre, The Centre Pompidou and the Musée d’Orsay - in the top 10.

It comes after the British Museum reclaimed its title as the second most popular cultural institution after a two-year absence by overtaking New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art.

With more than 6.7 million visitors last year, the British museum saw a 20 per cent rise on 2012. 

Second most popular: The British Museum has reclaimed its place as the second most visited museum in the world with 6.7 million attendees in 2013

Growing popularity: The British Museum is currently displayed the Saxon treasures of Sutton Hoo. A curator is pictured with a Sutton Hoo tin helmet

On display: A 37-metre long-ship is part of the Viking Exhibition at the British Museum

Still number one: The Louvre in Paris has been the most visited museum in the world for six years running. Last year alone it had 9.3 million visitors

It now comes just behind the Louvre in Paris, which attracts 9.3 million attendees every year, making it the most popular museum in the world. It has claimed the top spot for attendance figures for six years in a row.

The Metropolitan Museum of Art has now dropped back down into third place, despite visitor numbers rising to 6.2 million.

The top 10 museum list, which was compiled by The Art Newspaper, also placed the National Gallery as the fourth most popular with just over 6 million visitors - up from 5.1 million in 2012 - despite not having any huge exhibitions.

1) LOUVRE, Paris, with 9,334,435 visitors

2) BRITISH MUSEUM, London, with 6,701,036

3) METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART, New York, with 6,226,727

4) NATIONAL GALLERY, London, with 6,031,574

5) VATICAN MUSEUMS, Vatican City, with 5,459,000

6) TATE MODERN, in London, with 4,884,939

7) NATIONAL PALACE MUSEUM, Taipei, with 4,500,278

8) NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART, in Washington DC, with 4,093,070

9) CENTRE POMPIDOU, Paris, with 3,745,000

10) MUSEE D'ORSAY, Paris, with 3,500,000

But the Tate Modern saw a drop in visitors with just 4.8 million visitors in 2013 compared to 5.3 million in 2012, although it still managed to come sixth in the list.

The Art Newspaper suggests the decline is possibly down to the closure of the Tanks to allow its extension to be completed and the end of the Unilever series in the Turbine Hall.

Meanwhile, deputy editor Javier Pes put the British Museum's increased popularity down to its exhibitions - particularly the Life And Death In Pompeii And Herculaneum show.

It is currently hosting a Viking exhibition complete with 37-metre longship and has placed the Saxon treasures of Sutton Hoo on centre stage in its newly refurbished medieval gallery.

Others to feature in the list include the Vatican Museums in fifth place, the National Palace Museum in Taipei in seventh, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC in eighth place.

Two other museums in Paris took the final spots - the Centre Pompidou came in ninth place and the Musée d’Orsay in 10.

The Museum of Modern Art in New York just missed out on a place in the top 10 after its admission just topped the three million mark.

Meanwhile The Detroit Institute of Arts just missed a spot in the top 100 museums in 102nd place with 594,267 visitors, up from 429,000 in 2011.

In third place: The Metropolitan Museum Of Art in New York saw its visitor numbers increase to 6.2 million but it was still knocked off the second spot to become the third most popular museum in the world

In the top 10: The National Gallery in Trafalgar Square, Central London, came in fourth place with just over 6 million visitors in 2013
