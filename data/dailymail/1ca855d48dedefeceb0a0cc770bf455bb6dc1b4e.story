A comet-chasing probe is set to be woken from its deep space slumber early next year, the European Space Agency (ESA) has said.

At precisely 10 am GMT on 20 January, the Rosetta spacecraft be brought back to life as it moves closer towards Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenk.

When Europe's Rosetta spacecraft wakes, scientists are hoping it will be ready for the final stage of its daring mission to land on the comet.

When Europe's Rosetta probe gets roused from its deep space slumber next month, scientists are hoping it will wake up fit and ready for the final stage of its daring mission to land a spacecraft on a comet

The scientists are in for an nerve-wracking wait as there is little room for mistakes as the coming months.

After it is woken from its slumber, the spacecraft will be involved a high-speed chase followed by a delicate dance around comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

It will then attempt a historic landing in November 2014 the intercepting a 4km wide comet as it hurtles towards the sun.

‘Imagine trying to parachute onto the tip of a mountain,’ said Paolo Ferri, head of mission operations at the European Space Agency (ESA).

The effort is different from Nasa’s Deep Impact probe that fired a projectile into comet Tempel in 2005, hurling a plume of matter into space for scientists to study.

For the coldest, loneliest leg of the mission, as Rosetta travelled out towards the orbit of Jupiter, the spacecraft was put into deep-space hibernation

Rosetta was launched in 2004 and has since travelled around the sun five times, picking up energy from Earth and Mars to line it up with its final destination: Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. 

For the coldest, loneliest leg of the mission, as Rosetta travelled out towards the orbit of Jupiter, the spacecraft was put into deep-space hibernation.

In 2014, Rosetta will complete its cruise towards the comet, meeting with it in August, before putting its Philae lander onto the comet’s surface in November.

The time for Rosetta to wake up and prepare for this most exciting scientific adventure is now fast approaching.

That mission was more of a sniper shot compared to the extended meeting ESA is planning for its spacecraft.

Launched in 2004, Rosetta has already spent almost 10 years in space preparing for its big day.

The probe had to conduct three fly-bys of Earth and one of Mars, taking advantage of the planets' gravity to accelerate sufficiently to intercept comet 67P as it orbits the sun at speeds of up to 100,000 kph (62,000 mph).

The spacecraft has been in hibernation for more than two years now to conserve energy.

ESA has been using the time to solve two glitches that could jeopardise the mission: a problem with two of the four `reaction wheels' used to turn the spacecraft, and a small leak of helium that could affect the thrusters which are vital for its final manoeuvres.

‘This is making our life more difficult,’ Dr Ferri acknowledges. But he added that engineers have found workarounds.

If all goes according to plan, the probe's instruments will slowly switch themselves back on, though scientists will have a tense few hours of waiting before they can be sure the spacecraft is in full working order.

The following months will involve a gradual approach of 67P, as Rosetta gently slows down and eventually draws up alongside the comet in what Dr Ferri likened to two planes flying in formation.

This will give the mission team time to take plenty of pictures of the comet, which is about 4km (2.5 miles) in diameter, and identify a good landing site.

At the moment scientists are divided over whether to pick a site close to the comet's three active regions - where matter appears to be released into space - or to stay away from them to prevent dust from harming the lander's sensitive instruments.

The lander - called Philae - will drop onto the surface of 67P and latch on using a harpoon, to prevent it from drifting off into space due to the comet's weak gravity. Using drills, it will dig up samples and analyse them using on-board instruments.

Researchers hope to gain fascinating insights from the results, because comets have remained largely unchanged since the beginning of the universe.

‘This time capsule's been locked away for 4.6 billion years,’ said ESA's director of science Mark McCaughrean.

One key question scientists hope the mission can help answer is whether comets are responsible for the water on Earth, he said.
