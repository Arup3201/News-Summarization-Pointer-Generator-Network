It's a subject many women are reluctant to discuss, but hair thinning and balding can be as much a problem for them as for men.

Now a range of products has been launched to repair the effects of hair loss and nourish the tresses of those who wish to get their healthy look back.

The three-treatment Hairgen range – which includes a shampoo, a spray and a supplement – works by limiting the effect of dihydrotesterone, the hormone responsible for hair loss which is found in hair follicles.

Hair thinning can start when a woman reaches her 20s. Factors such as stress, pregnancy, menopause, ageing and even excessive use of straighteners can all contribute to the condition.

Demand for the Hairgen range, which costs £69.99, has been high, with a 6,000-strong waiting list on the Boots website.

After its launch in June the treatment initially sold out within three days.

The products contain extracts of an American plant – saw palmetto – as well as amino acids and biotin, a vitamin which encourages growth.

The drug-free range includes a shampoo, a spray and a supplement to combat thinning of hair without any of the side effects which are associated with other treatments.

The products contain extracts of the American plant Saw Palmetto, as well as Aminoacids and Biotin, a B-complex vitamin which encourages growth.

Anna Britton, Managing Director of Concept Healthcare, the company behind Hairgen, said: ‘Our three-step system contains topical treatments and nourishing capsules that have been developed to slow down the production of the major hormone Dihydrotestosterone  associated with hair loss, effectively protecting and stimulating the follicles and keeping them in optimum health.

Widespread problem: Factors such as stress, pregnancy and ageing can all contribute to baldness

‘It’s usually men we associate with baldness and thinning but a huge number of women are affected and it can have a big psychological impact.  To suddenly start losing your hair can be devastating to a woman’s self-esteem.’

Hairgen, which has been dermatologically tested, has proved popular with those who have used the treatment.

Sarah Lewis, 52, from Somerset said: ‘I have been menopausal for the last two years and some of the symptoms alongside hot flushes, included thinning hair which I’ve found distressing and embarrassing.  

‘I have been using the Hairgen system for just under a month as part of a trial and already my hair is thicker, stronger and it’s certainly stopped the hair loss.

‘I would recommend it to anyone including friends who haven’t got symptoms as it really leaves the hair feeling and looking healthy.’

Ben Marks, 44, from London said: ‘Have been trialling Hairgen for just three weeks and it’s stopped my hair thinning and my girlfriend thinks it looks thicker.   

‘It’s a major relief as I thought I’d end up shaving my hair off.’
