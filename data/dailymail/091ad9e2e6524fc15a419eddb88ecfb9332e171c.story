In his latest venture, a serial conman has told young women he could get them weather presenting roles on Channel Nine.

Brenton Robert Jarrett, 42, has a long history of pulling similar stunts, and on Monday he pleaded guilty to breaching his bail conditions in an Albury court.

It is said his new scam targeted young models aged 17 to 25, and he admitted he had failed to comply with his bail obligations.

Jarrett was awaiting a mental health evaluation before he could be sentenced on other charges he also plead guilty to in March.

Brenton Robert Jarrett has a history of scams, and has most recently been found to have been contacting young models telling them he could land them weathergirl jobs

The conman, from Howlong NSW, has previously claimed to be the brother and manager of Hollywood star Johnny Depp, actor Skeet Ulrich, and director Alfred Hitchcock's grandson.

This time, Jarrett set up a company called DM Productions and said he was part owner in the Nine Network under the fake name of Robert Caine.

On the company's website he used images from US photographers to try and prove his credibility.

According to The Border Mail, Jarrett advised Albury police on May 10 of his new contact details at DM Productions.

Just four days later, officers at Albury were contacted by a concerned member of the modelling industry reporting a man by the name of Robert Caine.

'Caine' had been contacting models over social media and trying to arrange meetings with the women.

The industry worker recognised Jarrett from previous exploits, but when confronted the conman said he was 'Jarrett's twin brother', according to ninemsn.

He also said 'his brother' committed suicide after he received media attention for previous crimes.

Jarrett suffers from bipolar disorder, and his sentencing was adjourned until July 22.

Previously, Jarrett told young women he owned a modelling agency - claiming to be Josh Kells from modelling agency Vexus.

In March he pleaded guilty to nine counts of obtaining financial advantage by deception and one count of failing to comply with reporting obligations.
