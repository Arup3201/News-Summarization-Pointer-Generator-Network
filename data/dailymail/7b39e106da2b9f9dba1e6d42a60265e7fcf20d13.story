Do you have £600,000 to spare? Then you might want to snap up the first-ever complete dinosaur skeleton to go on sale in the UK.

Hollywood stars are hoped to be among the bidders for the 17 metre Diplodocus next month, which looks like a prop straight from the Jurassic Park film set.

Named 'Misty', its fossils were discovered by the children of celebrated dinosaur hunter Raimund Albersdoerfer near to the famous Dana quarry in Wyoming, USA.

A huge dinosaur skeleton found in the United States in 2009 is being auctioned in Britain. Summers Place Auctions said the female Diplodocus longus skeleton, nicknamed Misty, measures 55 feet long and 19 feet tall

The female dinosaur was painstakingly prepared at a leading fossil laboratory in Holland before taking a day to be assembled at the auctioneers, 150 million years after walking the earth.

Relatively complete Diplodocus skeletons are extremely rare and this specimen joins only a handful of other known examples.

Even the famous Diplodocus ‘Dippy’ in the Natural History Museum, London, is a plaster copy taken from an original in the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

The skeleton was found mostly intact near a quarry in Wyoming by accident, and the skeleton was treated at a fossil laboratory in Holland before being assembled in Britain

The Diplodocus was a herbivore dinosaur that lived during the Late Jurassic period.

It is the longest of all 
dinosaurs with an unusual body structure that includes two rows of bones on the 
underside of its tail to provide extra support and greater movement.

Paleontologists believe that the ribs of the Diplodocus were not attached to the backbone, but instead were attached to the skin in the belly area.

It used to be thought that the sauropods, like Diplodocus, had a second brain. Paleontologists now think that what they thought was a second brain was just an enlargement in the spinal cord in the hip area.

Diplodocus longus is the longest of all dinosaurs with an unusual body structure that includes two rows of bones on the underside of its tail to provide extra support and greater movement.

Natural history expert Errol Fuller, who is overseeing the sale said: ‘There are quite a lot of emerging museums in the Far East, particularly in China, who may be interested.

‘I think there might be some private buyers who may wish to put in a bid. A couple of Hollywood stars have bought dinosaurs in the past.’

 ‘It would be a wonderful thing if you were a real rich person who could build a big outhouse for it,’ added Mr Fuller.

‘I think it's much better than a collector's car worth millions - and much cheaper. It's far better to show something this rare to your friends at dinner parties.’

The skeleton is now set to sell for an estimated price of £400,000 to £600,000 at Summers Place Auctions in Billingshurst, West Sussex, on November 27

The auction, named ‘Evolution’, is due to take place on sale by Summers Place Auctions, of Billingshurst, West Sussex, on November 27.

Alongside the Diplodocus longus, will be the sale of the only example of a highly important dodo pelvis bone in private hands.

This specimen was found in the Mare aux Songes, Mauritius during the 1860s when excavations were carried out by a local schoolmaster named George Clarke.

The auction also contains rare taxidermy specimens, including a Tarpan (an extinct variety of horse shown on the left) and a giant Aldabran tortoise (right)

There is also an opportunity to buy some rare Chrysanthemum Stones, which are formed of celastite crystal discovered during the building of a dam in China. It is thought that no more of this stone can be uncovered.

Another highlight is a giant blue semiprecious stone freeform from Afghanistan, which is 54 cm high and weighs 42 kg. The coloured stone is estimated to sell at £8,000-£10,000.
