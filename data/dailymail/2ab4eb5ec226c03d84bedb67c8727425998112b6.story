A wasp may have set off a chain of unfortunate events that left a Coca Cola truck smashed up, several bus passengers injured and a beloved seafood store in Florida in shambles.

A surveillance video has been released this week by the Jacksonville Transit Authority showing the moment on July 23 when a big red tractor trailer sideswept a city bus before plowing into a New Town fish market, which later had to be razed to the ground.

The driver of the vehicle, Calvin Hollis, 45, told investigators that a wasp flew into his cab as he was driving down West Beaver Street in New Town, causing him to lose control and crash.

At around 5pm on July 23, an unsuspecting driver with the Jacksonville Transporting Authority stopped the bus to let people off next to Discount Seafood store when the Coca Cola truck swerved from the left lane and struck the right side of the bus.

The out-of-control rig then careened west and slammed into Discount Seafood, sending debris flying everywhere.

Three bus passengers and two people inside the business were hospitalized with minor injuries.

The store was so badly damaged by the impact that it had to be demolished the following day because it was deemed unsafe.

Residents in the area lamented the destruction of the 70-year-old market, which was described as a New Town landmark renowned for the freshness of its products.

The hapless Coca Cola driver walked away from the accident unharmed and was cited for careless driving, adding to his six previous citations - two of them linked to crashes.
