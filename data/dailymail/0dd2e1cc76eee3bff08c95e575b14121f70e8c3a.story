The parents of an eight-year-old girl who suffered brain damage caused by staff failures during her delivery have won a multimillion pound payout.

Ruby Curtis suffers from cerebral palsy after she was starved of oxygen during her birth in 2005 when staff at St James Hospital in Leeds failed to recognise complications.

After an eight-year battle, her parents Lisa, 40, and Steve, 41, have been awarded a £2.95million lump sum to help cover the cost of her care. They will also receive annual payments taking the total figure to around £6.6million.

A High Court judge approved the sum on Friday which will fund her specialist school and provide care and equipment, case management, therapy and support to help her live an independent life. 

Payout: Lisa, 40, and Steve Curtis, 41, will receive £6.6m to help pay for their daughter Ruby's care after she was starved of oxygen during her birth at St James Hospital in Leeds

Mrs Curtis was admitted to St James Hospital on 28 August, 2005, when staff gave her a drug to bring on contractions.

Staff, who failed to recognise that her uterus had ruptured, were slow to act to deliver Ruby and she was starved of oxygen, causing the irreparable brain damage. Ruby now has athetoid cerebral palsy, affecting all four limbs, head and trunk, with fluctuating muscle tone and some involuntary movements.

This affects the execution of her motor skills, therefore she requires help with all aspects of daily living including personal care, feeding, play, and education.

Ruby can make vocal sounds but has no clear speech and all of these issues are permanent effects of the birth trauma.

Victim: Ruby Curtis suffered irreparable brain damage during her birth and now suffers from athetoid cerebral palsy which affects all her limbs

Mr Curtis, speaking out after winning 
the settlement, said: 'She joined the Percy Hedley School, which 
specialises in working with children with cerebral palsy, last year and
we are really pleased with the holistic approach they take to therapy 
and education.

'It is so much better for Ruby than the mainstream school in Leeds that Ruby previously attended and it is fantastic to see her thrive in her new school.

'Her confidence and self-esteem have improved significantly and working with her specialist one-on-one support is allowing her to flourish in education terms as well.

'The settlement awarded today means Ruby can now continue to attend this fabulous school as it well help fund her fees, accommodation in Newcastle and one-on-one support.

'Ruby's condition affects every aspect of her life and she needs round the clock assistance to meet her needs.

'The settlement approved today gives us peace of mind that she will have the funds to pay for the care, support, therapy and specialist equipment and technology that she needs to maximise her independence and help her reach her full potential for the rest of her life.'

Ruby drives an electric-powered wheelchair which has pink bodywork, a personalised number plate and is decorated with pictures of her favourite band, One Direction.

Mrs Curtis, who gave up work to care for her daughter, said: 'Ruby is a fantastic little girl and we are so proud of her, she is such an inspiration to us both. I felt angry initially but I don't feel that now, because I love her how she is.

'While it's heart-breaking to see her unable to do so many of the things the majority of other children take for granted, we couldn't have asked for a more perfect daughter.

Funds for the future: The Curtis family have been awarded a £2.95million lump sum as well as annual payments which takes the total to £6.6million to help pay for Ruby's future care

'We want Ruby to experience as much 
as she can in life and we help her as best we can. While it is tragic 
to think that all of this came as a result of mistakes made in her 
delivery that were avoidable, our focus is on making sure Ruby has the 
best life possible.

'Ruby
loves the same things as most other eight year old girls such as One 
Direction, Disney Princesses and shopping and she likes to get involved 
in as many activities as possible. She enjoys playing powerchair 
football, going swimming and to the cinema and she has recently joined 
Brownies near her school in Newcastle.'

The money, which will help give Ruby the best quality of life possible, will be managed by Irwin Mitchell's in-house Court of Protection team.

Rachelle Mahapatra, a Partner and medical law expert at Irwin Mitchell's Leeds office representing the family, said: 'The challenge in Ruby's case was ensuring that we are able to provide her with as much independence as possible in her life.

Proud parents: Lisa and Steve Curtis said their daughter Ruby is an inspiration to them both and they couldn't have asked for a more perfect little girl

'This includes having full-time professional carers so that Mum and Dad can be just that, and so that one day she can go to university and live as full a life as possible. The Hospital admitted majority responsibility which paved the way for the settlement approved today.

'Ruby's family have shown tremendous devotion and support to help her achieve the best quality of life possible over the last eight years, but the fact remains that her brain injury is so severe she needs specialist help from professionals and the settlement will now provide exactly that.'

At the High Court in Leeds, where the legal settlement was agreed, Judge Mark Gosnell told her parents they had faced a struggle for many years to care for their daughter and deal with the ongoing legal claim.

He said the settlement would enable them to secure in future a 'better family life for both you and Ruby' and he hoped the formal apology made by hospital chiefs would give them 'some feeling of closure'.
