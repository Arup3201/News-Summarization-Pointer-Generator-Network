Maddie the Koala found she had triple the load when two wandering joeys attached themselves to the mother-of-one at the Australian Reptile Park.

Marsupial keepers at the park on NSW central coast thought they were seeing triple when they discovered Maddie all of a sudden had three babies vying for her attention.

The staff got quite a shock to see Milly, Molly and Theresa - all less than one-year-old - hitching a ride on the back of Maddie.

Despite the two young koalas obviously finding the wrong way back to their tree after going off on an expedition, Maddie didn't question her new extra demanding role - she just soldiered on like a trooper while the energetic joeys kept her very busy.

The mother showed equal affection to all three babies - providing lots of group hugs as the babies vied for her attention. 

Four koalas have been born at the Australian Reptile Park in Somersby this year which is welcome news considering the impact land clearing is having on numbers.
