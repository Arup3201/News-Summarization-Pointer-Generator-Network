A senior Tory MP who earns thousands of pounds advising green energy firms today insisted it was 'reasonable' for electricity bills to rise by £100-a-year to help pay for more wind farms.

Tim Yeo, chairman of the Commons energy and climate change committee, leapt to the government's defence after it emerged deal between Tories and Lib Dems on Britain's power plans would see bills rise.

Electricity bills could rise by £75 a year by 2020 to fund a new generation of wind farms and nuclear reactors. And by 2030 annual bills will go up by an estimated £178 under all the Government’s green and fuel poverty policies.

Electric bills could rise by £75 a year to fund the green energy strategy to be unveiled next week

A green energy strategy to be unveiled next week will treble the costs levied on bills from £2.35billion a year to £7.6billion.

But Mr Yeo insisted it was not a problem.  'I personally think that a couple of pounds a week - maybe rising to almost £3 a week - is a reasonable price for Britain to achieve a degree of energy security to reduce its total dependence on fossil fuels and to honour its commitments to cut green house gases,' he told BBC Radio 4.

However Mr Yeo, who earns almost £140,000 from green energy companies, faced criticism from Conservative colleagues.

Douglas Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton, said: ‘The average constituent in Clacton is already paying between £10 and £20 extra for their electricity as a direct consequence of these hidden green surcharges.

‘If you have lots of non-executive payments from green energy companies, then perhaps another £2 or £3 a week doesn’t sound a large sum of money from your household budget.

‘For those in my constituency who do not have green energy directorships, then it is a lot of money.’

Earlier Energy Secretary Ed Davey dismissed claims of huge hikes in bills as 'utter rubbish' and claimed without the measures bills would rise even higher.

'The impact from supporting clean technologies is only 2% on peoples’ bills at the moment. By the end of the decade that will grow, and by 2020 will be about 7%,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

'We’re talking about under £100 in 2020. In 2012 today we’re talking just £20. The figures that are being bandied around are utter rubbish.

'If you take account of all our policies, which I think when you’re talking about energy you should look at all aspects of energy policy, and we are making measures on energy efficiency, which will help people save money.'

Victory: George Osborne won a battle of wills with Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary Ed Davey (right) who backed a target of cutting power station emissions to a seventh of their current level by 2030

In another development, plans for a drastic cap on carbon emissions have been slapped down by George Osborne.

The
Chancellor won a battle of wills with Mr Davey, a Liberal Democrat, who
backed a legally-binding target contained in the Coalition agreement.

The
Government’s climate advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, wanted 
to cut power station emissions to a seventh of their current level by 
2030 in order to meet Britain’s climate change commitments.

It
would have meant gas, which provides more than half of Britain’s power,
being phased out unless its emissions can be captured and stored using 
technology that does not even exist.

Mr
Osborne has rejected the call for the cap, which the Treasury feared 
would have driven up fuel prices and hit economic growth.

A
Whitehall source said of next week’s Energy Bill: ‘They have agreed 
there will be no target in this parliament, a decision on whether there 
will be one at all will not be taken until 2016.’

But it is understood the Treasury 
stood firm on green levies on electricity bills rising to no higher than
£95 a year by 2020 – compared with £20 currently.

The expected £178 increase by 2030 
would cover all the Government’s green and fuel poverty policies 
including investment in the power network.

How to keep the lights on while 
keeping household electricity bills at a reasonable level has bitterly 
divided the Coalition because a fifth of Britain’s power plants are set 
to close in the next decade.

Mr Davey told MPs this week that the negotiations on energy policy had been ‘challenging’.

Yesterday his spokesman said they had 
lost the battle for a ‘decarbonisation’ target. ‘We made no secret of 
our commitment to the target’, she said. ‘But we are pleased to have 
reached an agreement, which will send an important signal to investors 
and create 250,000 jobs.’

Mr Davey's department is committed to thousands more wind turbines despite opposition

The renewable energy industry is facing a crisis, Labour leader Ed Miliband warned yesterday.

He said firms were becoming confused by ‘mixed messages’ from David Cameron’s Government.

The Coalition should instead, he insisted, pledge that all of Britain’s electricity should come from non-carbon sources.

He said this would create thousands of jobs, adding: ‘This is absolutely in our economic interest.

‘We’ve got to be absolutely clear about this crisis our green industry is facing. And the crisis is caused by the huge uncertainty this Government is creating about its intention on climate change and energy.’

He claimed the Prime Minister’s commitment to the environment had ‘evaporated’ since he came to power in 2010.

Green groups were furious about the 
failure to sign up to a decarbonisation target for 2030, saying David Cameron had betrayed promises to lead the ‘greenest 
government ever’.

John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace, said: 'By failing to agree to any carbon target for the power sector until after the next election, David Cameron has allowed a militant tendency within his own ranks to derail the Energy Bill.'

Friends of the Earth's executive director Andy Atkins added: 'The coalition has caved in to Osborne's reckless dash for gas and banged the final nail in the coffin of Cameron's pledge to lead the greenest Government ever.'

Mr Osborne is sceptical about the costs of renewable 
energy, telling the Conservative party conference last year: ‘We are not
going to save the planet by putting our country out of business.’

Last week his father-in-law Lord 
Howell was secretly filmed by Greenpeace campaigners saying the 
Chancellor was putting pressure on the Prime Minister to abandon his 
environmental commitments.

Mr Osborne favours a ‘dash for gas’ as
the cheapest way to power the economy, and will announce a gas 
generation strategy in the coming weeks which is set to stoke further 
tensions with the Energy Secretary and environmental groups. The target 
recommended by the Government’s climate advisers was to force power 
stations to produce only 50g of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour by 
2030. Gas power currently emits around 350g.

Mr Davey said recently that he was 
‘absolutely committed’ to the target and that: ‘After 2030 we expect 
that gas will increasingly be used only as back-up, or fitted with 
carbon capture and storage technology.’

Britain is still committed to cutting 
emissions by 80 per cent by 2050 under the 2008 Climate Change Act. But 
campaigners and businesses doubt this can be achieved without 
overhauling the energy market to attract more than £100billion of 
investment in green power.

A generation of nuclear plants will be
built and Mr Davey’s department is committed to thousands more wind 
turbines, despite opposition from local communities and more than 100 
Conservative MPs.
