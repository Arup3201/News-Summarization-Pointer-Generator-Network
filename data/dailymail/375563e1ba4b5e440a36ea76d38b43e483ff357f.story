Four men died after their car smashed through a crash barrier in a high rise car park in Russia and plunged more than 40ft to the ground.

Russian police believe driver Anton Sergeyev hit the accelerator instead of the brake while he was manoeuvring in the car park in the Russian capital Moscow and shot forward over the edge.

Three passengers - Artem Kovalyov, Dmitry Mironov, and Maxim Kirillov - all died along with the driver. All four, according to police, were 24 years-old.

A witness said the car was 'squashed flat' and it was lucky no one was underneath when it fell

She added: 'Then there was the sound of brick hitting the ground and a sudden crash of something heavy and breaking glass

'I was just putting my own shopping in the boot of my car nearby, it was lucky there was no-one underneath. 

'I rushed over with other people in the area but there was little that could be done. The car had landed with such a thump it was squashed flat and those inside were completely mangled.

'It was terrible to see.'

Bystanders rushed over to help but 'there was little that could be done' because of the severity of the damage

The car smashed through the rail, tearing breeze blocks out of the wall
