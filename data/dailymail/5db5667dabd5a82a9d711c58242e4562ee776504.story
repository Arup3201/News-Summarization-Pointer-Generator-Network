Ageing, written off, derided. It just had to be Bobby Zamora who scored the £134million goal that took QPR back into the Premier League and quite probably saved them from financial ruin.

Having been dominated by Steve McClaren’s youthful and energetic Derby County for 89 minutes, 50 seconds, rickety old QPR and their 33-year-old centre forward only needed one late glimpse to separate the men from the boys.

County skipper Richard Keogh mistimed a clearance straight to the injury-prone striker and he returned it in a flash into the top corner of the net.

Harry Redknapp was besieged on the 
touchline, owner Tony Fernandes looked as if he’d just escaped a heart 
attack. With 10 second left, QPR were back in the promised land, and 
that despite playing the majority of the second-half with only 10 men 
following Gary O’Neil’s red card. Extraordinary scenes.

For
 two years, Rangers and Fernandes have rightly received savage criticism
 as a squad paid more than Borussia Dortmund were relegated and then 
failed to ignite the Championship.

Zamora
 was one of the poster-boys for underachievement. He went into 
yesterday’s showpiece at Wembley having scored four goals in 20 months, 
though in mitigation he missed four months of this season to recover 
from a knee operation.

And 
yet in a split-second, he showed the quality that once won him a couple 
of England caps and persuaded QPR to spend £6million on him at the start
 of 2012. His instant left-foot finish had Derby keeper Lee Grant 
clutching thin air. Keogh was inconsolable for the rest of the 
afternoon, and possibly all summer.

Zamora
 is one of 15 players out of contract at Loftus Road this season. It may
 turn out to be his last game in a Hoops shirt but even if that’s the 
case his place in the club’s history is now assured.

The
 club‘s latest financial figures reported a loss of £65m. Even by 
the unreal standards of the Championship play-off final, Rangers needed 
this result to go their way.

‘I don’t know how we did it,’ admitted a relieved and stunned Redknapp afterwards.

‘It
 was an amazing finish. We were hanging on and looking to get to 
extra-time. That was the only hope I could see for us with 10 men, I 
wanted to keep it tight and get to penalties, I’d be lying if I said 
otherwise.

‘I was surprised to score! But when Bobby is fit, he is an excellent player.

‘It
 was just a backs-to-the-wall job before then. I think we defended well 
with 10 men; Robert Green, Richard Dunne, Nedum Onouha, they all 
defended for their lives.’

Redknapp embraced Fernandes afterwards. Zamora’s stike has saved both from different types of oblivion.

Derby
 had finished the regular season in third place, five points ahead of 
Rangers, and were the better team at Wembley foiled repeatedly by QPR keeper Robert Green, whose own career is back on the up after his World Cup 
horribilis in 2010.

‘Football is a cruel game,’ said County manager Steve McClaren, who replaced Nigel Clough in September when the club were 14th.

‘We controlled the game, one lapse at the end and we lose. But I’m so proud of the players.

‘It
 is going to take few days and weeks to recover. We stayed on the field 
afterwards to applaud QPR and watch them celebrate and pick up the cup,
 go into the Premier League.

‘We
 don’t want that kind of hurt again, because it does hurt. Maybe we will
 try to go straight up next time! But if this team sticks together, it 
will get stronger.’

Despite a
 heavy and dramatic downpour as the teams came out, McClaren didn’t 
emerge with the brolly he infamously used on his last Wembley appearance
 as England manager in 2007.

The
 first half was largely forgettable with Lee Mason rightly waving away
 a Derby penalty appeal when Will Hughes jumped over Richard Dunne the 
only moment of controversy.

But
 as the sun peeped out at the start of the second half, the serious 
action began – and nearly all of it in and around the QPR penalty area.

Green made great saves from Jamie Ward, Craig Bryson and Simon Dawkins.
 Ward’s goalbound shot was blocked by his own player Chris Martin as 
Derby outran Rangers and laid siege to the goal.

Derby
 thought they’d cracked it after an hour. Johnny Russell nicked the ball
 past Dunne and when his heels were clipped by O’Neil, the 
Rangers man went after discussion between Mr Probert and his assistant.

County
 swarmed forward but the Rangers rearguard wouldn’t crack. From the 
side, McClaren must have rued the good work he did at the start of the 
season as QPR’s defensive coach before moving to Derby.

As
 they were pushed back in the closing stages, one thing Rangers could 
count on was bags of know how with Joey Barton, Karl Henry and Dunne in the side.

And 
defender Nedum Onouha admitted: ‘With the amount of experience we have 
in this side, even in adversity we have a second game plan. To get the 
result feels fantastic. We must love to do things the hard way but it 
means twice as much now.’

Extra-time
 looked inevitable until with the seconds ticking down, Derby sat back 
for the first time. Rangers won a couple of cheap throw-ins, Zamora 
loitered with intent in the penalty area and when the chance came, he 
changed history.
