Police in Aurora, Colorado, are searching for a man who they say tried to kidnap an 8-year-old girl after snatching her from her bedroom.

According to investigators, the girl screamed for help and somehow broke free early Monday morning. Her father ran outside and found her in an alley.

‘We think there's a predator out there. And he has to be caught, and he has to be stopped,' Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates said at a news conference. ‘I've been in this business a long time, and I've never seen anything like this.’

The girl's grandmother, Beatrice Padilla, told The Denver Post the girl was doing her homework in her bunk bed when the suspect opened up an unlocked window just after midnight Monday.  Another child was sleeping in the room at the time.

Police are offering a $10,000 reward - the second largest in the department’s history - for information leading to the predator’s arrest, The Denver Channel reported. 

Police responded to a home in the 1600 block of Hanover Street at around 12.15am after receiving a reporting of an attempted kidnapping.

Stalker: Police say the intruder likely saw the light in the girl's bedroom and was watching her before he removed the screen and opened an unlocked window

Investigators believe the perpetrator removed a screen, opened an unlocked window and grabbed the girl. Investigators believe he saw the light in her room and had been spying on her.

'He said, “I know your family”’, her grandmother said.

The intruder covered the girl's mouth with his hand as he carried her away, but the child, described by one neighbour as a ‘little tomboy,’ was able to call for help and break free.

The 8-year-old suffered minor injuries and was taken to a hospital as a precaution. She returned home by 5am, according to the station KDVR. 

Miss Padilla said her granddaughter was 'still in shock' following her kidnapping attempt. 

Sgt. Chris Amsler said there is no 
indication that the family knew the suspect, leading them to believe 
that it was a random act.
