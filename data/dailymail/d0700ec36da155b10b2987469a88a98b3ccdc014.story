On the eve of the game against the Atlanta Falcons at Wembley, the Detroit Lions have suspended CJ Mosley and sent him home.

The 31-year-old defensive tackle has received a fortnight’s suspension for conduct detrimental to the team and an unspecified violation of team rules.

The back-up is nevertheless considered one of the leaders in Detroit’s No 1 ranked defense and has played every game this year, recording 2.5 sacks. His absence will likely mean a greater workload for Ndamukong Suh and Nick Fairley. Caraun Reid and Jason Jason should see increased snaps too.

Rookie safety Jerome Couplin has been promoted from the practice squad to fill Mosley’s roster spot.

With a bye next week, Mosley will also miss the week 10 game against the Miami Dolphins.

Now in the his tenth NFL season, this is Mosley’s second year in Detroit, but he will become a free agent at the end of the season.
