Southampton are looking to buy Dundee's teenage striker Craig Wighton. 

The 17-year-old has impressed scouts enough for the club to offer £200,000. 

Swansea City and Sunderland have also watched him closely over the past season.

Dundee will find it hard to turn down offers but will look capitalise on one of Scotland's brightest young talents. 

Blackburn have also shown an interest in Wighton, who has been on loan at Brechin City since December 18.

The starlet made his first team debut last season for Dundee and became the club's youngest ever goalscorer against Riath Rovers in November, 2013.
