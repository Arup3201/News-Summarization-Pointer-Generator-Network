Madonna has sold her 6,000-square-foot Manhattan duplex overlooking Central Park but not before taking a $4million hit on her original asking price.

The sale of the vast six-bedroom apartment in Harperley Hall - on the corner of West 64th Street with large banks of windows facing Central Park - closed last week.

The property had been on the market for six months, it was first listed last November for $23.5 million before the price was cut by 15% in February to $19.995 million.

Madonna originally bought a condo in Harperley Hall with former husband Sean Penn back in the mid-80s

The new owner is hedge fund manager Deepak Narula, reports WSJ. A former mortgage-bond trader at Lehman Brothers, he is now the principal and managing partner of Metacapital Management, which oversees more than $10 billion in assets under management.

Madonna originally bought a condo in the building with former husband Sean Penn back in the mid-80s. Since then two other apartments have been added to create a sprawling duplex on the fifth and sixth floors.

It has 15 rooms, including eight bedrooms, five wood-burning fireplaces, a library, kitchen/diner and formal dining room. Two large living rooms with Juliet balconies and French doors open onto the park.

The master bedroom included  luxurious marble bathroom with Moorish arches, a steam shower and claw-foot tub.

The residence was decorated in an Art Deco style by Madonna's younger brother Christopher Ciccone, although judging from the photographic evidence it will require a serious refit

One person who may be celebrating the
aging popstar moving out of Harperley Hall is fellow resident Karen 
George who brought a lawsuit against the singer in 2009.

She accused Madonna of being a ‘noisy neighbor’ and claimed that the rehearsal studio in the singer's 
apartment subjected neighbors to 'blaring music, stomping and shaking 
walls' for up to three hours a day. They settled their dispute out of 
court in December 2011.

Madonna hasn't lived in the apartment for several years.

In 2009 she bought an Upper 
East Side townhouse for $32.5 million after splitting from second husband Guy Ritchie.

The property on East 81st Street near Third Avenue was once three adjacent townhouses  which she spent millions of dollars renovating before moving in.

When
she's not touring, Madonna - worth $650million - lives there with her four children Lourdes, Rocco, David and 
Mercy.
