Slurpee Australia hosted it's annual 'BYO Cup Day' at 7-11 stores nationwide on Monday, where anyone could fill up a cup brought from home for only $2.60 all day.

If you had been looking for a use for your 'Most Improved Ping Pong Player for 1996' trophy or a sun-bleached P&O pina colada cup you bought on that cruise five years ago, then this was it. 

Slurpee enthusiasts came out in force, taking advantage of the generosity of the company and putting their creative talents to the test.

One eager Slurpee fan decided a crock pot was his container of choice, filling it up with icy goodness today

Why not use a hollowed out rockmelon for your Slurpee?

Even using a bin liner in a wicker basket can work for some, as these three young Slurpee fans found out

The bigger the better- despite volume restrictions, these fans seem determined to make the most of BYO cup

Is a mop bucket big enough to fit all the icy goodness of BYO Cup Day?

From trick-or-treat buckets to popcorn containers, these Slurpee lovers tried it all!

Will four litres of Slurpee be enough to satisfy this thirsty customer?

Slurpee lovers stepped up to the BYO Cup Day challenge and posted hundreds of pictures of themselves

Monday saw every receptacle imaginable used as a container for multi-coloured, multi-flavoured, and brain-freeze inducing Slurpees.

For every standard water jug, giant saucepan and old mop bucket, there wass an unexpected fish tank, hollowed out rockmelon and garbage-bin-lined wicker basket.

For those wanting to join in the fun, there were only a few rules to keep in mind when pursuing that often elusive but now readily available Slurpee bang for your buck.

Number one, no holes. There's nothing worse than the precious nectar flowing from the Slurpee machine escaping out of your well-chosen vessel.

Olympian swimmer Emily Seebohm showed her appreciation, tweeting 'Best Day Ever!'

A P&O cuo and a water jug- perfect container for the challenge!

No more protein needed- just litres of multi-coloured icy fun!

KFC buckets might just do the trick for these girls

A straw isn't good enough for this fan- a ladle is the only way to go!

Number two, said container must not exceed 230mm by 260mm. This rule seems to be enforced more loosely than the first, perhaps because the novelty of seeing someone drag a kiddie pool into a convenience store far outweighs any monetary losses suffered.

Fans ranging from everyday Australians to athletes such as Emily Seebohm showed their appreciation for the iced treat, with the Olympian swimmer tweeting a photo of herself and her Slurpee with the caption 'Bring your own cup day! Best day of the year!'

The company also launched a competition encouraging customers to post their weird and wonderful Slurpee vessels. 

By posting a picture of their containers, they could win their 'head as a cup', and well as a year's supply of free Slurpee. 

Slurpee's photo competition has seen fans posting weird and wonderful BYO cups to their Facebook and Instagram pages since the early hours of Tuesday

Why not use an esky to keep your Slurpee cool all day? It's large and practical for slurping that icy treat

How about a novelty skull to drink from?

Cereal containers have no better use- ditch the Special K and fill them up with Slurpee!

Even an old plastic tray might just do the trick for some Slurpee fans

Make sure your straw is long enough to reach that multi-coloured Slurpee concoction!
