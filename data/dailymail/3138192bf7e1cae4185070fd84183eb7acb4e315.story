The mistress: French first lady Valerie Trierweiler was accused of 'embezzlement' because she is using taxpayers' money while not actually married

The French first lady was today accused of ‘embezzlement’ because she is using taxpayers’ money while not actually married.

In a criminal case which places a question mark against President Francois Hollande’s decision to have a live-in-lover, Miss Trierweiler is described as nothing more than a ‘mistress’.

Xavier Kemlin, a multi-millionaire Frenchman, insists that the 48-year-old magazine journalist ‘should not take advantage’ of public funds.

He has filed the complaint at a criminal court in Saint-Etienne, in the Loire department of eastern France.

It
states that the presidential couple ‘are neither married, nor civil 
partners,’ and that ‘our taxes’ should not have to ‘house, feed, pay the
staff and travel of a woman with whom taxpayers have ‘no link in law’.

Despite being an avowed Socialist, Mr 
Trierweiler has become noted for her luxury lifestyle since moving into 
the Elysee Palace last year.

She not only has access to official homes, cars and planes, but also retains her own office and staff.

Mr
Kemlin, a French taxpayer who lives in Switzerland, is furious at the 
huge increases in charges being introduced by her husband’s government. 
They include a proposed 75 per cent top rate of income tax.

Mr
Kemlin mocked Ms Trierweiler’s continued support for gay marriage, 
while being nothing more than the girlfriend of a politician who has 
never wed. 

He said the situation made France ‘the laughing stock of all head of state’ during visits around the world.

Although Ms Trierweiler could 
technically go to prison for the offence of embezzlement, Mr Kemlin said
his criminal was meant to highlight ‘the ambiguous relationship’ she 
had with the president.

Last
year it emerged that Ms Trierweiler was once the shared mistress of Mr 
Hollande and married conservative minister, Patrick Devedjian – all 
while she was still married to her second husband.

Mr Hollande was at the time living with Segolene Royal, the mother of his four children and a senior Socialist politician in her own right.

Miss Trierweiler, a former political affairs reporter who now writes arts pieces for Paris Match, is nicknamed ‘Valerie Rottweiler’ and ‘First Concubine’ by the French media because of her unpopularity.

Last June, she sent a Twitter message encouraging voters to support a rival to Miss Royal in parliamentary elections.

Miss Royal went on to lose the election and since then neither she, nor her four children with Mr Hollande, have spoken to Miss Trierweiler, accusing her of a ‘stab in the back’.

The mutual loathing between Miss Royal and Miss Trierweiler is regularly highlighted.
