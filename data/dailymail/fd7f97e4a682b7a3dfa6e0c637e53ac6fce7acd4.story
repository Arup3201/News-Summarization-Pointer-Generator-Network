Murdered: Police have confirmed that 17-year-old Georgia Williams died from 'pressure to the neck'

Teenage murder victim Georgia Williams was probably choked to death with a ligature, police have revealed.

Earlier today Detective Superintendent Adrian McGee said the 17-year-old died from 'pressure to her neck'.

A post-mortem examination found she had suffered 'strangulation' injuries probably caused by having a ligature wrapped around her throat.

A West Mercia police spokesman added: 'The guidance being given is that she probably died as a result of strangulation injuries.

'This would be different to being 'strangled' which suggests someone putting their hands around her.

'It is likely a ligature of some sort was used.'

Detectives also said Georgia's body had been formally identified, four days after she was found dead in woodland near Wrexham.

The results of the post mortem examination were held at Wellington Civic Centre at the same time that her friend Jamie Reynolds appeared at court, charged with murder.

The 22-year-old has yet to enter a plea and was remanded in custody until his next hearing on September 6.

Wearing a yellow top with a green collar via prison video-link he spoke only to give his name, acknowledge the judge and to confirm that he understood proceedings.

Speaking as Georgia's inquest was opened and adjourned, Detective Superintendent Adrian McGee said: 'I can now confirm that the body found in woodland off the Nant-y-Garth pass near Wrexham on Friday afternoon has been formally identified as that of 17-year-old Georgia Williams.

'Although we are not in a position to release any further details for legal reasons, and out of respect for the Williams family at this terribly sad time, I am also able to confirm that Georgia died as a result of pressure being applied to her neck.'

Police arrested Reynolds in Glasgow last Wednesday and charged him with murder on Friday following the discovery of a body in woodland near Wrexham.

Georgia, whose parents were not in court, went missing from her home in Wellington on Sunday, May 26.

Detectives today renewed their appeal for members of the public to get in touch if they find the teenager's missing personal items, including her phone, jacket and make-up bag.

DS McGee added: 'Although the investigation has progressed quite quickly over the past few days, there is still a lot of work for us to do.

'We are continuing to look for the missing bag, make-up bag, mobile phone and clothing that belonged to Georgia and searches are still ongoing to locate this property.

'The bag is a distinctive spotty leather satchel and her smart phone is a white Samsung Galaxy Y. The make-up bag is pink with a flowered pattern and contained various items of make-up.

'The missing coat is described as a waist-length black leather-type jacket with a stand-up collar, which she was wearing when she was last seen leaving her family's home in Wellington at 7.30pm on Sunday May 26.

'Locating these items is still extremely important to us, while we also remain keen to hear from anyone who believes they may have seen the Toyota Hiace 300 GS panel van, registration number CX06 ASV, on Monday 27 or Tuesday 28 May.

'If anyone believes they still have information that could aid our investigation I would like to ask that they share it with us as soon as they can, even if they are unsure whether the information is related to this case.'
