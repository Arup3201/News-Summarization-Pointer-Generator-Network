Team news

Sunderland 

Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet will welcome defenders Billy Jones and Santiago Vergini back into his squad for Sunday's Barclays Premier League visit of Manchester United.

Jones missed the 2-2 draw with former club West Brom last weekend because of a troublesome hamstring, while Vergini is understood to have sat out because of an administrative problem - but both will be available this weekend.

That means Poyet's only significant absentee will be Italian midfielder Emanuele Giaccherini, who continues his recovery from a groin injury.

Provisional squad: Mannone, Pantilimon, Jones, Van Aanholt, Brown, O'Shea, Vergini, Roberge, Cattermole, Bridcutt, Rodwell, Gomez, Larsson, Johnson, Buckley, Mavrias, Wickham, Fletcher, Altidore, Graham.

Manchester United 

Striker Robin van Persie is fully fit and available for Manchester United's game at Sunderland on Sunday.

Midfielders Michael Carrick, Marouane Fellaini and Ander Herrera (all ankle) are out, as is utility man Jesse Lingard, who has a knee injury, but Antonio Valencia has recovered from the leg problem that kept him out of the defeat to Swansea.

Defenders Jonny Evans (leg), Luke Shaw (hamstring) and Marcos Rojo (awaiting work permit) are unavailable while doubts remain over right-back Rafael (groin) and striker Danny Welbeck (knee), who has also been told he can leave the club.

Provisional squad: De Gea, Lindegaard, Amos, Rafael, Valencia, Smalling, Jones, M Keane, Blackett, James, Fletcher, Cleverley, Anderson, Young, Mata, Kagawa, Zaha, Januzaj, Van Persie, Rooney, Welbeck, Hernandez, Powell, W Keane.

Manchester United have conceded just two goals in their last seven trips to the Stadium of Light in the Premier League.

Wayne Rooney has scored 81 Premier League away goals, only six short of Alan Shearer’s all-time record.

Manchester United ended the 2013-14 season with exactly the same away record as Chelsea and Manchester City (W10 D4 L5)

New kid on the block: Adnan Januzaj (left) scored twice as Manchester United came from behind to win 2-1 at Sunderland in their Premier League clash at the Stadium of Light last October

After assisting a goal in each of his opening three Premier League appearances for Manchester United, Juan Mata has assisted only one more in 13 games for them.

Sunderland have scored at least once in 10 of their last 11 Premier League games.

The Black Cats have won four of their last six league games, including victories against Chelsea and Manchester United.

Manchester United have lost 13 Premier League games since September 1 last year.

Adnan Januzaj has assisted only one goal in his last 14 Premier League appearances.

Sebastian Larsson’s goal on the opening day equalled his haul in both 2013-14 and 2012-13. He scored seven times in his first season for Sunderland.
