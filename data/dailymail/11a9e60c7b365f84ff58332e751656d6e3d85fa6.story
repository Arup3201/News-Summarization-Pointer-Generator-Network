Women in Australia are earning a record 18.8 per cent less per week than their male counterparts, a shocking new report has found.

The gender pay gap between everyday Australians is the worst it’s been in more than twenty years, despite an ever-growing movement  calling for equal pay for men and women.

Data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) shows the average ordinary full-time earnings for men rose to $1,587.50 per week, while their female colleagues received $298.10 less.

It is the largest pay gap recorded since the ABS began collecting the data in 1994.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Prime Minister Tony Abbott – who also acts as the Minister for Women – for comment.

Associate Professor Rae Cooper from the University of Sydney Business School’s Discipline of Work and Organisational Studies told Daily Mail Australia the findings are even more shocking because it’s the second year in a row the gap has grown.

‘I was shocked last time around when it was the highest in 20 years at 18.2 per cent and now it’s 18.8 per cent,’ Professor Cooper said.

‘It’s really concerning in a sense because there’s only been a modest wage growth. Wages have only gone up a little bit but the gap has grown massively.’

The reasons the gap keeps growing are complex, Professor Cooper said.

‘There is sticky floor, that’s the biggest cause, women get stuck in low level non-career track jobs,' she said.

'But it’s also a story about glass walls. Women are segregated into particular industries and those industries are low paid.’

Across the board the pay gap of average weekly ordinary time earnings is about $300 a week

Some employers – particularly large ones – are now giving more information on the scale of the problem and where it is but Professor Cooper said ‘what we’re not seeing is a lot of movement in response’.

‘How many times can we hear that there is a pay gap in every occupation and every level, it’s not a question of if there is one but the scale of it.’

Professor Cooper said that across the board the pay gap of average weekly ordinary time earnings is about $300 a week. This number does not include part time workers, casual staff or bonuses.

Women who work in education have about a $200 gap from their male counterparts. Men in education earn $1,700 a week on average and women get $1,486.

In finance, there is a $600 gap and mining there is an almost $500 gap.

Men in the mining industry earn an average a week $2459.50, while women get $2014.

Essentially, women in Australia 'should take Friday off to compensate for the 18.8 per cent difference', Professor Cooper joked.

The ABS’s findings were released after Employment Minister Eric Abetz announced plans to scale back business red tape on gender reporting. 

Extra gender reporting requirements were due to apply from April 1 covering job applications, interviews, the salaries of chief executives and parental leave.

The government says after public consultation it will scrap the extra requirements but maintain existing arrangements.

However, it’s believed the Liberal's plans may fail in the Senate. 

Under laws introduced by the previous Labor government, businesses with 100 or more employees are required to provide the Workplace Gender Equality Agency with data on pay, recruitment, retention and promotions.

Australian Greens senator Larissa Waters has flagged a disallowance motion in the Senate if she can't convince the government to change its mind.

Senator Waters said data on managerial level job applications and interviews was critical because it would show where the glass ceiling was most impenetrable.
