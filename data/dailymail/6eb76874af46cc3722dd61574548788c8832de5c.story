Shopkeeper John Seabright, who fought off two armed raiders who barged into the shop where he works by spraying cleaning fluid at them 

A shopkeeper fought off two hammer-wielding robbers who demanded he open the till by arming himself with surface cleaner and spraying it into their eyes.

John Seabright, 62, was behind the counter of the Londis shop in Bourton-on-the-Water in Gloucestershire when two masked thugs barged in and screamed at him to hand over cash.

At first he tried to grab the hammer of one of the balaclava-clad raiders but he failed.

So instead he reached for the £1 bottle of Mr Muscle surface cleaner used to clean the till, and sprayed it straight into the eyes of the men through the holes of their balaclavas.

That sent the robbers fleeing empty-handed with their eyes streaming.

Mr Seabright said: 'They just burst in through the doors while I was serving. My very first thought was someone was playing a prank.

'They were wearing tracksuits and ski masks and they started screaming to open up the till and waving the hammer about.

'I thought that there was no way they are coming for the tills. I just said no and told them to get out.

'He couldn't reach me with the hammer unless he threw it at me. Another customer tried to tackle him so I tried to grab the hammer but I didn't get it.

'I saw there was some cleaning spray so I picked it up and I sprayed him in the eyes between the balaclava.

'It must have hurt because that was it - he scarpered, him and his mate. I think it made them just give up and scared them off.'

Shop supervisor Mr Seabright was working with colleague Jim Wilsdon, 21, when the armed pair stormed the shop.

CCTV footage from the shop shows the two robbers, dressed in grey and white hooded tops, barge into the store and make their way towards the counter 

After demanding he open the till for them, Mr Seabright, circled, can be seen reaching for the cleaning fluid bottle and spraying it in one of the raiders' eyes 

Mr Wilsdon then ushered customers - including a frightened woman and her baby - into the shop's bakery to hide while Mr Seabright tackled the thugs.

The 62-year-old, who has worked at the shop for 15 years, said: 'I have to admit that my hands were shaking when I called 999, but I can't say I was really scared.

'I was fine after I had called them and actually I was serving customers before the police arrived, and back at work there at 7am the next day.'

General manager of the store Ewen Smith said that he was proud of his staff's reaction.

He added: 'They tried to use scare tactics to make John open the tills but John was very instinctive and, after asking him to leave, he blasted the man in the eyes with cleaning product.'

The raider wearing the light coloured top managed to flee after Mr Seabright started spraying the cleaning fluid and waited at the door for his accomplice 

Mr Seabright's wife Sheila, 70, admitted she was initially angry he had tackled the robbers - but said she was very proud of his bravery.

She said: 'Let's just say he got a frosty reception when he came in - I was just so worried. I'm proud of him though, really proud.

'He's had half of the village going into the shop and congratulating him and shaking his hand saying he is wonderful.'

The first raider has been described as 5ft 6in to 5ft 11in tall, stocky and wearing a light grey hooded tracksuit top, light grey jogging bottoms and grey face covering, possibly a ski mask.

The second was taller and thinner and had a light-coloured jogging top and bottoms that appear to be darker than the top.

Police say no arrests have so far been made.

Soon after police arrived the store, they then found themselves called to a second similar raid at Ladbrokes in Bishop's Cleeve, 19 miles away.

Two masked robbers threatened a staff member with a hammer before demanding money and made off with 'a few hundred pounds'.

Detectives suspect the two incidents are connected.

But despite praising the actions of Mr Seabright, Gloucestershire Constabulary warn against tackling robbers.

A spokesman said: 'The victim’s actions in fighting off the robbers were courageous but we do not recommend people do this generally.

'You simply do not know how an offender may react, or if they would use the weapon they are carrying, so you could be putting yourself at serious risk of harm.'
