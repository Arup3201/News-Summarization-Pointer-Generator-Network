Several aviation firms have embarked on a makeover this week – something airlines usually do once every 20 years.

The first carrier to unveil a new look was Southwest Airlines which revealed an overhaul of the design and colour of its livery.

It replaced the old canyon blue for a darker shade and rethought the stripes on the tail as well as adding new fonts and a yellow, red and blue heart underneath the plane - to show it cares.

Caring: Southwest Airlines also unveiled a heart to represent the care the carrier puts into its product

Gary Kelly, Southwest Airlines' CEO told CNN: ‘The heart emblazoned on our aircraft, and within our new look, symbolizes our commitment that we'll remain true to our core values as we set our sights on the future.’

But not to be outdone, Frontier Airlines announced it too would undergo a redesign, which will hark back to its past.

The first Frontier Airlines closed down in 1986, but the airline has now borrowed design elements from the original livery, including the stylized, Saul Bass-designed F in the brand name.

Both Southwest and Frontier's redesigns were leaked on Twitter ahead of the official announcements.

An aviation expert suggests that the airline's new designs signify that they are going through a change in corporate identity.

Both are completing deals - Southwest will finalize a takeover of AirTran Airways in the near future and Frontier is attempting to cash in on the budget market by becoming a low-cost carrier.

New Frontier: Frontier Airlines redesigned its fleet as well this week, with the trademark array of animals on the tail staying  but it has reverted to an older version of the Frontier logo

Specifications: The airline has thought through every single detail of its new design for its brand

Jonny Clark, an airline brand specialist and founder of thedesignair.net told CNN that airline liveries have a shelf life of 20 years or so.

But lately there's been a spate of aircraft redesigns.

Other airlines which have decided to rebrand include: Air New Zealand, American and Iberia.

Other airlines on the brink of doing the same are Abu Dhabi airline Etihad.

‘In the last couple of years, there's been an influx of new aircraft into a lot of fleets: 777s and A380s.

‘A lot of airlines have taken advantage of this opportunity to create a point of differentiation,’ explains Clark.

American and European brands, he notes, tend to follow a similar aesthetic, known as ‘Eurowhite’ known for its simplicity.

But not all airlines want to follow the current trend.

Several carriers in the Pacific Rim have liveries reflecting local design culture.

Hawaiian Airlines introduced its regional subsidy, 'Ohana by Hawaiian,' using a local aesthetic when crafting the new livery this year.

The carrier teamed up with father-and-son design team Sig and Kuha'o Zane to craft a look that honoured the local culture.

Fiji Airways also re-branded itself earlier this year drawing inspiration from Fijian Masi art, and used motifs, particularly the Teteva symbol on the tail.

Last year, Bangkok Airways introduced kid-friendly mascots on its livery to appeal to families. In general, the airline is known for its colorful planes.

New Caledonia airline Aircalin is another airline which updated its livery this year when it received its first delivery of A320s. 

The airline took traditional symbols of the region -- the hibiscus flower and Kanak art -- to create a  new look.

And in the run-up to the 2012 Olympics, liveries were used to market the games.

To mark Hello Kitty's 40th birthday, Taiwan's Eva Air introduced the Hello Kitty Jet to more locations around the world.

However, one airline that has taken branding to another level is Air New Zealand.

It partnered with the Lord of the Rings franchise, creating Tolkien-themed safety videos, and emblazoned the aircraft with a new decal each time a new film was released in cinemas.

But although rebranding has worked for some carriers, it  does not always have the desired affect.

In 1997, former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher famously showed her disgust for a British Airways tail fin redesign at a party conference.

BA had recently ditched the Union Flag on its tail fins, replacing them with a series of unusual ethnic designs.

But Thatcher was so alarmed at the sight of it that she took a handkerchief from her sleeve and covered the 747’s tail, pronouncing it ‘awful’.
