A teenager has died during his gap year trip in Thailand after falling from a train while he tried to have a sneaky cigarette.

Matt Lawlor, 19, described by his father as a 'rising star', is thought to have been standing in the area between two carriages when he fell from the moving train.

The teenager, from Bengeo, Hertfordshire, was travelling with friends from Bangkok to Koh Phangan but had stepped outside to smoke because it was banned inside the carriage.

His body was found lying in bushes next to the tracks, the day after the incident took place, on May 8.

Matt - who was due to return home later this month and had been in Thailand for just five days - was a budding film director who was due to start a film studies degree at Brighton University in September.

His father Peter, 59, said: 'He was really quirky, really funny and extremely intelligent. He was a rising star.'

Matt had started his gap year adventure in January when he flew to Australia with friend Alex Bartels.

They
 were originally intending to return to England in July, but Matt had 
decided to fly home on May 29 because after becoming homesick.

His
 parents, who have two other children, had planned to meet their son at 
Heathrow airport with his favourite homemade chocolate cake.

Matt, who was due to start a film studies degree at Brighton University in September, had been in the country just five days when the incident took place. He was due to return home to his parents later this month

His father said: 'I was so looking forward to seeing him and giving him a big dad hug.'

His mother Deborah, 50, said her son was passionate boy and music was 'everything to him'.

She said: 'His major love was music. Music was everything to him and he absolutely loved films.

'He also loved animals and I'm so happy that while he was out there he got to see so much nature and wildlife.'

Mr Lawlor added: 'For his coursework he had to make a film and they liked it so much, they are using it to show to other students.

'He was really hard-working and really dedicated. He wanted to finance the trip himself.'

The Foreign Office said consular assistance was being provided to the family.Â
