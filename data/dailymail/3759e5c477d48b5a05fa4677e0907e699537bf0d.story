Fear gripped a large swathe of the US last night as the hunt went on for a rogue ex-police officer whose revenge killing spree has claimed three lives.

Police and federal agents seeking heavily armed Christopher Dorner fear the Navy-trained survival expert and crack shot may launch a Rambo-style guerrilla war or try to go out in a blaze of glory.

Dorner, 33, who was sacked from the Los Angeles Police Department in 2008 for lying about an officer he had accused of misconduct, has threatened in a rambling ‘manifesto he published on Facebook to bring ‘warfare’ to the LAPD and to avenge himself by killing officers and their families.

Hunting: The officers continued to search for Dorner into the night - even though a massive snowstorm was scheduled for the mountain community

Ominously, he vowed to ‘utilise every
bit of small arms training, demolition, ordinance and survival training
I’ve been given’ and even claimed he has shoulder-launched missiles to 
target any helicopters used to pursue him.

Although the search for Dorner has 
extended across three states and even to Mexico, police were last night 
concentrating on combing the snowy San Bernardino mountains 100 miles 
east of Los Angeles after Dorner’s truck was found set on fire on 
Thursday afternoon on a forestry road near Big Bear.

Footprints from the vehicle led off through the snow into the surrounding forest but disappeared when they got to frozen ground.

Police officers spent all night 
searching in sub-zero temperatures and the hunt continued yesterday, 
using snowcats and armoured personnel carriers to reach mountain huts 
where Dorner may be hiding. Locals were warned to stay locked in their 
homes.

Dorner, who served with the US Navy in
Iraq, went on the run with a small arsenal of weapons after shooting 
dead a policeman and a couple connected to another former colleague.

Monica Quan, a sports coach, was 
killed with her fiancé Keith Lawrence as they sat in their car outside 
their home in Irvine, California, on Sunday.

Miss Quan, 27, was the daughter of a 
former police captain, Randal Quan, who represented Dorner in his failed
appeal against his dismissal from the LAPD and who Dorner blamed for 
bungling his case.

On Wednesday night, after trying to 
steal a boat to escape to Mexico, Dorner drove inland, shooting at 
police officers at random.

In the early hours of Thursday, he 
shot at two officers assigned to protect one of his suspected targets in
Corona, California, grazing one in the head. Less than an hour later, 
he pulled up next to a police car waiting at traffic lights in the 
neighbouring town of Riverside and ambushed the officers inside with an 
assault rifle.

A 34-year-old policeman was killed and his partner seriously wounded.

As panicked officers tried to protect 
not only Dorner’s likely targets but also themselves, innocent people 
were caught in the crossfire.

A mother and daughter delivering 
newspapers were wounded and their pick-up truck riddled with bullets 
after nervous police in the wealthy LA suburb of Torrance mistook their 
vehicle for Dorner’s. Minutes later, other Torrance officers shot at 
another vehicle in a second case of mistaken identity, although no one 
was injured.

Psychiatrists say that, unlike most spree killers, Dorner does not appear to be psychotic.

A picture of the hulking, heavily 
muscled African-American emerged as a single man who is amicable and 
very intelligent, but highly sensitive about race issues. Dorner joined 
the navy after university in 2001, undergoing extensive combat and 
counter-terrorism training. In 2005, while still in the military, he 
applied to join the LAPD.

During police training, superiors said
he had a problem with authority but he still joined. Within months he 
was called back into service by the navy and spent 13 months in Bahrain.

Returning to the LAPD to complete his training, he complained to colleagues that the force was racist.

Fully protected: Three police officers stand guard after Dorner's alleged shooting of two LAPD cops in Corona this morning

Revenge: Dorner, also a former Naval reservist, is suspected of shooting three police officers, one fatally early Thursday after the cops tried to apprehend him

Dorner's manifesto also included bizarre messages to some of his favorite athletes, actors, politicians and comedians.

TIM TEBOW: You are not a good QB by todays standards, but you are a great football player who knows how to lead a team and WIN. You will be “Tebowing” when you reach your next team.

ELLEN DEGENERES: Continue your excellent contribution to entertaining America and bringing the human factor to entertainment. You changed the perception of your gay community and how we as Americans view the LGBT community.

CHARLIE SHEEN: Charlie Sheen, you’re effin awesome.

JEFFREY TOOBIN and DAVID GERGEN: you are political geniuses and modern scholars

Larry David, Kevin Hart, the late Patrice Oneal, Lisa Lampanelli, Chris Rock, Jerry Seinfeld, Louis CK, Dave Chapelle, Jon Stewart, Wanda Sykes, Dennis Miller, and Jeff Ross are pure geniuses.

PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH: They never give you enough credit for your successful Presidency. You were always one of my favorite Presidents (2nd favorite). I hope your health improves greatly. You are the epitome of an American and service to country.

He accused his patrol partner – who 
had been critical of him – of kicking a mentally ill man in the face but
an investigation concluded he was lying and he was fired. He appeared 
so angry that police officials summoned armed guards to stand watch.

He spent the next couple of years appealing unsuccessfully.

In his 6,000-word ‘manifesto’ on 
Facebook, in which he bizarrely paid tribute to dozens of his favourite 
celebrities, Dorner demanded a public apology from the LAPD – a move 
that police chiefs ruled out. He said he would avenge himself by killing
officers and even their families.

‘I never had the opportunity to have a
family of my own... so I am terminating yours,’ he wrote. Accusing the 
authorities of misjudging a ‘sleeping giant’ he warned of warfare ‘to 
those in LAPD uniform whether on or off duty.

‘Unfortunately, I will not be alive to
see my name cleared. That’s what this is about, my name. A man is 
nothing without his name. Self-preservation is no longer important to 
me. I do not fear death as I died long ago.’

Yesterday, as thousands of heavily 
armed police patrolled the highways of southern California and  others 
guarded the homes of people he vowed to attack, police chief Charlie 
Beck urged Dorner to surrender.

He admitted their quarry might prove difficult to track down.

‘Of course he knows what he’s doing: 
we trained him. He was also a member of the armed forces,” Mr Beck said.
‘It is extremely worrisome and scary.’

Mistake: Police shot at this truck after believing Dorner was inside. Two people were wounded but were expected to survive

Damage: A close-up look at the many bullet holes in the pickup truck driven by a woman and her 71-year-old mother delivering newspapers

Be alert: Police issued a state-wide alert for Dorner's vehicle, telling people to call 911 if they see him
