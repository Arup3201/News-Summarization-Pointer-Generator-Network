Cynthia Hall, headmistress of Wycombe Abbey School, fears some of her most talented pupils could miss out on places at universities because they have been unfairly denied A*s

The exams regulator today said it will look again at GCSE gradings amid claims that thousands of students have been treated unfairly.

Ofqual admitted there were 'questions about how grade boundaries were set in a very small number of units across the year'.

The move comes amid threats of legal action from local authorities and teachers.

It was revealed this week that the proportion of GCSEs - taken by pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - awarded an A*-C grade had fallen for the first time in 24 years.

In a letter to the National Association of Head Teachers, Ofqual chief regulator Glenys Stacey wrote: 'We recognise the continuing concerns among students, parents and teachers about this year’s GCSE English results.

'We will look closely at how the results were arrived at. We will do this quickly, but thoroughly, so that we ensure confidence is maintained in our examinations system.'

Ms Stacey said she expected to gather evidence over the next week and that Ofqual would then meet awarding bodies to discuss its findings.

A Department for Education spokeswoman said: 'We welcome this move'.

Headteachers yesterday demanded the remarking of hundreds of thousands of GCSE papers and threatened exam boards with legal action amid an escalating ‘grade-fixing’ scandal.

In a furious letter to Education Secretary Michael Gove, they called for an urgent inquiry into the ‘manifest unfairness’ of ‘appalling’ marking in this summer’s GCSE English exams.

The National Association of Head Teachers, representing 28,500 heads and deputies, called for all English exams sat in the summer to be regraded against more lenient criteria used for papers taken earlier in the year.

Under fire: Education Secretary Michael Gove has received a furious open letter from headteachers calling for an urgent inquiry into the 'manifest unfairness' of 'appalling' marking in this summer's GCSE English exams

A second union, the Association of 
School and College Leaders, which has more than 17,000 members, echoed 
calls for an independent inquiry and revealed it was considering legal 
action against exam boards on the grounds that ethnic minority pupils 
and those from poor homes are likely to have been hit hardest by the 
fiasco.

Private school 
heads joined the outcry, including the headmistress of this year’s top 
school for A-levels, who warned that results in GCSE English appear to 
have been ‘artificially depressed’.

Cynthia Hall, head of £31,950-a-year 
Wycombe Abbey School, fears that some of her most talented pupils could 
miss out on places at leading universities because they have been 
unfairly denied A*s.

The 
man who investigated a similar grading scandal in 2002 added his voice 
to calls for an independent inquiry and encouraged examiners with 
knowledge of what happened to blow the whistle.

Sir Mike Tomlinson’s inquiry into the deliberate downgrading of A-levels led to nearly 2,000 grades being changed.

He
 told the Mail the problems with English GCSE had ‘all the similarities’
 with the A-level fiasco a decade ago, which ultimately led to the 
resignation of the then Education Secretary Estelle Morris.

‘Someone
 needs to look at it because I suspect that there will be a growing 
dissatisfaction with the system. Sooner or later that has to be 
diffused,’ he told the Mail.

‘I don’t know what the best mechanism is but something needs to be done to reassure students and teachers one way or the other.’

He added: ‘Teachers have said it’s changed, the boards have got to say it hasn’t or the papers were more difficult or whatever.’

If
 an examiner has felt there had been pressure to change the grade 
boundaries, ‘someone has to squeal and say “we were leaned on”'.

The
 mounting furore will pile pressure on Education Secretary Michael Gove,
 who has been accused of exerting political pressure over results, as 
well as exam boards and the standards watchdog Ofqual.

The
 row follows the first fall in 24 years in the number of A* to C grades 
awarded at GCSE, from 69.8 per cent to 69.4 per cent. English results 
fell 1.5 points to 63.9 per cent, and English literature 2.1 points to 
76.3 per cent.

Ofqual had issued a directive to exam boards to do more to contain grade inflation.

Concern
 is centred around English because changes to syllabuses this year 
presented boards with a tougher challenge maintaining standards on last 
year.

They appear to have 
set grade boundaries too low for papers taken earlier in the two-year 
course – effectively resulting in too many students getting good grades –
 and took corrective action this summer to avoid significant grade 
inflation.

This involved 
raising grade boundaries for exams taken in June. Pupils who took one 
task set by the AQA board in January needed 54 per cent of the marks to 
get a C but had to get 66 per cent for a similar assignment taken in 
June.

Heads claim it is 
unfair because pupils taking exams at earlier sittings will have been at
 a distinct advantage over those who took their final exams in June.

They
 also say that ‘changing the goalposts’ means that pupils who believed 
they were on course for good grades in the summer inexplicably dipped.

'Shambles': Russell Hobby, General Secretary of the National Association of Head teachers, said it was not fair to discriminate against pupils because they sat their exam in June rather than January

Russell
 Hobby, general secretary of the NAHT, branded the problems a 
‘shambles’, adding: ‘It is simply not fair to damage the opportunities 
of young people in this way, discriminating against them purely because 
they sat their exam in June rather than January. 

‘Not
 only does it offend natural justice, this manifestly inconsistent mark 
scheme risks putting question marks over the grades achieved in January,
 too. Parents are up in arms at what they see as the denigration of 
their child's hard work and effort.

‘As such, we are calling for an independent inquiry as to how this situation has been allowed to happen. 

‘We
 are also asking for all papers from June to be remarked using January’s
 criteria, thereby ensuring young people are not adversely penalised by 
this unfair and illogical system.’

Meanwhile
 the ASCL is backing an investigation started by England’s largest 
academy chain into the backgrounds of pupils denied grades vital to 
their future lives by exam board decisions, the Times Educational 
Supplement reported.

Brian 
Lightman, ASCL general secretary, said: ‘We suspect the very ad hoc 
decision that was made to lift the grade boundaries has 
disproportionately affected certain groups of students and so we think 
it is very worthwhile to examine this further and gather evidence.

‘If we are advised that legal action is the right way to challenge this, then that is what we will do.’

Legal
 action over the controversy is also being mooted by individual schools 
and local authorities including Bradford and Leeds. 

But
 this is the first suggestion that it could focus on alleged 
discrimination against the already disadvantaged - an outcome that could
 be deeply embarrassing for ministers who have pledged to improve the 
education of under-privileged pupils.  

Shadow
 Education Secretary Stephen Twigg has written to the Commons education 
select committee calling on it to hold an inquiry into English GCSEs 
this summer.

‘I have been 
told of cases where candidates who took GCSE English this summer and 
submitted their coursework for moderation in June were awarded a grade 
D, whereas if they had submitted that same coursework for moderation in 
January they would have received a grade C,’ he said.

The Labour-controlled Welsh Assembly has already launched its own review of GCSE English.

Leighton Andrews, the administration’s education minister, accused Mr Gove of politicising the system.

‘It's
 a shame that we're seeing politics brought into the exam process by the
 secretary of state for education in England, Michael Gove,' he told BBC
 Wales. ‘When Michael Gove says jump, the head of Ofqual says “how 
high?”.’
