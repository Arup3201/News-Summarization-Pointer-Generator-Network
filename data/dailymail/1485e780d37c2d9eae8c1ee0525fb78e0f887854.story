The top 
federal prosecutor in Manhattan announced Wednesday that he is suing Bank of America for more than $1 
billion for mortgage fraud against Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac during the years around the financial crisis.

U.S. 
Attorney Preet Bharara said Countrywide Financial, which was later 
bought by Bank of America, churned out mortgage loans from 2007 to 2009 
without making sure that borrowers could afford them.

'The 
fraudulent conduct alleged in today’s complaint was spectacularly brazen
in scope,' Bharara said in a statement. He said the suit was partly to 
recover money that Fannie and Freddie lost from defaulted loans.

Foreclosure: An internal review at Countrywide found that 57 percent of Hustle loans went into default

Bank of America had no immediate comment.

Countrywide
sold the loans to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were left to pay 
for the loans when they defaulted, according to the lawsuit. Fannie and 
Freddie were effectively nationalized in 2008.

According 
to the lawsuit, Countrywide used a process called 'the Hustle,' 
shorthand for 'High-Speed Swim Lane.' The idea was that mortgage loans, 
as they were being processed, would 'move forward, never backward.'

The 
lawsuit alleged that Countrywide traded quantity for quality and 
eliminated underwriters, even from mortgage loans for which borrowers 
did not have to get their income verified.

Instead, 
loan processors simply entered data into an automated underwriting 
system, and if the system gave the go-ahead, 'no underwriter would ever 
see the loan,' the lawsuit alleged.

With few checks and balances, there was 'widespread falsification' of the data entered into the program, Bharara charged.

Loan 
processors were given little guidance, the suit said: Checklists for 
making sure that loans were compliant - for example, assessing whether 
the income level that a borrower listed was reasonable - were 
eliminated. Bonuses were based solely on how many loans an employee 
could process, not the quality.

The 
lawsuit said that Countrywide executives were aware of the dangerous 
path they were treading. For example, a quality review in January 2008 
showed that 57 percent of Hustle loans went into default.

Instead of
notifying Fannie and Freddie, Countrywide instead set about concealing 
the quality of the loans it was selling them, the suit said. It said 
Countrywide even offered a bonus to quality-control workers who could 'rebut' the default rates that the review had found.

Bank of America bought Countrywide Financial in July 2008

The 
lawsuit didn’t give specifics, but it accused Countrywide, and later 
Bank of America, of selling 'thousands' of Hustle loans to Fannie and 
Freddie. Bank of America bought Countrywide in July 2008.

Fannie and
Freddie buy mortgage loans from banks, package them into securities and
sell them to investors. The idea is to free up banks to make more 
loans. If a loan defaults, Fannie and Freddie guarantee payments to the 
investors.

According 
to the lawsuit, Fannie and Freddie don’t review the loans before they 
purchase them. Instead, they rely on banks’ statements that the loans 
meet certain qualifications.

Bharara
said the lawsuit was the first civil fraud suit brought by the Justice 
Department concerning loans that were later sold to Fannie and Freddie.
