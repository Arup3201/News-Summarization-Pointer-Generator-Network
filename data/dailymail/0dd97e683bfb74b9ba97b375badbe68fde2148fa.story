The cruise ship industry might have hit rough seas this year, following a number of disasters with luxury liners, but one company is pulling out all the stops to lure customers back off dry land.

Royal Caribbean International unveiled its new Quantum class of ships today, and gimmicks to attract cruisers to the sea include sky diving and bumper cars.

It will be the first ship to offer guests a simulated sky diving experience - as well as a new thrilling capsule ride called North Star that climbs to 300 feet above sea level.

A jewel-shaped glass capsule will hold 14 people and go over the side of the ship, offering passengers unobstructed views.

Interior staterooms that don't traditionally don't have a view will have a "virtual balcony" â€” an 80-inch LED screen providing real-time views of the ocean or port.

Families will also be able to book three different types of staterooms that can connect in various layouts.

For entertainment there will be bumper cars, roller skating and a circus school with a flying trapeze.

"This new generation of ships gave us an opportunity to make another leap in vessel design.

''Innovation has always been part of our DNA and we have taken advantage of all that creativity to design Quantum cruising," Richard D. Fain, chairman and CEO, Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd. said in a statement.

The Quantum class will debut in fall 2014 with Quantum of the Seas, followed by sister ship Anthem of the Seas in spring 2015.

Quantum ships span 18 decks, encompass 167,800 gross registered tons, carry 4,180 guests at double occupancy and feature 2,090 staterooms.

The ships will initially be based out of Cape Liberty Cruise Port in Bayonne, N.J.

Potential cruise ship customers might be apprehensive about taking to the seas though after the Carnival Cruise disaster in February.

Thousands of passengers and crew had to endure five days at sea with no power and under squalid conditions while the 900-foot vessel was towed to Mobile, Alabama.

And even this month, another cruise - The Crown Princess - was forced to return to Galveston, Texas, after toilets broke down during the seven-day Caribbean cruise to Honduras, Belize and Cozumel.
