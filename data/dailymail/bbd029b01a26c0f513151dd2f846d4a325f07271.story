Cheers! Beer is the alcohol of choice for American drinkers, according to a new poll (file photo)

Beer is a firm fixture in many of America's favourite pastimes; from enjoying a cold one at a barbecue to relaxing with a bottle in front of the baseball.

Now a new poll has confirmed that beer is the alcohol of choice for most Americans - and that two thirds of people are indulging in four alcoholic drinks every week.

A total of 66 per cent of people surveyed admitted consuming an average of 4.2 drinks a week.

The annual survey by Gallup indicated that drinking levels among Americans are remaining steady, with last year's poll indicating that 64 per cent of people in the U.S. drank an average of 4.1 alcoholic beverages per week.

Beer was revealed to be the most popular beverage, with 39 per cent of drinkers indicating that was what they drank most often.

Wine was the drink of choice for 35 per cent of people surveyed, while 22 per cent favoured liquor.

Beer was the most popular alcoholic drink among 18 to 34-year-olds and those aged between 35 and 54. Drinkers aged 55 and above lean more towards wine, the survey showed.

Drinking habits: Beer proved especially popular among drinkers in the Midwest, with wine first choice for those on the east coast

It also indicated that people in the Midwest showed the greatest preference for beer, while wine was more popular with drinkers in the east of the country.

The number of drinkers who said they indulged too often was up to 22 per cent from 17 per cent last year.

According to the findings 12 per cent of people polled reported having eight or more drinks in the week leading up to Gallup's annual consumption habits survey.

The survey polled over 1,000 adults in all 50 states.

'Drinking is commonplace in the U.S,' the report said.

'Drinkers still show a slight preference for beer, but wine is not far behind.

'With drinking comes overdrinking, and despite possible reluctance by some respondents to admit problems, one in five drinkers - representing 14 per cent of all U.S. adults - say they sometimes drink too much.
