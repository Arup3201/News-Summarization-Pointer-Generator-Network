British freeclimber James Kingston says he was arrested in Dubai after scaling the Emirati city's second-tallest skyscraper.

The Southampton-based thrillseeker, 24, told his more than 23,600 Twitter followers that he was picked up by police in the United Arab Emirates after the climb.

It is believed that he scaled The Princess Tower, a 101-storey residential building in Dubai's Marina district. 'Just been arrested for climbing Dubai's second tallest building. Lets hope they let me go haha,' he tweeted.

Despite Twitter contacts raising fears that he could be in for some Emirati-style fierce punishment, Mr Kingston's detention did not last long.

A short while after spreading news of his arrest he tweeted, 'I'm free!!' and posted a link to an Instagram photo taken high above Dubai's city streets.

He added in a Facebook post: ' I was eventually released without charge & have loads of footage/photos of the climb. This [referring to the above picture] was the moment I arrived at the top floor of the building after a long climb. 1400ft (425m) above Dubai ... my highest climb yet.

Mr Kingston's Instagram account shows he's spent the past five days on a climbing tour of Dubai, a wealthy metropolis with more completed or topped-out skyscrapers higher than 2/3 km, 1/3 km, or 1/4 km than any other city.

Its towers include the 2,722ft (829.8m) Burj Khalifa, by far the world's tallest building.

At least one Twitter follower asked Mr Kingston why he hadn't yet taken on that tower, which is by now the world's most-famous skyscraper.

'The Burj is not so simple,' was the freeclimber's cryptic response, although he has previously said the tower is on his list of must-climbs.

Mr Kingston shot to fame last year when a video of him hanging one-handed from a crane in Cambridge went viral on the Internet. Now his YouTube channel boasts nearly 83,000 subscribers and his Facebook page almost 100,000 likes from people eager to watch his next death-defying stunts.

Mr Kingston took up the sport of parkour in which buildings, street furniture and other structures are used as a platform for spectacular acrobatic stunts - as a teenager.

He has previously said how the acrobatics he achieves on his climbs are more feats of mental control than physical strength.

‘To get control of the situation, mainly I’m telling myself I shouldn’t be scared, ‘cause it’s such a simple thing,' he told ITV programme This Morning in June.

‘Physically it’s nothing special. Mentally, it’s up here. It’s about 70 per cent mental, 30 per cent physical.’
