Banned: John Alexander Reid, 24, parked his work van in the fast lane of a motorway so that he could have a nap while twice over the drink drive limit

A drink driver who parked his work van in the fast lane of a motorway to have a nap has been banned from the road for 18 months.

John Alexander Reid, 24, was found slumped behind the wheel of his white Renault Tripper van with the engine and lights switched off - while twice over the drink-drive limit.

The travelling handyman, of Alloa, Scotland, became tired on the journey south to Harrogate in North Yorkshire so he decided to stop in the third lane of the A1 for a sleep.

When breathalysed, he recorded a reading of 60 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millitres of breath - with 35 being the maximum permitted. 

The father-of-one pleaded guilty to driving while over the legal limit and was fined £120 and ordered to pay £85 costs and a £20 surcharge.

Prosecutor Hilary Reece told the court that at 4.12am on January 28 police received a 999 call reporting a stationary vehicle in lane three of the A1 southbound At Baldersby.

'When officers attended they found the defendant asleep in the drivers seat and the engine and lights were switched off,' said Mrs Reece.

'Eventually they managed to rouse him.'

'Highway traffic officers assisted and carried out a rolling roadblock so that the van could be removed safely from lane three to the hard shoulder. When interviewed Reid made no comment.

'This was clearly a dangerous and serious incidents with him parking is motor-vehicle on the outside carriageway.'

Reid, who has a wife and 18-month-old child, had three points on his licence already for speeding, Northallerton Magistrates’ Court heard.

Mitigating Zoe Passfield said: 'Clearly Mr Reid accepts he found himself in what could have been a very dangerous situation in the outside lane of the A1.

'Fortunately, no damage was caused to Mr Reid or or any other vehicle.'

The court heard how Reid had been staying in Newcastle with his wife and family at the time - but after having a row with his partner he decided to get a lift with his cousin to Harrogate.

On the journey his cousin left him and Reid opted to continue the drive alone despite being drunk.

He is  a handyman from the travelling community and claimed losing his licence will make it hard to move his caravan and find work.

After being sentenced, he said to the bench: 'I apologise. It won't happen again.'

A spokesman for North Yorkshire Police said: 'It is extremely fortunate that no one was killed or injured because of Reid's actions in the early hours of 28 January.

'This is another shocking example of how drinking can affect your judgement behind the wheel.

'The consequences of leaving a vehicle in lane three of a motorway, during hours of darkness, could have been utterly devastating.'
