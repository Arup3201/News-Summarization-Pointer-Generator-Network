A group of university students have been branded 'shameful' and 'insensitive' after they 'blacked themselves up' to look like the cast of cult movie Cool Runnings.

The four young men smeared black paint all over their faces and bodies - and one of them wore a dreadlock wig.

A picture of the group, posted on one student's Facebook page, shows the four posing proudly with a homemade bobsled which is made out of cardboard boxes.Do you know who the group are? Email editorial@mailonline.co.uk

'Blacking up' row: These York University students covered their bodies in black paint as they dressed up as the cast from Cool Runnings

The group - who include one Old Etonian - have been warned they could face disciplinary action by their university.

In the popular 90s movie Cool Runnings, John Candy 
turns a team of failed Jamaican athletes into a bobsleigh team for the 
1988 Winter Olympics in Canada.

Union president Kallum Taylor said: 'I can't see how any one studying here would think this ridiculous behaviour is anywhere near appropriate in any context.'

One second-year politics student added that the students' behaviour was 'absolutely shameful'.

'I can't believe someone who's meant to be intelligent would think this is an acceptable thing to do,' he said.

University officials are also investigating claims students at the same college trashed their accommodation during a drunken rampage causing Â£2,000 worth of damage, the student paper York Vision reported.

One student walking on 
campus said he had heard the story and thought the student paper had 
been wrong to mention that some of the people involved were from public 
school.

'If they had come from a state school and blacked up would it have made any difference?' he added.

Anger: The students have been branded 'incredibly insensitive and arrogant' for dressing up as members of the Jamaican bobsled team, as depicted in the cult film Cool Runnings

The picture emerged today after a group of Edinburgh University law students' blacked up to look like Somali pirates.

Sairish Tahir and Isabelle Scott, York University's black, minority and ethnic officers, said: 'This is an incredibly insensitive and arrogant decision made by a group of supposed young adults who thought that "blacking up" and appropriating one's race would be a great joke.

'Blacking up is steeped in a history of discrimination, degradation and bigotry.

'Choosing to perpetuate these racial stereotypes to create shock value seems to be an increasing common theme across young people at universities and will certainly not be tolerated as acceptable behaviour, in this day and age.'

A University of York spokesman said the incident was 'regrettable' and added that they may take disciplinary action.

He
 said: 'This was a regrettable series of incidents which fell below the 
levels of behaviour and respect for others that we encourage in our 
students.

'The matter is 
still under investigation and we reserve the right to take disciplinary 
action if University regulations have been broken.'
