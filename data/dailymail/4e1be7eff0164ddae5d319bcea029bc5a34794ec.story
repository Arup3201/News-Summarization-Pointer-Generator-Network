Marks & Spencer posted a drop in profits for the first time in two years today after it opted not to pass on the full extent of rising costs to cash-strapped shoppers.

They reported a half-year pre-tax profit of £320.5million - down eight per cent on the previous six-month period.

Hot weather in September and 
October hampered a depressed clothing market by causing 
shoppers to postpone buying autumn and winter ranges.

Fall: M&S announced profits were down eight per cent at £320.5million as its half-year results were published today

The store has launched a 
high-profile tie up with X-Factor in recent weeks as it tries to 
tempt consumers to part with their money in the run-up to Christmas.

M&S shares opened up four per cent because the results were in line with forecasts - and the company said the second half of its financial year was going as expected.

Chief executive Marc Bolland said it had cut prices and focused on offering better value to shoppers at a time when household finances were being squeezed.

The strategy came despite the company facing higher commodity costs, particularly in clothing.

Mr Bolland added that he remained cautious about the outlook but said the chain was 'well set up' for the Christmas period.

The 127-year-old group, seen as a high street bellwether, made £348.6million in the previous 26 week period between October last year and April.

Although profits were down for the 26 weeks to October 1 this year, it has launched more than 900 new lines and rolled out promotional offers.

The chain, which operates from 700 
stores, has been hit by the huge number of promotions on offer at both 
its supermarket and fashion rivals, which has seen its profit margins 
squeezed as it tries to compete.

It started its summer sale two weeks early this year, in line with the 
rest of the high street.

Sales in British stores fell 0.7 per cent in the last quarter, with a 2.5 per cent drop in general merchandise sales.

Christmas campaign: M&S has linked up with the X-Factor finalists for a Christmas advert which was screened for the first time last weekend

M&S recently announced a £600million revamp that it hopes will make its outlets easier to shop in and
boost sales of its own brands.

The stores will include 'shops within 
shops' for each of its brands, such as Per Una, Limited Collection and 
Autograph, with each benefiting from their own distinctive backdrops. It
comes after shoppers complained the stores were difficult to shop in.

New-look outlets include delicatessens and bakeries on site, while Mr Bolland will relaunch in France within the next few weeks.

M&S shares have fallen 18 per cent over the past six months, against an eight per cent dip for the wider FTSE 100 Index.

Cheer: M&S hopes the X-Factor tie-up will boost its figures after a dismal summer for retailers

Rising inflation has hit shoppers’ pockets, leading to a wave of dismal figures from the High Street last week.

Next said store sales were down eight per cent in the three months to the end of October on a like-for-like basis.

Even fast-growing online retailer Asos has warned that there will be heavy discounting by clothing retailers in the run-up to Christmas.

At the height of the recession two years ago M&S was forced to close 27 stores - costing 1,230 jobs - as it brought in cost-cutting measures.

Sales figures were down 7.1 per cent in the run-up to Christmas in 2008.
