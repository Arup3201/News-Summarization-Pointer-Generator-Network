Led by centre Roy Hibbert,

The upturn in Hibbert’s form was
a welcome addition for the No 1 seed in the East who had seen their all-star
score 29 points in total from the previous seven games he had played.

‘I felt that I put a lot of
pressure on myself to get going and I don't want to get into excuses,’ said
Hibbert after the match.

‘I think I was making a lot of
excuses throughout the second half of the season and the playoffs so I decided
to take it into my own hands and change it around.’

For the Wizards, centre Marcin
Gortat top scored with 21 points while Bradley Beal ended with 17.

Despite the defeat, the capital
franchise still take home-court advantage back to Washington for Games 3 and 4
at the Verizon Center.
