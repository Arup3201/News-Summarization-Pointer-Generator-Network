Last year single mother-of-two Stephanie Cocker provoked outrage when she boasted about her 'cushty' life on benefits.

The 25-year-old from Sheffield appeared on Channel 5 show Benefits Britain: Life On The Dole where she revealed her £300 a week handouts made her 'as happy as Larry'.

'From being young, I've had everything I ever wanted. If I wanted a Barbie, I'd f***ing get it. I'm not f***ing getting off of benefits. That is just as simple as that,' she said on the show in 2014.

After her story appeared on MailOnline, furious taxpayers accused her of being a 'scrounger' and making them 'look like mugs'.

Now a year on, the cameras have returned to Steph's council flat where she has defended herself against the criticism.

She remains out of work and on benefits, blaming it on the fact she has to look after her children aged two and four. 

She says on the show (broadcast this evening): 'So many people take p*** out of the system. I'm not taking the p*** I'm asking for this help because I don't work.' 

The mother-of-two says she can't get a job as she wants to see her two children grow up

She added: 'I'd rather work nine to five and get less money but I want to watch my kids grow up too. When my kids are in school I'll get a part time job.'

During the show, Steph, who left school at 14, is seen enrolling for a college course to help further her chances of eventually getting a job. 

But she doesn't end up attending because she can't get childcare. 

She explains: 'The college course I was going to got all f***ed up as I'm relying on my mum to watch the kids because it's not in nursery times. 

'I'm not going to work, come pick the kids up, go to my mum's, care for them and that's every day seven day I week, I can't do that, I'll have no life,' she said.

Tough times: Thousands people in Steph's hometown Sheffield are currently out of work and on benefits

Her hometown of Sheffield, is one of the most deprived parts of the UK, with thousands out of work and dependent on the dole.

Meanwhile in Essex, the show follows Dean Rowley, 19, who has been claiming £60 a week benefits since he left school three years ago.

He lives at home with his mother so he spends the money by buying the things he needs like headphones and mobile phone cases.

Dean said: 'Eventually I would like to get a job when I can find one. I spend most time in my bedroom, watch TV, surfing the internet, listening to music, taking selfies.'

The teenager admits he finds it hard to get out of bed and even phones his mother from his room when she's downstairs so he doesn't have to move.

However, he soon realises, 'it's not healthy for 19-year-old to sit in his bedroom all day doing nothing' when his benefits are cut off for five weeks because he fails to keep up his appointments at the job centre.
