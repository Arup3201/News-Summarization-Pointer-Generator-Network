A model who has become obsessed with Marilyn Monroe has banned herself from buying any more memorabilia related to the blonde star.

Paris McKenzie, 24, from Hammersmith, London, shares her birthday with her beloved icon, on June 1, and hopes to follow in her footsteps.

The Marilyn fanatic collected everything from bikinis to 
fridge magnets in tribute to the American icon after being inspired by 
the iconic Andy Warhol print.

Paris had to ban herself from buying any more Marilyn Monroe related things after spending £3,000

Her hoarding became so intense that Paris ended up spending £3,000 on Marilyn Monroe memorabilia.

She has now banned herself from buying any more - and asked her family to stop buying it for her, too.

She said: 'My fascination started when I saw the famous Andy Warhol print of her.

'I was hooked on Marilyn from that day on and I've collected all sorts of items since I was 13-years-old.

'I've got just about everything you can think of - pictures, clocks, bikinis, you name it, I'll have it.

'I find her absolutely fascinating and I became obsessed so I had to put myself on a ban from buying anything else.

'I must have spent thousands on the collection so far.

'I still get gifts from family members which I absolutely love but I've been running out of room for a while so I can't do it anymore.'

Paris, who works as a full-time model, described the American model, singer and actress as the 'most beautiful woman to walk on the planet'.

She said: 'I have based most of my work on Marilyn using her famous smile and poses.

'She was such a beautiful woman and I found her poses fascinating.

'Marilyn had such a womanly body and for me she is the most beautiful woman to walk on this planet.

'But as far as collecting things goes that's it for me.

'It's fun to look through all of the stuff I have but I've finally decided to call it a day otherwise I'll end up having to sleep outside.'
