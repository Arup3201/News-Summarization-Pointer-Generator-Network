For most of us, it would be flattering to be told we look years younger than our age.

But one 50-year-old found the compliment rapidly losing its appeal – as a supermarket told him he looked far too fresh-faced to be served alcohol.

Father-of-three Charles Brown, whose eldest daughter is now 30,  had popped into Morrisons on his way home. As his groceries rolled through the checkout, the female cashier noticed a bottle of Grant’s whisky and asked him for proof of identity to show he was old enough to buy the drink.

Father-of-three Charles Brown was asked for ID when he went into a supermarket to buy a bottle of whisky

Mr Brown initially thought she was joking, but soon changed his mind when she called her manager.

The
 forklift truck driver, who lives in Huddersfield, eventually managed to
 convince the store to let him leave with the whisky.

He
 said: ‘I’m 50 and I can take this as a compliment but it has gone  too 
far. I don’t look 24. I’ve got a  daughter at 30, a son at 28 and my 
youngest is 17.’

Morrison's has a policy of challenging customers to prove they are over the age of 25 before they are allowed to buy alcohol

'Fair
 enough I’m slim built, I’m tallish and the way I dress is quite casual,
 a younger person’s trend sort of thing, but that shouldn’t put me at 
the age of 24.'

Mr Brown, whose oldest child is 30, thought the cashier was joking but when he told her his age she still was not convinced

Mr Brown, from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, said people normally guess he is 15 years younger than his real age.

He
 said: 'My dad didn’t look his age and my mum died relatively young and 
out of my six siblings I am the oldest, but I’ve been told I look the 
youngest.

'Once I went out and somebody asked my daughter if I was her boyfriend and she said "Don’t be silly - it’s my dad".

'I’ve been on holiday with my wife and other people have thought I was my wife’s toyboy.'

A Morrison’s spokesman said: 'We are required by law to police the sale of alcohol and take our responsibility very seriously.

'As part of this, we have adopted Challenge 25, a policy of asking for identification from anyone who doesn’t look over the age of 25.

'We hope Mr Brown took the request as a compliment as he must look very young for his age.'

While it is legal in the UK for anyone over 18 to purchase alcohol many retailers follow the Challenge 25 protocol.

Challenge 25 encourages anyone who is over 18 but looks under 25 to carry acceptable ID when they want to buy alcohol.

Mr Brown has three children - Natasha, 30, Ethan, 28, and Evont’e, 17. He is married to midwife Tracey.
