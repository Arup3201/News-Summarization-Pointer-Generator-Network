A New Zealand couple have been rescued from their locked car 'close to death' because they thought the remote device - which they did not have - was the only way to get out.

For close to 13 hours Mollieanne and Brian Smith sounded the Mazda 3 car horn and tried to smash the windows with a car jack as they sat trapped in the vehicle that was parked in the garage of their home In Alexandra, on the South Island.

The elderly couple had been led to believe that only the remote control would open the doors - not realising that a simple catch by the door handle would have freed them, reports Otago Daily Times.

For close on 13 hours Mollieanne and Brian smith sounded the horn and tried to smash the windows of their new Mazda 3, believing they were trapped inside

When the couple were finally freed by neighbours the following morning Mrs Smith was unconscious because they had used up all the air in the car and her husband was struggling to breathe.

She told the paper today that they had learned from emergency services that if they had spent another half an hour in the car they could have died.

They said they believed there was no way to get out if the doors were locked and they did not have the remote control device with them.

They swung a car jack against the windows, hoping to break out, without success and sounded the horn after realising they could not open the doors at seven o'clock in the evening, but no-one came to help.

It was only the following morning that neighbours found them and called for an ambulance. Mrs Smith was so ill and distressed that she spent three days in hospital.

 Mr Smith told the Otago paper that he considered himself 'very methodical' but he could not work out how to open the doors without the remote control device.

'Once I found out how simple it was to unlock it I kicked myself that I did not find the way out,' he told the Otago paper.

'I had this mind-set that I did not have the transponder (so I could not get out).'

He said the car salesperson had made it seem the car would not work without the transponder.

But he said he now knew that the manual lock was the same as the inside door handle on many other vehicles.

And he had a message for the owners of other 'keyless' cars and not just Mazdas: 'Educate yourselves on how to operate your car before using it.'

His wife said she had decided to speak out because people needed to be aware of the risks of keyless cars, particularly older people inexperienced in new technology.

Mrs Smith told the paper that she had received phone calls from about five other people reporting similar experiences with keyless cars.

But Mr Glenn Harris, Mazda New Zealand's general manager, said the report of the couple being trapped in the car in that manner was an industry first.

'It's not a design flaw with the car,' he told the paper.

'What we have said to the network is, with the new technologies, don't forget to show customers how to use them in their entirety and how to override them.

'There is always a manual process to override them.'

He added that the company 'completely empathised' with the couple and wanted to ensure what they had experienced did not happen to anyone else.
