Motorists were facing hazardous conditions on the roads this morning after a thick blanket of dense fog descended over much of Britain overnight.

Met Office forecasters issued a severe weather warning for most of England and central parts of Scotland with visibility in some areas down to a few feet.

Photographs taken on the A13 near Basildon in Essex showed how traffic ground to a halt as drivers struggled to cope with the conditions.

Other pictures showed the poor visibility in Central London this morning, with fog shrouding landmarks such as the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben.

A Met Office spokesman said: 'There is potential for fog to become more widespread overnight (Monday) and into Tuesday morning.

'Some
 places within the yellow area will not see fog, but where it forms it 
could be locally dense with visibility falling below 200 metres 
(650ft).'

He added: 'The fog may be slow to clear on Tuesday in some places, especially across the east of the warning area.'

The
 A130 was closed in both 
directions last night, after five vehicles were involved in a collision 
and two lorries jackknifed on the opposite carriageway.

Essex Police said the incident happened near 
the junction between the A130 and A127 in Rayleigh - and the road was shut just after 11pm last night.

Motorist
 Andy Totham tweeted early this morning: 'Thousands of motorists stuck 
in cars... We are trapped for the night. Crashes galore. Here until 
dawn.'

Drivers said there were also issues with fog on motorways, including the M25, M1, M4, M5 and M11.

Meanwhile, some airports urged passengers to contact their airlines as the fog could disrupt services. London City Airport said services were being delayed or cancelled 'due to low visibility'.

Disruption was also being reported at Southampton Airport, while Lands End Airport was closed.

Forecasters say that the fog will take some time to lift today. When it does in the South-East, it will be dry and bright with sunny spells. The West of the UK will be cloudy and wet as a band of slow moving rain edges east during the day, this wintry in the Scottish Highlands.

Tonight the rain, heavy in places, will continue to edge eastwards, reaching south-eastern England by dawn. Behind the rain there will be clear spells and scattered showers.

It came as it was revealed dozens of motorists who were believed to have driven carelessly and caused a 150-car pile-up in thick fog last September will be spared prosecution and sent on a driver awareness course instead.

Police said it was a 
miracle no-one died in the crash on the Sheppey Crossing in Kent, which 
closed the bridge for more than nine hours.

They added that some 
motorists were driving without due care and attention and ‘at speeds 
which prevented them being able to stop’.

But a senior officer said 
letting 32 drivers go on the course would be ‘far more beneficial’ than 
prosecuting them. Those who decline will be automatically summoned to 
court.

Eight people suffered serious injuries and 200 were treated at the scene following the pile-up.

The latest fog is more poor weather after
 weeks of violent storms and flooding caused chaos, with some areas 
having been under water for several weeks.

Watch out: The Environment Agency had 15 flood warnings and 99 less-serious flood alerts in place across England and Wales, with the majority in the South

Yesterday it emerged that 37 local authorities have indicated they need extra Government cash to cover their multi-million pound clear up costs after the Christmas and new year floods.

Communities Minister Brandon Lewis said the authorities told his department they planned to claim under the Bellwin scheme, which gives compensation to areas facing exceptional costs from flooding.

Meanwhile, the Environment Agency had 15 flood warnings and 99 less-serious flood alerts in place across England and Wales, with most in the South.

Tonight: Rain over northern and western areas at the start of the night will push east, bringing some hill snow across parts of Scotland. Rain will reach into eastern parts of the UK after midnight, with clearer conditions and showers in the west. Some mist and fog will develop in the west too.

Tomorrow: Rain across eastern areas will linger across parts of south-east England through the day. Further west, mist and fog patches may be slow to clear in valleys and other sheltered areas, but it will brighten up across most places through the day with hazy sunny spells and a few showers developing. Showery rain will move into Scotland through the afternoon and bring in thicker cloud.

Thursday: A chillier day with rain spreading in from the north-west that will bring some locally heavy outbreaks to northern and western areas, with snow expected across higher elevations in Scotland. Some sleety conditions are also expected to fall across quite widely across lower elevations through the day. It will turn drier and brighter in the west later on with just a few showers.

Friday: Any mist and low cloud across eastern areas will lift as a band of rain moves in from the west. Winds will freshen across western areas.
