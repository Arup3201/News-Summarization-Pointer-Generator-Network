Wedding guests these days go to great lengths to avoid giving the happy couple identical presents.

So imagine the surprise of Mike and Victoria Seymour when they opened  their gifts to find they had been given  27 toasters.

The models ranged from cheap £6 ones to £25 ones from big name brands.

The couple had not sent out a wedding 
list before their big day because they wanted their friends and family 
to choose their own gifts.

Mr
 Seymour, 44, and his 37-year-old wife were married in Mexico in October
 but held a reception for 80 guests near their Nottingham home two weeks
 ago.

'We deliberately didn't send out a 
wedding list,' they said. 'We didn't want presents. We've lived together
 for seven years and have everything we need.

'When some friends insisted, we said 
perhaps they could get us vouchers. But then we made the mistake of 
saying, off hand: "We don't need anything more... especially not a 
toaster"'.

The groom, a 
sales manager for a photocopying firm, said: ‘We did notice that the 
presents all looked similar shapes – they were all rectangular and 
around the same size – but we didn’t really think anything of it.’

They then learned they were the victims of a prank organised by best man Rob Kanok, 40.

Mrs
 Seymour, a nurse, said: ‘The first we knew what was really happening 
was when Rob got up and said, “Please raise your glasses for a toaster 
to the happy couple”.

‘We just couldn’t stop laughing as we opened them all up.’

'The fact that Rob said we should open the presents was weird in itself.

'As we started opening them it was so funny. By the time we had finished the pile was from the floor to the roof.

'They were nearly all Sainbury's and Tesco toasters so a lot of thought had been put in it.

'The gauntlet has been laid down now. I'm already thinking of something to do for my friend's wedding.'

Twenty of the toasters have now been returned and the remaining seven will be given to homeless charity Framework.
