Facebook last night announced a deal with Skype that will add live video chat to the social networking site - marking the latest step-up in the battle against Google.

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said it was an 'awesome' development for Skype as his company takes on the might of the internet search engine.

Google last week launched its Google+ service, which also has a feature that allows video calls.

The two companies are now locked in a head-to-head technological race.

'Something awesome': Mark Zuckerberg said that it's video chat service with Skype will lead the way with social networking

Until now Facebook users have been limited to instant text chat and the move to incorporate Skype takes their game to the next level.

Both companies agreed the deal to allow video chat to be integrated into the site which will mean people can have 'face-to-face' conversations with just one click of the button.

Mr Zuckerberg also revealed that one in 
every nine people in the world now has a Facebook account, while its 
number of users has shot up to 750million.

Google+, which launched on June 28, includes video conferencing for up to 10 people on its application called Hangouts.

The new service is currently open to people on an 'invitation only' basis whereas anybody can have a Facebook account and the latest move by the site could hamper the success of Google+.

Skype boss Tony Bates said that seeing the product used in Facebook was 'really gratifying'.

Rumours of the deal began with invitations for the event, which featured the picture of a face inside a speech bubble.

The
 move could dramatically increase the use of Skype, which currently has 
170 million active users compared to Facebook’s 750 million.

Skype on Facebook chat is very easy to use - particularly if you are already adept at speaking to people through the instant messaging service.

Before getting started you will have to go to facebook.com/videocalling and click the application to allow video calling.

Users then open the chat box with the person the wish to speak and then click on a small 'video' icon at the top of the chat box next to the 'settings' icon.

That then opens up a screen which sends a message saying that someone is trying to call and gives the person at the other end of the line the option of accepting or declining the call.

Friends can then chat to one another, just like on Skype, but without any need for email addresses or passwords to be entered.

The
 partnership would bring Facebook closer to Microsoft, which is one of 
its shareholders after investing $240m in the company in 2007 and bought Skype for $8.5 billion in May.

Mr
 Zuckerberg said during a visit to Facebook's Seattle office last week that the company had an imminent launch, but revealed scant 
details.

He said the project had been developed at the 40-person Seattle office, Facebook's only major engineering centre outside of its Palo Alto, California headquarters.

Philip Su, a Facebook engineer who developed the capability for Skype video calls on the site, told PCMag.com that people who frequently use instant text chat will get prompts to try out video calling.

He also said that there are new features in the pipeline but exactly what they are has not yet been decided.

Calls to other Skype users will be free, as is currently the case, but there could be a revenue opportunity through charging for calls to landlines and mobile phones.

This is a service that is currently available on Skype but whether users of the site would have to buy Facebook credits is currently being explored.

Scott Miller, Skype's director of global business development, said that a 'high priority' was to add Skype to Facebook's mobile Apps but there is no time scale for this to happen.

There has been speculation in technology blogs in recent weeks about various mobile products in development at Facebook, including the release of a long-awaited Facebook app for Apple's iPad and a specialised app for photo-sharing on the iPhone.

Facebook's Seattle office has made a 
mark on the company's mobile efforts, playing a central role in the 
development of Facebook's unified mobile site, unveiled in March.

Facebook,
 the world's largest Internet social network with more than 500 million 
users, is increasingly challenging established online companies like 
Google and Yahoo for consumers' time online and for advertising dollars.

According to the company, people that use Facebook on mobile devices are twice as active on the service than users on PCs.

'A
 trend is mobile… which means that instead of being just on a computer 
when you're at a computer, you're at a computer all the time,' said Mr 
Zuckerberg.

'It means you can share more stuff and then the final thing is that people's attitude towards sharing in society is changing.

'If you look back 30 years, I think people's attitude towards wanting to put something out there would've been different than it is today, where now every high school student, college student has the opportunity to have a blog, or a Facebook account, or a Twitter account, and can use those things to share things and that's much more of the norm now.

'I think instead of just primarily being afraid of the impact of that, now people are now primarily starting to see that that actually can be very valuable.'
