A tiny puppy who was found covered in 2kg of matted, petrol-coated fur after being abandoned has found a loving new home.

Bentley, a white Shih Tzu, was so timid when first taken into vets' care he flinched whenever a human tried to touch him.

A team of vets spent five hours shaving off the thick matted fur from his coat after he was dumped at the West Yorkshire Dog Rescue by an owner who 'couldn't bear to touch him.'

Bentle was found covered in 2kg of matted, petrol-coated fur after being heartlessly abandoned by his former owner

But the neglected pet surprised rescue centre staff after a new family were able to turn him from terrified terrier to a bouncy fun-loving puppy.

It was love at first sight for Matthew and Catherine Stroh, from Skipton, North Yorkshire who have now taken Bentley home - weeks before rescue centre staff believed the dog would be re-homed.

Rescuer Kathy Trout said: 'He was flinching from the human hand - he suddenly seems to have brought himself round into trusting people again.

The Shih Tzu is completely unrecognisable after vets shaved off his matted fur and his found happiness with a new family

Bentley has been rehomed after being abandoned and covered in 2kg of petrol covered matted fur, by the Stroh family from Long Preston, North Yorkshire: (L-R) Harvey (13) -  mother Catherine - father Matt and  Oliver, 10 with their other little dogs  Dexter (Lhasa Apso) and Daisy (Cavapoo)

Vets had to sedate the dog to be able to shave off the mass of smelly, petrol-coated fur he arrived with

'The surprising thing is that Bentley was so incredibly affectionate with the family, especially Matthew. When I took him on a few weeks ago he was so frightened and biting me - it was fear aggression.

The neglected dog, pictured with Catherine Stroh, has been given a new lease of life with his new family

'But he seems to adore these people and their children. He's gone from a mess of a dog and a shell of himself to a really confident, bouncy thing.'

Accountant Matthew, 43, said Bentley settled right in with the family and even sits at the front window waiting to welcome new people to the house.

'He's a little daddy's boy. He seemed to take to us straight away. He was all over me.

'I'm thrilled we could give him a new home, especially after what he had been through. He's very happy a settled with us.

'He still seems very puppy like. The children love playing ball with him - he just wants attention and to be loved.'

Matthew and wife Catherine, 45, have sons Harvey, 13, and 10-year-old Oliver, as well as three-year-old Lhasa Apso Dexter and Cavapoo Daisy, also three. 

Matthew added: 'He even sits at the window waiting for people to come to the door.

'He's come so far out of his shell - he's nothing like the dog in those horrible pictures of him all matted and covered in petrol.'

Vets had spent hours shaving off the matted, petrol-coated fur when Bentley first arrived to the rescue centre. He then had to be sedated to allow them to put a jacket over his tiny body to keep him warm.

Bentley the Shih Tzu arrived at a dog rescue centre in Meltham, West Yorkshire, with fur so matted vets spent five hours shaving two kilograms of it off

Bentley's condition was so dire when he arrived at the centre, owner Kathy Trout was reduced to tears

Rescuer Kathy Trout said she had been reduced to tears by his condition. 

'His coat was so covered in petrol, she said, a drink of water may have poisoned him if any fur had got in his mouth,' she said.

'He came into our rescue from a member of the public. His fur was very, very long and matted like felt and all his legs were like tree trunks with chemical smelling fur.

'It looked like he was thick with oil, fuel or petrol. He really, really stank.

When Bentley arrived at the centre, his previous owner could not touch him, said Mrs Trout. Petrol and oil that was staining his coat meant the dog, who had never been groomed, gave off a strong stench

After spending time recovering at the centre, Bentley has overcome his fear of interaction with humans, and plays happily with the other dogs in its care

'Cases like this keep me awake at night and in tears - we are not trained to handle the emotional strain of taking in rescue dogs.' 

His owner, who arrived in a 'shiny 4x4' could not even bear to pick him up, she added. 

'She handed him over on a lead because she wouldn't even touch him. It is clear he has never been groomed.'

'It's wonderful to see him so happy again,' she added. 

The dog would not allow any carers to remove a fleece jacket for weeks after they had put it on to keep him warm

Bentley has now fully recovered thanks to his loving new owner Catherine Stroh and her family, from North Yorkshire

Kathy Trout said caring for abandoned and abused dogs was a difficult job for which nothing can prepare you
