Perhaps when Wayne Rooney leads Manchester United on to the pitch, it will all begin to sink in for Cambridge United and their manager Richard Money.

The club’s cycle of gloom ended last year with a return to the Football League and since the FA Cup fourth round draw paired them with United, this tie has been transformed into a celebration of their survival against the odds.

Here is the happy ending: a windfall of £250,000 from the Football Association and a couple of hours on prime-time BBC as reward for those responsible for keeping the club alive when fate conspired against them.

While United's expected line-up cost £235.5m to assemble, Cambridge were put together for nothing

It is an uplifting reminder of the power of the FA Cup.

But Money and his players insist this is not the end. They will pour everything they have into trying to beat United or (even better from a financial perspective) take them back to Old Trafford for a replay.

Money has already warned his players that shirts swapped with United’s megastars after tonight’s game must be replaced at their own cost. 

A shirt-swap souvenir with Rooney and Co will cost £39.99 at the club shop — unless they can persuade chairman Dave Doggett to dip into the cash the League Two club will earn from the game.

Even if Cambridge are beaten, Friday night's match still represents a triumph for individuals who have made sacrifices during nine years outside the Football League — among them Colin Proctor, a director on behalf of the supporters’ trust Cambridge Fans United, who also draws footballers and sells his sketches to support the club’s youth system.

It won't be the most comfortable of nights for Manchester United's substitutes 

It is a hobby which delivered a distant connection to Rooney, via David Moyes, the former United boss who played 86 times for Cambridge from 1983-85.

Proctor stayed in touch with Moyes and the pair were in conversation when then Everton boss mentioned an exciting teenage prospect about to break through at Goodison Park.

‘He said he’d earn the club £2million,’ said Proctor, who sketched the young Rooney from a photograph. He posted the drawing to Moyes who got the youngster to sign it and send it back.

Proctor is now in possession of a very early Rooney autograph — a spiky scribble in Biro beside a pencil sketch of Rooney in Everton blue — and he will go in pursuit of an updated version for a new caricature.

No one can begrudge a souvenir for the 76-year-old who sold his lifelong collection of Cambridge memorabilia, dating back to 1947, for £10,000 — less than a third of its estimated value — to save the club when they were in administration and facing a winding-up order.

When they slid into the Conference in 2005 and lost their funding for the youth system, Proctor started to donate any money raised from his drawings to the club’s academy.

Wealthy directors like Doggett and his predecessor Paul Barry have dug into their pockets and chief executive Jez George — the club’s former manager — launched into a series of fund-raising events.

‘I did a couple of walks for our academy when we had no funding,’ said George. ‘I and the centre of excellence manager did a walk from Torquay to Cambridge when we had lost to them in the play-off final. 

'It highlighted how ludicrous it is that one football result dictates whether your academy gets funding. It’s crazy.

‘I walked round all the clubs in the Conference and then to Wembley, and that was 420 miles. Last year I did 26 marathons in 26 days to raise about £100,000 for our Trust.

Chief executive Jez George embarked on various fundraising challenges to keep Cambridge afloat

Manager Richard Money had the chance to get up close and personal with the FA Cup trophy this week

'We ran our youth programme through the Trust when we were outside the league and we had to fund it ourselves.

‘We were determined not to increase ticket prices (for the United game). We’ve charged £10 for a kid to watch. You think it is a quick win to make a lot of money on the night but in the longer term that does more harm than good. 

'Once Manchester United go out of town we’re back to League Two and valuing those supporters again, so we mustn't try to exploit the situation. We want to make sure fans come back.’

United boss Louis van Gaal is under no illusion about the test his side face, saying: ‘It is always tough because in the players’ mind it’s a weaker team.

‘On Wednesday PSV Eindhoven — the No 1 in the Dutch League — lost against the Roda JC of the second division and it can happen also in the FA Cup.

‘There are always surprises and I hope we are not the surprise. When you see Cambridge and analyse them, they play very direct with long balls. They have five or six players above 6ft 3in tall, so for us it is difficult to defend.’

For Cambridge, Friday night also represents a reminder to the city authorities — who have been resisting their quest to build a new ground — that the football club is a valuable part of the community.

‘It’s a massive game for the club,’ said centre-half Josh Coulson. ‘It’s not just the revenue but it’s Manchester United, a massive club, coming to play at Cambridge. The city’s buzzing, everyone’s been talking about it, trying to get tickets.

‘This is my club. I used to come and watch as a boy. I watched us get relegated out of the Football League so to be part of the team that got us promoted last year was a proud moment and this sort of game is a reward for the last 18 months.

‘It’s a sort of happy ending. Except this is not the ending.’
