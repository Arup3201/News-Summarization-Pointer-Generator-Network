It may only be the size of a grain of rice, but one species of beetle has managed to alter Canada’s climate.

The mountain pine beetle has increased summer temperatures in British Columbia by around 1C by destroying huge areas of forest, according to research.

By reducing the amount of water pumped into the air by vegetation, the beetle has had as big an impact on local climate as forest fires, say scientists.

The increase in temperature has resulted from the sun's energy heating up the ground surface instead of being used up evaporating water.

The change in surface energy balance could alter cloud formation and rainfall, said the researchers writing in the journal Nature Geoscience.

Over the past decade, infestation by the beetle has affected almost 20 per cent of the whole of provincial British Columbia, a region of some 105,000 square miles of pine forest.

Scientists made the link between the beetle attacks and climate after studying satellite data.

They found that throughout the affected forest, the beetle had reduced summer evapotranspiration - the movement of water from the ground to the atmosphere by plants - by 19 per cent.

Author Dr Holly Maness, from the University of California at Berkeley, US, and colleagues wrote: ‘Land cover change in the case of insect infestation is less well ordered than in other types of disturbance, because both the scale of the impacted areas and the level of mortality within affected areas are variable.

‘Future work is needed to understand the circumstances under which patchy and variable forest mortality drive significant secondary changes in regional climate.’

Mountain pine beetles destroy pine trees by laying eggs under the bark.

They also introduce a fungus into the wood that prevents the tree from repelling and killing the attacking beetle.

The fungus stops the tree from getting the water and nutrients that it needs and the tree dies within a few weeks.

Cold winters with temperatures as low as -40C can kill off beetle populations but the insects recover quickly and resume their attack.

The recent warm summers and mild winters have played a significant role in insect survival and the worsening of the problem.
