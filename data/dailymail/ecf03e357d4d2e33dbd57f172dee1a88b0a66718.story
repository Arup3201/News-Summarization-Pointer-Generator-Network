People whose blood sugar is on the high end of 'the normal range' may be at greater risk of brain shrinkage, according to new research.

The Australian-based research suggests a higher blood sugar level could lead to the kind of mental health issues that occur with aging and diseases such as dementia.

Researchers at the Australian 
National University in Canberra say this could lead to a revolution in the understanding of how blood sugar levels affect the brain, and how diabetes is defined.

The new research, published today in the
 medical journal Neurology, involved 249 people age 60 to 64, who had 
blood sugar in the 
normal range as defined by the World Health Organization.

The 
participants had brain scans at the start of the study and again an 
average of four years later.

Those with higher fasting blood sugar levels within the normal range - below 6.1 mmol/l - were more likely to have a loss of 
brain volume in the areas of the hippocampus and the amygdala, areas 
that are involved in memory and cognitive skills, than those with lower 
blood sugar levels.

After controlling for age, high blood pressure, smoking, alcohol use and
 other factors, the researchers found that blood sugar on the high end 
of normal accounted for six to 10 percent of the brain shrinkage.

Study author Nicolas Cherbuin said: 'Numerous studies have shown a 
link between type 2 diabetes and brain shrinkage and dementia, but we 
haven't known much about whether people with blood sugar on the high end
 of normal experience these same effects.'

A fasting blood sugar level of 10.0 mmol/l (180 
mg/dL) or higher is defined as diabetes and a level of 6.1 mmol/l (110 
mg/dL) is considered impaired, or prediabetes.

'These findings suggest that even for people who do not have diabetes, 
blood sugar levels could have an impact on brain health,' Cherbuin said.

'More research is needed, but these findings may lead us to re-evaluate
 the concept of normal blood sugar levels and the definition of 
diabetes.'
