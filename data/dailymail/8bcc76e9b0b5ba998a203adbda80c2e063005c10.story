As the sun beams down and the bees buzz in the bushes, Summer Pullen is happiest toddling around in her back garden just like any other curious two-year-old.

But she is banned from enjoying this simple pleasure, because of a rare form of epilepsy that means she can suffer up to 16 seizures a day.

If she has a fit at the wrong moment, she is at risk of serious injury. These pictures show her with two black eyes she suffered after collapsing at her brother's birthday party.

Risk: Summer Pullen, two, is one of only a handful of children in Britain who suffer from Dravet syndrome

Banned from playing outside: The disorder means that she is at risk of collapsing in a seizure at any moment

Danger: Summer's suffered the facial injuries pictured after she had a seizure at her brother's birthday party

Summer is one of only a handful of people in Britain to suffer from Dravet syndrome - an extreme form of epilepsy - and can collapse at any time, suffering fits that last up to four hours.

After one particularly bad seizure she even suffered a stroke. Now, after Summer hurt herself too many times, her terrified mother Cath, 25, feels she needs to ban her daughter from playing outside.

Ms Pullen, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said: 'Obviously I'm terrified she will hurt herself is she falls on the ground.

'We had a birthday part for her little brother, MacKenzie, a couple of weeks ago, and she suddenly dropped and had a seizure. She had a huge bump on her head, and two black eyes, as well as cuts all over her face.

'It's just too dangerous to let her play outside now.

'We're trying to install a soft play area in our back garden for Summer to play in, but until it's finished, I don't dare let her play outside.

'Her big brother and sister, Alex, six, and Caitlin, four, are very caring though, and make sure they play inside with her, even though they'd probably prefer to be outside in the sunshine.'

Summer first suffered a seizure when she was six months old. Ms Pullen told how she found her baby daughter fitting in her cot.

She called an ambulance, which rushed Summer to hospital - where doctors tried to discover what had caused the hour-and-a-half long fit.

It was six months before Summer was finally diagnosed with Dravets syndrome. First described by French physician Dr Charlotte Dravet in 1978, it is a disorder beginning in infancy, that is characterised by intractable seizures.

It is believed that one in every 20,000 to 40,000 children born are infected by Dravet's, but symptoms vary from one child to another and incidence may be found to be greater as it becomes better recognised.

There is no cure and it is more difficult to manage than other kinds of epilepsy. Constant care and supervision of sufferers can be emotionally draining on family, says the Dravet Foundation.

In the past year, Summer's seizures have become longer and more frequent.

Ms Pullen said: 'At first, she was only having one seizure every couple of weeks, but before long, it had become one every day.

'Then they became more frequent, and she now has up to 16 a day.

'Sometimes they're only a couple of minutes long, sometimes they can last for four hours.'

In March this year, Summer's seizures even triggered a stroke which stopped her form walking, an ability she was only able to relearn after extensive physiotherapy.

'She still lacks some movement in her left arm, but hopefully in time, she will fully recover,' said Ms Pullen.

'Doctors say they don't know whether her epilepsy will ever improve, but I just want to make sure my little girl can live as normal a life as possible.

'I'm so proud of how she copes with a very difficult condition - she's always got a smile on her face.'
