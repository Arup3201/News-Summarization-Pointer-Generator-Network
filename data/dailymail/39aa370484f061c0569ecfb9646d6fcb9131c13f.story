Support for the Greens has doubled since the Labour party set up a special unit to counter threat from the smaller party, a new poll revealed today.

A YouGov survey put the Green party on 10 per cent and Labour slumped to 30 per cent, its lowest rating with the pollster for five years.

Labour's Sadiq Khan admitted that since being put in charge of the anti-Green unit more people had begun 'flirting with the minor parties'.

A new YouGov survey puts the Greens on 10 per cent, up from 5 per cent when the Labour party set up a unit designed to tackle the threat of the minor party

The Green party has been boosted by the row in recent weeks over its exclusion by the broadcasters from the planned TV debates. 

The party boasts that its membership had reached 44,175 in England and Wales, higher than the 41,943 claimed by Ukip last week and almost level with the 44,526 issued by the Liberal Democrats in November.

While the Tories have long feared the loss of support to Ukip, the Labour party has been warned it has failed to take the threat of the Green party seriously.

In October, Labour announced it had set up a unit to tackle the threat posed by the Greens appealing to left-leaning voters.

Party sources described how Mr Khan was 'well placed to reach out to a group of voters who lie to the left of most of the public and who were alienated during the New Labour years'.

At the time the party was securing around 5 per cent in YouGov opinion polls. Today's survey puts the Greens up to 10 per cent, while Labour are down to 30 per cent, having been on 38 per cent on the start of October. 

Labour's Sadiq Khan admitted support for the Green party had risen since he was put in charge of a unit designed to stop voters switching to the minor party

Appearing on BBC Two's Daily Politics, Mr Khan said today: 'There are a number of people who are currently flirting with voting Green'

Challenged about who was responsible for ensuring Labour does not haemorrhage support to the Greens, he eventually admitted. 'I'm in charge of the Green work.'

Presenter Andrew Neil noted that since being put in charge of tackling the Green threat, support for the party had doubled.

Mr Khan conceded the work had failed so far: 'You can draw a graph, and there is a link... There are a number of people flirting with the minor parties and our job is to persuade them to vote Labour.'

Green party leader Natalie Bennett this week predicted a 'political earthquake' at the general election and said believes that the public are moving away from 'business-as-usual politics'.

Data from the 2010 general election shows the extent to which support for Labour has fallen dramatically

She said it was vital for her party to be included in any TV debates to provide balance as voters are moving away from the 'old boys' club' of Westminster.

Ms Bennett was speaking at the launch of a poster campaign aimed at the leaders of the main parties, entitled 'What are you afraid of, boys?', to challenge broadcasters to include the Greens in any televised debates between party leaders. 

A separate poll by Lord Ashcroft puts the Greens on 11 per cent. The Tories were ahead on 29 per cent and Labour on 28 per cent. Ukip was on 15 per cent, and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent.

One in five people saying they would back the Greens voted Lib Dem in 2010, precisely the people Labour needs to woo to win.
