As the live shows kicked off with a bang this week on Britain's Got Talent, the attention may have been on semi-finalists Collabro and Darcy Oake but it was hard to miss the ever-radiant Amanda Holden and Alesha Dixon.

With their perfect skin and glossy hair, the judges looked flawless on Monday and Tuesday night's shows and now FEMAIL can reveal exactly how the they achieve their on-stage glow.

Amanda may have wowed for two consecutive nights but you can be sure she didn't wake up looking that great. Her glam squad have revealed it took three hours to get the 43-year-old HD-ready.

Striking: Amanda Holden has wowed as a judge on Britain's Got Talent this week so FEMAIL sought to discover her secret

Speaking to MailOnline, Amanda's hair and make-up artist, Christian Vermaak, said: 'For the live shows we start three hours before we go on air. I have two hours with Amanda to complete her hair and make-up and then she gets dressed before she goes live to the nation.'

Christian, who has also worked with the Minogue sisters, joined Amanda's revamped glam squad this year and the pair have a great time getting ready for the show.

'It is great fun,' said Christian. 'Amanda has her Spotify playlist on the go and we soak up the atmosphere. Our dressing rooms are right next door to the studio so we can hear the audience coming in - so you can literally feel the excitement build.

'Amanda likes to be really organised and 
she is very feminine so she her dressing room smells amazing with flowers and her favourite candles. It is a joy 
to work in.'

Glow getter: Christian Vermaak explained that Amanda likes to look fresh and minimal so, on Monday night, he opted for a golden and dewy look to complement her gown

To achieve Amanda's bouncy 'do, Christian washes her hair with Philip B Oud Royal Forever Shine Shampoo. It helped to create what he desribes as a '70s brushed-out look', a very soft and feminine style to complement her beautiful white gown on Monday night's show.

To wet hair, he applied an anti-gravity product that gives body, before blow-drying and using curling tongs. It was left to cool and set before he combed it out with a paddle brush. 'I wanted to get that voluminous, soft look to offset the streamlined dress,' he said.

Speaking about Amanda's preferred look, he said: 'Overall Amanda likes to look fresh and minimal. Last night we went for a golden and dewy look, again something simple to complement the outfit, but the golden tones made sure she looked glamorous for this stage of the live shows.'

Get Amanda's radiant glow with Christian's hero product - Shiseido foundation - and Urban Decay original naked palette, plus a strip of very light and feathery eyelashes from MAC to brighten her eyes.

For Tuesday's show, Amanda wanted a really 'smooth, glossy style', so he set her hair in Cloud Nine heated rollers to add body, movement and volume. 'I wanted a hair style that was super soft to complement the flow of her dress,' he added.

For Amanda's face, he used Shisedo foundation and the HD palette to sculpt her brows.

'I wanted that Elizabeth Taylor high-glamour look so I used the Stila palette for her eyelids and Stila Major lash for her eyelases. On the cheeks I applied Mac Contour Powder, with their Strobe cream on the cheekbones.

'Amanda's lips were first lined with Urban Decay Naked 2‎ and over the top of that Naked Lovechild, that pink colour really popped against the green of her dress.

'Because Amanda's dress was low-cut last night, we used Mac Face and Body foundation on her arms and body and then Kryolan's Body Shimmer in silver so she literally dazzled on stage,' he explained.

He may have an arsenal of products on hand, but Christian maintains that Amanda doesn't need much help and he instead creates, what he likes to call, an 'enhancement of her natural look'.

'In all honesty Amanda leads such a healthy lifestyle that it shows in her skin, she has the most incredible complexion and her skin is naturally glowing - if you could bottle her "secret" then the Amanda Holden skincare range would be a best seller,' he said.

Glow-getters: Both judge's make-up artists say the ladies are lucky enough to already have great skin that only needs a little touch-up

As for Alesha Dixon, she calls on her close friend and talented make-up artist Francesca Neill, who also works with Rochelle Humes, Girls Aloud and Little Mix.

Depending on what look they're going for, it can take Alesah between 30 minutes to an hour and a half to get BGT-ready.  'There is always music playing in her dressing room', said Francesca. 'It's so much fun getting her ready. It gives us all time to catch up and have a gossip. It's actually really organised. Everything's really neat and tidy.

'We try to keep it like that but then 
in the last ten minutes when there's a mad rush there ends up being 
make-up and hair products everywhere.'

One of the main reasons that Francesca loves working with Alesha is because she's so daring with her beauty look.

She'll try anything! Francesca says the best part of working with close pal Alesha is her versatility and willingness to try out new looks

'Alesha's great because she's willing to try anything which allows me to be really creative. She's so versatile, she's a make-up artist's dream. One day it will be a natural, fresh-faced look, the next could be graphic and fierce, then soft, feminine and pretty look. There's no one set look that we go for.'

Like Amanda, Francesca says that Alesha is very lucky because she has incredible skin, which doesn't require much work.

'She's really healthy and looks after her skin and that really shows in the make-up. I enhance this by using great skincare products like Sisley face masks and moisturisers. I also use a luminous foundation on her, usually Armarni, which allows her skin to shine through and look super radiant,' she said.
