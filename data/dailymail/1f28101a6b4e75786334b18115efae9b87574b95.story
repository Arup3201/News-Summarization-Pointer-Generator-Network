A mother of six has claimed she was threatened with a criminal record for taking her children out of a school for a family holiday.

Amanda Moss, 42, of Liverpool, and her company director husband Simon, 49, wanted to take their six children on a 17-day trip to Israel for their elder son's bar mitzvah, which they'd booked soon after he was born 13 years ago.

She said that while the primary school her younger children attend agreed to let the children take nine days off school for it, staff at the high school attended by her older children warned her she could be prosecuted for aiding truancy.

Amanda and Simon Moss, of Liverpool, got into trouble when they took their six children on holiday in term-time

The Moss family, from Liverpool, went on their holiday anyway but were told they might face prosecution

Mrs Moss, a fashion designer, booked the £5,000 trip for her son, Saxon's, bar mitzvah ceremony at Jerusalem's Western Hall during term-time after discovering it would cost up to £10,000 in the school holidays.

The parents informed the teachers at King David High School by letter a month before the trip and then  flew to Israel on 17 April with their children Saxon, 13, Honey, 12, Floyd, ten, Albany, eight, Darling, five, and Ezme, 13 months.

She said: 'We didn’t ask permission, we said we are taking this time off for a very significant family occasion and the kids will be missing school on these days. 

'We booked it 13 years ago because that is what you have to do.  The primary school said it was fine but the high school didn't give us permission.

'It's a Jewish school and they said "Can't you change the date to out of term-time?"

'But you can't just change the date on something like this - people book years in advance for the ceremony at the Western Wall and travel from all over the world.'

Mrs Moss said she received a letter from the school saying their application for a holiday had been turned down, which she said left her 'really offended'.  

'It said we might be subject to fines for not complying. We were furious - we weren’t just going on a jolly to Magaluf.'

After the holiday the school wrote to them saying that staff there were within their rights to refer them to the local authority, and prosecution might follow.

'The fact that a parent faces criminal action because they want to spend time with their children on holiday for a reasonable price is disgusting,' Mrs Moss said.  'How is it justifiable?

'What the travel companies, airlines and hotels are doing is disgusting and the government is complicit - parents are now priced out of holidays so they are for the elite only.

'The government should be regulating these companies, not fining hard-working people who want to spend time with their children without it costing an arm and a leg.' 

After the Moss family complained to the Jewish Board of Deputies and to the Jewish press, the school backed down, and did not refer the Moss family to the local authority.

New legislation means that parents who do not ensure their child attends school may be referred to the education welfare officer and fined.

If fines are not paid, parents can be prosecuted, resulting in a fine of up to £2,5000 and up to three months in prison.  

A Department for Education spokesman said: 'Evidence shows allowing pupils to regularly miss school can be hugely detrimental to a child's education.

'The most recent figures show we are making progress, with 130,000 fewer pupils regularly missing school under this government.'

Brigid Smith, head teacher at King David High School, said: 'We follow the guidance from the Department for Education and the local authority.

'As such, only in the most exceptional circumstances can an absence in term-time be authorised.'
