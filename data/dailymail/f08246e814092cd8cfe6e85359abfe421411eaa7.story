The father whose child was kidnapped by his own parents 19 years ago now says that he would like to tell his son that he loves him.

The family drama is being unveiled after Michael Landers, who is now 24-years-old, was discovered to be living with his paternal grandparents in Minnesota after they kidnapped him in Indiana in 1994.

Michael Landers' biological father, Richard Landers Sr., spoke out saying that he wants to get in touch with his kidnapped son but doesn't know his phone number and cannot afford to fly to Minnesota.

Michael, who was originally named Richard Landers Jr but legally changed his name when he was 18, apparently knew that he was kidnapped by his grandmparents but believes that they were in the right and raised him well.

He now lives next door to them with his pregnant wife, and has been publicly praising his grandparents saying that while they did something that was illegal, they should not be punished because it was in his best interest.

It is unclear why Landers' biological parents would have been unfit, but his grandparents fled with the then-5-year-old boy when he was at the center of a contested custody dispute.

His grandparents fled with him during a custody dispute with his mother, Lisa Hartner in July 1994 from Wolcottville, Indiana.

Authorities reopened the case in September and using his social security number determined Landers to be the abducted Indiana child.

A Facebook post, believed to be from Michael Landers' account, has defended the grandparents who raised him.

The message to the Minneapolis television station KARE's Facebook page, said: 'For you people who jump to conclusions you should find out the whole story I was where I needed to be. My `grandparents' were in the the right I don't care what anyone else thinks.'

The grandparents were charged with misdemeanor interference with custody, which was bumped up to a felony in 1999. But the charge was dismissed in 2008 after the case went cold.

Landers' mother and stepfather were unemployed and lived in a car at the time, recalled John R. Russell, who spent several months investigating the disappearance with the LaGrange County Sheriff's Department in Indiana.

'These people (the grandparents) were nice people. It was wrong for them to do it, but I can understand why,' Russell said. 'But I also didn't think the child would be in any danger at all with them.'

An attorney for Landers' mother,  Richard Muntz, refuted claims that she was homeless at the time. He said she spent only three days living in a car and it was with Landers' biological father.

Hartner, who has mild developmental disabilities, divorced Landers' father.

His parents obtained custody after Harter moved into a group home that could not accommodate children, Muntz said.

After a while, she moved into an apartment and gained custody of her son on weekends, and she filed a petition to expand her custody rights when she remarried.

'The judge gave her custody on a trial basis, and before she could get him, that's when they left,' Muntz added.

He said the grandparents withdrew $5,000 out of a home equity line, went out for breakfast and left town.

'The trail on this case went cold the day they disappeared. There was no trace of them after they left the restaurant,' he said.

'We always just kept it in the back of
our minds that we believed we were going to see him again,' said 
Richard Landers Sr, who was speaking to KARE after hearing the news.

'Until I get to actually walk up and say hello to him again, I don't know if it's going to be real,' he added.

He has also said that he hopes to re-establish contact with his parents.
