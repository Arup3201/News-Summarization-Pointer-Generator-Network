If I’m honest, I’m rather partial to the underdog. Come FA Cup Third Round time, I can’t help myself. I’m all for the painter, decorators and bin men who take on the full-time professionals. 

What’s more, who wasn’t cheering for Rocky when he took on the might of Apollo Creed and nearly won? And lest we forget, Bruce Willis seeing off Alan Rickman and his entire gang of thieves in Nakatomi Plaza without any shoes on! 

However, when it was announced that ITV were going to be in the frame when the Premier League highlights package comes up for grabs in 2016, I found myself rooting immediately for the top dog.

Not that I have anything particularly against ITV and their Adrian Chiles-led football squad.

After all, they were considered by many to have had a more than decent World Cup. The broadcasts playing as they did to the avuncular, ‘everyman’ personality of the host.

More recently, they did a perfectly decent job of bringing England’s trip to Celtic Park to terrestrial telly. While of course they have been regularly delivering Champions League to our homes for no extra charge.

The big deal here though is that their work is done best as live coverage.

Slapped with gusto across your evening’s entertainment - 10.30pm on a Saturday night, though? Well that’s a different matter. That has become a nigh on religious experience for football fans looking to find their Saturday football in a nutshell. And that is what Match of the Day provides.

And we know this, as much as anything else, because for a few uncomfortable seasons, it didn’t. 

I’m not a U2 fan at the best of times. But I managed to build up quite the dislike for them when their ‘It’s A Beautiful Day’ welcomed us to ITV’s version of MOTD. What’s more, the programme then went on to make Des Lynam look ordinary in the process, which should practically be against the law.

Des just didn’t look right in a show that felt like it spent as much time flogging us soap powder as it did showing us the highlights. I know it’s a commercial channel, and it does that job very well. 

But come late Saturday night, those frequent two minute pauses were like little daggers to the heart.

This news has a particular piquancy in a season when Match of the Day has upped its game. Alan Hansen’s retirement rang out of the old, and the new has seen the show flourish. 

Helped, ironically, by the frequent neat reminders that it also happens to be the show’s 50th anniversary. Been there, done that. Still doing it.

It doesn’t hurt to have an ex pro with an exceptional playing career at the helm, of course. Gary Lineker may look like he’s after a job in the Musketeers during Movember, but is actually now nailed on as the best telly host in football. 

And with Alan Shearer apparently freed up since Hansen’s departure and really getting his act going with his fellow striker, you surely can’t see why you’d want that chemistry to change? 

Lineker remains the host of Match of the Day on BBC, which airs most Saturday nights at 10.30pm

Saturday provided some great examples of this. Lineker has perfected the art of knowing when to let his experts do the talking, and when to chip in.

Such as when Al was in the process of telling us Manchester City were ‘a million miles off’, and Gary chipped in quickly ‘why?’. He wanted evidence of their lack of title credentials. And Shearer provided it, with analysis that has improved dramatically from him during the last year.

He also let Shearer let rip on his fellow pundit on the night , Robbie Savage. He said he’d have been ‘disappointed’ if he’d got a red card for Claudio Yacob’s nigh on THREE footed challenge at Stamford Bridge. 

‘You’re having a laugh,’ cried an incredulous Shearer as the two went at it. As the dust settled, Gary simply observed, ‘red card all day’ and moved along.

Despite this mishap before Switzerland vs England, ITV Sport have gotten better at presenting live football

Lineker also knows when to unlace his boots, put on his slippers and just be a fan. In response to Ross Barkley’s dive at Goodison Park, he told his fellow panellists ‘footballers do themselves no favours. It’s an embarrassment’. Few at home would disagree with him.

As mentioned earlier, being a fan is where  Chiles comes in. But he is not so skilled at getting out of the way again. That simply would not wash in a highlights show at the business end of Saturday night.

I think it needs to avoid too much faff, and steer a pretty straight furrow through the highlights and talking points. That has never proved to be the ITV way.

In the end, money may talk. Which could potentially see yet another big money move for the Premier League highlights. But I personally think it’s clear where they have their natural home.

Somewhere you wouldn’t be hearing too much Bono.
