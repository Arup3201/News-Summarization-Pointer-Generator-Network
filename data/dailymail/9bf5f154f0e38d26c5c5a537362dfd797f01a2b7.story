Dancer and journalism student Anastasia Kostenko has grand plans of taking the Miss World crown back to Russia.

The 20-year-old, currently studying at the Peoples’ Friendship University in Moscow, counts aerobics, classic Russian literature and the music of The Beatles among her interests.

Practising the phrase ‘I’m from Russia’ and making sure to smile while stretching is all par for the course for this beauty pageant hopeful.

Before moving to Moscow to pursue her studies in journalism, Miss Kostenko trained as a classical ballerina. 

‘I’m a bit nervous,’ Miss Kostenko admitted to Ruptly.

‘First of all I feel proud to represent my country, and that I was entrusted with such a big event.’

‘I think I can do everything right and hope that I’ll be able to please just like victors at the [Winter] Olympic Games did.’

Practising the phrase 'I'm from Russia' and perfecting her smile are just some of the ways Miss Kostenko has been preparing

With bikini modelling serving as one of the heats, it's important she perfect her high-heel strut ahead of the heats in London

Miss Kostenko will compete among 130 other hopefuls in heats, that commence in London from November 20th.

If she impresses in the heats, that involve bikini modelling, showcasing her special talent, and athletics - she’ll have a shot at making the grand final.

But only five of the women will reach the grand final, held at the ICC Auditorium in London Docklands.
