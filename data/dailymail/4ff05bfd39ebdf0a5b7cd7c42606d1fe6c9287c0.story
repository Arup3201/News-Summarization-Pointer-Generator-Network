Zlatan Ibrahimovic appeared desperate to score another wonderstrike on Tuesday night but had to settle for a simple header during Sweden's 3-1 friendly win over Iran.

The PSG frontman, who scored an incredible overhead kick against England in 2012, attempted to score a similarly impressive acrobatic goal but was foiled twice by the Iranian defence.

However, Ibrahimovic did find the net at the Friends Arena, heading home at the back post to give Sweden the lead on 11 minutes.

Sweden's No 10 scored and made another in a slick first-half performance, where the vast majority of the 33,773 crowd at the Friends Arena were cheering for the away team.

Sweden is home to more than 60,000 people who were born in Iran, and together with their children and grandchildren they packed the stands, outnumbering the Sweden fans and creating a cascading wall of noise for much of the match.

Ibrahimovic silenced them, albeit temporarily, when he gave Sweden the lead in the 11th minute.

His clever pass found Erkan Zengin, whose chipped return was powerfully headed home by the Sweden captain at the far post, despite the best efforts of Iran goalkeeper Alireza Haghighi to keep it out.

Zlatan turned provider 10 minutes later, heading Pierre Bengtsson's cross  into the path of Marcus Berg, who swept home with a deft first-time finish.

Minutes later the huge contingent of Iranian fans roared in delight as their team reduced the deficit via a penalty, with captain Javad Nekounam thumping home the spot kick after Vahid Amiri was brought down in the box by Andreas Granqvist.

Reza Ghoochannejhad came close to equalising early in the second half, bundling the ball past goalkeeper Robin Olsen only to see it come back off the foot of the post.

Iran coach Carlos Queiroz urged his sideon from the edge of the technical area, but Ola Toivonen put an end to their hopes with a towering header from Sebastian Larsson's cross just before fulltime.
