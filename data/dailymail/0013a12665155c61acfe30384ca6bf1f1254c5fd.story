Simon Perfitt, 58, went from a £50,000 job to living on benefits after he started playing fixed odds betting terminals

A former gambling addict has revealed how he blew £200,000 in 10 years after becoming hooked on gambling machines.

Simon Perfitt, 58, went from a £50,000 job to living on benefits after he started playing fixed odds betting terminals (FOBT) - blowing up to £3,000 per day.

The businessman had led a lavish lifestyle back in 2001, enjoying well-paid jobs in e-commerce which allowed him to own a Porsche. He had also just moved in with a new girlfriend.

But Mr Perfitt, from Dudley, West Midlands lost it all after becoming addicted to playing roulette on the controversial machines, dubbed the crack cocaine of gambling and which rake in £1.5 billion-a-year in profit for bookmakers. 

Surprisingly, he didn't start betting until he was 45, but 10 years later was a broken man both financially and emotionally.

Simon said: 'These fixed odds betting terminals destroy you. I became addicted instantly after a friend who played the machines asked me to pop into a bookies one day and have a go. After that, all I thought about all day was gambling.

'I worked to go on these machines and could spend up to 12 hours a day in there. I used to get up early and go in to the bookies before I went to work, at lunchtime and would go straight into one after work.

'Within 10 years I had lost £200,000, a relationship and my home as well.

'My whole personality changed. I became very introverted, made excuses not to see family and friends.'

Mr Perfitt finally sought help after moving from Cambridge to live in Dudley in 2011 after getting in touch with the Gordon Moody Association, which helps gamblers break the habit.

He said: 'They helped me with my cognitive behaviour, helping to try and sort out my distorted thought patterns. Going there probably saved my life and I haven't gambled for three years.'

The machines, of which there are 33,000 in betting shops across the country, have been blamed for a rise in problem gambling and have also been linked to money laundering.

They account for around half of bookmakers’ profits but betting shop managers have anonymously told the Mail of the toll they take on customers and staff.

Regular players are ‘like zombies’, the managers said, giving examples of how customers could attack staff and vandalise shops when they lose money.

A recent poll found that three in four voters wanted a ban on the machines.

Mr Perfitt has now set up a charity called Rethink Gambling to raise awareness of the dangers of gambling and to campaign against the FOBT terminals.

His charity, which launches in November, will campaign for a reduction in the maximum stake on the machines, currently set at £100 every 20 seconds.

The charity is also behind UK National Gambling Addiction Awareness Week taking place between December 1 and 7.

He said 'FOBTs are so dangerous. You can lose hundreds of pounds in a matter of minutes with a few spins.

'Bookies have taken advantage of a loophole in the tax system. Bookies have been able to argue that feeding money into a FOBT is like betting on a horse race since the 'event' you are gambling on is happening on a computer server elsewhere. 

'This allows them to set a maximum stake of £100, as opposed to the £2 maximum on machines in arcades.'
