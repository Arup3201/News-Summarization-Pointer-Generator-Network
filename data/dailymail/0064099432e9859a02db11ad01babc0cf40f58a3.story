In an age where it seems every man, woman and child has an iPad, one man has struck a chord by singing about the simpler times of his childhood.

And his nostalgic lyrics about the 1980s have made his track a YouTube sensation.

Graham Wood's hit 'We didn't own an iPad' has already received more than 1.6 million views on YouTube since it went online earlier this month.

The gardener sings about the joy of using Teletext, rather than constantly tapping out text messages on a smart phone

Playstations and X-Boxes were a long way off in the 1980s, when youngsters had to be content with board games like Connect 4

Cartoons such as Top Cat were a firm favourite amongst the younger generation who adored the cheeky feline

Turn back time: This is a far cry from the slim, stylish technology that most people crave now

They don't make them like that anymore: Paper £1 notes, Teletext and Top Cat area ll things of the past, the singer laments

The song is a celebration of his and 
millions of other people's childhood memories and is a parody of the 
Billy Joel song 'We didn't start the fire'.

Graham
has changed the lyrics that now namecheck dozens of items relating to 
the 80s such as PacMan, Roland Rat, TizWaz, Connect Four, video casettes
and the Walkman.

The 39-year-old gardener
references TV programmes such as Mr Ben, Swap Shop, Grange Hill, 
Blockbusters and Knight Rider and games like Tonka trucks, Subbuteo and 
Speak and Spell.

Fashion 
trends moon boots, shell suits, and shoulder pads are mentioned along 
with iconic events including Charles and Diana's wedding and Michael 
Fish's infamous weather forecast.

The
opening verse begins with 'Timmy Mallet, Wacaday, Colin from Eastenders
gay, Shake n Vac, Crackajack, Who shot JR? PacMan, He-Man, tape 
casette, Walkman, Buckaroo, Emu, Michael Knight's car.'

It then goes into the chorus of 'We didn't own an iPad, never heard of texting only Teletexting, we didn't own an iPad, never heard of SatNavs only used AA maps'.

The video wistfully remembers long-forgotten features of the 1980s... including tasty Marathon bars before they turned into Snickers

The video flashes up images that anybody alive in the 1980s will fondly remember - from a lack of mobile phones to Shep, the beloved Blue Peter dog

The video recalls events that shocked the world - including John Lennon's death - but keeps it lighthearted with references to children's book characters

Graham, from Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, provides the vocals and he got his musical friend Andrew Barker to play his ukelele for the backing track.

As well as the YouTube views, millions of social media users have also linked to the song, which has gone viral.

The
married father-of-two came up with the idea after hearing a feature on a
radio show about a man who found a 'things to do before the age of 40' 
list from the 1980s.

Graham, who goes by hunkygraham1 on YouTube, said: 'I was listening to the radio when I came up with the idea.

'They were doing a feature of a "40 
list", a list of things the presenter wanted to do before he was 40 that
he wrote when he was a teenager and found in his parent's attic.

The height of technology: This game had children everywhere going mad to get their hands on one

This was the dreaded sight that many youngsters faced when they turned their televisions on before the programmes began

The video has struck a chord with its audience, who have reminisced about the age before mobile phones

This toy was on the wish list for many a child, who pinned their hopes on Star Wars games, rather than iPads

The video is a parody of the Billy Jole classic, and has already nocthed up millions of views

'Not long after that I heard the Billy 
Joel track which I have always liked, and before I knew it was thinking 
up a few lines to my own song.

'To be honest, I don't own an iPad and
I don't have a clue how they work, but now people are relying on them 
and other technology for entertainment.

'I
enjoyed going back to my old days and how it used to be when I was 
creating the video and whenever I came up with an idea I would tap it 
into my phone so I didn't forget.

'I spent hours poring over the images on Google but making the song and the video itself didn't take long at all.

Graham Wood's (right) nostalgic hit 'We didn't own an iPad', which he produced with friend Andrew Barker (left) has already received more than 1.6 million views on YouTube and is a parody of the Billy Joel song 'We didn't start the fire'

'When I uploaded it to YouTube I didn't expect it to get so many views, I was hoping it might get 1,000 or so.

'I put it on Facebook and thanks to 
all of my friends who started sharing it, more and more people watched 
it, and it went a bit crazy. It's incredible really.'

Graham has now signed up with Viral Spiral, a London-based company which specialises in helping viral video owners.

Damian Collier, founder of Viral Spiral, said: 'Once you pass one million hits that is a sign of considerable success from a viral video perspective.

'It is being shared on websites such as Facebook as well so it is really taking off.

'The song is perfect for record labels and there will be a few companies keen on it.

'It is a great tune and very nostalgic. I can understand why it has become so popular.'
