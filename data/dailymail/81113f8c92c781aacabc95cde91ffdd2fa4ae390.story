Scientists have mapped the quietest places in America, as well as some of the noisiest.

Researchers from the National Park Service collected more than 1.5million hours of acoustical monitoring data from around the country and found that the quietest areas were in national parks.

The team found sound levels that are as quiet as before European colonization in some wild places of the country, according to Science. 

Scientists from the National Park Service used a computer program to map the noise levels throughout the entire country. This map shows the combined decibel levels from both natural and human-made noise, which ranged from below 30 decibels to above 60

National parks, such as Yellowstone in Wyoming, Idaho and Montana, were the quietest places in the entire country, with low levels of human noise

While the most peaceful places saw less than 20 decibels of background noise on a typical summer day, places such as New York City can average up to 60 decibels.

The map shows a stark difference between the noisy eastern half of the country and the West, where large swaths of land see measurements below 30 decibels.

Noise is measured logarithmically in decibels, with a jet engine  around 100 decibels, an office environment measured at about 60 and a whisper at 20.

The quietest places in the US are found at the Rockies and westward, with secluded areas such as Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming and Great Sand Dunes National Park in Colorado leading the way.

Haleakalā National Park in Hawaii was also among the quietest, lead author Dr Daniel Mennitt told Daily Mail Online.

Urban environments and towns along the interstate system got the noisiest ratings, according to maps from a study by  Dr Mennitt, Dr Ken Fristrup and Dr Lisa Nelson.

Researchers have previously pointed out how long-term exposure to loud background noise can cause health problems.

Dr Fristrup has said that constant noise may be creating a 'deaf generation' that is unable to use our bodies' ability to hear sounds far away. 

The researchers also made a map of the country's noise if humans were taken out of the equation (above). Large amounts of natural noise, which was mapped on a smaller scale than the total noise, was found in areas with rivers and insects, such as the Southeast

The naturally noisiest parts of the country include the area around the Mississippi River (pictured) while naturally quiet places were generally high,dry shrubland

However, the difference between the bustling East and the more peaceful West was not only limited to areas with large amounts of human development.

A map of sounds created by natural sources, where scientists redid the map as if there were no people, also shows a country split in half.

Warm areas in the Southeast and interior Midwest saw high values and appear in yellow, though the scale for the amount of noise is smaller than for when human sounds are included.

Non-human noise came mostly from running water, rain and 'wind-induced vegetation sounds'. 

The wetlands and area around the Mississippi River also support a huge amount of wildlife and the constant buzz of insects can be heard even in areas with few or no people. 

Humans' contribution to the noise levels were mapped by subtracting the natural levels from the soundscape (seen above). Even areas without large human populations saw man-made noise from roads and airplanes flying overhead

Big cities such as New York (pictured) can see background noise levels as high as 60 decibels, roughly the same as an office environment or a conversation in a restaurant

The quietest places in terms of natural sounds were high, dry shrubland and barren, flat terrain'. 

Dr Mennitt and his team then measured the affect that humans have on the soundscape by finding the difference between the total noise and natural noise levels.

Even remote spots saw some man-made noise, with the rumble of aircraft overheard destroying the natural stillness.

Other patches of would-be quiet were also broken up by roads or other transportation networks. 

One aircraft can be heard 25 miles from from its path and cars can be heard six miles from the road, the study said.  

The largest areas without large amounts of unnatural noise were the Adirondacks in northern New York state and parts of the Rocky Mountains.

Half of 'low impact' areas were in protected lands.

The scientists were unable to collect data from every point in the entire country, and used Random Forest, a 'tree-based machine learning algorithm' to create their maps.

Though the researchers originally began looking just at the country's national parks, their more recent research has included data from urban areas and airports. 

The noise study's combined map bears a striking resemblance to NASA's map of nighttime light, with much of the activity clustered around humans in big cities
