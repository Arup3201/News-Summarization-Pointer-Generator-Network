Southampton captain Adam Lallana has admitted he has aspirations to play at the highest level amid interest from Liverpool.

The England international has been in fine form this season, scoring nine times in an exciting Saints team.

Premier League title challengers Liverpool expect to seal a £20million move for Lallana as early as next week.

And Lallana says he got emotional at the club awards because of the decision he has to make.

'I'm ambitious. I want to one day play in Champions League and compete for Premier League title,' Lallana told the club's matchday programme ahead of the visit of Manchester United.

'I got emotional (at the awards) because it's a journey I couldn't have dreamed of but i'm not saying this is the end by any means.

'There are going to be some decisions to make in the summer and maybe it all hit home a little bit when I was speaking.

'Every fan would realise there is big potential in our team and we have players who can go and play at a higher level.
