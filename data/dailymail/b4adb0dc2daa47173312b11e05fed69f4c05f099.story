President Barack Obama will unveil the United States' strategy to overthrow Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria in an address to the nation on Wednesday, an interview with the president that aired on Sunday revealed.

'We are going to be able to not just blunt the momentum of 
ISIL, we are going to systematically degrade their capabilities, we're 
gonna shrink the territory that they control, and ultimately, we're gonna
 defeat them,' Obama said in an interview for NBC's Meet the Press on Saturday.

The president said he would meet with lawmakers on Tuesday to give them the opportunity to weigh in on his plans before making a formal announcement the following day.

FINALLY: President Barack Obama said in an interview with Meet the Press that aired this morning that he would reveal his strategy to take down Islamic extremists in Iraq and Syria in an address on Wednesday

In previewing his strategy to NBC, Obama acknowledged that there would be a military component to taking down the religious extremists and it would 'require some resources ... above what we are currently doing.'

But the Commander in Chief swore he was taking the country to war.

'I'm preparing the country to make sure that we deal with a threat from ISIL,' he said.

'This is not going to be an announcement on about U. S. ground troops,' he promised. 'This is not the equivalent of the Iraq war.'

'The notion that the United States should be putting boots on the ground would be a profound mistake,' Obama NBC.

The U.S. does not have the resources to 'serially occupy various countries all around the Middle East,' he said.

'And at some point we leave, and then things blow up again,' he added. 'So
 we've got to have a more sustainable strategy.

'The 
boots on the ground have to be Iraqi. And in Syria, the boots on the 
ground have to be Syrian,' he said.

The president said other countries in the Middle East, namely Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, also need to lend a helping hand in Iraq.

After speaking to other world leaders at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Summit last week, Obama said he feels confident there's a broad coalition of countries both regionally and internationally who are willing to play a role in the fight against ISIS.

Without going into detail about his own plans, Obama indicated that the U.S. would be helping Kurdish forces come up with a plan to reclaim the territory ISIS has taken over in Iraq.

'There's going to be an economic element to this. There's going to be a political element to it. There's going to be a military element to it,' Obama said of his blueprint for victory.

Fishing for additional details, Meet the Press host Chuck Todd asked the president if Americans should read anything into the date of his upcoming speech - September 10, the eve of the anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.

'We have not seen any immediate intelligence about threats to the homeland from ISIL,' Obama assured him. 'That's not what this is about.'

Obama said he just wanted to make sure Americans know the government is on top of the situation in Iraq.

'More than anything I just want the American people to understand the 
nature of the threat, and how we're gonna deal with it, and to have 
confidence that we'll be able to deal with it,' he declared.

Todd also pressed Obama during the interview on his comment earlier this year that ISIS was the equivalent of a junior varsity basketball team.

Obama denied to Todd that he ever characterized the barbaric, Islamic extremist group that way.

'I wasn't specifically referring to ISIL,' he said.

'I've said that regionally there were a whole series of organizations that were focused primarially locally, that weren't focused on the homeland,' he claimed, noting  that ISIS, also known as ISIL, was 'not yet' a threat comparable to 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden and his terrorist group Al Qaeda.

'I was very specific at that time,' Obama continued. 'What I said was not every regional terrorist organization is automatically a threat to us that would call for a major offensive.'

Obama's decision to share his grand plan to confront ISIS follows a verbal gaffe late last month at a press conference during which the president admitted he did not yet have a strategy to confront ISIS in Syria.

Since then, lawmakers from both major political parties have been pressing the president to clearly explain how he plans to decimate the violent terrorist group.
