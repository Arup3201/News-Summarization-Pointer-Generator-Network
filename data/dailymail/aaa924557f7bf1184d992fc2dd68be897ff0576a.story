A Michigan school district has withdrawn its efforts to fire a teacher over a video showing an autistic student stuck in a classroom chair and instead is suspending her for a year.

Nicole McVey reached for her cell phone 
when the 11-year-old boy, who has Asperger's syndrome, became caught 
through a chair at Oaktree Elementary School in Goodrich, Michigan.

The video was recorded in November and released to a TV station in February.

In it, the boy is shown with his head and arms stuck in an opening in the back of the chair.

Distressed: A video recorded by a teacher shows a student with Asperger's syndrome mocking a boy, 11, who had become stuck in a chair while the head teacher chimes in. They then sent the video to other staff

McVey and Principal Michael Ellis 
then taunted the fifth-grader, according to
 Patrick Greenfelder, a lawyer for the boy's family.

Ellis has since resigned, but McVey had been fighting the district's efforts to fire her.

The Goodrich Area Schools board was to meet in closed session yesterday evening to consider the settlement with McVey.

According
 to Greenfelder, McVey can be heard questioning the boy in the video 
about how he got stuck before asking: 'Do you want to get Tasered?'

The
 boy is told that a maintenance crew is on the way to help and 
Greenfelder has said Ellis is heard saying it's really 'not an emergency
 in their book'.

Hearing: The school board had voted to seek to fire McVey in February but she now just be suspended for a year without pay

McVey 
apologised to the boy's parents in a letter obtained by The Associated 
Press news agency, which is not identifying the boy or his parents.

McVey wrote that 'there are no excuses or reasons or explanations for what happened'.

'I
 made a significant mistake,' her letter goes on to say. 'You need to 
know that throughout this time my heart and my gut have told me that I 
was wrong.'

McVey has spent 14 years in the district, which is about 40 miles northwest of Detroit.

'While
 words will never be able to take away what happened, they provide the 
only means that I have to request your forgiveness for betraying your 
trusts in me, and to let you know that I am truly sorry,' her letter 
says.

'I hope that you know I am not a bad person, but one who made a very bad series of choices on that day.'

Support: Many parents at the board meeting in February said they thought McVey was a great teacher

Greenfelder said in February that the boy suffered broken blood vessels in his eyes while trying to escape from the chair.

The
 video came to light after a staff member responsible for reporting 
bullying got ahold of it and informed administrators, said Greenfelder.

After administrators saw the video, the Goodrich School Board voted to accept Ellis's resignation and seek to fire McVey by filing tenure charges.

But the decision has upset some in the Goodrich school community, and numerous parents attended a board meeting with signs in support of McVey.

'I know she is supported by the community, the other teachers, the staff, I have learned a lot from her and I support her fully,' said Leanne Ruediger, a substitute teacher whose children attend the school.

'I believe that Nicole's intentions and motivations are always in the right place.'

Scene: McVey has been suspended from Oaktree Elementary School in Goodrich, Michigan since February and will be now undergo a period of retraining before being allowed back into the classroom sometime in 2015

Another parent added: 'There's no way that Mrs McVey ever bullied any child in that class.'

They added that the word 'Taser' does not refer to a stun gun in the classroom context, but when you take two fingers and use them in a tickling motion on someone's side.

The parents of the boy said they were upset by the support she had received and said they did not like the use of the word Taser.

'Our son did nothing wrong, but yet this seems to be another case of blaming the victim,' they added.

They are considering a lawsuit.

McVey is on paid administrative leave while private tenure hearings debating her future at the school take place.
