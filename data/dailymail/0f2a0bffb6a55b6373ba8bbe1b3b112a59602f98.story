A Pennsylvania man left paralyzed from the shoulders down after his relatives tipped over a portable toilet while he was inside it has settled a lawsuit for $5 million.

Douglas Adams III was on a camping and fishing trip with two of his wife's cousins when a prank resulted in him suffering several cervical fractures that left him quadriplegic.

Mr Adams and his wife sued the toiletâ€™s manufacturer Poly-San and its installer, as well as the cousins, Gerald Grater and Barry Weller, for $5 million in Sullivan County Court of Common Pleas.

Prank: Douglas Adams was using a portable toilet similar to the ones pictured when it was tipped over

The group had been staying at a hunting lodge that didn't have a plumbed in bathroom, when the cousins decided to play a prank on Mr Adams by using a truck to block the door of the portable toilet.

The innadvertently knocked the toilet over when they banged on it and shook it, the lawsuit said.

Mr Adams landed on his neck, causing injuries that have left him paralyzed.

He was flown to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia for surgery, and spent two weeks at Magee Rehabilitation Hospital, his lawyer said in a trial memo.

The lawsuit faulted the manufacturer for not providing ground spikes with the unit, despite holes designed for that purpose on the base, and the installer for resting the unit on a hill, and propping it up with wood.

Those defendants argued that the relatives alone were responsible for his injuries, according to the Legal Intelligencer.

The lawsuit was not immediately available from the courthouse, and no further details about the case could be obtained.
