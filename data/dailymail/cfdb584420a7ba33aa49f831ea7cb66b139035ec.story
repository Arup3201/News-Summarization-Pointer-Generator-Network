Queens Park Rangers will almost certainly have to significantly increase their January transfer window wage structure to land primary target Jermain Defoe.

Sportsmail understands the Loftus Road are prepared to offer between £25-30,000 weekly wage to prospective new signings this month.

The club are only in the market for loan moves or free transfers this window as they look to cut their cloth accordingly.

QPR are interested in signing Toronto FC striker Jermain Defoe on loan until the end of the season

Defoe's (left) basic wage of £60,000-a-week is proving a problem to QPR who face FFP regulations

Furthermore, QPR are also hugely reluctant to fork out loan fees for new signings.

The restrictions place major doubt over Rangers' proposed move for Defoe.

Redknapp has openly admitted his desire to reunite himself with Defoe, who he has worked with at West Ham, Portsmouth and Tottenham, this month.

But Toronto FC would rather sell than loan the ex-England star, while they are also keen to recoup as much of £6million they spent on the striker last January.

Likewise, even if they did agree to a loan, Defoe's basic wage of £60,000-per-week means Rangers may require Toronto to fork out a percentage of the forward's wages.

The financial constraints set on the club are an attempt to ensure Rangers comply with Financial Fair Play regulations.

The club already have a breach of Football League FFP rules hanging over them.
