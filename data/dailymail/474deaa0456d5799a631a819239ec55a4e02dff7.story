The Japanese Prime Minister has apologised to a female assembly member who was told to 'hurry up and get married' during a debate on sexism.

Ayaka Shiomura, 35, was giving a speech on women in the workplace last Wednesday when she was interrupted by a slew of misoginist taunts from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).

Her opposition counterpart, Akihiro Suzuki, 51, jeered 'hurry up and get married' before shouting: 'can't you give birth?'

Outrage: Mr Suzuki has now resigned over his taunts, shouting 'hurry up and get married' and 'can't you give birth?'. His words sparked outrage across the nation, with 70,000 people petitioning for his resignation

It has come as a major embarrassment to the government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who is driving a push to get more women in work.

Yesterday, after days of denials, Mr Suzuki formally apologised and resigned from his post. Mr Abe also apologised.

Since the apology, Mr Suzuki's office has
 been pelted with eggs as he continues to face an onslaught of criticism
 on social media.

Ms Shiomura, a lawmaker in the opposing Your Party, had been asking leading Tokyo business figures about measures to help working mothers when she was heckled.

The taunts drew laughter from other members of the assembly, reports claim.

Ms Shiomura, who is not married, was seen wiping away tears as she continued with her questioning.

The incident sparked outrage, with 70,000 people singing a petition for the hecklers to be punished.

Finally, on Monday, he bowed in apology to Ms Shiomura in front of reporters.

He said: 'I did not make these remarks out of any intention to insult lawmaker Shiomura.

'I recognise that there are women who want to get married and can't, and those who want to have children and can't.

'My comments were lacking in concern towards people like that.

'I deeply apologise for and regret that a comment I made set off such a huge fuss.'

Despite accepting the apology as 'a mark of progress', Ms Shiomura said he was 'a bit too late'.

Meanwhile, many leading male politicians claim she deserved the taunts because she is still single.
