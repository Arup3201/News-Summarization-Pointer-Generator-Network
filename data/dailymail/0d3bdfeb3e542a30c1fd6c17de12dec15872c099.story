Alistair Darling skewered Alex Salmond before the live TV debate even started, by telling his rival to pretend they liked each other as the cameras rolled, it emerged today.

Mr Darling made the gibe as they shook hands at the beginning of the showdown, which saw Mr Salmond hammered over his currency plans if Scots back independence in next month's referendum.

The Better Together campaign said it was proof Mr Darling was calling the shots, as Mr Salmond was forced to desperately insist: 'It's Scotland's pound and we are keeping it.'

Mr Darling was widely regarded to have triumphed in Tuesday night's debate, repeatedly challenging his opponent over the detail of how independence would work in practice.

Microphones which were left on as the two men shook hands for the cameras before the debate picked up how Mr Darling planned to dominate the clash.

As they were applauded by the audience, he was heard to tell Mr Salmond: 'Pretend we're pleased to see each other,' The Sun reported.

One of the biggest threats to the Yes campaign has been growing doubts about the currency an independent Scotland would use.

After ditching the idea of adopting the euro, the SNP has claimed it would enter a currency union with the UK and continue to use the pound.

However the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems have all made clear they would block a deal, whoever wins the next general election.

Mr Darling hammered his rival over his plans for a currency if Scots back independence in next month's referendum

During the TV debate, Mr Darling drew huge applause when he told Mr Salmond: 'Any eight-year-old can tell you the flag of a country, the capital of a country and its currency.

'I presume the flag is the Saltire, I assume our capital will still be Edinburgh, but you can't tell us what currency we will have. What is an eight-year-old going to make of that?'

Yesterday Mr Salmond resorted to playground tactics as his currency plans for a separate Scotland fell into chaos.

Labour leader Ed Miliband today insisted he would block any currency union between an independent Scotland and the rest of the UK

He said the rest of the UK would have to accept a deal because it would be the 'sovereign will' of the people of Scotland following a Yes vote – ignoring the views of those in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

But in a speech today Labour leader Ed Miliband insisted he would veto a currency union if he becomes Prime Minister after next year's general election.

He warned the risks to the UK of sharing the pound with an independent Scotland would outweigh the benefits of cutting the UK national debt or preventing cross-border transaction costs.

Scotland's share of the UK debt would amount to about £120 billion - around £5 billion a year in repayments.

But the Scottish Government has threatened to withhold its share if the UK does not agree to share the pound.

Speaking after an address to the Scottish Chambers of Commerce in Glasgow, Mr Miliband said: 'Of course you want to avoid the transaction costs, which is one of the reasons we want the UK to stay together.

'But I'm afraid the cost of a currency union without political union, without a fiscal union, without banking union, are costs that will be too high for the UK.'

But Scottish Financial Secretary John Swinney told BBC Radio Scotland, said: 'The position will crumble after a Yes vote in the referendum because what Mr Miliband or Mr Cameron or Mr Clegg or whoever is leading the United Kingdom after the 2015 election would have to do would be they would have to say to the rest of the UK 'Look, we're going to put a barrier up for your trade with Scotland which would increase the cost for business in the rest of the UK by £500 million, we're going to undermine sterling by rejecting the contribution made by oil and gas and whisky into a sterling area, and we're also going to absolve the Scots of a GBP120 billion share of the UK debt which translates into an annual cost of GBP5 billion a year, simply because we won't agree to a currency union'.
