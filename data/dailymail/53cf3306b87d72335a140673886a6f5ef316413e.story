From soaking up some culture in Paris and Amsterdam to watching the autumn leaves change colour in New England, the Goldfinger and The Avengers star reveals her favourite destinations and most memorable holidays...

WHERE DO YOU HOLIDAY?

I adore short trips to Paris or Amsterdam where I can visit the galleries. But my favourite type of holiday is a villa with a garden and a swimming pool with my two grown-up children and grandchildren.

Culture: Blackman loves short trips to Paris or Amsterdam (pictured right) to visit the many art galleries

FAVOURITE DESTINATION?

Spain, where I have a small place. I do love sunshine. When I was married to my second husband, Maurice Kaufman, we used to cover ourselves in oil and turn over as if on a spit. Now I retire to the shade.

MOST MEMORABLE TRIP?

I made Shalako in Spain with Sean Connery as well as The Man In The Moon. I took the children to Sydney for eight months when I was appearing in Move Over Mrs Markham. For Goldfinger, made in 1964, we filmed in Kentucky and Miami as well as Pinewood.

WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO NEXT?

I'd love to be in New England when all the leaves are so colourful in the autumn.

WITH WHOM DO YOU TRAVEL?

Ideally I'd like never to travel without my children and grandchildren. For my recent birthday [Honor turned 89 last month], my son took me on a wonderful short holiday to Sussex.

HOW DO YOU PASS THE TIME AT THE AIRPORT AND ON FLIGHTS?

At the moment any spare time is spent writing my memories of being a World War II evacuaee for a forthcoming BBC TV programme.

This year marks the 50th anniversary of the release of Goldfinger, in which Honor played Pussy Galore.
