Hillary Clinton's legacy as secretary of state is thin, judging from a press conference Tuesday in which the State Department's chief spokeswoman couldn't articulate any of the future presidential candidate's achievements on the job.

She's not alone, with experts of all political stripes finding it difficult to bolster Clinton's resume as America's top diplomat.

The former secretary of state herself had trouble articulating any lasting achievements from her tenure, during an April 3 appearance at the Women of the World Summit in New York City.

State Department press secretary Jen Psaki seemed blindsided by a reporter who asked her to name a Hillary Clinton achievement that stemmed from the agency's 2010 internal review

CNN?s afternoon panel erupted in laughter at Psaki's gaffe, saying the question shouldn't have come as a surprise

State Department Press Secretary Jen Psaki was flummoxed, too, when asked about a 2010 State Department Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) that summarized then-Secretary Clinton's goals and accomplishments.

'Can you, off the top of your head, identify one tangible achievement that ... resulted from the last QDDR?' asked an Associated Press reporter during the daily briefing. 

'I am certain that those who were here at the time, who worked hard on that effort, could point out one,' Psaki replied through a forced smile.

'I’m sure there are a range of things that were put into place that I’m not even aware of,' she offered moments later.

'I won’t hold my breath,' the reporter shot back.

Video of the exchange rocketed across the Internet and quickly found its way to network television, bringing guffaws from a CNN panel

'Given Hillary Clinton’s obvious ambitions that we continually talk about, although she’s not giving us much to go off of, it should not have been a surprising question,' said Politico reporter Juana Summers, a guest appearing with chief national correspondent John King.

The question stumped Clinton herself on April 3.

'When you look at your time as Secretary
 of State, what are you most proud of?' the Women of the World Summit moderator asked. 'And what do you feel was 
unfinished, and maybe have another crack at one day?'

“Well, I really see – that was good – that’s why he wins prizes,' Clinton dissembled. 

Asked in April to name her own crowning achievement as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton talked only about the collaborative 'relay race' of setting policy

Hillary Clinton will likely be back to kissing babies on the campaign trail as she prepares to run for president in 2016 -- but she suffers from an 'achievement gap' from her time as secretary of state

'Look, I really see my role as secretary, in fact leadership in general 
in a democracy, as a relay race. When you run the best race you can run,
 you hand off the baton. Some of what hasn’t been finished may go on to 
be finished, so when President Obama asked me to be Secretary of State I
 agreed.'

She ultimately took credit for vaguely 'setting the values, setting the standards' of American global leadership.

Lanny Davis, the former Clinton White House counsel in Bill Clinton's administration, said Hillary has succeeded in becoming 'the most popular woman in the world'

'I just don’t want to lose that because we have a dysfunctional political situation in Washington. Then of course, a lot of particulars, but I am finishing my book so you’ll be able to read all about it.'

Clinton may be left with an embarrassing bit of unfinished business to explain in 2016: a whopping $6 billion in State Department funds that went missing because of improper contracting procedures.

Contract files worth $2.1 billion, according to an Inspector General report, 'could not be located at all.'

'The failure to maintain contract files adequately creates significant financial risk and demonstrates a lack of internal control over the Department’s contract actions,' the report added.

Talking heads, including some Clinton partisans, have struggled to name any of her achievements at the helm of State.

America Rising, a political action committee that is among the leaders of the pre-emptive anti-Hillary movement on the political right, assembled a list on Wednesday.

'You think Hillary has an "accomplishment problem" ahead of her book release?' the group jabbed. 'Yikes.'

The top-ten list is ripe for GOP mocking.

Lanny Davis, the White House counsel during the Bill Clinton administration, told radio host Hugh Hewitt on January 29 that the former first lady's chief accomplishment was encouraging 'goodwill around the world.'

'This is a secretary of state – is the most popular woman in the world, and restored relations with everyone,' said Davis.

Politico searched in December for insiders who would echo Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt's claim that Clinton was 'the most consequential secretary of state since Dean Acheson' in the Harry S. Truman administration.

But 'even many of her most ardent defenders recognize Hillary Clinton had no signal accomplishment at the State Department to her name,' the newspaper concluded, 'no indelible peace sealed with her handshake, no war averted, no nuclear crisis defused.'

'There are few Eric Schmidts out there still willing to make the case for her as an enormously consequential figure in the history of Foggy Bottom.'

Politico tracked down David Gordon, who was in charge of State Department policy planning in the George W. Bush administration. He said Clinton's 'great weakness was avoiding serious diplomacy.'

'It is hard to avoid the conclusion that for Clinton, the SecState role was substantially about positioning her to run for president,' Gordon told the newspaper, 'especially in terms of looking "tough" on some of the big issues: Iran sanctions, reassuring Asian allies.'

'Not taking on the big diplomatic challenges made that toughness easier to maintain even as she devoted so much of her actual time in office to "soft" issues like education, women’s empowerment, etc.'
