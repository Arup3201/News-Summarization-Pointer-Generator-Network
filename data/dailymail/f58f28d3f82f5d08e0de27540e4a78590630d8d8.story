'The tago app is currently in the beta testing phase,' the firm says.

How it works: The bracelet has a large e-ink display, and an NFC chip to allow new images to be loaded onto it. The NFC link also transmits enough power to change the display, meaning it does not need a battery.

'Here you will have access to the coolest of designs, patterns, drawings to browse and wear for a few dollars. 

'You will also be able to take pictures with your phone, upload it into the tago app to tag it on your wrist.'
