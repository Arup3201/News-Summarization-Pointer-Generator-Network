Paedophile: Rolf Harris is appealing his conviction

Disgraced entertainer Rolf Harris has begun action to appeal against his convictions for a string of indecent assaults.

A spokesman for the Judicial Office confirmed lawyers for the 84-year-old had lodged papers at the Court of Appeal this week.

The artist and musician was jailed for five years and nine months after he was convicted of 12 indecent assaults on June 30 at Southwark Crown Court.

They included one on an eight-year-old autograph hunter, two on girls in their early teens and a catalogue of abuse of his daughter’s friend over 16 years. 

The court will now consider whether to grant permission for him to continue with his appeal bid.

If he is granted permission his case will be decided by three High Court judges. 

Harris, a family favourite for decades, was finally unmasked as a predator who was fixated with under-age girls during his trial.

Jurors heard how his 16-year campaign of sex abuse against his daughter’s friend 'haunted' her and made her abandon her dreams as he continued to be adored by millions of fans worldwide.

His fall from grace saw him stripped of a Bafta fellowship and accolades in his native Australia were removed.

Now he faces losing his prestigious CBE and the performer’s multi-million pound fortune is at risk from potential compensation claims.

Harris was jailed for five years and nine months for the sex abuse, meaning that he is due to serve just under three years for the crimes, which happened between 1968 and 1986.

Earlier this week the Attorney-General’s Office confirmed that the sentence would not be referred to the Court of Appeal for being unduly lenient.

Attorney General Jeremy Wright decided not to take action despite his office receiving 150 complaints about the term, of which he will serve half in jail.

A spokesman said on Wednesday: 'The Attorney General understands that his decision not to refer the case may be a disappointment to some people.

'However, he did give extremely careful consideration to this sentence and he concluded that he could not refer it. 

'The sentencing judge was bound by the maximum sentence in force at the time of the offending.

'The judge made some of the sentences consecutive to reach the total sentence, but he could not simply add up sentences on individual counts; the overall sentence had to be just and proportionate to the overall offending.'

Prisoners can only appeal against their conviction if they claim the original trial was unjust in some way - for example, if key evidence was omitted, tainted evidence was accepted or the judge did not follow procedures which keep the proceedings fair.

A clerk at the offices of Harris' lawyers told MailOnline they would be unlikely to reveal the grounds of appeal at this stage.
