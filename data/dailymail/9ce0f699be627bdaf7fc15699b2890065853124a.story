The world's smallest girl Charlotte Garside took a massive step this month after starting her first day at primary school.

The five-year-old, who is just 68cm tall and weighs less than 9lbs, is no bigger than a newborn and smaller than her favourite teddy.

Last week, she joined kids her own age in the classroom for the first time.

Smaller than her favourite teddy: Charlotte is just 68cm tall and weighs less than 9lbs

The day marked a milestone for proud 
parents Scott Garside and Emma Newman who have battled to give their 
daughter as normal a life as possible.

Charlotte was born with a form of Primordial Dwarfism so rare doctors don't even have a name for it.

But despite being warned she could die before the age of one, Charlotte has developed into a boisterous and inquisitive girl

Emma,
 30, of Withernsea, East Yorks, said: 'Although Charlotte is a 
one-in-a-million baby with some health problems, she is not the sort of 
person who will fade into the background.

Unique: Charlotte was born with a form of Primordial Dwarfism so rare doctors don't even have a name for it

Defying the doctors: Despite being warned she could die before the age of one, Charlotte has developed into a boisterous and inquisitive girl

'She may be small but she has a massive personality and wants to do everything a normal five-year-old does.

'She
 is very inquisitive and the school have already told us she has a 
learning age of a three-year-old, which is higher than we thought.

'Of
 course, I was worried she could get hurt by the other children, but she
 has her own tutor look after her and she's not as fragile as you'd 
think.'

When she was born, Charlotte weighed less than 2lbs, measured 25cm and had to be dressed in dolls' clothes.

As well as a weakened immune system and cysts on her liver, Charlotte's mental and physical development has been delayed

Emma carried the tiny baby around in the front pocket of her hoodie and put her in nappies the size of a credit card.

Now measuring less than 70cm, she still wears clothes for newborns and is even dwarfed by the family's pet cat.

But ask sisters Chloe, 15, Sabrina, 12, or Sophie, eight, and they will tell you she makes her presence felt.

Chloe
 said: 'She might look like a doll but she's made of strong stuff. She 
loves tearing around the house and being thrown in the air.

'When people first meet her they are afraid she might break if they 
touch her - but she's quite scrappy and doesn't sit still for a second.'

As well as a weakened immune system and cysts on her liver, Charlotte's mental and physical development has been delayed.

But Scott, 26, and Emma, feel the best way to see what Charlotte is capable of is by testing her in mainstream education.

Emma
 said: 'There are a lot of unknowns but Charlotte has a way of 
surprising you when you least expect it. We didn't know if she would 
live this long.

'We didn't know if she would be able to interact with people and there have been times when we thought we might lose her.

'But she keeps on thriving and I can't wait to see what the next year brings.'
