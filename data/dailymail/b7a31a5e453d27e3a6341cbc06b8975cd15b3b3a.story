Abuse: Police said Google had tipped them off about the internet use of 41-year-old John Skillern, pictured

A convicted child abuser has been charged with fresh offences after saying Google detected indecent images in his Gmail account.

The internet giant used sophisticated scanning techology to catch John Henry Skillern, 41, as he allegedly tried to send three explicit photos of a young girl to a friend.

Skillern has now been charged with the possession and promotion of child pornography in a victory for Google's sometimes controversial e-mail scanning policies.

Police in the city of Webster near Houston, Texas, said they were tipped off by Google on July 11 and obtained a warrant to search Skillern's electronic devices.

They searched his home in Houston on July 24 and found the offending images, according to a crime report released by Webster Police. 

Detective David Nettles, from the Houston Metro Internet Crimes Against Children Taskforce, said Skillern used a Gmail account to e-mail a friend three explicit photos of a young girl.

'They got a tip from Google, basically Gmail,' he told KHOU 11 News.

'He was trying to get around getting caught with just keeping it inside of his e-mail. I would never be able to find that.'

A police statement said Skillern was held in custody after being charged.

It added: 'After forensics were completed on evidence collected at the residence, the Webster Criminal Investigation Division filed one count of possession of child pornography and one count of promotion of child pornography on Skillern through the Harris County District Attorney’s office.

'Each count had a bond of $100,000 for a total of $200,000.'

Skillern is a convicted child abuser whose name already appears for the rest of his life on the Texas Sex Offenders' Register.

He was jailed for 20 years in 1994 for an aggravated sexual assault on an eight-year-old boy, according to the online database.

Although the crackdown on child abuse images has been welcomed, Google's wider e-mail scanning technology has proved controversial and sparked a number of lawsuits.

In April it stopped scanning e-mails on Google Apps for Education, used by 30million people in the academic world, amid claims the information could be used for targeted advertising.

Since 2008 Google has used technology known as 'hashing' to tag known child sexual abuse images.

That allows copies of those images elsewhere to be detected by computer software without humans having to view them again.

Each image is encrypted, catalogued and assigned a unique ID number which is then tested against images being sent from Gmail accounts to see if they match.

More sophisticated ways of detecting abuse images are being detected all the time.

Last summer Google revealed it was launching a Child Protection Technology Fund worth $2million to encourage the development of more precise software.

And last year it was sued by a group of citizens who claimed scanning e-mails to produce advertising violated the Federal Wiretap Act.

The lawsuit was led by Keith Dunbar of Bowie County, Texas, who claimed e-mails he sent to Gmail users from a non-Google account were scanned by the firm.

His argument was that by not signing up to Gmail himself, he had never given permission for the scans to take place.

Google's terms of service clearly state that e-mails are analysed, and that any lawbreakers will be reported to the authorities.

'Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection,' the terms say. 

Information the firm gathers can be passed on for a number of reasons, including to 'protect against harm to... our users or the public as required or permitted by law'.

A blog by the firm last year added: 'The Internet has been a tremendous force for good - increasing access to information, improving people’s ability to communicate and driving economic growth. But like the physical world, there are dark corners on the web where criminal behavior exists.

Tool: Google spends millions of dollars developing ever more sophisticated tools to detect child abuse photos

'In 2011, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children’s (NCMEC’s) Cybertipline Child Victim Identification Program reviewed 17.3 million images and videos of suspected child sexual abuse.

'Behind these images are real, vulnerable kids who are sexually victimized and victimized further through the distribution of their images.

It is critical that we take action as a community - as concerned parents, guardians, teachers and companies - to help combat this problem.

'We’re in the business of making information widely available, but there’s certain “information” that should never be created or found.

'We can do a lot to ensure it’s not available online - and that when people try to share this disgusting content they are caught and prosecuted.'
