A stand-up comedian has been ordered to pay back more than £6,000 in unpaid rent at a rate of just £1 a month - which will take 546 years.

Ross Wagman was told to repay his 18-month debt along with a bill for clearing rubbish to landlord Ray Wright, 68, from Bury in Greater Manchester, after he rented an industrial unit from him.

The grandfather took his case to a small claims court and was awarded the costs, but will have to live until he is 614 to see the cash. 

Ross Wagman was given 546 years to repay his 18-month rent debts after a court ordered he could pay it back at £1 a month

Mr Wagman, who has written pilot episodes for the BBC, began monthly payments after the ruling last February but the payments came to a stop in October.

Mr Wright claims at this point he had made just five payments - of £5.

He said that he had been renting the industrial building to Mr Wagman's family for the last 30 years and considered them family friends.

The landlord explained that the Wagman's operated an auctioneer business and bought in and sold items, using the property to store them.

When Mr Wagman decided to leave the premises in February 2012 he still had outstanding debts and Mr Wright said he left the place in such a state he filled 18 skips with rubbish.

It cost him £2,000 to hire them and he had labour costs for the five people needed to do the work.

Mr Wright said: 'When the new chap opened the doors it was an absolute shambles. Bags and goods covered all 2,700 sq ft of the unit.

'It has cost me £900 in court fees alone. By the time he has paid that back at this rate of £1 a month it will be 75 years.

'It's ludicrous. What hurts the most is they were family friends and I helped them out and this is how I've been treated.'

As well as his comedic work, Mr Wagman, from Whitefield in Greater Manchester, has also been running a wholesale button and craft pack service online called Craft Parcels since 2004.

He was a Citylife Comedy Competition 2003 finalist and is known for his 'original, unique take on the world', according to entertainment listing site Ents24. 

Mr Wagman also runs a blog - The Monkeys All Say Boo - where he shares the bedtime stories he has read with his son. 

Mr Wright, who took the case back to Bury County Court last week to claim the outstanding £6,559, said: 'He's still trading. I have to do without and he gets off scot-free.

'It's been back and forth through the courts but finally a judge has cancelled the orders that had been put in place. 

'It's been a nightmare but I'm not giving up, no way.' 

MailOnline was unable to reach Mr Wagman for a comment. 

HM Courts and Tribunals Service said it could not discuss a judgement.
