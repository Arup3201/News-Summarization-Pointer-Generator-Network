Police unsuccessfully searched the loft where Tia Sharp’s body was hidden twice but only discovered her on the third attempt.

The officer in charge of the hunt today apologised for his force's incompetence and admitted that the first two searches were 'really just a look round'.

Tia’s body was found wrapped in a sheet and layers of plastic in the loft of her grandmother’s home on August 10 last year, a week after she went missing.

It was only when detectives noticed a 
smell of decomposition in the upstairs of Christine Bicknell’s house 
that Tia was finally found.

Killer: Stuart Hazell, pictured being arrested in August, hid Tia Sharp's body in the loft of his house

Hunt: Police outside the house where Tia's body was found after it had been missing for a week

A total of 80 officers were involved in the search effort, and were given access to more than 800 hours of CCTV footage.

'The early searches were really just a look round, they were not deep searches,' Detective Chief Inspector Nick Scola said outside the Old Bailey today after Stuart Hazell pleaded guilty to Tia's murder.

He apologised for not finding the 12-year-old's body earlier, but said that if she had been discovered it 'would not have made any difference' to her fate.

Hazell is due to be sentenced tomorrow, having changed his plea after months of protesting his innocence.

Searching: Officers rifled through bins outside the house where Tia's body was hidden all along

A police constable first went into the loft on August 4, climbing up on a stool balanced on a chair.

He said: 'I was searching for a missing 
girl and from what I could see the loft seemed very clear. I thought, 
"She is not hiding in here."'

The following day a specialist team came in, and one officer said he would have recognised the smell of a decomposing body if it had been apparent.

His colleague said he took about 25 minutes to search the loft, including moving around black bags which the team believed were too light to contain anything significant.

Victim: Hazell murdered Tia at his home in South London last August

Later, a search dog was brought to the 
house in New Addington, South London, and indicated that there was 
something above one of the bedrooms, but the animal was too large to 
take into the loft so the officers ignored the warning.

On August 10 a detective noticed the smell of decomposition in the house, which Ms Bicknell mistakenly thought was cat faeces.

Another dog also indicated that something might be in the loft of the house, and Tia's body was found during a more thorough search.

Detective Constable Daniel Chatfield, who found Tia’s body as he and a crime scene manager searched the loft, said: 'The loft was extremely confined, it was very hot and quite chaotic, so there were a lot of boxes and bags around the hatch entrances which needed to be moved in order to search further into the loft.

'After about 10 minutes my colleague Mr Langley had alerted me to what he believed to be the body of Tia.'

In the wake of Tia’s death, Scotland Yard apologised to her family that it had taken so long to find her.
