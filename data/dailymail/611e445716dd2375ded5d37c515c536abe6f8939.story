Morne van Wyk scored an unbeaten century to steer South Africa to a 69-run win over West Indies in the T20 international in Durban to prevent a series whitewash.

Van Wyk scored 114 not out from 70 balls, which included nine fours and seven maximums, as he steered the Proteas to an imposing total of 195 for three from their 20 overs.

It meant West Indies won the series 2-1 ahead of the first of five one-day internationals between the two sides on Friday at the same venue.

Reeze Hendricks (42) ably assisted the free-scoring Van Wyk before David Wiese (21) pitched in towards the end of the Proteas' innings.

West Indies started out brightly in their reply, but wickets fell at regular intervals after Dwayne Smith was bowled by Aaron Phangiso in the sixth over.

Wiese then put West Indies on the brink of defeat with figures of five for 23 from his four overs and they were unable to build any momentum as their run rate and wickets continued to fall.

West Indies had won the toss and chose to field and could have rued that decision early on when it took until the 13th over to claim the first South African wicket when Hendricks was caught by Dwayne Smith off the bowling of Kieron Pollard for 42.

By then, South Africa had already passed the 100 mark and the West Indies had to wait until the score was on 158 before they claimed their next wicket when Wiese was bowled by Dwayne Bravo for 21.

Rilee Roussouw was dismissed for a duck by Sheldon Cottrell the following over, with Jean-Paul Duminy (seven) joining Van Wyk for the last seven balls.

In reply, the West Indies started brightly in their bid to reach the target of 196 to win but lost their first wicket on 48 when Smith (five) was bowled by Phangiso.

Marlon Samuels (six) departed soon after, caught by Justin Ontong off the bowling of Wiese, before the right arm quick also accounted for Lendl Simmons for 49.

That left the visitors stuttering on 68 for three and needing 128 to win from 68 balls.

Following the flurry of wickets, West Indies' run rate dropped from nine an over to just over seven, and soon enough they were facing more of a struggle after Andrew Fletcher holed out at third man to give Wayne Parnell his first wicket of the match.

That brought Pollard to the crease to join Bravo, who departed for 12, with new man Andre Russell out for the same score to leave West Indies with little hope on 100 for six.

Darren Sammy (eight) and Carlos Brathwaite (one) were both dismissed by Wiese in the 17th over to leave a near impossible task of scoring 80 runs from 18 balls.

Ashley Nurse was caught by Duminy off the bowling of Marchant de Lange to leave West Indies on 125 for nine, and it was all over two balls later when Cottrell was clean bowled for a golden duck, leaving Pollard unbeaten on 20.
