A Sherlock Holmes tale by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has been uncovered for the first time in 50 years

An unknown Sherlock Holmes story written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle for a fundraising sale as been unearthed after lying in an attic for almost 50 years.

The 1,300-word tale starring the famous detective is part of a book of short stories created to help raise money to build a new bridge in the Scottish town of Selkirk after it was destroyed in 1902.

The famous author - who visited the area often - decided to help locals by contributing to the 'Book o' the Brig', which was sold at the three-day bazaar two years later. 

Walter Elliot, 80, was given the 48-page pamphlet by a friend more than 50 years ago and had forgotten about it until recently after looking in his attic. 

The two-and-a-half page story, titled 'Sherlock Homes: Discovering the Border Burghs and, by deduction, the Brig Bazaar', is about the sleuth and Watson's trip to the town.

It is believed the story - about Holmes deducing Watson is going on a trip to Selkirk - is the first unseen Holmes story by Doyle since the last was published over 80 years ago. 

He was prompted to write the tale after the town was struck by a great flood in 1902 and the town's Wood Brig crossing the Ettrick in the Scottish Borders was washed away.

The great-grandfather from Selkirk, who found the book tied together with string, said: 'In Selkirk there was a wooden bridge that was put up some time before it was flooded in 1902.

'The town didn't have the money to replace it so they decided to have a bazaar to replace the bridge in 1904.

'They had various people to come and do things and just about everyone in the town did something.

'The local MPs and landowners and everyone in two days I think took in £560, which was quite some sum then.

The 'Book o' the Brig' was given to Walter Elliott, 80, by a friend but he'd forgotten about it for half a century

'The Saturday was opened by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. He had written a wee story about Sherlock Holmes and Watson and this was in the book.

'I can't remember how much they raised but they wanted it to be a carriage bridge but they didn't get quite enough for that, but they built an iron bridge and it's still there today.

The Sherlock tale starts with a newspaper editor dispatching a journalist to London to find 'a word from Sherlock Holmes' and Watson.

The writer finds the pair and watches them in conversation - as Holmes declares he's going to Edinburgh to solve the 'mysteries of the Secret Cabinet'.

He asks Watson if he'd like to go with him but when Watson says he can't go Holmes sounds surprises and says he thought he was 'going to the Border country'.

Watson then asks him how he knows that and Holmes, using his usual powers says it is a 'matter of deduction'.

He says Watson had recently discussed politics of the north and had used a term 'huz' which is only found in a certain area of Scotland.

Holmes also says he heard Watson 'crooning a weird song' which he must have read or heard while previously in Hawick, Scotland.

He says 'later still the plot deepened' when Watson began 'lilting' another local song and then showed knowledge of James IV.

Homes says the clues means Watson must be heading to either Hawick, Galashiels, or Selkirk.

He says he then 'smoked a ton of tobacco' and spent the night in thought and worked out he was heading to Selkirk.

Watson then admits he is indeed 'going to Selkirk in aide of a Bridge' and Holmes wishes him well on his journey.

'He really must have thought enough of the town to come down and take part and contribute a story to the book. It's a great little story.' 

The book - around ten inches long and three inches wide with a soft brown paper cover - contained stories from local people, as well as the famous author.

The back cover details a programme of events and proudly states 'the famous litterateur' was due to open the day before the ladies orchestra performed and local piano recitals.

'It was a varied book with lots of bits and pieces and stories,' said Mr Elliott, a retired woodcutter and father-of-three.

'I have no idea how many they made and sold. I've had this book for about 40 or 50 years. I must have got it from a friend because I can't remember buying it from anyone.

'Usually people would throw out these books or sell them off. It has been in my family for quite a while now.

'I have no idea if it has ever been published - I've never seen it. I've always been interested in history and my family has always passed on stories and I suppose this was one of the stories that was passed down.'

Sarah Dunnigan, a senior lecturer in English Literature at University of Edinburgh, said: 'This seems like a really fun piece, it's self-parodic, makes a playful jibe against journalists, and wittily compresses Scottish Borders history in an affectionate tribute to Selkirk - all whilst leaving the reader wondering where both the story, and Watson, are heading.

'It feels like Conan Doyle really enjoyed writing it.' 

Sir Conan Doyle returned to the town a few months later with a cricket team to play Selkirk.

In 1905 he gifted a now-lost Border league football trophy, called the Conan Doyle Cup, last won by Kelso in 1937-38.

A year later, Conan Doyle stood as a Unionist candidate for Westminster in the nearby Hawick Burghs constituency.

The booklet will be on show at the Cross Keys Selkirk Pop-up Community Museum from Saturday, along with Mr Elliot's painting of the replaced bridge. 

This painting shows Bannerfield's Bridge, before it was washed away by a great flood in 1902. After the flooding, the town held a fundraising sale to build a replacement and it was here that the book was sold
