Prince Charles has come under attack again after one of Britain's leading architects claimed that he wields a veto over prominent new buildings in London.

Richard Rogers, who designed the Millennium Dome and the Pompidou Centre in Paris, described the power held by the Prince of Wales as 'an amazing situation'.

The eminent architect's claims come just a week after it emerged that Charles had seconded members of his staff to advise ministers in Government departments.

Lord Rogers told the New Yorker that he had been asked to work on a multi-million-pound development set to be built in Central London.

He said he was surprised to have been asked, as he had previously clashed with the Prince over his plans for the Chelsea Barracks site.

Charles lobbied the Emir of Qatar, who owns the site and eventually agreed to scrap Lord Rogers' £3billion plan for a modernist complex made of glass and steel.

The 80-year-old architect went on to tell the magazine that developers routinely consulted the Prince before launching major projects.

'An amazing situation!', he said. 'But they're into minimising risk - and Prince Charles is a risk.'

Lord Rogers - whose work is currently on display in an exhibition at the Royal Academy - accused Charles of acting in an 'unconstitutional' manner by consulting the Qataris in secret, saying that his alleged influence was 'an abuse of power'.

The developers who were due to carry out Lord Rogers' plans for Chelsea Barracks claimed to have lost more than £80million due to the Prince's intervention.

Charles first made his traditionalist views on architecture known in 1984, when he described a proposed new wing of the National Gallery as a 'monstrous carbuncle'.

He once criticised Lord Rogers' work in inflammatory terms, saying: 'You have to give this much to the Luftwaffe - when it knocked down our buildings, it didn't replace them with anything more offensive than rubble.'

However, Clarence House denied that the Prince was asked for his blessing by developers seeking to embark on major projects in London.

'Developers do not seek planning approval from the Prince of Wales as planning development approvals lie with local planning authorities,' a spokesman told the Independent.

'If developers choose to send the Prince of Wales information about upcoming developments that is up to them but the Prince does not, and cannot, grant planning permission.'

The spokesman added that Charles regularly receives letters from ordinary people 'complaining about developments and planning decisions' due to his well-known interest in architecture.

Developments which were scrapped after the Prince publicly opposed them include a planned skyscraper in the City and a modernist opera house in Cardiff.

However, Renzo Piano's designs for the Shard skyscraper did come to fruition despite Charles's criticisms.

Earlier this week, it emerged that Clarence House aides had been seconded to the Cabinet Office and the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

The revelations prompted claims that the Prince could be overstepping his constitutional role by intervening directly in Government decisions.
