Michael Bradley led the United States to a 2-0 victory against Panama in Los Angeles on Sunday in spectacular fashion - by scoring the opening goal directly from a corner kick.

Bradley's goal came in the 27th minute, as he looped the ball perfectly over Panama goalkeeper Jaime Penedo and perfectly into the far corner of the net.

At first, there was some minor confusion as to whether Jozy Altidore had got a touch but replays showed that the ball sailed over his head on its way into the net for Bradley's 13th international goal.

Scoring from a corner is called an 'Olimpico' goal after Cesareo Onzari scored managed the feat to win Olympic gold for Argentina against Uruguay at the 1924 games in Paris.

Jurgen Klinsmann's side doubled their lead ten minutes later through Clint Dempsey with a composed finish after some neat footwork.

Panama had little offensive luck against the United States in their first meeting since the Americans scored two stoppage-time goals to knock the Panamanians out of World Cup contention in heartbreaking fashion in October 2013. 

Panama have beaten the Americans just once in 15 meetings, losing six straight.

It was Kilnsmann's first win with the United States since they won 2-1 against Ghana in their opening group game at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.

And some United States supporters used the game to let their frustrations out at Klinsmann's achievements since the tournament last year.

There were banners in the stadium reading 'JK OUT' and 'Red Card the Coach.'

But the result comes at a good time for Klinsmann, with a big year ahead that includes the Gold Cup and World Cup qualifying.

Next up for the United States are two friendlies against Denmark and Switzerland in March.
