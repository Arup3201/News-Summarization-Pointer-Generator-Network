Wayne Hennessey has urged Neil Warnock to watch him when Wales face Belgium in Brussels as he bids to dislodge Julian Speroni as Crystal Palace No 1.

Hennessey has been limited to just 35 minutes of Premier League football this season, when Speroni was forced off with a head injury against West Bromwich Albion.

But he has starred for Wales in their promising Euro 2016 qualifying campaign, producing a man-of-the-match display against Bosnia, and wants his club manager to take a look when he comes up against Eden Hazard and Co.

‘I’d like to think he’s watching. It would be nice,’ said Hennessey. ‘It’s not going the way I’d like it to at Crystal Palace at the moment but I come away with Wales, put my head down, and am getting some game time.

‘It is difficult not playing week in week out, but I keep myself prepared in training, I play cup games.

‘I'm not guaranteed to play here (with Wales), I have to show I want to play and that I'm ready. I came away with a lot of confidence after the last two (qualifying) games.’

Wales top Group B and would take a significant step towards a first major tournament since 1958 with a positive result on Sunday evening.

‘It's up there with the biggest game of the last decade,’ said Hennessey. ‘They've got quality players but so have we so we're confident we can go and get a result.’
