It was supposed to give ITV programmes a fresh and coherent new look.

But as the broadcaster unveiled its colourful new logo yesterday, not everyone was so flattering in their assessment.

The design was immediately ridiculed by some viewers who said it reminded them of a child’s crayon drawing or even the outline of a human bottom.

Ridiculed: ITV launched a new logo for all its channels yesterday but it was likened to a child's crayon drawing by one viewers and a bottom by another

The logo is part of a multi-million pound rebrand – ITV’s biggest in 12 years – launched at 6am yesterday across all the network’s channels. 

As well as introducing a new lower case logo, designed to look like joined up handwriting, the broadcaster renamed its flagship channel. Known as ITV1 since 2001 it will now simply be called ITV.

The logo will change colour to match the tone of different programmes and channels.

ITV News has a sombre blue design, while entertainment channel ITV2 has been given a ‘hot red’ logo.

The broadcaster also introduced a series of new ‘idents’, the branded segments shown between programmes while announcers give scheduling information.

However, the new look divided opinion among viewers.

Writing on Twitter, one said: ‘The new ITV logo looks like a child practising joined up writing with crayons.’ 

Another added: ‘Hmm. New ITV logo does look a little bit like a bottom.’

A third said: ‘The new ITV logo looks like something a local charity would use after Debbie in marketing goes on a half-day photoshop course.’

Loves it: ITV's This Morning presenter Phillip Schofield is a fan of the new logo in the redesign which took over a year to plan

However, other viewers welcomed the change. One said: ‘Love the new rebranding, very fresh and modern.’ 

Unsurprisingly, ITV’s This Morning presenter Phillip Schofield was also a fan, declaring: ‘I love the new ITV logo!’

Produced by ITV’s in-house creative team, the redesign took over a year to plan.

Rufus Radcliffe, ITV’s group director of marketing and research, said: ‘Viewers now have access to hundreds of channels and are forming relationships with digital brands that did not exist a few years ago.

‘The rebranding of ITV will allow us to further cement the relationship in viewers’ minds between our shows and the ITV brand that produces and broadcasts them.

‘We now have a consistent identity across everything that we do, all rooted in our positioning as a media brand that is at the heart of popular culture.’

This is not the first time a TV rebrand has divided opinion.

In 2008, the BBC were criticised for spending £550,000 on a new logo for its news operation.

Viewers complained the swirling red globe left them feeling nauseous and dizzy.
