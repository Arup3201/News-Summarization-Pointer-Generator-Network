An Australian photographer has put this sprawling Hawaiian getaway he bought two years ago for less than US$10 million dollars  back on the market for more than double what he paid.

Peter Lik, who famously sold an x-ray image of an Arizona canyon for $8 million last year, has listed the exotic holiday home for $US19.8 million (A$25.5 million).

The 55-year-old Melbourne-born artist bought the three-bedroom, three-pavilion property in Maui from tech-industry entrepreneur Bill Nguyen in 2013.

Lik, 55, made headlines last year when he sold this black and white photo of Arizona's Antelope Canyon for $7.87 million to an unnamed buyer

Lik has spent $3 million updating the 370 square metre home, which is located within the island's Kapalua Resort. 

He bought the island property, which overlooks Mokuleia Bay and Honolua Bay, as a getaway but now has to sell due to frequent travel commitments.

It is listed for sale through Sotheby’s International Realty.

The Olson Kundig Architects-designed home features rammed earth walls, cement floors and 80 feet of steel-framed glass doors controlled by hydraulics.

The property is separated into three different pavilions, including the central living area complete with a chef's kitchen and media room.

The guest hut and master bedroom are perfectly positioned to take in the ocean views.  

There's an outdoor heated saline pool, a tanning ledge and outdoor shower, as well as various Zen gardens gracing the entry and frame of each hut.

Lik made headlines in December when he sold the world's most expensive photograph to an unnamed buyer for $7.87 million.

The black and white photo 'Phantom', which shows a ghostlike shape in a light beam within Arizona's Antelope Canyon, was sold along with two other images for a total of $US10 million ($A12.1 million).

He took his first photo when he was eight after his parents gave him a Brownie Kodak camera and he snapped a picture of a spider web in his backyard.

In 1984, the then-25-year-old moved to the America, where he developed a passion for landscape photography and the panoramic camera.
