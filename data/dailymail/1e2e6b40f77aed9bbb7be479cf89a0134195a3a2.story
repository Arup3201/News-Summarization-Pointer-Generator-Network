He has been pegged as the natural successor of Sir David Attenborough.

So it is no great surprise that Professor Brian Cox should bare a striking resemblance to the natural treasure as he re-created one of his first TV magazine covers.

The 45-year-old posed with an armadillo in a mock-up of the Radio Times ‘Zoo Quest’ cover with Sir Attenborough in 1959.

The humorous shoot is part of a series of covers and events to mark the magazine’s forth-coming 90th anniversary.

On another cover, Kirsty Young recreates an iconic cover of her broadcasting predecessor Sue Lawley.

Speaking at this year’s covers party, 87-year-old Attenborough appointed Professor Cox his successor in a speech. The broadcaster and naturalist whose career has endured for 60 years said: ‘If I had a torch, I would hand it to you.’

Therefore the obvious comparison of ‘then and now’ to celebrate their coming birthday fell in recreating Sir Attenborough’s first photo shoot.

Holding 12-year-old armadillo Bruce – loaned to the magazine from a private zoo in Oxford – Professor Cox smiles as he imitates the TV legends 1950s quiff.

The two men recently missed each other while visiting Australia on lecture tours.

As part of the birthday celebrations the magazine is also running a competition inviting readers to create their own cover photo.

Competition entrants will have to download the Blippar app from an Apple store or Google play.

After opening the app, entrants – who have until October 15 –should hold their phone or tablet over the cover then take a photo.

The magazine will feature a selection of the best covers in a future edition, and the editor will select one winner to receive an exclusive invitation to our Covers Party in January 2014.

But Sir Attenborough is unlikely to take part. In a recent interview told how he avoids social media and apps because of internet trolls.

He said: ‘The worst thing is that on some of these social networks, people actually pretend they’re me and put out false messages.

‘There are at least two sites that say they are me and I have to get a lawyer to get them taken down. On Facebook and twitter there are obscene ones.

‘They’re horrible, rude – sexy rude – god knows why they do it, I don’t. So if anyone wants to know, I do not have any social networking.’

His new series The Rise of Animals: Triumph of the vertebrates is currently winning millions of viewers on BBC2.

The first cover of the Radio Times was published September 1923.

Earlier this month Sir Attenborough was ranked the second most photographed face of the Radio Times, after the Queen, he has appeared on 20 covers throughout his work in television.

Radio Times Editor Ben Preston , said: 'Over the last 90 years Radio Times covers have featured the good and great of British broadcasting reflecting the history of television and radio and the country itself.‘

Professor Cox, who presented Horizon, is best known for his work on science programmes for the BBC, boosting the popularity of subjects such as astronomy and physics.
