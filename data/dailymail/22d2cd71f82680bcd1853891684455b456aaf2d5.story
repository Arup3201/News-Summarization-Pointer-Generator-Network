The Cornish are to be recognised as a national minority group for the first time, it has been revealed.

Chief Secretary Danny Alexander announced the decision today, saying it meant for the first time that Cornish people would receive the same rights and protections as other minorities in Britain.

It will also mean they are classified under the European Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities the same as the UK's other Celtic people, the Scots, the Welsh and the Irish.

Welcome to Cornwall: Campaigners say the region deserves special measures - including economic concessions, such as reductions in fuel duty - in recognition of its geographical location and cultural heritage

Liberal Democrat Cabinet minister Mr Alexander, 41, who is making a visit to Bodmin today, said: ‘Cornish people have a proud history and a distinct identity.

‘I am delighted that we have been able to officially recognise this and afford the Cornish people the same status as other minorities in the UK.’

Campaigners say the region deserves special measures - including economic concessions, such as reductions in fuel duty - in recognition of its geographical location and cultural heritage.

Those who have pushed over a 15-year period for Cornwall to be fully recognised under European rules for the protection of national minorities welcomed the announcement.

Dick Cole, leader of Cornish independence party Mebyon Kernow, said: ‘This is a fantastic development.

‘A lot of people have been working for many years to get Cornwall the recognition other Celtic people of the UK already receive. The detail is still to come out on what this might mean, but make no mistake that this is a proud day for Cornwall.’

He told MailOnline: ‘The actual 
implementation isn't going to cost the Government. There's no immediate 
of promise of money from central government.

‘But in terms of promoting the culture, there's going to be opportunities to access money. It's also the responsibility for the people of Cornwall to make it work us.’

Praise: Prime Minister David Cameron said Cornwall had a 'very special place in my heart'

Mr Cole also said that it is not the case that all councils will have to employ Cornish diversity officers, because they all already have equality and diversity strategies which will now cover the Cornish as well.

And in terms of road signs in Cornwall, there are at least 1,000 already in place, he said - and they are all being built on new estates to avoid any extra cost of replacing existing signs.

In response to claims by critics that the Cornish are no different to any other community in England, Mr Cole said: ‘Already the Welsh, Irish and Scots were protected by the framework on the basis of their national origins.

‘If you take that basic starting point, Cornwall is exactly the same. The position for Cornwall is that it is specifically a Celtic area.’   

Prime Minister David Cameron, whose daughter Florence was born in the county while the Cameron family were on holiday in 2010, said Cornwall had a ‘very special place in my heart’.

Florence was born during a family holiday in August 2010, and was given the middle name Endellion in honour of the village of St Endellion near where the Camerons were staying in Cornwall.

Mr Cameron told BBC Radio Cornwall: ‘I am very proud of the fact that she was born in Cornwall, very proud of the fact that she carries the name Endellion - a church which means a lot to me.

Beautiful: Porthtowan beach, near Redruth in Cornwall. Today;s announcement means when Government policy is considered, ministers will have to think how this will affect people in Cornwall

‘I've been to a wedding of one of my best friends there and very sadly buried another of my friends there. Cornwall has a very special place in my heart.

After 15 years of vigorous campaigning, Cornwall today moved closer to gaining greater cultural and political recognition.

The announcement means when Government policy is considered, ministers will have to think how this will affect people in Cornwall.

Campaigners say there could now be social, education and broadcasting policy which benefits Cornwall more than in the past.

The Cornish will be recognised as a national minority under the European Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities - meaning they will be afforded the same 'protections' when policy is considered as the Welsh, Scottish and the Irish. 

The full details of any economic benefit borne from Cornwall's inclusion in the convention have yet to be known, though it is billed as helping strengthen the Cornish brand, as well as recognise the distinctiveness of the Cornish.

Campaigners on the peninsula have long argued the region deserves special measures - including fuel duty reductions - in recognition of its cultural heritage and geographical location.

They had also claimed that decisions affecting them were
being made in Westminster without their input. The measure commits Britain to preserving and promoting the Cornish identity, but does not bring extra money.

‘I love it when we go down to Cornwall now and Florence is there. Some shopkeepers single her out for special attention and say “well I want to talk to the Cornish one first”. So she gets the pasty before anybody else.’

Communities Minister Stephen Williams added: ‘This is a great day for the people of Cornwall who have long campaigned for the distinctiveness and identity of the Cornish people to be recognised officially.

‘The
 Cornish and Welsh are the oldest peoples on this island and as a proud 
Welshman I look forward to seeing Saint Piran's Flag flying with extra 
Celtic pride on March 5 next year.’

Campaigners have taken their message to Westminster in recent years after concerns policies affecting them were being made from Whitehall without their consideration.

Half a million people signed a petition - swelled by support from newspapers including the Western Morning News - opposing 2012's controversial ‘pasty tax’.

And thousands marched through Cornwall and in Westminster in an ultimately successful effort to get the Government to reverse plans imposing VAT on hot Cornish pasties.

Independent Cornwall Councillor Bert Biscoe, who worked on the campaign, said: ‘I very much welcome that the Cornish as a group can stand equally beside all other groups in British society.’

Fellow campaigner and comedian Edward 
Rowe, also known as the Kernow King, added: ‘This is obviously great 
news for the people of Cornwall.

‘I
 think there is always going to be a certain degree of pessimism when 
politicians are involved - are they going to be chasing votes, for 
example.

‘But it is great for Cornwall to get the recognition for its culture and heritage that it deserves.’

In the spotlight: A tongue-in-cheek plot played out in the BBC¿s spoof comedy W1A last month looked at the issue of Cornwall being under-represented on the Corporation

North
 Cornwall MP Dan Rogerson said: ‘Today's announcement means that the 
Cornish will finally be recognised as one of the constituent peoples of 
the UK alongside the Welsh, Scottish and Irish.

Backing: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the Government would invest a further £120,000 into the Cornish Language Partnership

‘It will also make sure that public institutions take account of Cornwall's unique identity.'

The Liberal Democrat added: ‘Despite the fact that the last Labour Government said that the Cornish couldn't be recognised in this way, Liberal Democrats in Coalition Government have made sure that the Cornish people, and our traditions, culture and heritage, now have the same status as everyone else.'

The announcement follows previous commitments, which included formal recognition of the Cornish language.

In March, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the Government would be investing a further £120,000 into the Cornish Language Partnership to promote and develop the language.

Mr Cole added: ‘In 2002, the Government recognised the Cornish language through a charter, and it's putting money in to help with the revival.

‘So we've always been arguing that it's a bit silly - you're recognising a minority language, but not a minority group from which it came. What they've done today is to close the circle.’

Residents of Cornwall traditionally spoke a Celtic language similar to that of France's Brittany region.

Separately, a tongue-in-cheek plot played out in the BBC’s spoof comedy W1A last month looked at the issue of Cornwall being under-represented on the Corporation.

A fictional local presenter in the series - which looks at what might go on behind closed doors at the BBC - felt that she could not work as a national presenter because of a perceived anti-Cornish bias.

The series, which ran for four episodes as a follow-up to Twenty Twelve, starred Hugh Bonneville.
