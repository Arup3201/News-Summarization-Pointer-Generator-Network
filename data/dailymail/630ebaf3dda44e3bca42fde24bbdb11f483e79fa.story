Hello Mexico: People dine at the new Dinner in the Sky restaurant overlooking the high-rises of exclusive neighborhood of Santa Fe in Mexico City on Friday, Nov. 29, 2013

A crane lifts the 22-seater table about 150 feet in the air from a lot next to the Sheraton hotel in Santa Fe

The 'flying dinner table' straps 22 
guests into race car seats on the ground in a similar fashion to a 
roller-coaster ride before a crane lifts the party up into the air.

Most of the food is cooked in advance and finished off in a convection oven by staff on the platform when they are in the sky.

The kitchen staff stay in a space at the center of the table.

A seasonal American artisanal menu is on offer, with guests choosing from two appetizers, three entrees and dessert.

For around $230, diners can experience a very unique restaurant experience at Dinner in the Sky

Guests are strapped into race car seats before the platform is raised. Women are recommended leaving heels and flip flips on the ground so as not to lose them

The tables weighs seven tons.

Dinner in the sky has been very popular with bachelorette parties, according to owner Janeen Hinden.

The cost per guest is 3000 pesos, which is about $230.

According
to online reviews, women in heels are recommended to leave their heels 
or flips on the ground because your feet are dangling and you could lose
them.

The floating venue in Santa Fe, Mexico City, has been popular for bachelorette parties and business conferences, but is open to the public

The seats rotate 360 degrees, allowing guests to see all of their surroundings.

While
the 'venue' can be booked out for one party, typically people attend in
couples, families or small groups in a shared environment.
