Arrest: Shawn Eric Ford Jr., 18, has been arrested in the killings of his girlfriend's parents

The boyfriend of a girl whose parents were found bludgeoned to death with a sledgehammer in their home on Tuesday has been arrested for the killings, police said.

Shawn Eric Ford Jr., 18, has been accused of the brutal murders of prominent attorney Jeffrey Schobert, 56, and his 59-year-old wife, Margaret, in their home in Portage Lakes, Ohio.

Their murders came just a week after one of their daughters, Chelsea Schobert, suffered stab wounds and a fractured skull in an attack at a home in Akron. She is now recovering in hospital.

Police had previously speculated that the crimes could be linked. While the connection has still not been confirmed, reports reveal that Ford witnessed the attack on his girlfriend, the Akron Beacon Journal reported.

The bodies of her parents were discovered by workmen carrying out renovations on the couple's house on Tuesday afternoon.

Investigators found a sledgehammer on the bed in their master bedroom next to Jeffrey Schobert's body, a Summit County Medical Examinerâ€™s Office report stated.

Mr Schobert, who was wearing black boxer shorts, suffered a 'large laceration' in the center of his forehead, while his wife had lacerations to the face, the right eye and forehead, investigators said.

Ahead of her death, Mrs Schobert had spent all of Monday night at her daughter's bedside in Akron Children's Hospital and arrived home shortly after 6am on Tuesday.

Killed: The bodies of Peg Schobert, left, and 
her lawyer husband Jeffrey Schobert, right, were found in their home on 
Tuesday by men working on their house. They had both been attacked with a sledgehammer

Attack: Their daughter, Chelsea Schobert, was brutally stabbed just one week before the deaths

Police records noted that at that time she send a text message about Chelsea's boyfriend, but there was no further information on the contents of the message.

New Franklin Police Detective Mike Hitchings added that Mr Schobert was 
last seen walking his dog around 7pm on Monday.

Workmen let themselves into the home at 8am, as per a previous arrangement with the couple, and carried out renovations until one came across the bodies shortly after 2pm and called 911.

Authorities pronounced the couple's deaths at 2.39pm, but when the medical examiner's investigator arrived at 5pm, the bodies were 'cool to touch', suggesting they had been dead for much longer.

Couple: Another man was arrested for the attack that left Chelsea with stab wounds and a fractured skull

Money was also taken from the home, police said. The couple's SUV was also taken and later found abandoned in West Akron on Wednesday.

Ford was taken into custody on Tuesday night and is being held in Portage County Jail on a charge of obstruction of justice.

The Beacon Journal reported that he has another case against him after pleading guilty last month to felony robbery. He had been freed on bond and was scheduled to appear in court on April 15.

He has now been charged with two counts of aggravated murder, two counts of aggravated robbery, two counts of aggravated burglary and grand theft in connection with the slayings.

At a press conference, Det. Michael 
Hitchings said that police had found 'physical evidence in different 
locations' that they believe connects Ford to the murders.

Hitchings added that he has spoken with Ford, but would not say if the teenager admitted to the crimes. He would also not reveal if Ford is the only suspect in the case.

On Chelsea's Facebook profile, she laments bad 
boyfriends and hints that she has recently been through a break up. It 
is understood that Chelsea is adopted.

Jamayne Ruiz, 24, was arrested for the attack on Chelsea Schobert and has not been released. He is being held in jail for felonious assault on a $250,000 bond.

The couple was well-known in the community and active in community affairs.

Jeffrey Schobert was a prominent and well-liked 
health-care lawyer in Akron and had carried out mock trials for students at 
Archbishop Hoban High School, which his two daughters had attended.

Beloved: Neighbours said the couple was well-liked and involved in the community

He is listed on the Hanna Campbell & Powell, LLP website as leading the firm's health-care trial group, representing physicians, hospitals and other providers through the state.

Schobert successfully defended some 
of the firm's most serious cases since starting there in 1987, and was 
elected to the American Board of Trial Advocates as an associate member 
in January 2003.

He was also named one of the state's 
'Super Lawyers' from 2005 to 2011 and has been on a list of 'Best 
Lawyers in America' since 2006, the bio noted.

His wife, who went by 'Peg', was involved with charities, including the Rotary, Interval Brotherhood Home and Junior League.
