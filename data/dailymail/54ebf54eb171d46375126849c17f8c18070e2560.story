A retired bricklayer had his dying wish honoured when he was buried in a coffin shaped like a skip.

Grandfather-of-four Tony Bryan, 74, asked that the unusual casket be taken on a tour of his home town on the back of his work lorry before being buried in his back garden.

After his sudden death from a perforated bowel a fortnight ago, Mr Bryan's son Nick set to work to give his father the send-off he desired.

Family and friends wrote affectionate tributes to Tony Bryan on his coffin, which was built in the shape of a skip

Floral arrangements sat on top of the coffin, which toured Worcester before it was buried

Mourners lined up to add their messages to the casket, which was fastened on to Tony Bryan's work lorry

Dying wish: Tony Bryan had asked to be buried in a coffin shaped like a skip. His son described him as a real family man with a wicked sense of humour

He said: 'The funeral was a celebration of my father's life, not a mourning of his passing.

'That's what he wanted, and I'm not one to mope about anyway.Â 

'A couple of days after his death we felt quite empty and down, but building the skip really took my mind off things.'

More than 150 mourners attended Mr Bryan's funeral service at the Masonic Hall in Worcester on Thursday before his lorry toured the town, taking in the house where he was born, his favourite pubs, and buildings he had worked on.

He was then buried in his one-acre back garden, where he used to enjoy making things out of scrap.

Nick Bryan, 47, said: 'About 150 people came for the 
service, including people from the building trade and people he used to 
go ballroom dancing with.

'We buried him with a load of his 
tools and his work clothes, and he loved bits of scrap metal, so we put 
some of that in there too.'

The casket was built by Mr Bryan's son Nick, 47, in the days after his father's death

The family helped to decorate the coffin with bright yellow paint

Mr Bryan's daughters, Traci and Alexandra, created the 'Dad' and 'Grandad' floral tributes which sat atop the skip

Friends and family wrote tributes to the father-of-three all over the yellow wooden casket, while his daughters Traci and Alexandra made floral tributes in the shape of the words 'Dad' and 'Grandad'.

His eight-year-old grandson Euan, wrote 'I love you' on each panel of the coffin.

Traci James-Scott, 49, said: 'My father will be remembered as a generous man with a wicked sense of humour.

'He loved his family and was proud to be Worcester born and bred.

'The
skip was dad's idea. He died suddenly, no one expected it. He'd had 
different types of cancer and was conquering them one by one.

After the funeral service and tour of Worcester on the back of a lorry, Mr Bryan was laid to rest in his one-acre garden

His son Nick said that the task of building the coffin helped to take his mind off things

The unusual funeral arrangements reflected Tony Bryan's sense of humour and love of DIY, his son said

'He always told stories and had a wicked sense of humour, he was a real family man.

'When we were young, he made us tree houses and swimming pools in the garden and aerial runways across the pond from recycled building materials.'

Mr Bryan, who won a Midlands Best Bricklayer award in the 1950s, is survived by his wife Barbara, 84, their three children and four grandchildren.
