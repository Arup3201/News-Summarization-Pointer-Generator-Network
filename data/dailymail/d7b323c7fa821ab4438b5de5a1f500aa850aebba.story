Across the pond: Michael and Carole Middleton own Party Pieces - a website which sells toys, decorations and fancy-dress costumes

The Duchess of Cambridge's parents have their sights set on the Big Apple as they plan to expand their family business to America, according to reports.

Michael and Carole Middleton own Party Pieces - a party supplies website which sells toys, decorations and fancy-dress costumes.

And now it has been revealed the couple are planning to expand their party empire to the US, perhaps in a shrewd move to fully use their daughter's celebrity status overseas. 

Party Pieces overseas business has 
been extraordinary with America dominating much of the interest. It has 
prompted the Middletons to look at establishing an office in the U.S. so
 that they can bolster their brand and even tie into other companies and
 ventures. They feel New York offers them a good starting point,' a 
source told the New York Daily News. 

Pippa, who has toiled for Carole and 
Michael Middleton’s retail website for nearly three years, editing an 
online blog, Party Times, has reportedly been helping her parents work 
out a location as she is more familiar with the area.

'I am not sure if they will even 
announce the move or just let it happen and move on from there. They are
 adamant they will never trade off Kate’s royal links to get ahead in 
business.'  the source added.

Since their daughter married Prince William in April 2011, the Middletons have had a tightrope to walk.

This
 involves balancing the needs of their business with the desire not to 
embarrass Kate by being accused of cashing in on her royal standing.

'The
 Middletons have been extremely careful not to upset Buckingham Palace 
by seemingly trading off Kate’s link to royalty,' the source added.

'I 
am not sure if they will even announce the move or just let it happen 
and move on from there. They are adamant they will never trade off 
Kate’s royal links to get ahead in business.'

The Middleton's have often been accused of cashing in on their daughter's fame.

Only
 weeks after the official announcement that the Duchess of Cambridge is 
expecting her first child, her parents were seen promoting a range of baby 
goods on their party supplies website.

The ‘Little Prince’ and ‘Little 
Princess’ party packs are described as suitable for American-style baby 
showers, christening parties or first birthday celebrations.

Each pack includes paper cups, napkins and plastic cutlery.

They also include paper plates 
decorated with a pink or blue crown and the words ‘a new little prince’ 
or ‘a new little princess’.

The products left the Middletons open to accusations that  they are cashing in on the royal pregnancy.

And it would not be the first time the
 website, set up by Carole Middleton in 1987, has landed the family in 
hot water.

Last year it offered paraphernalia themed around the
 Royal Wedding and the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.

Its street party items included state 
carriage-shaped cardboard teapot vases, coat of arms cups printed with 
‘Long Live G&T’ and canape flags featuring crown-wearing corgis.

The company – which Mrs Middleton 
started from scratch by making party bags around her kitchen table – had
 a dispute with Britain’s Got Talent after using the show’s logo on the 
site without permission and on another occasion fell foul of strict 
advertising laws covering the London Olympics.

It also rowed with Bond 
film producers Eon Productions after using the logo for the latest James
 Bond film, Skyfall.

Although accounts for the company are 
not publicly available, it is clearly a success for the Middletons, who 
recently bought a £4.7million country home and put their three children 
through private school.

Party Pieces were contacted by the MailOnline - they have not yet commented.
