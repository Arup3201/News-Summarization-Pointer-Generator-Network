Forbes has released this year's list of America's best hipster neighborhoods, and the epitome of all things hipster, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, only came in at number three.

Weighing up the number of single-origin coffee shops, alternative food trucks, organic farmers markets, indie bands and eclectic professions, Silver Lake, Los Angeles took the list's top spot thanks to its booming art scene and avant garde buildings.

Coming in a close second was another Californian hotspot, San Francisco’s Mission District. The city’s oldest neighborhood boasts the highest concentration of street murals in the city, plus handfuls of alternative and locally owned bars and restaurants, thrift shops and galleries.

First place: Silver Lake, Los Angeles is known as an eclectic enclave with some of America's most lauded food trucks and farmer¿s markets, a well-established arts scene and one of the largest creative class communities in the U.S

Determining the trendiest Hipster hangouts is not exactly quantifiable. As a term that used to describe radical socialists with wild ideas and an artist bent in the Seventies, it now embodies RayBan wearing, fixed-gear bike riding, and beard growing youngsters.

The U.S. Oxford dictionary describes a hipster as 'somebody who follows the latest trends and fashions.'

So Forbes enlisted the help of San Fransisco-based start up NextDoor, a neighborhood-specific private social networking site with a community focus.

Analyzing data on over 250 neighborhoods
in the largest U.S. cities each area was assessed by walkability 
according to WalkScore, a website promoting walkable neighbourhoods 
according to their proximity to coffee shops, local food trucks, farmers
markets, locally owned bars and restaurants and galleries.

Second place: Mission district, San Francisco has diversity and lack of pretense, with easygoing restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and food trucks in San Francisco's oldest neighbourhood

Third place: Williamsburg, Brooklyn in New York is thought of as the birthplace of hipsterdom as we know it today, with boutique shopping, a thriving music scene, food trucks and great transit options

Fourth place: Wicker Park, Chicago started attracting artists and young adults in the late Eighties, and the community is known for its galleries, music venues, boutiques and trendy food options

Fifth place: Pearl District, Portland, is known for its art galleries, studios and coffee with the second highest concentration of coffee shops per capita on the list

These were then ranked accord to Zagat's ratings, with NextDoor's 'hipness' index also taken into account, which is based on how often words associated 
with Hipster, like art, gallery, designer, musician, appeared on 
each NextDoor neighborhood’s site pages

NextDoor then conducted a survey
in which members sounded off on their communities, and the percentage of residents who work in artistic occupations was also factored.

While Mission, San Fransciso's lower 
rents were taken into account for its ranking of second place, with 
Dabney Lawless, vice president of NextDoor concluding it makes 'a great 
neighborhood for young trendsetters,' - a euphemism for underpaid and 
struggling artists - Williamsburg, Brooklyn, despite its skyrocketing 
rental prices, came in third.

The unofficial birthplace of 
hipsterdom, Williamsburg is teeming with boutique coffee shops, food 
trucks, alternative nightlife, farmers markets, rustic restaurants, and 
small boutiques.

Its artsy residents that routinely sport
Vans sneakers and meaningless tattoos while carrying the latest New 
Yorker and Olso coffee cup on a Sunday morning helped to single-handedly
spawn the hipster craze as we know it today.

Coined 'Bo-bo's by the French (standing for Bohemian-bourgeois), these attractive youngsters have helped rents rise, much like SoHo before it, leading to a slight exodus of artists and a new influx of families as gentrification progresses.

David Morley, a research associate with 
the American Planning Association, a nonprofit educational group for 
community developers, said 'The more successful neighborhoods like Williamsburg become in attracting people, the real estate prices go up and a lot of the urban pioneers end up moving on,'Portland, Oregon’s Pearl District, ranked number five on the Forbes list thanks to 
its closely clustered coffee shops - with the second-highest 
concentration of coffee shops of any neighborhood on the list - its 
flourishing foodie culture, including the Portland Farmers Market, a colorful collection street art and obviously, its music scene.

However as a neighbourhood that has been undergoing urban renewal since the Nineties, some hipsters are fleeing the rising costs of new high-rise condos and warehouse-to-loft conversions for the less established, and less pricey, Mississippi Ave and the Alberta Arts District neighborhoods.

Clearly next year's top 20 hipster hangouts could look completely different.
