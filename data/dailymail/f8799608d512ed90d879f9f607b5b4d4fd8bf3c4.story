Sir Michael Caine is in mourning after the death of his younger brother who starred alongside him in hit films such as The Italian Job.

Stanley Micklewhite, who played Coco in the hit 1969 film, was 77 when he passed away in January.

The actor and writer also joined his older sibling on screen in Billion Dollar Brain in 1967 and Play Dirty in 1968. 

Despite being devastated by his brother's death, Sir Michael did not attend Stanley's funeral as he was so concerned that it would turn into a circus.

Mr Micklewhite’s widow Marie told the Daily Mirror: 'We’ve kept it very quiet because we didn’t want a big fuss about it.

'Michael couldn’t even come to the funeral because we knew there would be a media circus around it.

'But Michael is grieving for his brother. They were very close.'

Sir
Michael, who celebrates his 80th birthday tomorrow, and his younger 
brother were brought up together in a small flat in Southwark, Central 
London, until they were evacuated to Norfolk at the start of World War 
II.

The two brothers 
both went on to pursue acting careers but while Sir Michael became a 
Hollywood star, his brother ended up taking a job working at the 
Selfridges department store.

But
Mr Micklewhite, of Ruislip, North West London, was able to give his job
up and pursue his dream to become a writer when his successful older 
brother offered to pay him an allowance.

Mr
Micklewhite said: 'Mike said to me in the 70s or 80s, "what are you up 
to?" and I said, "well I’m writing in the evenings for about an hour" 
and he said, "I’ll give you a small allowance of £95".

'So I said, "alright" and left there [Selfridges] and started writing.

'He’s upped the ante, but that’s all he gives me, a little allowance every month.'

Sir Michael also offered his young brother and his wife Marie exotic holidays but Mr Micklewhite often turned down the generous offers because he'd given up alcohol.

Six years ago, Stanley told the Daily Mail: 'He phoned me the other day and said, "I’ve got this idea. You can go anywhere you like for two weeks or a month. Everything paid for, like Barbados’s Sandy Lane hotel... and first class".'

He then added: 'He invites us down a lot. We’d love to sit and drink the best wines in the world but we can’t.'

Mr Micklewhite’s death in January came as Sir Michael also lost his friend the director Sir Michael Winner.

He said at the time: 'I’m very sad to lose such a wonderful friend. I will treasure our great and wonderful relationship.'

Sir Michael was last week given the Freedom of the City of London at a service at the Museum of London, which is hosting an ­exhibition on his life ahead of his 80th birthday tomorrow.

He sent a thank you to his Twitter followers for his birthday messages, saying: ‘Thank you for your kind birthday messages. Will blow the candles off.’ 

Fans will recall his famous line from the 1969 comedy film The Italian Job: ‘You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!’
