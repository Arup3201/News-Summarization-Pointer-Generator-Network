 It was supposed to be a high-profile, cheerful celebration of Countryfile’s best-known star.

But last week’s programme to mark John Craven’s 25 years with the BBC’s rural affairs series has degenerated into a bitter row – after former presenter Miriam O’Reilly accused the Corporation of ‘erasing’ her from the show’s history.

Ms O’Reilly co-hosted Countryfile with Mr Craven for eight years from 2001. But the anniversary programme did not include one shot or mention of her, despite showing dozens of clips from Mr Craven’s years on the series.

Former Countryfile presenter Miriam O'Reilly, who says she was deliberately left out of a tribute to fellow presenter John Craven 

She believes that a deliberate decision to exclude her was taken because BBC bosses have still not forgiven her for launching a landmark age-discrimination case against the Corporation after she was axed from Countryfile in 2009.

Ms O’Reilly, now 57, and three fellow female presenters in their 40s and 50s – Juliet Morris, Charlotte Smith and Michaela Strachan – were dropped ahead of the programme leaving its Sunday morning slot for a prime time evening slot.

While the three other presenters went quietly, Ms O’Reilly took the BBC to an employment tribunal and won a case for age discrimination. She is believed to have been awarded between £100,000 and £250,000.

‘I am not angry, as I am past that now. But I am disappointed,’ she said after watching the anniversary Countryfile.

‘I feel I’ve been erased from the show’s history. It was the BBC’s way of wiping out my contribution because I challenged them at this tribunal.

‘I appreciate the show was marking John’s 25th anniversary at Countryfile, and he was editing it, but I presented the show with him for eight years and they’ve left me completely out.’

She also pointed out that she worked for the BBC for 25 years and has won a number of prestigious awards.

In last Sunday’s show, the three other female presenters who were axed with Ms O’Reilly also did not get a mention. But the younger presenter hired to replace them in 2009, Julia Bradbury, now 44, was shown twice.

Ms O’Reilly said she had not intended to watch the anniversary Countryfile, but fans who follow her on Twitter alerted her to the snub.

One fan, known as ‘Craig O’, tweeted: ‘It’s not right that you seem to have been erased from its history but BBC are good at not mentioning certain things!’

Another wrote: ‘Catching up with John Craven’s 25yr retrospective on #Countryfile. Strangely, no Miriam O’Reilly to be seen... It was appalling.’

Speaking from her home in Aberdovey, Wales, Ms O’Reilly said she had a ‘professional and friendly’ relationship with Mr Craven, 73, and does not believe he was responsible for editing her out of the show. She believes that it was the work of BBC executives who have ‘blacklisted’ her.

‘I feel they just have not accepted the findings of the tribunal, where judges said that I was discriminated against because of my age,’ she said.

‘Publicly they said they accepted its findings, but privately they did not.

‘This is why I have been left out. It’s childish and mean, but that’s how they are.’

After her tribunal victory, Ms O’Reilly was given a three- year contract to work across the BBC. But she terminated her deal two years early after receiving very little work.

Last night the BBC denied that Ms O’Reilly was blacklisted.

A spokesman said: ‘Sunday’s Countryfile was a celebratory edition for long-standing presenter John Craven and included some of his most memorable moments from his 25 years on the show.

‘The programme was not intended as a look back at the entire history of Countryfile but purely to mark John’s anniversary and his contributions.’

Mr Craven was not available for comment.
