Jack Wilshere reckons his family would never forgive him if he was not up for the challenge of helping England tackle Scotland on Tuesday night.

The Arsenal midfielder produced a man-of-the-match display as England recorded a fourth straight Euro 2016 qualifying victory after coming from behind to defeat Slovenia 3-1 at Wembley on Saturday.

Roy Hodgson's squad, though, immediately turned focus on delivering the required performance up at Celtic Park, where the atmosphere will be white hot.

Wilshere, 22, insists everyone knows how important securing those bragging rights will be, both north and south of the border.

'I am desperate to play. They are the games that every England player wants to be playing in,' said Wilshere.

'You ask any member of my family or anyone who knows what it (rivalry) is like - and they would never forgive me if I didn't play.

'They will always say 'England-Scotland, that it is going to be a great atmosphere', so I want to play in that, of course I do.'

Wilshere started England's breathless 3-2 win over Scotland at Wembley last August, and also has first-hand experience of the 'incredible atmosphere' at Parkhead, from when Arsenal played a Champions League qualifier in 2009.

'Tuesday night is not going to be very friendly, and we have got to be ready for that,' he said.

'It will be a bit like Arsenal v Tottenham, Liverpool against Man United, but we are used to that as players.

'We played Scotland at Wembley last year, and it wasn't the friendliest (of games) then, so we know what we are in for.

'It is going to be a bit tougher this time as they will be a bit more up for it on their home ground, so we will have to be ready for it.'

Wilshere insists the younger members of the squad have been left in no doubt as to the historical importance of the tie.

'Of course it has the same meaning (now),' he said.

'The manager has already given us a speech about England v Scotland and told us that back in the day, it was the highlight of the season.

'The coaching staff are going to get us ready, we know what we will be walking into and we will definitely be up for it.'
