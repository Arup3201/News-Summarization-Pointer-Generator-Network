A woman who was trampled by her own horse has had her ribcage rebuilt with 'Meccano'

Barbara Schofield, 52, suffered nine broken ribs and a punctured lung in the accident, but was back in the saddle after just 10 weeks.

Surgeons at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital used pioneering titanium technology to rebuild Barbara's ribcage.

Only a handful of hospitals in the country use the technique, in which titanium plates and screws are used to help mend cracked bones.

The Synthes Matrix Rib System, developed in Switzerland, uses a series of curved titanium plates around 10 to 20cms long and 10mm wide.

They are sculpted in a factory and fine-tuned by a surgeon to fit the contours of the patient's ribs - like a Meccano set.

She was trampled when the saddle slipped as she rode her four-year-old gelding Figaro in Willaston, on the Wirral, Merseyside.

The damage also caused air and blood to go between her lung and rib cage which was an additional complication.

She was taken by ambulance to the Royal Liverpool University Hospital's emergency department.

There, she underwent pioneering surgery to rebuild her ribcage using plates and screws.

The new technique sees tailor-made surgical plates pinned to the broken bones to alleviate pain and speed up recovery.

It can allow patients to escape complications such as pneumonia, breathing difficulties and chest deformity and has a recovery time of just a few days.

Until recently, the only treatment for broken ribs was to strap them up and take painkillers until they had healed.

Ms Schofield remained at the Royal's intensive care unit for seven days.

The trauma collaborative work - across the three hospitals - has led to a reduction in the length of stay a patient requires in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) by more than four days.

Within 10 weeks Ms Schofield, a part-time clinical physiologist in cardiology at Warrington Hospital, was back in the saddle for the first time since the accident attempting to regain her confidence.

She said: 'I'm delighted with the innovative surgery Sanjay Kalra performed. 

'He has worked wonders and I am extremely grateful to him as his expertise has resulted in a much more timely and successful recovery.

Ms Schofield was taken to the Royal Liverpool University Hospital's emergency department. There, she underwent pioneering surgery to rebuild her ribcage. The new technique, Synthes Rib Matrix, involves tailor made plates being pinned to the broken bones to speed up recovery and alleviate pain

Each plate is about half an inch wide and is shaped to match the contours of the ribs. Until recently, the only treatment for broken ribs was to strap them up and take painkillers until they had healeD

Now recovered, Ms Schofield said: 'It's been a bit of a joke with friends and colleagues referring to me as 'barbed wire' instead of Barbara and also the 'bionic woman'

'I realised that this surgery was quite novel and I'm lucky to have had this technology and procedure on my doorstep, in Liverpool.

'I am so fortunate to have been dealt with by such a talented surgical team.

'It's been a bit of a joke with friends and colleagues referring to me as 'barbed wire' instead of Barbara and also the 'bionic woman'!

'I've not been through the security body scanners at an airport yet - they will probably never have seen anything quite like it!'

Sanjay Kalra, consultant trauma and orthopaedic surgeon, said: 'With this technology the procedure we use not only reduces the risk of complications but encourages a faster return to normal function.

'It is only recommended for patients who have suffered severe chest trauma with multiple broken ribs.

'The results and patient outcomes have been excellent for patients like Barbara at the both the Royal and Aintree hospitals.' 

Until recently, the only treatment for broken ribs was to strap them up and take painkillers until they had healed.

This could take months and left the patient in danger of complications such as breathing difficulties, pneumonia and chest deformity.

The new technique, Synthes Rib Matrix, sees patients undergo a 2 hour operation which is available both on the NHS and privately.

During the surgery, tailor made plates are pinned to the broken bones to speed up recovery and alleviate pain.

Each plate is about half an inch wide and is shaped to match the contours of the ribs.

The recovery time from the operation is only a few days.

The plates are left in the body for the rest of the patient's life.
