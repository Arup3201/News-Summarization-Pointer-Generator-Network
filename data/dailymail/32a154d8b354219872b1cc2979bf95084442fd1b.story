The outcome of a child's GCSE results are down not only to the hours spent revising but also the mindset of their mother, an academic study has revealed.

Research published by the London School of Economics' Centre for Economic Performance (CEP) shows that babies born to mothers who are strong believers that their fate is in their hands perform up to 17 per cent better in exams when they grow up.

The study, which analysed data from the University of Bristol's Children of the 90s project – a long-term study of the attitudes and behaviour of 10,000 young people, tracked the formation of a key personality trait known as 'locus of control'.

Those with an 'internal locus' believe they can entirely direct the course of their life while those with an extremely 'external locus' believe their life path is influenced solely by luck or fate.

While most people tend to fall somewhere between these two extremes, those with a very 'internal locus' tend to invest more into their education than those who fall at the other end of the spectrum.

Dr Francesca Cornaglia said the research proved that the influence of a mother's personality was highly influential of a child's education.

The Queen Mary University of London economist told The Guardian: 'Holding other things constant – including family background, mother's education and children's own locus of control – we find that children whose mothers ranked in the top 25% of the internal locus of control scale tended to obtain total GCSE scores around 17% higher than children whose mothers ranked in the bottom 25%.'

Professor Nattavudh Powdthavee, a senior author of the recent study, said that mothers who have a strong 'internal locus' tend to take a more hands-on approach to parenting.

He told the newspaper: 'This is simply because they strongly believe their actions will make a difference in their child's life.

'Consequently, they tend to engage their children in more cognitively stimulating activities such as reading and singing. This seems to have given their children a head start in terms of cognitive development.'

The research comes after it was revealed that a record number of appeals are expected over this year's GCSE and A-level results amid a toughening up of the qualifications.

Exams watchdog Ofqual has already told schools to expect 'particularly volatile' GCSE results as grades are likely to dip following major changes to the exams system in England.

Changes to GCSEs include a switch to end-of-year exams, the downgrading of coursework and a clampdown on resits by only including a pupil's first attempt in official league tables.

It means an unprecedented number of challenges from pupils who are unhappy with their results is expected when the results are released on Thursday.
