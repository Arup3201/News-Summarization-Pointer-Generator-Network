A heartbreaking 911 call reveals the moment a 13-year-old boy, who witnessed his father brutally stabbing his mother to death, told 911: 'My dad just killed my mom.'

The boy's father, Jeremy Roberts, 38, allegedly stabbed his ex-wife Candice Roberts, 36, as she arrived to collect their two children from his Grove City, Ohio apartment.

After watching his father greet the woman before returning with a knife to stab her outside the home, the unidentified boy called 911 - and pleaded with police not to harm his dad.

'Murder': Jeremy Roberts, left, has been arrested after allegedly stabbing his ex-wife Candice Roberts, right, to death outside his apartment as their children watched. Their son then called 911

'My dad just killed my mom. He just told me to call you guys,' the boy said in a recording of the call. 'He just ran out and killed my mom, and she's laying in the grass in front of our apartment.'

As the dispatcher called for officers to go to the scene, the boy asked police not to harm his father.

'Please, guys, don't do anything to him in front of me, please,' he said. 'He has no weapons.'

The boy then handed the phone to his father, who told the dispatcher he was not going to harm anyone else and that the only weapon he had was a knife that was left outside with the body.

Stabbed: Police found Candice, who was engaged to another man, dead under a blanket in the yard

Heartbroken: Ms Roberts's daughter Kayla said that her brother is haunted by what he witnessed

On the 911 call, which is nearly five minutes long, he asks if he could kiss his children before telling them he loves them and saying he was going to the front door to meet the police.

'I told you that there's a lot of things
that you don't understand and you don't know,' he can be heard telling the children. 'And now there's no 
choice for them to come out.'

He added that they have a 'good big 
sister [who] will take care of you guys'.

Officers found his ex-wife, who was engaged to marry another man, dead in a grassy area covered by a blanket. Jeremy Roberts was standing nearby and was arrested.

Candice Roberts's 16-year-old daughter Kayla told WCMH she feels 
'incomplete and abandoned' after the death of her mother, and that her 
brother is haunted by what he saw.

'Killer': On the 911 call, Roberts can be heard telling his children that now 'a lot of things you don't understand' will be made public. He hugs them goodbye before officers arrive to arrest him

Scene: Ms Roberts had arrived at her ex-husband's apartment in Grove City, Ohio to collect their children

Murder: He came outside with a knife and stabbed her in the yard before putting a blanket over her

'My brother says that every time he 
opens his eyes, he sees my mother's face and her yelling, "Help me!"' 
the teenager said. 'And she sees my dad standing there with the blood 
all over him, and the knife in his hand.'

The daughter added that she 'would do
everything for him to be held accountable'. 'You don't just get to 
murder somebody and get away with it,' she said.

Kayla stated that her parents rarely fought and instead believes her father 'snapped' for no reason.

The children are staying with their grandparents. Ms Roberts also leaves behind a fiance.

Roberts is charged with murder and made his first appearance on Monday at Franklin County Municipal Court. Bond was set at $250,000. He remains in custody at the county jail.

His next court date is scheduled for June 20.
