Arsenal legend Thierry Henry is attracting the interest of French giants Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco according to reports in France as uncertainty continues to surround the striker's future in New York.

The 37-year-old, who has been at New York Red Bulls since 2010, will be out of contract with the MLS side at the end of the year and could be open to a move back to Europe in January.

Speculation has been rife that Henry is set to retire but the former Gunner could also return for a third spell at Arsenal.

Henry started his glittering career at Monaco back in 1996 where he scored 21 goals in 115 appearances

The Frenchman, playing against another former club Juventus, played for Monaco between 1995-1999

Thierry Henry began his career in France at Monaco during a five-year spell from 1994 to 1999, when he joined Juventus:

Appearances: 115

Goals: 21

Honours: Ligue 1 title 1996-97, Trophee des champions 1997

Le10 Sport claims Henry could be pursued by the Ligue 1 giants and could return to his first club, Monaco.

New York's global head of football, former Liverpool boss Gerard Houllier, has fuelled the speculation of a move to Ligue 1 by stating Henry could still play at the top level in France.

'If he has the level to play in Ligue 1? Yes, no problem,' Houllier told Le10 Sport.

'So far no decision has been made, either in one direction or the other. Thierry has not decided to end his career,' added Houllier.

'We would love to keep it but it will also depend on him. Besides Thierry is in shape, it gives the impression of not growing old because he scores goal on goal.

'If there is another strategy that is to start with another squad, younger as the team gains a bit of experience, I think that Thierry could be part of this adventure.

'But it was confirmed that neither he nor the club had not made ​​a decision.'
