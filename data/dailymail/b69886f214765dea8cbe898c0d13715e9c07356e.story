A sleeping family were saved from a blaze in their living room – when it was doused by water from the fish tank.

Father-of-three Steve Whitehall forgot to blow out a candle when he went to bed on Wednesday. 

The unsupervised flame then sparked the fire early the next morning.

But when it reached the 100-litre fish tank, it caused the glass to explode – causing 22 gallons of water to flood the burning lounge and waking the family upstairs.

The 48-year-old from Warrington escaped unharmed with his teenaged children and wife Elizabeth, 45, before calling the fire brigade at 6.55am.

Only small pockets of fire remained, as water from the tank had put most of it out.

The family lost 13 of their 15 fish, but fire crews said the Whitehalls had had 'a very lucky escape'.

Mr Whitehall said: 'We often have candles burning around the house and are usually very careful about making sure they are all out before we go to bed or go out.

'Unfortunately, we missed one last night and I cannot believe the damage that has been caused from just that one candle.

'Please, please, everyone, take great care if burning candles.

'We now have to sort out a fire damaged lounge, replace Christmas presents and have lost over 13 fish in the blaze.

'Fortunately, two survived in the couple of centimetres of water left in the tank.

'But, more importantly, I dread to think what would have happened if the sound of the breaking tank hadn't woken us and alerted us to the fire.'

Tony Taylor, crew manager at Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service, said: 'The Whitehalls have had a very lucky escape from what could have been a much more serious incident.

'Candles do need to be treated with great care, particularly at this time of the year.

'Mr and Mrs Whitehall, who have got smoke alarms fitted in their property, did the right thing by shutting internal doors before going to bed.

'This contained the fire to just the one room but we would recommend smoke alarms are fitted in rooms where candles are being burnt.'
