Comedian Al Murray has boasted that he could drink ‘Nigel Farage under the table, as he steps up his election campaign against the Ukip leader.

The ‘Pub Landlord’ announced last week that he will stand against Mr Farage at the next election, potentially taking crucial votes off the Ukip leader in his bid to unseat the Tories.

He has now unveiled a series of comedy policies for his newly-formed political party ‘FUKP’ – the Free United Kingdom Party – including renaming benefits ‘scrounge credits’, turning off the internet at the weekend and making the rock band Queen play the national anthem ‘at all state occasions’.

The 'Pub Landlord' said he will stand in Thanet South, Kent, for his newly-formed Free United Kingdom Party

CURRENCY

The pound will be revalued at £1.10, so it will now be worth 10p more.

NHS 

If you come to A&E and it's neither an accident nor an emergency, then you will be sent to a random hospital department to be practised on.

FOREIGN POLICY 

Germany has been too quiet for too long. Just saying.

IMMIGRATION 

The reason they are coming here is because this is the greatest country in the world. The only way to stop them is for a government to change that and make things a whole lot worse.

EUROPE

Greece to be bought and operated by Kent County Council. Couldn't be worse. Someone to do the bins at least.

LAW AND ORDER

Unemployment causes crime: I propose to lock up the unemployed.

Murray will stand in Thanet South, Kent - the seat targeted by Mr Farage in his bid to finally enter Parliament.

Explaining his decision to stand last week, the Oxford-educated  comic said: 'It seem to me that the UK is ready for a bloke waving a pint around, offering common sense solutions.'

He pledged to 'lock up the unemployed', run Greece from Kent County Council and revalue the pound at £1.10 so it will be 'worth 10p more'. 

But today Murray has gone further - promising nationalise all pubs and make it illegal to call casseroles with pastry lids ‘pies’.

Asked who would win in a three-way lager-off – you, William Hague or Nigel Farage? – he said: ‘These men are amateurs.' 

He added: 'The drinking itself wouldn’t be a challenge – in fact, I’d say there isn’t a table in the land I couldn’t drink them under.

‘No, it’s the company that would be an issue. You’d have Farage pretending he’s not a public-school stockbroker and actually some sort of man of the people – and what sort of muppet pretends to be someone they’re not, eh?

‘I ask you. And then Hague droning on and on about the time he met Angelina Jolie. No thanks.’

Asked about protecting people from ‘snooping’ security agencies, he added: ‘Personally, I think it would be good for the country if we turned off the internet at 5pm on Friday and only turned it back on on Monday morning.

‘There would be no more drunk tweeting, no more vengeful emails to the ex, impulse purchases on Amazon (or whatever right-on site you lot use at the Guardian), no more having to use In Private Browsing or whatever it’s called as you cry lonely tears in your bedsit.’

Murray also promised to make rock band Queen ‘play the national anthem at all state occasions’ and ‘change the name of benefits to Scrounge Credits’.

In a video posted online he explained: 'Let it be known that like many of the Parliamentary hopefuls in the forthcoming election, I have no idea where South Thanet is - but did that stop Margaret Thatcher from saving the Falkland Islands? No.'

Murray, 46, is standing in a constituency which the Conservative Party won from Labour at the previous election in 2010.

It is already the focus of huge attention due to Mr Farage's decision to stand there as UKIP experiences a surge of support and now has two Parliamentary seats. His party took 5.5 per cent of the votes in the seat five years ago.

The Pub Landlord took a dig at Mr Farage, explaining his decision to stand. He said: 'It seem to me that the UK is ready for a bloke waving a pint around, offering common sense solutions'

His decision to stand comes two years after fellow comic Simon Brodkin - known for his character Lee Nelson - handed in nomination papers to stand in a by-election at South Shields, for David Miliband's former seat. He went on to withdraw later the same day.

Other proposals include his pledge on law and order: 'Unemployment causes crime: I propose to lock up the unemployed. Common sense.'

And on the hot topic of immigration, he says: 'Of course the reason they are coming here is because this is the greatest country in the world.

The only way to stop them is for a government to change that and make things a whole lot worse. Look no further.

'However, in the meantime, we brick up the Channel Tunnel. With British bricks. Probably have to get some Poles in to do it. Common sense.'

In his online address, Murray explains: 'The reason I'm standing is because the system is broken, we all know it is. You hear people saying 'you shouldn't vote'. Well you should vote boys and girls, you should vote for me.'

He also promises '1p a pint', although 'crisps will remain at the current price'.

The party's logo features an upturned pound sign, in a clear parody of the UKIP symbol.

Mr Farage's team appeared unconcerned about the threat posed by The Pub Landlord.

A spokesman for the Ukip leader said: 'At last, serious competition in the constituency.'
