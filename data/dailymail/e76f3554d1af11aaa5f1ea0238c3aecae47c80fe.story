Fernando Torres is much-maligned for his poor scoring record at Chelsea, where his 46 goals cost more than £1million per strike.

Now he has returned to his boyhood club Atletico Madrid, surely his fortunes will improve, right?

Well if his first training session on loan from AC Milan is anything to go by, perhaps not. In front of the cameras in Majadahonda, at Atletico's training ground, Torres struggled to hit the target - scoring just one of his five headed attempts in a shooting drill.

The ex-Chelsea striker was all smiles as he spoke to coach Oscar Ortega, despite his poor performance

Unfortunately, the ball ends up wide of the target, leaving the coach stretching to receive it

Fernando Torres' goalscoring record at Chelsea does not look good:

Premier League: 20 goals in 110 games

Domestic cups: 7 goals in 19 games

European competitions: 19 goals in 43 games

Total: 46 goals in 172 games

The clip will fuel Chelsea fans' views that ridding themselves of 'El Nino' was the right decision, while Atletico coach Diego Simeone will have a tough job on his hands instilling confidence back to the Spanish striker.

At Liverpool he was prolific, proving himself worthy of a £50million move to west London in 2011. He scored 65 goals in 102 appearances at Anfield, and became a fans favourite in his three-and-a-half years there.

But where did it all go wrong? Simeone will, of course, be hoping that a return to the club where it all began and where he scored 84 goals in 214 matches will ignite something in Torres, a passion that will inspire him to score plenty in La Liga.

But, for now, it seems Torres is still unable to find the back of the net.
