A cancer-stricken woman was capable of 'detailed, clear thinking' when she signed over half of her £1.2million estate to toyboy lover Michael Badmin

A cancer-stricken woman was capable of ‘detailed, clear thinking’ when she signed away half her estate to a toyboy lover nearly half her age, a court heard today.

Michael Badmin, 35, is fighting Alison Walker, 31, and Jennifer Rowan, 32, for a share of their mother’s £1.2million farm set in 90 acres near Girlinge Green, Canterbury, Kent.

The daughters claim their mother Elizabeth Walker was in a ‘delusional and irrational’ state when she signed the will and have asked a judge to tear it up.

But Professor Stephen D 
Martin, consultant general psychiatrist and neuropsychiatrist, said he 
would be ‘surprised’ if Mrs Walker had erred in her will, given the 
evidence before him.

A letter, apparently sent by Mrs Walker setting 
out her rationale for leaving half her estate to Mr Badmin, was shown to the court today.

‘It suggests detailed, clear thinking’, Prof Martin commented.

‘It might not be the fairest reasoning in the eyes of the beneficiaries, but it is logical. It is certainly not a matter of mental disorder that is driving it.

‘It does not constitute a paranoid state, depression or delirium.’

The
 note was ‘very eloquently written’ and contained a ‘richness of 
intellectual content’, Prof Martin, an expert witness, instructed by Mr 
Badmin’s solicitors, said.

Despite a request to the judge to release it, the letter was not provided to the media.

Deputy High Court Judge Nicholas 
Strauss QC said documentary evidence suggested Mrs Walker was quite 
capable of drawing up her will.

He also said of the sisters's reports of their mother's behaviour - ‘pathetic may not be the right word but somewhere near it’.

Mrs Walker died aged 53 in February 2010 from a brain tumour, barely a month after changing her will to leave half of her estate to Badmin - with the other half split between her daughters.

Mr Badmin, from Sittingbourne, Kent, was in his early 20s when he first met Mrs Walker and their relationship ‘began in earnest’ over Christmas 2005, the High Court was told.

Mrs Walker was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2009, apparently cutting her daughters out of half their inheritance at the end of that year.

Ms Walker and Ms Rowan contend their mother ‘failed utterly to engage in the process’ of making a will and relied on Mr Badmin to help draft it.

Mr Badmin insists that, despite the 
gulf between their ages, their relationship was loving and is battling 
to keep the inheritance.

His
 barrister, Araba Taylor, said Mrs Walker had bequeathed him a life 
interest in her share of the sale price of the 90-acre farm, near 
Girlinge Green, Canterbury, Kent, as she wanted him to ‘have a roof over
 his head’ after she died.

As
 well as money from the house, the rest of her estate was divided, with 
50 per cent going to Mr Badmin, now of Sittingbourne, Kent, and the 
remainder split between the sisters.

The
 pair had even wanted to get married until illness wrecked their dreams.
 ‘She always said she didn’t think it right that I should be a widower,’
 Mr Badmin told  the court.

Their relationship was ‘kept a secret’ until Mrs Walker had separated from her husband John in 2007, it was said.

Oliver Hilton, barrister for the sisters, added: ‘It was a shock to the family, given that he was exactly 23 years her junior, of similar age to Jennifer and Alison, and Timothy’s former friend.

'Nevertheless, the parties managed to get on with the new relationship and living arrangements.’

The farm was the Walker family home 
for many years until Elizabeth moved out to set up house with Mr Badmin 
following the breakdown of her relationship with her husband, after more
 than 20 years of marriage.

Mr
 Hilton explained how Mrs Walker was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 
June 2009 that caused her to endure episodes of psychosis, 
hallucinations and paranoia.

Although
 her mental condition improved from July 2009, he said she was often 
vulnerable and that her mental capacity ‘waxed and waned’ in her final 
months.

Question marks persisted over whether she
 remained ‘lucid’ in November and December 2009 – when instructions for 
the disputed will were given.

‘Mr Badmin alleges that she did and the sisters maintain that she did not,’ said Mr Hilton.

The barrister claimed that Mrs Walker ‘failed utterly to engage in the process’ when giving solicitors instructions to draft her will, and ‘very much took a back seat – relying on Mr Badmin throughout’.

Alison Walker told the court she did 
not believe her mother understood the true impact of her will, adding 
that she became ‘very off with me which she had never done in her whole 
life before she was ill’.

‘It
 changed her perception of everything,’ she said. ‘Once she had that 
brain tumour her closest family – even her grandchildren who she doted 
on – were almost like strangers.

‘She just wasn’t normal; it changed her affections.

‘She would have made provision for him, 
but I don’t think she would have made it of the kind she did, I don’t 
think she understood what the will actually meant,’ the court was told.

Deputy High Court Judge Nicholas Strauss QC said documentary evidence suggested Mrs Walker was quite capable of drawing up her will at London's High Court today (Royal Courts of Justice pictured). The trial continues tomorrow

But Mr Badmin’s barrister, Araba Taylor, maintained that the dying woman – although frail – remained sufficiently ‘on the ball’ to draw up her will, noting that she was a highly capable individual with a tight grasp of financial matters.

Mr Badmin denied suggestions that his older lover had ‘reservations about their relationship’ before she set up home with him, and that they had ‘argued a lot’.

He said: ‘It lasted quite a long time. She might have had doubts; I had my doubts – she was older than me – but if she did have doubts, they were fleeting.’

The case continues.
