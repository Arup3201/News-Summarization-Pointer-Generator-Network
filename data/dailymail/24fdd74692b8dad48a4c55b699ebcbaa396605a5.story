The augmented reality headmounted device, pictured, was unveiled in Tokyo by NTT Docomo. It uses character recognition when connected to the internet to translate text in real-time

First there were translation apps that let you speak or type in foreign words.

Then there were programs that let you hold your phone up to a word and get a real-time translation on the screen.

Now it's possible to translate foreign signs, menus and much more using just a visor.

The augmented reality headmounted device (HMD) was unveiled at the Ceatec gadget fair in Tokyo and was created by phone operator NTT Docomo.

It uses character recognition when connected to the internet and the Japanese firm claim the visor will be ready for visitors to the Tokyo Olympics in 2020.

NTT Docomo was showing off its latest developments at the show in the Chiba suburb of the Japanese city.

Its show specialised in devices where cameras,  computers and software were combined to 'give the wearer a whole different view of what they are looking at.'

One function of the HMD overlays the wearer's first language onto unfamiliar text, making signs and menus instantly understandable.

The company claim this will be of particular benefit to tourists in countries where the language uses unique alphabets or characters.

It also adds this will be most useful when looking at foreign-language menus in restaurants that don't offer translated menus to tourists, or where they serve local delicacies. 

The HMD, pictured being demonstrated at Ceatec by an NTT Docomo employee, can translate Japanese, English, Chinese and Korean languages automatically with a cloud network connected to a smartphone. The Japanese firm claims the glasses will be ready for visitors to the Tokyo Olympics in 2020

English, Chinese and Korean languages automatically with a cloud network
connected to a smartphone.

'Character recognition technology enables instant language translation for users travelling abroad and reading restaurant menus and other documents,' Docomo said in a statement, as it showcased the gadget at Ceatec Japan.

Other uses include facial recognition 
that is intended to look up someone's identity, and job title, from a 
smartphone's directory.

Another application unveiled at the event turns any flat surface into a touchscreen. It uses a finger ring and shows up icons that only the wearer can see and touch.

While a third use of NTT Docomo's 'intelligent glass' lets users 'touch' augmented reality images.
