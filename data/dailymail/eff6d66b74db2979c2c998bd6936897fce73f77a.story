A midwife accused of dumping a crying newborn in a stationery cupboard confessed to her boss ‘I have made a mistake, I’m in big trouble’, the hearing was told.

Yvonne Musonda-Malata, 35, allegedly told ward sister Martina Cheng that she had left the four-day-old infant in the storeroom and that she was in ‘big trouble’.

Musonda-Malata and colleague Christine Onoade, 46, left the youngster face down in a cot in the cupboard at Queen’s Hospital, Romford, Essex, while the youngster's ill mother was getting a much-needed night’s sleep, it is said.

A horrified nursery nurse allegedly discovered the infant on its stomach covered in vomit and suffocating at around 6.30am on April 18, 2011, the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard.

and Ms Onoade (right) are also accused of failing to record any feeds 
given to Baby A

Miss Cheng told the tribunal that Musonda-Malata came to her that afternoon and confessed to leaving the infant in the stationery cupboard.

‘On April 18, 2011, I was on the morning shift on the post-natal ward,’ she said.

‘After the afternoon handover Miss Musonda-Malata approached me and said that she had made a mistake, she appeared very upset.

Martina Cheng, today gave evidence in the hearing of nurses Christine Olukemi Onoade and Yvonne Musonda-Malata

‘She said the baby was unsettled and crying which had affected the mother, it had made her anxious and prevented her from sleeping.

‘Baby A’s father requested the baby be taken out of the room and was kept in the midwives station during the night.

‘I responded if someone was looking after the baby there was no problem.

‘She said a support worker came and said there was a problem with one of the other mothers and because of this she put the baby in the storeroom.

‘Nursery nurse Alex Curtis found the baby in the storeroom and she (Musonda-Malata) was in big trouble.

‘She said in hindsight she should have asked the support worker to stay with the baby, she said she didn’t think as things happened so quickly.

‘I said to her never do that again.’

Miss Cheng said it was usual procedure to bring a baby from the mother’s room to the nurses station to feed or change it but that a baby should never be left on its own or lying on its front.

‘In my opinion the stationery cupboard isn’t a safe place to put a baby in a cot as there is no ventilation,’ she said.

‘I don’t understand why Miss Musonda-Malata would have chosen to put the baby in there even if she did prop the door open.

‘Miss
Musonda-Malata said she had made a big mistake and was in big trouble, 
she must have been upset when she made that statement to me.

‘I can’t remember if the baby was inside the room or propped in the door.

‘I thought the baby was in the storeroom.’

Musonda-Malata and Onoade were both suspended after an internal investigation.

Midwife Yvonne Musonda-Malata leaves the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), in central London, where she is facing allegations alongside of failing to provide appropriate clinical care to a baby

They
both face a number of charges in relation to their care of the newborn,
including leaving it unattended, on its stomach and not keeping proper 
feeding records.

If found guilty of misconduct they could face being banned from the profession.

Derek
Zeitlin, the case presenter at the NMC, said yesterday: 'The baby’s 
mother has a health condition and it is vitally important for her to get
a good night’s sleep.

'Her husband therefore invited the midwives to take the baby away so that his wife could get a good night’s sleep.

'That
decision was not taken lightly. The nurse looking after Baby A’s mother
was involved in that decision. It was the right thing to do.'

Mr Zeitlin explained that the baby 
became unsettled at 'various points' throughout the night, adding that 
there was 'no specific place to put a baby' while it was looked after in
the post-natal ward.

He 
said that Ms Malata and Ms Onoade had both confirmed that Ms Malata had 
placed Baby A in a cot in the doorway of the cupboard, but claim that 
the door was kept open.

Midwife Christine Onade is accused of failing to record any feeds given to Baby A

Rita Skeats, a midwife who was working alongside the midwives that evening, said yesterday: 'The first time I encountered Baby A was at 1.30am. I went to the midwives’ station and noticed Baby A in its cot.

'I remember that the father of the baby came out of the room [where his wife was sleeping] at 2.30am, complaining that the mother could still hear the baby crying. She could therefore not sleep.

'I recommended that the baby be cared for at the nursery, but Ms Malata and Ms Onoade said they were coping OK and would keep the baby there. This decision was made jointly between the two midwives.'

Ms Skeats, who has been a midwife at the hospital since 2001, told the tribunal that she had two further encounters with the baby, when she fed and changed it.

She continued: 'When I returned [to the midwife station], Baby A had been placed in darkened section of the area. Ms Onoade was looking after the baby at this time.

'She was by the desk and Baby A was fast asleep on [its] back. We do not allow babies under three months old to sleep on their front.

'At 6am I went to the nurses’ cupboard to retrieve my stethoscope, which I keep in my bag. At this time, Baby A was still in her cot in the darkened area of the midwives’ station.

'I went to to my patients and when I returned back to the midwives station later I did not know where the baby was, but I assumed it had been taken back to its mother.

'Alex Curtis said the baby was in a cupboard and it had vomited all over itself and it was suffocating in an airless cupboard. Baby A was fast asleep and the sheets were clean. There was no vomit.

'Ms Malata told me that the baby had not been in the cupboard. She told me that Baby A had been wedged in the door way.'

An internal investigation was carried out by the hospital which found that Baby A had been overfed and there were poor records of the feedings.

Helen Mansfield, supervisory midwife who conducted a preliminary investigation, said there were no guidelines for midwives caring for babies in that situation.

Mr Zeitlin explained that the baby became unsettled at 'various points' throughout the night, adding that there was 'no specific place to put a baby' while it was looked after

She said: 'I was asked to investigate the incident, my role was to investigate the clinical care surrounding the incident.

'I looked at the guidelines on the post-natal ward and found there was no applicable policy or procedures on how to act in these circumstances.

'I discovered that Baby A had been overfed, there were no clear records of the feeding.

'I believe the baby had been overfed by the midwives.

'I concluded that there were no care issues during the incident.

'Apart from Alex Curtis not one other person saw the baby in the cupboard and it was all denied from every person I spoke to.

'If there had been more evidence of Baby A being in the cupboard it absolutely would have triggered a care issue but I had no other evidence apart from one person.

'Baby A was a well baby so there would be no requirement for that baby to have a feeding chart.

'The baby was fed although it was overfed.'

A further investigation was carried out which then led to both nurses being suspended.

Claire O'Toole, associate human resources director at Queen's Hospital, said: 'I was asked to investigate a complaint on April 20 in 2011, raised by Alex Curtis.

'Miss Musonda-Malata was the named midwife and was unable to provide satisfactory care explanation for the duration of the shift.

'There was a lack of clarity for who was caring for Baby A.

'Miss Onoade did have a significant level of involvement in the care of Baby A, she couldn't clearly outline the care when she had actually taken part in it.

'Miss Musonda-Malata engaged with the process well and was consistent but Miss Onoade was unresponsive and unwilling to engage.

'Miss Onade was reluctant to accept responsibility for Baby A.

'The incident brought the hospital into disrepute due to the publicity in The Sun.

'It exacerbated bad publicity we were experiencing as a trust, impacted on staff morale and the feelings of expectant mothers in the trust.'

The hearing continues.
