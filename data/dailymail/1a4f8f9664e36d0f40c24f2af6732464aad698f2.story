A body has been found in the hunt for a young man who went missing after he lost his job at Blockbuster, hours after his wife launched an emotional appeal begging him to come home.

John Ankers has not been seen since leaving for work on Sunday morning, and his wife Katrina Williams has spoken of her concern that he could be caught out in the freezing cold.

The store assistant had been depressed since he was told he would be made redundant after the video rental firm went into administration last week.

Today police who were looking for him found a body in woodland near a Liverpool hospital.

Campaign: Friends have put up hundreds of pictures of Mr Ankers in an attempt to find him

Mr Ankers, 28, had worked at the Blockbuster store in Birkenhead, near Liverpool, for five years before receiving the crushing news.

His low mood apparently worsened when he opened a parcel containing posters advertising the store's closing sale.

Since he left home his bank account has not been touched, and his mobile phone has run out of battery.

Police searching for Mr Akers confirmed that they had found a body near to Arrow Park hospital in Liverpool around 11am today.

Ms Williams, 27, has been informed of the discovery.

'At this stage there has been no formal identification and detectives are treating the death as unexplained,' a police spokesman said. 'Crime scene investigators are at the scene and the investigation is in its early stages.'

Devoted: Ms Williams paid tribute to her husband as 'a very happy person' with lots of friends

Depressed: Mr Ankers was said to be distraught over the impending loss of his job at Blockbuster

Earlier Ms Williams, who married Mr 
Ankers in a white wedding last September after the couple had been 
dating for eight years, said she was 'desperate' to see her husband 
again.

'We're just desperate for John to 
come home safe,' she said today. 'Nobody has heard from him or seen him 
since he set off work and we are fraught with worry - especially with 
the wintry weather.

'I have spoken to everyone who knows him and he hasn't been in touch with anyone.'

She added: 'John's a very happy person - really easy-going. Everybody is his friend and everyone loves him. That's why so many people have been looking for him.

'His disappearance is completely out of character. He's been working at Blockbusters for about four or five years but it's been a struggle financially for him.

'He said he wanted to earn more money now he's married, and he recently started driving lessons so he could have some better prospects.

'But last week he was told he would lose his job and he has been down about that. When he found out that he was going to be made redundant it was really bad.

Out of contact: Mr Ankers has not been in touch with friends or family since Sunday morning

'What made it worse was that it didn't matter how many jobs he applied for, no one got back to him.

'We're just hoping he might have gone off somewhere to clear his head. We desperately want him home safe.'

Mr Akers is described as white, 5ft 8ins tall of medium build with short, straight dark brown hair. He was last seen wearing a black jacket, white Ralph Lauren polo shirt, skinny blue jeans and black Vans trainers with white soles.

Dozens of locals have put up posters with his picture on at bus stations, cafes and factories around the area, while his friends have also started a Facebook page urging his safe return.

'We have had people out looking for John everywhere but have not had any joy so far,' said close friend Brian Granby, who is organising the search.

'We're been using Twitter and Facebook to raise awareness and the response we have had has been overwhelming.'

Blockbuster has announced that it is closing 129 of its stores around the UK, with the loss of 900 jobs, after entering administration while it struggles to deal with competition from digital downloads and online retailers.
