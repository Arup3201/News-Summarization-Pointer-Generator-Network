With her favourite squeaky toy clamped firmly between her teeth, Vegas the rookie police dog looks like she wouldn’t harm a fly.

And unfortunately that’s just the problem – she won’t.

Her fangs may look menacing enough when she snarls but she has failed to make the front line because she does not like to bite.

Scaredy-cat: German Shepherd Vegas has been rejected by Northumbria Police because she is too nervous to bite

Real-life Scooby Doo: The 19-month-old is now searching for a new home - although she is not suitable for families with young children or other dogs

Officers at Northumbria Police 
rejected the 19-month-old during a rigorous selection process because 
they feared she would be too soft on villains.

After failing her application, police dog handlers hoped that her docile nature would make her an ideal family pet.

However they then discovered she is scared of children, forcing them to hunt for an adult-only home for her.

The German shepherd was one of a 
litter of eight pups bred for police duty. She was taught to jump 
through windows, ignore gunshots and sink her teeth into knife-wielding 
criminals.

Although she passed some of the 
tests, she was deemed to be too hesitant when it came to biting. Dog 
Section Sergeant John Sim said: ‘Surprisingly, not all dogs find it 
natural to bite.

‘For a good bite the dogs have to get
 their timing right to take hold of whoever they are chasing in a 
determined and positive way and keep hold until instructed to let  go by
 the handler. Vegas was too tentative.

‘She’ll make someone a lovely pet in the right environment. She is nervous around children so would need an adult-only home.’

Anyone interested in adopting Vegas should telephone Northumbria Police kennels section on 0345 604 3043, extension 68699.
