The stepfather of a 14-year-old girl who was mauled to death by four 'hyper-aggressive' dogs burst into tears today after the pets' owner was spared jail.

Michael Anderson said he was 'devastated and disgusted' after unemployed mother-of-five Beverley Concannon was allowed to walk free from court.

Jade Lomas-Anderson was killed by the out-of-control animals in the defendant's council house in Atherton, Greater Manchester, as they tried to get hold of a meat pie.

Anguish: Michael Anderson bursts into tears outside Wigan Magistrates' Court after the owner of the dog that killed his stepdaughter Jade Lomas-Anderson avoided a jail sentence

Anguish: Michael Anderson, Jade's stepfather, is supported as he leaves the courtroom today. The family immediately walked out when it became clear Concannon was not going to be jailed

Tears: Michael Anderson said 'We have a life sentence. It has absolutely ripped us apart' after Concannon walked free today

Concannon, 45, admitted causing unnecessary suffering to the pets earlier this month after the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to charge her with manslaughter by gross negligence because of a lack of evidence.

The mother kept one of her dogs, a big American bull mastiff, in a tiny cage where it went 'stir crazy' along with two other pit bulls and and another bull mastiff which were all kept cooped up in her council house.

She was staying the night with Concannon's daughter when the dogs attacked her on March 26 - leaving her with 'horrific' injuries 'from head to toe', Wigan Magistrates' Court heard.

Armed police later shot all four dogs dead.

Pc Martin Burkinshaw, who was first on the scene after the 999 call, said: 'I will never forget what I saw.'

Concannon, who is on benefits, called her most aggressive bull mastiff Buddy her 'baby' - though it was kept 'crated' nearly all the time 
in a cage not big enough for it to raise its head or turn around 
properly.

The other mastiff Neo lived in the yard and the pit bulls Ty and Sky were confined to the kitchen.

The dogs were not walked despite there being a park two minutes from the house, the court heard.

But rather than send her straight to jail, the judge instead gave Concannon a 16 week suspended prison sentence, and ordered to pay costs and a victim surcharge totaling £165.

Jade's family immediately marched out of the courtroom in unison hissing 'disgusting!' once it became clear the dog owner was not going to prison.

Her stepfather Michael said: 'I'm devastated and disgusted in the 
justice system. Today was just about dangerous dogs. I think she should 
be held responsible for Jade.

'We have got a life sentence. It has absolutely ripped us apart.'

Paul Taylor, prosecuting, read a statement from PC Burkinshaw who said it was the most shocking incident he had dealt with in his whole career.

Victim: Jade, who was staying the night at Concannon's property, had injuries all over her body, the court heard

Dog attack: Jade Lomas-Anderson, 14, of Wigan, was holding a meat pie when the dogs pounced on her in March this year in Concannon's home

'There was a large white bull mastiff type dog in the yard,' the statement read. 'Its head and mouth were covered in blood and it was bounding around the yard.

'There was also another very large brown coloured bull mastiff type dog. It was also covered in blood, and two smaller pit bulls. They too had blood all over them.

'I felt disbelief and shocked by what had happened. I have not dealt with anything as distressing as this incident in my career and my heart goes out to this girl and her family.'

Mr Taylor said the way the dogs had been kept led to the tragedy.

Buddy, a Bull Mastiff, was one of four dogs owned by Colcannon destroyed by armed police after the attack

Aggressive: Two of Beverley's dogs in the back garden of her council house in Atherton, Greater Manchester. The dogs were never taken out for walks

A report by canine behaviour expert Annette Conn concluded all four dogs suffered chronic frustration, and physical and mental distress. It described Buddy as 'stir crazy'.

Mr Taylor said: 'Without exercise and stimulation dogs are likely to become hyper-aggressive. The defendant knows this and this is what happened with fatal consequences for Jade.'

The court heard an animal charity had offered to take one dog, Sky, off Concannon, but the defendant, who sold the bitch's puppies for £150, declined.

On the day of the incident Concannon had gone shopping, and left her daughter and Jade alone with the dogs.

The pair were in a 'dangerous situation' which should never have been allowed to happen, Mr Taylor said.

Concannon said she did not want her dogs mixing with people because she wanted them as guard dogs.

'No doubt she prized them for their aggressive traits,' Mr Taylor added.

Locals had complained before to housing and council officials about how the animals were kept and about their barking, but Concannon was allowed to keep them.

Bill Pearson, defending Concannon, said: 'She tells me she would give anything to turn the clock back.

'She has a daughter, that young daughter found Jade Anderson, her daughter will never be the same again and neither will Beverley Concannon.

'I ask you not to take a mother away.'

Passing sentence, District Judge Mark Hadfield said: 'The prosecution say the conditions in which the dogs were kept were so inadequate and was a factor contributing to their aggressive and dangerous behaviour.

'You are 45 and have no previous convictions. Through your solicitor today you have expressed remorse and condolences to the family of Jade.

'You are entitled to receive full credit for pleading guilty. You are a sole carer for your daughter.

'In all the circumstances, I have concluded that the sentence I am about to pass can be suspended.'

Last month the Crown Prosecution 
Service decided not to charge Concannon, who is on benefits, with 
manslaughter by gross negligence because of a lack of evidence.

They were also unable to prosecute 
her under the Dangerous Dogs Acts because the animals were not banned 
breeds and the attack happened on private land.

The defendant, who is on benefits, instead admitted causing unnecessary suffering to the four dogs between July 19 last year and March 25.

Scene: The attack happened in Atherton, near Wigan, Greater Manchester, in March this year
