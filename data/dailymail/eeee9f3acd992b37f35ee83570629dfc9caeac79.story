The Ballon d'Or may be the most prestigious individual prize a footballer can win, but a deeper look at the voting leaves a feeling of bemusement and frustration.   

Cristiano Ronaldo may have quite rightly been voted the world's best player on Monday night - his second consecutive win and third overall - and gushed about  Lionel Messi, hailing his great rival for helping him become a better player. 

But the Real Madrid superstar could not bring himself to include Messi in his top three players in the world, instead choosing to opt for team-mates Sergio Ramos, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema.

FIFA have published the full list of votes from each national captain, manager and media representative

Equally Messi, despite saying Ronaldo deserved to win, voted for Argentina team-mates Angel di Maria and Javier Mascherano and Barcelona buddy Andres Iniesta.

Are the world's two best players really that petty that they can't recognise the other's achievements on paper?

But let's be clear, Ronaldo and Messi are not the only ones who simply 'vote for the boys'. 

Vincent Kompany, captain of Belgium, deemed international team-mates Thibaut Courtois and Eden Hazard as the world's two best players with Arjen Robben third. No Ronaldo, no Messi, no Manuel Neuer. Really, Vincent?

Messi had Argetina team-mate Angel di Maria (centre) in his top three players in the world

Bastian Schweinsteigher (second, right) included Germany and Bayern team-mate Philipp Lahm in his three

Robin van Persie (No 9) selected Holland pal Arjen Robben (No 11) as the world's best player

Diego Godin, the Uruguay captain, opted for former Atletico Madrid team-mates Diego Costa and Courtois ahead of Robben. Again, no sign of the eventual top three. 

Germany captain Bastian Schweinsteigher went a step further, picking international and Bayern Munich team-mates Manuel Neuer, Philipp Lahm and Thomas Muller. The trio of course won a Bundesliga title and a World Cup, but did all three really outshine Ronaldo and Messi?

Unfortunately, the list goes on.

Radamel Falcao, captain of Colombia, put above everyone else James Rodriguez - of, yes, you guessed it, Colombia. Wales captain Ashley Williams opted for Gareth Bale, Robin van Persie went for Robben and Hugo Lloris deemed French team-mate Benzema the world's second-best player.

Ultimately what Monday night proved is that football is full of politicking of the highest order, arguably as bad as that seen in Eurovision.

Robert Lewandowski, for example, decided to announce on Monday that he regretted voting for Ronaldo ahead of his Bayern team-mate Neuer.

'Voting for Ronaldo instead of Neuer was a mistake,' he told German newspaper Welt. 'I would clearly vote for Neuer now if I had the chance. But I already cast my vote back in August or something. I would vote different now.

'I am sorry for Manu. I am really surprised that he did not even come in second and the big gap to Ronaldo also baffles me. Manuel is an amazing goalkeeper and person.'

We can only presume that Lewandowski had seen that his team-mate Schweinsteigher had voted for Neuer and lacked the conviction to stand by his view that Ronaldo is in fact the better player. He offers no reason as to why he had this sudden change of heart, and may be it is as simple as wanting to save face in the dressing room. 

Let's not forget that men like Lewandowski are leaders of their national teams, yet they act like teenagers voting for the prom king or queen.

Sadly, this trend extends to the managers of national teams too. Gerardo Martino went for an Argentine 1-2-3 of Messi, Di Maria and Mascherano. Yes, they reached a World Cup final but do Di Maria and Mascherano really deserve to be there? 

Colombia's Jose Pekerman picked as his No 1 player Rodriguez, Belgium coach Marc Wilmots chucked in Courtous at No 3, Deschamps gave his final spot to France striker Benzema and Holland's Guus Hiddink gave the top honour to Robben. 

Frankly, it is enough to make the stomach churn. Surely, the managers and captains of national teams should be strong enough to pick the best three players in the world regardless of nationality and friendship? 

And those that did, deserve special praise. Neymar put aside rivalries to pick Ronaldo behind his Barcelona team-mate Messi. By contrast Real's Iker Casillas found no place for Messi but had team-mate Ramos splitting Ronaldo and Mueller. 

This is no new trend and has been the norm for several years now and all it serves to do is take some of the gloss off what should be a night of celebration for football.  

Away from the political and tactical voting, there were some eyebrow-raising decisions by certain managers and captains. Here we look at the more questionable voting.
