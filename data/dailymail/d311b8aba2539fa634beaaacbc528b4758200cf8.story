Shocking new pictures have emerged showing Donetsk airport lying in ruins despite a ceasefire being agreed between Ukraine and pro-Russia rebels last month.

The truce between the two sides began on September 5, but despite the agreement, hostilities have continued in Donetsk, with the UN confirming today that 331 people had been killed since the ceasefire began at a rate of 10 a day.

One of the main battlegrounds in Donetsk has been the city's Sergey Prokofiev Airport, which has been hit by shelling during fighting between pro-Russian rebels and Ukrainian forces.

New pictures, which have emerged today, have shown smoke rising from the main terminal building at the airport, which lies in tatters.

The airport's air traffic control tower can also be seen completely gutted as the result of an artillery battle.

Donetsk airport has been the focus of much of the fighting but has no immediate tactical significance for separatist forces who are devoid of any air power.

In addition, hostilities are said to be persisting in the towns around Donetsk including Debaltseve and Schastye.

Shelling has continued in the eastern Ukraine city of Donetsk, even though a ceasefire was agreed between the two sides last month 

It was revealed today that 331 people have been killed since the truce was agreed at a rate of 10 per day 

It pictures come after the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein released a statement today saying that the security crisis needed to be tackled so residents of east Ukraine could reclaim their rights.

The organisation estimates that some five million people are being deprived of education, adequate health care, housing and employment in the area.

Mr Zeid said: 'While the cease-fire is a very welcome step toward ending the fighting in eastern Ukraine, I call on all parties to genuinely respect and uphold it, and to halt the attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure.'

Rebels and government officials regularly blame each other for the civilian deaths.

Separatist fighters have been observed firing artillery from residential areas, eliciting hasty responses from Ukrainian troops that often miss their mark and hit houses.

A separate U.N. report cites the Ukrainian government as saying more than 4,500 residential buildings have been damaged or destroyed in the fighting. 

At least 22 settlements remain without running water, while 93 settlements have no electricity, the report said.

Donetsk's Kalinina hospital has also been hit by shelling during the conflict with mortuary workers struggling to cope with the bodies piling up

Lack of proper housing is becoming particularly acute with the approach of winter, when temperatures can drop below freezing for weeks on end.

According to government information from mid-September, some 25,500 displaced people were living in shelters unsuited for winter habitation, the U.N. said.

In a separate statement, Zeid called on both sides in the fighting - largely around the industrial and coal mining cities of Donetsk and Lugansk - to "halt the attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure once and for all."

Among the dead in the conflict, at least 1,078 were Ukrainian servicemen and volunteers, according to the report, although it noted that 'the reporting of Ukrainian military casualties is imprecise and contradictory.'

Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro has blasted NATO for plotting a 'war of extermination' against Russia in a stark return to Cold War rhetoric.

He alleged that the military bloc was 'more extremist than even Islamic State fanatics'.

The retired leader's attack came as the UN revealed that 331 people have perished since a ceasefire was signed in Ukraine a month ago.

Castro denounced the 'hatred' towards Russia of new NATO leader Jens Stoltenberg, the former Norwegian premier, seen by others as more sympathetic than his predecessor towards Moscow.

'I was listening to statements by NATO's new secretary general', said the former Cuban leader.

'Such hatred in his face. What an incredible effort he is undertaking against the Russian Federation.'

Revolutionary Castro, 88, who left office in 2006 suffering from ill health, was reacting against Stoltenberg's claim that the Alliance wanted a constructive relationship with Moscow, but Vladimir Putin must reverse course in Ukraine and abide by international law.

His words came in an article entitled 'An Uncertain Future'.

Cuba is now run by his younger brother Raul.

Castro senior spoke amid fears of new anarchy in Ukraine with the ceasefire teetering on the brink of collapse.
