For anyone who has marvelled  at the ease with which the Duchess of Cambridge has taken up her  royal role, it seems the skill simply runs in the family.

Her mother Carole Middleton appeared happy and relaxed as she laughed and talked with the Duke of Edinburgh at Royal Ascot yesterday.

The pair looked entirely comfortable in each other's company, sharing a joke and swapping observations as they watched the action from the royal balcony.

Royal procession: The Queen and Prince Philip were accompanied in the first 
carriage by Sir Peter O'Sullivan, 94, a BBC racing commentator, while the Middletons followed behind in the fourth carriage

Big day: The Middletons' appearance at Royal Ascot is a clear sign of their acceptance into the inner circle of the Royal Family

Good relations: The Duke of Edinburgh and Carole Middleton share a joke 
whilst watching the Queen present the prize for the Gold Cup

All smiles: Carole was clearly tickled by what Prince Philip had to say

Ooh I say! Everyone is dying to know what Prince Philip's clearly hilarious remark could have been

Good company: Carole was flanked by Ronald Arculli, head of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and Prince Philip

Checking the form: Carole picks her horses ahead of the day's racing from the comfort of the royal box

Tense moment: Carole watches the race action with Michael by her side

On
 parade: Carole Middleton wore a crimson suit and matching hat with 
sweeping brim to join the Royal procession by personal invitation of the
 Queen

Guests
 of honour: The Middletons were in the fourth carriage, accompanied by 
Ronald Arculli, left, former head of the Hong Kong stock exchange and 
head of the Hong Kong Jockey club

Solo engagement: The Middletons attended without
 their daughter Kate, who was otherwise engaged helping William 
celebrate his 30th birthday. It was the first time the Middletons had 
attended a public Royal event without the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge

Runs in the family: The colour of Carole's dress was reminiscent of the red worn by Kate for the Jubilee flotilla

At one point, Mrs Middleton was 
evidently so tickled by Prince Philip's notorious sense of humour that 
she covered her face with her hand to try to keep her mirth under 
control.

And the 91-year-old royal, who 
appears to have recovered well after being hospitalised for almost a 
week with a bladder infection, appeared captivated by his companion.

For the second year running, Mrs 
Middleton and her husband Michael secured places in the Queen's official
 carriage procession to the race meet.

While many assumed that their 
invitation last June was a one-off event to mark the royal wedding, 
their appearance at the request of the monarch yesterday sealed their 
place at the heart of the Royal Family.

Mrs Middleton, 57, chose a pillar box
 red outfit for the event, with a matching wide-brimmed hat that was 
more than elegant enough to withstand the  scrutiny of Ascot's 
eagle-eyed fashion police.

And Mr Middleton was dapper in a morning suit and top hat, required dress for any man in the royal enclosure.

Racing fan: The Queen first went to Ascot in 1945 and has attended every year since

The Queen was entirely unperturbed by the inclement weather and laughed and joked with Prince Philip as their carriage entered the parade ground

And they're off: The Queen and Prince Philip, in fine form following his admission to hospital just two weeks ago, walk towards the royal balcony ahead of the Ribblesdale Stakes today

Each year the sovereign holds a 
week-long 'house party' at Windsor Castle, her favourite residence, to 
celebrate the historic royal race meet, inviting a small group of her 
closest friends and associates to join her.

The Middletons had a  private lunch 
with the monarch and other members of the Royal Family, including 
Philip, Princess Anne, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, at the 
castle, before taking their place in the last of the four landaus which 
made their way down the Long Walk to the Berkshire course.

Other royals present yesterday 
included the Countess of Wessex, Prince Edward's wife, who almost 
touched the ground as she executed a sweeping curtsey to the Queen – 
while Princess Michael of Kent offered a perfectly respectable 'knee 
bob'.

Following on: Princess Anne, wearing the same suit she wore for Kate and William's wedding last year, travelled with Princess Beatrice in the carriage behind the Queen and Prince Philip

Ruling the waves: The Princess Royal arriving with Princess Beatrice

Princess Beatrice looked stunning in a red and cream Erdem dress, a designer favoured by the Duchess of Cambridge, worn with nude YSL platforms and a red silk Christian Louboutin clutch

As the Queen got to work, presenting 
jockey Frankie Dettori with the Gold Cup following his win, Mrs 
Middleton could be seen happily chatting with the Duke on the balcony.

In the year that has passed since the
 royal wedding, the affection and enthusiasm the Queen has shown towards
 the Middletons has taken even seasoned courtiers by surprise.

She has let it be known that she 
thinks the family have conducted themselves 'impeccably' since the royal
 engagement was announced – despite claims that the party supplies 
business they run, Party Pieces, has cashed in on keynote royal events –
 and demonstrated her approval by inviting them to a number of 'inner 
sanctum' events.

Taking style tips from the Queen? Princess Eugenie paired her pastel suit with black accessories

Pretty in pink: Eugenie paired her Ladies Day look with a very impressive pair of Christian Louboutin heels, right

Arrivals: Princess Eugenie was in the third carriage with the Right Honourable Edward Tollemarche, godson of Prince Charles, and his wife Sophie

These include a private 'getting to know you' lunch at Windsor Castle the week before the royal wedding, as well as Ascot week.

The Duchess of Cambridge has yet to 
make an appearance at Ascot. Last year she was said  to be busy 
preparing for her inaugural royal tour to Canada, while yesterday she 
was at Highgrove with her husband Prince William, who was celebrating 
his 30th birthday.

Princess Beatrice looked trimmer than ever in a dress by Erdem, with a hat by Noel Steward and YSL cream stilettoes.
She carried a red silk Louboutin clutch bag.

Princess Eugenie wore a Paule Ka pink
 and black dress, Louboutin heels with an eye-catching silver heel 
detail and a Stephen Jones hat.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge do not plan to attend as they are 
otherwise occupied celebrating William's 30th birthday.

Prince Charles, usually in attendance
 on this day that sees the Prince of Wales Stakes run, was not able to 
attend due to a prior engagement with the Duchess of Cornwall and Aung San Suu Kyi, who is on a 10 day 
tour of the UK.

Sophie Wessex was present for the third consecutive day, dressed in a taupe skirt suit with matching hat.

In the year that has passed since 
their eldest daughter famously married into the Royal Family, the 
Middletons have been welcomed by the Queen with open arms.

Indeed the warm affection and genuine
 enthusiasm the monarch has shown towards the couple has taken even 
seasoned courtiers by surprise.

She has let it be known that she 
thinks the family have conducted themselves ’impeccably’ since news of 
the royal engagement was announced – despite claims that the party goods
 business they run, Party Pieces, has cashed in on keynote royal events -
 and demonstrated her approval by inviting them both to a number of 
‘inner sanctum’ events.

These include a private ‘getting to 
know you’ lunch at Windsor Castle the week before April’s royal wedding 
as well as Ascot week.

She also ensured the couple and their 
other children, Pippa and James, were invited to join her royal flotilla
 at the Diamond Jubilee river pageant.Kate also secured her parents 
tickets to the after show party at Buckingham Palace following the 
celebratory jubilee pop concert the following day.

Family affair: The Countess of Wessex shared a conversation with Prince Michael and Princess Michael of Kent, and the three  sheltered under large umbrellas as the weather worsened 

Mark of respect: The Countess of Wessex, her father Christopher Rhys Jones and Prince and Princess Michael of Kent curtsey and bow to the Queen as she arrives at the parade ground

The Countess of Wessex topped off her taupe suit with a stunning bow-trimmed Jane Taylor hat

What a sight! The beautifully dressed crowds at Ascot Ladies Day

Royal race: Pat Smullen riding Princess Highway won the Ribblesdale Stakes, while the Queen's filly Momentary, ridden by Hayley Turner, came in third last

The Ribblesdale Stakes was named in honour of the 4th Baron Ribblesdale, who was Master of the Buckhounds from 1892 to 1895.

When it was established in 1919, it was a one mile race open to three and four-year-olds of either gender, but after a break during World War II, the race returned in as a one and a half mile race. In 1950, entry was restricted to three-year-old fillies only.The Ribblesdale Stakes is now held on day three of the five-day Royal Ascot meeting.

The Queen's filly Momentary was today ridden by Hayley Turner who had been bidding to be the first female jockey to win a race at Royal Ascot since 1987 - Hayley was just 5 years old at the time when Gay Kelleway rode to victory on Sprowston Boy.

The last time the Queen won the Ribblesdale Stakes was in 1995 with Phantom Gold ridden by Frankie Dettori.

'She's fresh and well, there's no reason why she shouldn't win, said Hayley of the Queen's filly, Momentary ahead of the race.

It's a huge honour to be riding today. I'm hugely grateful, she added.

'It's nice to go out there into the paddock to meet the Queen. 'I've met her a few times now so we have a routine. The Queen is very relaxed, she loves talking about horses and is very knowledgeable.'
