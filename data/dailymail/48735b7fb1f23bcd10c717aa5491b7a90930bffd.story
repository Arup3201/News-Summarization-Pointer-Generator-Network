Denis Irwin has pleaded with Manchester United supporters to be patient with the team as they adapt to life under Louis van Gaal.

United began the season with an opening day defeat by Swansea at Old Trafford and legendary midfielder Paul Scholes has admitted that he is 'scared' for the club's future.

Irwin, however, believes that Van Gaal can turn things round and improve upon David Moyes' traumatic season, in which United slumped to a 7th placed finish.

'We've had 23 years of success, we need a little bit of patience,' Irwin said. 'You should not forget that we had years within that when we didn't win anything. Before the Swansea game, you could feel the optimism around the club.

'It wasn't a great performance and it was a poor result but hopefully, moving forward we can forget about that. We had a real poor year by our standards last season and I've no doubt that we will be an awful lot better this year.

'I think we have a manager who has a fantastic record of success of not only bringing players in but also using young players. He has managed some of the top clubs in the world - Barcelona, Bayern, Holland at the World Cup - he did great things with AZ a few years ago as well.'

United have recruited Luke Shaw, Ander Herrera and Marcos Rojo in the summer transfer window and the club have come under pressure to bring in further reinforcements before the end of the month.

'We have to trust the manager,' Irwin maintained. 'It is good he has bought Rojo. He's a strong boy, a good athlete, looks a good defender as well. It's fantastic that he is moving here. He knows what he wants, he's had a good look at everybody.

'He's only been in a month. He is still getting to know the players, it will take time to get to know the players and put his views across. 

'At some point over the coming year or two, we will need to strengthen but it will be down to the manager to identify that.'

Irwin, does, however believe that United must target a return to European football this season adding: 'I don't think there is any set agenda but Champions League has been part and parcel of this club for 20 years or so. We will certainly miss that.'
