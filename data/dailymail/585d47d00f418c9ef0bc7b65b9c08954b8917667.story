Six people have been charged with
providing money and equipment  including U.S. military uniforms
to foreign fighters joining al Qaeda, Nusra Front and Islamic
State in Syria and Iraq, the U.S. Justice Department said on
Friday.

The six are Bosnian natives living in Missouri, Illinois and
New York. Five of them were arrested in the United States and
charged with conspiring to provide material support and
resources to terrorists. The sixth person is overseas, the
department said in a statement.

Members of the group conspired to provide money and
equipment - including U.S. military uniforms, combat boots,
tactical gear, military surplus goods and firearms accessories -
to be used to commit crimes outside the United States, according
to a federal grand jury indictment made public by the Justice
Department.

Charged: Six Bosnian immigrants have been charged in the U.S. for allegedly supporting the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the Department of Justice said Friday (file photo)

It said people in Turkey and Saudi Arabia acted as
intermediaries who received the money and property from the
defendants in the United States and transferred them to
militants fighting with groups in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere.

The group transferred thousands of dollars over the past two
years to purchase equipment for a man identified as Abdullah
Ramo Pazara and other foreign fighters traveling to join battles
in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere, the indictment said.

In one message last year, two of the accused parties
discussed buying a night-vision optic with a built-in camera for
recording killings while fighting in the Middle East, according
to the indictment.

The indictment said members of the group used telephones and
Facebook and other social media to send and receive messages,
using fictitious names and code words including 'Lions,'
'Bosnian brothers' and 'mujahids.'

Charges: The defendants sent weapons, U.S. military uniforms and tactical equipment to a man named Abdullah Ramo Pazara, a Bosnian who traveled from St. Louis to Syria in 2013 to join ISIS (file photo)

It identified the defendants as Ramiz Zijad Hodzic, 40; his
wife, Sedina Unkic Hodzic, 35; and Armin Harcevic, 37, all of
St. Louis County, Missouri; Nihad Rosic, 26, of Utica, New York;
Mediha Medy Salkicevic, 34 of Schiller Park, Illinois; and
Jasminka Ramic, 42, of Rockford, Illinois.

All were charged with conspiring to provide material support
and resources to terrorists, and with providing material support
to terrorists. Ramiz Zijad Hodzic and Rosic also were accused of
conspiring to kill and maim persons in a foreign country, the
department said.

'Today's charges and arrests underscore our resolve to
identify, thwart, and hold accountable individuals within the
United States who seek to provide material support to terrorists
and terrorist organizations operating in Syria and Iraq,' said
Assistant Attorney General John Carlin.
