Hollywood actor Alec Baldwin has admitted that he did take his alleged stalker, a Canadian actress, to dinner but insisted the meeting was 'strictly professional.'

Genevieve Sabourin was
 arrested on suspicion of stalking  after turning up outside the 30 Rock star's 
apartment. She has now been released from jail and warned to stay away from him.

The 40-year-old was seized by police after she made the journey from 
Montreal to his Manhattan home just days after she had surprised him at Baldwin's holiday retreat in the Hamptons.

She is said to have flown into a rage after it emerged that Baldwin had become engaged to his girlfriend, yoga teacher Hilaria Thomas, 28, earlier this month.

According to the criminal complaint, 
the pair, who met on the set of a movie, dined 'briefly' together back in 2010.

Sabourin’s lawyer, Julie Sender, said at her client’s arraignment in Manhattan Supreme Court last night that the pair had a two-year relationship, although she did not say if it was sexual.

'They met. They had dinner. They had a mutual relationship, with texts, e-mails going in both directions,' the lawyer said.

A temporary order of protection has 
been issued for the actor who has denied any 'physical relationship' with her.

Sabourin’s brother, Frederick, told the New York Post, she was heading to New York to jump-start her career.

'She was going there for two to three weeks,' he said.

'I never, never, never imagined this. She’s not a freak,' he added.

Baldwin, who moved out of his 
$9.5million apartment to move in with his new fiancé last year, was 
bombarded with e-mails and text messages from the sultry actress, who 
said she loved him and wanted to have his baby.

Sabourin also told the actor, 54, she needed money, according to police officials quoted in The New York Post.

Baldwin, filed a 
police complaint after the blonde actresses' initial visit.

But Sabourin averted Long Island police and followed the star back to his apartment in New York.

And
 the actress showed up again at a screening of Last Tango in Paris at 
the city's Lincoln Center, where Baldwin attended a Q&A.

Sabourin, who has appeared in a string 
of French language films, showed up at the actor's city centre home but 
was finally arrested by police when a doorman alerted Baldwin who was 
staying in the Hamptons.

The actor notified police who arrested her on suspicion of aggravated harassment and stalking.

It is believed that Sabourin met the actor whilst working as a publicist on the set of science fiction film The Adventures of Pluto Nash, in which he played an East Coast gangster, according to sources quoted by the newspaper.

It is unknown how long the actress was allegedly stalking the actor for.

Their encounters, including an incident 
Friday night, during which she showed up at a Lincoln Center movie 
screening hosted by Baldwin, caused him to suffer 'anxiety, 
annoyance and fear', the court filing said.

Sabourin allegedly sent 'a series of 
annoying and unsolicited communications' to Baldwin after having dinner 
with him in fall 2010.

She bombarded the star with a dozen e-mails last week that he said added to his stress.

'I NEED TO START MY NEW LIFE, WITH MY NEW NAME, WITH MY NEW CARRIER IN 
MY NEW COUNTRY HELP MY NEWLY HUSBAND, YOU!' an April 4 e-mail said.

'I NEED YOU NOW, PLEASE ALEC COME AND PICK ME UP NOW. I AM LESS THAN 10 
MIN AWAY FROM YOU TONIGHT. SAY I DO TO ME,' another message the same day
 read.

She described herself as 'very weak and vulnerable' telling Baldwin she needed him desperately.

Baldwin and his Spanish-born fiancé have been a couple for almost a year.

The Hollywood star was previously 
married to actress Kim Bassinger but the pair divorced in acrimony in 
2002 after nine years of marriage and the pair were then embroiled in a 
bitter custody battle over their daughter Ireland, who is now 16.
