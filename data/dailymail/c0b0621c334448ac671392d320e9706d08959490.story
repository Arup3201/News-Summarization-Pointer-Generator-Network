Plummeting: Sterling rose above 1.40 euros yesterday to a level not seen since December 2007 – giving British families more ‘bang for their buck’ on the Continent

British holidaymakers look set for cheaper European holidays after the pound hit its highest level against the euro for more than seven years.

Sterling rose above 1.40 euros yesterday to a level not seen since December 2007 – giving British families more ‘bang for their buck’ on the Continent.

The latest surge was seen as a vote of confidence in the British economy at a time when the euro is tumbling on global currency markets.

The deepening crisis in Greece and the prospect of hundreds of billions of euros being created through a massive money-printing programme have sent the single currency crashing.

A British family now changing £500 would get 70 euros more than they would have done just six months ago and more than 120 euros more than two years ago.

Simon Philips, head of retail at travel money specialist No 1 Currency, said: ‘A tumbling euro means power to your pound. 

'British holidaymakers heading to the eurozone this Easter will enjoy rates not seen since pre-credit crunch.’

Figures from Travelex show £500 would now buy 680 euros compared with 610 euros six months ago, 589 euros a year ago and 559 euros two years ago.

The rise in the value of the pound against the euro has made everything from hotel rooms and car hire to food and drinks on the Continent cheaper for British families.

Some experts believe sterling could rise to 1.55 euros in the coming months as the British economy leaves the struggling eurozone in its wake.

David Swann, head of pricing at currency exchange experts Travelex, said: ‘The pound is clearly on a winning streak at the moment, having struck another fresh high against the euro. With the pound up 16 per cent against the euro compared to last year, it’s going to make a big difference to the Brits who are now booking their Easter and summer holidays.’

The euro has been in decline for months but the sell-off accelerated this week after the European Central Bank started printing money through quantitative easing in a bid to kick-start growth across the region.

The situation in Greece – where the new Left-wing government is struggling to win support from its European paymasters over fresh emergency funding – has also driven the euro lower.

Although a strong pound is a boon for British holidaymakers, it can hinder UK exporters by making the goods they sell overseas more expensive for foreign buyers.

Harry Adams, managing director of currency specialist Argentex, said the pound could hit 1.55 euros before the end of the year – a level not seen since mid-2002.

‘The euro bashing continues and I would be wary to predict when this will end,’ he said. ‘Investors are very wary of holding euros with the recent implementation of quantitative easing and the uncertainty over Greece. There are far safer currencies to hold such as the dollar and pound, forcing these rates higher and higher.’

The pound’s rally was not mirrored on the stock market in London where shares suffered their biggest one-day fall since October last year.

The FTSE 100 index closed down 173.63 points at 6702.84 – wiping £44billion off the value of Britain’s leading companies.

Analysts blamed worries about Greece and the wider global economy including a slowdown in China.

Speculation that the Federal Reserve, America’s powerful central bank, could raise interest rates in the world’s biggest economy this summer also hit sentiment.

Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at City of London trading firm IG, said ‘a heady cocktail of worries has sent investors scurrying’.
