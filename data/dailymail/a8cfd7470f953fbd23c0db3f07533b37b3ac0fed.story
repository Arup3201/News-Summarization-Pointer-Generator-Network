An Australian man, whose American husband of almost forty years died in 2012, made a renewed pitch on Monday for a green card after the Obama administration eased policies on gay marriage.

Anthony Sullivan, 72, asked federal immigration authorities in Los Angeles to reopen a 1975 petition filed by his late husband Richard Adams, which would grant him residency as the surviving spouse of a U.S. citizen.

Mr Sullivan and Mr Adams met in Los Angeles in 1971. They wed in 1975 after hearing about a county clerk in Boulder, Colorado, who was giving marriage licenses to gay couples.

Anthony Sullivan holds up his marriage license from his 1975 wedding to husband Richard Adams. Though the marriage license was legally issued, the couple's relationship was not acknowledged by immigration officials

The men applied for a green card for Mr Sullivan but were denied. The reason cited on the rejection letter was that: 'You have failed to establish that a bona fide marital relationship can exist between two faggots'.

After the courts shot down their appeal, they left the country and stayed with friends in Europe in the mid-1980s but soon returned to Southern California where they lived until Mr Adams died in 2012.

Mr Sullivan, who overstayed his visa, would have celebrated his 39th wedding anniversary on Monday.

The renewed immigration request comes less than a year after the Obama administration started issuing green cards to gay couples who marry.

'It doesn't matter how much time has passed and it doesn't matter how long it took to figure it out,' said immigration attorney Lavi Soloway. 'He and Richard sustained a constitutional injury for 40 years, and that should be corrected.'

American Richard Adams and Australian Anthony Sullivan were married in 1975 and applied for Anthony to get a green card. They were turned down on the grounds that their marriage was not legal

Claire Nicholson, a spokeswoman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, declined to comment on the case.

The agency that oversees immigration benefits began issuing green cards to married gay couples last year after a Supreme Court ruling struck down a law that prohibited the federal government from recognizing married same-sex couples.

Since then, Mr Soloway said he has represented more than 100 couples seeking immigration benefits related to marriage, including those whose American spouse died before they got green cards.

The difference in Sullivan's case is that his marriage predates the law, and the reason given for denying the couple's petition was simple 'bigotry and discrimination,' Mr Soloway said.

Clela Rorex, the former Boulder clerk, said she is amazed that issues surrounding gay marriage are still not resolved. She issued a marriage license to a first gay couple in 1975 after they were denied by a clerk in nearby, more conservative Colorado Springs, and the local district attorney said the law didn't bar her from doing so.

'I really want to live long enough to see marriage equality across the country and not a piecemeal thing among the states,' said Ms Rorex, who resigned after two-and-a-half years because of opposition to her decision.

Almost forty years after they were married in Colorado, Anthony has renewed his application for a green card, as the surviving spouse of a U.S. citizen
