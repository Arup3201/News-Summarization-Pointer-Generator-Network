A 22-year-old woman who was killed after being struck by a train on a level crossing is thought to have been trying to rescue her dog when the tragedy occurred.

Emergency services were called to Fisherman's level crossing between Freshfield and Ainsdale, Lancashire, just before 3pm yesterday.

British Transport Police confirmed the woman, who was from Glastonbury, Somerset, was killed on the crossing and said her next of kin had been informed.

Officers, who are still trying to establish the circumstances surrounding the death, said the incident is not being treated as suspicious.

It is understood the dog also died as a result of the tragic incident.

Residents near the crossing, which is close to Ainsdale's busy commuter station, said they believed the woman was trying to rescue her dog before the tragedy.

Kanesh Saran, who works at a newsagents in Freshfield, said: 'People say that it's a dangerous spot. Dogs can get underneath the gate and walk under it.

'That's where the problem started. She has gone through the gate to protect the dog which was on the track and then been hit - it's very, very sad.' 

Another man said: 'I went for a run and I got so far and then he said you can't go past that bit, and I had to turn around.'

British Transport Police said the incident was not being treated as suspicious and the  woman's next of kin had been informed. Services were severely disrupted in the area following the incident just before 3pm yesterday

Merseyside Police were last night speaking to witnesses, including the train driver, to establish the circumstances surrounding the death. 

A British Transport Police spokesman said: 'We were called shortly before 3pm on Wednesday August 27, following reports of a person having been struck by a train near to Ainsdale station.

'Our offices attended, alongside colleagues from Merseyside Police and North West Ambulance Service, and discovered a 22-year-old woman from Glastonbury had been struck and killed by a train.

'Her family has been informed. The incident is not currently being treated as suspicious and officers are working to determine exactly how she came to be on the tracks.

'A report will be prepared for the coroner.' 

The tragedy led to severe disruption on services between nearby Southport and Hunts Cross.

For several hours, a bus service was in operation from Hall Road to Southport while services from Hunts Cross terminated at Hall Road.
