The NYU student who mysteriously became stuck in a tight crawl space between two Manhattan buildings at the weekend spent 36 hours crying out for help and contemplated cutting off his own arm.

While Asher Vongtau, 19, is still yet to speak of his ordeal, his mother - Habiba Vongtau, who flew in from Pittsburgh to be with her son the moment she heard of his accident - said that Asher's thoughts of his family got him through the harrowing experience.

Outside Bellevue Hospital in Kips Bay - where her son will remain for an unknown amount of time after suffering a fractured skull, pelvis and arm - Mrs Vongtau said her little boy kept thinking of 127 Hours, the film in which James Franco plays adventurer Aaron Ralston, who severed his own limb to escape death.

'He began to think about the movie where the guy chops off his arm,' she told DNA info.

'He thought, ''Am I gonna have to do that?’'

Doesn't remember: New York University student Asher Vongtau, pictured, has said he doesn't remember how he became wedged between two buildings for days over the weekend. However his mother said he considered cutting off his own arm in order to get free, just like in the movie 127 Hours

Mom's here: Asher Vongtau's mother, Habiba Vongtau, pictured, traveled from the family's home in Pittsburgh on Monday to be with her son, who was rescued on Sunday evening after spending two days stuck in the coffin-sized space on Lafayette Street

'He thought about his family. He thought, ''I’m not gonna give up''.

He just yelled for help as much as he could.'

The political science major fell early Saturday morning into a narrow space between a dorm building and an adjacent building while climbing a fire escape trying to get back into his friend's room, officials said.

After a day and a half of frantic searching by his friends and school security, Vongtau was found Sunday night by a guard who discovered his cell phone on the fire escape and heard his moans, the FDNY and police said.

Emergency workers freed Asher from a tight space between a parking garage and the NYU dorm building at 80 Lafayette St, Chinatown, in lower Manhattan on Sunday night.

Crazy escape: Asher Vongtau is loaded into an ambulance on Sunday night after being rescued from an air shaft he had been trapped in for at least a day in lower Manhattan. It has now been revealed he suffered a fractured skull, arm and pelvis, among other injuries

Miracle: This is the space where NYU student Asher Vongtau spent 36 hours after falling between two buildings at 80 Lafayette St, lower Manhattan. It has been claimed drinking was involved in the fall

Rescue workers took over an hour to breach this wall and pull Vongtau out

Asher's mother said her son cannot speak highly enough of the fire officials that worked so hard to free him.

Dozens were at the scene and took just an hour and a half to breach an adjoining wall and get Asher out.

'He’s overwhelmed by the Fire Department,' Mrs Vongtau said.

'One of them came around the day I got here, yesterday.

'The minute [Asher] saw him, he was like, ‘Oh my God.’ He said those guys were like Navy SEALs.'

Despite Asher's injuries, his mother said he is doing well.

'He’s in great spirits because he knows he had no business getting out of that hole,' she said.

'It was a miracle.

'It’s an incredible story, really.'

Lucky to be alive: Asher Vongtau, 19, right, fell from the NYU dorm building, left, sometime on Saturday and was trapped in a tight space until Sunday night

'He really can't remember up until when 
he fell in there, exactly what happened, maybe as he comes to,' Mrs 
Vongtau said.

'(He has) broken bones, arm, and contusions, and 
cracked, I think fractured pelvis.'

The NY Daily News reported police sources saying Vongtau had been drinking when he fell.

He reportedly went out on a fire escape, scaled a railing and tried to reach a nearby ledge when he slipped, falling down into the space where he would spend the next 36 hours.
