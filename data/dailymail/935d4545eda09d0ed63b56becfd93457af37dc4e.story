Stuart Lancaster selects his squad for the autumn internationals on Wednesday, a huge moment which will set the tone for next year’s World Cup. It’s his most important squad selection yet. Will he announce a squad geared to attack or stay true to his mantra and favour a more conservative approach?

Selection is an art, not a science. As head coach it is the No 1 skill you require. You stand and fall by it. Selection reflects the coach’s mindset both to his own team and to the opposition. Do not underestimate how closely Lancaster’s opposite numbers will look at this announcement.

Watching Australia v New Zealand at the weekend, you see that they’re so committed to running the ball and making their passes, even from deep. I believe attacking, high-speed rugby has its place more than ever. I really hope England go for it this autumn, put an emphasis on attack and produce a team sheet that inspires the nation and asks questions of the opposition.

One of my litmus tests for selection was to imagine waking up on match day. Are you going to be really excited about your England team? Can you get 82,000 people on their feet going nuts? It must be based on playing at a pace as no team can live with that. It must be a team geared to scoring tries. This is not easy, but you only get one chance to be in the hot seat. Attack.

Looking over my time with England there are selections I’m really proud of — the tough calls I got right. But there’s others I got wrong, and those ones still wind me up today. Here are the principles that guided my selections.

1 CAN THEY SHINE ON THE WORLD STAGE?

Test match and World Cup rugby is way above European or Premiership rugby yet when naming squads you are often judging current form at club level. This takes real skill, and often it comes down to backing your gut, especially when introducing a player to the international scene if more obvious candidates exist. It’s tempting to pick players from winning teams but this can be too simplistic.

There can be some absolute gems playing in losing teams. Dan Luger’s raw speed and execution in the final third stood out for me and he once started for England the week after he’d been dropped to the Harlequins second XV.

Worcester’s Chris Pennell will be fascinating here. England have spotted something exceptional — will they continue to back Pennell now he is playing Championship rugby? Danny Cipriani was brilliant against Munster at the weekend even though Sale lost.

Chris Pennell is now playing Championship rugby - will England still back him?

 2 FOCUS ON ATTACK

You can always work hard to bring your defence up to scratch whereas if you pick strong defensive players first it’s not so easy to transform them into an attacking threat.

For years people told me I had the balance wrong in my preferred England back row — Richard Hill, Neil Back and Lawrence Dallaglio.

They said I was effectively playing three openside flankers. But I didn’t care. They were our three best ball-in-hand attacking options in the back row and they developed into an awesome defensive unit as well.

To attack you must pick two real ball players at 10 and 12. I would love to see Cipriani play with Owen Farrell, that would be my choice if England really want to attack.

3 REACT TO MISTAKES

In elite sport you have few chances to make mistakes. I got some selections wrong. I wished I’d played a second fly-half at inside centre in Paris in 2002 to take the pressure off Jonny Wilkinson.

I didn’t and Wilkinson could barely breathe that day with Serge Betsen all over him. In the following year’s Six Nations Charlie Hodgson started alongside Wilkinson at 12 and in the 2003 World Cup semi-final Mike Catt took Mike Tindall’s place.

4 KEEP GAME PLAN IN MIND

When playing two good kickers at 10 and 12, as I often did, it made sense to have wings like Ben Cohen, Luger and Josh Lewsey who were great in the air so they could get on the end of crossfield kicks.

Good kicking out of hand is attacking rugby. England have a lot of talent at 10, but they don’t have any 12s who can kick. If Cipriani and Farrell played 10 and 12, you could have a back three of Mike Brown, Semesa Rokoduguni and Marland Yarde.

5 USE WORLD-CLASS KICKERS

Playing with relentless pace will force the opposition into giving away penalties so you will always need what a world-class goal-kicker provides: touchline conversions, penalties under pressure and drop goals.

You need back-up in this area. Could we have won the 2003 World Cup without Jonny? I would like to think so. Because we had Paul Grayson in the squad who, while not Jonny’s equal in goal-kicking, was certainly next in line.

Farrell is a world-class goal-kicker, but who is the 85 per cent kicker if he is injured?

England do not appear to have a back-up kicking option in the same class as Owen Farrell

Stuart Lancaster must make the big calls

6 SOLID TIGHT FORWARDS

Your front five must be proven ball winners. You must have 100 per cent scrum possession on your ball and a minimum of 85 per cent on your own line-out throw. And you must be rock solid at restarts. New Zealand showed this at the weekend; their re-start play is phenomenal. Forwards who can guarantee you that get priority over others who might possess a more eye-catching all-round game.

7 THE COACH MUST DECIDE

The buck stops with the head coach. Of course you should canvass the opinion of your senior coaches but this has to be your squad, your moment in time. It will be the coach’s head on the line if it goes wrong.

8 NO COMPROMISE

Nothing should stop you fielding the team you want. I was very excited to see the wheels in motion for Steffon Armitage to move into the Premiership and make himself available for England selection.

He should be eligible for selection regardless of where he plays. I applaud the RFU and Bath in bringing Sam Burgess into Union and I’d love to see Sam Tomkins change codes as well.

In 2000 I decided to do everything I could to get Jason Robinson and Henry Paul. One of those punts came off spectacularly.

9 FIND YOUR GUN XV

Select your starting First XV, your ‘Gun’ XV and make sure everybody knows it. If the overall culture, spirit and ethos is good it will be win-win in terms of generating internal competition.

Those with the shirt will be aware they are the players to be toppled; the ‘reserves’ will be hungry for selection.

10 WARRIOR TEST

Regardless of who and where we were playing, the ‘warrior test’ was a key criteria for me when it came to selecting my starting line-up.

Could this player handle facing New Zealand in Auckland or South Africa in Johannesburg? They must be able to think correctly under pressure.
