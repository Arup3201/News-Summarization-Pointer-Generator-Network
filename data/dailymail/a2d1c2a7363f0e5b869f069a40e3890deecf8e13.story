It is a sight that will have birdwatchers licking their lips with glee.

But if enthusiasts find themselves thinking this scene of frenzied feeding is too good to be true, well, that's because it is.

The busy photograph is in fact a montage, compiling numerous visits by different birds to a feeder over a 20 minute period.

Feeding time: A range of birds, including the blue tit, coal tit and chaffinch pictured visiting a feeder at Stover Park near Newton Abbot in Devon

The impressive collection of birds was photographed at Stover Park near Newton Abbot in Devon.

The compilation reveals the animals in their various guises, with some perched on the multi-entrance feeder and others spreading their wings in flight as they go to-and-fro.

Included in the picture are the blue tit, coal tit, great tit, chaffinch, nuthatch and bullfinch.

The photograph was released by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds as part of their Big Garden Birdwatch, now in its 34th year.
