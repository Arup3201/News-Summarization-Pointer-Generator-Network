Colour, music and dancing filled the streets of Badajoz, Spain, on Sunday for the annual and ancient city festival.

Members of comparsas, or troupes, dressed in flamboyant costumes and make up entertained the cheering crowds as they performed throughout the day.

And it wasn't just the adults of Badajoz, close to Spain's border with Portugal, who were part of the show - children, too, took part in the celebrations.

Some performers' costumes at the Badajoz festival appeared to be inspired by outer space

Children joined in the fun too, some dressed as Edward Scissorhands (left) while flamenco dancers and matadors also wowed the crowd

It might have been a traditional Spanish festival but some of the costumes were Russian themed

While some were dressed as feather-covered dragons, complete with exotic face paint, younger members of the community were decked out as Edward Scissorhands, the ghost-like character made famous by Hollywood superstar Johnny Depp.

Other costumes were inspired by flamenco dancers, clowns and little drummer boys. One troupe even had a Russian theme, complete with models of Red Square on their hats.The common thread, though, was colour and extravagance.

The whole town, together with residents of towns throughout the province of the same name, spend months making the costumes and practicing musical performances for the Group Parade.

Monday night transforms in to a giant street party until a sardine, represented by a puppet, is buried to signify the beginning of Lent on Wednesday and the end of the celebrations - until next year.

Colour - and plenty of make up - was the order of the day for this Latin-themed group of performers
