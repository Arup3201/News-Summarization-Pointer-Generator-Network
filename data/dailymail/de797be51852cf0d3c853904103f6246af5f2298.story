A high school footballer who died after collapsing during a game told his father 'Tell mom I love her' just hours before the tragedy, it was today revealed.

Tom Cutinella, 16, was playing as a linebacker for Shoreham-Wading River High School against John Glenn High School when he was injured during a tackle.

He was raced to Huntington Hospital on Long Island, where he underwent emergency surgery for a brain injury. But despite medics' best efforts, he later died. 

He was the third teenage footballer to die in five days following the deaths of cornerback Demario Harris Jr. and linebacker Isaiah Langston.

Today, Mr Cutinella's father Frank revealed his son's heartbreaking final words to him as he ran toward the school bus. 

He explained how the teenager had forgotten his No. 54 football jersey, so he had had to hurry out of their Long Island home to give it to him.

'I threw the jersey at him and he caught it and said, "I love you Dad". He always said "I love you" to his family before going to school each morning,' the father of four told Newsday.

'But his mom was still in the house. Then he gets halfway to the bus, turns around and says, "Tell Mom I love her." That was the last message he gave us.'

He added that his son, who was running for junior class president alongside his football teammate Jason Curran, was an honors student who 'loved to give'.

'He always said, "Dad, you know I'm a giver",' he said. 'And he's still giving. I'm at the hospital right now and they are harvesting every possible organ of his that they can.' 

Mr Cutinella collided helmet-to-helmet with a Glenn player while blocking during the third quarter of the game. Shoreham's head coach Matt Millheiser described the smash as 'a big hit.'

The player, the eldest of four siblings, then stood up and tried to walk off the field after the incident, but collapsed several feet from the sideline.

Meanwhile, school board member Jack Costas said the community was 'devastated' by Mr Cutinella's death.

He said: 'It's always tragic when someone so young and so full of life has their life ended. It's going to be a very, very difficult road ahead from this.'

He added that the school was expecting to get a full report into exactly what happened.   

In the past couple of days, Mr Cutinella's friends and relatives have taken to Facebook to pay tribute to the footballer.

In the second of the three football deaths, Mr Harris Jr. of Charles Henderson High School in Troy, Alabama, died on Sunday after collapsing on the field Friday following a tackle.

Meanwhile, Mr Langston of Rolesville High School in North Carolina died on Friday after collapsing during pregame warm-ups. 

Although he did not know the official cause of death, Mr Langston's brother Langston told Fox NYC that it was related to a blood clot in the brain.

There are about 50 to 100 sudden deaths among athletes in middle, high school and college every year,  Dr. Marlon Rosenbaum, associate clinical professor of medicine and pediatrics at Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons told CNN.

Dr. Roosevelt Gilliam, cardiologist at Healthcare Medical Group in Jonesboro, Arkansas, said the most common cause of sudden death among young athletes ishypertrophic cardiomyopathy, when the heart is thickened and enlarged.

This problem can be detected by an initial ECG screening, followed by an echocardiogram (an ultrasound of the heart) for diagnosis. 

People with it should generally not participate in competitive athletics or other strenuous activities, Mr Gilliam said.
