Europe last night imposed the toughest sanctions against Russia since the Cold War, sending the rouble into a tailspin and prompting warnings that British firms will be hit hard.

EU leaders agreed unanimously to embargoes against vast sectors of the Russian economy, designed to cripple its banks, energy firms and defence capabilities.

Russia will face sweeping new sanctions in response to its alleged support of rebel militants in east Ukraine.

Russian president Vladimir Putin: Russia faces sweeping new sanctions from both the U.S. and the EU

The 28-nation bloc has imposed an arms embargo, banking curbs and a ban on trade in sensitive and dual-use technologies to punish Russia for its actions in its neighbouring country.   

Two diplomats told the Associated Press the measures were decided today at a meeting of EU ambassadors. A further eight Russians will also face asset freezes and travel bans. 

The new EU sanctions came as John Kerry, U.S. Secretary of State, warned that Washington is also drawing up fresh sanctions against its old enemy. 

'We are in the process of preparing additional sanctions, with Europe,' Mr Kerry told reporters, shortly after meeting with new Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin at the State Department.

But he added that Russian President Vladimir Putin 'still has a choice going forward with respect to his ability to be able to have an impact with the separatists.'

Europe's arms embargo will block any trade with Russia in weapons or 'related material'. With its own major arms industry stemming from the era of Cold War isolation, Russia has little need to import weapons from the EU, but sells more than 3billion euros worth a year to member states. 

However, the embargo will apply only to future contracts, so one big deal that won't be affected is the heavily criticised 1.2billion-euro sale of two French helicopter carriers to Russia, which has already been agreed.

The EU's banking curbs are a more significant step. They will deny Russia's state-owned banks access to European capital markets by banning Europeans from buying their bonds, equities or financial instruments with a higher maturity than 90 days. 

Last year nearly half the bonds issued by Russia's state-run financial institutions were traded in the EU's financial markets, according to The Guardian.

AFP reported that Mr Kerry also revealed he had again raised concerns over Russia's role in stirring unrest in eastern Ukraine during a telephone call Tuesday with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov.

Russia has denied supporting the separatists, but Mr Kerry maintained that he and Mr Lavrov had 'agreed that there is a way to try to put some very specific proposals on the table to try to move forward.'

Over the weekend, U.S. officials released what they say are images of Russian artillery firing from inside their country on Ukrainian military positions.

'President Putin can make a huge difference here if he chooses to, and we and our European partners will take additional measures and impose wider sanctions on key sections of the Russian economy if that is what we must do,' Mr Kerry said.

'We hope that it will not be necessary. And if Russia continues to go down this path, however, Russia will leave the international community with no choice.'

Mr Kerry again pointed out the difficulties being faced by international investigators trying to gain access to the site where a Malaysian airliner was downed 10 days ago, killing all 298 people on board.

'Without this access, they have no way to collect debris, no way to collect other evidence from the scene in order to be able to provide the kind of examination that is necessary,' he was quoted as saying by AFP.

'They still can't even ensure that all of the victims' remains have been removed, and that is an unsupportable burden for any family to have to bear, and it is an unacceptable standard for behaviour.

'The site has to be cordoned off, the evidence has to be preserved, and Russia needs to use its considerable influence among the separatists in order to be able to help ensure this basic approach of common decency.'

As Mr Kerry spoke, shells smashed into a residential neighbourhood of Donetsk as Ukrainian forces intensified their campaign to encircle the rebel stronghold. 

The shelling killed at least two people, blew gaping holes in an apartment block and raised fears that the city is on the verge of severe bloodshed.

Fighting also raged elsewhere in Ukraine's troubled east, bringing the death toll to at least 24 civilians and 10 soldiers over the past day. And it prevented international investigators once again from visiting the site of the Malaysia Airlines jet shot down earlier this month.

The increased danger to civilians has brought sharp criticism from the United Nations and human rights groups. But the Associated Press reports that each side blames the other for shelling residential areas.

The rebels insist the attacks are evidence of what they describe as the government's indiscriminate oppression of its own people. But Ukraine insists that it has banned the use of artillery in residential areas and in turn accuses separatists of targeting civilians in an effort to discredit the army.

The Donetsk shelling sent about 50 frightened residents to huddle for safety in an underground parking lot, including Lubov Skorikh who was distraught at discovering that her husband Vladimir had been killed.

'I ran out. ... An old woman told me, "Look, there is a man lying there." I didn't even think that could be my husband. But then I saw the shoes; they were his shoes," she tearfully told an Associated Press reporter. 'Do you understand? His shoes! My God, I lived with him for 45 years; he was such a good person.'

In Horlivka, a city besieged by government troops, the mayor's office reported Tuesday that 17 people, including three children, were killed as a result of shelling.

The mayor's office said there has been major damage to many homes and government offices in the centre of the city. It also said the top floor of a school was destroyed as a result of a direct hit from a shell.

A U.N. monitoring mission in Ukraine says there has been an alarming build up of heavy weaponry in civilian areas of Donetsk and Luhansk - including artillery, tanks, rockets and missiles that are being used to inflict increasing casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure.

The U.N. said in a report this week that use of such weaponry could amount to a violation of international humanitarian law.

'There is an increase in the use of heavy weaponry in areas that are basically surrounded by public buildings,' said Gianni Magazzeni, head of the UN office that oversees Ukraine. 'All international law needs to be applied and fully respected.'

New York-based Human Rights Watch has been more categorical in its accusations against the government and last week produced what it said was evidence the army had fired on houses in the suburbs of Donetsk. 

The overall death toll has been steadily rising. The U.N. has said that at least 1,129 people were killed between mid-April, when fighting began, and July 26.
