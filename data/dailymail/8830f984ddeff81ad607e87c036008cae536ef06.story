Virgin trains are to continue running on the West Coast mainline until 2017, five years after Sir Richard Branson was supposed to lose the right to operate Britain’s biggest stretch of track.

Ministers today admitted they have torn up the timetable for awarding a dozen lucrative franchises after unearthing systemic failures in the way multi-billion pound bidding competitions were handled.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin also revealed plans to put the East Coast main line back into private hands, after it was nationalised by the Labour government in 2009.

More delays: In an attempt to finally get a grip on the multi-billion bidding process to run Britain's railways, it was announced Virgin trains are to run the West Coast line until 2017

Unveiling an overhauled franchise process today, Mr McLoughlin confirmed a series of delays to stop a repeat of the debacle over the West Coast line.

The contest to run South Eastern services has been put back from April 2014 to June 2018 while the Great Western franchise, run by FirstGroup and due to end in October this year, will not start until July 2016.

The Northern franchise, due to end in April 2014, will not begin until February 2016. The first of the new franchises to start will be Essex Thameside, where the franchise ends in May this year and will begin in September 2014.

Details of the new franchise timetable reveal a string of delays

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin put the brakes on the entire contracts process after discovering 'significant flaws'

The decision-making process about 
which firms run the nation’s railways were plunged into chaos last 
summer when ministers announced that Virgin had lost the West Coast 
franchise.

FirstGroup was awarded the £13billion, 13-year deal in August but Virgin launched a legal challenge.

As
officials prepared for the High Court proceedings, ‘significant 
technical flaws’ in the contract competition were unearthed.

In 
particular major mistakes were made in the use of inflation and 
passenger numbers, with different firms given different data. Three 
civil servants were suspended and the deal was halted.

With taxpayers facing a compensation bill of up to £100million, Mr McLoughlin initially asked Sir Richard to continue running services until early 2014 but today the government admitted a new operator will not now take over until 2017.

It was the chaos surrounding the West Coast deal which triggered two independent reviews - one on the West Coast fiasco and the other on the whole franchise process.

Rail minister Simon Burns said he was confident the new contest would be 'cock-up free'.

He told BBC News: 'We have learnt the lessons of past mistakes with the West Coast Mainline and so that we can move forward.'

Passenger Focus chief executive 
Anthony Smith said: 'The time for passenger power has come. For too long passengers have been the passive recipients of major decisions made on their behalf behind closed doors.

'The voice of the user - and main funder - of the railways should be radically boosted in a process that needs to be opened up to scrutiny. We are going to work with Government to make this a reality.'

Today's announcement is the direct result of the reviews and effectively sets the franchise process back on track.

Maria Eagle, Labour’s shadow 
transport secretary, said: 'The full scale of the chaos caused by the 
Government’s rail franchising fiasco has now been revealed with almost 
every contract delayed by up to a staggering fifty months.

'Ministers have still not come clean 
about the full extent of the losses facing taxpayers as a result of this
scandal, despite many industry experts putting the likely cost at well 
over £100 million and a series of legal disputes yet to be settled.'

The announcement is a fresh boost for Sir Richard Branson's Virgin trains, just months after being told it had lost the bidding war

In a statement to MPs, Mr McLoughlin 
said: ‘This programme is a major step in delivering tangible 
improvements to services, providing long-term certainty to the market 
and supporting our huge programme of rail investment.

‘Above
all, in future franchise competitions we are placing passengers in the 
driving seat by ensuring that their views and satisfaction levels are 
taken into account when deciding which companies run our railway 
services.

The move to return the East Coast mainline to private hands ends the modern experiment in the government running services for the first time since the privatisation of British Rail.

In
2009 National Express walked away from the East Coast Main Line 
franchise, and the Labour government took control of services.

A new government-owned company, Directly Operated Railways, was created and has run the services ever since.

It recorded a seven per cent rise in profits to £7.1 million in 2011-12. In the four weeks to August 19, 93 per cent of East Coast trains were on time up from 87 per cent on 2011.

The four-hour Flying Scotsman express 
service from Edinburgh to London (pictured) was reinstated and extra services to 
Lincoln and Harrogate were introduced.

The
apparent success of the state-running of services caused the RMT 
transport union to call for the same to happen on the West Coast line.

DOR overhauled the East Coast timetable, introducing almost 20 new weekday services.

But ministers have now announced it will be run by a private company from February 2015.

‘Franchising has 
been a force for good in the story of Britain's railways, transforming 
an industry that was in decline into one that today carries record 
numbers of passengers.’

In a surprise move, the government hopes to put the East Coast line back in private hands in less than two years.

The line - a key London to Scotland 
route - has been run under the control of the Department for Transport 
since November 2009 after transport company National Express pulled out.

Mr
McLoughlin announced the ‘immediate start of the competition’ for the 
East Coast franchise with an expected start of service by the new 
operator in February 2015.

Rail
unions reacted with dismay to the East Coast news, pointing out that 
the private sector had twice given up the franchise, with GNER pulling 
out some years ago.

They 
also highlighted the fact that the taxpayer is likely to have to foot a 
bill as high as £50 million over the botched West Coast franchise.

RMT general secretary Bob Crow said: ‘Despite wasting hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money on the franchising circus, and instead of learning the lessons of the privatisation disasters on the East and West Coast main lines and across the rest of the network, the Government has this morning given the green light to a whole new wave of profiteering that will have the train companies laughing all the way to the bank.

‘The proposed reprivatisation of the East Coast, after the public sector rescued the service following two private failures, proves conclusively that the political class have learnt absolutely nothing when it comes to our railways.

‘This is a politically-inspired wrecking move designed to flog off this publicly-owned intercity route before the next election regardless of the consequences.’

Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail
union, said: ‘The Tories are just like the Bourbons when it comes to 
rail - they ignore all the lessons of history.

‘The
£50 million West Coast line fiasco revealed that private franchises are
a shambles. So they go and privatise the only successful publicly-owned
franchise, the East Coast line.

‘This
is an act of political spite to reward their friends in the City and to
tie the hands of an incoming Labour government in 2015. The most 
expensive rail network in Europe is about to get even more expensive.’

The West Coast debacle pitted Virgin Trains against FirstGroup against each other, with Virgin emerging as the main beneficiary of the delays to awarding the £13boillion contract

TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady, who chairs the Action for Rail campaign said: 'This decision defies all logic. Since returning to public ownership the East Coast Mainline has flourished with passenger numbers and customer satisfaction increasing and all profits re-invested back into improving the service.

'The government, however, is not interested in evidence-based policy and is once again putting the interests of private companies and shareholders before those of commuters and taxpayers.

'This is privatisation for privatisation’s sake, as ministers steadfastly ignore what is best for the rail industry and the people who work on it and use it.'
