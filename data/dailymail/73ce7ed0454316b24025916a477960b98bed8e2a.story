A woman who claims Bill Clinton groped her in the White House is lashing out at his wife Hillary for conducting a 'war' on the women who have accused the former president of sexually assaulting them.

'She enabled his behavior,' Kathleen Willey said Sunday night during a radio interview on WABC in New York, and then 'attacked all the women who just made the mistake of walking in front of him, crossing his path.'

Willey claims Mrs. Clinton, the former U.S. secretary of state, has orchestrated a series of investigations designed to discredit the many women who have claimed her husband sexually assaulted them.

'The point is what this woman is capable of doing to other women while she's running a campaign, basically, on women's issues,' she said. 'It just doesn't make any sense.'

'She singlehandedly orchestrated every one of the investigations of all these women.'

Willey said the president groped her after she approached him for a paying job in the White House instead of her volunteer position

She suspects Hillary Clinton of covering up 'nothing short of serious sexual harassment' in her case.

And addressing claims by some Democrats that Republican politicians are conducting a so-called 'war on women' through their social policies, Willey turned the notion on its head.

'Hillary Clinton is the war on women, and that's what needs to be exposed here!' she exclaimed.

WND.com first reported that Willey told WABC host Aaron Klein that Mrs. Clinton is 'addicted to power, and she saw early on that [Bill] could be a powerful candidate. He had a lot of charisma. And she could just ride on his coattails.'

Talking about the her allegations against Bill Clinton, she reiterated Sunday that 'the president sexually assaulted me,' leading her to 'the little room where he and Monica [Lewinsky] used to meet.'

'I started to go for the door and he was right behind me,' she recalled, 'and things went from bad to worse there. He acted just very inappropriately. He just did. I was shocked and bewildered, and I thought to myself, "What in the world is he doing?"'

Willey claims Bill Clinton, an old friend whose Virginia campaign organization she and her husband founded, 'was very intense. He's big. He's much bigger than I am.'

Following Willey's news-making allegations in 1998 on the CBS program 60 Minutes, the Clinton White House released a series of letters and phone messages, sent after the alleged 1993 sexual harassment, which seemed to show Willey had a friendly outlook toward the president, and wanted more contact – not less.

A federal judge later ruled that President Clinton had 'committed a criminal violation' of the Privacy Act by making her letters public. He was not prosecuted for it.

And Linda Tripp, a one-time friend of Clinton paramour Monica Lewinsky, testified in a grand jury proceeding that Willey pursued Clinton, and not the other way around.

But Willey maintains that she was a victim, and has even claimed the Clintons had her second husband murdered on November 29, 1993, the same day the president allegedly forced himself on her.

The death was ruled a suicide, but she said Sunday that twenty years later government agencies refuse to let her see files detailing the investigation.

Willey was a prolific Democratic fundraiser who co-founded Virginians for Clinton to help get him elected, but she would later turn on him after what she says was a sexual assault near the Oval Office

The botched Benghazi terror-attack aftermath isn't the only hurdle between Hillary Clinton and the White House: Foreign powers may believe she can be deceived and fooled because her husband was a serial cheater

Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, an all-but-certain presidential contender, said in January that although Bill Clinton's presidency was marked by 'predatory behavior, it's not fair to blame his wife for letting it continue.

'It’s not Hillary's fault,' he told Vogue magazine, 'but it is a factor in judging Bill Clinton in history ... sometimes it's hard to separate one from the other.'

Willey had no problem focusing her venom on Hillary, though. It's her likely presidential candidacy that's bringing the former president's sexual flings back into the news.

'Just pack your bags. You’ve had your 15 minutes,' she slapped at Hillary. 'Stop forcing us to have to look at this stuff again. We're sick of it.'

But Willey also had harsh words for feminist groups that seem insistent on making Mrs. Clinton the first female U.S. president.

'All of these women's groups, they're all pro-Hillary,' she said. 'They need to ... talk to someone like me and listen here, what Hillary Clinton has done to me and many, many, many other women.'

'They are so hypocritical, it's unbelievable,' she claimed. 'And this is the woman that wants to be president.'
