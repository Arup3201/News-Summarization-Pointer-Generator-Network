He was discovered by Andy Warhol at 17, has photographed everyone from Angelina Jolie to Michael Jackson and even our very own golden girl Kylie Minogue, and now he's Down Under.

Acclaimed photographer David LaChapelle, who famously shot the Kardashian Christmas card last year, was in Sydney this week to take part in a new campaign which aims to get people to connect with the environment around them.

In a series of photographs shot over two days, the artist swapped his camera for his smartphone and presented his take on the Land Down Under - to be displayed in an online photo gallery.

American Express have brought LaChapelle to Australia as part of their #MySecretOz campaign, which urges commuters to get away from the 'urban auto-pilot' and instead get Sydneysiders to see their spectacular city in a new light.

From the bright lights of Luna Park, the glittering seas at Seven Shillings Beach and a spectacular sunset over the city skyline LaChapelle explored Sydney in a new and spectacular light. 

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia shortly after he touched down in Sydney, the photographer said he couldn't wait to spend time in the 'unique' 'mixed city'. 

The bright lights of Sydney's Luna Park will also feature in the online photo gallery, launched on October 21

The spectacular views from the cliff-tops of North Head impressed the famous photographer, who told Daily Mail Australia he planned on visiting the site

'I can't get over the architecture and I love the fact it's not so hectic like LA with the traffic. 

'(And) I'm really amazed - I didn't even know about the beaches,' LaChapelle said speaking of the close proximity of the seaside to the city. 

The photographer revealed he didn't really have a plan for what he was going to shoot, but rather would go exploring and see what caught his eye.

'It's good, it's a challenge - I often think things out a lot before I do them,' adding he was looking forward to 'coming here totally fresh and not knowing much.'

When asked about sites that had taken his fancy so far, LaChapelle said a certain spot at the other end of the Sydney Harbour Bridge caught his eye.

'I love Luna Park, I just saw it for the first time ... I thought it was one of the most amazing things'. 

'There's a few (other) places on my list that I just want to check out, and one of them is the North Head cliffs, they're dramatic and beautiful', LaChapelle said. 

Being one of the greatest influences in pop culture over the past few decades, the photographer took on the epitome last year when he took the Kardashian's Christmas photo at the end of last year.

'It was a real lesson in modern anthropology', he said.

LaChapelle added that shooting the famous family was 'a real reflection of where we are as a society today.'

'The idea in my head was this future Las Vegas Mall and the casinos, and in America we have all these malls that are failing and losing a lot of money.

'It's the apocalyptic idea,' LaChapelle revealed. 

'There were 600 million comments worldwide about that photograph.' 

As for the MySecretOz campaign, its all about getting people to stop and smell the roses.

'MySecretOz is about encouraging people to reconnect with the beauty that surrounds us every day, American Express Australia Managing Director, Rachel Stocks said

This intricate tree in Nielsen Park, Vaucluse, captured the eye of the photographer who was armed with nothing but a smartphone for the shoot

'In an increasingly fast-paced world we often end up stuck on ‘autopilot’, failing to take notice of the inspiring places and moments in our day-to-day environment. MySecretOz will serve as a visual reminder that the world is full of vibrant experiences worthy of our attention.' 

LaChapelle’s MySecretOz gallery will launch on the American Express Facebook page on Tuesday 21st October 2014.  

Social media users can snap their own photographs of the stunning seaside city of Sydney and share them with the hashtag #MySecretOz over the course of the next month which could end up in the crowd-sourced online gallery.
