Queen Maxima of the Netherlands was every inch the royal style icon as she stepped out in a bright plum ensemble as she attended an agricultural event in Utrecht today.

The Dutch royal, 43, wore a voluminous blouse and A-line skirt  as she smiled and waved at onlookers while making her way inside the building.

She accessorised her outfit with a purple bangle, bold gold leaf necklace, patent nude clutch bag and court shoes.

Maxima had a windswept, relaxed hairstyle and simple make-up with glossy lips and a bronzed complexion.

The Argentina-born queen's glamorous look was for the symposium 'From Tradition To Ambition' hosted by Dutch Agricultural Youth (NAJK). 

Once inside she was invited on stage to be given an investigation report from chairman Eric Pelleboer, and she was delighted to receive it. 

Upon her exit, a smiling Maxima stopped to collect a bouquet of white flowers and shook hands with bystanders before being driven away.

Earlier this month the queen embarked on a three-day tour of South Korea with husband Willem-Alexander. 

The royal couple are among the youngest - and newest - monarchs in Europe, with Willem-Alexander taking the Dutch throne last June.
