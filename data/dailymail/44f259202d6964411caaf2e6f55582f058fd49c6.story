A 10ft Burmese python was found crushed to death under a tree blown down in high winds.

RSPCA officials are investigating the death of the snake, found in a park in Northfleet, Kent, on Wednesday by alarmed dog walkers.

The reptile had a head injury - but it remains unclear if the wound was suffered before being hit by the tree.

Officers say it is possible the snake was killed and then left at the scene by a cruel owner.

An RSPCA spokesman said: ‘Somebody will be missing a 10ft Burmese python and we want to find out who.

‘Further examination of the snake has led to some question as to whether the crush injury it sustained to the head was a result of the tree or whether the injury took place prior to being placed under the tree.’

Nobody has yet come forward to claim ownership of the snake.

Average Burmese pythons grow to between 12 and 13ft - although some can reach 25ft and females are usually larger than males.

The snakes are normally found in the marshlands, swamps, grasslands and woodland of southern and south-east Asia, and can prove deadly.

The RSPCA spokesman added: ‘A snake of 
this size could easily crush a child. A fully-grown one would have the 
capability of seriously injuring or even killing a fully grown adult.

‘It’s their crush instinct that’s particularly dangerous.’

Burmese pythons are a brown colour with distinctive black, green and tan markings.

Despite the potential danger, the creatures - which eat birds, small mammals and rodents - are popular as pets because of their appearance and normally docile manner.

They can live for 20 years or more. The largest Burmese pythons can weigh as much as 250lbs.

The Guinness World Record for the largest snake in captivity was awarded in 2011 to Medusa, a reticulated python measuring 25ft 2in in length - which was a pet in Kansas City, United States.

The 10-year-old snake required 15 men to hold her at full length in order for her record measurement to be taken.

The sub-tropical species is one of the five largest in the world and normally found in south-east Asia - but has become a popular pet among reptile enthusiasts in the UK.
