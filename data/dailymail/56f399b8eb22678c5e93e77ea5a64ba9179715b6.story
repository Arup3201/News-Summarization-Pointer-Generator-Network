Days before she was named Miss Congeniality at the Miss Lewis County Scholarship Pageant in Centralia, Washington, Chloe Curry was accused of attempting to shoplift cosmetics from the Chehalis Walmart.

Police said the 18-year-old from Adna and another 18-year-old attempted to leave the store on March 6 with lip balm, nail polish, fake eyelashes, fake nails and other beauty products worth more than $100 in their purses. Both were cited.

Three days later, Curry was named Miss Congeniality at the pageant, her looming court date unbeknown to pageant judges.

The Chronicle reports pageant judges were unaware of the incident before Saturdayâ€™s competition because she used a name different than her legal name.

'It was a stupid mistake,' Curry told King 5 News.

'We thought we could get away with it and we didn't.'

However, she says that she's genuinely sorry for her actions, not because she got caught.
