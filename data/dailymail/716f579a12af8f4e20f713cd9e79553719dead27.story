Republicans always enjoyed leaving Nevada Sen. Harry Reid bandaged and bruised during touch legislative fights, but they never thought they'd see him like this.

Reid returned to the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday after missing the first two weeks of the new congressional session with major injuries from an exercise-related accident. 

The liberal stalwart, derided by Republicans as 'Dingy Harry,' broke several bones in his face and fractured some ribs when an exercise machine failed on New Year's Day, hurling him headlong into cabinets at his new house in Nevada.

Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada returned to Capitol Hill in Washington on Tuesday, welcomed with cheers by fellow Democrats, but won't be up to attending Obama's annual speech

CRUSHED: Reid has broken bones in his face and fractured ribs, suffered when a piece of exercise equipment failed and sent him barreling into cabinets at his new house in Nevada

He sported an eye bandage as he walked the Capitol's halls, telling reporters that his right eye is 'doing better' and he's feeling 'not bad.'Reid's fellow Democrats greeted him with a round of applause.

Reid, 75, is the Senate minority leader and spent the last six years leading a Democratic majority before it evaporated in November's elections.

He has already pledged to run for a sixth six-year Senate term in 2016, despite being banged-up.

His office distributed a photo of him Tuesday morning on Twitter, showing the senator sitting at his desk and sporting an eye patch, with nothing to cover the remaining bruises on his face.

Reid aides told the Associated Press that he won't attend President Barack Obama's State of the Union speech.

His spokespersons told reporters on Jan. 2 that he would be at work in Washington a few days later, following treatment at University Medical Center in Las Vegas. That return ended up taking weeks longer.

'Senator Reid will return to Washington this weekend and be in the office Tuesday as the Senate prepares to reconvene. His doctors expect a full recovery,' their statement said 18 days ago.

But as of Jan. 9, he was still housebound – and talking about the possibility of losing sight in his right eye.

His recovery 'isn't anything that is a slam dunk,' he told Las Vegas public radio station KNPR. 'I had a serious injury in my eye. There was some blood accumulation there and they’re hoping it resolves itself.'

'I think I've done a good job directing my crew without me actually being physically present at the Capitol,' he added.

WALKING WOUNDED: In previous accidents, Sen. Harry Reid dislocated his shoulder and had a rain-slicked slip-and-fall while jogging

Reid is no stranger to bumps and bruises – not political metaphors but the physical kind.

He dislocated his shoulder and bumped his forehead in May 2011 when he slipped and fell during a morning jog in the rain.

Reid leaned on a wet car near his home in Washington, D.C.'s Ritz-Carlton hotel and tumbled to the ground.

That fall left him with a contusion just below his left eye, but he was back in action later that night at a fundraiser for California Sen. Barbara Boxer. 

Shortly after his accident nearly three weeks ago, he began taking meeting with fellow Democrats at his home in Washington. 

'Most people know I fought [boxed] for a couple of years,' he said during one such meeting.

'After any one of those fights, I never looked like I do now.'
