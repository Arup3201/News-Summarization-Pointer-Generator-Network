An average Joe might be able to hold the plank for up to a minute while others would be lucky of making it to four before crumpling over in defeat.

But a Chinese policeman, from Beijing, has recently smashed the planking world record with a staggering four hours and 26 minutes.

Mao Weidong planked his way to the Guinness World Record for the longest time in an abdominal plank position on September 26.

The plank is designed to sculpt a flat stomach, strengthen the entire core, provide support for the entire body in everyday movements, reduce back pain and improve posture. 

The footage shows the 43-year-old with his elbows bent 90 degrees and the rest of his weight on his forearms on the ground, forming a straight line from his head to feet while clenching his hands.

Weidong is seen holding his position on a podium in front of spectators, while he is dripping sweat from every part of his body.
