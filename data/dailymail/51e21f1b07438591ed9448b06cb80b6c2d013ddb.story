The maker of Edward Snowden documentary CITIZENFOUR refused to travel to the film’s UK premiere last night because she fears arrest under the Official Secrets Act.

Laura Poitras said she had been advised by lawyers to avoid travelling to Britain because her work with the fugitive former contractor with the National Security Agency.

Snowden is living in Moscow with his girlfriend Lindsay Mills after he was granted asylum by Russia to escape charges of espionage in the U.S.

Poitras spoke from Berlin via patchy Skype videolink to the packed first public showing in Britain of CITIZENFOUR at the Curzon cinema in Chelsea, west London.

Skype is owned by Microsoft, one of the very Internet companies accused of allowing the NSA ‘backdoor’ access to its customers communications and data.

‘It’s because of the laws of the UK, the UK Terrorism Act and the Official Secrets (Act), that make publishing this kind of work very dangerous for journalists,’ she said.

‘I’ve just been advised by my lawyer don’t go to the UK and that’s why I’m not there.’

Poitras said reporter Glenn Greenwald, who published the first stories from Snowden’s leaks, information security journalist Jacob Applebaum, and Sarah Harrison and Julian Assange from WikiLeaks had all also stayed away on the basis of legal advice.

Assange is in Britain but technically not in UK territory since he is holed up at the Ecuadorean embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden to face questioning over alleged sex crimes.

Poitras is a U.S. citizen, but is now living in Berlin after complaining of repeated stops by U.S. border authorities when travelling into her country. 

MailOnline contacted the Home Office for comment on her claims she feared arrest if travelling to the UK, but none was available at the time of reporting.

CITIZENFOUR takes its title from the email alias that Snowden used when he first approached Poitras in early 2013 through a series of encrypted emails - with a view to leaking details of the NSA’s top-secret surveillance assets to the media.

Marketed as a 'real-life thriller,' it is the first of several films in the works about Snowden, who is wanted by the U.S. on charges brought under the Espionage Act.

Speaking to the UK premiere last night, Poitras claimed the 30-year-old computer systems analyst had no interest in becoming a celebrity. 

‘He said “I don’t want to be the story.” And I said, “You know what? Even if you don’t want to be, you will be the story because the Press works like that.”’

Snowden's revelations sparked a global debate on the limits of privacy versus the needs of national security. His critics view him as a traitor who refuses to face trial in the U.S. for his actions, while supports see him as a hero who spoke up for civil liberties.

A top spy last week revealed how Snowden's leaked documents have made the job of monitoring terrorists far more difficult.

Sir Iain Lobban, the outgoing head of the British government's NSA equivalent, GCHQ, revealed that since the revelations it now takes three times as long to complete routine monitoring tasks.
