Dallas Cowboys defensive end Jack Crawford spoke of his excitement at playing in front of his friends and family when the Londoner’s side take on the Jacksonville Jaguars at Wembley on Sunday.

Crawford, initially keen to pursue a career in basketball, attended Penn State college after moving across the pond in 2005. He was picked up by the Oakland Raiders in the fifth round of the 2012 NFL Draft, and signed for Dallas before the start of the current season.

The 26-year-old has played four times for the NFC East team this campaign, and is eagerly anticipating appearing in front of a home crowd.

‘It’s amazing [performing in front of your family],’ said Crawford, speaking at the Cowboys' training base at Saracens’ Allianz Park.

‘Only my brother’s ever seen me play before, so for me it’ll be a special experience to play in front of so many of my friends and family who try to keep up with me over here. It’ll be the experience of a lifetime.

‘Man, I’ve got about 30 people coming to the game – people just think the tickets are free! I’m going to spend time with them, with my family, and try to see them as much as I can while I’m here.’

Having spent his formative years in the English capital, Crawford knows exactly what to expect. It appears some of his team-mates, however, haven’t been so impressed with the city’s characteristic weather so far.

‘For people who haven’t been here before, London is a hard city to adjust to, especially at this time of year,’ he continued.

‘Personally, I think London has the worst weather in the world. We got here yesterday and it was 50 degrees Fahrenheit and wet, so they [his team-mates] got to see the real London.

‘Not too many people have liked it much so far, but it takes time to grow on you and I think everybody’s handled it well. We’re here to do a job so you don’t really get to experience London like you would on holiday.’

The Cowboys’ meeting with the Jaguars represents the third game in the NFL’s International Series to be played at Wembley this year, after visits from Miami Dolphins, Oakland Raiders, Atlanta Falcons and Detroit Lions earlier in the season.

All three matches have been played in front of capacity crowds, and Crawford explained why he thinks the sport has gained such a following in the UK.

He said: ‘You can see it’s grown as a cult, and now it’s getting bigger in the UK. I’ve seen the fan base grow immensely over the past 10 years since I’ve been in America.

‘Once you learn the rules it’s so exciting to watch, if you don’t know the rules it’s just start stop, start stop – it’s boring! For me it’s the most entertaining sport to watch.

‘Some people over here say it’s soft because we wear so much equipment, but it’s different to rugby because that’s more of a side-to-side game whereas American football is head-on so you need the equipment, otherwise your career will only last a couple of weeks.’

Crawford’s Cowboys head into Sunday’s game off the back of two straight losses – to divisional rivals the Washington Redskins and the Arizona Cardinals last Sunday – but he claims they will have no special plans for the Florida-based outfit.

‘At this organisation we don’t really go out of our way to prepare for certain players or certain schemes,’ Crawford explained. ‘We really just practise what we do over and over and over and focus on what we have to do.

‘We keep mentioning it’s about us, it’s about forming an identity, and we don’t really worry so much about the other team. And that’s why we get success.’
