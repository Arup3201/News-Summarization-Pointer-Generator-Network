A fireball engulfed a packed commuter train after it collided with a fuel tanker in Indonesia - killing 10 and injuring 80 passengers.

Emergency workers fought to drag survivors from the burning and twisted wreckage of the disaster just south of the country's capital Jakarta.

Police are investigating claims the truck accelerated into the path of the oncoming train, thought to have been carrying 600 people, while attempting to skip closing barriers of a level crossing.

The train was travelling at 43mph split seconds before the collision, according to authorities.

'The first and last carriages on this 
train were for women only, so it was the first carriage that collided 
with the truck,' Sukendar Mulya, a spokesman for state-owned train 
company Kereta Api Indonesia, told AFP. 

The
truck accelerated and drove onto the tracks just as the gate was coming
down to halt traffic and let the train pass, Mulya said.

Investigations
were under way after the accident shortly before lunch at a crossing in
the suburb of Bintaro, southwest of Jakarta, police said. The truck was
destroyed in the blaze.

'One
of the railway crossing gates malfunctioned. A railway officer had 
tried to stop the truck,' said Dedi Arnadi, head of police for the area,
told reporters.

Both the carriage and tanker flipped 
on their sides following the crash at a level crossing and caught fire, 
sending thick plumes of smoke into the air as passengers jumped off the 
train and fled.

The 
train company estimated that around 600 passengers were on board when it
slammed into the truck on the southeastern fringes of Jakarta.

Forty-year-old Ira, who goes by one name, was in the carriage that hit the truck.

'I felt the strong crash and panicked, so I forced my way out a window and just ran,' Ira told AFP as she broke down in tears.

'I was outside when I heard an explosion... and saw the truck and carriage on fire,' she said.

Jakarta deputy police chief Sujarno confirmed that five people were killed but other passengers were safely evacuated.

'There were also young children hospitalised with injuries,' he said.

It was one of Indonesia's worst train 
accidents since 1987 when 156 people were killed when two trains 
collided, close to the scene of Monday's accident.

A
list displayed near the crash site showed more than 80 people had been 
hospitalised.

An AFP correspondent at the scene saw several burns 
victims being taken away in ambulances.

Nine people were being treated for serious injuries, Jakarta police spokesman Rikwanto said, suggesting the death toll may rise.

Rikwanto
said the train sounded its horn several times before hitting the truck,
which was unable to get out of the way as it was stuck in traffic 
behind a motorcycle.

'The 
train hit the truck from the back left and propelled it around 65 feet 
forward before they both flipped,' Rikwanto said, adding that police 
were questioning seven witnesses.

Isnadi, a senor official at Kereta Api Indonesia, said the safety gate was in working order.

'The warning alarm sounded for at least five minutes before the train arrived. The train was travelling at 43 miles an hour when it hit the truck,' Isnadi told state-run news agency Antara.

Local media reported that an engineer and a technician from the driver's compartment were among the dead.

In the early evening, a team was seen trying to tow the derailed carriage with another train that had arrived at the scene.

The tanker was owned by state-owned company Pertamina, which has assisted with the evacuation.

Train accidents, especially at crossings, are common on Indonesia's ageing and poorly maintained railroad network.
