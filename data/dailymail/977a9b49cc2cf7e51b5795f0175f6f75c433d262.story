Romelu Lukaku's £28million transfer to Everton from Chelsea is worth every penny, according to Toffees manager Roberto Martinez - who believes he can develop into the world's best striker.

The Belgian international joined the Goodison Park outfit for a club record fee after excelling on loan there last season, signing a five-year contract that will be worth around £70,000-per-week on Wednesday.

The 21-year-old scored 15 goals in 31 
Premier League appearances for Everton as they finished fifth last 
campaign, and Martinez believes the price they have paid for the young 
striker will prove dividends in years to come.

'I do think it is a key moment at our club,' he said.

'I am looking at that No 9 position and he is potentially the best choice in world football. In years to come you will see him develop into someone special.

'His transfer fee will not count for anything in terms of him developing.

'This dressing room has a special feeling. It is not about how much you pay for players to come in, it is about selecting the players to be in there.'
