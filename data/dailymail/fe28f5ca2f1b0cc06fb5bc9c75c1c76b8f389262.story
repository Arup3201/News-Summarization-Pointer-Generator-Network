It has survived two world wars and seen five monarchs rule Britain.

The country's oldest postbox is still in use after 161 years, and still bears the initials of Queen Victoria.

The red box has been given a new lease of life after locals in Holwell, near Sherborne in Dorset decided it needed a makeover.

The unusual octagonal design was commissioned in 1853 before it was made by John M Butt & Co, of Gloucester, just a year after roadside pillar boxes were first introduced.Â 

Chris Loder, West Dorset district councillor, asked Royal Mail to give the box some attention at the end of last year.

He said: 'The Barnes Cross post box is an icon of the village with huge historical significance.

'It is unfortunate that Royal Mail has let the post box get into a poor state, but I was very pleased that it responded so promptly when I asked for it to be refurbished.'

Roadside pillar boxes first appeared in 1852. Since then there have been hundreds of different varieties bearing the ciphers of six reigning monarchs.

Up until standardisation in 1859 each area had a different designs for its postboxes.

The postbox still bears the initials of Queen Victoria, who was on the throne when the box was first introduced in 1853
