A French city has been made to scrap plans to force homeless people to wear yellow triangle ID tags after they were compared to Nazi-era Star of David badges.

Authorities in Marseille wanted beggars to wear the badges, which would have carried information such as their personal details and any health issues, so they could be easily identifiable.

But the proposals provoked outrage across France from human rights groups and even government ministers with some comparing the badges to the Star of David Jews were forced to sew on to their clothes during the Nazi era.

The six-pointed yellow star was forced upon the Jews by Nazis in the Reich to wear to mark them out.

French group La Ligue des droits de l'Homme said they were troubled by the badge and its resemblance to the yellow star that had to be worn by Jews.

While social affairs minister Marisol Touraine told Le Parisien newspaper: 'Forcing homeless people to carry a yellow triangle indicating the illnesses they might have is outrageous. You don't point the finger at the poorest.

The plan provoked outrage with human rights groups and even government ministers comparing the ID tags to the Star of David badges Jews were forced to wear in Nazi Germany 

Earlier this week demonstrators gathered outside the City Hall of Marseille to protest against the plans, which were eventually dropped today

'You don't write their illnesses on their clothes. Medical confidentiality, in particular, is a fundamental right. I want this local initiative to be stopped.'

Demonstrators also gathered outside the City Hall of Marseille to protest against the badges which they said were discriminatory.

They held up signs and placards with one reading '1933-1945 Never Again', with the yellow triangle and Star of David emblem next to it.

Council officials had tried to defend the plan saying they were only to help emergency services if they have to come to the aid of a homeless person.

Over 100 of the cards had also been distributed around the city.

But today, council of France's second largest city, bowed down to pressure and announced that they would be scrapping the plan.

The head of the social and medical emergency services SAMU Sociale René Giancarli told The Local: 'It’s finished. There won’t be any more cards.'
