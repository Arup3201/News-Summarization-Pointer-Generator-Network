Angel di Maria has revealed former Real Madrid team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo told him to wear the No 7 shirt at Manchester United due to it's significance at the club.

Di Maria, who has penned a five-year contract at the club worth £200,000-a-week wages, has been handed the iconic shirt worn in the past by club legends Ronaldo, Eric Cantona and David Beckham.

The Argentina international was unveiled at the club's official press conference on Thursday and remarked how it was Ronaldo who told him the importance of the jersey.

'Cristiano told me what the No 7 shirt meant. I wanted to wear this shirt. The club wanted me to wear it,' Di Maria said.

The 26-year-old also revealed his desire to restore Manchester United to the Champions League following his £59.7million plus add ons move from Real Madrid on Tuesday.  

'I'm very pleased to be at Manchester United, I like the team and I wanted to come here even though there is no Champions League football this season,' he added. 

'I want to help them reach the Champions League again. I'm very pleased that Louis van Gaal chose me to come to Manchester United.

'Manchester United have already won many trophies and are a very big team. I came here to help them raise their game and win many more trophies with them.

'The fee does not bother me, the fact £60m is paid that is for the chairmen to negotiate. I come to play for the club and do my best for them.' 

Di Maria's arrival to Old Trafford is the club's fourth signing this summer following Luke Shaw, Ander Herrera and Marcos Rojo - taking their spending past £131m.

Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal believes the signing of Di Maria is a coup that will improve his struggling squad.  

United have yet to win a game this season, losing their opening Premier League game of the season 2-1 at home to Swansea before drawing 1-1 at Sunderland on Sunday.

The Red Devils early campaign woes hit a new low on Tuesday when they were thumped 4-0 at League One outfit MK Dons in the Capital One Cup but Van Gaal believes the Argentine will prove beneficial to the club's philosophy.

'I'm pleased we have such a class player in the squad. We have many class player but its important he's a team player. That's what I like about Di Maria. He can accelerate the game for us but also play for the interests of the team,' van Gaal said at the unveiling of Di Maria.

'That's why we've chosen this player and I hope he will give us good results. We cannot expect after two days training that he is the miracle. No, you have to work for the miracle and he knows that.

'I only buy players that can improve our philosophy. I have spoken about his way of playing in the interests of the team. And he can accelerate our playing style. But he fits our philosophy.

Where Di Maria will feature in van Gaal's preferred 3-5-2 starting line-up is unclear but the Dutchman believes the 26-year-old's versatility means the winger will be equally adept in defence and attack. 

'I think he will be a player who can enjoy defence. That’s also a reason we have chosen him. When you see his answers. He is a very modest guy. He wants to work. He showed that last year. He played 52 matches and gave 22 assists. How many players can say that? You are a social human being. And in the football world that is not always the case,' he added.

'I can change the system with him too, which maybe we will do in the future - just like I did against Swansea. He played at Real Madrid not only as right wing but also in midfield.'
