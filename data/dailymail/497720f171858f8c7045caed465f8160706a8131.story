Brave tornado survivor Stephanie Decker has danced on national television just two months after being told it would be a year before she could even walk again. 

The mother who lost parts of both legs while protecting her children in the March 2 tornadoes that ravaged Southern Indiana, walked out onto the Ellen DeGeneres show to cheers from the packed studio audience.

Mrs Decker spoke about the challenges of her recovery but there was a lighter moment when DeGeneres asked her 'will you dance with me?' and the pair boogied to the Maroon 5 song Moves Like Jagger.

In an emotional interview she told how she held on tightly to her children as the house fell down around her.

'It really was an instinctual thing. I looked out and saw weather I did not recognize and I knew that things were going to be bad. I just had that gut feeling.'

'My kids were playing on an iPad and playing on the middle of a mattress in the basement.'

Mrs Decker, 37, lost one leg above the knee and the other foot protecting her 8-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter as the storm flattened their 'dream home' in Henryville, Indiana on March 3

'I took 'em and went to a part of the basement that I thought maybe would be safer and instantly windows started bust out of our home and I just wrapped them up in this blanket thinking debris may hurt them, tied 'em in it and just laid my entire body on them.'

Mrs Decker, 37, lost one leg above the knee and the other foot protecting her 8-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter as the storm flattened their 'dream home' in Henryville, Indiana on March 3.

Her selfless act, which saved her life and the lives of her two children, has inspired many.

'The pain was excruciating. It felt as if a blow torch on the lower half of you extremities. It was extremely painful but I just could not display that pain in front of those kids.'

Her husband Joe and kids Dominic and Reese joined Stephanie on the program to talk about their ordeal.

DeGeneres aired a video message from Justin Bieber who invited Reece and her family to see him in concert.

'I heard about what your family has been going through and what a huge help you have been to your mom. You are an amazing girl and have an amazing family,' Bieber said.

Ruins: The home was reduced to a pile of rubble by the 175 mph storm that flattened much of the town

Mrs Decker has spoken out previously, saying that she remembered how uncertain she was about the impending disaster that she filmed a message on her mobile phone to her husband, telling him she loved him.

'I assumed I was safe and I heard the roar like a train, and I heard it behind me, and I knew it was coming,' she told ABC News.

'And it was so loud that I knew that I needed to do something different. I knew staying put wasn't going to work.'

Happy family: Stephanie was surrounded by her family at the hospital, including her husband Joe (left), son Dominic (center right) and Reese (right)

A mother's love: As soon as the storm passed, Dominic, 8, ran to a neighbor's home for help

'They were screaming, "Mommy, I can’t live without you! I don’t wanna die, please don’t let me die!" and I said, "you’re not going to die, we’re going to make it".'

Then she realised she had been badly hurt, with her leg appearing as if it had been severed. She also suffered seven broken ribs and a punctured lung.

'I knew it was bad. If I didn't get help soon, I was going to bleed out,' she added to ABC News.

Knowing his mother was hurt, it was Dominic's turn for bravery. He crawled out from under his mother and ran to a neighbor's house.

'After Dominic left, I realised I couldn't get out because I actually used the comforter I tied with them as a tourniquet. I knew I was cut,' she said.

One neighbour, Brian Lovins, a Clark County Sheriff’s officer, used his belt to create a tighter tourniquet and drove her until he could flag down an ambulance, which took her to hospital.

Fears: Mrs Decker was so worried she was going to die as a result of her injuries that she filmed a video on her mobile phone for her husband Joe, pictured, to tell him she loved him

Saved: Mrs Decker protected her two children, eight-year-old Dominic (L) and five-year-old Reese (R)

Her husband, Joe Decker, tearfully said that the flattened house had been their dream home.

His wife had said she always wanted to have the children's handprints imprinted in the foundation's cement, because 'we were never gonna leave here'.

The small prints, with the 'Reese' and 'D' for Dominic, remain scrawled in the concrete.

Mr Decker said: 'What I told her was: "You’re alive and you get to see your kids grow up".'

The home, which was partly built by Mr Decker and his wife's father, is now completely destroyed, with a bathtub 200 feet away in a nearby field.

Gone: The house 'took about nine months to build and about four seconds' to fall, Mrs Decker said

Remaining strong: The children's hand prints can still be seen in the home's foundations

Henryville was nearly entirely flattened by a series of tornadoes that ravaged the South and Midwest on Friday March 3, killing 39 and leaving thousands homeless.

The Decker’s inspirational story is one of the few from that fateful day, which saw deaths in Alabama, Georgia. Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio, with Indiana and Kentucky particularly hard hit, with 13 and 21 lives lost respectively.

Destruction: The Decker family home was just one of the hundreds destroyed by tornadoes in Indiana. Damage can be seen in nearby Marysville which was entirely wiped off the map by the severe weather
