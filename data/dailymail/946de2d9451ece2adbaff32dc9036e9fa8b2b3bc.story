An overweight woman who needed three people to help her onto a theme park ride was so humiliated she lost seven stone.

Nicole Whitehead weighed 18st when it took three members of staff at Alton Towers to get her to fit into the ride, Air, safely.

The 23-year-old, from Spondon, Derbyshire, was so mortified that she decided to transform her life and went from a size 24 to a size 10.

Transformed: Nicole Whitehead used to weigh 18st, left, but an embarrassing day at Alton Towers made her change her ways and she dropped seven dress sizes

Mortifying: It took three members of staff to help Nicole onto the flying rollercoaster ride, Air

Nicole said: 'It was very embarrassing because it was a very busy time and I was quite young. I felt mortified to have three people trying to get me in. All the people around me on the ride also looked very embarrassed for me.

'It ruined the day completely because I just wanted to go home. I didn't go on any rides after that. It could have been avoided if I'd not put the weight on and got so big.'

Diet overhaul: Nicole used to snack on crisps and chocolate but she's banished her belly now she eats healthily

It wasn't just at theme parks where Nicole's weight was an issue - it was also damaging her health.

She had to go to A&E twice because her size restricted her breathing, which led to panic attacks.

She also admits her weight affected her self-esteem.

She explained: 'I had no confidence at all. I used to get very stressed when shopping for clothes. I would just feel awful and I was not living the life of somebody my age.'

She added: 'I was living in denial. I didn't think my size was bringing on the health problems when it obviously was.'

Confident: The auditor's self-esteem has soared since her weightloss

It was the mortifying experience at Alton Towers that finally gave her the push she needed to change her ways.

Nicole, who works as an auditor, began attending Slimming World classes and overhauled her bad eating habits for healthier options.

She said: 'I used to have a few rounds of white 
toast with full-fat butter for breakfast. Now it's still toast, but wholemeal bread 
with cereals as well.

'At lunch I
 would eat a lot of sandwiches and other rubbish. I'd also snack a lot 
on crisps and chocolate. Now I'm much more organised. I'll have a jacket
 potato with rice and salad.'

Proud: Nicole is delighted to have lost 7st through healthy eating

BreakfastBefore: A few rounds of white toast with full-fat butterNow: A slice of wholemeal toast or cereal

LunchBefore: Sandwiches with crisps and chocolate Now: Jacket
 potato with rice and salad

TeaBefore: Roast dinner cooked with full fat oilsNow: Healthier roast chicken dinner made with low calorie cooking spray and lots of vegetables

She lost 11lb in her first week on her weight loss plan and nine months later, reached her target weight of 11st 2lb, bringing her total weightloss to almost 7st and dropping seven dress sizes.

Now she's full of confidence and can visit theme parks regularly without fear of an another embarrassing experience. She's even found a new hobby by taking up scuba diving.

Nicole said: 'After what happened at the theme park, I was so proud to be able to go scuba diving. I now feel amazing compared to what I used to be like and I'm so pleased with the achievement.

'I feel loads better about myself and I've got my confidence back. I can go out with my friends and have a good time, feeling comfortable.'
