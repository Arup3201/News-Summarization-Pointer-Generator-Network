Frank Lampard's preparations for the new season continued on Thursday as he trained with his Manchester City team-mates for the second time.

The veteran midfielder has penned a six-month contract with the Premier League champions ahead of starting his Major League Soccer career with New York City next year.

And the 36-year-old looked determined to get himself fully fit for the Community Shield clash with Arsenal this Sunday during an intense session at sunny Carrington.

Lampard was pictured taking part in a number of drills with the rest of Manuel Pellegrini's squad after being welcomed by England team-mate James Milner.

Although he will hope to be involved at Wembley, Lampard will miss the final game of his contract - against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge - as he does not want to risk upsetting his former club's fans.

He'll have no such worries this weekend when Pellegrini's men aim to start their season with a trophy by beating FA Cup holders Arsenal.

Lampard enjoyed plenty of success against the Gunners during his time at Stamford Bridge and he'll be keen to begin his brief City career with by winning the season's first silverware.

One man who has been left saddened by Lampard's move to the Etihad is Chelsea skipper John Terry, who has admitted that it does't 'feel right' to see his former team-mate in City's colours.

Terry told ChelseaTV: 'I felt lost the first few days (of pre season). At Cobham Lamps is next door to me and Ash (Cole) is a couple up.

'We've grown up together and won and lost here at Chelsea and done many great things so I was very sad to see them go.

 'And to see Ash already sign for Roma and Lamps has signed for New York... It doesn't seem right to me seeing them in different shirts. Maybe over time that will ease but it doesn't seem right.'
