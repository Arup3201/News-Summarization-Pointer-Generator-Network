Randi Zuckerberg, the sister of Facebook founder Mark, has complained that her privacy was breached on the social networking site when one of her photos was taken and shared on Twitter. 

Randi posted a picture of her family jokingly reacting to Facebook's new Poke application, and someone Tweeted the picture out to the public. 

Incident comes as Facebook has long been accused of taking advantage of user's privacy concerns, so the fact that one of their own family members felt the sting of an open social network comes as a late Christmas present to the company's critics.

In the photo, Randi's younger siblings and parents are seen in what appears to be their family home in Dobbs Ferry, New York.

Breach: Randi Zuckerberg posted a photo of her siblings joking in their family kitchen on Christmas day, and she thought that since she was sharing it with only friends it would not be published

Mark is standing in the corner- wearing his trademark hoodie sweatshirt and a bit of a smirk- while the other Zuckerbergs looks aghast at their cell phones, presumably mocking the latest update to the social networking application.

The new version of 'pokes' allow users to send fleeting messages, pokes, photos and 10-second videos to friends.

The messages expire after a set period of time, from 1 to 10 seconds, and cannot be retrieved by either party again, making it perfect for sending salacious images without leaving a trail.

Randi might have wanted to employ a similar self-destructing device for this photo, since she is now furious that it has been made public.

Backtracking: Callie Schweitzer saw the photo because she is Facebook friends with Randi's younger sister Arielle who was tagged in the photo

A journalist and recent college graduate named Callie Schweitzer saw the photo in her newsfeed because she is a friend of Randi and Mark's sister Arielle- who was tagged in the picture- and decided to share the personal moment with her own 39,642 followers.

'Not sure where you got this photo. I posted it to friends only on FB. You reposting it to Twitter is way uncool,' Randi told Schweitzer in a public exchange on the microblogging site.

She quickly deleted original tweet with the photo but other sites like Buzzfeed quickly got a screengrab, and the Twitter account for hacker group Anonymous sent out that link.

Schweitzer responded back to Zuckerberg saying that her reaction was 'totally fair. I would hate for a private photo of mine to be public and would never want to do the same for others.'

'(For what it's worth), I thought the photo was incredibly endearing which is why I liked it. We never see humans on the internet!

'I'm completely sensitive to privacy. i loved the photo bc it seemed so fun and normal. You should make it public! ;)'

In spite of Schweitzer's grovelling, Randi Zuckerberg, who is now promoting a new show on Bravo about the allegedly glamorous world of tech start-ups in Silicon Valley, used the opportunity to make it a teaching moment.

'Digital etiquette: always ask permission before posting a friend's photo publicly. It's not about privacy settings, it's about human decency,' she wrote via Twitter.

Facebook first coined 'poking' as a way to get your friend's attention on their site, similar in style to 'liking' their updated status or a new picture.

Now it is an entirely different beast.

'With the Poke app, you can poke or send a message, photo, or video to Facebook friends to share what you're up to in a lightweight way,' said the site in a blog post announcing the new app.

The new version of pokes are similar to Snapchat, an app which is popular with younger age users, and which has gained a reputation as a tool for sending risque images.

Photo was a joke about the negative reaction to Facebook's new 'poke' app

Thought it would not get published because she allowed only her friends to see the picture on her Facebook profile
