A desperate search is underway for a family of four after a mother, her partner and the woman's two young daughters vanished last month.

The search for Brandon Jividen, 37, Rebecca Adams, 22, and Miss Adams’ children, Michelle Hundley, five, and three-year-old Jaracca Hundley has focused on woodland near the family's home in Kenai, Alaska.

Miss Adams' strange behavior in the days before she disappeared has left her family deeply worried. Her sister, Lanell Adams, said that young mother had been 'very distressed' during a phone call in the week before she went missing.

Local police received a call from a neighbor on May 31 who reported that a backyard shed door was lying open at the family's home.

Five days later on June 5, the same neighbor contacted the police to report that the family home appeared to have been lying empty for days.

Lanell Adams, who flew to Alaska from Washington state to look for her sister, said: 'I've called dozens of times. I'm scared more than anything.'

Adams said the last contact she had with her sister was distressing. The two women talked on the phone on Memorial Day weekend.

'She sounded very distressed,' Lanell Adams said. 'She just told me: ''Know that I love you,'' and she had to get off the phone very quickly.'

Lanell Adams said Rebecca Adams would not tell her what was wrong.

'Growing up we always had this thing, we say ''Thou shall not lie'' and you always have to tell the truth,' Lanell Adams said. 'I asked her, ''Thou shall not lie, Becca, are you ok?'' She said, ''Don't ask me that right now. Just know that I love you.'"

The FBI are looking for the two sisters who went missing with their mother and her partner in rural Alaska

The FBI and other state agencies are now involved in the hunt for the missing family. Dog teams and helicopters have been drafted in to search the area surrounding Kenai.

Lt. David Cook told ABC: 'At this point it’s not apparent where 
they have gone or where they might be.

'The investigation 
does not show that is foul play at this point, but we are very deep into
 the investigation of the missing persons.'

'The family has expressed some concern 
with the behavior of their sister Rebecca and have some concerns within 
her relationship [to Brandon].'

He refused to revealed specific details of the investigation but said that the main search area was woodland close to the family home on California Street, Kenai.

Relatives of Adams said the family left behind both of their cars, all of their camping and outdoor gear and the car seats for Adams' daughters.

The family's dog is also missing. They add that the cell phones of Jividen and Adams are turned off.

Lt. Cook added: 'The family has expressed some concern 
with the behavior of their sister Rebecca and have some concerns within 
her relationship [to Brandon].'

A Facebook group called Seeking Alaska's Missing  shared a picture of the missing family and urged anyone with information to contact the Kenai Police Department. The poster claimed that the family went missing on May 27.

Kenai, a rural fishing port in the Gulf of Alaska, has a population of around 7,000 people and is 160 miles from Anchorage.

The family disappeared from their home in Kenai, Alaska last month after relatives said that the mother, Rebecca Adams was showing signs of distress
