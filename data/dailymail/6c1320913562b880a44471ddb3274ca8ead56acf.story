Furious: Gordon Ramsay said he was 'astounded' to find prisoners enjoyed perks such as a gym, TV, DVDs and games consoles

Fiery television chef Gordon Ramsay has launched a scathing attack on Britain's jails, claiming criminals have it easy behind bars.

The outspoken Scot said he was 'astounded' to find prisoners enjoyed perks such as a gym, DVDs, games consoles and access to TV around the clock.

He was speaking after trying to teach inmates at London's Brixton prison to cook in a new TV show, due to be screened later this month.

Ramsay said he was disappointed by the prisoners' lack of enthusiasm and reluctance to work hard.

'What I wasn't prepared for was how easy it was for them in there,' he told Guardian Weekend. 'I was astounded at the comfort zone they carve out for themselves.

'Five meal choices a night - that was the one I really struggled with. I just thought it was a bit of a joke, to be honest.

'Coupled with 24-hour television, Xbox, DVDs, gym. We can't watch television until four o'clock in the morning. I'd like to have a gym seven days a week, by the way.'

The chef added: 'I thought we were a nation of grafters...Why would they want to come and bust their a**e for 10 hours a day when it was easy for them to do nothing?'

In the series, Gordon Ramsay Behind Bars, the chef sets up a kitchen - Bad Boys' Bakery - and trains inmates to cook and sell produce to businesses on the outside.

He said he was surprised by the high standard of the facilities, pointing out that professional chefs rarely walked into a kitchen so good.

But he felt angry and embarrassed about the prisoners' attitude, and he revealed how he became frustrated with the prison system.

'Everything was going against me,' he said. 'The system was completely screwed.'

Ramsay's comments come less than a week after it was revealed that a feud with his father-in-law had cost him at least £6million.

The celebrity chef was plunged into a legal battle after he accused Chris Hutcheson – who was also his business partner - of hacking into private emails and plundering £1.4million from his restaurant empire.

Hutcheson, whose daughter Tana is married to Ramsay, denied the claims and sued the chef for unfair dismissal and unpaid wages.

The row was resolved only when the Michelin-starred chef paid a reported £2 million to buy his business partner out of the 30 per cent share he owned of Gordon Ramsay Holdings in February.

A spokesman for Justice Secretary Ken Clarke said: 'We are building more working prisons in order to get more prisoners into constructive work and training, instead of enforced idleness in their cells, watching TV or playing computer games.

'A prisoner who works during his or her sentence will be paying back to society for the harm they have caused and be much less likely to return to crime on release. It's common sense.'

Gordon Ramsay Behind Bars is to be screened on Channel 4 from June 26.
