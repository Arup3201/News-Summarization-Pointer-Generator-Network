She's walked the runway for Marc Jacobs, showcased her curves for Agent Provocateur and is part of the new Primrose Hill set, so it comes as little surprise that Daisy Lowe has been snapped up to front a cool new beauty campaign.

The young model has been unveiled as the face of Rodial's makeup range - the UK's first specific sculpting and contouring collection - and proves her worth in the campaign shots.

The 25-year-old was chosen by the brand thanks to her 'modern, cool and quintessentially British edge.' 

So how does she feel about her new coup and what are the secrets behind her flawless look? FEMAIL caught up with the young star to discover her style and beauty secrets.

New face: Daisy Lowe has been unveiled as the new face of Rodial's debut makeup range, which is dedicated to contouring and sculpting 

'I am so excited about my new campaign,' she told us. 'I have always been a huge fan of Rodial and I was lucky enough to be honoured with their Woman of the Year award earlier this year, which was a total shock and really surreal. 

'I was flattered to be asked to get on board and I love the range so it was the perfect match.' 

The new makeup, which lands in Harvey Nichols on November 7,  is a capsule range of pieces designed to sculpt and define the face for a natural, flawless and radiant look.

'It's a fail safe range,' says Daisy. 'You just have to learn where to place the contouring. My top tip is: suck in your cheeks and make a fish face, which casts a natural shadow on your face. 

'Then apply the bronzer over that shadow and then pop the highlighter above that.'

After years on the modelling circuit, Daisy says the top tip she's picked up is using concealer around her nose to even the skin tone. 'Oh, and make your forehead and chin a lighter shade than the rest of your face for a more defined look,' she said. 

The model - who is the daughter of Pearl Lowe and Gavin Rossdale - cites Katharine Hepburn and Brigitte Bardot as her 'non fictional' style icons and Scarlett O'Hara from Gone With The Wind as her fictional one. 

'Scarlett is amazing, the absolute dream. Her face of just ridiculous,' she said. 

Daisy, who describes her personal style as 'Parisian chic with a naughty London twist, says she loves toughening up a grown up dress with grungy Dr. Martens to 'stay true to her Camden roots.'

Inspired by the 30s and 70s, she loves creations by Christopher Kane, Erdem and Saint Laurent and says online shopping at Topshop and Reformation is 'lethal'.

No wonder Daisy has such good style - she has best pal and fashion's darling Alexa Chung to share style secrets with.

Whilst Alexa, who is known for her famous feline flick and recently unveiled her own eye makeup range, has never given Daisy any beauty tips, the model says her friend is 'amazing' at doing makeup.

Daisy may have just been named as the new face of Rodial, but she's also been very busy with other projects. 

Recently, the in-demand brunette was unveiled as the new face of US clothing brand American Eagle Outfitters.

And, as well as her modelling duties, earlier this year the baking enthusiast released a recipe book entitled Sweetness and Light, a collection of recipes for 60 healthy sweet treats.

By making simple changes to ingredients, such as using maple syrup rather than refined sugar, or discovering new ingredients like raw chocolate, Daisy promises that her recipes are transformed into something 'devilishly delicious' but 'angelically healthy'.

'I just love cooking,' she told us. 'In the future I want to do more cooking, shooting campaigns and see the world.

'In five years time I want to continue doing loads of fashion stuff and be happy with a big smile on my face.'

With such a positive attitude to life, it's no wonder founder of Rodial, Maria Hatzistefanis, snapped her up.

She said: ‘I first met Daisy when she attended our Rodial awards where she won Woman of the Year. I was impressed by her effortless natural beauty, style and radiance. 

'What Daisy can bring to the Rodial brand is a modern, cool and quintessentially British edge.’

From the £52 illuminating powder to the £34 eye sculpt, each of the new products have been designed to contour and sculpt your face.

The powders are opalescent, which is designed to highlight facial features with an illuminating gleam and the universal champagne tone aims to add a candle-lit glow to the skin. 

The powders have micronization technology and fine pearls in the formula, which apparently gives the skin a silky texture and ensures even application.

The eye products have been made with a mousse-like texture, which, say the makers, can be built from a natural enhancement to a deeper sculpted frame, creating looks from day to night.

There's also a £24 tinted cream that adds a flush of colour to the cheeks to give a long-wearing healthy glow and is filled with hyaluronic acid, which promises to plump skin whilst the coral shade adds a subtle rosy colour to the apple of the cheeks.

If you want to try before you buy, Harvey Nichols will be opening a sculpting bar, where beauty fans can test out the products.
