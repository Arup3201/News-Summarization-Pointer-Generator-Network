With his immortal words ‘I told you I was ill’ carved onto his tombstone, Spike Milligan undoubtedly got the very last laugh.

But now one Briton has decided to go one step further and had the time of his life by holding a wake in advance of his own death.

Rex Curtis, 69, from Cornwall, invited 300 friends and family to a huge party - but he is not even terminally ill - he just didn’t want to miss it.

Speech: Rex said a few words - but was heckled and told to be quiet because he was 'dead'

Happy crowd: Unusually for a wake, the 300 or so friends had a great time at the event to celebrate Rex's ongoing life

Mr Curtis, who says he has 'one foot 
in the grave' because he has diabetes and had a heart bypass, tried to 
give a thank you speech but was told to shut up because he was 'dead'.

The party featured a musical 
performance, a comedian and a song by Rex’s wife Marilyn and he put all 
these efforts to a good cause - raising £1,500 for the Children’s 
Hospice South West.

Alive and kicking: Rex Curtis held his own wake, before his death, so he wouldn't miss the fun

Rex is also making a DVD of the event which will be sold to make more cash for charity.

Mr
Curtis, who ran a plant hire business before retiring said: 'I’ve had 
one foot in the grave for years really, so I didn’t want to wait until 
I’m gone to have the party.

'It was a beautiful do. People kept telling me it was crazy but it turned out brilliantly and raised lots of money for children.

'At one stage I was organising a more traditional post-funeral wake with the help of my cousin.

'But one night I woke up and thought "what good is there in having a good do if I won’t be there to enjoy it?'

'It felt like I wasn’t there, it was weird at times.

'When I said something to someone my cousin told me to shut up because I was dead.

Rex already has plans for his death.

'I have arranged for my ashes to be spread with a tractor and a spreader already,' he said.

'When my day comes I want people to enjoy themselves and be happy, I have had a good life.'

Rex
said he had organised his real wake and told people it was 'buy one, 
get one free, because they won’t have to pay for my real one'.

Invite: 300 people came to the event - and were asked not to bring flowers by wag Rex

His wife Marilyn, 59, said she was 'a bit taken aback' when Rex first revealed his wake plans.

She said: 'I thought it was a bit strange at first but then I said, why not.

'I encouraged him with the title ‘Alive and Kicking’ and the day went perfectly.

'This isn’t strange to Rex, he is very popular around here.'

Sing song: Guests were treated to music and entertainment, raising a big lump of cash for charity in the process
