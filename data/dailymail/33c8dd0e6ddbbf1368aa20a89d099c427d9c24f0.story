Pope Francis has once again broken with papal protocol by inviting an old friend for a spin on his famous 'Popemobile' during his weekly audience in St Peter's Square.

The Reverend Fabian Baez, a parish priest
 in Francis' hometown of Buenos Aires, didn't have a VIP ticket granting
 him a seat close to the altar or a spot where the pope would chat with 
well-wishers.

But as soon as Francis saw Baez in the crowd of several thousand people as the priest called out 'Santo Padre', the pope signaled for Vatican gendarmes to help Baez jump the barricade.

Holy hitchhiker: Pope Francis invited his old friend Reverend Fabien Baez (pictured behind Francis) for a ride in his famous white car during his weekly audience in St Peter's Square

Hugging him warmly, Francis then invited Baez to hop aboard his panoramic car.

Sat
 alongside the papal assistant, the priest, from Our Lady of the Pillar 
church, accompanied the pope through the square as the head of the 
Catholic church waved to well-wishers and kissed babies.

Baez
 said he was shocked by Francis' invitation, telling reporters 
afterward: 'I said to myself "What am I doing here? Mamma mia!"

'The pope laughed and said "Come, sit down, sit down!" And he continued to greet the people and kiss babies. I was very moved'

Baez
 said the two had known each other since the 1990s; the former Jorge 
Mario Bergoglio was archbishop of the Argentine capital before being 
named pope.

Friendly: When Francis saw Baez in the crowd he signaled for Vatican gendarmes to help Baez jump the barricade and hugging him, invited him aboard

The priest later summed up the day on his Twitter account, writing: 'Iâ€™m going to change my biography. "The poor priest who got on the popemobile today with #PopeFrancis"'

Francis was in particularly good 
spirits at Wednesday's audience, entertained by a circus troupe and 
greeted by Italy's Sampdoria football team, who presented the soccer-mad
 pope with yet another shirt.

Francis has added a bit of spontaneity to the Vatican's staid ways.

He
 lives in the Vatican hotel rather than the Apostolic Palace and 
eschewed the armored Popemobile for a simple Fiat during his trip to 
Brazil.

When he has left the Vatican, he has done so with a minimal security detail and no fancy motorcade.

All smiles:Sat alongside the papal assistant, the priest, from Our Lady of the Pillar church, accompanied the pope through the square as he waved to well-wishers

Surprise: Baez said he was shocked by Francis' invitation, telling reporters afterward: 'I said to myself "What am I doing here? Mamma mia!"'

History: Baez said the two had known each other since the 1990s; the former Jorge Mario Bergoglio was archbishop of the Argentine capital before being named pope
