Investigators are trying to determine if Aaron Hernandez has accused the former NFL star of threatening to kill a prison guard.

During an interrogation with an unidentified former inmate who served time in the Bristol County Jail with Hernandez, he was asked if he overheard Hernandez threaten to kill the guard and his family once he gets out of jail.

Hernandez is currently being held in the Massachusetts jail until his murder trial as he was charged with the June 2013 murder of his acquaintance Odin Lloyd.

Life behind bars: Investigators are looking into claims that Aaron Hernandez may have threatened to kill a guard because the man figured out how the former NFL star (seen at an August hearing) had tried to scam his way to more food

TMZ reports that the ex-inmate was asked if the alleged reason why Hernandez threatened the guard was because the unidentified guard apparently figured out how the athlete was trying to score more food from his cell.

The former Patriots tight end is reportedly concerned that he is losing too much weight and is trying to get extra meals by eating half of the allotted plate and then putting a bug or unsanitary scraps in the dish in the hopes of getting a second serving.

According to the ex-inmate, one prison guard figured out the plot and alerted his superiors to make sure that Hernandez didn't pull the stunt again.

TMZ reports that the inmate is now being questioned by investigators, who are looking to see if Hernandez said something 'to the effect of... when he gets out of jail, he's going to "kill the guard and shoot his family."'

They also asked if the 24-year-old imitated the noise of a 'machine gun round'.

So far, the former inmate said that Hernandez definitely called the guard 'a b****' but he did not say that Hernandez ever said an explicit threat to the man or his family.

This new inquiry comes just days after Hernandez's acquaintances were formally charged with murder in the death of Lloyd.

Lloyd was a semi-professional football player that Hernandez knew because Hernandez's fianc√©e was Lloyd's sister.

Lloyd was shot at point blank range and found miles from Hernandez's home in North Attleboro, Massachusetts, and investigators have been building a case around the claims that Lloyd knew about a 2012 double homicide that Hernandez and his friends were reportedly connected to.

On Friday, a Bristol County grand jury indicted Carols Ortiz and Ernest Wallace in Lloyd's murder.
