Axed former Hibs skipper James McPake insists Terry Butcher should not escape the blame for the club’s humiliating relegation.

Butcher is under intense pressure after Sunday’s defeat to Hamilton but kick-started a major cull of his playing squad with 14 players shipped out of Easter Road just 24 hours later.

The former England captain spent the day encamped at the club’s Tranent training base as he broke the news to players in a series of face-to-face meetings.

Speaking out: Axed Hibs skipper James McPake says Terry Butcher must accept some blame

McPake and fellow former skipper Kevin Thomson were among 10 players not offered new contracts, alongside Ben Williams, Alan Maybury, Paul Cairney and Tom Taiwo.

Sean Murdoch, Paul Grant, Bradley Donaldson, David Gold and Dean Horribine were also jettisoned, while loan players Daniel Boateng, Danny Haynes and Duncan Whatmore were told to return to their parent clubs.

Sportsmail understands current captain Liam Craig has been told Hibs won’t stand in his way if he can find a new club and it’s believed several other under-contract players have been told to take ‘substantial’ wage cuts or find another club.

As he made his way to the exit on Monday, a clearly devastated McPake insisted it would be wrong to conclude that Hibs’ first relegation since 1998 was solely down to the players.

Clearing the decks: Terry Butcher showed the door to 14 players following relegation

‘It’s probably going to be coming out that it’s all the players’ fault – but you can’t blame it all on the players,’ said the 29-year-old.

‘There’s no way it’s entirely the players’ fault; the players had got the club to two Scottish Cup Finals. Admittedly, we got beat in the two cup finals but we got them there and we finished quite comfortably in the league last season.

‘So, yes, blame lies with the players. We got the club relegated – but you can’ t entirely just look at the players.

‘The manager said he is looking for radical change but I don’t know what he means by that. If he means the players I’m not too sure the squad’s as bad as him saying that but that’s his opinion and that’s why he’s the manager and I’m not.

‘The players backed the manager and wanted to win every game. Before you back a manager you’re going out for personal pride and your family, you’re doing it for them before the manager.

‘There’s no way anybody in that squad wanted that club to be relegated. I saw 20 grown men in tears. There’s a lot of Hibernian fans in that dressing room as well.’

McPake was also critical of Butcher’s decision to throw kids like Alex Harris, Jason Cummings and Sam Stanton into the pressurised play-offs.

Cummings missed the vital penalty to send Hibs down while Harris was humiliatingly replaced after coming on as a substitute.

‘I feel sorry for Cummings, Harris and Sam Stanton. There was enough experience in the dressing room. That did not have to happen,’ he said.

McPake, who last played in October and missed a large chunk of the season with a back injury, insists he was fully fit for the last ten weeks of the season but was ignored by Butcher.

And he said: ‘I’m gutted that I’ve not been on the pitch to help. I’ve been training and been fully available for the past 10 weeks. I do believe I could have helped the team out. I’ve been desperate to help them out.

‘The manager just said he believed I wasn’t fit enough. That’s his opinion, but it’s not an opinion I agree with.

Thrown in at the deep end: Jason Cummings' penalty miss proved costly

'I believe I was more than capable of playing and I’ll stand by that. I had the operation in December. There were no complications with my rehab and I’ve felt as good as I have in the past two years.

‘100 per cent I could have contributed. I’m not saying I would definitely have made a difference – but I was fit enough.

‘I’m gutted to be leaving Hibs. I loved playing for this football club. I had some good times and I had some very bad times too. But I’m most disappointed that I didn’t get the chance to help this club stay in the Premiership.

‘Sunday was a devastating day for everyone but we had enough chances to save ourselves.’
