House Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday that he will file a lawsuit against President Obama for what he claimed is a series of abuses of power in the executive branch of the federal government.

'This is not about impeachment,' the Ohio legislator insisted. 'It's about him faithfully executing the laws of this country.'

Obama has touted his 'pen and phone' approach to implementing his domestic agenda by going around Congress, casting 2014 during his most recent State of the Union address as a 'year of action.'

'What we've seen, clearly over the last five years, is an effort to erode the power of the legislative branch,' Boehner said. 'I believe the president is not faithfully executing the laws of our country.'

House Speaker John Boehner said on Wednesday that he plans to sue President Barack Obama over his series of executive actions that have sidestepped Congress

Golfer-in-chief: Barack Obama has spent as much time bypassing Congress as he has on the links, say Republicans

White House press secretary Josh Earnest accused congressional Republicans of obstruction and said they had left Obama with little option but to make greater use of his executive authority  

The White House says he has undertaken at least 20 'executive actions' this year, mostly on agenda items where legislation has been bogged down in the Republican-dominated House of Representatives.

His more controversial actions have included raising the minimum wage for companies undertaking new federal government contracts, ordering a long series of changes to the implementation schedule of his Obamacare law, decreeing new fuel-economy standards for trucks, and – most recently – declaring that the EPA will enforce a wide-ranging set of rules governing carbon emissions.

Obama's Climate Action Plan, formalized this week, is being called a 'coal-killer' because it will dramatically increase costs associated with building and running coal-fired electric power plants.

But most objectionable to conservatives in Boehner's caucus, according to multiple Capitol Hill sources, is the president's 2012 action that deferred deportation for hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children.

That move, Republicans say, led directly to the current border crisis that has seen tens of thousands of unaccompanied children – including many toddlers and infants – being brought across the U.S.-Mexico border in the hope of an amnesty.

'The fact that they are considering a taxpayer-funded lawsuit against the President of the United States for doing his job, I think, is the kind of step that most Americans wouldn't support,' Earnest said.

'This lawsuit is not going to consume the attention of the White House.' 

Fox News host Neil Cavuto, an unlikely ally of the Obama administration, bemoaned the GOP's latest move as partisan politics on his show Wednesday afternoon.

'Where was your rage when Democrats were going after President Bush on the same use of executive orders?' Cavuto asked Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann.

'I think you know in your heart of hearts this is a waste of time now. There are far more important things you guys have to be addressing.'

Bachmann apparently didn't get her caucus leader's memo that the purpose of the lawsuit was not to impeach the president.

'What we should do right now is defund the executive branch while we have the option,' Bachmann said. 'What we can do further is impeach the elected official.'

'Think about what you are saying,' Cavuto told her during the shouting match. 'The Democrats would be in their right mind to laugh you out.'

Executive action: The GOP says Obama's 2012 unilateral policy change on immigration enticed tens of thousands of unaccompanied children to cross the U.S. border, putting a strain on government resources and creating a humanitarian emergency

Boehner said he hasn't yet decided exactly which of Obama's executive actions he will challenge in court

Boehner 
told reporters on Wednesday that he hasn't yet decided which of Obama's 
executive actions he will challenge in federal court.

'When I make that decision, I'll let you know,' he said.

He told a closed-door House Republican Conference meeting on Tuesday – and followed up with a detailed memo
 – that he plans to move ahead with the lawsuit in the coming weeks. The
 whole House of Representatives would be the plaintiff, meaning he will 
need the approval of House leaders.

With the GOP in the majority, that isn't expected to be a problem.

The Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group, an informal House leadership panel, will likely make the call. It includes Boehner, newly minted Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Majority Whip Steve Scalise, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer. A simple majority vote, likely 3-2, will determine if Boehner can proceed.

Asked in his weekly press briefing on Wednesday if he's committed to moving forward, he replied, 'I am.'

The House has passed legislation that would curb the president's power to take executive actions that Republicans say fall outside his constitutional authority, but Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has declared them dead on arrival.

Boehner spokesman Michael Steele told Roll Call on Tuesday that Obama 'has a clear record of ignoring the American people’s elected representatives and exceeding his constitutional authority, which has dangerous implications for both our system of government and our economy.'

'The House has passed legislation to address this,' said Steele, 'but it has gone nowhere in the Democratic-controlled Senate, so we are examining other options.'
