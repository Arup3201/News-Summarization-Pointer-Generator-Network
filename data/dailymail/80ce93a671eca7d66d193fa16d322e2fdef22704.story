Only girls are allowed at a new workout class that promises fat-burning results in just half an hour.

It's called Hiitgirl and is based on the principles of high intensity interval training. Women join exercise classes dependent on their fitness and follow a trainer telling them when to work hard and when to take short rests.

The classes are all carried out barefoot and there's a giant timer on the wall to help people keep up with when to work intensely and when to relax.

To keep things fun and interesting, the exercises in the class vary week to week but are all designed to raise the heart rate and tone the body. Sometimes body weight is used for resistance and on other occasions fitness 'toys' such as medicine balls, sandbags, skipping ropes and trampettes are used.

Exercises such as burpees, press ups and sits ups are carried out as well as core stability moves like the plank.

Each class lasts half an hour but because it involves high intensity exercise, participants boost their metabolism so they keep on burning fat for hours afterwards.

While the exercises themselves may not be anything new, Hiitgirl believe their female-only format and variety of different moves in each 30 minute session make them different.

The classes were developed by fitness experts Susan and Stuart Dyson who wanted to find a way to help busy women fit exercise into their lives. They also wanted to attract those who are intimidated by the macho vibe at some mixed gyms and wanted to work out in a more female-friendly space.

Susan said: 'Hiitgirl started with a simple question, "how can busy women spend as little time as possible working out and still get amazing results?"

'After speaking with lots of women it became clear that they simply didn't have the time or interest for endless cardio and expensive personal training. The majority wanted short and effective female-friendly workouts with inspiring trainers.'

Writer and actress Arabella Weir admits she is a Hiitgirl convert since she first tried the class last month and has been going to three classes a week. 

No need for trainers: All the classes are carried out barefoot

She told MailOnline: 'I have been a member at a gym before and tried all sorts of different workouts but I needed something that was time efficient and easy to fit into my routine.

'Hiitgirl is all beautifully contained - it allows me to pop in and out in half an hour and I know I'm getting an intensive workout. It doesn't feel like a gym or a fitness studio, it's a lovely environment.

'I don't feel the sort of dread that I did with other 
workouts. Knowing that you have to endure a long session with heavy 
weights or a long run is often off-putting but with this, you know that 
you only have to get through half an hour and that you'll likely be 
doing something different to last time. It is exactly what I and many other women need - we're done and dusted in 30 minutes.'

Arabella said it's one of the toughest workouts she has ever done but she's already noticing the results.

She said: 'I noticed changes in my body shape after just a few weeks. My stomach is flatter and my clothes are looser. People are telling me that I'm looking slimmer in my jeans which - let's be honest - is what we all want to hear.

'I'm definitely fitter. The exercise that has always crippled me is press ups and now I can do them. The plank was the other exercise I could never master but again, I can manage the full 30 seconds.'

The 55-year-old doesn't weigh herself so she doesn't know how many pounds she has shifted thanks to the workout. She said she prefers to focus on getting fitter and toning up than obsessing over the scales.

She explained: 'Any woman past the age of 19 has to think of things in terms of fitness and shape, not weight. I don't weigh myself so I couldn't say if I've lost any weight but it's not about that. I know my shape is changing and I'm getting fitter.'  

Hiitgirl classes are held at three locations in Harrogate and at selected Sweaty Betty stores around the country. For those in London, they opened the first Hiitgirl Studio in Crouch End last month.

Women are taking inspiration from super-fit Olympians such as Jessica Ennis and are hitting the gym in pursuit of washboard abs, a new survey has revealed.

Men, meanwhile, are looking towards the rugby fraternity and want powerful pecs similar to those displayed by Channing Tatum in 2012 film Mad Mike.

But while stomachs and chests get plenty of attention, the backside, or glutes, is neglected with just three per cent of men and two per cent of women saying they do exercises designed to target them.

Now a spokesman for Simply Gym, has warned that neglecting the buttocks could lead to a less than shapely physique.

He said: 'The glutes often get ignored during workouts. If lunges, hip extensions and squats don’t appeal to you, classes such as Legs, Bums and Tums are a great way to target problem areas.

'Some women don’t like the idea of training with weights because they’re worried it will give them bulging muscles, but resistance training is not only great for toning up but will also boost your fat burning efforts,' he added.
