A comedian has come under fire after claiming that David Cameron’s health reforms mean the PM ‘wants kids to die’.

Rufus Hound, who presents a show on BBC Radio 4, is standing in the European Parliament elections on a platform of ‘opposing NHS privatisation’.

Last night there were calls for him to be dropped by the Corporation after he referred to Mr Cameron and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt in a blog entitled ‘David and Jeremy want your kids to die (unless you’re rich)’.

Rufus Hound claimed on his blog that David Cameron 'wants your kid to die' but The Prime Minister's son Ivan died at the age of six in 2009

The
 Prime Minister’s son Ivan died aged six in 2009 after suffering from  
cerebral palsy and a rare form of epilepsy – and Mr Cameron has 
regularly spoken of his gratitude to NHS staff for his son’s care.

Yesterday
 Tory MP Rob Wilson described the comments as ‘disgusting and crass’. 
‘There is a space for honest and passionate disagreement in a democracy,
 but calling those who happen to disagree with you child murderers is 
nothing more than a lazy and nasty slur,’ he added. 

The
 comic, 34, made the comments in a blog after he launched his surprise 
candidacy for the National Health Action Party on The Jonathan Ross Show
 on ITV on Saturday night.

Since
 April 1, major reforms have put health budgets back in the hands of 
groups of GPs, while ministers have demanded £20billion of savings to 
cope with an ageing population and the cost of drugs and treatments. But
 Mr Hound has accused the Conservatives of wanting to privatise the 
service and sell it off to party donors.

His
 expletive-laden blog post said: ‘The millionaires that currently run 
things have decided that you (assuming you’re not a member of the 
Bullingdon Club, or a trustafarian) can go f*** yourself.

‘This
 place is for them, not you. Why should you get free healthcare? Why 
can’t they take that big pot of money ear-marked for medicine and just 
start sharing it out amongst themselves?’

He
 accused ‘big, rich, private healthcare companies’ that have donated 
millions to the Conservative Party of ‘calling in the debt’. ‘Jeremy 
Hunt is killing the NHS so that his owners can bleed you dry,’ he added.
 Mr Hound, who is standing as an MEP candidate for London, said the NHS 
is one of the ‘single greatest achievements of any civilisation’.

Despite
 criticism on Twitter yesterday, he refused to apologise. Former MP Dr 
Richard Taylor, who founded the NHA two years ago, told LBC Radio that 
he would discuss the comedian’s ‘fairly extreme’ choice of words.

He
 added: ‘I don’t think anybody can really agree that they [Cameron and 
Hunt] want people to die, but by their actions they are risking that and
 I think that’s what Rufus means and I would agree with him there is a 
risk.’

The BBC said Mr Hound, who presents the Radio Four show My Teenage Diary, is not an employee but a freelancer.

Personal views on his own blog were not the BBC’s responsibility, said a spokesman.
