The people of Newtown have voted unanimously to raze Sandy Hook Elementary School to prevent further traumatising the remaining students.

Gunman Adam Lanza killed 26 people, including 20 young children, there in December.

The design will be funded with a $750,000 grant from the state of Connecticut, confirmed First Selectman Patricia Llorda.

it into an exact replica

Ms Llorda said: ‘This was the first of two crucial steps in getting a new school built and it was a tremendous show of support by the community,’ reported the New York Daily News.

A crowd of 150 people squeezed into the municipal chambers to unanimously approve the plan.

Currently students and staff at the 
school are at Chalk Hill School in neighbouring town, Monroe. They will 
remain there until June 2016.

There
will be a referendum on October 5 to allow the people of Newtown to 
approve plans to spend the remaining $50million from the state grant.

The school will not be demolished until this final vote.

They hope that a new school will be open by September 2016.

School Board member John Vouros said: ‘Having taught here for 35 years, this was very important to me personally and to the entire school community and town. ‘This shows the town is moving forward ... and this is a giant step.’

Adam Lanza fired on children in the school in December of last year.

In April it emerged that Lanza had 
been beaten and taunted by his fellow classmates while he was a student 
at Sandy Hook Elementary, and his mother had considered filing a lawsuit
against the school.

Speaking exclusively with the New York Daily News, the relative said
that the man who would grow up to murder his mother, Nancy, was 
viciously bullied by his classmates and would come home from class with 
bruises over his body.

Nancy
Lanza was ‘irate’ in her belief that the educators at Sandy Hook 
weren’t doing all in their power to protect her son, they said.

Preliminary recommendations on $7.7 
million in donations collected after the Connecticut school shooting 
calls for giving $281,000 to each of the families of the 26 children and
school educators killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School last year.

The
families of 12 surviving children who witnessed the Dec. 14 shootings 
would each get $20,000; two teachers who were injured would get $150,000
between them.

A 
community foundation has been tasked with dividing up $11.4 million that
was raised with the help of the United Way. The foundation previously 
decided to divvy up $7.7 million to the families and survivors and to 
have committees decide on uses for the remainder of the donations, 
including whether to use some of it for future mental health care and 
other needs.
