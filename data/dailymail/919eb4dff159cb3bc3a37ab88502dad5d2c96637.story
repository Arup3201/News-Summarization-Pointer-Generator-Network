The reputation of China’s new £400million Shijiazhuang Railway Station has been washed away by multiple leaks during a rainstorm that turned the inside of the building into a giant waterfall.

Torrential rain hit Shijiazhuang city, Hebei province, on Thursday night, but its railway station, which is served by China’s high-speed trains, was not up to the job of sheltering passengers.

Water passed through the ceiling of the station, built in 2012, soaking passengers waiting inside.

The downpour led to the suspension of dozens of services.

Some passengers who uploaded pictures of the cascading water to the internet said the problem was exacerbated by the station’s design, which incorporates lots of windows in the roof. 

Many of these were open when the rain started, they claimed.

It comes after the roof of a Sydney Opera House replica building in China was  taken off due to severe leaks.

The knock-off building, in Liaoning province's Fuxin county near Inner Mongolia, came under the spotlight four years ago when the local government forked out 1.1 million yuan (£100,000 ) to construct it.

The building, which was used as a waterside restaurant, was one of China's many 'grand projects' to re-brand regional cities as cultural hubs to attract tourists and investment.

The roof structures were removed after a two-day-long process. One staff member told the Shanghaiist that the restaurant had been shut down last year as part of leader Xi Jinping's anti-extravagance campaign, and that local authorities had ordered the roof to be taken down.

A spokesman with the county's housing construction bureau said the structural leakage was the reason for the roof's removal.

'Maybe the style is not satisfying,' said another staff commenter.
