Young people who get drunk several times a week are at risk of suffering a mental illness, doctors have warned.

While it's no secret that binge drinking can cause major health problems,  too much alcohol can have a dangerous effect on mood disorders and slow brain development. 

Sydney experts found young people who already suffer mental health problems, can worsen their symptoms.

Too much alcohol can have a dangerous effect on mood disorders and slow brain development, doctors warn

Drinking alcohol on a weekly basis could affect the structural and neurochemical changes to the parts of the brain responsible for long-term memory and decision making, according to ABC.

Dr Daniel Hermens from the University of Sydney's Brain and Mind Research Institute (BMRI) told ABC that between the ages of 16 and 25 brains are undergoing a lot of change and alcohol can impair that growth.

'If you're a young person with depression, a history of depression, or even a family history of depression, then you may be at an even greater risk of brain changes, changes in your concentration and your memory if you misuse alcohol,' Dr Hermens said.

But good news is that the young brain is 'best equipped to recover', according to Dr Daniel Hermens

ABC reports the Brain and Mind Research Institute wants to develop a cognitive screening test for hospitals and GPs to detect the subtle neurological impacts of alcohol misuse in young people's brains.

'The really good news about all this though is that the young brain is best equipped to recover,' Dr Hermens said.

Psychiatrist Dr Elizabeth Scott from Headspace told ABC that without early intervention, young people are in danger of developing more persistent and chronic problems that have a major impact on their adult life.

'Young people with mental health problems are two to three times more likely to use drugs and alcohol compared to their peers of the same age in the general community,' she said.

'The mix of mental health problems and drugs and alcohol problems can lead to vicious cycles of illness and disability.'
