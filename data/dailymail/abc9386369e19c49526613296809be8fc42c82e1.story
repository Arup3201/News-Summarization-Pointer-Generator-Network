The family of the nurse who killed herself after being fooled by a prank call directed at the Duchess of Cambridge today described the 'unfillable void' she had left in their lives as she was remembered at Westminster Cathedral.

Jacintha Saldanha's husband read out a moving tribute to the woman he described as 'the light in my darkness', adding: 'I love you and miss you forever.'

The 46-year-old mother of two was found hanging in her nurses' quarters at King Edward VII's Hospital by a colleague last Friday, two days after transferring a phone call from two Australian radio DJs to a nurse on Kate's ward.

A mass was held at London's Roman Catholic cathedral on Saturday morning 'for the repose of the soul of Jacintha and her grieving family', according to a spokesman.

Following the service, Ms Saldanha's husband Benedict Barboza and her children Junal and Lisha paid an emotional tribute to a 'kind-hearted, generous and well-respected woman'.

Fighting back tears, Mr Barboza said: 'My wife, you were the light in my darkness, who always showed me the way forward.

'From the day we met, you always stood by me in times of hardship and happiness.

'Nineteen years of togetherness with a strong bond of affection and understanding will be cherished forever in my life.

'Your loss is a very painful one and nobody can take that place in my life ever again. I love you and miss you forever.'

Ms Saldanha's son 16-year-old Junal said: 'Our mother, kind-hearted, generous and a well respected woman in both of our lives. You were the core of the family who kept us together.

'In times of difficulty you showed us the way forward to happiness and success.

'Your priority for us was a good education and a bright future. You taught us right from wrong which we appreciate.

'You
worked tirelessly to give us everything that we have today. When we 
achieved good grades and merit, your pat on our backs encouraged us 
more.'

Daughter Lisha, 14, said: 'We will miss your laughter, the loving memories and the good times we had together. The house is an empty dwelling without your presence.

'We are shattered and there's an unfillable void in our lives.

'We love you mum, sleep in peace and watch over us until me meet again in heaven. We will always love you and keep you close to our heart.'

Standing outside the cathedral alongside their local MP Charlotte Leslie and MP Keith Vaz, who has been campaigning on behalf of the family, Mr Barboza said the family 'could not have foreseen the unprecedented tragedy that has unfolded in our lives'.

He added: 'The events of the last week have shattered our lives. We barely have the strength to withstand the grief and sorrow.'

He thanked the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prime Minister David Cameron for their condolences.

During the service, Father Alexander 
Master said: 'The mass is offered for the repose of the soul of Jacintha
Saldanha and also for the family, some of whom we welcome here today.

'We pray for them and, in particular, for her.'

Memorial
services have already been held at the hospital where Ms Saldanha 
worked and in Bristol where her husband and children live.

The nurse left three notes and also had marks on her wrist when her 
body was discovered, Westminster Coroner's Court heard on Thursday.

The
DJs behind the hoax call - Mel Greig and Michael Christian - have given
an emotional account of their reaction to Ms Saldanha's death.

Interviewed
on Australian TV networks, the presenters said their prank call to the 
hospital prompted 'a tragic turn of events no-one could have predicted 
or expected'.

Southern 
Cross Austereo (SCA), the parent company of 2Day FM, has ended the 
pair's Hot 30 show and suspended prank calls across the company.

Upsetting: The memorial is taking place inside St Teresa Church, Bristol. Family and friends of the 46-year-old nurse are in attendance

Remembering: Junal lights a candle for his mother during the service

Yesterday
it emerged that Ms Saldanha left a note criticising her treatment from 
the hospital in the aftermath of the prank call.

As
her family attended an emotional memorial service last night, they are 
said to be furious that Jacintha Saldanha was not given more support.

The letter, one of three notes, is said to be highly critical of King Edward VII Hospital.

In another, the mother of two detailed
her anguish and shame about being duped by two Australian DJs, 
pretending to be the Queen and Prince Charles, into passing on the call.
The third deals with her requests for her funeral, which will be held 
in her hometown of Shirva, south-west India.

A source close to the family said: 
'One of the letters, which is the longest, deals with the hospital and 
is critical in its tone. Needless to say her husband Ben wants a full 
inquiry into what happened, and he wants to make sure the truth comes 
out.

'Within the letter Jacintha calls into question some of the treatment she received at the hospital.'

In memory: This is the order of service from the memorial service at St Teresa's Church

King Edward VII Hospital responded by 
issuing a strongly-worded statement in which it said it had 'stood by 
her actions', 'considered her the victim of a cruel hoax' and made it 
clear there would have been 'noÂ  disciplinary action of any kind'.

At Mrs Saldanha's memorial service 
last night, candles were lit in her memory. Speaking to a packed St 
Teresa's Church in Bristol, Father Tom Finnegan praised her caring and 
nurturing devotion as a nurse. He said: 'Jacintha was a much loved wife,
mother and friend who is sorely missed.'

He read a tribute from daughter Lisha, who said: 'We miss you so much. Your priority for us was a good 
education and a bright future. You taught us right from wrong.

'The house is empty, a dwelling 
without presence. We are shattered and there is an incredible void in 
our life. We will always love you and keep you close in our heart.'

Father Finnegan also read a tribute 
from husband Ben Barboza, a 49-year-old NHS accountant, in which he said
he felt 'as if a part of me has been ripped off' and he missed his 
wife's 'sparkling personality'.

'Your loss is very painful and I will love you and miss you for ever.'

Saddened: Sydney-based 2DayFM radio presenters Michael Christian (left) and Mel Greig (right in left, and right) made a grovelling apology in two interviews aired on Australian TV yesterday (one seen right)

The hospital also held a memorial 
service yesterday morning for her 'deeply shocked' colleagues and 
friends to pay their respects.

It comes a week after Mrs Saldanha, 
46, was found dead in nurses' accommodation. Her body was released after
an inquest into her death was opened and adjourned yesterday, and it 
will be flown to India over the weekend.

Rhys Holleran, chief executive of 
Australian radio company Southern Cross Austereo, which owns 2DayFM, 
said yesterday that there would be a review of procedures. He appeared 
to clear the station of any wrong-doing by saying that 'an initial 
internal review of events leading up to the broadcast of the call showed
that set processes were followed'.

But he added that given the tragic 
circumstances, the company had decided upon 'a complete review of all of
our procedures and processes'.
