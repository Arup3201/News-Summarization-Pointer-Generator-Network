Bernie Ecclestone has suggested Formula One is poised for a dramatic change should a number of cash-strapped teams go to the wall over the winter.

The likes of Sauber, Marussia and Caterham are currently teetering on the brink of extinction as a result of rising, unchecked costs associated with running their teams.

To that extent, plans have been aired at recent meetings with regard to the prospect of eight, three-car teams being on the grid in 2015.

Speaking at a promotional event in Singapore ahead of this weekend's race around the Marina Bay Street Circuit, Ecclestone said: 'It has always been on the cards if we lose up to three teams the others will run three cars.

'I think we should do it anyway. I would rather see Ferrari with three cars, or any of the other top teams with three cars, than having teams that are struggling.'

Asked whether such a concept could happen next year, Ecclestone added: 'We'll know after the next two or three races, but it is being looked at.'

One suggestion is for the back-of-the-grid teams to be provided with financial assistance to overcome their current difficulties.

But as Ecclestone states, it has been the way of F1 over the years that teams have come and gone - many for financial reasons.

'I've been around - most people would say too long - but long enough to know there are always people at the back of the grid,' remarked the 83-year-old.

'The trouble with the teams - which is all normal - they think of themselves short term.

'You ask about next year, but they're worried about the next race, which is the problem.'

Another issue for Ecclestone to resolve is whether to continue with the controversial double-points system for the final race of a year.

The season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in November will serve as the acid test of whether the concept loathed by the majority of fans has worked.

Successful or not, though, it could be the system is axed regardless.

Ecclestone added: 'I wanted it (double points) to be for the last three races.

'Then people would believe it still possible somebody else could win, but everyone said I was mad, so we won't do it.

'As for keeping it for the last race, I don't know. Probably not. We can't yet see whether it has worked, it depends.

'It just seemed to me the right way to keep the championship open, otherwise for the last three or four races people are running in non-championship races.'

Ecclestone, meanwhile, has suggested more measures may be taken to make a driver's life more difficult over the course of a grand prix weekend.

Ecclestone's remarks follow a suggestion of his coming into force from this weekend's race - the banning of certain types of radio messages.

Asked whether he was in favour of the ban, Ecclestone smiled and then replied: 'As I was the one who started it off, yes.'

Suggested it was imperative drivers do more rather than continually relying on information from the pit wall, Ecclestone added: 'I think none of the drivers want it (radio). They are all happy it has gone.

'They drive the cars, they should know what is wrong or right. They don't need someone on the pit wall telling them what to do.

'We have a regulation in force drivers must drive the car unaided. They have been aided - and still are.

'Even if we get rid of this 'ship to shore' as I call it, there are still a lot of aids that they should not have.

'Driving is still not easy, but it was easier than it was.'

Asked whether more rule changes would come into effect, Ecclestone replied: 'I think we might...to make their life more difficult.
