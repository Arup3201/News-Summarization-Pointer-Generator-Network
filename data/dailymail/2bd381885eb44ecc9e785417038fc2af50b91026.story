Britain’s second biggest supermarket put up prices on more than 100 products before cutting them to 50p in a New Year price war.

Asda launched the promotion to grab customers from mainstream rivals and boasted its prices would be even cheaper than pound shops and Aldi.

However, independent research has discovered that the prices of many of these products went up sharply in the ten weeks before the promotion was launched.

The net effect of the yo-yo prices was to make savings look much bigger than they were.

Yo yo prices: Asda has been accused of putting up prices on more than 100 products before cutting them to 50p in a New Year price war

The same tactic has been deployed by other major supermarkets in the past as a marketing strategy designed to attract customers trapped in a cost of living squeeze.

The mainstream chains – Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons – are under huge pressure because thousands of shoppers are deserting to cheaper budget chains, such as Aldi and Lidl.

The revelations about the Asda price cuts will come as no surprise to families who have lost trust in supermarkets to deliver the price cuts they claim.

At the same time, official industry figures show that food prices continue to rise faster than rises in wages, which makes clear that any temporary reductions on some items are more than wiped out by increases on others.

The research was carried out by retail experts at BrandView.com and published in the industry magazine The Grocer.

The figures show that Asda reduced the price of 246 lines to 50p on January 1 on the back of a promised to ‘offer more value than ever’.

Claims: Researchers say Oreo biscuits went up in October from 50p to £1.08 before going back down to 50p in January

In fact the price of 120 of these products was raised in the previous 10 weeks. At the same time, the average price of 155 items that were directly comparable with others sold by Tesco and Sainsbury’s rose by an average of 46per cent – 63p to 92p – over the same period.

Denial: Asda said they would never deliberately mislead their customers but experts said today it was a common tactic

The investigation also found that 57 of the items that were reduced to 50p have now returned to their full price.

On October 30, the Batchelors Deli Box went up from 50p to £1.19, while Pot Noodle increased from 50p to £1. Both then were reduced to 50p on January 1.

Another big riser in October was Oreo vanilla biscuits, which climbed from 50p to £1.08 before going back down to 50p.

Bryan Roberts, insight director at retail analysts Kantar, suggested supermarkets who are not open and straightforward with customers risk losing out.

‘This type of strategy -- of raising prices to make a promotion look more lucrative -- is commonplace among all the supermarkets,’ he said.

‘But it is not necessarily the right thing to do and Asda is not being as transparent as it could with its shoppers.’

When Asda launched the price cut promotion in January, its  chief merchandising officer for food, Barry Williams, said: ‘With hundreds of products at 50p, we’ re even making the pound shop and Aldi look expensive.

‘It goes without saying that Christmas can be a struggle financially … and it’s more clear than ever that UK shoppers’ priorities are well and truly focused on price.

‘That’s why, this January, we are offering more value than ever before across our stores on the products that people actually week in, week out. With hundreds of products at 50p, we’re even making the poundshop and Aldi look expensive.’

Asda, which is owned by Walmart of the US, claims it is holding down prices by £50million in the first three months of 2014 as part of a bigger £200m reduction during the year.

The store denied trying to pull the wool over customers’ eyes.

A spokesman said: ‘We would never deliberately mislead our customers, all we aim to do is save them money every day.

‘At Asda, we take pricing incredibly seriously, so much so that last year we formed a Pricing Integrity group that monitors every aspect of our pricing. Last year we invested over £130million directly into lowering prices and holding down the cost of living for our customers.

‘We’re equally proud that we have already committed to directly investing over £50million into lowering the costs of our products across our stores this quarter and we’ve now got more 50p lines than any other supermarket.’

In November, the retailer announced that it will be investing £1 billion in lowering prices and £250 million in quality, style and design over the next five years.
