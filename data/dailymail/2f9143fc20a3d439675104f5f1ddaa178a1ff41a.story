She might be celebrating her 50th but it was business as usual for Sophie Wessex who spent the day visiting a charity project and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

Clearly enjoying her big day, a beaming Sophie made sure husband Prince Edward was ready for his close up as she demonstrated a new eye examination gadget, laughing as she held the screen centimetres from his face. 

Wielding the Portable Eye Examination Kit (PEEK), which lets smartphones take high resolution pictures of the eye, she gave onlookers a glimpse of Edward's magnified iris as he sat patiently, staring into the lens.

Looking perfectly put together, Sophie knelt and talked to children bearing balloons and waving flags 

But while she might have been working, the royal did at least get a cake which was presented to her by well-wishers during an engagement at St. Anselm's Church in Kennington. 

She blew out the candles before cutting slices for herself and a group of well-wishers.She and Edward then enjoyed a cup of tea in big white mugs - the Prince's bearing the logo, 'I'm with the mob'.

The Countess was at St. Anselm's Church on behalf of Tomorrow's People, a charity that aims to find alternative ways of getting underprivileged adults and young people into work.

Along with training programmes, the charity encourages people to start businesses of their own - some of which were selling their wares from stalls set up outside the church.

Indeed, Sophie's birthday cake, which boasted gold candles, pink flower decorations and the legend 'Happy Birthday HRH Sophie, was made by a baker whose career began on a Tomorrow's People programme.

The Countess's birthday posy also came from a beneficiary of the scheme, as did the coffee she and Prince Edward were offered as they arrived.

When it comes to royal style, no one can take the crown from our ultimate regal style icon, The Duchess of Cambridge, but The Countess of Wessex is definitely one to have on your regal radar!

The ever elegant Countess always looks chic and is a pro when it comes to occasion dressing. Working with a berry tone palette, Sophie donned a blush colored collarless coat worn over a pretty pink dress, accessorizing her look with a burgundy clutch bag and suede knee high boots.

The Countess’s boots are by L.K. Bennett, which is coincidentally also one of Kate’s favorite brands. A great investment piece, these boots will go with so many different outfits and can be worn time and time again.

Sophie, who was  presented with a framed map of London as she left, was on typically glamorous form for the event and cut an elegant figure in her cream cocoon coat. 

Beneath it she wore a delicate powder pink dress and completed the look with a burgundy snakeskin clutch and hair twisted up into an elegant knot.

A bigger birthday gift came later in the day, when the Countess was officially confirmed as vice-patron of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Trust. 

The Trust, a charitable foundation set up to mark the Queen's 60th anniversary on the throne, is headed by Her Majesty with Sophie now deputising for the monarch herself.

Royal watchers will see this as yet another sign of the Queen's affection for her youngest daughter-in-law, with whom she is thought to have a particularly close relationship.

Indeed, Sophie and her family spent more time at Christmas with the Queen and Prince Philip than any other, with the couple remaining at Sandringham after the rest of the family had left.

Although the Queen was not there today, the visit to the London Centre for Hygiene and Tropical Medicine was to find out more about a programme close to the Her Majesty's heart.

The Avoidable Blindness Programme is one of two overseen by the Diamond Jubilee Trust and is one that dovetails with Sophie's own interest in helping the disabled.

Reading by royal appointment! Camilla teams up with Chris Evans to launch writing challenge for children

The Duchess of Cornwall was joined by DJ Chris Evans at Clarence House this morning as they teamed up to launch a short story contest.

Camilla has long been a supporter of literary initiatives and will host the final of the 500 Words competition at St James's Palace in May.

Recently returned from a break at her Scottish home Birkhall, the Duchess has a busy week ahead but appeared to be on top form as she chatted to Evans.

The two will also appear at a 'story laboratory' to mark the launch of this year's contest - which aims to find promising young writers - at Weston Park Primary School, London, tomorrow.

Under-13s can take part by writing a work of fiction no longer than 500 words with entries through the Radio 2 website at bbc.co.uk/500words.

The judging panel includes Top Gear's Richard Hammond, plus writers Francesca Simon, Charlie Higson, Frank Cottrell Boyce and Children's Laureate Malorie Blackman.

Six winners will eventually be chosen, with their works read out on air by famous names - last year's included Benedict Cumberbatch and Hugh Bonneville.

'We couldn't believe our luck when HRH the Duchess of Cornwall invited us to hold our live on-air final in the stunning surroundings of St James's Palace,' said Evans afterwards.

'She's a supporter of the competition and cannot wait to meet and greet this year's 50 finalists on the day. Get writing and get in the mix, by Royal Appointment.'

Prize: Children who enter can win the top prize of having their stories read out by famous names on the radio
