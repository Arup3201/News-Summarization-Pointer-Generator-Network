The Christmas Day siege gunman  has been charged with attempted murder after a 12-hour siege on the Gold Coast.

The 36-year-old was charged with attempted murder, deprivation of liberty, assault occasioning bodily harm and unlawful possession of a weapon. 

He fired at least two gun shots in the past 24 hours, one while he was holed up inside a unit on White St, Southport.

Police have not yet identified the man but Inspector Bruce Kuhn said he had a 'few personal issues which had all come together on Christmas Eve'. 

'He made a number of threats to himself, to the property, to police,' Inspector Kuhn told reporters this afternoon.

Weapon: This is the shotgun the Gold Coast gunman used during today's siege

Today's dramatic events began  when officers were called to a disturbance on Anne St, Southport, around 11pm last night.

He then retreated to the unit where he remained for 12 hours. Authorities initially feared other people were inside the unit, although they now believe he was alone.

Police deployed a black Bearcat armoured police vehicle and a squad of camouflaged troopers.

The man's surrender followed tense telephone negotiations with officers. 

Inspector Bruce Kuhn told reporters earlier that police were concerned by the man's gunshots.

Train and light rail services were also suspended and traffic diverted from the area. 

In a statement, Queensland police said they were aware the incident might disrupt some people's festivities today. 

'While police understand that many people will soon be wishing to leave their homes and make their way to Christmas festivities, for their own safety, they are requested to stay inside until advised otherwise,' a spokesman said. 

Police have requested locals follow their directions throughout the siege. Authorities are hoping for a peaceful resolution.  

The 36-year-old is due to appear in the Southport Magistrates Court on Friday.
