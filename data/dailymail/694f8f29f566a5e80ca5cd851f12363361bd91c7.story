A former Ohio high school football player who was convicted of raping a West Virginia girl following an alcohol-fueled party and sentenced to  two years in custody has been released from juvenile detention.

WTOV-TV in Steubenville reports Trent Mays will now be given probationary status and will have a sex offender classification hearing.

A statement from attorney Adam Neeman says Mays earned his release and is now 'eager to prove himself.'

'The Mays family is elated to be reunited with their son after this trying ordeal. Trenton has excelled during his rehabilitative process, and has earned the right to be released. He is an extremely promising young man, eager to prove himself on behalf of his family and his community. The family would appreciate their privacy during this time together, which they have so longed for,' said the statement.

Mays and one of his Steubenville teammates, Ma'Lik Richmond, were found delinquent in the 2012 rape. Richmond had a one-year sentence and was released earlier.

A statement from the girl's family and their attorney says they hope the pair realize the pain they caused and maintain a higher moral standard in the future.

'We hope the guilty parties hold a higher standard of morals and values as their rehabilitation continues. We also hope that they realize the magnitude of lifelong pain that they have caused the victim and pray that the memory of their crimes lives in their souls as a constant reminder to treat women with dignity and respect,' said the statement.

Punished: Trent Mays and Ma'lik Richmond  sit in juvenile court in Steubenville, Ohio in March of 2013 around one year after they allegedly raped a 16-year-old girl at an alcohol fueled party 

In August 2012 the girl, then 16, was catastrophically drunk as she was dragged from one party ‘like a rag doll,’ digitally penetrated, stripped naked, abused and photographed face down on a basement floor.

The full horror of that night only came to light when pictures were shared via social media in a crime that appalled America.

In texts and tweets exchanged between the attackers and their friends Steubenville High School’s revered athletes crowed over the girl, denigrated her online and made her a victim twice over.

Video footage posted on YouTube showed former High School student Michael Nodianos on the night the crimes took place, laughing hysterically as he referred to the victim as ‘so raped right now.’ In a tweet posted that night he wrote, ‘Song of the night is definitely 'Rape Me' by Nirvana.’

Quarterback Mays and wide-receiver Richmond were convicted of rape and, in Mays’s case an additional charge of dissemination of nude images of a minor, last March.

Hearing: Trent Mays, 17, sits in the court room during a break on the fourth day of the juvenile trial in 2013 for he and co-defendant Ma'lik Richmond, 16, on rape charges in juvenile court in Steubenville, Ohio

Sentenced on year: Ma'lik Richmond reacts as the guilty  verdict is read in the juvenile court in Steubenville, Ohio March 17, 2013 when he was sentenced to one year 

They were tried as juveniles and though both were classified as Tier II sex offenders – the State’s second highest category - Mays was sentenced to two years detention and Richmond to just one year.

Both issued apologies to the victim's family during their 2013 sentencing but Trent Mays' apology was much less emotive than Richmond's. 

Mays merely apologized for taking and sending photos of the girl.

'No pictures should have been sent out, let alone been taken,' he said.

Richmond broke into tears apologizing for 'ruining the victim's life forever.'

One of the most shocking aspects of the crime which divided the small blue-collar town was, according to Police Chief William McCafferty, that ‘nobody had the morals to say, 'Hey stop it. This isn’t right.' Critics blamed a macho football culture in which star player were given free rein to run amok.

There were a wealth of incriminating tweets and photos including one which became the image of the case – the victim hanging limp between her attackers as they carry her by her wrists and ankles.

There was also a second alleged rape victim who was just 14 when she was manhandled by the 'Steubenville Rape Crew' months before the rape of the unconscious 16-year-old girl.

Off-the-record sources also say that the earlier alleged rape may have occurred in a football coach’s house.
