This is the moment thieves were caught on camera stealing a couple's charity Christmas lights display.

The brazen thieves, branded 'scum of the Earth' by their victims, were caught on CCTV helping themselves to about £200 worth of festive decorations, including a three-foot plastic Santa, a three-foot snowman and a large gnome.

Fundraisers Geoff and Tina Patchett, who have been decking out their home in Redcar, Teesside, with Christmas lights and decorations for years, condemned the thieves' actions and said they had 'stolen from the community'.

Mr Patchett, a retired process supervisor, has raised thousands of pounds for charity with the display outside the front of his house, and regularly stays up past midnight to guard his beloved decorations.

However, after he had gone to bed on Friday, the hooded thieves targeted the home at about 1.30am, and could be seen on CCTV raiding the display.

Dressed in hooded tops, one suspect - with a cigarette in his mouth - took the items, while another raided the garden while allegedly carrying wire cutters.

In the footage, the pair can be seen almost tiptoeing through the garden as they pick out which items to take before lifting them off the front lawn and onto the driveway. 

Mr Patchett, 68, said: 'I've spent a lot of time unravelling the CCTV over the weekend and I am confident someone out there will know who they are.

'They left the garden in a bit of a mess, I think they were spooked by someone because a few items that had been cut free were left behind.

'The Santa in particular will be easy to spot as you can't get them in the shops any more. It was donated to the display a couple of years ago by a passer-by.'

The couple, who between them have nine children, 21 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren, said they began decorating their home for the joy it brought to the community.

However, they turned it into an annual fundraising mission when people suggested they should raise money for charity. 

They have raised more than £3,000 over the years, including a record-breaking £1,166 last year for the Great North Air Ambulance.

With this year's display their biggest and best yet, the couple had hoped to raise more than ever for their chosen good cause, the Redcar Lifeboat.

Mr Patchett added: 'You try and do your bit for charity and then you get people like this ruining it for everyone. As much as this is for charity, it's for the kids to enjoy too.

'So whoever has done this has not only stole from us, but from the rest of the community. I just hope we catch them.'

The couple's display this year includes a few new attractions, including a parachuting Santa and a reindeer with sleigh. Mr Patchett said the whole collection has cost them 'thousands'.

Anyone who recognises the suspects, or has any information which could help Cleveland Police, should contact the force by calling 101.
