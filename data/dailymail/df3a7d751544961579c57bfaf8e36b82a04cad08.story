In 2011 the RAF launched an investigation into whether the first female Red Arrow, Flight Lieutenant Kirsty Stewart, was having an affair with squadron leader Ben Murphy but found no evidence of one.

But now the pair have both left the famous aerobatic flying team and are set to marry.

Ms Stewart, 36, joined the elite squadron, based at RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire, in 2010. Shortly afterwards rumours began circulating that she was seeing Mr Murphy, 38.

The gossip gathered so much momentum that in 2011 the RAF began an investigation into the matter.

The relationship was reportedly disrupting the dynamic of the team.

A source told The Sun: ‘The team as a whole became very unhappy and dysfunctional. Knowledge of the allegations went right to the top of the RAF.’

The investigation did not find any evidence of improper conduct, so the pair, who are both divorced, continued flying.

Mr Murphy left the Red Arrows not long after the RAF’s probe, and Ms Stewart, who flew as Red 9, left in March 2012 claiming to have been affected mentally by the deaths of two of the team’s pilots.

Flight Lieutenant Jon Egging, from Rutland, died when his plane crashed near Bournemouth Airport in Dorset in August 2011 and Flight Lieutenant Sean Cunningham died on November 8, 2011, when the ejection seat suddenly engaged while his Hawk T1 aircraft was still on the runway at RAF Scampton.

It’s understood that Ms Stewart and Mr Murphy are now living together. Sources told The Sun that she has ‘a big rock on her finger’.

Mr Murphy now works for defence and aerospace giant Lockheed Martin while Ms Stewart is still employed by the RAF, but in ground roles.
