MIT Students have built a working wooden rollercoaster for a rush week celebration.

Known as the East Campus Roller Coaster, the stunt has become a tradition among engineering students.

Freshmen are invited to ride the coaster strapped into a small buggy - with many braving it backwards.

Freshmen spent a week building the coaster, and over 400 people were able to ride it over a party weekend.

'After a hiatus of a few years, the roller coaster was brought back and was bigger and better than ever,' the students said.

The coaster was designed by three mechanical engineering juniors - Ben Katz, Jaguar Kristeller, and Wesley Lau - and built in the span of a week by the incoming freshmen, who were eventually allowed to ride it.

The ride was a huge success. 

'By the end, the total ride and reset time was under 3 minutes,' said Ben Katz, one of the engineers who built it.

'In total I'd estimate around 400 people were able to ride the roller coaster between Sunday night and Thursday afternoon, when we closed it down.'

 Katz also admitted he was the test pilot for the coaster.

'Once the plywood track had been laid down, we slowly rolled the cart along the track, so make sure it traveled smoothly, then we did an unmanned test run with an empty cart, followed by a test run with 150 lbs of sand in the cart.

'Then I got to go. This was my first time riding a roller coaster of any kind. It was awesome.'

However, the team admit they had to scale back their design - which originally featured a loop.

'Unfortunately, we had to scrap the loop,' they wrote in a blog post explaining the stunt.

'One of the steps to getting the coaster approved by MIT and Cambridge was going through MIT's Environment, Health and Safety department (EHS). 

'Basically, EHS said No Upside-Down People. Period.'

The initial design for the coaster included a loop - but MIT's health and safety department banned it

T g-forces riders would experience were also mapped out by the team before construction started. 'You'll see that, with the friction estimate used, G-forces actually go just barely negative at the top of the second hill,' the team said.

The team also admit the coaster did not last long.

'One big unknown pre-building was how the plywood track would hold up to repeated use, said Ben Katz.

'By the time we stopped doing rides, there were a couple small patches of plywood where the top ply had started falling apart.

'If we did want to run the roller coaster for longer, however, it would have been easy to replace just the top layer of plywood where it was wearing out.' 

Timber for the project was delivered on a monday, with freshmen beginning construction immediately.

By Tuesday, the frame had begun to take shape, and the first ride took place on Friday.

The school and city required they submit plans for their design to the Inspectional Services Department with a letter of recommendation from a certified engineering firm. 

Richard Henige, vice president of the Boston-based firm LeMessurier, said his company reviewed the drawings put together by MIT students building the roller coaster

'Students themselves developed the sketches and calculations, and at MIT's request we reviewed the sketches and made some comments to them. We then submitted a letter to the city saying that the plans would conform to the Massachusetts State Building Code,' he told Boston magazine. 

Based on the information forwarded by the engineers, the city deemed it a safe structure for campus use, and gave students the green light to begin building and have some fun.
