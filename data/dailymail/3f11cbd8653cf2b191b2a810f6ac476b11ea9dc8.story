If there was the opposite of the 'mile-high club' then this would be it as couples are being given the chance to romance each other inside a luxury hotel built inside a grounded aeroplane. 

Amorous partners can enjoy a unique runway stay at the Jumbo Stay Hostel, Stockholm, Sweden, and get the chance to play pilot and stewardess from the cockpit suite.

The converted Boeing 747-212B aircraft boasts 27 rooms and is currently located on the tarmac of Stockholm's Arlanda airport. It features all the usual mod-cons including TVs, wifi access, room service and passengers can even enjoy helicopter access.

Hotel owner Oscar Dios said: 'I was getting ready to expand my hostel business in 2006 when I heard about an old wreck of an aircraft for sale at Arlanda. 

'Since I had for a long time wanted to establish my business at Arlanda I didn't hesitate for a second when this opportunity struck. 

'The airplane, a decommissioned model 747-200 jumbo jet built in 1976, was last operated by Transjet, a Swedish airline that went bankrupt in 2002. 

'It was originally built for Singapore Airlines and later served with legendary Pan Am. 'In December 2007, Sigtuna authorities granted a building permit for establishing Jumbo Stay at the entrance to Arlanda airport. 

The most luxurious cockpit and ensuite rooms at the Jumbo Hostel boast their own en-suite facilities

There are 27 rooms on board the grounded aircraft, comprising singles and doubles

The plane-hotel offers not only views of the runway, but also of Stockholm itself, with balcony access

'In January 2008, the aircraft was moved to a construction site parking where the first phase of the conversion has begun with the dismantling of the old interior, new paint and new decorations for the rooms. Four hundred and fifty seats were taken out and the plane was sanitised in its entirety. 

'The hostel is built like any house, subjected to the same demands on climate control and isolation. 'It adheres to all common energy standard - heating is achieved with an air-air inverter.' 

The plane was towed to its final destination in 2008 at the entrance to Arlanda where it was placed on a concrete foundation with the landing gear secured in two steel cradles. Jumbo Stay is a spectacular landmark as a portal to Arlanda offering a view of the landing strip.

There are 27 rooms of different varieties on board the airplane. Dormitory, twin, 1-2-3, single (not en-suite) and family rooms rooms share shower and toilet facilities while the most luxurious cockpit and en-suite rooms boast their own facilities. 

Prices for the room, listed on GoUnusual.com, start from £100 per night.
