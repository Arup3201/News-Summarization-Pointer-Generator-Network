Tennis champ Andy Murray has taken to Twitter to complain about unfair treatment, appearing to accuse the public and media of favouring his rival, Rafael Nadal.

Third seed Nadal is being broadly applauded for the strength he showed when he battled through a cramp to claim victory over American Tim Smyczek on Wednesday.

Yet sixth seed Andy Murray has sent out a bitter tweet, which is a thinly-veiled swipe at his critics for their supposed double standards.

Murray claims that he was ridiculed after the US Open when he triumphed despite suffering a similar injury to Nadal.

Andy Murray has been dubbed 'Angry Murray' by fans after sending this tweet after Nadal's inspiring Round Three performance at the Australian Open

Rafael Nadal suffered crippling cramps during his play-off against American Tim Smyczek, but has been widely championed for his perseverance. The Spaniard went on to win in a four hour battle 

Andy Murray has pointed out that when he suffered muscle cramps in Round One of the 2014 US Open that he was allegedly called 'a drama queen'. He believes there are double standards amongst his critics

'When I cramped and won in the us open last year I was a "drama Queen, unfit, needs to see a shrink, faker" weird... (sic)' tweeted the Scot.

Many speculate this tweet was a reference to the support Nadal has received, who won his tense four-hour, five set play-off despite excrutiating cramps, following six months plagued by injuries.

Murray is quick to point out that he has also had his share of injuries, particularly in the US Open.

Just two sets into the match against Robin Haase in August last year Murray began to complain about crippling muscle pain. 

However, the World No.6 went on to win the match in four sets. 

'It’s not the worst I have ever felt necessarily, but it’s the worst I have ever felt after an hour and a half of a tennis match,' Murray said at the time after his first round victory.

Twitter users were quick to criticise Murray for his negativity.

'Angry Murray is at it again. #bitter #alwaysangry,' tweeted 'Wio'.

'your a sook that's underachieved because of a lack of heart .. Nadal is all heart (sic),' tweeted Cameron Byrne.

Others argued that Murray's claims about double standards were inaccurate. 

'But last year Nadal was booed loudly in the Aus Open final while he was in pain, so it is not just happening to you,' pointed out Peter Wong.

However, others supported Murray, claiming he is just 'sticking up for himself' and advising him to ignore his critics. 

'Just laugh at the jealous envious miserable gits Andy. But glad you spoke out champ. You're my hero,' tweet Maureen Stewart-Jones. 

Andy Murray is also through to the third round after overcoming Australian Marinko Matosevic in three sets on Wednesday. 

Tennis fans have keenly followed Nadal's Australian Open campaign following a turbulent six months, riddled with injuries.

Just two days before the Open began, Rafael Nadal declared that he isn't fit enough to win the tournament and revealed that his confidence has also taken a battering during his hiatus from the sport. 

'I would be lying if I say I feel that I am ready to win,' Nadal said in a news conference.

Asked what aspect of his game he was happiest with, Nadal replied: 'Nothing.'

The former World No.1 was quick to clarify that doubts are a natural part of the game. 

'Every time you come back, you have doubts, you have the feeling that you are far from your best,' Nadal said.

'The only thing I can say is I need to play better, yes. But the only way to play better is to win matches.' 

It has been a turbulent year for the 28-year-old, who was only able to return to training in December.  

Nadal was forced to withdraw from the US Open in August due to an injured right wrist which ultimately saw him sidelined for 13 weeks.

He returned in September for the China Open on September 30, but his hopes of a comeback were quickly shattered when appendicitis ended his 2014 season.

However, even after he was diagnosed with appendicitis Nadal refused to call it quits.

While suffering with crippling pain the 28-year-old managed to battle through the Shanghai Rolex Masters, depending on antibiotics until he could finally undergo surgery.
