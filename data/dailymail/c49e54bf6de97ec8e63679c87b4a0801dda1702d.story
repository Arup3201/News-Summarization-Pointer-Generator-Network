It was already shaping up to be one of the greatest missions this decade, but now Rosetta could turn out to be one of the most amazing space endeavours of all time.

Remarkable new photos have shown that its target, 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is actually what is known as a ‘contact binary’.

This means it is likely two comets stitched together, in what could turn out to be both a blessing and a curse for the spacecraft as it nears its approach.

Stunning images of the comet Rosetta is heading towards were released last month. Shown here, they reveal that the comet previously thought to be a single object actually has two parts. How these two parts came to be is not known, but more information will be gleaned in the next few months

According to the BBC, how the comet took this form is unknown.

A contact binary occurs when two celestial objects, such as asteroids or comets, slowly move towards each other until they are touching.

The slow approach of the two means they will form a single-oddly shaped body, rather than rebounding of one another.

Nine near-Earth objects are known to be contact binaries.

However, it is estimated that as many as 15 per cent of all near-Earth asteroids more than 650 feet (200 metres) in size are actually contact binaries.

It could have been fractured in the past or it could be two different objects that very slowly came into contact at speeds of a few metres per second.

What is certain, though, is that it poses some intriguing problems for Esa.

The most notable will be the planning landing of the Philae probe on its surface in November.

This will be the first cometary landed ever attempted - but now a decision will be made on what part of the comet to land on.

Irregardless, Rosetta is still planning to enter orbit around the comet on 6 August.

The orbit will gradually be lowered to 19 miles (30 kilometres) once the gravitational field of the comet is known - which could be more odd than expected given its shape.

The new observations suggest the comet is 2.2 by 2.5 miles (3.5 by 4 kilometres) in size, reports The Planetary Society's Emily Lakdawalla.

According to Philae navigator Eric Jurado, ‘navigation around such a body should not be much more complex than around a nucleus of irregular spherical type.’

But, he adds, ‘landing the Philae probe, however, could be more difficult, as this form restricts potential landing zones.’

The images taken by Rosetta reveal a two-lobed comet rather than the single comet expected. This could make a planned landing in November by the Philae probe more difficult.

Speaking to MailOnline Pedro Lacerda, astrophysicist at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research and part of the team analysing results of the Rosetta mission, said: '67P does seem to be made of two lumps.

'On one hand this is unexpected, because the shape model we had based on observations from Earth didn’t predict a binary structure. That just highlights the importance of these missions - they tell us more.

'On the other hand, three of the five comets previously visited by spacecraft seem to be composed of two chunks too, so it could be that binary comets are quite common.

'Now we need to find out what this is telling us. Is this a result of the way comets form, or is it a consequence of their evolution?

'Hopefully, Rosetta will point us to the answer. The Kuiper belt, where this comet is believe to originate, seems to have a very high fraction of binaries, up to 30 per cent depending on where you look, which is also interesting.

'It could be that many of these objects start out as binaries.

'In terms of the landing, I think the binary shape just raises more interesting questions.

'Where do we land so that we maximise the science return? Technically, it probably does not change much. The landing will be challenging no matter what.'

The Rosetta spacecraft launched in 2004 on a mission to study comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (artist's illustration shown). It will rendezvous with the comet later this month before entering orbit in August, becoming the first spacecraft to orbit a comet

Rosetta will seek to help scientists unlock the 
composition of comets and thereby understand more about the origins and 
evolution of our solar system.

The
 probe was launched in 2004 and has since travelled around the sun five 
times, picking up energy from Earth and Mars to line it up with its 
final destination: Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko.

For
 the coldest, loneliest leg of the mission, as Rosetta travelled out 
towards the orbit of Jupiter, the spacecraft was put into deep-space 
hibernation.

Rosetta will enter orbit around the comet in August, before putting its Philae lander onto the comet’s 
surface in November.

While 
in orbit it will perform extensive analysis of the comet's composition, 
which will provide us with an insight into the history of the solar 
system and discover the origin of comets.

Rosetta has been firing its thrusters to cut by almost two thirds the speed with which it's hurtling towards the comet.

There will be a total of four before Rosetta comes 
within 62 miles (100 kilometers) of the comet in early August, beyond 
the orbit of Mars.

The final rendezvous will require two more precision maneuvers.

The probe, launched a decade ago, will spend time observing 67P before dropping a lander called Philae onto its icy surface in November.

If the Philae 
lander is successful it will become the first vehicle ever to land on a 
comet.

The comet is about 2.5 miles (four kilometres) long and orbits the Sun every six-and-a-half years.

Once
 at the comet Rosetta will follow it on its journey around the sun, 
performing extensive studies of the coma and the surface.

The
 spacecraft's speed will be slowed in order to remain in orbit, bringing
 it to roughly about walking pace relative to the comet.

In November of this year the Philae lander will be sent to touch down on the surface of the comet (artist's illustration shown), which will be the first landing ever performed on a comet. Here, harpoons will be fired into the surface to keep it anchored while it studies its surroundings

The comet is heading towards the sun, so as it nears the star it will begin to melt more.

Even
 though it is still more than 370 million miles (600 million kilometres)
 from the sun - more than four times the distance between Earth and sun -
 its surface has already started to warm, causing its ices to turn to 
gas and escape from its rock-ice nucleus.

As the gas escapes, it also carries a cloud of tiny dust particles out into space, which slowly expands to create the coma.

The
 warming will continue as the comet moves closer to the sun and activity
 rises, and pressure from the solar wind will eventually cause some of 
the material to stream out into a long tail.

This will give Rosetta some fascinating opportunities to observe the comet's emissions and find out more about its composition.

Rosetta and the comet will be closest to the sun in August 2015, when they will be between the orbits of Earth and Mars.

On 25 Feb 2007 The Rosetta spacecraft returned this stunning image of Mars as it flew past the red planet on its way to the comet. The picture was taken by an imaging instrument on the Philae lander at a distance of 620 miles (1,000 kilometres). Below the solar array an area close to the Syrtis region is visible on the planet's disk
