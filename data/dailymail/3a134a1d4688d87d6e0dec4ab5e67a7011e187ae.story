Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s new bombproof BMW has been designed to withstand AK47 bullets and terrorist attacks but how does it stack up against the special security vehicles designed to protect the US President and the British prime minister?

The 7 Series High Security BMW vehicles will be replaced by the Prime Minister’s fleet of Holden VIP limos in a $6.2 million fight for the deal, The Daily Telegraph reports.

The fleet of luxury limousines will be ready for use at the G20 summit in Brisbane in November to transport the world leaders including US President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron who will be travelling in the comfort of temperature-controlled seats.

The BMW deal includes purchasing nine cars at a total of $4 million and an extra $2 million to lease up to two dozen more armoured vehicles for the G20.

The custom made security cars offer three levels of safety depending on your individual requirements designed to withstand a range of risk scenarios.

The vehicle is built to combat street crime with blunt objects and handguns up to a calibre of .44 Magnum, organised crime incidents which commonly involves the use of the AK-47 and attacks with explosive devices and armour-piercing weapons.

Mr Cameron's car also features heated and cooled rear massage seats

Although most details of President Obama’s car are classified for security reasons, the details that have been released are pretty impressive features despite the vehicle being criticised for poor maneuverability.

Referred to as - The Beast - by the Secret Service, the heavily-armoured vehicle has special night vision system in a secret location and special loops that replace the stock door handle for agents to hold on to when running alongside the car.

The Cadillac DTS is also sealed against biochemical attacks, carries an oxygen supply and there is even a blood bank of the president's blood type kept in the trunk.

The car is driven by a specially trained Secret Service agent who is capable of performing a J-turn.

British prime minister David Cameron’s jaguar is also equipped with an oxygen supply to protect from chemical and biological attacks and is understood to be capable of withstanding the blasts of the equivalent to 15 kg of TNT and a variety of other armour-piercing weapons.

The vehicle also features a 13 mm explosive resistant steel plate underneath the body, titanium- and Kevlar-lined cabins, armoured windows with bulletproof polycarbonate toughened glass, run flat-tyres and 'gun ports' to enable bodyguards to return fire at any attackers.

The car also boasts state-of-the-art communication and conferencing systems, high definition televisions, night vision, as well as adjustable, heated and cooled rear massage seats, and a surround-sound system.
