Mafia mobsters are suspected of being behind a massive cannabis farm found growing inside an abandoned 500-year-old Italian convent.

More than 100 plants were discovered in a raid by carabinieri paramilitary officers in the crypt of the building which is decorated with ornate frescoes.

Officials said they also discovered a sophisticated irrigation system as well as a lighting which had been illegally connected to a mains electric supply.

The discovery was made in the St Agata alla Guilla convent in the notorious Capo quarter of the city of Palermo on the island of Sicily, the spiritual home of the Mafia.

'Pungent': Carabinieri paramilitary officers inspect more than 100 cannabis plants found inside the crypt of a 16th Century convent on the island of Sicily that police believe were being grown by the mafia

Police said the plants were fully grown and when 'harvested' would have made more than €500,000 (£420,000) on the streets of the city and elsewhere across Sicily.

To access the indoor farm, police had to make their way through the building to an iron door which led to a further entrance down to the crypt where the cannabis plants were being grown.

Officers also discovered more than 100 empty black plastic plant pots which they suspected were being readied to transplant saplings from the plants so the cultivation would be multiplied several times over.

A police source who was involved in the raid said the air was 'thick with the pungent smell of the cannabis plants' and the atmosphere was 'hot and humid' due to the powerful lights that had been rigged up.

The 16th Century convent was abandoned more than 25 years ago and is dedicated to St Agatha, who is said to have lived in Palermo and is the patron saint of Sicily.

Much of the original ornate decorative plasterwork is still visible over the doors and archways and the walls also have faded murals on them depicting religious scenes.

For years, the convent was a retreat for prostitutes who wanted to give up working the streets and only four years ago Palermo city council put forward plans for a £700,000 restoration project for the building but the plans were not approved.

A Palermo police spokesman: 'The plants will be taken away, examined and then destroyed.

'Then the investigation will start into who was behind the farm which was extensive and which would have produced a large amount of drugs with a street value of six figures.

'There were more than 100 plants in the farm which were 150cm high and we also discovered several pots in an adjoining room which we believe were being prepared for further plants, as there were also dozens of bags of soil in the building.

'An irrigation system had been installed and the lighting camp from several lamps which had been rigged up illegally to the mains supply.

'It was an extensive operation and our belief is that it is connected to organised crime and a local Mafia family.'
