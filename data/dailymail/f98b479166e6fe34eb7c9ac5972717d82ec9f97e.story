The couple reeled in a whole lot more than they bargained for when they were lunged at by a 3.5-metre saltwater crocodile while beach fishing near Darwin in Australia's Northern Territory.

Caroline Cottam and Rodger Cooksley were fishing for barramundi at Gunn Point beach when Mr Cooksley spotted the huge crocodile's head breaking the surface about five metres off shore. The beast then vanished beneath the waves.

In what would prove a terrifyingly close call, Ms Cottam had turned to get more bait when the crocodile burst out of the water just a metre away from her.

'Five minutes before it appeared I was standing knee-deep in the water casting my line out,' Mr Cooksley told MailOnline.

'It came right out of the water onto the beach. That’s when I said to the missus "Don’t panic, but there's a crocodile next to you".

'I grabbed a stick and whacked the sand in front of its head and he kind of went back in. But he was stalking us. I’d say he was in the water for quite a while stalking us before we actually saw him.

'I’ve seen crocs a lot, but not like that. It really put the wind up us.'

Ms Cottam dropped her rod and the pair fled to their car. They watched the crocodile for another 30 minutes before it eventually moved off to a nearby creek.

Ms Cottam says she was part-excited, part-terrified by her close encounter.

'It was a pretty hairy experience,' she said.

'Rodger stayed cool, calm and collected and pretty much took it all in his stride. It hasn’t put me off fishing, that’s for sure. We will just make sure we are extra careful'

It's the second time in as many months a large crocodile has turned up on a Northern Territory beach, with the wildly popular Cable Beach in Broome closed for several hours last month after a four-metre crocodile was spotted surfing the breakers.
