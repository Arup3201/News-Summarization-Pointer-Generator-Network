For 30 years a campaign group has been tirelessly gathering photographs of the 58,286 American servicemen and women who died during the Vietnam War. 

Based in Washington, D.C. the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund was set up by a group of veterans who wanted to create a memorial from the American people for those who lost their lives during the conflict between 1965 and 1973.

The result was the 'Faces Never Forgotten' memorial - also known as The Wall - which shows the sheer magnitude of American casualties and serves as a place where family and friends of those who lost their lives can remember their loved ones.

U.S. Army Sgt. Bobby Joe Martinez from N.M., who is honored on Panel 58E, Row 23 of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. Sgt. Martinez was killed on May, 11, 1968 the province of Quang Tin Province, in South Vietnam

U.S. Marine Corps Pfc. James Michael Moore, from Albuquerque, N.M. Pfc. Moore is honored on Panel 25E, Row 74 of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. He was killed on August 3, 1967, in Quang Nam in South Vietnam

It has become one of the most visited memorials in the U.S. with an estimated 4.5million annual visitors a year. 

'Putting a face to every name is momentous,' said Jan C. Scruggs, founder and president of VVMF. 

'These men were real people, who had dreams and aspirations just like the rest of us. When you look at them you can truly humanise what The Wall represents.'

The mission of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund is to preserve the legacy of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and to educate people about the impact of the war.

Sgt James A Hardman was 21 when he was killed in action in Tay Ninh province in November 1968. The soldier was from Alameda County, California, and is honored on panel 38w, row 36 of the memorial

Ssgt Lester J Brantley from Portsmouth was 33 when he was killed in action in Binh Duong province in August 1969. He is honoured on panel 19w, row 76 of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial

The group is still raising money for an education centre which will display more than 400,000 items that have been left in tribute at the base of the wall since it opened. 

It is hoped the education centre will open in 2015 but in the meantime a searchable database has been created online which features a photograph of every service member who died during the conflict for The Wall of Faces memorial as they come in. 

A lot of the photographs are military pictures but the group would like family and friends to send in every-day shots of their loved ones.

Col. Warren Leroy Anderson, who served in the Air Force, is honoured on panel 6e, row 135 on the memorial. The 33-year-old, from Hillsdale County, in Michigan, was declared missing in action

SSGT Horace Earle Young from Mercer County, Illinois, served in the U.S. Army and died in 1965 aged 33

Tim Tetz, director of outreach for the memorial, told The Charlotte Observer: 'That picture tells a different story than the one in his (uniform) on the first day of training.

'It will drive home that that's who served and sacrificed in the war'. 

It is believed the Memorial Fund has photos for about 32,000 of the 58,286 service members they are looking for. It is its aim to have every photo by the time the education centre opens next year. 

So far only New Mexico has managed to gather a photograph for every one of its soldiers.

It began in 1955 and would continue until the fall of Saigon two decades later.The Vietnam War was a bloody Cold War-era conflict that claimed millions of lives and left countless soldiers and natives traumatised by what they had endured.

America's involvement in the region was triggered by one belief: that Communism was threatening to expand across the whole of South-East Asia.

This photograph was taken by German photojournalist and two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Horst Faas. It shows hovering U.S. Army helicopters pour machine-gun fire into the tree line to cover the advance of South Vietnamese ground troops as they attack a Viet Cong camp eighteen miles north of Tay Ninh, near the Cambodian border, March 1965

1955: In October, South Vietnam declared itself the Republic of Vietnam (RVN), with newly elected Ngo Dinh Diem as president. He would be executed in a coup eight years later.

1960: An opposing faction, The National Liberation Front (NLF) - also called the Viet Cong - was established there.

The NLF, along with and Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) in North Vietnam - under the leadership of Ho Chi Minh - wanted to impose a communist system over the whole nation.

The United States, in an attempt to prevent the spread of communism, trained the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) and provided military advisers to help fight Ho's guerillas.

1964: In August, a U.S. warship was attacked by North Vietnamese torpedo boats in the Gulf of Tonkin.

Weary: Soldiers from South Vietnam sleep on a U.S. Navy troop carrier following a four-day operation against the Viet Cong

This led Congress to pass the South-East Asia Resolution which allowed President Lyndon Johnson to conduct military operations in the region without a declaration of war.

1965: On March 2, U.S. aircraft started bombing targets in Vietnam and the first troops arrived.

1968: The North Vietnamese and Viet Cong launch the Tet Offensive, attacking about 100 South Vietnamese cities and towns.

On March 16, U.S. soldiers killed hundreds of Vietnamese civilians in the town of Mai Lai, later known as the Mai Lai Massacre.

By December, America's troops in Vietnam reached 540,000.

1969: In July, President Nixon ordered the first of many U.S. troop withdrawals from Vietnam.

1970: In April, Nixon announced that U.S. troops would attack enemy locations in Cambodia. This news sparked nationwide protests, especially on college campuses.

Horror: This iconic image shows police chief Nguyen Ngoc Loan about to execute Viet Cong officer Nguyen Van Lem on the street in Saigon

Agent Orange: War crimes are said to have been committed by both sides and one of the most controversial aspects of the U.S. military effort was the widespread use of Agent Orange - which still damages crops and is said to cause disease in Vietnam today.

America's military dumped 20million gallons of the dioxin - which has been linked to cancer, birth defects and other disabilities - and other herbicides on about a quarter of South Vietnam between

1962 and 1971, decimating about five million acres of forest.

1972: After years of fighting and agonising negotiations, Nixon ordered the Christmas bombings.

Agony: A wounded paratrooper grimaces in pain as he awaits medical evacuation from base camp in the A Shau Valley

That offensive paved the way for Nixon's Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to negotiate the January 1973 peace accords that called for a cease-fire and the release of prisoners, some of whom had been in captivity for nearly six years.

1973: U.S. troops are withdrawn.

1974: After a brief period of peace, North Vietnam recommenced hostilities.

1975: North Vietnamese captured Saigon on April 30, forcing South Vietnam’s surrender and reuniting the country with a one-party communist government.

Aftermath: The Hanoi government estimate that in 20 years of fighting, 4million civilians were killed across North and South Vietnam and a further 1.1million communist fighters died.

U.S. estimates claim that between 200,000 and 250,000 South Vietnamese soldiers were killed and more than 58,000 U.S. soldiers died or were missing in action when the final troops pulled out.

The war itself gathered heavy opposition in the States and soldiers have since recalled being told by superiors to remove their uniforms before landing back home to avoid being accosted by campaigners.

Vietnam finally normalised relations with the U.S. in 1995.
