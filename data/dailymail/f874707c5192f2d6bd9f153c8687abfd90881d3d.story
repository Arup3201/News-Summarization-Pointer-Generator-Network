A four-year old boy is hoping a liver transplant will ease a rare condition which causes him to feel like he is being eaten alive by mosquitoes.

Aarron Higgins suffers from a life-threatening genetic disease called Alagille Syndrome which affects his vital organs and makes his skin unbearably itchy.

The condition, which affects just one in
100,000 children, cannot be cured - but a liver transplant would 
permanently ease the itching.

Aarron suffers from unbearable itching due to his syndrome, which causes a build-up of bile in his liver

Soon after Aarron was born, he developed a rare form of jaundice, which kick-started his itchiness.

After a year-long series of tests, 
specialists finally managed to diagnose him with rare Alagille Syndrome,
which causes a build-up of bile in his liver, setting off the itching.

It is believed only a liver transplant will be able to permanently cure his condition.

The brave youngster has had 15 operations, including open heart surgery, but his immune system is so weak that he constantly picks up infections.

Aarron, of Baillieston, Glasgow, will be assessed next month by liver specialists from King's College Hospital in London to see if he is suitable for a transplant.

His mother Jacqueline, 40, said: 'The itching is horrendous. It just gets worse and worse.

'When he is itching he gets completely frustrated. No matter how much he scratches it never goes away. He throws things and lashes out.

'It's heartbreaking. When it's really
bad he stands at the top of the stairs screaming "mummy, help me", with
blood pouring from his legs or ears or wherever.

'It's in his nose, his ears, places he can't even scratch. He can't sleep and he can't stand the heat.

Alagille syndrome is a life-threatening genetic disorder that causes a loss of the bile ducts within the liver during the first year of life.

This leads to a buildup of bile in the liver, causing damage to liver cells. Scarring may occur and lead to cirrhosis in about half of affected children.

Symptoms including jaundice, loose stools and poor growth develop within the first three months of life.

Later, there is persistent jaundice, itching, fatty deposits in the skin and stunted growth. The disease can stabilise between four and 10.

It affects around one in 100,000 children.

Children with the condition tend to have a prominent, broad forehead; deep-set eyes; a straight nose; and a small pointed chin.

Treatment of Alagille syndrome focuses on trying to increase the flow of bile from the liver.

Problems with fat digestion and absorption may lead to deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). Deficiencies of these vitamins can be diagnosed by blood tests and can usually be corrected by large oral doses.Â 

Occasionally, liver cirrhosis advances to a stage where the liver fails to perform its functions. Liver transplantation is then considered.

Alagille syndrome is generally inherited only from one parent and there is a 50 per cent chance that each child will develop the syndrome. Half of cases occur spontaneously.

'He has got a vest, leggings, socks, mitts and a wee balaclava but he is still itching.

'It
comes in waves. He can have a few weeks without it, as it depends on 
the amount of bile, and when he is not itching he is fine. He is 
swinging from the lampshades.

'He has got a great spirit. He is a right wee mischief. When I look at him it makes it all worthwhile.

'I think they are going to have to transplant him. It won't cure the condition but it would stop the itching for good.

'It is a hard decision but I think in the long run it will be better for him. The itching is the main problem he has with quality of life.'

Young Aarron prefers the cooler weather of winter as it soothes his itching.

Just before Christmas he was treated to a trip to Disneyland, Paris, after a friend contacted the Starlight Children's Foundation on his behalf.

The four-year-old loves Disney and said his dearest wish was to visit 'Donald Duck land'. The family were put up in a luxury Sequoia Lodge hotel, went on lots of rides and met some of Aarron's favourite characters. The youngster was also able to go swimming for the first time in three years.

'Aarron had a really magical time and he thinks Mickey Mouse is his best friend now,' Ms Higgins said.

'It made him so much more cheery in the run-up to Christmas and made it a really exciting and special time for us.'

She added: 'Aarron's body fights hard every day to keep going and we fight along with him. He is such an inspiration.'
