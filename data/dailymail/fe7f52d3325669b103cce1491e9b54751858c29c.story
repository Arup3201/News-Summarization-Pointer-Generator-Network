The Arizona Cardinals edged closer to a play-off spot with a 12-6 win in St Louis, but they were forced to play their fourth quarterback of a bruising season.

Drew Stanton injured his right knee during a sack by Aaron Donald midway through the third quarter with Ryan Lindley making his first appearance since 2012.

Starter Carson Palmer was ruled out for the season with a torn ACL during last month's 31-14 win over St Louis and history repeated itself with a rueful-looking Stanton carted off for tests.

Cardinals head coach Bruce Arians said after the game that the team will await further tests to determine how serious the injury is.

'We know he has a knee injury,' he said. 'We have no idea what the extent of it is. He's had a knee injury before, so there's not any knowledge whatsoever with him. We'll take it very slow with him and see how it goes, once we get the MRI and more information.'

The Rams allowed points for the first time in more than nine quarters as Chandler Catanzaro kicked the first of four field goals early in the second.

Despite Stanton's injury and a forgettable performance from Lindley, who completed four out 10 passes for 30 yards, Arizona's stout defense limited the Rams to two Greg Zuerlein field goals and ended a two-game losing streak.

The defeat draws a line under the Rams' unlikely play-off hopes, while the banged-up Cardinals welcome NFC West rivals Seattle Seahawks to Pheonix next week.
