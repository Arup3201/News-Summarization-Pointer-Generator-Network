Scotland Yard conspired to cover up the true extent of phone hacking at the News of the World, it was claimed at the Leveson inquiry today.

Former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott accused police of a 'conspiracy of silence to hide the facts'.

In a sworn witness statement, he suggested they withheld information after repeatedly telling him they had no evidence his voicemail was illegally accessed.

'Cover-up claims': Lord Prescott, left, and Brian Paddick arrive at the Leveson Inquiry which heard allegations that the Metropolitan Police attempted to 'hide the facts' about phone hacking

But as early as 2006 detectives had questioned private 
investigator Glenn Mulcaire about the alleged hacking of the phone of 
Lord Prescott's chief of staff, the Leveson inquiry heard.

It was not until last year that Scotland Yard finally admitted that his aide Joan Hammell's messages may 
have been targeted.

The Labour peer has since agreed a Â£40,000 payout from the News of the World for phone hacking.

And on a dramatic day, Brian Paddick, a former Acting Assistant Commissioner, said it was possible evidence could be 'covered up', in his own sworn statement.

Questioned: Glenn Mulcaire was asked in 2006 why he had the mobile phone number and pin for Lord Prescott's chief of staff in documents

Mr Paddick said he 'found it difficult' to have 'confidence' in current investigations.

He suggested that the phone hacking probe should be led by another police force.

In his statement, he said: 'I find it difficult to have confidence in the current investigations, despite having the utmost respect for the senior investigating officer, Sue Akers, since the police are investigating themselves and are relying on the voluntary co-operation of News International in order to make progress.'

'It leaves open the possibility that should evidence severely damaging to both the reputation of the Metropolitan Police and News International be discovered, such as the collusion of very senior officers or those at the highest levels in News International, it could be covered up to the benefit of both parties.'

Mr Paddick, who retired from the police in 2007 and is now a Liberal Democrat politician who wants to be Mayor of London, added: 'It is essential, in my view, that independent scrutiny and oversight of the investigation is introduced or that the investigation is led by a police force not so far implicated in the current investigations.'

The inquiry learnt Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator working for the News of the World, was asked as early as August 2006 why he had documents containing a mobile phone number and pin for Lord Prescott's chief of staff.

A Scotland Yard detective asked him: 
'Another page here, this has got the name John Prescott. There is 
another name underneath, first of all it says adviser and then the name 
Joan Hammell... Have you got that information to access John Prescott's 
network or that of his adviser?'

Mulcaire replied: 'No comment.'

Despite this, when the Labour politician asked the Metropolitan Police in 2009 whether his mobile had been hacked he was told there was no evidence this was the case.

Lord Prescott suggested police had withheld information from him.

He pointed out that he had regular dealings with former senior Met officer Andy Hayman, who was in ultimate charge of the original phone hacking investigation in 2006.

'He (Mr Hayman) was the man I was working with, and he might have just said to me, "watch your phone", he said.

'I was beginning to feel they were hiding things, not telling me the truth.'

Referring to the police, the former Deputy Prime Minister added: 'These are highly-paid, highly-intelligent people.

'I think there was more a conspiracy of silence to hide the facts and frankly I am stronger of that view in the last few months.'

Mulcaire and the News of the World's royal editor, Clive Goodman, were jailed in January 2007 after pleading guilty to intercepting voicemail messages left on royal aides' phones.

Lord Prescott also criticised the close relations between British politicians and News International owner Rupert Murdoch and his executives.

He said: 'It's not exactly corruption, and I'm not accusing them of that, but they do have interests, they do have power.

'And in the Murdoch press, it's particularly organised to achieve that, so they have good relations.'

Referring to Mr Murdoch, he added: 'He's not interested in the dinners, is he? He just wants what he wants - that is selling newspapers and influence over political parties and playing a part in influencing the politics.'
