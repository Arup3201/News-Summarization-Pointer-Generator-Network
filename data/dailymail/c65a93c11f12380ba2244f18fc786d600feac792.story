The UK's only female giant panda has passed her due date and experts fear ‘bad news’ regarding her pregnancy, it was revealed today.

Experts at Edinburgh Zoo said Tian Tian should have gone into labour over the weekend but hormone tests suggested ‘something might be amiss’.

However, the zoo said there is ‘still a chance’ she could give birth to a live cub as her progesterone levels have not yet returned to base level.

The UK's only female giant panda: Tian Tian, who has passed her due date at Edinburgh Zoo

She is still showing some of the 
behaviour typical of a pregnant panda, although scientific data from the
 urine analysis of her hormones is becoming more atypical, the zoo said.

The
 zoo announced two weeks ago that Tian Tian was thought to be pregnant 
and could give birth by the end of August and she has been closely 
monitored ever since.

She was artifically inseminated on April 13 after she and her intended partner Yang Guang failed to mate naturally.

Iain
 Valentine, director of giant pandas for the Royal Zoological Society of
 Scotland, said: ‘As you are all probably aware, giant panda Tian Tian 
is now past her due date and the evidence suggests that this may be bad 
news.

‘She is still 
displaying some of the behaviours of a pregnant panda, but the 
scientific data from the urine analysis of her hormones is becoming more
 atypical.

'There is still a chance she will give birth to a live cub as 
her progesterone levels have not yet returned to base.

Problems: Tian Tian was supposed to give birth by the end of August - but there has been bad news

‘I must stress, as there has been a lot in the news recently about pandas "faking" it, that this was definitely not a pseudo or phantom pregnancy.

‘The
 results of cutting-edge scientific analysis have shown that, across the
 entire pregnancy, Tian Tian had the profile of a pregnant panda likely 
to carry to full term.

'We are working with the very best panda experts 
in the world and they were all in agreement. The
 scientific data extracted by analysing hormones and proteins in her 
urine was a text book example of what we wanted to see.

‘However,
 at the very end of last week there were one or two results from the 
hormone tests that were atypical and that was the first sign something 
might be amiss.

‘Although it
 is still very new, the scientific data does suggest that the last point
 she should have gone into labour was over the weekend. Unfortunately 
this did not happen.’

The 
zoo said its experts continue to monitor Tian Tian closely and will know
 more towards the end of the week as her cycle comes to an end.

Tian Tian (Sweetie) and male Yang Guang (Sunshine) are the first giant pandas to live in the UK for 17 years.

The animals, now both aged 10, arrived on loan from China in December 2011 and will remain at Edinburgh Zoo for a decade.

Tian
 Tian was successfully inseminated last year but lost her cub at late 
term. The attempt was the first artificial insemination procedure to 
take place on a giant panda in the UK.

She was again inseminated in April and the zoo confirmed in July that she had conceived but was not yet technically pregnant.

Experts said it would not be known for certain if she was pregnant until she gave birth.
