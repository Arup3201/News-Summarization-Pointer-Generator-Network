‘SEXPO, PLEASE DON'T JOKE ABOUT RAPE. As a presenter at Sexpo 2014 waking up to THIS this morning was a rude awakening indeed,’ she wrote in a Twitter post.

Columnist Clementine Ford added: ‘Woah. Seriously? A rape joke? Not okay Sexpo.’

Another Twitter user said: ‘Surprise jokey rape culture is the worst thing to wake up to. Especially from Sexpo. Shame on you. Why is this still up?’
