 Los Angeles Clippers star Blake Griffin is facing a misdemeanor battery charge stemming from a scuffle with a man at a Las Vegas Strip nightclub, according to court records obtained Wednesday.

The main claims Griffin grabbed him by the neck and slapped him after he took the NBA great's picture.  

The 25-year-old Griffin is due for arraignment December 8 before a Las Vegas justice of the peace on a charge that could get him up to a year in jail if he is convicted.

The criminal complaint was filed Friday, and a summons was issued for his arrest.

The Clippers were aware of the complaint, team spokesman Seth Burton said, but had no immediate comment.

It wasn't immediately clear if Griffin had a Las Vegas lawyer handling the case.

Las Vegas police said last month that they were investigating a man's claim that Griffin attacked him early Oct. 19.

The complaint lists the victim as Daniel Schuman. An attempt to reach Schuman by telephone wasn't immediately successful.
