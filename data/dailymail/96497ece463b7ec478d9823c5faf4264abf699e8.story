The American Family Association, who recently said that God is going to use ISIS to punish the United States for being tolerant of LGBT people, have created a 'hate list' of groups they say defy their own beliefs, including atheists, humanists and pro-gay rights groups.

The fundamentalist organization - notorious for its opposition to homosexuality and same-sex marriage, abortion and pornography - has formatted the list on their website, calling it the 'anti-Christian bigotry map', saying those listed are 'deeply intolerant' to their faith and want 'to silence Christians and to remove all public displays of Christian heritage and faith in America'.

The non-profit - based in Tulepo, Mississippi - has even targeted leading social justice organizations, such as the Human Rights Campaign (HRC),  the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and the Southern Poverty Law Center and People for the American Way, for the map. 

Evangelical churches were not featured on the list just because they are in agreement that homosexuality is a sin, religious website Patheos noted.

'Hate list': The American Family Association, a fundamentalist Christian non-profit, has released this interactive map on their website, allowing followers to identify what the AFA says are groups that are 'deeply intolerant towards the Christian religion' and some who have 'committed violent crimes against Christians and faith-based groups'

Key: The website allows users to navigate the map according to which 'hate group' they want to find

The map appears to be a reaction to a list of 'hate groups' released by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

The AFA has been on that list, something they have called 'slanderous'.

The Southern Poverty Law Center says those identified 'have beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics'.

However the groups that  feature on the AFA map don't seem too bothered.

On their website, the HRC wrote in response: 'We, as well as the rest of the LGBT community, will be able to find each other and unite as 'advocates for the legalization and promotion of same-sex marriage'. Hurrah!'

The organization also pointed out some apparent inaccuracies in the map. 

'Unfortunately, however, we will be not be able to meet at HRC’s offices in North Dakota, Dallas and Austin that are included on the AFA’s map, because they don’t exist. Gosh darn.'

However the AFA remained defiant in standing up for their cause.

'Some members or supporters of these groups (on the map) have committed violent crimes against Christians and faith-based groups,' the organization said.

'Physical and profane verbal assaults against Christians are methods frequently exercised in their angry methods of intimidation.' 

Tim Wildmon, the son of the American Family Association's founder, Reverend Donald Wildmon, is the current President. 

The AFA promotes itself as 'one of the largest and most effective pro-family organizations in the country'.

The organization recently spoke out in support of Uganda’s passing an anti-gay law that calls for LGBT Ugandans or anyone 'promoting' homosexuality to be jailed, potentially for life.
