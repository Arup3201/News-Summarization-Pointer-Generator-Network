Tottenham Hotspur are willing to make an offer for Burnley striker Danny Ings in this window but Sean Dyche is hopeful the England Under 21 international will still see out his contract.

Leicester City have already bid £8million for the 22-year-old but the prospect of moving to Tottenham now is more tantalising. 

Burnley would still make £3m in compensation should Ings leave at the end of his deal in the summer but the player is having to consider whether Tottenham will move on to other targets by that stage.
