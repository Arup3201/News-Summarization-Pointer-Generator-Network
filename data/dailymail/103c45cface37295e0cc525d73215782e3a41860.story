A chocolate, appearingly deflated football has raised $20,000 for a Pennsylvania charity. 

Amid the bitter 'deflate-gate' scandal surrounding the New England Patriots, Pennsylvania candy company Sarris Candies decided to find the sweet side of the situation -- literally.

Bill Sarris had his staff at Sarris Candies make the chocolate football with a dent in its side -- to make it look like a deflated football -- and posted a photograph of it to Facebook just for laughs.

The caption with the photo reads: 'Chocolate 'Bradie' Ball Net weight 13 lbs.... Oops! We meant 11.2 lbs.'

What started as a small joke has brought in big bucks for the Dollar Energy Fund -- a fund providing utility assistance for residents in need, according to FOX. 

The ball was auctioned off Friday with a local car dealer bidding $5,000 and Sarris matching the bid, CBS reports. 

Utility companies that support the fund matched the $10,000 bringing the total to $20,000.

'It's going to a good cause, so that's the best thing,' Sarris said.

Offers: After Sarris posted the photo, the company received multiple offers to buy the one-of-a-kind sculpture prompting Sarris to auction it off with the help of a local radio station

Sarris Candies, located about 18 miles outside of Pittsburgh in Canonsburg, is known for its sweet Super Bowl specialties, but this deflated delicacy was not originally for sale, FOX reports.

After Sarris posted the photo, he told CBS, the company received multiple offers to buy the one-of-a-kind sculpture prompting Sarris to auction it off with the help of a local radio station.

Sarris wouldn't reveal how his staff achieved the football's deflated look, according to the Huffington Post, instead he said 'You'll have to ask the Patriots how they did it.'
