Detroit Lions defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh has had a one-game suspension rescinded, making him eligible for Sunday's NFC wildcard game against the Dallas Cowboys.

Appeals officer Ted Cottrell reduced the discipline to a $70,000 fine, the NFL announced on Tuesday, after Suh could be seen stepping on the left leg of Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers during the fourth quarter of Sunday's regular season finale.

This as the wife of Detroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford called out the league for suspending Suh, pointing out that a member of the Green Bay Packers stepped on her husband during the game and there was no punishment.

Kelly Hall took to Instagram on Tuesday as she referenced an article from The Detroit News that pointed out her husband too had been stepped on during the game, writing; 'Thank you. Pretty sure Matthew's leg looks a lot damn worse right now from when he got stepped on/cleated in the same game. But it wasn't Suh.. And he's not Aaron Rodgers, so no one would think twice about it.' 

Suh on Monday was suspended by the league for one game for violating safety-related playing rules prohibiting unnecessary roughness. 

With Rodgers in a defenseless posture, Suh backed up and stepped on the quarterback's leg with his right foot before repeating the move with his left foot in a display of "unnecessary roughness", the NFL said in a statement on Monday.

'Unnecessary roughness': Ndamukong Suh deliberately stepped on Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers' ankle during Sunday's Lions-Packers game, the NFL ruled

'You did not respond in the manner of someone who had lost his balance and accidentally contacted another player who was lying on the ground,' Merton Hanks, the NFL's vice president of football operations, said.

'This illegal contact, specifically the second step and push off with your left foot, clearly could have been avoided.'

Suh has a long history of player-safety violations.

Cottrell is jointly appointed by the NFL and NFL Players Association to hear and decide appeals for on-field player discipline.
