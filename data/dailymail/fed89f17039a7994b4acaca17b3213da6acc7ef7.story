It is famed as an iconic weekend break destination – especially at this time of year, when its Fringe and Art Festivals turn it into a colourful mass of laughter and cool culture.

Throw in some of Britain’s best-loved tourist sights – the historic stretch of the Royal Mile; the 12th century Castle rising high on its bluff; the rearing hilltops of Arthur’s Seat – and you have a splendid location that pulls in holidaymakers in their thousands.

Pretty damn steep: Edinburgh has great scenery, in the form of Arthur's Seat - but a visit may cost you

But tourists heading to Edinburgh this summer will have to pay for the privilege – as, according to a new survey, the city is the most expensive in Britain for a mini-break.

According to research released by reviews website TripAdvisor, the Scottish capital is the priciest of 20 key UK cities when it comes to both the cost of a four-star hotel room and a one-night break (with accommodation, pre-dinner drinks, meal for two and a taxi home).

Edinburgh topped the poll for the average price of a four-star hotel booking, at £207.51 for a single night’s stay – proving over £20 more costly than its nearest competitor Brighton (£180.12) and over £30 higher than third-placed Cambridge (£173 per night).

Perhaps surprisingly, TripAdvisor’s statistics suggest that London is only the fourth most expensive city in the UK when it comes to the fee for a four-star hotel – with the average price for a one-night stay revealed as £159.94, almost £50 less costly than Edinburgh.

Edinburgh also headed the list when it came to the overall price of a one-night break. The combined tally for a night’s holiday in the city – including hotel, two dry martinis to start the evening, a meal of steak and chips with a bottle of house wine for two, and a cab back to the hotel at the end of the evening – leaves just small change from £300, at £298.46.

Daylight robbery: Cambridge (left), with its famous university and studious atmosphere, is also ranked as a costly option for a UK break - but Nottingham, the 'home' of Robin Hood (right), is listed as the best-value city

Visitors can find slightly better value in second-placed Cambridge, where the same price equation came up with a total sum of £275.32, and in fourth-placed Brighton, where you are likely to pay £261.41 – exactly £3 less than third-placed London, at £264.41.

However, holidaymakers visiting Britain – or spreading their wings within it – can find better deals if they look to some of the country’s less heralded weekend-away options.

Nottingham – home to the legend of Robin Hood and the lovely open space of Wollaton Park – is apparently the UK’s cheapest major city for a mini-break. A one-night stay in a four-star hotel will set you back an average £73.21 – nearly enough for three nights in Edinburgh – while the full cost of the stay, with food and drink, tallies to ‘just’ £164.73.

Other ‘bargain’ possibilities include Cardiff (£81.87 for a four-star hotel room, £167.51 for a complete one-night package), Sheffield (£83.86 for the hotel, £175.81 overall), Leeds (£83.82 per room, £179.59 in all) and Bristol (£84.85 and £180.32 respectively).

The figures also suggest that Birmingham has grown in popularity as a getaway possibility in the last 12 months – and has raised its prices to match.

The Midlands metropolis – with its 
dramatic industrial heritage, numerous canals, rising restaurant scene 
and lively nightlife – was ranked as the best-value option in the survey
conducted in 2012, when a complete-package one-night break was 
available for £139.54.

Canal plus: Birmingham, with its restored industrial heritage, is another cheap option - though rising in price

Twelve months on, that figure has leapt to £183.82 – although that still leaves Birmingham as the sixth cheapest city for a UK mini-break in 2013, according to the poll.

“With the great summer we’ve been enjoying, staycations are sure to be a popular choice for UK travellers over the August bank holiday,” says TripAdvisor’s James Kay.

“But where you go will have a big impact on how much you are likely to spend.

“Generally, the further north you go, the less you need to fork out for hotels and dinner.

“But there are some notable exceptions to that rule. So make sure you plan ahead.”
