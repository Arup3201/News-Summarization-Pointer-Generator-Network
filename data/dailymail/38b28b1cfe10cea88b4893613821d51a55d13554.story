A grandfather who knew his Frozen-loving granddaughter was disappointed when it failed to snow as much as forecasters had predicted delivered her a truck of snow so she could build a snowman.

Allen Queen, from Providence, Rhode Island, had the idea after his home was battered with winter weather, pushing back a trip to see his four-year-old granddaughter in Glen Burnie, Maryland.

The little girl, Sophia White, had been sad that she hadn't received as much snow as her grandfather, her mother Nicole told the Capital Gazette. 

Dream come true: Four-year-old Sophia White is pictured with the snowman she built in Maryland after her kind-hearted grandfather delivered her a truck of snow that he drove from his home in Rhode Island

'As the storm came, or rather didn't come, and I was talking to my dad on the phone I casually mentioned to him that I wished I could teleport Sophia up to him with his 18 inches of snow since all she wanted to do was build a snowman,' she said. 

So the kindhearted grandfather, known to his granddaughter as 'Poppy', borrowed a front-loader from his employer  and used it to fill the bed of his truck with snow.

Then he started the nearly 400 mile journey south. 

'When he got here, he had a tarp over the back of his truck, and I kept asking what was in the back,' White said. 'He just kept telling me not to worry about it - it was something for work.'

He had planned to surprise Sophia right away but when he arrived, the area was being battered by rain and he didn't want her experience to be ruined - so he waited until the skies cleared.

Good thinking: Allen Queen used his employer's front loader to fill up the bed of his truck with snow after learning that his granddaughter was disappointed that she couldn't build a snowman in Maryland

Surprise! After driving nearly 400 miles, he shoveled it out onto her lawn with the help of her father

When he finally told White, she put Sophia in her Elsa costume from the movie 'Frozen' and allowed the youngster to stay home from school so that she could play in the snow.

With the help of Sophia's father, Julius White, Queen shoveled out the snow and the little girl could finally get to work on her snowman. 

'Everything else in the neighborhood has melted and is pretty dry,' White said. 'Then there's just this random snowman in our yard. He's a little shorter than he was, but he's still there.'

Glen Burnie received an inch of snow during last week's snowstorm, while Providence was lumped with more than a foot.
