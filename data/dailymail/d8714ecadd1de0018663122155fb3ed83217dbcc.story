Mothers with 19 children between them who receive tens of thousands in handouts every year claim they are stuck on benefits and are forced to live off the state because they would be worse off if they went back to work.

The women claim they have been told by Jobcentres there are no options for them because the cost of childcare for their many offspring would not be met by their wages.

They live in privately rented homes which they are unable to pay for themselves and say they cannot get on council housing lists because they have too many children or face waiting lists running into years.

Clare Bache is a mother of seven and says she feels trapped on benefits and the Government should pursue absent fathers, she is  with five of her children - left to right - Huey, Charlie, Luke, Charlotte and Anthony

Each of the women will tell their stories on the Channel 5 documentary Benefits: 19 Kids And Counting The Cost, tonight.

Clare Bache has seven children and receives benefits of around £35,000 a year but said she is stuck on benefits and believes the Government needs to pursue absent fathers rather than penalise single parents and think they enjoy living off the state. 

She said: 'Where can I get a job that earns me more than that?'

Her six bedroom house in Birmingham is paid for almost entirely by benefits and she has not worked in 20 years. 

Ms Bache said anyone who believes living on benefits is easy is 'wrong.' 

She said: 'The hardest thing is being able to provide for my kids. I can't go out and earn that money.

'The fathers don't provide for their own kids. It's about time the Government cracked down on parents like that. It's all very well pointing a finger at single parents, but what about absent parents?'

Struggling with bringing up and providing for seven growing children on her own, the 40-year-old admitted she owes about £12,000 in gas and electric bills, which she has avoided paying in various homes she has lived in.

She is trying to get a debt release order to cover the cost, but she admitted 'otherwise I will keep avoiding it.' 

Lisa Rolfe is a mother of seven and claims the job centre told her it was impossible for her to get a job 

Ms Rolfe said her partner Paul Orgill, who is also on benefits for his health problems, is the bigger burden

Ms Bache lives in a three-storey home which costs £725 a month in rent, which is paid for almost entirely by housing benefits.  

She complains about broken parts of the house - including a leaking shower, kitchen cupboards that are too small and half the power sockets not working.

Lisa Rolfe, 36, is also a mother of seven and has an extra burden because she has to care for her partner Paul Orgill, who has health problems.

Miss Rolfe’s children are aged between one and 19. Three are from her relationship with Mr Orgill, 40, who has now had a vasectomy to ensure they have no more.

She lives with six of her children in a five-bedroom home which is full of gadgets, games consoles and six huge flat-screen televisions, while the seventh child stays with her ex-husband.

Ms Rolfe receives £650 a week in handouts. She said her electricity and gas bills for the family run into £40 or £50 every week and they often have to resort to the emergency fund to tide them over for an evening - or at least allow her sons to continue to play their XBox.

She said: 'We've got bills, bills, bills, bills. We never do it. We are always behind on something.' 

Despite this, they happily show off their gadgets, including an iPad and six TVs costing up to £1,100 each – although at least one is thought to have been bought by Mr Orgill’s parents. 

He tells viewers the items were paid for partly out of £20,000 compensation he received for a past incident. Asking them not to judge him, he says: ‘It’s taken a long time to collect all this nice stuff.’

Mr Orgill has not worked for ten years and spends his days playing poker in the hope he will win 'millions'

Ms Rolfe, 36, said surviving on benefits is a struggle but it would be impossible for her to go out to work 

In one scene, the house runs out of electricity, leaving the eldest sons distraught that their Xboxes do not work.

In spite of these struggles, Ms Rolfe - who has not worked in 12 years - still does not want help to find work.

She was asked to go to the Jobcentre about finding work but said they could do nothing to help her and branded the experience a 'waste of time'.

Even before going, she said: ‘I don’t know what they are going to do. 

'They are going to look into getting me back into work, which is absolutely impossible because I’ve got people to look after. Good luck to them.’ 

After the meeting, she said: 'They told me "you won't get working tax credits, you won't get child care. We won't bother doing a job search, there's nothing here for you."

'"Come back when all your children are at school."' 

Speaking last night, she added: ‘I was angry they couldn’t help. I filled out this survey about what I thought about benefits, and they asked us to be on the show.

‘I would do anything to help us get off benefits but there just isn’t the work out there.’

Despite having seven children, Ms Rolfe said one of the hardest things to do is look after Mr Orgill, who has trouble getting up the stairs and takes a cocktail of medication to deal with his health problems.

The former lorry driver was signed off sick ten years ago due to arthritis and has since developed angina and type two diabetes.

Of her husband, Ms Orgill said: 'If he was a horse he would be shot.'

Ms Bache, 40,  said it is difficult to prepare and buy enough food for seven children and said sometimes it is cheaper to give her children, like Charlie (right) takeaways to meet the cost of feeding her huge family 

Due to his disability, Mr Orgill is provided with a taxpayer-funded Vauxhall Zafira Tourer, adapted for his needs. He had to pay £200 with the rest of the cost, possibly up to £29,000, covered largely by handouts. 

He regularly plays online poker and says: 'I'm playing poker because there is nothing better to do and if I win millions I can come off benefits.'

Mr Orgill claims he wants to work but his health problems - he has arthritis in both knees and ankles, has angina and has had a quadruple heart bypass after suffering a heart attack - bar him from doing so.

He said: 'No one in their right mind would employ somebody like that.' 

Kailey Saunders is a 31-year-old single mum-of-five from Cardiff. 

She hasn’t worked for 10 years, receives more than £1,500 a month in state help and desperately wants to move into a council house with her family. She insists that single parents get too much undeserved stick. 

She has been waiting for a council house for five years. 

She said: 'I would love to have a council house so I could get my own job and provide for my children. I'm not a scrounger.'
