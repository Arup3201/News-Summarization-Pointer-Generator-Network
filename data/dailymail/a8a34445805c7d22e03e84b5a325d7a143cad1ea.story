Missing: Jesse W McMillen, 21, was last seen leaving a motel in Evansburg, Pennsylvania, on Friday morning

A Penn State student who has been missing since the weekend was hitchhiking towards Pittsburgh, it has emerged.

Jesse W McMillen, 21, was last seen leaving a motel in Evansburg, Pennsylvania, on Friday morning.

He told the front desk clerk at the Red Carpet Inn that he planned to hitchhike to Pittsburg to visit a friend.

But he never arrived and has not been seen since.

Detective Ralph Ralston told FoxNews.com: 'He said he was going to visit a friend in Pittsburgh, but he has yet to show up there.

'Weâ€™re hoping he reaches out to someone. He has not reached his destination.'

Mr
McMillen was last seen by friends at State College last week, when he 
told his roommate he was going to look at a camping trailer near 
Bellefonte he had seen advertised on Craigslist.

It is not known if he ever reached that location.

His
roommate reported him missing on Saturday and police traced him to the 
Red Carpet Inn, where he stayed on Thursday night and left early on 
Friday morning.

It is then that he said he planned to hitchhike to Pittsburgh.

McMillen has not contacted his parents, who live in Lake Ariel in Wayne County, Pennsylvania, recently.

Last known sighting: Mr McMillen stayed at the Red Carpet Inn on Thursday night and left early on Friday morning

Detective Ralston said: 'This would be unusual for him to do that. But who knows? He was a college student and he was looking for a place to live.'

He is described as 5ft 7ins tall, weighs 180 pounds, has brown hair and brown eyes, and wears glasses.

Anyone with information about his whereabouts is asked to call police on 814 234 7150.
