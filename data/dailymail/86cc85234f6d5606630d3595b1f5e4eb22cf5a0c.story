It won't be easy for the families of Newtown, Connecticut, to forget last Friday's horrific events.

But a group of cuddly Golden Retrievers are at least providing some comfort to the children and parents heartbroken after days of lingering sadness.

The loving dogs - nine in all - have travelled 900 miles from Illinois, where they were sponsored and trained by Lutheran Church Charities and they have been making their way through the close-knit town since Saturday.

'There's such a huge demand,' Dona Martin, coordinator of the charities' K-9 Comfort Dog Ministry, told The Hartford Courant.

The dogs are trained to be calm and social and have been offering comfort and solace to those shattered after 20-year-old gunman Adam Lanza stormed Sandy Hook Elementary school on Friday morning, killing 20 children and six school staff.

On Tuesday, two of the 'comfort dogs' - Ruthie and Hannah - stopped into Exel Tutoring and cuddled up to Maili Pieragostini, 6, whose little friend Charlotte Bacon, was among the children tragically shot dead in her class.

While Maili attended a different school, the two girls were good pals and often had play dates together, her mother, Katja, said.

The comfort dog ministry program began in 2008 following a shooting at Northern Illinois University.

Martin told The Courant the dogs had helped children and adults to deal with several devastating events since then.

Most recently, some of the dogs were in New York and New Jersey to comfort people affected by Hurricane Sandy, she said.

The charity sent nine of its 50 dogs to the grieving community of Newtown.

Stay in touch: Each of the nine Golden Retrievers visiting Newtown have Facebook pages so they children they meet can keep in touch

In this case, Martin said, the need was so strong that the dogs and their handlers were split into teams and sent to different areas of the mourning town.

Earlier on Tuesday, the dogs visited Newtown High School where they were introduced during a school assembly and given green and white ribbons — the colors of Newtown — to wear in memory of the victims.

But it's not just children who benefit from contact with the dogs, which each have a Facebook page for new friends who want to stay in touch.

According to Martin, people of all ages have stopped to pet the dogs as they visit the many memorials that have been created around town and as the funerals of the victims continue to take place.

'(They) are very grateful,' Barb Granado, a volunteer at Lutheran Church Charities, said of the residents who encounter the affection animals.

Fighting back her tears, Granado added: 'It's going to take a long time for the community to heal.'

The 'comfort dogs' will remain in Newtown at least until the weekend, but Martin insisted they wouldn't leave the community in the cold.

'If we are needed, we'll come back,' she said.
