Lava threatening a rural Hawaii town has stopped its slow, menacing advance — for now.

Hawaii County Civil Defense officials said Thursday the front of the lava flow has been stalled for about a week. 

However it's still about 480 feet from Pahoa Village Road, which goes through downtown.

It's possible the lava could start to be more active in the coming days. 

Officials are continuing to monitor other parts of the flow where the lava has branched out.

Residents in the Big Island's Puna district have had weeks to prepare for the slow-moving lava from Kilauea volcano.

On October 26, the flow crossed a country street on the edge of Pahoa. 

Since then, it's smothered part of a cemetery and burned down a garden shed. 

The lava also has also burned tires, some metal materials and vegetation.

On Monday President Obama declared the lava flow to be a natural disaster, Reuters reported.

The declaration frees up federal money to help protect local communities in Pahoa and the district of Puna from the lava flow, which began moving toward homes on June 27.

Pahoa residents have had weeks to prepare for what's been described as a slow-motion disaster. Most have either already left or are prepared to go.

At least 50 or 60 structures — including homes and businesses — are in an area civil defense officials are currently warning will likely be hit.

Josiah Hunt, who has farm in a part of Puna that is not immediately threatened, described smelling burning grass, feeling warmth from the lava and hearing 'popping and sizzling and all the methane bursts that are happening in the distance ... mixed with the birds chirping and the coqui frogs.'

The Lagrimas family decided to move to Kurtistown, a safe distance from Kilauea's current flow.

'We didn't want to go anywhere where it's close enough where we would have to evacuate again,' she said.

The Lagrimases are also worried the lava will block roads leading out of Pahoa and prevent them from commuting to their jobs in Hilo. Then there's the prospect of subsequent flows gradually swallowing more of the community, which is what happened to the Royal Garden and Kalapana subdivisions in the 1980s and 1990s.

'It's so surreal, it's so surreal. Never in my wildest dreams as a kid growing up did I think I would be running from lava,' said Denise Lagrimas.

Some people want to watch the lava destroy their homes as it's one way to cope with the loss.

'You can only imagine the frustration as well as ... despair they're going through,' said Hawaii County Civil Defense Director Darryl Oliveira.

Hunt watched last week as the lava crept toward Pahoa and saw a woman whose house is near its path put a lei at the front of the flow. 'It helps a person come to grips with the reality of the situation,' he said. 'I found it to be oddly comforting in a really strange way.'

Terri Mulroy, who runs Kumu Aina Farm with her husband, said the lava flow, while unnerving, has a cleansing quality to it because it keeps development on the lush Hawaiian island in check.

'If it wasn't for the flow, I wouldn't be able to live here,' she said. 'This land would have been a golf course for the rich.' 

SLOW CREEP

Scientists began warning the public about the lava on Aug. 22. At the time, residents were cleaning up from a tropical storm that made landfall over the Puna district, toppling trees and knocking out electricity.

The lava has advanced and slowed as residents waited and watched.

Kilauea volcano, one of the world's most active, has been erupting continuously since 1983.

This is not an eruption at the caldera, the things that make for stunning pictures as red lava spews from the mountaintop.

Decomposition of vegetation in the lava's path has created methane gas, which if it accumulates and is ignited by heat can cause a blast, Babb said.

'It's not a massive explosion,' she said. 'But it can dislodge rocks. It can hurl large rocks several feet.'

WHO IS AT RISK?

Initially, the lava seemed headed for the Kaohe Homesteads, a widespread, sparsely populated subdivision in the Puna district.

It reached vacant lots in the subdivision before it stalled. It skirted the northeast corner of the subdivision and then headed toward Pahoa.

Pahoa has small-town, quaint and historic charm, but it's 'the only town in a commercial sense in lower Puna,' said state Sen. Russell Ruderman, who represents Puna and runs a natural food store in Pahoa.

Because the lava could change direction, any community in Puna is at risk. Everyone in the district lives on the volcano. The lush, agricultural district is about a 30-minute drive from the coastal town of Hilo.

The lava that crossed Apaa Street is on the other end of the street from the Raras home, but they're bracing for the possibility the lava will spread or change directions.

COUNTRY-STYLE LIVING

Why would someone live on an active volcano? Unlike Honolulu, the state's biggest city on the island of Oahu, the Big Island's Puna region has affordable land and offers a more rural way of life.

Located on the island's southeast side, the area is made up of subdivisions that have unpaved roads of volcanic rock.

Many live off the grid on solar power and catchment water systems.

Residents know the risks as there are special insurance requirements to buy land in certain lava zones.

PREPARATIONS

Sporadic suspensions in the lava's movement gave emergency crews time to work on building alternate routes to town in the event the flow covers the main road and highway.

Crews near the leading edge have been wrapping power poles with concrete rings as a layer of protection from lava heat.

Officials worried that if lava crosses Highway 130, it would isolate Puna from the rest of the island.

'Puna will be divided into the north side of the flow and the south side of the flow,' Ruderman said.

Raras said they began putting their belongings in storage in September. What they aren't able to take with them, they're photographing for insurance purposes.

HOW LONG WILL THE RISK REMAIN?

No one knows if the lava flow will stop, change direction or hit homes.

In the 1990s, about 200 homes were destroyed by lava flows from Kilauea.

The last evacuations from the volcano came in 2011. One home was destroyed and others were threatened before the lava changed course.

CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE

Kilauea is home to Pele, the Hawaiian volcano goddess. Some residents expressed anger at suggestions to divert the flow. They say it's culturally insensitive to interfere with Pele's will.

YOUNG VOLCANO

The U.S. Geological Survey says Kilauea is the youngest volcano on Hawaii Island. Officials estimate Kilauea's first eruption happened between 300,000 and 600,000 years ago.

DON'T CANCEL VACATION PLANS

The lava isn't a reason to cancel a Big Island vacation because it's an isolated event.

Officials have warned people to stay away from the area and imposed flight restrictions because of helicopter tours hoping to see lava.
