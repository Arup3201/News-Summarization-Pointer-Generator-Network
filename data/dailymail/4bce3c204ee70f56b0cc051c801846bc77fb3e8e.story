A Missouri man has broken a state record after catching a whopping 140lb paddlefish.  

Andy Belobraydic III snared the behemoth, measuring 56 ¾ inches long and 43 ¾ inches wide, at Table Rock Lake in The Ozarks on Saturday.

The previous best was 139lb hooked in at the same location in 2002.

It was the first time the 33-year-old had been out hunting the game fish after his friends urged him to go.

Two days after reeling in the monster, he told the Sedalia News Journal: 'I’m still sore this morning. 

'I told my buddies to take a picture of it in the water,' he added 'because I knew if I couldn’t get it in the boat, no one was ever going to believe this.

When he managed to bring the fish in, one of his friends kept repeating the famous line from Jaws: 'You're going to need a bigger boat.' 

Belobraydic revealed he had already had a successful outing, snagging two paddlefish earlier in the day.

However the third toppled the record. It took him 30 minutes of work to get the creature onto the boat.

It was then taken to the Missouri Department of Conservation’s (MDC) Shepherd of the Hills Fish Hatchery near Branson, Missouri, 

After weighing and measuring the fish, the record was ratified on Monday.
