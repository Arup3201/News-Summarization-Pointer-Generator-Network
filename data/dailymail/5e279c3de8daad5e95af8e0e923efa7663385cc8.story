A man has died after being bitten several times by a deadly snake in Western Australia's Goldfields region.

A police spokesperson said the 41-year-old Aboriginal man was trying to help another man dispose of the western brown snake in a park on Laverton's main street on Wednesday last week.

The two men were trying to remove the threat that the deadly snake posed to people in the surrounding communities.

Deadly: The western brown snake is a highly venomous ground dwelling snake native to Australia

When he tried to pick up the snake, the man was bitten two to three times on the hand and lower arm.

'We believe he was trying to do the right thing,' the Police spokesperson told AAP.

'(But) he handled it when he shouldn't have.'

The man did not seek any medical attention, instead going to nearby camp site, where he collapsed.

An ambulance was called and paramedics applied first aid, then rushed him to Laverton hospital, but he died shortly after arrival.

The man came from the community of Blackstone near Warburton.

The spokesman said it was suspected the snake was a highly venomous western brown.

The snake was captured and killed, before being brought to Perth for testing by the Department of Parks and Wildlife, which will  provide a report to police for their use in a report for the coroner.

Two children, aged three and six, were also bitten by snakes in the Wheatbelt town of Moora this week but were discharged from hospital.
