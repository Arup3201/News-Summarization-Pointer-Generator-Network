Liverpool have confirmed that defender Tiago Ilori has joined Bordeaux on loan.

The 21-year-old joined Brendan Rodgers' side last summer after completing an £8million move from Portuguese club Sporting SP.

However, with Liverpool well stocked for defenders, the youngster will spend a season-long loan with the Ligue 1 side - after spending a successful spell in the second half of last season with Spanish side Granada.

Surplus to requirements: Tiago Ilori hasn't made a senior appearance for Liverpool since signing last summer

Out on loan: Brendan Rodgers wants to send the former Sporting Lisbon defender (centre) on loan this season

Rodgers has managed to convince the 
Portuguese U20 international, who is yet to feature for the Reds' first XI, that it is in his best interests to go out 
on loan and get some football.

Bordeaux are the first club to show interest in Llori whose way in to the Liverpool first team is barred by the likes of Mamadou Sakho, Martin Skrtel and new signing from Southampton Dejan Lovren.

Meanwhile, another Liverpool defender Kolo Toure has turned down a proposed move to Trabsonspor in Turkey.

New arrival: Centre-back Dejan Lovren has arrived at Anfield for £20m  from Southampton this summer 

Staying put: Kolo Toure has refused a move to Turkish club Trabsonspor to fight for a place at Liverpool
