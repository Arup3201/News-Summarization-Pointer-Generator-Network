The 36-year-old's side are currently eight in the table after two wins and two losses, and Gattuso was unhappy with the level of criticism he was receiving.

He said: 'OFI is not Real Madrid, is not Barcelona. It's a small team with many problems. I want my players to play with balls, with heart.'

'I no like the excuse that maybe the players don't play with heart because (the club) no pay salary. F*** off - this no true. 

'Yes the club has problems, I know. I do not cry because I no have money.' 

Gattuso also criticised a journalist who had been continuously writing that he would leave the club.

'Leave what? It's too easy for me to leave. No, me stay here. It is my family here. I did not come here for a holiday.'
