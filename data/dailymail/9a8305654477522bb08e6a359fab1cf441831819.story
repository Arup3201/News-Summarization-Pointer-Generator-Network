EXTREME by Emma Barrett & Paul Martin (Oxford, £16.99)

What kind of people are drawn to spend time in extreme environments? Not you or I, obviously. We’ll read about such places, but we don’t want to go there.

But who are the men and women who climb the highest mountains, explore the poles, dive to the bottom of oceans and spend months on space stations? Not to put too fine a point on it, are they all halfway round the bend?

This isn’t actually a frivolous question, and psychologists Emma Barrett and Paul Martin have seriously attempted to answer it in this rich and often compelling book.

Lionel Greenstreet (left) with his beard frozen during the Shackleton expedition and Apsley Cherry-Garrard (right) who was a member of Captain Scott’s Antarctic back-up team, and described polar exploration as ‘the cleanest and most isolated way of having a bad time which has been devised’

Test pilots, round-the-world yachtsmen and deep-cave explorers are not like the rest of us: they cannot be. So what psychological and emotional qualities does a person need to survive, even thrive, in such circumstances?

Some cannot prepare enough. Apsley Cherry-Garrard was a member of Captain Scott’s Antarctic back-up team, and described polar exploration as ‘the cleanest and most isolated way of having a bad time which has been devised’.

The winter before Scott walked to the South Pole — and his death — Cherry-Garrard and two companions were sent off into the Antarctic wilderness to collect Emperor penguin eggs. It was pitch dark, temperatures hit minus 60c and each man needed rescuing after falling into deep crevasses.

The cold was so intense that their teeth started to split. They even became frostbitten in their sleeping bags.

Five weeks later, they returned with three penguin eggs, but a decade later, Cherry-Garrard said that the expedition ‘had beggared the language: no words could express its horror’.

Tom Wolfe said people with endurance had 'the right stuff'

You may have what Tom Wolfe called ‘the right stuff’. In 1952, a test pilot called Bill Waterton took off in a jet aircraft minutes after seeing a fellow pilot die in a horrific crash. ‘Waterton, who still had burn marks from a crash he had survived nine days earlier, was forced to taxi along one edge of the runway to avoid the smouldering wreckage of his friend’s plane. The ability to overcome fear and manage anxiety is a prerequisite for coping with extremes.’

A chapter on loneliness is followed by a chapter on the difficulty of dealing with other people. Even this isn’t as simple as it sounds. The traveller Wilfred Thesiger was never lonely while walking barefoot across the Arabian deserts, perennially thirsty, baking through the day, freezing at night. But put him down in a European city where he knew no one and he was miserable.

‘The worst loneliness,’ he wrote, ‘is to be lonely in a crowd.’

Anxiety, meanwhile, afflicts even the best of them. Brendan Hall, skipper of the yacht that won the gruelling Clipper Round The World race in 2009-10, attributed his success, in part, to meticulous planning. ‘But thinking about all the potential dangers gave him sleepless nights before the start of every leg of the race.’

Some experience such anxiety in real life they turn to extreme activities as a way of managing it. Here’s Vera van Schaik, a cave diver known for chasing depth records: ‘My personal life was this world of confusion, stress and fear in which I struggled on a daily basis to cope. Diving was a place of peace and calm in which I excelled.’

Many people go looking for excitement and find, instead, monotony. Eugene Cernan, who went to the Moon with Apollo 17, later wrote: ‘Funny thing happened on the way to the Moon: not much. Should have brought some crossword puzzles.’

So when Nasa built the Skylab space station in the early Seventies, it brought in the industrial designer Raymond Loewy for advice on habitability. Many of his suggestions are now standard in confined environments: moveable furniture, varied colour schemes, plants for you to water.

For Skylab, his most controversial suggestion was a window for the astronauts to look out of. Nasa resisted. It seemed frivolous. But for the mental health of the astronauts, it turned out to be essential. As one said, ‘all the conditions necessary for murder are met if you shut two men in a cabin measuring 18ft by 20ft and leave them together for two months’.

People do indeed fall out. In 1959, a Soviet scientist killed another scientist with an ice pick after an argument over a game of chess. The USSR’s response was to ban chess at its Antarctic stations.

And what of the loved ones all these maniacs leave behind? The climber Robert Macfarlane argued that mountaineers who keep on taking big risks are ‘either profoundly selfish, or incapable of sympathy for those who love them’.

One climber’s wife even admitted to feeling an instant of relief when she heard her husband had died, because at least she wouldn’t have worry about him dying any longer.

It will probably be no surprise that there isn’t one sort of person who is drawn to these exploits, or one sort of person who excels at them.

As in real life, it takes all sorts.

There’s only one kind of individual you really want to avoid. As the guitar-playing astronaut Chris Hadfield put it: ‘No one wants to go into space with a jerk.’
