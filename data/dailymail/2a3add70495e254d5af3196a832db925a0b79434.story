Have you recently been stung for an in-app purchase you either didn't want, or your child accidentally bought? You could be in luck.

Apple has sent an email to customers offering them a refund for certain purchases made via installed apps from its App Store.

The message was sent to all iTunes users in the U.S. who have recently made an in-app purchase - which is a paid-for extra available within an app or game.

In January, Apple was ordered to pay at least $32.5million (£19.6million) to settle a case over in-app purchases.

The
 firm was also told by the Federal Trade Commission to overhaul its
 charging system to make it more obvious when payments are being taken.

The settlement involves all apps in which minors made unauthorised purchases, and only applies to customers in the U.S.

It
 addresses the same issue raised in a class-action lawsuit that Apple 
resolved last year.

Apple agreed to contact its app customers to offer them $5 (£3) store credit, or a $30 (£18) cash refund 
if their children had spent at least that much money without parental 
consent.

That
 settlement resulted in 37,000 claims.

These include upgrades to cars, for example, in driving games, or new lives in Candy Crush.

The email comes after a string of cases where children have been able to run up large bills on in-app purchases when playing games on their parents' devices.

‘Apple is committed to providing parents and kids with a great experience on the App Store,’ said the email.

‘We've heard from some customers that it was too easy for their kids to make in-app purchases.

‘As a result, we've improved controls for parents so they can better manage their children's purchases, or restrict them entirely.’

One incident of in-app overspending in the U.S. resulted in a lawsuit from parents, while a UK police officer reported his son for fraud after he spent more than £3,000 playing games including Plants vs. Zombies using his father's login details.

A setting in the iOS software keeps passwords on the App Store active for 15 minutes. This means apps won’t ask for the password to be entered again within that time, and certain purchases and downloads can be made without re-entering the code. However, Apple does offer tighter restrictions in the Settings menu, pictured

The settlement involves all apps in which minors made unauthorised purchases and only applies to U.S. customers.

It
 addresses the same issue raised in a class-action lawsuit that Apple 
resolved last year.

In that case, Apple agreed to contact 28 million of 
its app customers to offer them $5 (£3) store credit or a $30 (£18) cash refund 
if their children had spent at least that much money without parental 
consent. That
 settlement resulted in 37,000 claims.

In the past, Apple introduced an ‘in-app purchase’ label to items on the App Store that contain buyable extras, as well as an information page on iTunes about how to improve password security on devices to prevent unexpected expense.

The problem lies in how Apple handles passwords. A setting in the iOS software keeps passwords on the App Store active for 15 minutes.

This means apps won’t ask for the password to be entered again within that time, and certain purchases and downloads can be made without re-entering the code.

In January, Apple and CEO Tim Cook, pictured, was ordered to pay at least $32.5million (£19.6million) to settle a case over in-app purchases. The firm was also told by the Federal Trade Commission to overhaul its charging system to make it more obvious when payments are being taken

However, Apple does offer tighter restrictions for parents, for example, that require a password to be entered every time a download is made, or a purchase is instigated.

These restrictions can be enabled in the Settings menu.

While refunds have been offered in individual cases in the past, this is the first time the company, based in California, has asked customers to come forward and make requests for reimbursement.

The email concludes by offering steps on how to submit a refund request, with all submissions needed before 15 April next year.
