FIFA 15 will see Lionel Messi, Eden Hazard and Neymar look even more like their real-life counterparts than ever before.

No stone has been left unturned in EA Sports’ quest to make the game as authentic and realistic as possible as their new trailer shows.

Aside from the players looking frighteningly like the real thing, there are new features such as visual breathing and hair movements. 

Better: FIFA 15 looks set to become the most realistic in the game's history when it's released

Spot the difference! Eden Hazard looks almost identical on the game (left) as he does when playing for Chelsea

Wind through: Paris Saint-Germain's Edinson Cavani''s hair will wave as the weather dictates in-play

The 
attention to detail involved in the development of this year’s edition 
looks set to make it the most accurate simulation of the beautiful game 
yet.

Boots and slide tackles will leave marks on the ground and the playing surface will tear up as the game progresses.

The
 focus this year appears to be on lots of subtle amendments to enhance 
the overall gaming experience; the corner flags will move if hit for the
 first time and crossbars will rattle on impact.

The kits will become visibly dirty with mud and grass throughout the game and move realistically.

In terms of overall feel EA sports claim new character models and body rigging will make players more powerful and athletic.

Whether that promise comes to fruition remains to be seen but you have to admit the new visuals look very, very impressive.

Attention to detail: Lionel Messi's face recognition looks as similar as possible to the real thing for Barcelona

The Yellow Wall: Borussia Dortmund's Westfalenstadion looks resplendent on the footage released early
