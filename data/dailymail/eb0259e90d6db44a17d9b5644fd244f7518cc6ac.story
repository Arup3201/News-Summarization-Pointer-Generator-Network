Tottenham face at least two years playing in Milton Keynes as they build their new stadium, the Mail on Sunday can reveal.

The news will dismay Spurs fans, who must trek 50 miles to the land of concrete cows not just for a single campaign but for two seasons — maybe more. 

The nightmare scenario has been forced on Spurs because their stadium design won’t allow for the project to be built in phases.

Club officials recently admitted they would have to move out for a season when they receive the go-ahead to start building.

However, the prospect of long-term displacement raises concerns Spurs could be forced to play in front of low crowds for a damaging period.

Stadium:mk holds a little over 30,000 supporters.

Spurs hope to receive the green light in January when a High Court hearing will look into a major challenge to their plans.

Spurs fans will have to commute 48.3 miles from White Hart Lane for home games

Work on the new stadium has been held back by a local business that has refused to move to make way for the development and has used its right to appeal against a CPO decision in July that went in favour of the club.

Spurs recently confirmed delays meant they would not have a home stadium for the 2017-18 season, and would have to play home matches somewhere else.

However, as well as the prospect of additional time away from White Hart Lane, there is growing acceptance from officials that the stadium project may not be ready to open until 2020-21.
