Tapped out: Rep Devin Nunes said during a radio interview on Wednesday night that the Justice Department has monitored calls out of the Congressional cloak room

The Justice Department's use of wiretapping has apparently not stopped with journalists, as one lawmaker has accused the agency of keeping tabs of elected officials where they relax.

Republican Representative Devin Nunes of California claimed during a radio interview last night that the agency has monitored calls out of the U.S. Congress Republican cloak room - a hangout for members of party on Capitol Hill.

As the interview turned to the Associated Press phone 
records scandal, Representative Nunes said the Justice Department's actions go
beyond reporters to politicians.

Representative Nunes told host Hugh Hewitt: 'I don’t think people are focusing on the 
right thing when they talk about going after the AP reporters. The big 
problem that I see is that they actually tapped right where I’m sitting 
right now, the cloak room.'

The room is not just a place for lawmakers to hang their coats; it's an area at the Capitol where members of both parties have conversations, sleep, or have a meal without leaving the building.

It's also an area where many senators and members of Congress speak to reporters.

Representatives Nunes said that the scandal makes a 'separation of powers issue.'

He told Hewitt: 'So when they went after the AP reporters, right? Went after all of their phone records, they went after the phone records, including right up here in the House Gallery, right up from where I’m sitting right now. So you have a real separation of powers issue that did this really rise to the level that you would have to get phone records that would... most likely include members of Congress.'

The startling revelation comes as a growing number of journalists and politicians have called for the resignation of U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder over the Justice Department's largely unprecedented acquisition of hundreds of reporters' call logs. 

Republican National Chairman Reince Priebus was one of the first people to call for Holder to quit, along with former Current TV hosts Keith Olbermann and David Shuster.

'The First Amendment doesn't request the federal government to respect it; it demands it,' Priebus said. 'Attorney General Eric Holder, in permitting the Justice Department to issue secret subpoenas to spy on Associated Press reporters, has trampled on the First Amendment and failed in his sworn duty to uphold the Constitution.'

Olbermann called for Holder to resign 
via Twitter, saying, 'If Mr Holder continues to support this rogue 
action, he should resign.'

Shuster, on the other hand, said Holder should be fired. 

'The DOJ's collection of AP phone records is outrageous and sickening,' Shuster tweeted. 'Mr. President, you must fire AG Holder.'

Esquire magazine's Charles P. Pierce and Newsweek/Daily Beast correspondent Michael Tomasky concurred.

'He should be gone. This moment,' Pierce wrote on the website of the men's magazine. 'Not only is this constitutionally abhorrent, it is politically moronic.'

Claims: Holder claims he recused himself from the investigation in which the justice department obtained two months' worth of call logs from roughly 100 Associated Press editors and reporters

In a post titled, 'Obama should ask holder to resign,' Tomasky said he doesn't expect the president to actually give the attorney general a pink slip.

'He’s going to stand by Eric Holder for now and let some interminable process play out,' Tomasky predicted.

But, he argued, 'he ought to ask for Holder’s resignation. This week. Enough already. Holder's rights here aren't more important than Obama sending a strong signal that he is in charge and can make hard decisions.'

'This isn’t a time for letting processes play out,' Tomasky added. 'This is a time to take action.'

Holder claims he recused himself from the investigation in which the justice department obtained two months' worth of call logs from roughly 100 Associated Press editors and reporters.

The records list outgoing calls for the work and personal phone numbers of individual reporters as well as general AP office numbers in several bureaus.
