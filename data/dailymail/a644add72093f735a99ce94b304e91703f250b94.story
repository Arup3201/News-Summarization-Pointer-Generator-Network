Disgraced former Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne compared himself to 3rd Century Christian martyr Saint Sebastian in an interview the night before he was jailed for passing his speeding points to his wife, it has emerged.

‘It’s been a very long process,’ said Huhne. ‘My QC said his vision of me was Saint Sebastian having all these arrows coming in from all directions, which is sometimes what it’s felt like over the last few months.’

His interviewer, the transvestite potter Grayson Perry, replied: ‘But Saint Sebastian didn’t bring it on himself.’

Huhne replied: ‘We don’t know that. He might have.’

Sebastian was sentenced to death by being tied to a stake and facing a ‘firing squad’ of archers by Emperor Diocletian because of his Christian faith. He survived and was rescued, only to be clubbed to death later.

Huhne’s astonishing comments came in a new documentary Grayson Perry: Who Are You? to be shown this month.

Perry observed that 60-year-old Huhne’s conviction for perverting the course of justice, for which he was jailed for eight months, hadn’t changed him at all.

Huhne’s ‘Teflon confidence’ was evident last week when he complained to The Mail on Sunday about our report.

Mr Huhne even drafted his own apology for publication.

The former Energy Secretary – now a columnist for the Guardian – lied to the public, then the police and courts, for nearly two years about having illegally passed speeding points to his wife Vicky Pryce.

His lawyers claimed a ‘wicked coven’ plotted to bring him down.

In his letter, Mr Huhne disputed our account of when we discovered that former judge Constance Briscoe had lied to the police about her contact with this newspaper, and when Assistant Editor David Dillon first realised his mobile and landline records had been obtained by Kent Police using RIPA.

We stand by our report.
