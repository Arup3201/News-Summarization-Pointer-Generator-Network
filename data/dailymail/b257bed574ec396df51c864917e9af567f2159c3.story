Footballer Mario Balotelli walked away unhurt from a car crash in his Bentley - just hours after his girlfriend discovered he had a fling with the same prostitute as Wayne Rooney.

Model Raffaella Fico is said to be devastated by the betrayal, with a friend adding that she is ‘not in a good way’ and ‘in pieces’ over the revelations.

The Manchester City star, 21, is said to have met former escort Jennifer Thompson - who had advertised herself as a £1,200-a-night call girl under the name 'Juicy Jeni' - five times and had sex with her twice behind Miss Fico’s back.

A friend in her hometown of Cercola, near Naples, said: ‘To say that she is devastated must be the understatement of the year.

‘She can brush off his trips to strip clubs but sleeping with a hooker is in a whole new league.

‘She’s been made to look a fool,’ according to the Mirror.

Balotelli's club Manchester City 
confirmed the 21-year-old was involved in a prang with another vehicle 
close to Deansgate Locks in Manchester City Centre.

City stated said that Baltoelli was not at fault and was unharmed along with the driver of the other car.

According to some reports, Balotelli 
was driving a white car and was said to be 'shook up' but was unhurt and
apparently joked with onlookers.

City are growing increasingly concerned over Balotelli's antics.

Earlier
on Thursday he revealed that a weight has been lifted from his 
shoulders following revelations that he had a fling with a prostitute 
linked to Wayne Rooney.

Balotelli admitted that his knowledge of the story had been a heavy burden. 

Balotelli's agent, Mino Raiola, 
pre-empted embarrassing headlines by revealing details of a 'brief 
involvement' with Jennifer Thompson, who claimed in 2010 that Rooney had
paid her £1,200-a-night for sex while his wife Coleen was five months 
pregnant.

'Raffaella ti amo': Balotelli sported this 
T-shirt declaring his love for Miss Fico during a match against Blackburn Rovers in February - just two days after it is 
claimed he slept with Miss Thompson

In an interview with Gazzetta dello Sport,
he added: 'I know I must still learn to keep my private life separate 
from my profession. It's not easy, but I have taken this step to free me
from the weight of this story.

'Recently, I admit, I have been troubled - because of this story, but 
not only. My natural parents in some interviews have been disrespectful 
to my family.

'Now that this weight has been lifted, I am certain that I will find the positive energy to make the best run for the title with Manchester City, and prepare in the best way for the European Championship.
