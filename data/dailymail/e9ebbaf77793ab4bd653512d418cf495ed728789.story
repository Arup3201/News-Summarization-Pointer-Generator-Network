A man who was so fat he had to use a seat belt designed for pregnant women on an aeroplane has lost 17 stone.

David Hudson, 43, steadily crept up to 34 stone after years of late night fast food, pies, pasties and binge drinking.

He was so overweight he had already been approved for gastric band surgery.

Success: David Hudson, 43, lost 17st after the humilation of needing a pregnant woman's seat belt on a flight

But after the mortifying incident on a flight to Turkey in 2010 - and bumping into an old friend who had just lost weight - he decided to try and shed the pounds himself.

He has now reached his target weight of 17 stone and at 6ft 8ins, his GP has deemed him fit and healthy for a man of his age.

Mr Hudson, a CCTV engineer who lives in Wallsend, North Tyneside, said: 'I bumped into a friend in a supermarket who had lost a lot of weight and I thought if he can do it - so can I.'

His work shift patterns, and his wife Alison’s late nights managing a pub, meant that the couple often didn't eat until midnight or 1am.

He said: 'I was just eating daft rubbish and slowly the weight crept on. On a flight to Turkey the stewardess gave me a seatbelt for a pregnant woman and I got wedged in the seat so there was no leg room for the guy behind me.

Transformed: Mr Hudson and his wife Alison. Because of their shift patterns, they piled on the pounds eating late at night. They now eat healthier meals

'That was the worst. You are aware of looks and you are aware that even though people politely say nothing, you can see them looking at you out the corner of your eye.'

In his 20s, Mr Hudon had been a keen runner - but over the years had piled on the pounds.

'I was a runner and people used called me Rodney Trotter I was so lanky, but by my late 20s I was starting to put on weight.'

By  the time he started dieting in 2010, he was 34 stone.

After losing five stone by himself, over seven months, he felt he had hit a brick wall.

Determined to keep going, last year he signed up to a Slimming World class, regularly losing half a stone a week.  Over eight months, he lost 10 stone.

Joint effort: Mr Hudson's success also inspired his wife Alison to join the group  - she has lost 2st

He also learned how to cook meals from scratch, was given healthy recipes to try and has become a regular at the gym - going up to 12 times a week.

Mr Hudson said: 'The first time I did three minutes 
on the treadmill I thought I was going to die. But I went back the next 
day and did 10 minutes and now I can do an hour’s cardio session.

Over 36 weeks he lost more than 10 stone and now weighs 17st 10lb. His Slimming World leader has declared it is the highest weight loss she has ever seen.

Mr Hudson's success also inspired his wife Alison to join the group. She has now lost two stone, going from 11 st 8lb to 9st 4lb.

He said: 'The Slimming World sessions were just the focus I needed each week to keep the number on the scales going down.'
