Paul McGinley insists he is yet to decide who he will be recommending to be Europe's 2016 Ryder Cup captain but says a new man will be appointed in the next two months.

McGinley inspired Europe to a 16.5-11.5 victory over the United States in September and is now tasked with choosing a successor to lead the team in Minnesota next year.

The selection panel will include former captains Jose Maria Olazabal and Colin Montgomerie, as well European Tour officials, but McGinley's opinion is likely to carry particular weight after his triumph at Gleneagles.

He said: 'I haven't fully made my mind up yet about who I'm going to recommend.

'We're still communicating, there are a number of people involved in making that decision - current players, potential players going forward, and people who are associated with the Ryder Cup.

'I'm gathering information from everyone and I want to get a really solid view of what everybody thinks before I bring my ideas forward.

'We're working on it and in the next couple of months we'll have a new captain in place and the wheels will be turning towards another Ryder Cup.'

Darren Clarke is the strong favourite to take the post having played in the Ryder Cup five times and helped lead the team as vice-captain in 2010.

McGinley's relationship with Clarke, however, remains strained after Clarke withdrew his support for McGinley's bid to lead the side in 2014 and suggested he may not have the presence to face America captain Tom Watson.

'Would Clarke be a good captain? The one thing I cannot do is express an opinion on that,' McGinley said.

'I'll talk about it afterwards but at this moment it's only right I stay neutral and am fair to all the candidates.

'When I was trying to be captain, all I wanted was to be treated fairly by everybody so I think it's important I do the same now I'm involved in the decision making process.'

McGinley drew on a wide variety of experience to help him lead at Gleneagles and he says he would be happy to offer his advice to future teams, but only if it was called upon.

'Of course I would be happy to help going forward,' McGinley said.

'I'm European through and through and have been involved in six Ryder Cups and have a lot of experience.

'Whoever is Ryder Cup captain though, it's important he captains how he sees fit and doesn't try to copy me or anybody else before.

'It's important the captain is true to himself and captains the way he thinks is best to get a result for Europe.

'But if anybody wants to have a conversation with me, I certainly would be very happy to do so.'

In contrast to McGinley, Watson's leadership style was one of many factors blamed for America's loss last year and a Ryder Cup Task Force has since been established to unearth a way of beating the Europeans.

McGinley, however, believes there is one explanation that may have been overlooked.

'For all the fall-out over there, there's never been a whole lot of recognition of what a formidable opponent Europe has become,' McGinley said.

'The European Tour is producing great players and then there are the experienced players who make the team time after time.

'We have the world number one player saying he was more up for the Ryder Cup singles than he was for the last round of two majors last year.

'That just shows how important it's become for Europeans.

'Our players are dominating the top of the world rankings and we were playing at home. We were a very, very tough opponent.'
