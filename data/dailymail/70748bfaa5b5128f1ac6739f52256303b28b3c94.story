A new hotel in Berlin is giving passers-by more than they bargained for – by using floor-to-ceiling glass in its toilets.

The design fault at the restaurant of the 25hours Hotel Bikini Berlin means those walking past the building can see diners going about their business.

The trendy hotel is only 10 storeys tall, meaning that anyone walking on the street below will get a rather detailed eyeful if they glance up.

After pedestrians snapped guests using the toilets, the hotel felt it should warn those staying there, putting up signs which read: ‘Please be careful, not only the monkeys are watching.’

On its website, the hotel says it is 'open for monkey business'.

It adds: 'The hotel showcases cosmopolitan Berlin at its location in the listed Bikini-Haus building between the Berlin Zoo and Breitscheidplatz designer Werner Aisslinger and his team created a hotel world playing with the contrasts of nature and culture.

'The hotel is popular not only among its own guests, thanks to the restaurant and bar on the top floor with a 360° rooftop terrace and first-class views of the city and the Berlin Zoo.'

It also adds that its mission statement is: 'We offer our guests a contemporary hotel experience in individual, design oriented boutique hotels. Our services stand out through the highest degree of cordiality and professionalism.

'We are continually expanding the portfolio of 25hours hotels and will develop to a brand associated with individuality, authenticity, zeitgeist and nonchalance.'
