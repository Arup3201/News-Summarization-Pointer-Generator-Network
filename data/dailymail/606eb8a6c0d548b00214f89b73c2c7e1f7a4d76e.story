Prince William has honoured efforts to save African wildlife from extinction at a star-studded awards ceremony.

The Duke of Cambridge mingled with guests including newlywed opera singer Katherine Jenkins, entrepreneur Deborah Meaden and BBC journalist Kate Silverton at the elite bash last night at London's Claridge's Hotel.

He handed the top prize to a Madagascan conservationist, who the ceremony heard has helped islanders get personally involved in conserving almost 900,000 acres of land.

Mingling: The Duke led the show at the Tusk Conservation Awards in London's Claridge's Hotel last night

Last year the Tusk Trust raised £1.65million in donations with the help of Prince William, who is its royal patron, and high society sponsors including Investec Asset Management, Moët & Chandon and Tiffany & Co

Celebrities: Newlywed Katherine Jenkins and her husband Andrew Levitas were among high-profile guests

It was the second year of the ceremony held by the Tusk Trust, a conservation charity founded by former insurance broker Charlie Mayhew in 1990 which has a string of high-profile backers.

Last year it raised £1.65million in donations with the help of Prince William, who is its royal patron, and high society sponsors including Investec Asset Management, Moët & Chandon and Tiffany & Co.

The Duke appeared on his own as the Duchess of Cambridge was helping launch a £10million fundraising drive by East Anglia's Children's Hospices (EACH), of which she is royal patron.

But he had no shortage of company at the Mayfair hotel, from the impressionist Rory Bremner to the singer Camilla Kerslake.

He presented the Tusk Conservation Award to Herizo Andrianandrasana of Madagascar, who the ceremony heard has helped locals on the island get involved in vast conservation projects.

Royal seal of approval: Kenyan Richard Bonham received a lifetime achievement award in the Duke's name

Mr Andrianandrasana has spent 16 years working for the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, which was founded by English naturalist, author and TV presenter Gerald Durrell.

The citation called him the 'driving force behind the integration of local people into conservation management and monitoring in Madagascar', adding he has led programmes across four forests and three wetland sites with an area of almost 900,000 acres.

Also honoured was Kenyan safari leader Richard Bonham, who picked up an award named for the Duke.

Prince William, who announced plans to introduce a third award for wildlife rangers, told the gathered celebrities: 'The work of this year's finalists serves to illustrate some of our greatest conservation challenges: dramatic loss of lion; poaching of elephant and rhino; deforestation; and the critical need for community involvement.

'Wildlife rangers are the men and women at the frontline of the battle – and it is a battle – to save some of the world's most iconic species.

Guests: Dragons' Den entrepreneur Deborah Meaden and opera singer Katherine Jenkins were at the bash

Behind the cause: Comedian Rory Bremner was among the high-profile guests showing their support

'These people cannot face the bullets and the threats alone. It is up to governments and intra-national bodies to unite behind them, and to play a meaningful part in ensuring that their efforts on the ground are fruitful.' 

The awards were hosted by Kate Silverton, who also oversaw the inaugural event last year. 

The Duke is a long-term supporter of the Tusk Trust and became its royal patron in 2005.

The work follows in the footsteps of his late mother Princess Diana, who he credited last year with inspiring him to help Africa's environment.

'She would come back with all these stories and full of excitement and just passion for what she had been doing,' he told CNN.

'And I sort of used to sit there, quite a sort of surprised little boy at the time, taking it all in.' 

Stars: Among the guests was classical crossover singer Camilla Kerslake, who Gary Barlow helped to fame

Host: After presenting the inaugural awards last year, Kate Silverton did the honours for a second time 

Passionate supporter: Prince William is a patron of the trust and showed his support on the night
