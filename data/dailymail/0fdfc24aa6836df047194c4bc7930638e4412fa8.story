Facebook announced yesterday that adverts will appear on the 425m mobile devices used to access the social network.

The move follows the roll-out of adverts on users' news feeds, which began in early January. This means that brands you’ve endorsed by hitting the ‘like’ button will now be able to push deals and other updates right into the news feeds that show your friends' updates, photos and links.

The changes come ahead of Facebook's 
initial public offering of stock, expected this spring. The IPO could 
value the company at as much as $100 billion (£62billion). That means Facebook has to prove it can bring in real advertising revenue from massive brands.

‘Facebook is making serious money from ads right now, but they are not making serious money from major brand advertisers. That's where the ad money is,’ said Rebecca Lieb, an analyst with the Altimeter Group. ‘They currently have rather low-rent, shoddy ads on Facebook.’

That could change as Facebook starts integrating brands' messages into the news feeds of its 845 million users as part of a long-term vision of moving from ads to stories about brands.

However industry analysts have reservations about the move.

Ken Wisnefski, a social-media expert 
and Web entrepreneur, warned the social network could end up ‘irritating
their user base by inundating them with ads’.

BBC 5 Live's internet expert Olly Mann, meanwhile, told MailOnline: 'Mobile
is the fastest growing area for Facebook, along with gaming, so it's 
not at all surprising they're introducing mobile ads. Now's the time to 
experiment, before it becomes a fully public company. It just has to be 
careful.'

He added that the timing of the announcement couldn't be better for the social network giant.

'While
Mobile World Congress is distracting the relevant consumer technology 
journalists, Google's privacy is under the spotlight and Apple are 
combatting the controversy around their app policy relating to mobile 
Contacts - they've made a play to advertisers whilst trying to keep this
under wraps to their users,' he said.

Dave Bird, Managing Director at Derby-based Webtistic, a company that provides internet marketing services, said: 'I can understand that Facebook is doing what it can to stay profitable in the highly competitive social media space, especially with the IPO just around the corner. There is an atmosphere of uncertainty around Facebook’s revenue model and this will go some way to satisfy potential investors.

'The downside of course is that Facebook users may see this as being "spammy" and negatively impact on Facebook’s biggest asset – user experience. Risking the "stickiness" of the site could be a dangerous game, especially with the likes of Google Plus and Pinterest challenging for market share.'

Facebook made the announcement at the American Museum of Natural History in New York in a rare East Coast appearance for a Silicon Valley company.

Rather than bombarding people with flashy ads, Facebook is urging companies to integrate themselves into what people are already doing on the site - talking to their friends and family, commenting on photos or posting news links.

‘The definition of the word “advertise” is to draw attention to,’ said Chris Cox, Facebook's vice president of product. ‘The definition of a story is narration, which you'd think is what people prefer.’

Facebook has a vast trove of information about its users' lives, hobbies, likes and dislikes, yet the company has kept advertising fairly unobtrusive to date. Ads for teeth-whitening, wineries and laundry detergent and the like are relegated to the right side of users' Facebook pages. Over time, Web-savvy users have grown used to ads and many are tuning them out.

Those ads are not going away, but brands will now be able to push updates - or as Facebook likes to call, ‘stories’ - right into the news feeds.

Facebook's challenge will be to keep these ads as unobtrusive as possible so that users are not alienated or driven to ‘unlike’ brands.

‘I think they understand that people value authenticity,’ said Clara Shih, CEO of Hearsay Social, a marketing software company for businesses. ‘The new page format and the new ad format encourage authenticity and storytelling.’

Companies can continue to set up Facebook pages on their brands for free. They'd pay to insert updates into news feeds and elsewhere based on the number of fans they have. In other words, posting the message will remain free, but getting more people to see it will cost money.

Facebook will collect feedback and test how users respond as it rolls out the changes gradually. At first, users may see just one message a day from a brand inside their news feed, or even less. And they won't see messages from random companies they are not connected to in some way - directly or through a friend.

‘Facebook has certainly backed down on things,’ Lieb said. ‘But they are not just going on what people say. They are going on what they do.’

Beyond the updates within news feeds, Facebook will also start showing ads when people log out of the site.
