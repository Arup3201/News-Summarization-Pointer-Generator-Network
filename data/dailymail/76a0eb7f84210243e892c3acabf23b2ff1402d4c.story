George Best is still the bravest player I've seen... he changed football

Duncan Edwards was my idol in the fifties... I was devastated after the Munich air disaster

For 50 years, Harry Redknapp has been one of football’s most colourful and outspoken characters.

Now he’s written a book every fan will want to read.

In Redknapp’s new book 'A Man Walks On To a Pitch' - serialised exclusively by Sportsmail this week - the QPR manager picks his all-time team of the fifties.

BILLY WRIGHT

If you look at what he achieved, it seems impossible. He played 70 consecutive games for England, captained them 90 times and won 105 caps — the first player to reach the century in world football, even though he lost seven years of his career to the Second World War.

DUNCAN EDWARDS

Bobby Charlton said watching Duncan made him feel inadequate. He had it all: left foot, right foot, phenomenal balance and poise; he could dribble, he could tackle; there was 14 stone of him, strong as an ox. He made his England debut at 18. They beat Scotland 7-2.

DANNY BLANCHFLOWER

I don’t think British football has ever produced a better thinker. He invented the wall. You know, the wall that every team in the world now puts in front of a free-kick taker? Danny thought of it first, in a game against Italy. Danny told me that the Italians seemed so perplexed — and so was the ref — that when defender Sergio Cervato picked up the ball, moved it five yards wide of the wall, turned round and shot it into the net, a goal was awarded!

TOM FINNEY

I’ll lean on my old man here. Dad was Finney-mad. Bill Shankly said he would have been great even playing in an overcoat. Amazingly, he didn’t even begin his professional career until he was 24 because the Second World War intervened.

JOHN CHARLES

He may have been the best all-round footballer to have come out of Britain. A monster on the pitch; fearless and strong, a real powerhouse. Nat Lofthouse said he was the best defender he played against and Billy Wright said he was the best striker he ever faced.

Where are poor Paul Gascoigne's friends now he needs their help?

Dalglish had West Ham stars standing and applauding at 15... then he signed for Celtic!

Alan Hansen reminded me of Bobby Moore, that's why he's in my team of the Eighties 

John Robertson, Kevin Keegan and Phil Neal make my team of the Seventies 

Giggs would have solved England's problems... he was born to play left wing 

Wenger heralded a change... he introduced Prozone and scouting reports to England

Ravel Morrison has the class of Bale but his attitude is holding back his talent 

Vieira and Keane are warriors... they were even prepared to do battle while on TV!

Why Redknapp fears that the English manager is in danger of becoming extinct  

Vieira nearly crossed North London to join Spurs... and  Suarez was close to signing too 

Pies in the canteen and throwing teacups at players... the Premier League killed all that!
