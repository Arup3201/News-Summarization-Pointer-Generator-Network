Director Kevin Smith has penned a Hammer horror style film based on the advert

Many struggle to find a housemate who is the perfect match for them.

But one intriguing advert that offered a rent-free room in exchange for the lodger 'dressing and speaking' like a walrus was so successful that it has inspired a Hollywood film.

The Gumtree post described how a home owner had spent months 'constructing a realistic walrus costume' that his lodger would have to wear for a minimum of two hours a day, while communicating in the 'voice of a walrus' and eating fish that was thrown to them by their landlord.

The request was inspired by the poster's 'fulfilling friendship' with a walrus called Gregory while he lived otherwise alone on an island just west of Alaska.

Now having moved to Brighton to enjoy their retirement, the landlord wants to revive the 'most fascinating years of their life' by recreating the relationship with someone who could realistically portray a walrus.

The extraordinary advert caught the eye of many after it was posted on June 11 and went viral, with the landlord saying they had been inundated with people keen to try on the outfit and audition for the role.

And one high-profile person who was enchanted by the advert was director Kevin Smith, who has been inspired to pen a Hammer horror-style film about the advert.

The director, whose films include Clerks and Mallrats, plans to set 'Tusk' in Canada, the Independent reported.

The plot revolves around a 'mad scientist intending to sew some hapless lodger into counterfeit blubber', according to the newspaper.

Quentin Tarantino and Michael Parks are being considered for roles in Tusk, the Metro reported.

The Gumtree advertised for a flatmate with the proviso that they dress like a walrus

The unusual request that started the film began with: 'Among the many things I have done in my life is to spend three years alone on St. Lawrence Island.

'These were perhaps the most intense and fascinating years of my life, and I was kept in companionship with a walrus whom I named Gregory.

'Never have I had such a fulfilling friendship with anyone, human or otherwise, and upon leaving the island I was heartbroken for months.

'This is a position I am prepared to offer for free (eg: no rent payable) on the fulfillment of some conditions.

'I have, over the last few months, been constructing a realistic walrus costume, which should fit most people of average proportions, and allow for full and easy movement in character.

'To take on the position as my lodger you must be prepared to wear the walrus suit for approximately two hours each day (in practice, this is not two hours every day - I merely state it here so you are able to have a clear idea of the workload).

'Whilst in the walrus costume you must be a walrus - there must be no speaking in a human voice, and any communication must entail making utterances in the voice of a walrus - I believe there are recordings available on the web - to me, the voice is the most natural thing I have ever heard.

'Other duties will involve catching and eating the fish and crabs that I will occasionally throw to you whilst you are being the walrus.

'With the exception of this, you will be free to do whatever you choose, and will have a spacious double room, complete run of the house.'

A new lodger has been found, the advert later said.
