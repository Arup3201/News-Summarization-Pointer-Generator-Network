Kathie Lee Gifford has claimed that Bill Cosby tried to kiss her during their comedy tour in the 70s.

The Today host, who has been a staunch defender of the comedian in the wake of mounting sexual assault allegations, opened up about her experience on the show on Tuesday morning.

Gifford said the incident took place when she was touring with Cosby, who was married to wife Camille at the time.

'I will admit, towards the very last times I saw him, he did try to kiss me,' she said. 'I said, "Bill, no, we're friends," and he said, "OK, goodnight," and I said, "Goodnight." And I went to my room, and he went into his room.'

Speaking out: Kathie Lee Gifford revealed on the Today show on Tuesday morning that Bill Cosby tried to kiss her in the 1970s - but when she rebuffed his advances, 'he respected it'

Uncertainty: She said that she was not saying Cosby's accusers were lying, just that she had never seen any similar conduct. She said that he had treated her with 'great kindness and generosity'

Gifford said that she felt a 'chill' when she heard that supermodel Beverly Johnson accused Cosby of giving her a cappuccino spiked with a drug. 

'I do know that I got a chill because every night when we'd come off stage and Bill would be going on-stage, he would have made cappuccinos for all three of us,' she said, referring to her backup dancers.

'And I always thought it was such a kindness and it was so sweet, and now you see Beverly Johnson saying that he made her a cappuccino, and I just don't want it to be true, but I'm not saying that the women are liars... I'm just saying I never personally saw it with my own two eyes.' 

She went on: 'A lot of married men come onto single women... but once I said, "No, absolutely not," he respected it.'

Friends: Gifford, with Cosby and co-host Hoda Kotb, toured with the comedian for two years in the 70s

Support: Her claims come a day after Cosby's wife Camille, pictured together in November, slammed the media coverage of the accusations - suggesting he was the real victim

Throughout the segment, she insisted that Cosby had acted with 'great kindness and generosity' over the two years they worked together.

More than two dozen women, including model Janice Dickinson, have claimed that Cosby, now 77, drugged and sexually assaulted them in incidents stretching from the 1960s until the 2000s.

He has denied any wrongdoing and no criminal charges have ever been brought - but in 2006, he did settle a civil lawsuit with a woman who claimed he drugged and raped her in 2004.

Her comments come a day after Camille Cosby broke her silence. She compared the media's handling of the reports to Rolling Stone's botched coverage of the UVA rape scandal.

'There appears to be no vetting of my husband's accusers before stories are published or aired,' she said. 'An accusation is published, and immediately goes viral... None of us will ever want to be in the position of attacking a victim. But the question should be asked - who is the victim?'
