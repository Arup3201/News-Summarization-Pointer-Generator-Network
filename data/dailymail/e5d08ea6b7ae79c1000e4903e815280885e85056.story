A jilted boyfriend stalked his teenage former girlfriend incessantly before stabbing her to death outside her apartment in a jealous rage, it was claimed today.

Jonathan Pena Castillo, 21, would call medical assistance student Edith Rojas, 19, at 'all hours of the night' and show up unannounced at her family's home in Inwood, New York, according to her brother Ronny Peralta.

Mr Peralta, 27, said his sister dumped Castillo about 8 months ago after enduring months of obsessive behaviour, but he continued harassing her.

He told the New York Post: 'He was a possessive guy. He has to be calling her all the time So she decided not to keep going with him.

'She told my mom ... that he had problems, like he was a possessive guy.

'He wanted to be always calling her, always harassing her. He didn't want her to be with nobody else. Not hanging out with nobody else, calling at all times of the night.'

Castillo is accused of stabbing Miss Rojas and watching her bleed to death on the sidewalk outside her house.

Jose Quintanas, the superintendent in her
building, called her murder 'a terrible thing' to DNAinfo.com and had the tragic task of hosing her blood of the sidewalk.

After he stabbing neighbours raced down to the street to discover her in the arms of her wailing mother with Castillo still hovering nearby.

When confronted, Castillo reportedly raced off to a nearby park and disappeared.

Mr Peralta added: 'As soon as we came downstairs, [Castillo] was just standing, facing her, watching her die. Since we recognized him, he started running. Everybody started chasing him.

'He was just standing there, facing her. Everybody started chasing him. People with dogs let the dogs on him. He went to the park and disappeared.

'By the time I got there, he’d already stabbed himself. He still had the knife in his hands.'

Police found Castillo in nearby Inwood Hill Park where he is believed to have stabbed himself in the neck and abdomen with the same knife he’s accused of using on Rojas.

He is currently in custody at St. Luke's Hospital where he is in a medically induced coma but expected to survive, police sources said.
