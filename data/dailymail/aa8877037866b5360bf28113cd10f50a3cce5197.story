A Florida man was arrested for calling 911 three times, not for an emergency, but for a date, authorities say.

Stephen Ramsey, 45, of Naples, called 911 several times and, in a seven-minute phone call, asked the dispatcher for a date and how she felt about handcuffs, before laughing and hanging up the phone.

The dispatcher was patient with the drunkard, deciphering his slurs and repeatedly asking him  if he needed help.

Arrested: Police arrested Stephen Ramsey, 45, after he drunkenly called 911 several times looking for a date

Her patience endured to the very end. When Ramsey asked her for a date she responded 'I don't think I would call 911 looking for a date. That's not something you do.'

At one point, Ramsey asked the dispatcher where he could get an ambulance. He then told her 'I don't need one. I'm just asking.'

Ramsey was sitting in his car, in his driveway drunk when he made the calls.

When police arrived to arrest Ramsey, he told them he had drinking problems and was looking for an 'escort service to pass the time.' 

Instead of passing the time, Ramsey was wasting valuable time.

Misuse: Bill Rule, commander of communications at the Collier County Sheriff's Office, said that police have a hard time serving the public when someone misuses the 911 system

Authorities say Ramsey was slurring his speech heavily and his breath smelled strongly of alcohol.

Deputies told ABC 7 that the time the dispatcher spent on the phone with Ramsey could have been used helping someone else.

Ramsey is in jail with bail set at $2,000.
