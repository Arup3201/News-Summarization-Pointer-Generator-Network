Storms delayed the start of the U.S. Open semi-final and when it finally began Andy Murray ensured the electric atmosphere transferred to the court as he became embroiled in an angry row after his cap was blown off.

The incident happened during Murray's tough victory over Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic which set up him for a final clash scheduled for tomorrow against either Novak Djokovic or David Ferrer.

From the start of the match windy conditions disrupted play causing the net sensor to go off in the opening game.

Then, with World number 4 Murray on break point in the fourth game, he raced towards the net and as he successfully reach a short ball his white baseball cap flew off.

Berdych failed to get Murray's response however, and umpire Pascal Maria initially awarded the point to Murray.

Berdych, who has a winning record against Murray, then approached the umpire and argued he had been put off by the flying hat and the pair became engaged in an argument.

Murray also approached the chair and could be heard asking Berdych if was certain he had been distracted by the flying hat.

He repeated: 'I'm just asking if you're 100 percent sure.'

Maria decided to replay the point and an attempted lob by Murray sailed out of the court giving Berdych the break of serve.

A furious Murray then hit a ball in anger, grabbed the hat and dumped it on the sideline, saying 'nonsense, nonsense, nonsense.'

But, although Murray went on to lose a tight 
first set, it was he who ultimately coped with the conditions better, surviving a 
fightback in the fourth set from Berdych to win 5-7, 6-2, 6-1, 7-6 (9/7)
in three hours and 58 minutes.

It will be the 25-year-old's second 
consecutive grand slam final after his Wimbledon loss to Roger Federer 
and his second US Open final, with his first experience of a major 
showpiece coming here in 2008, when he also lost to Federer.

Talking about the conditions 
afterwards to CBS, Murray said: 'You have to focus for every point. The 
chairs were flying onto the court, it was hard to serve.

'It's some of the hardest conditions I've ever played in and I come from Scotland so that's saying something.'

He added: 'From the end of the first 
set I was in control. At 3-0 in the fourth I had three break points, but
from the far side of the court it was very tough so I got broken in the
next game. I just tried to hang in there and I did a good job at the 
end.'

The result also means Murray will 
overtake Rafael Nadal to become the new world number three, but most 
importantly it gives him the chance to claim his first grand slam title.

Murray will meet either defending 
champion Novak Djokovic or Spain's David Ferrer in the final and, asked 
if he feels this is his time after winning Olympic gold, Murray said: 'I
hope so. You can never say for sure, I know how hard these tournaments 
are to win. David and Novak are top, top players.

'When the conditions are like this, anything could have happened. I'll give everything in the final.'

Murray went into the match as the favourite by ranking and experience at the latter stages of grand slams but also knowing Berdych had won four of their six previous matches.

The big-hitting Czech had also served notice of what a threat he would be by blasting past Federer in the quarter-finals.

The wind was certainly the winner in the early stages as the stands slowly filled up and planes roared overhead.

Murray piled the pressure on Berdych in a lengthy third game and got the break when the sixth seed drilled a forehand just wide.

Murray thought he had saved a break point in the next game but Berdych protested he had been distracted by his opponent's hat blowing off and, after a heated exchange between the two men and umpire Pascal Maria, the point was replayed and the Czech broke back to 2-2.

Berdych was struggling with his ball toss to such an extent that at times he was serving at little more than 80mph but he was certainly hitting the ball cleanly off the ground.

Nice finish: Murray wins a point with a cool shot at the net

Holding serve into the wind was the 
main problem and Murray was furious with himself that he did not put 
more pressure on his opponent in the 11th game.

That left him serving to stay in the 
set for a second time and he could not manage it, the Scot struggling to
keep his cool as Berdych broke through with a mighty swipe of his 
forehand.

Murray was clearly fired up and 
immediately had three break points at the start of the second set, 
taking the second when Berdych pushed a forehand long.

The Scot seemed to be enjoying himself
a bit more now, taking on the challenge instead of being frustrated by 
it, and he broke again to lead 4-1.

On the attack: The powerful Berdych won the first set, but Murray's nous won through

Berdych held to force the third seed 
to serve out the set, but no sooner had Murray thrown the ball up for 
his first serve than a gust of wind blew his chair and racquet bag 
across the court.

The Czech laughed at the impossibility of playing tennis in such conditions but on they went and Murray duly wrapped up the set.

The Scot, who was being watched by 
countryman Sean Connery, began the third set as he had the second, with a
break of serve, as Berdych shot an exasperated look towards his 
supporters.

Murray's greater variety and tactical 
acumen suited the conditions much better than the Czech's raw power and 
another break for 3-0 gave him a firm hold on the match.

Serving up a treat: Murray's craft and guile was there for all to see across four compelling sets

Mentally, Berdych seemed to have gone 
walkabout and, although he saved four set points at 1-5, a fifth arrived
and this time the Czech drilled a forehand just long.

Berdych's hopes of making a second 
grand slam final were hanging by a thread, and they took another hit 
when Murray broke again in the second game of the fourth set.

The sixth seed stopped the run of 
games against him at five, saving more break points, and that seemed to 
revitalise him as he then created a rare opening on the Murray serve and
took it.

Suddenly it was a match again, albeit 
one that was still very much in the third seed's hands, but if he was 
going to win it in four sets it would have to be in a tie-break.

Murray was unfortunate that he started
the game at the more difficult end and Berdych raced into a 4-1 lead, 
but the Scot recovered the deficit when they switched ends, levelling at
5-5 with an angled backhand return.

Berdych played a good point to move 
6-5 in front but Murray saved the set point and then brought up his 
first match point only to see the Czech fire down an ace.

Berdych erred with his forehand, 
though, to give Murray a match point on his own serve, and another 
mistake from the Czech sent his opponent leaping around the court in 
delight.

The second semi-final between Novak Djokovic and David Ferrer in the Arthur Ashe Stadium had to be postponed due to the heavy rain.
