Mary Beard has weighed into the debate over Prince William studying at Cambridge University by saying he should use the opportunity to meet ordinary students.

The Cambridge classicist and TV presenter said it would give the second in line to the throne a chance to learn about those who fear falling into debt or failing to see their hard work translate into successful careers.

Her intervention follows anger over the decision to allow William to take a bespoke course in agricultural management even though he achieved an A, B and C in his A-levels – grades described as mediocre by the university newspaper.

Some students claimed William was getting a free pass and said it gave the impression that he was accepted because he was ‘posh and rich’.

Cambridge normally requires an A* and two As from would-be undergraduates.

The university pointed out that different admission rules apply for William’s agricultural course, and that he already has a degree, from St Andrews.

Yesterday Professor Beard told the Daily Mail: ‘I very much hope that he will take the opportunity to meet some of our more “ordinary” students, struggling with making ends meet, worried about careers, future and debt.’

The academic has become Britain’s best-known classicist after presenting several BBC historical documentaries, mainly on the Romans. She has also spoken out on a range of subjects, including internet trolls who posted nasty comments about her looks.

Her remarks follow research which shows students will run up £45,000 of debt on average during a three-year course. Many also face uncertainty in the jobs market and will struggle to save for a home as they try to pay off what they owe.

William, 31, who has a geography degree from St Andrews University, starts a £10,000 ten-week course this week to give him an understanding of issues surrounding farms and rural communities.

University newspaper The Tab ran an article last week which said: ‘Normally, students need A*AA at A-level to gain entry to Cambridge University, while the prince only achieved a mediocre ABC.’

Melissa Berrill, who graduated in French and German last year, said William had been given a ‘free pass’ which was ‘an insult to every student, whatever their background, who got into Cambridge by getting the required A-level or degree results’.

Natural sciences student Tim Squirrell said he feared the public would ‘assume that he’s been let in simply because he’s posh and rich’.

Other students could not wait for William to arrive, however, with one describing it as ‘the most exciting news ever’.

Cambridge academics also defended William. Professor David Abulafia, of the Faculty of History, said: ‘One of the functions of a great university is to educate some of those who are destined for leadership.’

William’s course, run through the university’s School of Technology, will involve around 20 hours of lectures, seminars and meetings each week, as well as study at home and field trips.

A university spokesman said: ‘A*AA is our standard offer for undergraduate admission. The Duke of Cambridge has already undertaken his undergraduate studies, at St Andrews.

‘He is not attending as an undergraduate or as a mature student. He is attending Cambridge to complete an executive education programme, for which different admissions criteria apply.’
