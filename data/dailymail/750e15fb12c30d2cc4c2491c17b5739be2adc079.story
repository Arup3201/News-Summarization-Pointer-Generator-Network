Wales' preparations for the World Cup next year are set to include training camps in Switzerland and Qatar.

Wales coach Warren Gatland confirmed the plans during the launch of a new partnership between the Welsh Rugby Union and Mercedes-Benz South Wales on Wednesday that will see cars provided to coaches, players and staff until 2018.

The camps are set to take place ahead of Wales' World Cup warm-up games next summer.

Preparation: Wales will head to Switzerland and Qatar for training camps before the World Cup in 2015

Ready: Wales head coach Warren Gatland wants to ensure his players are in peak condition for next year

'We have got a high-altitude camp in Switzerland, which is being planned, and we are doing a warm weather camp in Qatar,' Gatland said.

'I think we have got 12-14 days in Switzerland. We are going to sleep high, train low, going up by cable car to sleep.

'We have had that planning in place for the last three months or so and have prepared for all that.

'The thing with the altitude training is not so much that you train at it, it's just the physiological benefits you get from it.

'The challenge is doing that in Switzerland at altitude and also at 45-50 degrees centigrade in Qatar.'

Deal: Wales players, coaches and backroom staff will get Mercedes-Benz cars in a new agreement

Under the deal with Mercedes, a total of 89 new cars will be distributed throughout the WRU's workforce, including to Gatland and his coaching assistants Rob Howley, Robin McBryde, Shaun Edwards and Neil Jenkins.

'This is the latest new sponsorship agreement for the WRU Group, following on from the announcement of our new international travel partner last month,' WRU chief executive Roger Lewis said.

'This is perhaps an appropriate time for us to reflect upon the high value of the WRU brand itself in the global market-place.'
