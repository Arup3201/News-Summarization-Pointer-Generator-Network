A report has cleared the BBC of offending Prince Harry, after 
suggesting the prince took cocaine, because it is 'tradition' to poke 
fun at the royals

They serve our nation and represent hundreds of years of history.

But according to the BBC, the Royal Family have another, less dignified, role... giving us something to laugh about.

A report has cleared the satirical quiz show Have I Got News For You of offending Prince Harry, on the basis that it is a ‘tradition’ to poke fun at the royals.

Last October, guest presenter Jo Brand suggested the prince took cocaine. Reading from an autocue, she said: ‘George’s godparents include Hugh van Cutsem... I presume that’s a nickname, as in Hugh van cuts ‘em and Harry then snorts ‘em.’

She was criticised at the time by the 
former head of the Army, Lord Dannatt, who said the suggestion the 
Queen’s grandson – who is a qualified Apache helicopter pilot - took 
drugs was ‘outrageous’ and ‘most inappropriate’.

Defence
 minister Anna Soubry added: ‘That is disgraceful, shoddy, appalling and
 out of order. Prince Harry does an outstanding job in the Army and 
always goes the extra mile to help wounded service personnel and 
veterans.’

The BBC Trust yesterday backed bosses who refused to apologise, saying that viewers were not likely to take the comedy programme seriously.

Its report added: ‘The committee agreed that the content of the programme would have
 been likely to meet the likely audience expectation of due accuracy for
 a long-established satirical comedy programme of this kind.

‘It
 noted the show included jokes which were playing on far-fetched 
situations, unlikely juxtapositions and improbable word plays.

‘The committee also noted that it was in the tradition of British comedy to extract broad humour from the Royal Family.’

Comedian Jo Brand made the joke on BBC show Have I Got News For You 
in October last year when she appeared as a guest presenter

The BBC did apologise for getting Mr Van Cutsem’s name wrong. Prince George’s godfather is called William van Cutsem.

Miss Brand, 56, is well known for her republican views and has turned down invitations to appear at the Royal Variety Performance.

In spring last year, the BBC was forced to axe a Comic Relief routine by Scots comedian Frankie Boyle after he said he wished the Queen was dead and made crude sexual remarks about the Duchess of Cambridge.
