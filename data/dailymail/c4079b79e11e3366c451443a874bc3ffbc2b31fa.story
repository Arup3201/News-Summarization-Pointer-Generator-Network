Being expected to do household chores isn't just a bug bear of modern women – female Neanderthals had a similar dilemma.

A new study of Neanderthal teeth has discovered that our ancient cousins required women to do typical household chores, while also expecting them to hunt alongside men.

The study suggests women in the group were responsible for looking after furs and adjusting garments, while men had the task of improving stone tools.

The Spanish National Research Council made the discovery after analysing 99 incisors and canine teeth of 19 Neanderthals found in Spain, France and Belgium. Pictured is one of the specimens used in the study

Scientists at Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) in Madrid analysed 99 incisors and canine teeth of 19 Neanderthals found at sites in Spain, France and Belgium.

The fossils in Spain dated back 100,000 years, in France 50,000 years, and in Belgium the ancient teeth were believed to be 44,000 years old.

Regardless of age, Neanderthals had dental grooves.

'This is due to the custom of these societies to use the mouth as a third hand, as in some current populations, for tasks such as preparing the furs or chopping meat, for instance,' said Antonio Rosas, CSIC researcher.

But the study found grooves present in the female fossils followed the same pattern, and were different to those found in male individuals.

'What we have now discovered is that the grooves detected in the teeth of adult women are longer than those found in adult men,' said Professor Rosas.

Researchers believe Neanderthals used their mouths as a third hand for tasks such as preparing the furs or chopping meat.

In July, the biggest collection of ancient human fossils ever recovered lent weight to this theory. 

The collection reveals how Neanderthals developed their distinctive teeth before their brains, using them as a third hand for holding objects.

The study adds to theories that the Neanderthals evolved their characteristic looks slowly, and intermittently, over hundreds of thousands of years.

The ancient skulls, dating back 400,000 years, show Neanderthal-like features in the face and teeth, while other parts of the skulls, including the brain case, resembled those of more primitive human ancestors.

This suggests the earliest Neanderthals used their jaws in a particular way for chewing as well as for holding objects. 

The discovery at the Sima de los Huesos site in Spain's Atapuerca Mountains has allowed scientists to better understand pre-human evolution during the Middle Pleistocene period - a time in which the path of hominin evolution has been controversial and fiercely debated.

'Therefore we assume that the tasks performed were different'.

The tiny nicks of the teeth enamel were also analysed.

Male individuals show a greater number of nicks in the enamel and dentin of the upper parts, while in female individuals these imperfections appear in the lower parts.

It is still unclear which activities corresponded to women and which ones to men.

However, the authors of the study note that, as in modern hunter-gatherer societies, women may have been responsible for the preparation of furs and the elaboration of garments.

Researchers state that the retouching of the edges of stone tools seems to have been a male task.

Almudena Estalrrich, CSIC researcher at the Spanish National Museum of Natural Sciences, adds: 'We believe that the specialisation of labour by sex of the individuals was probably limited to a few tasks.

'It is possible that both men and women participated equally in the hunting of big animals'.

'The study of Neanderthals has provided numerous discoveries in recent years,' Rosa adds.

'We have moved from thinking of them as little evolved beings, to know that they took care of the sick persons, buried their deceased, ate seafood, and even had different physical features than expected: there were redhead individuals, and with light skin and eyes.

'So far, we thought that the sexual division of labour was typical of sapiens societies, but apparently that's not true'.

The study looked at the teeth of 19 individuals from three different sites in El Sidron, in Asturias, Spain, L'Hortus in France, and Spy in Belgium
