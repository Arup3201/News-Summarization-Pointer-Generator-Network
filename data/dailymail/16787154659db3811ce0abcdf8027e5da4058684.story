It's the sight every diver fears - a fearsome four-metre long shark eerily drifting into view as the support boat bobs far away on the horizon.

But that is what faced divers Dave Richards and Nathan Podmore when they went spearfishing off the western coast of Australia at the weekend.

The pair spent a terrifying three minutes trying to fend the shark off with nothing but spear guns and a knife as the animal circled around them.

Unnerving: Dave Richards and Nathan Podmore spent three minutes fending off a shark when it approached them in waters off the coast of western Australia

Eventually the shark swam away and the duo were able to make their way back to the safety of their nearby boat.

Amazing the dramatic scene was all recorded by a camera attached to Mr Podmore's head.

Mr Richards described the frightening attack to Australia's West Australian.

He said: 'I was on the top of the water getting ready to go down and I felt something moving behind me.

'I turned around and all I saw was the back section of the shark. Mate, it was a metre away. My heart sank and I just tried to get Nathan's attention.'

The divers were ten minutes into the trip when the shocking encounter took place.

Distant: The pair's boat can be seen in the video 150ft away - too far for the divers to reach

In the video the boat can be seen on the horizon, about 150 feet away and the pair had no choice but to stand their ground.

The shark launched the attack close to the surface and the camera shows both men constantly bobbing above and below the water.

Incredibly they remained calm throughout the encounter and were able to send the shark on its way by prodding it with their spear guns.

As the above video shows, they were understandably overjoyed when they arrived back at their boat unharmed.

In an interview with 7News Mr Richards added: 'In the water it just looked massive.

'I think if it wanted to it could have made a meal out of us, really.'

On the same day as Mr Podmore and Richards' heart-stopping meeting with the shart, a great white attacked a kayaker off the coast of California.

The shark took a bite out of the kayak and knocked the man into the water, but he was unhurt.
