Dressed in a black bra and thong, Charley, 18, from Edinburgh, gyrates her way through a crowd of men, many drunk and leering.

But this is one stripper who doesn't live up to the stereotype. Charley spends her evenings taking her clothes off to pay for a degree in sports science - her passport, she hopes, to a better life. 

'Stripping is just an escape from everything,' she explains. 'I go in there and I'm a completely different person.'

Big plans: Charley is using the proceeds of her stripping career to help fund herself through university

Charley, who grew up in one of the less salubrious parts of Edinburgh, adds: 'A
 lot of people that I grew up with don't really care and just skive.

'I'm
 totally the opposite. Because the place I live in isn't a very good 
area, I want to be better and do my family proud. To do that, I am a 
stripper.'

With universities charging £9,000 a year or more in tuition fees, she's far from being the only student to turn to sex work to survive.

A recent study published by the British Journal of Sociology of Education found that as many as one in three strippers are students and blamed the figure on the increasing costs of tuition fees.

And it's not just strip clubs that have benefited from students who turn to sex work to pay their fees.

Others fund their studies by turning to sugar daddy websites such as Sponsor A Scholar, where girls are paid up to £15,000 a year in exchange for 'companionship'.

Determined: Charley says she will do whatever it takes to overcome her deprived upbringing

 'A
 lot of people that I grew up with don't really care and just skive. I'm
 totally the opposite. Because the place I live in isn't a very good 
area, I want to be better and do my family proud. To do that, I am a 
stripper.'

Experts have also claimed that one of the reasons for the increase in student sex workers is that the work is becoming more socially acceptable.

Speaking to the Times Higher Education magazine, sociologist Teela Sanders said that some student strippers saw themselves as 'dancers, not sex workers' because 'selling striptease had become more palatable and socially acceptable.'

For Charley, who still lives at home with her father, stripping is the first job she's ever had and she admits she was thrilled when she was told she'd got it.

'I applied for a lot of jobs before and I
 kept getting knocked back because I had no experience,' she explains.

'I have no idea 
how I had the confidence to walk in here... It's crazy. It just sort of 
happened really quickly.

'I was so excited afterwards. I was thinking 
"I'm 18 and I've got a job!" I went and had icecream afterwards to celebrate.'

She now spends six nights a week working at Baby Dolls, one of three strip clubs that make up Edinburgh's 'Pubic Triangle'.

It's not always easy, although Charley, who makes around £100 a night, says the work has given her extra confidence.

'When I was at school, the boys found some girls 
attractive but not once did they look at me,' she remembers.

Different world: Charley is just 18-years-old and says stripping is the first and only job she's ever had

Relationship: Charley won't allow her boyfriend Connor to see her at work for fear of hurting him

'They [the other girls] were all really skinny
 with nice clothes, and nice hair, and I was a bit chubby. I got into 
dancing to prove that I can be 
beautiful, I can be sexy.

She adds: 'A year ago, I couldn't get on buses without being 
really anxious. I feel better about myself, even though dancing maybe 
isn't the prettiest job in the world and I know some people would say it's sleazy.

'I walk out with my head held high and it's empowering.'

Boyfriend Connor doesn't share her enthusiasm however and says he worries about Charley's safety when she's at work.

'I think [strip clubs] can be seedy places and I'm
 worried for her wellbeing,' he reveals. 'I think I might get a bit jealous if I was 
to see her doing sexy provocative stuff... I think "that's just for me!"
 but at the end of the day, I know it's just her job.'

New life: Charley hopes to one day swap stripping for a job as a police woman after college

Charley herself has imposed a set of strict rules on Connor and refuses to let him go to the club where she works.

'I don't want him to see me doing this,' she admits. 'I
 think it would hurt him too much. He just means too much to me for me 
to do that to him.'

Ultimately, for Charley, stripping, however distasteful, is a means to an end and a route out of the grim estate where she grew up and still lives.

'I really hate where I live,' she admits. 'It's a horrible, 
horrible place. I wouldn't bring my children up here and I kind of hate that I 
was brought up here.'

Her goal, she says, is to use her sports science degree to become a policewoman. 'I like that you get to be a strong independent woman,' she smiles.

'I like the idea of helping the public and dealing with tough situations.' She's certainly no stranger to the latter.
