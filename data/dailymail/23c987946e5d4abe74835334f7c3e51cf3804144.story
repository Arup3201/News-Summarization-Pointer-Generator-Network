He was legendary for the parties that were thrown at his UFO-shaped house in Palm Springs. 

But the home Bob Hope actually lived in with his family - and where he died in 2003 - in Los Angeles has been put up on the market for $23 million.

The Toluca Lake mansion - called The Hope Estate, naturally -  is set on 5.2-acres in the San Fernando Valley and has everything you would expect from the screen and stage veteran and his wife, Dolores.

Avid golfers, the pair installed a one-hole, 3-par course in their backyard, which was so big that President Nixon's helicopter once landed there, Yahoo Homes reported.

Linda Hope, one of the couple's four children, said it was her parents' 'dream house'.

Built in 1939, the six bedroom, seven bathroom house is drenched in history.

From the guests it had entertained - Lucille Ball was a regular - to a long-running family joke that Dolores would 'add a room' whenever her husband went away on tour.

'When Dad came back, Mother would joke that he'd need a road map to find the bedroom,' Linda told The LA Times. 

The home has been renovated over the years, including an extensive overhaul in the 1950s that installed walls of glass.

There is a family room, bar and billiard room, formal dining room, informal dining room, a library and an office 

The grounds feature a glass-encased indoor pool as well as an outdoor pool and a rose garden, according to Forbes.

There is also a two-bedroom, two-bath pool house plus a 4,000-square-foot guest house, where Hope’s staff lived.

Hope passed away at the home aged 100.

Dolores then died there in 2011 aged 102.

The home has never been sold before but was first placed on the market by the family in 2013 for $27.5 million.

It was then delisted.

The estate has now been relisted at $23 million.

The family have struggled to sell the modernist compound Hope built in Palm Springs in the 1970s.

The iconic behemoth was designed by architect John Lautner to look like a volcano, however the end result made it more like a mushroom or, as Hope once said, a martian.

Iconic: The concrete, steel and glass house was built in 1979 and has about 22,000 square feet of living space, and its unique design is somewhat reminiscent of the USS Enterprise

Futuristic: The home owes its space age look to a design by famed modernist architect John Lautner

That house originally went up for $50 million.

In December the price has cut in half to $24,999,000. 

Their children are hoping to offload them both. 

'The Moorpark house is a very special property in the Valley and something that meant a whole lot to my mother and dad,' Linda told the LA Times. she said. 

'They built what for them was kind of a dream house.'
