David Beckham and his son Brooklyn walked away from a nasty looking crash this weekend, but his car did not fare quite so well.

Photos have emerged showing the driver's side of his Audi RS6 badly damaged while the other car - believed to be a Mitsubishi Colt Coupe Cabriolet - was written off. 

The former England captain had just picked up his eldest from Arsenal’s training ground on Saturday when the smash happened.

Beckham, 39, had been at Arsenal's training centre at London Colney, Hertfordshire  watching his eldest son play for the club’s Under 16 side against Brighton.

The former Real Madrid and Manchester United midfielder was reportedly treated at the scene for minor injuries to his shoulder while Brooklyn was unhurt. 

Arsenal staff ushered onlookers away from the scene and Beckham was driven away in another car. Both were said to be shaken following the accident.

One Brighton youngster, Archie Davies, tweeted: ‘Just seen David Beckham looks like he got in a car crash and hurt his shoulder.’ The teenager then added: ‘Star struck by seeing David Beckham tbh.’

And team-mate Thomas Cadman thought the whole episode was utterly surreal, tweeting: ‘Weird to play against Brooklyn Beckham earlier. Even weirder to be currently stuck behind David Beckham as he has crashed his car.'  

Beckham's airbags are said to have been deployed in the smash.

It's not the first time Beckham has been involved in an car accident - in October last year he collided with a car when pulling out of his driveway in Beverley Hills.

He was allegedly in his black Range Rover Sport with what looked like his son Brooklyn, then aged 14, in the front passenger seat when the collision occurred on the afternoon of October 25.

Police were seen leaving his home, then interviewing witnesses nearby for more information about the accident.

Damage was clearly visible on the white Acura 4x4, as well as David's expensive Range Rover Sport, where the bumper was hanging off the front.

Brooklyn was signed by Arsenal on a short-term contract earlier this month after impressing coaches at the Emirates.

Brooklyn’s brother Romeo, 12, has also been playing for the club’s Under 13s, while youngest son Cruz, nine, has been representing the club’s Under 10s.

Brighton footballer Archie Davies tweeted that it appeared as though Beckham was injured. He later tweeted he was 'star struck' at seeing the former England international
