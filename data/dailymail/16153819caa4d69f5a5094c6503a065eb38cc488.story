Jason Donovan, Chelsee Healy and Nancy Dell'Olio first three contestants confirmed for Strictly tour

Having already appeared in the bottom two three times, it was little surprise that Audley Harrison and his partner Natalie Lowe in danger once more.

When placed against Strictly favourites Anita Dobson Robin Windsor, it was clear which couple would be back next week, and the boxer was finally sent home.

Craig said of his performance of the Cha Cha Cha: 'it was heavy, it was laboured, it was corpulent.'

Fourth time unlucky: Audley Harrison and Natalie Lowe's luck ran out tonight as they were finally voted off Strictly

Tough competition: Popular couple Anita Dobson and Robin Windsor were also in the bottom two

Bruth Forsyth will be disappointed, as he revealed last night that despite their low score of 20,  Audley  and Natalie were still his favourite couple.

Audley was gracious as he faced the prospect of leaving for the fourth time, saying before the results were announced that he didn't think Anita deserved to leave.

Anita drew a gasp of sympathy from the audience when she said that it the 'viewers have decided it was time' for her to go, then that was fair enough.

Gracioud: Audley said Anita deserved to stay, and she drew a gasp of sympathy from the audience when she said that it the 'viewers have decided it was time' for her to go, then that was fair enough

When asked what his Strictly highlight had been, Audley said: 'There have been many. There has been a lot, a lot of highlights. I’ve really enjoyed myself.

'Imagine the first week I was 100/1 to go out, so hopefully all those people who lost money on me with the David Haye fight, hopefully they got their money back!'

'It’s been great, I had a great time… I really enjoyed it,' he added.

Poor critique: Craig said of Audley's Cha Cha Cha 'it was leaden, it was heavy, it was laboured'

His partner, Natalie Lowe continued: 'I just want to thank all the people at home who voted, who kept us in. It’s been a great journey. Thank you!'

Their Cha Cha Cha drew the worst insult of the night, as Bruno said: 'National Rail on a Bank Holiday has better timing.'

He added: 'At this stage, you should give us more impact. I'm sorry, as I do like you a lot.'

Bottom of the table: Audley Harrison only scored 20 out of 40, but host Bruce Forsyth said he was his favourite

Len tried to continue the theme of the joke, quipping: 'The only way 
you're going to Wembley Arena (where the Strictly tour will take place) 
is on the Jubilee line.

'Your timing was good, you had rhythm. It wasn't your best dance, but you did your best.'

Even Alesha wasn't keen, adding: 'It’s harsh what the judges are saying but some of it is true. I just think this dance exposes you, because I do think you excel better in ballroom.'

'I know you’re working hard and I know you’re trying, and I commend you for that, but I just don’t think Latin – and this particular dance – suited you'

Defying her years: 62-year-old Anita Dobson's performance last night had youthful energy

Agile: Even though husband Brian May was in the audience, Anita did not hold back with partner Robin Windsor

Anita Dobson and Robin Windsor performed the same dance as top scorers Harry and Alino, with their Argentine Tango getting 33.

Bruno was impressed, saying: 'You unleashed her basic instinct. Sexy mama, queen of tango!'

While Alesha was overwhelmed with how good she looks for 62, adding: 
'You totally drew me into the story and you look sensational.'

Graceful: Ola Jordan and ex-footballer Robbie Savage are fast becoming audience favourites

Robbie Savage and Ola Jordan proved to be one of the most popular 
couples still left in the competition, drawing the loudest cheer from 
the audience last night.

They made a small improvement of two points on last week, scoring a total of 31.

Alesha gushed: 'You are constantly moving in the right direction. Great 
job!', while Bruno told him he was 'becoming a smooth operator'.

Sizzling: Harry Judd performs an electric performance with Aliona Vilani that left him top of the leader board on Strictly Come Dancing

Harry Judd and Aliona Vilani set television screens on fire with their passionate Argentine Tango.

Their electric performance on Strictly Come Dancing tonight also tipped the leaderboard with an impressive 37 out of 40.

However, a certain young lady might not be too happy about this particular routine.

Earlier this week, the McFly drummer revealed girlfriend Izzy Johnston was so riled by his dirty dancing that she gave him the silent treatment.

Passionate: Craig Revel Horwood told Harry and Aliona their performance was 'filth'

He said: 'When she (Izzy) came to watch us practice the tango, Aliona warned her that it was raunchy.

'I was almost biting her neck and really getting into it to show off... On the ride home Izzy was really quiet. She was freaked out a bit. She said, "Just don’t talk to me now - speak to me in the morning."'

Meanwhile, it was announced today that Jason Donovan, Chelsee Healey and Nancy Dell'Olio are the first three contestants confirmed to be part of the Strictly tour in January.
