Twenty townsfolk from Lismore in Australia, home of Tiger Woods's playing partner Rhein Gibson, were at Hoylake wearing T-shirts emblazoned 'Living the dream with Rhein'.

To play in a major on a Saturday alongside a 14-time winner is a fine achievement, although for Woods it might be a case of 'Living the reality with Rhein'.

This is it right now for Tiger, scraping over the line to make the cut and going out the next day with fellow non-contenders Gibson and the albeit precocious talent of  Jordan Spieth.

Disappointed: Woods admits he has made too many mistakes in his first Major back since surgery

Before this event began the 38-year-old American told the usual assembled throng of media that it would not be acceptable to finish anything other than first. Another unacceptable week, then, although it is increasingly stretching credibility for him, or anyone else, to believe this kind of thing.

It suits Woods and golf in general to perpetuate the myth but the hard fact is that you have to go back to the 2008 US Open for the last time he mounted the victor's podium at any of the big four events. Imagine Roger Federer not having won a Grand Slam for six years and still retaining a similar aura.

Under normal circumstances Woods would have been one of the early starters, the undercard attracting morning spectators before the likes of Rory McIlroy got under way.

Instead he was last off on the 10th tee as part of the reshuffle and the non-event of his eventual one-over- par round was summed up by its conclusion. Rather than soaking in the applause down the horseshoe arena of the 18th he finished out on the par-three ninth, before a minibus took him and his partners down a service road and back to the front of the main clubhouse.

Any momentum he has gained since Thursday has been halted by some dreadful hashes, such as the double and triple bogeys on the reverse back nine.

'I'm starting to get the flow of the round, the flow of playing again but I've just made too many mistakes,' he said. 'You can't run up high scores like that and expect to contend, especially when the conditions are this benign. 

'I've made two double bogeys and two triples, that adds up to a lot of shots. On top of that I missed a bunch of opportunities for birdies and so I'm three over par.'

Waiting: Woods hopes to iron out the errors in his game that caused him to drop shots this week

Twenty-five majors have now passed since his US Open triumph, although he has missed six of those through injury, two of which have been caused by the operations that make it look less and less likely that he will surpass Jack Nicklaus's tally of 18 majors.

The evidence increasingly suggests he will not pass that milestone. In Nicklaus's main window of winning all but one of his biggest trophies between 1962 and 1980, the longest he went between claiming a major was 10 events, but for Woods that hiatus is now up to 19.

If there is any consolation here it is that Saturday's damp conditions were the kind to encourage discomfort for someone returning from back surgery, but there at least does not appear to be any specific handicap coming from that.

What is inarguable is that he still exercises a fascination and hold over the sport unlike anyone else. What could be termed the fire hydrant and cocktail waitress factor might have something to do with it, and the galleries still strained their necks for a sight of the living legend.

Woods - still commanding his own dedicated 'Tigercast' channel on ESPN - birdied his first two holes to go to level par and at the turn there was the promise of a concerted climb up the leaderboard.

Yet he has found the second hole a particular problem and, after bogeying it on the first two days, went one worse when a double resulted from finding the bunker. He lost his ball in the gorse on the seventh (his 16th) and the reload went into the opposite rough, costing him the triple.

The serenity he talked about experiencing when winning at Hoylake in 2006 seems far away as he resumes at tied 58th, and it will take a strong final round to beat his season's best so far of finishing an unacceptable 25th.
