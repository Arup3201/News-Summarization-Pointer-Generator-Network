Hughes died in a Sydney hospital on Thursday surrounded by family, friends and teammates just three days before his 26th birthday.

Hughes, from Macksville, New South Wales, never recovered from a devastating head injury he sustained after a ball delivered by bowler Sean Abbott struck him in the back of the head while he was playing first-class cricket at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Tuesday afternoon. 

Legends of the cricketing world, including Ian Chappell, Sachin Tendulkar, Ian Botham, Shane Warne and Adam Gilchrist have paid tribute to the opener whose guts and determination defined his all-too-brief, yet spectacular, career.

'Just an absolute tragedy that Hughesy is no longer with us. He was such an awesome young man, RIP buddy, shattered...' came the tweet from spin-king Shane Warne. 

It was Gilchrist, who perhaps best captured the heartache of the nation and the sport’s worldwide community when he simply tweeted 'No no no no no. RIP Phillip Hughes'.

India's little master Sachin Tendulkar said: 'Shocked to hear about Phil. Sad day for cricket. Deepest condolences to family, friends and well wishers. RIP" From the Prime Minister Tony Abbott came this statement.

Flags have been lowered to half mast in London at the home of cricket, Lord's, as the English players, officials and fans join their Australian counterparts in mourning the death of the 25-year-old.

Hughes had stints with three English county sides - Middlesex, Hampshire and Worcestershire - between 2009 and 2012 and left a lasting impression both on and off the pitch. 

Play was also called off in the third test between Pakistan and New Zealand in Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday as a sign of respect.

The Pakistan Cricket Board and New Zealand Cricket agreed to suspend the second day's play as a tribute message and photos of Hughes adorned the ground's scoreboard.
