Police arrested him in Kalyan, the second stop, and spent days conducting scans and X-rays to find it.

Finally, on Christmas Day, an ultrasound showed the chain to be in his stomach.

'Gupta vehemently claimed he was innocent and passengers too could not find any chain on him.

'But a traveler said he had noticed Gupta swallowing something and assumed it must have been the chain,' police said.

Sampat Nirmal, senior inspector, told Time Of India: 'We initially conducted a regular X-ray but it didn't detect anything.

Passengers leaped up to detain Gupta when he stole the chain just minutes into the Vidarbha Express journey

Gupta was fed bananas for 24 hours - amounting to 96 - until the gold chain was retrieved on Thursday

'So on Wednesday, we conducted an ultrasound which revealed the chain in Gupta's abdomen.'

From Wednesday afternoon the accused was fed bananas, a natural laxative, by a doctor.

Finally, on Thursday afternoon, it was recovered.

Police said Gupta has since confessed he committed similar offences in his village in Uttar Pradesh, northern India, for which has he served jail terms.

Gupta claimed he was scared of being beaten up by the mob of passengers so he swallowed the chain.

Police are now working to deliver the chain to Dr Kamble, who lives in Akola, near Gondia.
