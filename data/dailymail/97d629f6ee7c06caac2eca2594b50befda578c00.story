Reputation trashed: Dr Edouard Yaacoub said he was driven to poverty after being struck off as a GP

A doctor has attacked the General Medical Council for 'ruining his life' when they struck him off over false sexual assault claims.

Dr Eduoard Yaacoub, 50, was struck off in 2011 after a disabled woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, accused him of a variety of sexual offences including rape.

The GP, who has now been cleared of any misconduct, said the four-year ordeal caused by the allegations ruined his reputation and career, leaving him in poverty.

The GMC ruling which led to Egyptian-born Dr Yaacoub being struck off was quashed by the High Court last year, but he was forced to attend another hearing over the case.

The panel concluded on Friday that his relationship with the patient had included 'a departure from professional standards' when he made a home visit and gave the patient a gift.

But it did not take any action over the finding, and it also did not apologise for the original mistake in striking him off.

The lack of repentance from the GMC also prompted an attack from Dr Yaacoub's lawyer, who called the panel 'bad losers'.

Speaking outside the hearing in Manchester, Dr Yaacoub said: ‘It has ruined my life for four years.

‘I didn’t rape the patient and didn’t do anything sexual.

‘They [the GMC] are now saying I breached the doctor/patient relationship by offering a blessing,’ he added.

‘This
is ridiculous. My profession was ruined, my reputation was ruined, my 
family was ruined and after four years, instead of saying sorry, they 
are saying you are breaching relationships by offering a gift.’

Mary O’Rourke QC, Dr Yaacoub's defence lawyer, added: ‘As a result of these 
false allegations by this witness he has suffered a loss of reputation, 
profession and income.

‘His 
children are living on the poverty line, he is unable to put fuel in his
car, he is unable to stay in a hotel in Manchester.’

‘He thinks it is a conspiracy against him and you can understand why he may think that.

‘This man’s life has been ruined and I don’t see that as an understatement in any way.

‘Has the GMC offered an apology? No. Is it a case that should not have come back? Yes.'

‘I’m
asking now [for an apology], but I know he’s not going to get one because although the 
GMC tells its doctors to admit when they get it wrong, it never admits 
when it gets it wrong.’

It was originally alleged that Dr Yaacoub had made a visit to the patient's home uninvited after visiting earlier in the day.

He was said to have forced open the legs of the patient, who suffers from spastic paraplegia, and performed a sex act in front of her.

The
woman gave a number of different versions of events, and eventually told the GMC in 2011 that she had been raped.

She
later repeated the claims in public when the case was re-heard in June, 
telling the panel she was left feeling ‘physically sick’ by the alleged 
assault.

During the hearing, Dr Yaacoub admitted making the initial visit on 17 January 2010, during which he offered her a small religious picture as a gift, but nothing more.

The panel accepted his evidence, but said the visit was ‘a departure from professional standards’, although they decided not to impose a warning.

Panel chair Gill Mullen told the doctor: ‘You have said in evidence that in your culture if one visits someone one should take a gift, but it was neither necessary for you to return to her, nor necessary for you to offer her a blessing of a religious nature.

‘Your offering of a blessing to Patient A in these circumstances was never part of the sexual allegations which the panel have rejected.

‘The panel does not regard your behaviour as amounting to misconduct which is serious or deplorable.

‘Accordingly, the panel has determined that your fitness to practise is not impaired by reason of misconduct.

‘In the panel’s judgment, however, your conduct was not merely unwise: it was a departure from standards properly expected of a doctor.’

It was after the hearing that Dr Yaacoub launched his attack on the GMC after the hearing, saying that he could have got divorced or committed suicide as a result of the ordeal.

He estimates that he has also lost at least £100,000 in earnings.

However, the GMC defended its role in the case, saying it 'had a duty to protect the public'.

Tom Kark, QC, for the GMC, said: ‘Comments have been made by Ms O’Rourke that the GMC should apologise.

‘She spoke about the basis being poor losers and spoke about wickedness and a conspiracy.

‘The GMC has a duty to protect the public. The reasoning given by Mr Justice Kenneth Parker did not say the patient’s evidence was incredible.

‘The failure was the failure of the panel to give sufficient reasons [for the findings].

‘Once the patient indicated a willingness to give evidence, the GMC acted absolutely appropriately in bringing the case before you and allowing you, an experienced panel, to make a decision on it.’
