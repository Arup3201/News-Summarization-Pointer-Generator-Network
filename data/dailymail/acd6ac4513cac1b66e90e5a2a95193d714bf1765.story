The new Botox? Dr Jean-Louis Sebagh, a well-known Harley Street doctors, claims his new treatment is 'as big and important as Botox was seven years ago'

When it was first revealed that women 
were paying to have a toxin injected into their faces in an attempt to hold back the march of time, there were howls of derision 
from the public.

That was 
more than two decades ago, and even when in 2002 cosmetic Botox received
 official approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, which 
evaluates new medical procedures, critics continued to pour scorn on the
 procedure.

But in recent years, legions of 
British women have taken up the habit - and celebrities such as Simon Cowell and Kim Kardashian have even tried it out - making it one of the most popular anti-ageing procedures of the decade.

However, while A-listers have been banishing wrinkles with Botox, one of their favourite cosmetic doctors has been quietly championing the next big thing.

Dr Jean-Louis Sebagh is an acclaimed Harley Street doctors who treats and has developed a range of topical creams with supermodel Cindy Crawford.

He says his new treatment is 'as big and important as Botox was seven years ago.'

Dr Sebagh, whose clinics in Paris 
and London's Wimpole Street are packed with the beautiful and the very 
rich (many fly in to see him the way most of us would pop to the shops), has been offering the treatment for 14 months.

On his website, he describes the 
£1,200 treatment as a 'technological innovation offering women what no 
treatment has ever provided in such a simple way: a redefined face, 
restored volume and reduced wrinkles by means of a 30-minute treatment 
at their doctor’s, for a result lasting up to 18 months.'

During the procedure, thread made of polylactic acid is drawn through the skin after injections of local anesthetic.

Dr Sebagh says that he uses the thread to give a tailor-made result, lifting specific parts of the face.

This acid 
is completely biodegradable and acts on the deeper layers of the skin 
and naturally stimulates the body so that it produces its own collagen.

He claims this
 action, which continues over time, helps increase the volume 
of saggy areas and restore shapeliness to the face gradually and naturally.

Is this goodbye Botox? The £1,200 treatment claims to offer women a redefined face, restored volume and reduced wrinkles by means of a 30-minute treatment, which promises to last up up to 18 months

Speaking to ES magazine
 about the procedure, he said: 'It's a thread that dissolves completely 
after 18 months, and it has an immediate lift and lasting regenerative 
effect, all along the thread.

'It
 really looks chic,' he said of the 30-minute treatment. 'It restores 
fat to the right place, with the right tension. It provides volume, but 
not too much. Not like all these weird faces we see puffed up like 
balloons.'

'I have used Silhouette Soft thread on ten women today, starting in the morning with a queen of one of the Middle Eastern countries,' he revealed.

Don't fancy having your face threaded or going back for top-ups every six months? Another hot new anti-ageing treatment is being offered by Dr Yannis Alexandrides of 111 Harley St.

How does it work? Dr Sebagh uses the thread to give a tailor-made result, lifting specific parts of the face. The thread, which is drawn through the skin after injections of local anesthetic, is made of polylactic acid

He swears by the Thermafrax lift, which doesn’t penetrate skin.

It’s a tighten, tone and resurface treatment that combines Thermage technology (Gwyneth Paltrow's favourite) and Fraxel resurfacing to provide what's described as the 'ultimate non-surgical face-lift'.

'It’s a one-off treatment that targets surface skin condition and also deeper layers of skin for a tight, youthful result,' says Dr Alexandrides.

'A surgical facelift requires two weeks minimum recovery time, and only combats sagging, aged skin.

The ThermaFrax Lift targets both the sagging, and improves skin texture with results that last up to 10 years.'
