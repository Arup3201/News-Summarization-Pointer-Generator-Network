It was the hobby he turned into a sport that has now changed is life forever.

Teenager Campbell Dawson was left paralysed from the chest down after he broke his neck on a trampoline.

As a child, Campbell's parents, Donna and Jared Dawson, say their son was always on the move, climbing on his hands or hanging upside down and found his calling when he discovered gymnastics and trampolining.

He competed in New Zealand and Australia at national level and was trying to put a new routine together for the National Championships when tragedy struck in March.

The accident on the double mini trampoline left Campbell, who moved from New Zealand to Brisbane in 2012, with a broken neck at C6, C7 and C1 and no feeling from the mid-chest down.

He spent a total of 231 days in hospital - five weeks in ICU at Brisbane's Prince of Alexandria hospital and was then transferred to Brisbane's Royal Children's Hospital.

Campbell finally got of out hospital two weeks ago but now faces months of rehabilitation and a lifetime of help and therapy due to the severity of his injuries.

Mum Donna, 41, has given up her job as an educator at the Brisbane School of Hairdressing to help care for her son. 

'Every day is hard, a challenge and we're just living one day a time at the moment,' she says. 

Campbell currently needs assistance bathing and dressing, moving in and around his bed and transferring in and out of his wheelchair, as well as crucial equipment such as hoists and a shower seat.

But because his family are not Australian citizens, they don't qualify for many of the benefits available in Australia, such as carer's allowance and money needed for vital equipment.

As a result Variety Queensland and the MASKS Foundation have stepped in and have so far managed to provide Campbell with approximately $50,000 worth of equipment such as an $8,000 wheelchair, $12,000 power-assist wheels and a special $20,000 clip that changes the chair from manual to electric.

Campbell's father, Jared, 45, the CFO at Brisbane Girls Grammar School, told the Daily Mail Australia: 'It's overwhelming how much support we've had from Variety and the MASKS foundation.

'Being New Zealand citizens we don't qualify for some of the funding and support, like carer's allowance, whereas an Australian citizen would.

'The funding from Variety and the MASK Foundation has enabled Campbell to have a wheelchair and we're getting some power-assist wheels, which means that when he pushes them they move a bit further and a clip that turns his wheelchair into an electric one.

'It's still early days and obviously his needs are constantly changing but at the moment they're helping with equipment and what comes next with physio and rehabilitation. 

The family, who moved to Australia in 2012 for Jared's work, hope to buy a house in the near future, but will need help with funding to modify it to Campbell's requirements, possibly even requiring a lift.

'We're still in the process of confirming exactly what equipment Campbell needs as the accident is so recent,' say Variety Queensland spokeswoman Penny Cameron. 'We're working closely with his therapists who have explained that his equipment requirements change very frequently.'

Donna says the youngster has an amazing spirit and is tackling his difficulties with the same strength he took on the trampoline.

'Most days he's really good and happy and positive,' she says, 'but he has his moments and we have some down days but they don't generally very last long. He's more upbeat than us sometimes.

'His schedule isn't really established yet,' she continues, 'but in rehabilitation they're working on the functions he does have and anything he gets back is a bonus - in April the doctor said he didn't think he'd ever be able to use a manual wheelchair but now he can.'

Donna says  the main source of comfort to the teenager has been his 18-year-old brother, Jayden, who recently presented him with a journal documenting their days since the accident.

'We've not seen it,' adds Donna, 'as it's very private and between them but Jayden gave it to him the other night when he was having a down moment and it completely blew him away.

'It was so thoughtful. They are best friends and he's been an incredibly amazing big brother and sometimes when Campbell has his down days he only wants his brother.'

The family appeared on Channel Nine's Today show Friday morning where Campbell was presented with Dodge Journey SXT by reporter Darren Wick courtesy of Dodge Chrysler.

Campbell told the Daily Mail Australia, 'I'm just overwhelmed, speechless,' he says, adding that their first journey in it will be to a follow-up hospital appointment on the Gold Coast next week.

'We're so grateful to our supporters for enabling us to help Campbell and his family and are also incredibly grateful to Channel Nine, The Today Show and the Jeep and Dodge team for making this wonderful surprise happen,' adds Ms Cameron.  

'Variety – the Children's Charity of Queensland, thanks to the generosity of our supporters, has been able to and will continue to assist Campbell with equipment he needs to live the most active and independent life possible – equipment such as an automatic bed and a new wheelchair are some of the items Campbell has and will require.'
