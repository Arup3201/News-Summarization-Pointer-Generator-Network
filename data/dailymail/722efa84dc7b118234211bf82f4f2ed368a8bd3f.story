Missing: Dale Smith, 51, and 4 relatives are missing after their plane engine experienced problems

A Mormon pilot and four of his family members are missing after reporting engine problems with their private plane while flying over remote wilderness on Sunday.

Dale Smith, 51, and his relatives, including his adult son, took off from Baker City, Oregon on Sunday morning and were heading to Butte, Montana.

But air traffic controllers in Salt Lake City received communication from Smith around 3.30pm that his six-seater plane, a Beech Bonanza, was experiencing engine troubles.

They directed him to the nearest landing site, the small and remote grass-covered Johnson Creek airstrip, which is about 125 miles north of Boise, Idaho - but the plane never landed, KTVU reported.

Now friends and family are praying 
for good news - calling the Mormon engineer, who lives with his large 
family in San Jose, California, an experienced and safe pilot.

His wife Janis was not on board the plane and has traveled to Idaho to be closer to the search. The family had spent Thanksgiving together in Oregon.

Family man: Mr Smith, who is Mormon, has been described as devoted to his family and his faith. He is pictured bottom center with his wife Janis, middle row left, and their children, including an adult son

Fears: Mr Smith, pictured, was flying over Idaho when he reported an engine failure on Sunday 
afternoon

National
Guard helicopters left Boise around 10.30am on Monday and tried to 
search the area but poor weather conditions forced them to end their 
efforts.

The weather is 
expected to improve today and the search will continue with Blackhawk 
helicopters, Civil Air Patrol and planes from the Idaho Transportation Department.

Fellow pilots told KTVU that they are hopeful the plane landed safely and is simply out of reach of cell phone coverage.

'We have no idea what the status of 
things is right now,' Valley County Shieriff's Lt. Dan Smith said. 'They could have landed safely 
somewhere and just can't communicate.'

Where is it? Smith was flying with his family in this Beech Bonanza, a six-seat single engine plane

Authorities
would not confirm that Smith was flying the plane, but did say the 
plane was registered in his name. He has owned it since at least 2008.

Smith was taking his adult son to Montana following the Thanksgiving weekend. Investigators confirmed that the other missing people are from the Smith family, but did not elaborate.

Rand Kriech, who co-founded a hardware and software company, SerialTek, with Smith, said his friend was an excellent pilot.

'He's one of the safest pilots I 
know. A very cautious pilot,' Kriech told NBC. 'Have no fear of flying 
with him at all. I'm a pilot myself and I really appreciate somebody 
that takes as much care as Dale.'

Route: Smith and four family members took off in his plane from Oregon Sunday morning for Montana but reported trouble in Idaho. They were directed to land at Johnson Creek airstrip

Remote: He had been directed to the grass-covered Johnson Creek airstrip in Idaho - but never made it

Their company was founded in 2007 and now employs around 10 staff, online records indicate.

Others said that despite all of his 
accomplishments, Smith is essentially a family man who was devoted to his 
community and Mormon faith.

'When
there was Hurricane Katrina, Dale was the first one to get in his 
plane, grab a bunch of members of the church and go out and help,' 
friend Ann Dyreng told KGO.

Smith obtained his pilot's license in 2005 and had a second-class medical certification, which allowed him to operate a commercial aircraft, the Associated Press reported.
