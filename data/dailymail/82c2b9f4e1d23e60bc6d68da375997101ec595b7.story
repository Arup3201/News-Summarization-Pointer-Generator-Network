Women across the country are to have the right to find out if their boyfriend has a secret violent past.

Clare’s Law, which enables them to ask police for background checks that could reveal whether they are at risk of attack or abuse, will be extended nationally within months.

It also gives potential victims a ‘right to know’, which allows police to disclose sensitive information about a partner even if an individual has not asked for it.

The expansion of Clare’s Law nationally comes after a successful 14-month trial in Manchester, Gwent, Wiltshire and Nottingham during which 400 women were given sensitive information such as details of a partner’s criminal record or complaints about them.

History of violence: Clare Wood, left, was murdered by her ex-boyfriend George Appleton after she dumped him. She had no idea of his violent past

The scheme is named after Clare Wood, 36, who was strangled by George Appleton after meeting him on Facebook four years ago.

Appleton was freed by police, who dismissed him as a ‘quiet, mild mannered man’, just 72 hours before he set her body on fire and hanged himself.

Her family later discovered he had convictions for violence against women, including kidnapping at knifepoint.

Clare’s father Michael Brown, who has campaigned for women to receive more protection, yesterday said the law could have saved her life.

Home Secretary Theresa May said 'domestic abuse shatters lives'

‘I’m hoping that at the very least there is going to be a substantial drop in the death figures,’ he added.

‘Clare’s Law is not a panacea, we have never suggested that it will stop all domestic violence.

‘But what it does do is give women and men in that situation a reasonable chance to make an educated assumption about what they should do in the future – go or stay.’

Some 88 women were killed by a  partner or former boyfriend last year, according to the Government, and the rise of dating and social networking websites has left many unaware of their partner’s background.

Under the scheme, which is expected to come into force in March, police could take up to five weeks to disclose records.

Women will be warned that repeating sensitive details to others could be an offence.

In Wiltshire, 118 applications for disclosure were made and 22 granted in the trial. Police also piloted domestic violence protection orders, which ban abusive partners from going near their home for up to 28 days.

Critics including domestic violence charity Refuge have said the initiative could waste police resources. Others said it may lead to malicious claims.

But Home Secretary Theresa May said: ‘Domestic abuse shatters lives – Clare’s Law provides people with the information they need to escape an abusive situation before it ends in tragedy.’
