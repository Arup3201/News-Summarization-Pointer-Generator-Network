While losing weight is the furthest most of us aspire to alter our bodies, one woman has a truly unusual goal; to forcibly elongate her own neck to an unbelievable eight inches.

And Sydney is already more than half way there, already boasting a five-inch neck.

The 29-year-old, from Los Angeles, desperately wants to look like one of the Padaung women of the Kayan tribe from Burma, who wear brass neck coils to elongate their necks.

Sydney is obsessed with lengthening her own neck, and wants it to reach eight inches

Sydney has spent more than $1,000 ( £660) creating her own brass neck ring, held together with special glue

Sydney, who appears on TLC's Strange Addictions to talk about her odd obsession, has spent more than $1,000 (£660) creating her own brass neck ring, which is held together with special glue.

She currently has 16 rings which have stretched her neck by an incredible five inches. 

Her aim is to add several more rings so her neck is stretched to eight inches on its own but will be a full 12 inches - a foot long - while wearing the brass coils.

Sydney admits she has trouble driving and parking because her range of movement is limited and has had to change the way she eats - but she still only takes the coils off twice a year. 

Unsurprisingly it gets rather hot under the brass cage and Sydney is forced to clean under the coils with baby wipes.

Sydney, who refused to be shown on camera without the neck coils, visited a doctor to check it would be safe to add more coils.

Before her obsession began, Sydney was a normal girl with a totally normal length neck 

Everyday task such as cooking, driving an eating, have become a challenge with her solid neck brace 

He advised her against it and while Sydney refuses to take off her existing necklace she agreed to wait five years before adding any more coils. 

However not all bizarre obsessions are a danger to health.

Kevin, 27, from Chicago, who also appears on TLC's My Strange Addiction is addicted to wearing orthopedic casts - even though they are not needed for any broken any bones.

The coils restrict Sydney's range of movement, preventing her from turning her head 

Despite being told be a doctor that adding more rings to her necklace would be dangerous she plans to go ahead, though has agreed to wait five years before stretching anymore 

Unbelievably Sydney only takes the coils off twice a year, and sleeps in them every night 

He has spent more than $50,000 (£33,000) on his weird fetish so far - which sees him usually wear a cast on his arm or leg - although occasionally he does go out with a double arm cast on.

Years of practice means he is able to adeptly put himself in plaster, a feet most doctors would struggle with. 

And despite the inconveniences cause by having a cast - such as not being able to wash properly as they have to remain dry- Kevin says he loves the sensation.

Kevin says being in plaster casts gives him a 'high'

Kevin became obsessed with casts after breaking his arm while roller skating when he was 12. 

Now he wears his casts out in public - and even uses them as a way to chat up women. 

Kevin said: 'It feels amazing. it gives me a high. When I was six or seven I would steal toilet roll and wrap my legs up. 

'My dream date is to take a girl out in a full cast.'
