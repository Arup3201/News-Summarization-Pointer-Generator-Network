Nazi soldiers formed a secret army and plotted to attack the Allies who occupied Germany after the end of the Second World War, according to recently unearthed documents.

A group of 2,000 soldiers from Hitler's Wehrmacht, including senior SS officers, formed the covert group with the aim of restoring 'honour' to their homeland, which had been split into two states and ravaged by fighting.

The group spied on left-wing politicians, stockpiled weapons and planned to recruit 40,000 of its own soldiers to attack opposing forces, including the Soviets occupying East Germany, and the newly-formed republic in West Germany.

Secret: Albert Schnez, (left) who later commanded the official German army, led the secret force. Otto Skorzeny, (right), a decorated SS officer, was also involved

Details of the organisation were revealed in files from Germany's intelligence agency, the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND).

According to the documents, former Nazi officers Albert Schnez led the organisation. He went on to command the Bundeswehr, the modern-day German army.

Otto Skorzeny, the decorated Waffen SS officer who Mussolini the Italian dictator in a daring glider raid on the mountaintop where he was held prisoner by anti-fascists, was also involved in the plans

Plans made by Schnez spelled out how his 40,000 troops would first fight the Russians in East Germany before turning to attack the west of the country.

Attacks: The covert army planned first to attack to Russians occupying badly-damaged East Germany

Defeated soldiers: The secret force was made up of former Wehrmacht and SS fighters. German soldiers are pictured here surrendering at Aachen

Informed: Germany Chancellor Konrad Adenauer was told about the secret group, and ordered intelligence services to monitor them

Plans were drawn up to seize weapons from riot police armories. The group also seemed to have a fixation on tracking down what it termed 'Vaterlandsverr√§rter' - traitors to the Fatherland.

The ex-Nazi officers believed that a civil war could break out at any time in Germany.

According to the newly-discovered file, Germany's then-leader, Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, was told about the secret army in 1951. He told his spies to carry out 'assistance and monitoring' of the group, but did not move to shut it down.
