While his country is reeling from a military coup, the heir to the throne of Thailand is hiding out in a five-star hotel in a quiet village in Hampshire.

Maha Vajiralongkorn, 61, only son to 86-year-old King Bhumibol, arrived at Tylney Hall in Rotherwick a week ago, before the army, in which he holds the rank of general, overthrew the Thai government.

Taking over a wing of the extravagant hotel, where rooms start at £250-a-night, the crown prince has brought an entourage of 'about 30', including several guards and security staff.

Royal stay: Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, 61, only son and heir to the frail 86-year-old King Bhumibol, arrived with an entourage of 30 at Tylney Hall in Hampshire last week

Did he know? Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, a general in the Thai Army that now rules the country, has been staying at the luxury hotel since before the coup

Riding it out: Rooms at the extravagant five-star 18th century hotel starts at £250 per night for the cheapest alternative, and the prince has taken over a whole wing

The prince arrived at the Hampshire luxury hotel with what has been described as ‘hundreds of boxes’ several days before the military took charge of Thailand in a non-violent coup on Thursday.

A marquee has been set up in the gravel car park in front of Tylney Hall in order to provide cover for two top-of-the-range Mercedes, assumed to be belonging to the prince – one has the number plate THAI 1.

‘The Thai prince is staying here, he has about 30 people with him,’ a hotel employee confirmed to the Evening Standard.

‘We have hardly seen them as they have been very private. They are staying for ten days. ‘

Meanwhile, the Thai junta has banned more than 150 prominent political figures from leaving the country, as it attempts to bring order after Thursday’s coup - but one group in particular is unimpressed with their establishment of martial law.

Crackdown: A Thai protester is dragged away by the military during an anti-coup protest  on Friday night under the new rules that no organised gathering can be of more than five people

Force: The protester is dragged on the ground, losing his shoe, in an attempt to break up the protest before the 10pm curfew

The army took power in the volatile 
Southeast Asian nation without firing a single shot after seven months 
of political unrest, the second military coup in eight years.

Martial
 law was quickly imposed, including a nationwide 10pm curfew and, much 
to the dismay of the social media generation, an order for every TV 
channel to broadcast round-the-clock junta announcements and patriotic 
hymns.

TV broadcasts on all 
networks have been replaced by a static screen showing military crests 
and the junta's self-declared name: National Peace and Order Maintaining
 Council - the BBC, CNN and other international TV news networks have 
been blocked.

Patriotic 
music is played on loop, only interrupted by occasional announcements 
from military officials, and the population is not happy.

Following
 the government takeover the new leaders did what all modern figures of 
power and influence to – they set up a Facebook page .

Since
 Thursday, more than 230,000 people have liked the page, and the social 
media savvy Thais are expressing their dismay over the loss of their 
entertainment.

‘Since you're
 reforming politics, you might as well reform your music,’ said one of 
many postings on the page, which has received song requests for 
everything from the soundtrack from Disney’s Frozen to Justin Timberlake
 and more up-beat folk music.

Lotsa likes: The army leaders behind the military coup were quick to set up a Facebook page where they post announcements - and receive a lot of complaints about their taste in music

‘Play other songs, will you! Your marching music is making me so patriotic that I want to wield a sword and slash some Burmese!’ a commenter wrote, in reference to Thailand's historical enemy and neighbour, now known as Myanmar.

Others complained about the TV broadcasts, with parents asking for the return of children's channels: ‘Can I have my TV back? At least the cartoon channel for my kid? It won't hurt national stability,’ said one father.

Thai military staged its second coup in eight years on Thursday, suspending the constitution and the Cabinet.

On Friday it summoned the former prime minster Takshin Shinawatra, who was sacked by the Constitutional Court earlier this month for nepotism, her replacement and more than 100 others to report to ta military compound in central Bangkok.

The military said it was summoning the high-profile figures ‘to keep peace and order and solve the country's problems’, however, CNN correspondent Saima Mohsin, reported that the military had 'summoned foreign diplomats and banned 155 politicians and activists from leaving the country' under threat of arrest.

The new martial law rules, which includes banning gatherings of more than five people and a nationwide curfew between 10pm and 5am, applies to both tourists and Thais and breaking them results in immideate arrest, the military has warned.

For seven months, anti-government protesters have been calling for the removal of the powerful Shinawatra family and its alleged corrupting influence from Thai politics.

Ms Shinawatra and her temporary replacement Niwattumrong Boonsongpaisan, arrived at the army compound in Bangkok by midday Friday, Yingluck's aide confirmed.

After about 30 minutes, Yingluck left the facility and was taken to another army location by soldiers, the aide said.

The international community, including the United States, Japan and Australia expressed concern and disappointment over the coup, with the U.S. saying there was ‘no justification’ for the takeover.

The coup was launched Thursday while the military hosted a meeting of political rivals for what was billed as a second round of talks on how to resolve the country's political deadlock.

After two hours of inconclusive talks, armed soldiers detained the participants, including four Cabinet ministers, and army chief General Prayuth Chan-ocha appeared on national television to announce the takeover.

General Prayuth justified the coup as a necessary move to restore stability and ‘quickly bring the situation back to normal’ amid increasing spasms of violence that together with controversial court rulings had rendered the government powerless and the country profoundly divided between the wealthy urban elite who disdain the Shinawatra family and their supporters among the rural poor majority.

The military suspended the constitution and the Cabinet and banned gatherings of more than five people — a risky bid to end half a year of political upheaval that many fear will only deepen the nation's crisis.

Thursday's dramatic events were the latest response to a societal schism laid bare after the 2006 coup deposed former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the older brother of Yingluck and a billionaire tycoon whose populist movement has won every national election since 2001.

Thaksin lives in self-imposed exile to avoid corruption charges, but he still wields enormous influence over Thailand's political affairs and remains at the heart of the ongoing crisis.

It is a divide that has led to upheaval multiple times in recent years. The latest crisis alone has left 28 people dead and more than 800 wounded since November.
