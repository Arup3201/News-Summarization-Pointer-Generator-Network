He's not exactly known for his pro-democracy views and yet here's North Korean leader Kim Jong-un flashing a victory sign to student activists today on the streets of Hong Kong.

And here he is again - standing in front of a wall with messages of support to protesters currently occupying part of the city's financial Admiralty district.

Except, of course, it's not really Kim but a chap called Howard - a 35-year-old Hong Kong-born Australian musician... and a dead ringer for the dictator.

V for victory, Kim? North Korean dictator lookalike Howard greets pro-democracy supporters on the streets of Hong Kong today. 'I don't really have to do anything to create awareness. Just my presence,' he said

Howard, who charges HK$5,000 (£400) for party appearances, said being a Kim doppelganger can be a funny experience but he also hopes to stir up dialogue about North Korea and its human rights issues.

Howard made his satirical appearances in support of the protesters' movement in the semi-autonomous city.

Last year, he became the world's first professional Kim Jong-Un lookalike and he's endured endless jokes about his double ever since Kim rose to power in 2011.

Howard said: 'My friends and I joked back and forth. Maybe I should get dressed up and do some gigs with it. After all, I'm a musician, so it's about the performance.'

Over time, Howard, who refuses to give his surname in order to keep his music and impersonation careers separate, has perfected his wave and stern smile - and even his recent limp.

Will the real Kim please stand up... in case you're wondering, that's Howard on the left - and the real deal on the right

'The key to becoming Kim is to always look unhappy and dissatisfied. It is his trademark,' said Howard, seen above checking his phone on the metro in Hong Kong

He may be four years older, slightly taller and thinner than Kim - and have bushier eyebrows - but that hasn't stopped Howard, above, drawing crowds

Last year, Howard became the world's first professional Kim Jong-Un lookalike and he's endured endless jokes about his double ever since Kim rose to power in 2011. Above, the real Kim smiles and applauds, as do his subordinates (because if they don't, they'll 'disappear'...)

He may be four years older, slightly taller and thinner than Kim - and have bushier eyebrows - but that hasn't stopped him drawing crowds.

The student leaders in Hong Kong are struggling to maintain momentum after aborting a weekend street referendum intended to shore up support. 

Organisers said they scrapped the vote because they hadn't adequately consulted with the public.

Protesters (below) have been occupying main streets in three neighborhoods across Hong Kong since September 28, when police unleashed tear gas in a failed attempt to disperse thousands of them trying to rally outside government headquarters.

Beijing has decreed that a committee will screen candidates for inaugural 2017 direct elections to choose the semi-autonomous Chinese city's leader, angering many who call it fake democracy. 

Protesters want Hong Kongers to be able to name candidates of their own choosing.

Protesters marked a full month of their movement with an evening rally that began with the unfurling of umbrellas and a moment of silence that lasted 87 seconds - one for every canister of tear gas fired by police. 

'I don't really have to do anything to create awareness. Just my presence,' he said. 

'It brings the issue up in a light-hearted way. It's important to know about this country... If they launch a missile, it could start World War Three.'

Howard added: 'The key to becoming Kim is to always look unhappy and dissatisfied. It is his trademark.

'The reaction whenever I step out in the Mao suit, make-up and hair slicked back is always crazy.

'Sometimes I have to wear a baseball cap and sunglasses to try and avoid the attention when going about my everyday business.'

Howard said he fell into the role almost by accident when a picture of himself posing as the Dear Leader went viral on Facebook in April 2012.

The reaction prompted him to set up a page on the social networking site advertising his body double services - and received a string of requests and offers.

Within weeks, he had appeared in a controversial TV ad for an Israeli burger chain, threatening to nuke America.

Then came more job requests. 

Howard said he was asked to do an ad for a pistachio company with Dennis Rodman, a retired professional basketball player who calls the reclusive North Korean leader his friend, but the plan fell apart when he could not get his US work visa in time. 

Howard added: 'Keeping up with Kim's look is extremely easy and enjoyable. All I have to do is eat and eat and then eat some more.

'It is fun to play him because it freaks people out. They don't expect to see this notorious dictator walking the streets of their city. 

'But it is always nice to go back and just be myself at the end of the day.'

Howard said his family have been supportive of his career path after his years performing in bands and producing music.

He said: 'My friends and family all think it is hilarious that I have the guts to play an evil dictator. In fact they are quite proud of it.'
