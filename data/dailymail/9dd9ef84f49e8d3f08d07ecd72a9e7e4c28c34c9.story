A groom who had a baby and got married on the same day has been spared jail after he glassed a guest at the reception.

Karl and Jasmine Storey got married at Gretna Green, Scotland, in October last year - just hours after the 27-year-old gave birth to their baby boy Anthony.

The family then returned to their hometown of Kielder, Northumberland, for the wedding reception at a local pub where a fight erupted, a court heard.

Newcastle Crown Court was told that the 26-year-old had spotted his brother Dale Storey, 20, being confronted by another guest and intervened by striking a pint glass over the other man.

The guest had been leaving the reception with his daughter, who worked behind the bar but had been drinking after her shift, when he was told that Dale had possibly spiked her drink.

He had returned to confront Dale when the row, which was captured on CCTV, broke out and resulted in the man, who has not been named, being taken to hospital. 

Prosecuting, Emma Dowling said: 'The victim's daughter works at the bar where the reception was taking place.

'She finished her shift and got very drunk very quickly leading to her and her father leaving the bar.

'As they were leaving, the victim heard whispers that Dale Storey had purposely got her very drunk with heavy spirits and potentially spiked her. He returned to the bar to confront him and pushed Dale.

'Karl Storey comes across and strikes him in the face with a pint glass before Dale joins in and gets the victim in a headlock before numerous punches are thrown.

'The victim describes being punched a number of times and had blood running down his face. The males were then split up.'

The guest sustained six or seven small cuts to his eye and was taken to hospital for treatment that night.

Miss Dowling read from the victim impact statement saying the victim was 'disgusted by the attack' and feels he could have been 'blinded'.

At 7.40am that morning, Mrs Storey gave birth to their son before they made the 45-mile round trip to Gretna for the wedding.

They were chauffeured between the hospital, wedding and reception by Karl's other brother, Bryan.

Speaking at the time, Karl said: 'He was as good as gold during the ceremony and it's turned out to be the most amazing day of my life. I can't take it all in.'  

Defending Donald Mcfall said: 'The defendant comes from a stable home, is a very dedicated family man and is a hard working individual. 

'He has four children which requires a great deal of dedication.

'Karl and his brother were simply standing in the reception when Karl saw his brother being attacked and he's then reacted to it.

'The single punch he threw with the glass in hand was not intentional and he did not intend to use it as a weapon.

'He was trying to stop this man from attacking his brother. He regrets his actions and insists there was no bad blood previous and there is none now. He expresses full remorse.'

Kate Barnes, also for the defence, said: 'He has no previous convictions and left school with a number of qualifications. He strongly denies spiking anyone's drink that night.

'It was supposed to be a happy day and on that occasion he had drunk in excess, something he does not normally do.

'He is not unintelligent and has a great deal of insight into what happened that evening. He expresses full remorse for his actions.

'His part in this was to deliver one or two blows which seemingly aren't responsible for any of the victim's injuries.'

Karl Storey was given a suspended sentence at Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) and his brother Dale was also given a similar sentence

Karl Storey pleaded guilty to unlawful wounding and Dale Storey pleaded guilty to common assault.

Ms Recorder Turner, sentenced Karl  to a 12 month suspended sentence, with an 160 unpaid work requirement and a compensation charge of £500.

The judge sentenced Dale to a 12 month community order with an 100 hours unpaid work requirement and a compensation charge of £100.

The judge said: 'The 31st of October should have been a very happy day because it was your wedding day and your wife had given birth to a baby boy.

'You had both enjoyed the wedding and were celebrating that and the new arrival of the baby boy to the family. You both had far too much to drink and this is something you must watch.

'I am not going to send either of you prison today but I still want you to realise this is a very serious matter. 

'I have watched the CCTV and it seems something was troubling the complainant. What followed after that was an attack that lasted quite some time.

'You must understand that you can't keep acting like this and you're lucky that the victim did not have more injuries.

'Ordinarily, it seems you are both decent young men and I believe both of you do not pose a real threat to the public.'

'Let's hope this was just a minor blip in both your lives.'
