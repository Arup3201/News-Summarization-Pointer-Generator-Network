A former police sergeant accused of molesting the children he adopted, has struck a bargain with prosecutors that will allow him to go free from jail in just a year.

Maurice A. Martinez, 46, of Oklahoma City, was a foster father to some 60 children and a city lawman but on Tuesday he pleaded guilty to nine felony counts of sexual abuse against a child.

He was arrested in April 2011, bringing to light a sordid saga of sexual abuse.

Mistrust: Former Oklahoma City police sergeant Maurice Martinez was charged with sexually abusing the children he fostered

In addition to the nine counts of sexual abuse, the ex-police sergeant reportedly pleaded guilty to one count each of attempting to prevent a witness from testifying and possession of child pornography, The Oklahoman newspaper reports.

He could have faced far worse as a judge threw out in August 2011 much of the case prosecutors initially lodged against him.

Over objections from authorities, the judge at that time dismissed 23 of the 35 felony counts filed by authorities.

The judge did so after the Martinez's initial accuser testified in court that he made up the allegations.

He was portrayed by authorities as an abusive man who intimidated witnesses and gamely played the system of which he was once a part.

Martinez's accusers, 'had made it very clear they were uncomfortable testifying and were even recanting some of their prior statements,” Oklahoma County Asst. District Attorney Gayland Gieger reportedly said Tuesday.

'The bottom line is, Mr. Martinez or maybe even some of the other foster kids in the home had pressured or influenced the victims to say nothing had happened to them.'

A police detective previously testified Martinez had threatened his accusers, witnesses, people who reported the accusations to police, state Department of Human Services personnel and even herself, The Oklahoman reports .

With credit for time served, Martinez likely will be out in a year.

Martinez will serve 25 years probation and register as a sex offender. He is also barred from caring for children or working for the law.

He reportedly pleaded guilty to misdemeanor counts of harboring a runaway and conspiracy to obstruct an officer.

Martinez was charged in April 2011 with sexual offenses against four teenage boys who were under his care. He resigned from the police department in July 2011.
