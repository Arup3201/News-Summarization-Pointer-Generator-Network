Labour's flagship economic plan to increase taxes on big business to ease the pressure on the high street could cost 100,000 jobs, David Cameron claimed today.

The Prime Minister said the proposal to hike corporation tax for the first time in 40 years was 'crazy'.

Corporation tax is set to fall from 21p to 20p tomorrow – but Labour have pledged to reverse the cut to help reduce business rates for millions of smaller firms.

Corporation tax is set to fall from 21p to 20p tomorrow – but in a speech today in Swindon Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls pledged to reverse the cut to help reduce business rates for millions of smaller firms

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said he would use the first budget of a Labour government to cut business rates for 1.5 million small companies - worth an average of £400 to each firm – and then freeze them the following year.

Speaking in Swindon on the first full day of the election campaign this morning, Mr Balls said 17 small firms would benefit from the cut for every one large business helped by the Coalition's reduction in corporation tax.

He said: 'It's not right to go ahead with the further cut for larger companies when we can use the money in a better way to help us create more good jobs by backing small companies.'

Mr Balls said the coalition spent £7 billion over the last five years cutting the main rate of corporation tax to the benefit of larger firms while revenues from business rates rose by £3 billion, at an average cost to firms of £1,500-a-year.

Mr Balls added: 'Unleashing the potential of smaller businesses to grow, create more good jobs and raise living standards is a vital part of Labour's better plan.

'This is part of our plan to deliver a simpler and fairer tax system for small businesses. This is the right priority when money is tight. And it will mean that the tax burden on small businesses will be lower with Labour than under the Tories.'

However the move risks re-opening the rift with some big business leaders who have strongly criticised Labour's spending plans.

It comes after some company bosses complained at the way comments they had made expressing concern about the prospect of Britain leaving the EU were included in a Labour advertisement attacking the Conservatives.

Mr Cameron – who this morning set out the Conservative pledge to boost employment by two million over the next five years – told Sky News's Sunrise that Labour's plan to raise corporation tax was 'a crazy thing to do when the economy is growing'.

Tory Treasury minister David Gauke said that abandoning the cut in corporation tax would jeopardise economic security.

He said: 'This would be the first time corporation tax has risen in over 40 years and Labour's plans could cost 96,400 jobs - it would put people's economic security at risk.

'The Conservative Party is helping businesses small and large as part of our long-term economic plan - we don't divide them up for the sake of making a political point.'
