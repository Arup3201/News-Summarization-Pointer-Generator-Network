Brian Lara and Dwight Yorke may be sporting legends of
Trinidad and Tobago but they're clearly quite at home in Barbados.

The former West Indies cricket captain was in the party mood
at the island's Kadooment Day parade, and was seen frolicking with a
scantily-clad reveller.

He was joined by pal and former Manchester United and Aston
Villa striker Dwight Yorke.

Yorke found time to share a joke with carnival girls and
meet a fan painted as a skeleton.

Kadooment Day is the climax of 'Crop Over', a traditional
harvest festival, which dates back on the island to 1688.

It is a national holiday, drawing huge crowds and parades.
