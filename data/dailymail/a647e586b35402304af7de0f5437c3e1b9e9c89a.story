Children's nativity costumes are selling for more than three times their value on eBay as desperate parents struggle to find last minute costumes for nursery and school plays.

Parents are frantically bidding against each other for shepherd, angel, wise men, Mary and Joseph costumes as supermarkets sell out of the dressing-up clothes.

Used and homemade angel costumes are selling for up to an incredible £32 on eBay, whilst king costumes are going for more than £20 and shepherd costumes for up to £22.

George at Asda is selling nativity costumes for £8 - including King, shepherd and sheep - but parents have found sizes sell out fast as time-poor parents buy instead of make their child's school nativity outfits

Many of the outfits have been posted by savvy parents, who have snapped up bargains at supermarkets, such as Asda, Tesco and Sainsbury's, where the costumes cost around £8 each.

A lot of the nativity clothes have now sold out in the supermarket stores or on their websites, so prices are rocketing on eBay.

'We've only just been told that our son is a shepherd in the school play and most of the supermarkets have sold out of his size, so I've had to buy on eBay," said Catherine Wallis, 37, from Cambridge.

'It's very annoying when I could have bought a similar costume for less a third of the price a few weeks ago.'

A spokesman for eBay said sales of nativity costumes had shot up by 102 per cent over the last fortnight on eBay.co.uk.

He said sales of nativity wear were also up 57 per cent compared to this time last year and there were currently 3,000 outfits listed on the site.

'This Christmas we've seen sales of nativity costumes shoot up as savvy parents have been flocking to the site en masse to get their children kitted out,' he said.

A spokesman for Asda said there has been a 40 per cent increase in sales of single tea towels and its multi-buy five pack tea towels, which the supermarket has attributed to mothers making homemade shepherd headdresses.

Harriet Oliver, 40, from Fulham, south west London, said: ‘I spent days trawling the internet looking for a King or Wise Man costume for my son, Rupert, who is six, to wear in his nativity play.

'I looked on every site I could think of but everything had sold out in his size – all I could find was one costume that was £40, which was far too much.

'I was desperate, and my son was horrifed at the prospect of me cobbling something together with my rusty sewing skills, but eventually a friend found him a brilliant costume at Asda.

‘Next year I will start looking earlier, but the schools don’t tend to tell you what part your child has until December anyway, so it’s always a rush.'

Julie Froggatt, 37, from Haringay, north London, said: 'I was given just a few days to make my children's costumes after the school left it until the week of the play to send a letter telling us which part our child had.

'I was keen to make the costumes rather than buy them - ours were always homemade when we were young and I have such fond memories of our wonky outfits - but I didn't even have a weekend to get together fabric and have a go.

'I ended up buying my daughter's outfit, but my son was a shepherd so he got the bed sheet plus tea towel treatment.

'His outfit looked very cute - and exactly the same as the school play shepherds 30 or more years ago when I was in the nativity.'

More than one in ten fathers would only go to their child’s nativity if they landed the part of Mary or Joseph – a new poll has found.

For a hard to please 11 per cent, the only thing that would coax them away from the office would be their child getting the role of Mary or Joseph.

Many of the fathers polled claimed that work commitments were the primary reason they couldn’t find the time to make their child’s Christmas play.

Nevertheless, an overwhelming majority of fathers, 89 per cent, would want to go to their little one’s nativity regardless of what role they were given, found a poll by officebroker.com
