Aspirations: Jordan hopes to one day play in the Premiership. He owes his life to medics at the Freeman hospital in Newcastle after he was born with a hole in the heart

A school-boy born with a hole in his heart has battled back to health to become an aspiring Premiership football star.

Jordan Scott, 11, required surgery on his heart when he was only nine weeks old.

Now thanks to medics at the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle, Jordan is fighting fit and has already been scouted by rivals Newcastle United and Sunderland Football Club.

His father Mark, 34, from Heworth, 
Gateshead, said: 'When Jordan was a few weeks old he was really 
breathless and he used to turn blue.

'He was tiny and didn't seem to be growing.

'We
took him to the doctors but were just told that we shouldn't worry. But
when he was four and half weeks they found that Jordan had a heart 
murmur.'

The salesman and his wife Jayne were told that Jordan needed an immediate operation and that the chances of survival were 50-50.

Mrs Scott, 28 said: 'It was a really worrying time for us. It was heartbreaking to see Jordan go through all of it.

'If it wasn't for the skill of the medics, he wouldn't be here.

'From the nurses to the consultants and the surgeons, they were fantastic.'

Jordan required annual check-ups up until six-years-old when doctors were confident the heart had fully healed.

The football mad youngster - whose favourite player is ex-England star Nicky Butt - is now able to play five times a week.

Last season he netted 54 goals in only 24 games for his Felling Magpies under-11s side, who claimed the title and made the cup final.

He bagged a further 21 goals in 12 games for his second team, Leam Rangers.

Leam Rangers manager Karl Boyd, who named him player of the season, said it was a credit to the youngster how far he had come.

He said: 'I think someone with the natural ability of Jordan has a bright future.'
