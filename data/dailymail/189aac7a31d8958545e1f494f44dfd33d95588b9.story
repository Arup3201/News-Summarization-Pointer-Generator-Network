Another year, another Guinness Pro12 season. Well, not exactly.

The 2014-15 edition of the four-nation competition promises to be the ‘most competitive, interesting and exciting’ yet, according to former Lions, Ireland and Leinster prop Paul Wallace.

With the 2015 World Cup beginning in England next September, potential Irish, Welsh, Scottish and Italian representatives will be keen to showcase their credentials for their clubs and provinces.

Exciting: Sky Sports pundit Paul Wallace expects the Guinness Pro12 season to be 'most competitive' ever

Favourites: Wallace believes his former side Leinster are favourites to win an unprecedented third-straight title

Prediction: Sky Sports rugby pundit Paul Wallace expects an extremely competitive Guinness Pro12 season

Rivalries: Derbies, like Glasgow-Edinburgh, will take on even greater significance in this season says Wallace

Sky Sports have acquired the rights for the Pro12 this season, and their rugby union analyst Wallace is excited to see how the season will unfold - especially with the new European qualifying system.

With the Heineken Cup being replaced with the European Rugby Champions Cup for the 2014-15 season, the best placed team from each country in the Pro12 will qualify outright for the competition, as will the three highest ranked teams not already qualified.

The eighth and ninth placed sides will then compete in a four-team play-off with an English and French side for the remaining European spot.

And speaking ahead of the new season Wallace, capped 45 times by the country of his birth and three times by the British and Irish Lions, said: 'It’s going to be a long season going all the way through to the World Cup but certainly there is more excitement going into the Pro12 than in previous season. I think it can be the most competitive, interesting and exciting ever.

'It should get off to a cracking start with Glasgow-Leinster as that’s always a big one. A lot of the national players aren’t available but with the pressures of qualification for the European Cup it will be quite interesting to see how much the frontline players are pushed out early on in the season in particular.'

Ian Madigan (Leinster) - The 25-year-old fly-half or centre 'excelled in last season's final and he can replace Brian O'Driscoll as the focal point of the Leinster side'.

Time to shine: Ian Madigan starred for Leinster in last season's Pro12 final and can improve this year too

Mils Muliaina (Connacht) - The 34-year-old New Zealand World Cup-winning full-back will 'really help Connacht out and allow them to continue to become real challengers'.

Pedigree: New Zealand World Cup-winner Mils Muliaina gives Connacht some much-needed experience

Gareth Anscombe (Cardiff Blues) - The 23-year-old former Waikato Chiefs fly-half will be a 'big player for Cardiff - he is young, ambitious and talented with Super Rugby experience and he has the potential to be a truly outstanding player'.

Outstanding: Gareth Anscombe is a young and exciting back who can thrive at Cardiff Blues this season

New format: Ex-Ireland prop Wallace (centre) thinks European qualification will make the league more exciting

Former Saracens prop Wallace believes every single match now takes on a huge significance, with a solitary point potentially the difference between qualification for Europe's premier competition or not.

'Derbies in Italy and Scotland are going to be huge now as it could be the difference between whether you get European qualification or not,' he continued. 'It’s very important they do get those top spaces, from a financial point of view. The distance Edinburgh are behind Glasgow on the pitch makes it a very tough season for them in particular.

'All sides like Connacht and the (Newport Gwent) Dragons will be targeting that fifth position because then you will be pretty much guaranteed a European spot.

'A lot goes down to the Welsh regions. In the past I have felt they have been happy with mid-table respectability but it puts pressure on them and the Irish sides because you cannot just sit on your hands anymore.

'Cardiff Blues, meanwhile, seem to have a new renewed ambition after the club versus country row was solved in Wales and I expect them to go well this year. There isn't much between the Welsh sides with the Dragons improving and the Ospreys weakening somewhat, so it will be fascinating to see.'

Big miss: Leinster and Ireland legend Brian O'Driscoll has retired but Wallace expects his old side to compete

Gone: Leinster have also lost the experience of Leo Cullen but Wallace thinks they have what it takes again

Strong: Ulster have made great progress recently and Wallace thinks they have the power to challenge again

Despite the retirement of Irish stalwarts Brian O'Driscoll and Leo Cullen, Wallace is still tipping his old side to claim an unprecedented third title in a row.

He expects Leinster's main challengers to come for Ireland too, but thinks Glasgow and Cardiff could throw up a potential surprise.

Wallace said: 'I think Leinster are looking very strong again. Obviously the leadership of O’Driscoll and Cullen will be missed but they have some big players like Sean O’Brien. They’re still the favourites for me.

'Ulster will be up there, as will Munster. Munster are difficult ones as there is a massive change going on behind the scenes. Glasgow as they showed last few season are a very, very consistent side.

'From the Welsh sides, I think Cardiff are looking good, particularly with the signing of Adam Jones. They have lacked consistency but they now have Reece, Gethin Jenkins and Jones. This is the year they might start becoming a contender again.'
