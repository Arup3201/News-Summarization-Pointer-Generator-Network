At first glance, it looked like a collection of dried leaves.

But when photographer Nordin Seruyan moved a little closer, this orange bundle suddenly sprang into life - hundreds of lives in fact.

These tiny larvae are praying mantis pictured only a minute after hatching.

The insects' first priority was to avoid being eaten by predators, but within a few months they will grow into formidable hunters themselves.

Measuring up to 12 inches long, adult mantis are capable of taking down flies, moths and crickets.

Sighting: Photographer Nordin Seruyan spotted the insects on land near his home in the lush tropical forests of Seruyan, central Borneo

Mr Seruyan, 37, a macro photographer, spotted the insects on land near his home in the lush tropical forests of Seruyan, central Borneo.

The father of two said: 'At first I thought it was a collection of dried leaves.

'They were stacked in one egg and it contained hundreds of larvae.

'When I shot them they went one by one from the herd.

'They then go to continue their lives alone and do not return to the nest.'

The praying mantis - so called because of the shape of its prominent front legs which are held in a prayer-like position - is an ambush predator.

Using camouflage to hide among leaves and twigs, the insects can turn their heads 180 degrees to spot prey before striking with reflexes so quick they are difficult to see with the naked eye.

As well as devouring flies and grasshoppers, many praying mantis are also cannibals - and some females even eat males after mating.

Mr Seruyan, who has been photographing insects for four years, said it was the first time he had ever seen their birth.

He said: 'I have been looking for similar images online but I have never seen one like it.

'I think I could be the first man to capture this moment.'
