Boris Johnson's latest attempt to present himself as a global statesman hit a glitch today as a walkabout in Boston left him knee-deep in snow.

The London Mayor already faces a chilly reception when he returns to the UK, amid claims he is neglecting the capital while using international trips to boost his foreign affairs credentials ahead of a potential bid to become Tory leader.

But his six-day visit to the US has coincided with an extreme cold snap hitting the country's eastern seaboard, with almost five feet of snow being dumped on Boston in just over two weeks.

London Mayor Boris Johnson toured the streets of Boston in a London Underground hat as he faced criticism for his international globetrotting

Despite being well-warned of the dire weather, Mr Johnson was pictured tramping around in smart black leather work shoes with not a wellington boot in sight

Forecasters warn that the four-day storm that has sat over the region is set to intensify. The morning commute for many was hellish while schools were closed and flights cancelled.

In the middle of it all, Mr Johnson was trying to promote the idea of building roads underground 3,000 miles away in London, where temperatures are much milder at 9C.

Despite being well-warned of the dire weather, Mr Johnson was pictured tramping around in smart black leather work shoes with not a wellington boot in sight.

To keep his head warm, and his famous blonde hair covered, he had at least remembered to pack a London Underground wooly hat.

Mr Johnson, who is hoping to return to parliament at the general election, has insisted his visits are to promote London.

In his second trip across the pond in three months, he will this week hold talks with Hillary Clinton in New York City, as well as visiting Harvard University in Boston and a Congressional reception in Washington DC.

After braving sub-zero temperatures for a walkabout in the snow, Mr Johnson announced plans to run more of London's roads through tunnels to improve air quality and free up land.

FEB 2015 – Boston, New York City and Washington DC, USA – six-day east coast tour

Parts of the A13, A3, A316, A4 and A406 could be diverted underground, he said.

Mr Johnson told LBC: 'Because of the huge growth of white vans as a result of internet shopping, congestion on our roads with the growth we've got is going to get worse and worse unless we put in mitigating measures.

'We're going to do a lot. We're working to get lorries off the roads at the peak, we're doing all sorts of things to manage the traffic, but in the end, you've got to start thinking laterally and thinking bigger.'

He tried to win over the locals by taking a trip on the T underground line. But after chatting with passengers the journey had to be abandoned when services were cancelled, and Mr Johnson headed outside in search of a bus. 

The visit to the US comes two weeks after a trip to Kurdistan – where he was pictured with an AK-47 while meeting British troops training local fighters in the war against the Islamic State (IS) - and trips to the Far East and USA last November.

He also made high-profile international visits to China and India earlier in his mayoralty.

Labour claimed the Conservative mayor, who is not standing for re-election when his term as mayor ends in 2016, has 'mentally checked out' of City Hall, while Green Party peer Jenny Jones, who is also an Assembly Member, said other people were being left to run the city.

'I feel he is lining himself up to be a global statesman when what we need is a London mayor on the case,' Baroness Jones said.

Christian Wolmar, who wants to be Labour's mayoral candidate, said Mr Johnson had become a 'part-time mayor'.

As well as campaigning in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, where he is standing to become MP, Mr Johnson carried out 95 party political visits in 10 months last year, including campaigning for Conservative candidates in Bath, Swindon and Staffordshire.

Labour has called for Mr Johnson, who is paid a salary of £143,911 to reimburse London taxpayers for the days he is absent from the city during the general election campaign.

Mr Johnson, who has dual US and UK nationality as he was born in New York, began his visit with a speech in Boston on how innovation can help the poor.

On the first day of his trip, the Mayor announced plans to run more roads underground in London, more than 3,000 miles away

The message was interpreted as Mr Johnson positioning himself as a 'one nation' candidate for the Tory leadership when David Cameron steps down.

He will meet former US secretary of state Mrs Clinton on Wednesday to discuss terrorism and the war in Syria and Iraq against the Islamic State.

Mr Johnson will also hold meetings with Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, his predecessor Michael Bloomberg, as well as the British stars of Broadway and New York fashion week.

In November, Mr Johnson conducted a tour of television studios in New York promoting his book on Winston Churchill.

The Mayor's official spokesman dismissed the criticism, insisting overseas visits were often at the invitation of Governments or city leaders.

'Each trip is focused on driving investment for London and for British business and have delivered substantial results for London and for UK plc,' the spokesman said.

'The U.S. trip will focus on tech, life science, policing, higher education, Foreign Direct Investment, city to city co-operation, business engagement and investment, theatre, film, culture and tourism.

'The Mayor will be accompanied by senior leaders in tech and life science and a variety of SMEs in the sector seeking new business in the United States.

'Their association with the Mayor's export programme opened new opportunities in the Far East recently and we hope to do the same here.'
