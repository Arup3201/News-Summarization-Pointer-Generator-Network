The family of the six-year-old Oregon boy forced into eating his lunch behind a screen because his parents dropped him off one minute late to school have been gifted a brand new minivan.

Hunter Cmelo's parents, Nicole Garloff and Mark Cmelo were presented with the $30,000 Chrysler minivan after local Medford businesses heard he was late because their car was old and unreliable.

The photograph which was taken by his mother and posted to Facebook by his grandmother attracted global attention and shamed the school to change its policy on publicly punishing students in the same way.

The family of the six-year-old Oregon boy forced into eating his lunch behind a screen because his parents dropped him off one minute late to school have been gifted a brand new minivan (pictured). Hunter Cmelo's parents, Nicole Garloff and Mark Cmelo were presented with the $30,000 Chrysler minivan

Even though Nicole and Mark's broken-down Dodge Durango was repaired by a friendly local mechanic, a local reposession firm, Rapid Repo and Collections, donated the minivan to them to make sure Hunter would always get to school on time.

"When I handed dad Mark the key to the minivan, he was speechless and extremely grateful,' said McClease Kelly, who organized the generous donation.

Last month, Hunter's picture was shared around the Internet as Nicole and Mark shared their outrage at their son's treatment.

Lincoln Elementary School in Grants Pass was forced to change its tardiness policy after the image of the punishment was shared thousands of times on Facebook - sparking hundreds of complaints.

Alone: Six-year-old Hunter Cmelo was forced to eat alone behind this cardboard divider after his parents dropped him off late to his elementary school. He was left feeling humiliated, his family said

Embarrassed: The school district said that the system is supposed to give children the chance to catch up on work they have missed by being late - but staff have now agreed to stop using the screen

In the photograph, Hunter Cmelo, a first grader at the school, can be seen sitting alone behind a cardboard divider at a cafeteria table. Close by is a cup with a large letter 'D' for 'detention'.

His grandmother, Laura Hoover, shared the image to her Facebook page last Wednesday.

'This is my grandson, Hunter. He's a little first grader,' she wrote. 'His momma's car sometimes doesn't like to start right up. Sometimes he's a couple of minutes late to school.

'Yesterday, he was 1 minute late and this is what his momma discovered they do to punish him! They have done this to him 6 times for something that is out of his control! They make a mockery of him in front of the other students.'

She said that his mother found Hunter crying and took him home. His parents said they were devastated when they found out what their son was going through.

'They are shaming him for something that's not in his control,' his father, Mark Cmelo, told KOIN6. 'It is our fault that he is late.'

Hunter is pictured with his mother, Nicole Garloff, who admitted he is often late to school due to car troubles and because she suffers from osteoporosis, which makes it hard for her to get going in the morning

School: The principal of Lincoln Elementary School in Grants Pass, Oregon has now met with the boy's parents and reached 'an appropriate resolution', the district said

His mother, Nicole Garloff, said the punishment has left her son anxious about going to school, and that a few days ago, he began 'flipping out' because they were running late.

She said that she has experienced car troubles and suffers from osteoporosis, which can set her back in the mornings.

'It causes a lot of pain and in the mornings it's especially hard for me to get going,' she said.

The boy is unable to ride the school bus because they live within a mile of the school, but they are unable to walk because the road is too busy.

School superintendent John Higgins and principal Missy Fitzsimmons started receiving threatening calls after the photo was shared on Facebook, according to Newswatch 12.

Higgins told the channel he believes the system gave students a chance to catch up on missed work.

The 'protocol was communicated to parents via newsletter and is intended to provide the students with an above average level of tardiness, supervised additional learning time in a non-distracting setting,' the district said in a statement. 'It was never intended to isolate or stigmatize students.'

The principal immediately reached out to the parents after receiving complaints. They met on Thursday and agreed to stop using the partition as a punishment.

'We are pleased to report the meeting was productive,' the district said. 'The parents' concerns were politely discussed and, ultimately, the issues were resolved to the satisfaction of both parents and the school. All parties involved believe that an appropriate resolution has been reached.
