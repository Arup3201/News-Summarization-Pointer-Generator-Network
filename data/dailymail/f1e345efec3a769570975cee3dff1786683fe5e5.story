'We were your worst weekend'. So says John Fashanu in Adam Darke's latest documentary for BT Sport Films, The Crazy Gang, which debuts on the channel on Boxing Day. 

Well, for some of us with long memories who didn't mind seeing the mighty fall every now and then, one particular weekend in May 1988 was actually not too shabby at all. 

Mind you, neither was it particularly pretty, nor actually all that romantic, either. The story of The Crazy Gang in a nutshell, in fact.

What it was, was all about the means to an end in the game when Wimbledon pulled off their giant-killing act against the mighty Liverpool. 

What The Crazy Gang does is to tell the story of the 10 years that got them there. But unlike the legendary music hall act from which they adopted their name, it proves it wasn't just a bundle of laughs and knockabout japes, all the way.

The Crazy Gang is a film that works very much as a three act play. It starts off by telling of how the division-jumping Wimbledon came to be. The one where, as then manager and catalyst Dave 'Harry' Bassett remembers it, they used to 'nick the cones off the A3' to use on the practise ground. 

And it ends with their Wembley triumph, and John Motson really hitting the nail on the head on commentary when he observed 'it's a one-off club this, I can tell you'.

The Crazy Gang way may have been unorthodox, but it brought the group together as a formidable whole

But the middle part of the story takes it down a notch, becomes more considered, and lets us peer just a little uncomfortably into the dark side of what made Wimbledon tick. 

It is a fascinating shift in gear, and one that needed to be taken as starkly as it was, so as to help give us the complete picture. 

Nevertheless, in spite of the negative elements, when it got down to it, there was still only one conclusion that everybody concerned seemed to come to in the documentary - that it was their way, The Crazy Gang way, or the highway. Or probably more's the point, the aforementioned cone-free A3. 

Of course, the whole rationale behind what made The Crazy Gang tick was how that disparate bunch of individuals became the formidable whole. 

And it is those individual personalities that come shining through in this film. There may be less hair and more waistline with many of them. But that devilment is still very much twinkling away in the eyes.

Plenty of the ex-players who contribute in the documentary have the openness and wit to articulate the thoughts and feelings of the team so well, you may feel you want to question their integrity, but you could never be critical of their honesty. 

Wally Downes, Andy Thorn, Terry Gibson, Dennis Wise, Dave Beasant, Laurie Sanchez et al... all of them are sharp, smart and insightful in their telling of the Wimbledon story. And clearly the kind of men that had more about them than the reputation that preceded them suggested. 

John Scales is another sharp tack. But it is he who resets the tone for the middle part of the story, which coincided with Harry Bassett leaving for Watford and Bobby Gould and Don Howe coming in and setting them on course for Wembley. 

Scales was one of those men drafted in to pep up the side, but spent a lot of his initial time there trying to exorcise the demons that this pressure cooker of a club created.

Terry Phelan, too, speaks well at this point about how he felt he had given up on his football dream. 

Central to creating the atmosphere that made this post-Bassett Wimbledon tick was Vinnie Jones and John Fashanu, although Jones, resplendent for his interview in his country squire attire, defers to the powerful ex-centre forward as being the actual top man. 

He was 'the self-acclaimed leader...you listen to Fash' was how Vinnie puts it. And Fashanu himself is clearly quite happy to accept that accolade. 

He is also very pleased to acknowledge the word 'fear' as being central to his control of the dressing room. And concur that with it came the associated violence.

This is not a pretty part of the film to watch, as he clearly revels in those former glories. But Fashanu is his own man, and again clearly smart and self-aware with it. 

When speaking of his nemesis at the club, Laurie Sanchez - 'any interesting character' is as far as Sanchez was prepared to go, after a long pause, in describing Fash - he says 'I thought I had some chips on my shoulder!'. 

Clearly John knows all about the well from which he draws. This psychodrama finally gives way to the Cinderella story, though. And to a man, even those who doubted themselves at the start of their time at Wimbledon, point out that they left with a sense of joy and achievement that only coming together as a team and overcoming apparently insurmountable odds can engender. 

The underlying sense of violence is never too far away in the film but the Cinderella story eventually emerges

If it wasn't certain at the time just how unique that Wembley win would prove to be ('can't happen again. Be impossible', says Wally Downes at the end of the film), Sam Haman quickly made sure it would be by offloading nearly the entire team.

In doing so, of course, sparked off an array of impressive individual careers in the process, and brought to an end to that particular chapter of the Wimbledon story. A story that, as this beautifully pitched documentary points out, isn't quite as route one as their football used to be.
