Lying in crumpled heaps, severed body parts strewn nearby, this is the terrible toll of the ivory trade on a once-thriving herd of elephants.

Thirty-five carcasses of the majestic gentle giants were found mutilated in a single attack by poachers at a popular safari destination in Cameroon.

The heart-breaking sight was captured by a photographer last month - 20 years after the global ivory trade was officially banned to protect Africa's herds.

In the aftermath of the slaughter at Bouba N'djida National Park, a terrified young elephant was seen cowering around his mother's corpse – the only living elephant the photographer saw in the park for a whole week.

Disgusting: This poor animal's trunk has been removed and discarded once its ivory has been taken

Local activists say 400 elephants may 
have been killed in this park alone since the beginning of the year – 
almost its total population according to the World Wildlife Fund.

This region of the country did contain
Africa's largest population of savannah elephants. There are thought to
be less than 5,000 elephants left in the whole country.

Cameroon is one of a number of African
countries whose elephants are at risk of extinction due to a spike in 
organised gangs of poachers targeting them for their tusks.

Hacked apart with most of their faces 
missing, they took chainsaws to the animals heads to reach the valuable 
ivory which sells for up to £10,000 for a large tusk – leaving a severed
trunk nearby.

Poachers are often poor locals, but in
this case they were a horseback-riding gang carrying machine guns, 
thought to have travelled 1,000 miles from Sudan across Central Africa 
and Chad to reach this site.

Photographer Jean-Francois Lagrot, who
works for a local NGO fighting wildlife crime, captured these scenes in
early March, at great personal risk after the site was sealed off by 
soldiers.

While Cameroon authorities are now 
trying to police the park, campaigners fear it may be too little too 
late to save the once-numerous herds.

He said: 'There is a spike in poaching
all over Africa, it is terrible at the moment. These are the sort of 
poachers you do not mess with. They are on horseback and have weapons.

'They bribe local villagers with the 
elephant meat so they don't tell the authorities and the result is more 
and more slaughtering of elephants.

'Journalists were kept away from the 
slaughter and they did not allow a census of all the dead elephants 
because of the negative image for Cameroon.'

In his view, backed up by the World 
Wildlife Fund which works in the country, the reason for the spike is 
clear – relentless demand for ivory from the Far East and particularly 
China.

With its peoples' rising personal 
wealth and a taste for intricately-carved ivory jewellery and crockery, 
hundreds of tonnes is making its way to their shores.

Mr Lagrot said elite army units were 
sent to the Park to secure the protected area and push the poachers out,
but while they made them take flight, none were caught and one the army
drivers was said to have been shot.

He said: 'Witnesses heard 63 shots 
from the camp during six long minutes of shooting. There were 35 dead at
this site, and another 10 elephants a couple of kilometres away. They 
packed the tusks in maize bags.  

'They didn't catch them and the 
horsemen were seen riding North towards Waza National Park [nearby] and 
asking villagers about the corridor for elephants.'

A Panorama investigation screened last
night found the global trade in ivory is at its worst since records 
after the 1989 ban, with incidents of elephant slaughter also on the 
rise in Kenya, Tanzania and Congo.

Hauls of elephant tusks found at ports
in Africa and Asia reached 24 tonnes last year, double the figure for 
2010. The seizures equate to around 2,500 dead elephants in 2011 alone –
and that's only the ones they found.

In Samburu in northern Kenya, where 
numbers of elephants have plummeted by a quarter in three years, camera 
crews were shown the carcass of a dead female elephant who was pregnant,
and the remains of her unborn calf.

Reporters in Hong Kong found ivory 
being carved by craftsmen and much of it sold without the official 
paperwork required to show it has been legally sourced.

Many critics blame CITES the 
international treaty which banned the global ivory trade, for a recent 
decision to allow African countries to sell stockpiled of ivory they had
seized which may have driven up demand.

Dr. Allard Blom, managing director of 
WWF's Congo Basin program said the situation in Cameroon was 'the worst 
poaching massacre that I can recall in the decades we have worked to 
save elephants in Africa'.

'Poaching is escalating because of a 
growing demand for ivory from Asia and if we fail to take immediate 
action in the face of such plunder, then much of Africa's elephants 
could disappear forever to satisfy human greed', he said.
