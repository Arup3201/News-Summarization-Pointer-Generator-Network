AC Milan have asked about taking Fernando Torres on loan from Chelsea.

The Spanish striker was left out of Saturday's squad to face Leicester City and has also been the subject of enquiries from Roma.

Milan, who have also asked about a loan for Chelsea's young Dutch midfielder Marco van Ginkel, have drawn up a shortlist of targets to replace Mario Balotelli.

Italy-bound? AC Milan and Roma have both enquired about the availability of Chelsea's Fernando Torres on loan

Left out: Torres was not included in Chelsea's matchday squad for the match with Leicester City on Saturday

On his way: AC Milan need to replace forward Mario Balotelli, who is close to a £16million move to Liverpool

Interest: Milan would also like to sign Chelsea's young Dutch midfielder Marco van Ginkel on loan this window

The Italian is close to completing a £16million move to Liverpool. 

Porto's Jackson Martinez is the main objective, however.

Manchester United's Javier Hernandez and Torres are both alternative targets should they fail in their pursuit of Martinez.

Top target: Milan ideally would like to replace Balotelli with Porto striker Jackson Martinez this summer

Alternative: AC Milan could try and lure Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez to Italy as well
