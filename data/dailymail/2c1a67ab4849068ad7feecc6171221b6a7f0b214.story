Lurking in the streets of central New Delhi are a group of men who are being paid good money to do nothing more than just ape about... literally.

With their faces painted grey and white, they have adopted the antics of the langur species of monkey in order to scare away their pesky macaque cousins which break into houses, steal food and scare the living daylights out of residents.

So the New Delhi Municipal Council has decided to turn the tables and put the frighteners into the cheeky raiders by setting the more ferocious langur monkeys onto them - even if they are only men in disguise.

The plan appears to be working well.

According to the Times of India, the men - who not only disguise themselves as langurs but have also learned to shriek like them - leap out from behind bushes and trees and give their simian cousins the fright of their lives, sending them scurrying out of town.

The human-into-monkey trick - reversing man's evolution - has developed from an earlier practice of patrolling Delhi's streets with real langurs that walked on leads with their trainers, particularly through the city's posh neighbourhoods.

But then the Indian government passed a law preventing langurs from being keep in captivity - and back came the bandit macaques to take up the pilfering where they had left off.

Soon the New Delhi Municipal Corporation became flooded with complaints and with professional monkey catchers and their langur side-kicks moving off 'we couldn't find people who knew the tactics to scare the monkeys,' said a corporation employee.

Then came the idea of getting people to pose as langurs - and there was a ready team to do that.

Pramod Kumar, a monkey impersonator, rustled up a number of his friends and soon there were 40 of them ready to paint their faces, stick some fur onto their arms and legs, and start screeching at the macaque invaders.

'I'll growl at them or chase them with a stick,' he says.

Time will tell just how effective the monkey men are, but early results are said to be promising.

A senior official at the council said the practice was the only available option since the ban on keeping trained langurs came into effect.

'These young men have trained themselves to pose as langurs,' he said. 'We have no option but to hire them because, as per law, even an officer who calls for a langur and its master to drive away monkeys can be booked and jailed,' he said.
