A businessman and his son have been charged with manslaughter over the death of a teenage apprentice on their factory floor.

Cameron Minshull, 16, suffered fatal head injuries after he became entangled in an industrial metal lathe in January last year, just weeks into his new job at a factory in Bury, Greater Manchester.

Zaffar Hussain, 59 and son Akbar, 35, have personally been charged with unlawful killing by gross negligence, and their company, Huntley Mount Engineering Ltd, has been charged with corporate manslaughter.

Cameron, who had just started work at the factory on December 3, 2012, was airlifted to nearby Wythenshawe Hospital, but was pronounced dead shortly after his arrival.

Mr Hussain Sr., director of Huntley Mount, and his son, a supervisor of the company, were ordered to face trial by judge and jury at Bury Magistrates court on Tuesday.

Huntley Mount Engineering Ltd is charged with corporate manslaughter by failing to maintain a lathe in a safe condition which amounts to a gross breach of duty of care. It is also accused of failing to ensure the health, safety and welfare of employees.

Prosecuting Miss Elizabeth Reid said: 'These matters arise out of the death of a 16-year-old apprentice at a premises ran by the two men. 

'Hussain Sr. is the sole director and the second defendant is a supervisor at the company which had a very small workforce at the time of the death.

Tragedy: Cameron Minshull, 16, suffered fatal head injuries after he became entangled in an industrial metal lathe in January, 2013, just over a month after he started working at Huntley Mount Engineering Ltd, in Bury

Scene: Zaffar Engineering, located on the former site of Huntley Mount Engineering Ltd in Bury, where Cameron Minshull was working as an apprentice when the accident took place

'The company is charged with corporate manslaughter and the two defendants are charged with manslaughter by gross negligence. 

'The company is facing offences under the health and safety at work act of failing to ensure the safety of an employee. These are matters which can only be dealt with at the crown court.

Cameron, the oldest of four siblings, had recently left Castlebrook and Radcliffe Riverside high schools in Bury.

At the time of the tragedy his devastated family said his death would leave 'a big hole in many people's hearts'.

Charged: Akbar Hussain and his father Zaffar have been charged with unlawful killing by gross negligence, and their company charged with corporate manslaughter, and will appear in crown court later this month

His mother Joanne Hill said: 'We have lost a very precious part of our lives and there are no words to describe how we are feeling.

'Cameron was a much-loved son, brother, nephew, grandson and great-grandson and a friend to many. He will leave a big hole in many people's hearts.'

Lime People Training Solutions Ltd., which place apprentices with employers and had organised Cameron's placement with the Hussains, had been summonsed for failing to ensure the health and safety of a person other than an employee.

However, no representative for the company turned up for the hearing.

The charges follow an investigation by Greater Manchester Police and the Health and Safety Executive.

The Hussains were granted bail pending a preliminary hearing at Manchester Crown Court on November 12.
