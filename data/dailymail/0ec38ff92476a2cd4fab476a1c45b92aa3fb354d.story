The Cardiff hierarchy are aware of the 44-year-old's interest in the role, but it remains to be seen whether the club view the Turk as a viable option.

Dundee manager Paul Hartley is understood to be the front-runner for the job, while Tony Pulis and MK Dons boss Karl Robinson are also said to be in the running.

Tugay was Galatasaray's assistant manager, serving under Gheorghe Hagi and Roberto Mancini, between 2010 and 2014 but left the club this summer following the departure of the Italian.
