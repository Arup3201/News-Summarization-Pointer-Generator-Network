Stewart Downing will return to West Ham more determined than ever to maintain the form which earned a surprise England recall.

Downing is not deterred by Roy Hodgson's decision to take him off at half-time in the 3-1 win in Scotland after 45 minutes when he worked hard but struggled to get on the ball or impose his creative quality.

He knows there will be critics who are quick to write off his chances of adding to his 35 caps but he has four months to persuade Hodgson with his performances for West Ham before the next England squad is selected for games against Lithuania and Italy.

Stewart Downing is determined to keep his place in Roy Hodgson's England squad

Hodgson gives instructions to Downing and his England team-mate during a training session last week

Downing said: 'It is all about people’s opinions. As long as I am picked and playing then I am happy. That is enough for me. Everyone has an opinion in the world of football. Of those picked last night (Wednesday) some will think he should be in or it should be him and so on. That is just the way people talk but I am happy to be back in the squad and just have to stay there now.

'It was good to be out there and play some minutes and good to be back.

'Now it's the same for everyone. You need to keep playing well to be picked. That’s what the manager said to the players after the game. Carry on your form to be picked so I’ll go back to West Ham and try to carry on playing the way I have been playing and hopefully that will be enough to be in the next squad.'

Downing's England return - it was his first cap for two and a half years - was not helped by injury. He took a knock on a knee last week and aggravated the problem during the warm-up ahead of the Slovenia game on Saturday. Although he remained on the team sheet among the substitutes at Wembley he was not fit to come on.

The 30-year-old winger has been in brilliant form for West Ham so far this season 

He was passed a fitness test in Scotland but was probably less than 100 per cent.

Downing said: 'I had not trained all week but was passed fit to play and was just happy to get out there and play 45 minutes. I came through it and should be ok for this weekend’s game for West Ham.

'There’s a bit of swelling on the knee but it’s just a bang. I was fit to play and I was fine.'

Hodgson deployed Downing on the left of a midfield trio, but much of his impressive form for West Ham has come in the No.10 role. His versatility can work against as well as for him.

'It would be nice to nail a position down but the way we have been playing at West Ham, it has suited me to play in that No. 10 role. I can play in the left of the three too. With the players we have with England, obviously it is going to be difficult playing at No. 10 if I am honest.

'Wayne Rooney, Raheem Sterling and Ross Barkley can play there - so you’ll probably see me playing more on the left of the three. That’s where I think I will get the chance to play the most.

'I think we have got good flexibility. We were trying to get into the back of the Scotland midfield really. It was difficult because obviously they were pressing hard us at times. But the first goal settled us and the quality shone through with the goals we scored.

'It is nice to go away with a good win. A lot of people had us down to lose this game after Scotland won last week. That was a big motivation factor for us. To win the game. The first goal was crucial because it settled us down and I think we played some nice football.

Downing made his first start for England in two-and-a-half years and was hooked after 45 minutes

'The team took a lot of stick from the World Cup but have bounced back very well.'

From a personal perspective, the 30-year-old was simply glad to be back in an England shirt, nearly a decade after his debut.

Downing said: 'I have been out of the squad for a long time, two and a half years. I did not think I would be picked again but it’s just so nice to be back in it. Not many players are picked after such a gap. 

'But it just goes to show that if you keep playing well, there is always the chance of being recalled. You’ve just got to play well for your club and you never know.'
