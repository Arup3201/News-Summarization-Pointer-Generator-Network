Legendary quarterback Dan Marino was all smiles as he headed back to work after revelations that he fathered a secret lovechild with a junior network employee and paid her millions of dollars to keep it quiet.

The former Miami Dolphins star looked at ease as he taped CBS's Super Bowl segments in New Orleans on Thursday after the network confirmed he will still be featured in the coverage on Sunday.

'Dan has said all there is to say on this matter, 
and will be in his usual role on our broadcast Super Bowl Sunday,' CBS said in a statement on Thursday.

Reports emerged today that the Hall of Famer, who has long been regarded as a family man, cheated on his wife of 28 years, Claire,  with Donna Savattere, a production assistant at CBS Sports.

Their daughter Chloe was born in June 
2005, and is now being raised by Ms Savattere and her husband, whom she 
met after her relationship with Marino, the  New York Post first reported.

Mr
Marino, 51, admitted to the affair, saying in a statement: 'This is a 
personal and private matter. I take full responsibility both personally 
and financially for my actions now as I did then.

'We mutually agreed to keep our arrangement private to protect all parties involved.'

He
insisted that he and his wife - who celebrated their 28 year wedding 
anniversary on Wednesday - are still together and 'continue to be a 
strong and loving family'.

His wife is believed to have been 
staying at their $5 million waterfront home in Fort Lauderdale as news 
of her husband's affair and love child broke on Thursday morning.

Marino met his mistress while 
carrying out his role as a pregame analyst for CBS, where he has worked 
since 2003. Ms Savattere was 35 at the time of their relationship.

After
Chloe was born, Mr Marino allegedly paid her millions of dollars to 
ensure her silence and take care of their daughter, the 
Post reported.

While the amount Marino paid her has not
been disclosed, she moved to New York and spent her time in the Upper 
West Side and the Hamptons, where she became a fixture on the social 
scene.

Dan Marino is one of the most prolific 
quarterbacks in American football league history, holding or having held
almost every major NFL passing record.

He was picked in the first round of 
the 1983 draft by the Los Angeles Express, but chose to sign with the 
Miami Dolphins, and stayed with the team for the entirety of his career.

He was best known for his quick 
release and powerful arm and leading the Dolphins to the playoffs ten 
times in his seventeen-season career.

Although he was never part of a Super
Bowl-winning team, he is considered one of the greatest quarterbacks in
American football.

He was inducted into the Hall of 
Fame in 2005.

Since retiring before the 2000 season, he has appeared in numerous ad campaigns and joined CBS in 2003 as an in-studio analyst.

The birth also came two months before
Marino was inducted into the Hall of Fame.

At the ceremony, after he 
was introduced by his eldest son Daniel, Marino praised his family for 
their support.

'To Claire and the kids, you guys are my true Hall of Famers,' he said. 'You guys are my whole life. You mean everything to me.'

Savattere has
since married banker Nahill Younis, whom she met on a trip to the 
Bahamas. The couple had a son together before their wedding at their 
home in the Hamptons in 2009.

A wedding announcement for the couple in a Hamptons wedding magazine says: 'Donna was already a mother when Nahill met 
her, and Donna’s daughter quickly became an important part of his life.'

She
explained their choice of using orange for decorations at their 
wedding, explaining: 'Nothing in our lives is traditional or about 
"following the rules".'

Mr Marino is believed to be in touch with his now-seven-year-old daughter.

Ms
Savaterre was said to have revealed the secret to friends and showed 
them photographs of her and the quarterback together at restaurants and 
clubs.

She is also said to have made 
attempts to change the name of her and Marino’s daughter from Chloe 
Alexis Savattere to Chloe Alexis Younis, according to records.

Marino also has six children with his
wife Claire: Daniel, 26, Michael, 24, Joseph, 23, Ali, 20, Lia, 
17, and Niki, 16. The couple adopted Lia and Niki from China.

One of their sons, Michael, was 
diagnosed with autism when he was two, and the family has been striving 
to bring public awareness of autism since establishing the Dan Marino 
Foundation in 1992.

The football hero is set to appear on
CBS this weekend as part of its coverage of Sunday's Super Bowl, where 
the San Francisco 49ers will take on the Baltimore Ravens.

Kaepernick.

league history, holding or having held almost every major NFL passing 
record.

Although he was never part of a Super

Mr Marino starred as himself in the 1994 comedy Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.

The storyline involved a football player becoming obsessed with the quarterback who taught him how to kick.

In
December 2011, New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees broke Dan 
Marino's 27-year-old record for the number of passing yards in an NFL 
season.

Brees' final 
pass of the 45-16 home victory over the Atlanta Falcons, a nine-yard 
touchdown toss to Darren Sproles, took him to 5,087 yards, beating 
Marino's 5,084 for the Miami Dolphins in 1984.
