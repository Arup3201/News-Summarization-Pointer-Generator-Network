Dennis Farina, Tom Clancy and Cory Monteith were the big movie industry names to miss out on a mention at the Oscars' annual 'In Memoriam' portion of the show.

Dennis Farina starred in Michael Mann's film Thief in 1981, Midnight Run alongside Robert De Niro in 1988, Saving Private Ryan and Snatch.

Author Tom Clancy, whose Jack Ryan spy thrillers have been adapted for the big screen, was left out of the list. Despite not writing the screenplays, a number of his books including The Hunt For Red October and Patriot Games, have been optioned for Hollywood blockbusters.

Although Cory Monteith starred in Glee: The 3D Concert Movie and had some other small silver-screen roles, he was mainly known as a TV star - who
 are not typically included in the Academy's tribute montage.

However his picture is included in the photo gallery on the Oscars' official website and a tribute was made at the Emmys in September.

Gilligan's Island's Russell Johnson, All in the Family's Jean Stapleton and The Fresh Prince of Bel Air's James Avery were also omitted.

A few movie industry names were missed because they died after the 'In Memoriam' section was edited.

French director Alain Resnais who made New Wave films including Hiroshima, Mon Amour died on Saturday, too late to be included in the tribute.

Fresh Prince Of Bel Air actor James Avery was also missed off the Oscars' tribute as was best-selling author Tom Clancy (right) whose Jack Ryan series has been adapted into several blockbusters

However camera assistant Sarah Jones, 27, who was killed last week after being struck by a train on the set of Midnight Rider was included after a last-minute edit.

Several Oscar nominees wore black armbands in memory of her. Malcolm Clarke, winning director of The Lady in Number 6: Music Saved My Life, Gravity film editor Mark Sanger, and Gravity sound editor Glenn Fremantle all wore ribbons in Jones' memory during their acceptance speeches.

Syd Field, a screenwriter and author who died on November 17, was left off the list as was comic actor Jonathan Winters who starred in The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming and It's a Mad, 
Mad, Mad, Mad World.

Sarah Jones was only 27 when she died on the set of 'Midnight Rider' during pre-production in Georgia

Sadly, it was a long list of stars and cinema greats who passed in 2014:
