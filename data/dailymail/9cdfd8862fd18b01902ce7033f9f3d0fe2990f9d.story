A high profile cancer doctor has told how he suspected his mistress of poisoning him but did not tell the authorities  because he 'feared for his life.'

George Blumenschein, 50, testified in a Houston Texas court that he doubted that his mistress, Ana Maria Gonzalez Angulo, a fellow cancer doctor was capable of committing the heinous act.

‘I wanted them to find out it wasn't who I thought it was,’ he said in the the 248th District Court at the Harris County Criminal Justice Center in Houston, Texas.

Disbelief: George Blumenschein, 50, said he could not believe that his mistress, Ana Maria Gonzalez Angulo, a fellow cancer doctor could have committed the heinous act

Obsessed: Ana Maria Gonzalez-Angulo stands accused of poisoning her ex-lover and co-worker with antifreeze

He also said he was petrified that she would find out that he knew what she was doing whilst he was in a hospital bed.

Blumenschein was poisoned in January 2013.

He was tasked with helping investigators discover what happened.

Gonzalez-Angulo was arrested later and is on trial for assault, accused of poisoning her lover with a sweet tasting chemical found in anti-freeze.

The 43-year-old Colombian oncologist faces life in prison if convicted.

Blumenschein testified on Friday that he had secretly recorded Gonzalez-Angulo after he got out of the hospital because he feared for his life, according to the Houston Chronicle.

He was also fearful of what she might do to his girlfriend Evette Toney.

During his testimony, the doctor was forced to reveal intimate details of his affair with Gonzalez-Angulo.

Sickening: Traces of the chemical ethylene glycol were found in Blumenschein's system. The chemical is a common ingredient in automotive antifreeze

The two met whilst working at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and started a casual sexual relationship in 2011, while Blumenschein was living with his long-term girlfriend Toney.

Earlier in the trial, prosecutors argued that Gonzalez-Angulo had a 'fatal attraction' to Blumenschein, and poisoned him when she found out that his girlfriend had suffered a miscarriage.

The MD had been living with Toney for years, but said Gonzalez-Angulo started sitting on his lap while the two collaborated at work in March 2011.

A few weeks later, she kissed his neck while sitting on his lap.

Co-workers: Blumenschein met Gonzalez-Angulo at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas where they both worked

Their relationship developed further in the fall of 2011 when they had oral sex on a business trip in Stockholm, Sweden, Blumenschein said.

But he said that the two never had intercourse. He said he did not want to cross that line because of his relationship with Toney.

‘It was hard to tell her 'no,' Blumenschein testified: ‘It was hard to tell her 'no as no does not mean no to her.’

The affair lasted for 18 months..

On January 27, 2013, Gonzalez-Angulo invited him over for a light breakfast and ‘special coffee from Colombia,’ Blumenschein said.

Hours after drinking the coffee he became ill.

He described the feeling like being tipsy. He could barely stand up and had trouble talking.

He said that Gonzalez-Angulo joined him for dinner but he could not hold his phone or his utensils.

After he stumbled out of the restaurant, his supervisor asked him if had taken the narcotic Oxycotin – but he said he had never done drugs.

He said most of the day was a blur and he does not remember much of what happened but he finally drove himself to the hospital as Gonzalez-Angulo followed him.

He ended up in a hospital bed after being informed he had been poisoned.

Whilst on the stand, he said that he was having a hard time telling his story because he had almost died.

However, Gonzalez-Angulo defense team says there is no conclusive proof that the coffee was poisoned, and that the prosecution has dramatized the relationship 'to fit a theory that just doesn't match the facts'.
