Evicted: Colonel Gaddafi's daughter Aisha was kicked out of her Algerian safe-house because she kept setting fire to it in fits of anger

Colonel Gaddafi’s lawyer daughter was kicked out of her Algerian safe-house because she kept setting fire to it in fits of anger, it emerged today.

Aisha Gaddafi, 37, has an arrest warrant against her name after fleeing Libya when her father was deposed and then killed two years ago.

The bleach blonde, western educated ‘Claudia Schiffer  of North Africa’ was widowed in the bombing raids which destroyed Gaddafi’s regime, leaving her as a single mother.

Soon afterwards she arrived in neighbouring Algeria with other family members, and they were given a presidential residence in the south of the country.

But now it has emerged that Ms Gaddafi, who was once a UN Goodwill Ambassador, was so angry at what happened to her father that she kept vandalising furniture and attacking guards.

‘She ended up blaming Algeria for many of her problems, and also began starting fires in the house,’ said a government source in Algiers.

‘Shelves in the library went up in flames, as she regularly attacked army personnel looking after her safety.’

The situation came to a head late last year when she destroyed a portrait of Algerian president Abdul Aziz Bouteflika, Algerian newspaper Ennahar reported.

This led to Aisha being kicked out of the country, and eventually finding sanctuary with Oman, Britain’s closest ally in the Gulf. 

Escaped: Colonel Gaddafi  who died in 2011 and his wife Safia who fled Libya with his daughter Aisha

Aisha, Gaddafi’s widow, Safia, and sons Mohammad and Hannibal, as well as their children, have all been living there since October 2012.

They have been granted asylum on ‘humanitarian grounds’ and their expenses are being covered entirely by the Omani government.

This is despite all members of the family having deeply controversial pasts, having once shared all the wealth and privilege enjoyed by the tyrant, who was deposed and killed in 2011.

Ms Gaddafi had a baby girl after evading rebel forces in her home country.

Aisha is Gaddafi’s only biological daughter, and spoke out in support of her father throughout the civil war.

‘He is my remedy against pain and my fortress against grief,’ she said.

Aisha also spoke up for Saddam Hussein following the Iraq War. ‘When you have an occupying army coming from abroad, raping your women and killing your own people, it is only legitimate that you fight them,’ she said at the time.

In 2006 she married her cousin Ahmed al-Gaddafi al-Qahsi, an army colonel with whom she had three children.

Qahsi was killed during a bombing raid on one of Gaddafi’s compounds.

Hannibal Gaddafi was renowned for his abuse of servants, and for once allegedly beating up his wife in a suite at Claridge’s Hotel in central London.

Aisha and Hannibal are both currently wanted on Interpol arrest warrants issued at the request of Libya's new government.

The Gaddafi family’s luxurious lifestyle in Libya came to an end during the revolt against the despot, which was supported by RAF bombing raids sanctioned by David Cameron.

Since Gaddafi’s demise, there have been fears that family members will revive his legacy, and return to the blighted North African country to try and gain power again.
