Nick Clegg today admitted that a government crackdown on vile websites will not be enough to protect children from web filth.

The Deputy Prime Minister said parents had to police what youngsters were viewing online.

And he called for very young children to be taught about the dangers that lurk on the internet to ‘make the child responsible’.

Warning: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, pictured today, said parents had to keep a close watch on what children viewed online

David Cameron has spearheaded a government crackdown on 'poisonous' websites which he says are 'corroding childhood'.

In a major speech last week he announced every householder connected to the internet will have their access to online porn blocked unless they ask to receive it. Pornography depicting rape will be outlawed.

But Mr Clegg said pop-up warnings would not be enough and parents had to tightly control what their family views on the internet.

Speaking on his weekly radio phone-in he said: ‘At the end of the day we are giving our children unparalleled opportunities to access more information than any previous generation's ever had access to.

‘And I don't think there's a simple 
push-of-a-button solution. Yes you need to use technology but you also 
need at a much earlier age than any of us were used to, to actually 
educate kids to kind of take quite mature decisions for themselves.

Dangers: The Prime Minister said he was worried about his children's access to the internet, including using his iPad

‘That's a tricky thing to do,’ he told LBC 97.3.

Mr Clegg is the latest senior politician to voice fears about what his children are viewing online.

Labour leader Ed Miliband has said that ‘like any parent’ he was concerned about how easy it is for sons Daniel, four, and 2-year-old Sam to see violent adult images on mobile phones or computers.

And earlier this week Mr Cameron revealed he will allow his children to have Facebook accounts – but only if he can monitor what they post.

The Prime Minister said he was worried that holiday snaps uploaded to social networking sites could stop his three children from securing jobs in future.

He also revealed he has started talking to his nine-year-old daughter Nancy about the pressures put on young girls by images of women in the media.

Mr Clegg said his three sons, aged 11, nine and four, do not yet have Facebook pages and said the company's lower age limit of 13 for membership ‘feels about right’.

The Deputy Prime Minister said his children - particularly eldest son Antonio - ‘spend a lot of time... taking my wife's iPad and playing around on it’.

He added: ‘I'm forever kind of sort of peering over his shoulder, making sure that, like any anxious parent, he doesn't stumble on stuff that you don't want your child to see...

‘I can see it with him and his friends and his peer group. They are all incredibly tech-savvy already, particularly on tablets. They spend a lot of time telling each other "Look at this clip, look at that clip" on YouTube. So they're forever dipping in and out.’

Mr Clegg explained how he had tried to ensure his son used the internet safely: ‘Of course I've had to sit down with my 11-year-old and say, `There's stuff that you can get to see on this machine which I don't want you to see and which you want to'. You have to try and make the child responsible.’
