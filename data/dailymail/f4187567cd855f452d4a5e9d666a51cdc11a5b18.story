Kimi Raikkonen is in trouble with Bernie Ecclestone for defying an order to respect the national anthem before the race.

Raikkonen refused to join every other driver at the front of the grid for the playing of the Star Spangled Banner at last week’s US Grand Prix in Austin.

His non-show has annoyed Ecclestone, who issued an edict last month calling for ‘total silence on the starting grid’ because ‘it has been alleged that F1 is one of the most ill-mannered sports in relation to the national anthem and complaints from fans, public and political institutions are now too heavy to ignore.’

A representative of Ecclestone has spoken to the driver and his manager, saying half tongue in cheek that Raikkonen could get away with doing whatever he wanted when he was quick but can’t now he is slow.

A Ferrari spokesman said Raikkonen’s non-attendance was due to an ‘unfortunate miscommunication’ and that there will be no repeat.

It is not the first time Raikkonen has caused controversy on the grid. In the race in Sao Paulo eight years ago he missed a pre-race presentation by Pele, explaining to Martin Brundle live on ITV that he was ‘having a s***’ at the time.
