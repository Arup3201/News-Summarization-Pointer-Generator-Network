Celebrities are donning stockings on their head to show support for a seven-year-old girl who lost her hair after her cancer treatment.

The social media craze, known as #tighthairdo, was inspired by schoolgirl Jordyn Miller who found a creative way to cope with bullies after she was teased for losing her her hair due to chemotherapy.

As people became aware of little girl's experience, they have posted photos on social media with stocking on their heads just like Jordyn did in a sign of solidarity, accompanied by a hashtag declaring 'Jordyn is beautiful'. 

TV chef Manu Feildel, Big Brother winner Tim Dormer, Olympic swimmer Eamon Sullivan and presenter Jessica Rowe are just some of the people that have ptaken part to raise money to help children recovering from cancer battles.

On her first day of school, the six-year-old refused to remove her hat and was bullied for 'looking like a boy'

At just five-years-old Jordyn was diagnosed with 'Wilm's tumor', a cancer of the kidneys.  

After five months of chemotherapy and a long recovery from surgery, the kindergarten student was so nervous to return to school that she refused to remove her hat. 

The little girl from Wingham on the north coast of New South Wales, was upset after losing her long, wavy hair.

'She used to have beautiful, long curly hair that she used to love – she's a very girly girl and the chemo caused it to fall out which was a big deal for Jordyn,' Her mother Tarin Miller,33, told Daily Mail Australia.

Unfortunately, her fear that the other kids would make fun of her was not unfounded.

'When she first started school, she was shy about it and kids being kids used to tease her about looking like a boy. They'd call her ugly.' 

One of her daughter's coping mechanisms was to wear a pair of tights or a tea-towel on her head.

'One day Jordan just come out of her room with the tights on her head and said 'this is my beautiful long hair' and Charli, being her little sister, just copied,' she said.

The sibling would spend entire days with tea towels or tights on their heads, even enlisting their cousin whenever she would visit.

Camp Quality posted the pictures on their Facebook page. The beautiful images of Charli and Jordyn grinning with their stocking hair were shared widely.

Touched by the image of sisterly support, people chose to join in by posting images of themselves with tights on their head with #tighthairdo and #jordynisbeautiful.

Camp Quality decided to use the opportunity to start a social media campaign, inspired by the success of the 2014 craze, the Ice Bucket Challenge. The challenge raised money for ALS by asking people to throw icy buckets of water on their heads, donate money to the cause and nominate friends to do the same.

TV chef Miguel Maestre also wanted people to wear tights and nominate people to help raise money for puppet shows which help make school children aware of how to be kind and considerate of children returning to school after cancer treatment

Camp Quality set up a text donation platform, so people could donate to nominate the next friends they wanted to see post a #tighthairdo.

Celebrities who have already gotten behind the campaign and posted a #tighthairdo include TV chef Manu Feildel, Big Brother winner Tim Dormer, Olympic swimmers Eamon Sullivan and Alicia Coutts and former Vogue Editor Kirstie Clements.

News presenter Mark Ferguson, TV presenter Jessica Rowe and Sydney Kings basketball players have also shown their support for Jordyn and all children undergoing cancer treatment. 

Jana Cooper, Camp Quality's Marketing Manager, said: 'The point of difference between this campaign and the Ice Bucket Challenge or the #nomakeupselfie, is that the whole idea centres around kids.'

'It was created by kids, it raises money for kids and we've seen many kids get involved. Something else that makes it unique is that it was born in Australia and it uses an Australian text donation service.

To be involved, people simply need to text 'Jordyn' to 0476 000 222 to donate.

Camp Quality has been performing a puppet show in schools across the country to encourage students to support  their peers who are suffering or recovering from cancer

All funds donated to the campaign will help fund Camp Quality’s touring puppet show for schools.

These shows teach pupils how to be supportive and understanding of kids living with cancer.

The performance is incredibly effective in preventing and tackling teasing, staring and name-calling when a child returns to school post-treatment. 

A urine infection led to the discovery of a tumour in Jordyn's left kidney. She was quickly diagnosed with stage one cancer and was signed up for surgery to remove the organ.

According to Gary Nunn from the cancer charity Camp Quality, Jordyn is one of 10,000 children across Australia who are currently newly diagnosed, under treatment or in remission from cancer treatment.

The show discourages bullying and expels myths that children hold about cancer, including that it is contagious, encouraging them to support and include kids with 

Mr Nunn told Daily Mail Australia that after all the emotional and physical hardships endured by the children throughout their treatment, just as things are starting to look up, one of the most common problems they encounter is bullying.

'We've heard about everything from pointing and staring and: 'mummy, why does she looks so different?' to exclusion and isolation,' Mr Nunn said. 

'Exclusion is one of the more common ones, kids are often left out because other kids think that they can catch cancer and it's contagious.

'We hear it a lot and there was one incident of name calling recently where we had a mum ringing us up and saying her daughter was being called 'baldie' and some of the kids were taking off her beanie and throwing it and playing catch with it'. 

Camp Quality is determined to change this mentality and teach children that there is no need to cover up the effects of their cancer treatment, while educating their peers about how to be supportive and understanding of kids living with cancer.

The charity has been roaming the country with their educational puppet show on the request of parents and teachers, to expel the myths around cancer.

Gary Nunn, a spokesperson for the cancer charity, said that by the end of the show ,the kids are all cheering for the bald puppet character to take off her hat

Their show has been viewed by over 230,000 children in the last year and relies on public support to continue running. It involves a bald cancer-patient puppet who tries to decide if she should take off her hat - just like little Jordyn.

'By the end of the show the kids are all cheering for her to take off her hat,' Mr Nunn explains.

'Once our puppet show had come to one school, we heard of a girl who went back to her class and quietly removed her hat and she didn't wear it from then on. Once we teach the students about it, that child becomes a sort of hero for all they've been through and they have other children falling over themselves to be their friend.' 

After Mrs Miller asked Camp Quality to come to her daughter's school to perform their puppet show, she said there was an instant change in attitude.  

Now, whilst her hair is still much shorter than it once was, Jordyn - who is now in remission - often tells her mother how much she's looking forward to having long hair again.
