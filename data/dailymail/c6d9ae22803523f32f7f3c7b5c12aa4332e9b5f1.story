Intelligence obtained from a secret US eavesdropping operation helped prevent terror attacks at the 2012 Olympics, it was revealed yesterday.

William Hague defended collaboration between Britain’s GCHQ agency and the National Security Agency in America as a ‘cornerstone’ of national security that had protected London.

The Foreign Secretary dismissed as ‘baseless’ claims that British spy chiefs have used the American espionage programme Prism to circumvent UK law and snoop on emails and phone calls.

Defence: Prime Minister David Cameron and Foreign Secretary William Hague today defended British spy agencies, including GCHQ, against claims they used data from the US to circumvent UK law

But he admitted personally approving ‘hundreds’ of intelligence missions ‘every year’ – many of them involving US spies.

Ed Snowden – a former CIA man and whistleblower who has fled to Hong Kong – claims the NSA has had access to data held by nine of the world’s top internet companies, including Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Skype.

But Mr Hague told the Commons yesterday all intelligence obtained from America is subject to British law with approvals from a Cabinet minister, overseen by the Intelligence Commissioner.

In a robust defence of British spy chiefs, Mr Hague described ties between GCHQ and the NSA as ‘a relationship that is unique in the world’.

‘This relationship has been and remains essential to the security of both nations, has stopped many terrorist and espionage plots against this country, and has saved many lives,’ he told MPs.

‘We have experienced an extremely busy period in intelligence and diplomacy in the last three years. The growing and diffuse nature of threats from terrorists, criminals or espionage has only increased the importance of the intelligence relationship with the United States.

‘This was particularly the case in the run to the Olympics. Our activity to counter terrorism intensified and rose to a peak in the summer of last year.’

The Prime Minister was challenged about the work of GCHQ on a visit to the new London Gateway container port which is under construction on the River Thames  near Tilbury in Essex

Mr Hague did not specifically credit 
Prism with saving the Olympics from a terror strike, but a senior 
security source told the Mail the Prism programme ‘was an important 
component of our counterrorism preparations ahead of the Olympics’.

The Foreign Secretary added: ‘It has 
been suggested GCHQ uses our partnership with the United States to get 
around UK law, obtaining information that they cannot legally obtain in 
the UK. I wish to be absolutely clear that this accusation is baseless.

‘Any data obtained by us from the US involving UK nationals is subject to proper UK statutory controls and safeguards.’

But David Blunkett, the Labour former home secretary, suggested the rules were not tight enough and that if the US offered intelligence to the UK, rather than it being requested, no ministerial warrant was required.

The Foreign Secretary declined to spell out details of how Britain uses Prism, saying he would not comment on leaks.

Fanciful: Downing Street today dismissed the idea that staff at Cheltenham-based GCHQ worked to find ways to circumvent the law

Whistleblower: Edward Snowden, a 29-year-old former CIA technical assistant, claims GCHQ compiled 197 dossiers on UK citizens based on information from the US spying project Prism

He insisted British law does not 
allow ‘indiscriminate trawling through peoples’ communications’. But he 
made clear that terrorists and organised crime bosses ‘cannot rely on 
their privacy’ being preserved.

Parliament’s intelligence and security committee, headed by Sir Malcolm Rifkind, will receive a full report from GCHQ today on Prism. Leaked documents suggest the programme helped produce 197 intelligence reports last year.

A group of civil liberties campaigners accused ministers of using the sort of justifications for monitoring ‘we might expect from China, not the UK’.

In a joint statement, Index on 
Censorship, English PEN, and Open Rights Group said: ‘Mass surveillance 
chills freedom of expression and undermines our fundamental rights to 
freedom of expression and privacy.’

Shami Chakrabarti of Liberty said: 
‘The Foreign Secretary’s statement to Parliament is most revealing for 
what he refused to reveal. He evaded specific questions as brazenly as 
his agencies have apparently avoided legal scrutiny.

‘Reports to a secret committee are a 
start but the public won’t be satisfied without greater honesty and 
legal protection from those who compromise our freedoms in freedom’s 
name.’

Under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, police and the security services can access a wide variety of communications data.

At the lower level, this can include records of who a person was calling or texting, but not the content of the call.

The current row is focussed on a far more intrusive level of surveillance: the actual contents of internet telephone calls, emails and postings on social networking sites.

The security services and police already have far-reaching powers to monitor this sensitive information, provided they get a ministerial warrant.

The issue is over what happens when the intelligence agencies know a terror suspect is using new internet technologies, based overseas, which they currently find extremely difficult to access.

In this scenario, and assuming the U.S. can carry out the surveillance, it’s inevitable that the UK’s spies will wish to ask their closest ally for help.

The key question is would it be legal for the British agents to do the work themselves, were they able to do it?

If the answer is yes, GCHQ – on behalf of the British intelligence services – will submit a request to the NSA. The results can then be shared with MI5 and MI6.
