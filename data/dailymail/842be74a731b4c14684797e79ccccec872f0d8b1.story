Liverpool have joined the queue of clubs keen to sign Sevilla left-back Alberto Moreno.

The Spain international was part of Sevilla's Europa League winning side on Wednesday night.

He is valued at £20m and has been scouted by Chelsea, Manchester City and United this season. Real Madrid are also keen.

On the slide: Moreno stops a Benfica attack during the Europa League final

Wanted man: Liverpool have joined the likes of Chelsea and Real Madrid in pursuing the defender

Options: Liverpool could yet turn their attentions to full-back Siqueira, who played for Benfica in the final

Liverpool's alternative target is Granada's Guilherme Siqueira who has been on loan at Benfica, and also played in the Europa League final.

Brendan Rogers is also interested in bringing in a goalkeeper, a central defender and another, with Michel Vorm of Swansea, Cardiff City defender Steven Caulker and Southampton's Alan Lallana all Anfield targets.
