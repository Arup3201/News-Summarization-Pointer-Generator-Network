Not good enough: Chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee said the number revealed that only one per cent of illegal immigration reports result in someone being removed

Only one in every hundred reports of an illegal immigrant results in someone being forcibly removed from Britain, the Home Office has admitted.

The figures are laid bare by a new hotline which was set up last year for members of the public to report suspected illegal immigrants.

Between September 2012 and June this year, there were 48,660 calls to the Home Officeâ€™s Allegations Management System (AMS).

Of these, 2,695 led to a visit by an immigration enforcement officer. Those visits resulted in 1,840 arrests and 660 eventual deportations.

This means just over one per cent of all reports actually result in a suspected illegal immigrant being removed.

The disappointing ratio was revealed by MP Keith Vaz, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, as the group of MPs heard evidence from the new head of immigrations enforcement Dave Wood yesterday afternoon.

Mr Vaz told him: 'It does not seem like a big hit rate to me.'

But Mr Wood defended the figures and argued that allegations often do not provide enough intelligence for the authorities to act on.

He said: 'The intelligence we get from the allegations often do not provide information likely to lead to an arrest.

'Sometimes it is actionable.'

Questions: The new head of immigration enforcement Dave Wood defended the ratio of allegations to deportations

In March the Home Secretary Theresa May abolished the UK Border Agency and split it into two bodies - UK Visas and Immigration and an Immigration Enforcement command, which are now under the control of ministers.

Mr Wood is the new head of Immigration Enforcement.

Mrs May also gave evidence to the committee in which she acknowledged that the lengthy appeals process used by illegal immigrants to stay in the country must change.

'We need to look at the number of appeals people are able to go through,' she said.

Mrs May said the forthcoming Immigration Bill will close down the number of avenues of appeal open to illegal immigrants and result in people being deported more quickly.

'I think members of the public get very upset when they see people going from appeal to appeal trying one route then another. I think we do need to look at that system,' she added.
