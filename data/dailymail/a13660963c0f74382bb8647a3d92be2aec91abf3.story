A Rolling Stones fan who was man handled and ejected from the bands concert in Adelaide after invading the stage has requested the band return his glasses.

Erin John Vallace, a backstage crew worker, ran onto the stage in a bid to rub shoulders with the band during a performance in Adelaide oval.

But security made quick work of the 31-year-old, barging him over and hauling him off the stage before evicting him from the premises.

Mr Vallace, who was working as a general backstage general site crew, was later fined $560 for disorderly conduct, which is a fraction of the $5000 fine dished out for pitch invaders of AFL games.

Jagger doesn't bat an eyelid as Mr Vallance charged at him from back stage, later telling the crowd it was ‘all part of the act, some Aussie rules tackling!’

Guitarist Keith Richards later stumbled over the glasses Mr Vallance left on the stage, prompting him to move them out of harms way

Mr Vallance posted on Facebook that he suffered blood clots from the securities rough response

A YouTube clip of the tackle shows Mr Vallance, sporting a high-vis vest and hoodie, charging towards leader singer Mick Jagger, before a burly security guard floors him by the scruff of his shirt, dragging him off the stage with so much force he loses his glasses. 

Mr Valance later posted an apology on the bands Facebook page, writing: ‘Sorry about the intrusion...Couldnt [sic] help myself...Just wanted to show my moves like Jagger...Instead i was moved away from Jagger at a swift pace..Best show ive ever been to!Thankyou for saving my glasses!Can i have them back now please sir.’

He also wrote on his personal Facebook page that he has blood clots from the security 'slamming his kidneys,' but that it was ‘worth it.’

There are reports that Jagger told fans it was ‘all part of the act, some Aussie rules tackling.’

But while the singer was unfazed, guitarist Keith Richards later stumbled Mr Vallance's glasses, prompting him to move them off the stage.

'The intruder was dealt with by the band's security and was subsequently handed over to SAPOL,' Adelaide Oval Stadium Management Authority general manager Darren Chandler told Daily Mail Australia.

'We believe the man came from back-stage and was not a concert goer.' 

Adelaide Now has reported that his chances of future employment are hindered by the incident.
