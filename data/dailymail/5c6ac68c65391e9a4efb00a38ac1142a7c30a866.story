A nanny caring for a baby who was having a good old cry before settling down for her afternoon nap got the shock of her life when the police showed up following a complaint.

Jenna Cooper says that when she got home from work this past August she was terrified when her nanny informed her that a mother at the playground had called the police on her. 

Little did she know just why police were called.

Over the line: Jenna Cooper (above with daughter Anna) was shocked to learn a Brooklyn mother called the police on her nanny because her baby was crying 

'I heard the word "police," and got really nervous,' Cooper, a lawyer, told Yahoo Parenting. 

'But after my nanny Nicki explained the situation to me, my worry turned to anger and disbelief.'

Anna, the young child in question, often would take her afternoon nap in her stroller, and it being summer she and Nicki were at the park when she went down for her nap.

And, like almost every other toddler and child being out down for a nap, Anna began to cry - loudly.

'My daughter has a strong set of lungs, and she sometimes cries when she’s put down to nap, as I imagine many kids do,' said .

'Since we did sleep training with her when she was very young, we’re fine with that — as Nicki knows.'

Taking it too far: Jenna (with her husband and Anna) explained that her daughter usually takes her afternoon nap in her stroller, and often cries

A local mother was not fine with this however, and went over to Nicki to ask why the baby was crying.

After Nicki explained the woman walked off, accusing her of neglect, and called the police.

Unfortunately for the angry woman, by the time police arrived, Anna was asleep and they were confused as to why they had been called in. 

Feeling bad for Nicki, and upset, Jenna then did what many mother in Brooklyn do, writing about what happened her neighborhood listserv.

'As I told our nanny, if she had let my daughter crawl/play around unsupervised, I would obviously have a serious problem and would appreciate someone looking out for my daughter’s safety,' she wrote. 

'But the fact that she let her cry before a nap is totally par for the course and in my mind does not constitute anything close to neglect. (If you think it does, you should call the cops on me, too.)' 

Happy girl: Jenna (with Anna) then wrote on a local listserv about the incident, saying to call the police was inappropriate 

'While I appreciate that parents in the neighborhood are keeping a watchful eye while some of us are working, let’s remember that getting the police involved is a serious decision and one that should be reserved for obvious cases of neglect/abuse, not merely situations that exemplify child-rearing styles different than one’s own.'

Lucky for Jenna, almost everyone seemed to agree with her.

Wrote one father, 'In a world of internet intemperance and incendiary outbursts, you have written a response to provocation that is a model of sanity and reason.'
