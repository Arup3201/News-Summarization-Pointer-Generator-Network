A breathtakingly expensive divorce battle between a major Laura Ashley stakeholder and his wife - a former Miss Malaysia - has been branded ‘out of control’ in an extraordinary attack by a High Court judge.

Foreign divorce cases like this one that are fought in England deny people in need ‘precious court time’ for more serious legal matters, said Mr Justice Holman during a taxpayer-funded hearing.

He said parents who were seeking ‘precious court time to recover their children from abduction’ would be kept waiting as long as lengthy foreign divorce cases were allowed clog up the British courts.

The Malaysian couple, Mr Khoo Kay Peng, 75, who owns a 40per cent stake in Laura Ashley and his estranged wife Pauline Chai, 66, have already wracked up costs of £1.6 million on what Mr Holman called ‘preliminary skirmishes’ in the extraordinary battle.

Mr Chai, who owns a £30million property in Hertfordshire, has alone incurred costs of £920,000 in England fighting the case.

But the senior judge pointed out that the couple, who do not pay tax in Britain, are actually paying a fraction of the costs of the taxpayer-funded court hearings, have only contributed £2,355 towards six days of court fees.

Mr Justice Holman said: ‘Neither of them are British citizens. Neither of them currently pays any English taxes whatsoever.

‘Very serious issues ought to arise as to just how much time of an English court these parties should be able to take up on these preliminary skirmishes, whilst squeezing out the many needy litigants who need precious court time to recover their children from abduction or seek their return from care, and other such issues.’

Ms Chai is seeking £500 million in the case, which would represent the largest divorce settlement in Britain to date.

Khoo Kay Peng and Pauline Chai are the most recent in a long line of foreign couples to seek a multi-million pound divorce in the UK.

Just two days ago, stay-at-home husband Weng Choy won a crucial battle to his £11million divorce settled in English court.

The couple led a luxury lifestyle - with homes in Hong Kong and Malaysia, a £1million wine collection and £4.5million apartment in Kensington - but Mr Choy says he gave up his personal ambitions to allow his 'breadwinner' wife Lena Tan to pursue her career.

Ms Tan had fought having the divorce heard in Britain on the grounds that the Malaysian couple do not have any business interests in Britain - just property.

It is thought she wanted to have the case heard in Malaysia as British judges are widely considered to be 'generous' towards the partners of rich spouses.

But judges this week ruled Mr Choy could have his case heard in the UK because he had been 'habitually resident' for a year before the split.

In 2011, the late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky divorced his second wife in the costliest marriage split in British legal history.

The massive payment dwarfed the previous UK divorce record of £48million and came just two years before Mr Berezovsky's death.

It
 has not yet been decided whether the full divorce hearing will be heard
 in England or Malaysia. But the top judge said it ‘borders on the 
fantastic’ that ’10 days of precious court time’ have been reserved in 
October for the High Court to consider where the case will be heard.

A one-day hearing last week for an application for maintenance cost Ms Chai £55,000.

The judge described the cost of the worldwide litigation as ‘completely out of control’.

‘Phenomenal costs are being spent, a phenomenal amount of court time worldwide has already been taken up,’ he said.

Ms Chai now lives at Rossway Park, a £30 million, 1,000-acre estate near Berkhamsted in Hertfordshire.

The couple, who married in 1970 and have five children, lived a lavish lifestyle with properties in England, Kuala Lumpur and Australia, and an estate in Canada.

The judge said Dr Khoo must pay his wife a further £70,000 for living costs and £100,000 for legal costs for the seven weeks before the next hearing in April.

Ms Chai, who was Miss Malaysia in 1969, is represented by the ‘Diva of Divorce’ Ayesha Vardag, who said these legal fees are ‘small beer for the ultra rich’.

‘When you have a couple trying to divide up billions of hundreds of millions, the legal costs are generally high, because there’s enough at stake to make it worth it. It’s the biggest financial transaction most people will ever undergo.

‘Big cases are what make English justice affordable for the needy,’ she told the Independent.

Timothy Bishop, QC who represents Dr Khoo last year said that allowing the case to be held in London would bolster ‘the ill-gotten reputation of this country for being the divorce capital of the world’.
