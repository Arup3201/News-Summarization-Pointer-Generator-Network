Amelie Mauresmo watched as Andy Murray edged himself towards a place in London's season-end finale, her face almost as inscrutable as that of her predecessor Ivan Lendl.

Mauresmo takes a much more consensual approach than Lendl, and is delighted with the recent results which now see her client just one match away from ending any arguments about making the Barclays ATP World Tour finals next month.

After a comfortable 6-3 6-4 win over her compatriot Julien Benneteau in the Paris Masters his entry can be confirmed if he beats Grigor Dimitrov.

Mauresmo will regard qualification as a satisfactory conclusion to the first five months of their groundbreaking coaching arrangement, although she acknowledges it will up the ante for next season.

As she made clear, she is certainly different to the my-way-or-the-highway style of Lendl when it comes to coaching, suggesting that Murray is more in the driving seat than he was under Lendl.

'It's a manager's role without being a dictator, you are just there to be a guide,' she told L'Equipe newspaper. 'The driving force is the player. It's the player who drives the whole team with their obsession, their concern for each detail and their strong goals.

'The champions always question things. The demand is constant so you look around trying to find solutions and ways to adapt. It's the challenge that is interesting to me. If you have a beautiful adventure together it's great. If for any reason he wants to change or stop it's not a problem.

'Maybe when we arrive in Australia there will be more pressure. In the 2015 Grand Slams there will be more expectation. At present he is in a rising phase, at these moments you don't feel the pressure so much. What counts is not what people or the media says, the most important thing for me is the project. I'm not thinking "If he doesn't win I will be questioned".'

VIDEO Hard work paying off for Murray

The sometimes seen erratic on-court behaviour of Murray since the authoritative Lendl departed was absent as he dismissed Benneteau in 72 minutes, making light of the draining schedule which is now seeing him play six consecutive weeks.

Alex Corretja (2010–2011)

In 35 days there have been 19 victories, and the Scot has actually won more matches this year – 57 – than any other player bar Roger Federer. No wonder morale is high around the camp, but the real test for the Murray-Mauresmo partnership is likely to come next season.

It is the kind of dominant form that was proving so elusive for the British No 1 around the time that Dimitrov provided the most crushing disappointment of the season, the Wimbledon quarter-final defeat when he appeared to be tormented.

Amid SW19 mania there was much speculation about some he was supposed to have shouted at his box about something happening 'five minutes' before the match, although more reliable sources said it was '45 minutes'.

It was an unusual episode for Murray on the Centre Court – where he is usually so controlled, and hence the brouhaha – but more common at other less visible events.

'The stuff that I say on the court, anyone that knows anything about how my brain works would know it doesn't really actually mean much,' he said. 

'It was complete nonsense. It had no bearing on the outcome of the match at all. It was turned into something that was supposedly that I was having big problems with my team or with Amelie or with Danny (Vallverdu) or whatever. But it was completely not the case.'
