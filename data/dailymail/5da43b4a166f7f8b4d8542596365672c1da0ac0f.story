An air-and-sea search was suspended tonight by British and French rescuers investigating a light aircraft crash in the English Channel, coastguards said.

Fading light prompted authorities to call off attempts to find the missing pilot and a decision will be taken tomorrow morning about the next course of action.

The American-registered plane carrying one person, its British pilot, crashed about 15 miles off Dungeness in Kent at around 2.30pm.

A cross-Channel search and rescue operation was launched involving both English and French teams, including two helicopters and four boats.

An RAF rescue helicopter has now joined the search for the British pilot lost in the Channel after his light aircraft crashed some 15 miles off Dungeness, Kent, on his was to Le Touquet airport in northern France

The single-engine light aircraft had been heading from Blackbushe Airport, on the Hampshire and Surrey border, to Le Touquet, in northern France's Pas-de-Calais department.

The alarm was raised after the aircraft was overdue, a spokesman for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency MCA said.

The incident happened four miles inside UK waters and the search was being co-ordinated by the British with help from the French authorities.

The French search and rescue helicopter found wreckage around 15 miles off Dungeness, the MCA said.

Following the suspension of the search, an MCA spokesman said tonight: 'Further discussions will be held in the morning as to the next course of action.'

A search and rescue helicopter from RAF Wattisham had earlier joined in with the search, along with the Dungeness RNLI lifeboat, and three French vessels.

A spokesman for France's 'Manche Maritime' and North Sea prefecture said: 'Debris from the plane has been found in the sea some 20 nautical miles from Boulogne-sur-Mer.

'The plane was heading for Le Touquet airport in northern France.'

An Air Accidents Investigation Branch spokesman said: 'The AAIB have deployed a team to collect evidence and begin an initial investigation.

'The position of the aircraft will determine if the full investigation will be led by the AAIB or the French authorities.'

An MCA spokesman said earlier: 'We had reports that an aircraft was overdue. It was heading from London to Le Touquet.

'It was an American-registered aircraft with one person on board. The search has been involving a French helicopter and it has been searching for two hours.

'That will have to return shortly and that will be replaced by a search and rescue helicopter from RAF Wattisham in Suffolk.

'The Dungeness lifeboat is en route and we believe the Calais lifeboat is also involved. The search is ongoing at the moment to find the pilot.

'We still have about six hours of daylight left.'
