Investigation: The husband of Suzanne Newton, pictured, who was found dead at their suburban semi-detached home, has been arrested on suspicion of her murder

The husband of a woman who was found dead at their suburban semi-detached home has been arrested on suspicion of her murder.

The body of Suzanne Newton, 45, was discovered by police officers at the house in Melksham,Â  Wiltshire, on Sunday.

Police officers from three forces then began a hunt for her husband, Richard Newton, 51.

His car was later found abandoned 80 miles away in a remote corner of Exmoor in Somerset.

However, on Monday, Devon and Cornwall police raided a house in Dulverton, West Somerset, where they arrested Mr Newton.

He was taken to Taunton police station but later transferred to Musgrove Park Hospital with injuries.

He has since been discharged and remains in police custody at Melksham police station where he is being questioned on suspicion of murder.

Ms Newton, a keen horse rider, was employed by Darren Guinness Associates and colleagues at the Calne-based recruitment agency have left floral tributes outside her home.

One read: '18 flowers from 18 people thinking of you. Such a sad loss, lots of love from everyone at DGA (Darren Guinness Associates).'

Another said: 'RIP. Always in our hearts, sleep tight, sweet dreams. Julia, David and Caitlin.'

The body of Mrs Newton was discovered at an address in the Bowerhill area of Melksham on Sunday morning.

A forensic tent had been placed 
outside the property.

Newton's blue Volkswagen Polo was found unattended at Brendon Common, Exmoor, at around lunchtime on Sunday.

Neighbours of the victim spoke of their shock.

One said: 'It's quite a shock for 
something like this to happen so close to where you live, it's usually 
quite quiet around here.

'I knew her to say hello to, she had a
Jack Russell so I used to see her when she took it for walks.

'The first
I knew about it was when I was woken up at about ten to eight this 
morning by police banging on doors.

'When I opened my curtains I saw all the police outside.

'I knew it was something serious and not just a burglary because I saw the forensics tent.'

Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'It's more than a bit of a shock.

'Although it is a very large cul-de-sac, it isn't what you expect to carry on around here.'

A third neighbour said: 'We came past 
it yesterday and there were police there, but we were just surprised 
because we didn't think something like that would happen round here.

'The man who lives in that house is 
very hard working. He was always on his way to work - he had a small 
business, but I don't know doing what.'

Speaking to This is Wiltshire.co.uk, a neighbour said: 'It's very sad. She kept to herself, but we always used to see her walking her dog.'

A Wiltshire Police spokeswoman said: 'Formal identification has now been completed on the body of a woman found in a house in Melksham on Sunday 13th January.

'The woman has been identified as Suzanne Bavette Newton, 45, Bowerhill, Melksham.'

A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall police said: 'A man was arrested following a raid on a property in Dulverton.

'He was taken to a police station in Avon and Somerset.

'He was arrested on suspicion of murder and has been taken to Taunton police station where he will be collected by officers from Wiltshire.'
