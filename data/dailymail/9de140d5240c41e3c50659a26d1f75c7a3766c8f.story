Sam Vokes continued his comeback from injury with two goals as Burnley’s Development Squad hammered Blackpool 5-1 on Monday.

The Wales international is in contention to face Liverpool on Boxing Day after he completed 90 minutes in his fifth appearance for the U21 Development Squad since recovering from a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament in March.

Vokes opened the scoring in the 17th minute after a pass from Jason Gilchrist.
