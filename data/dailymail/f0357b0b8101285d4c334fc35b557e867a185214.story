A British man has been arrested on suspicion of sexually abusing underage girls in Cambodia after he was seen walking hand-in-hand with an 11-year-old girl in Phnom Penh.

Geneva-born Michael Jones, thought to be from South Wales, is said to have taken at least one underage girl to a rented room in the city on several occasions, and was seen ‘hugging and kissing’ her in public.

The 55-year-old was also pictured with half-dressed eight and nine-year-old girls and with a small child nestled on his lap.

Arrest: Suspected paedophile Michael Jones was arrested by Cambodian police after he was snapped strolling hand in hand with an 11-year-old girl in Phnom Pen

The images led to Jones' arrest on suspicion of sexually abusing girls in Cambodian capital Phnom Penh.

One 11-year-old has made allegations to police that she was paid £3 for sex after being taken three times to a rented room by a man.

Charity Action Pour Les Enfants (APLE) took the pictures of Jones while investigating him after suspicions were raised on his last visit in 2013.

‘On April 9, 2013, an APLE investigator commenced the investigation into Michael Jones when he was contacting two under-age Cambodian girls along the river front,’ an APLE spokesman said.

The children were thought to be 12 or 13.

‘Shortly afterward Michael Jones brought the same two under-age girls to a shopping centre, where APLE investigators witnessed him buying some unidentified stuff for the same two girls and he gave some money for the girls to play games.

‘After entertaining the two girls, he brought them back to their houses.’

On April 12, 2013, Michael Jones left Cambodia. His destination was unknown. Upon his return in June this year, APLE reactivated the investigation.

APLE found that Jones was in contact with an under-age girl whom he took into a rented room in the Lake Side area. They discovered that although he was staying in a hotel in Phnom Pen, he kept returning to the rented room with the same 11-year-old, an APLE spokesman said.

The charity say Jones took her shopping, bought her food and went to the cinema with her.

He is alleged to have been seen ‘hugging and kissing’ the girl and was seen to ‘groom’ three others.

The charity spokesman claimed Jones was seen promising to pay the rent for one family.

It is alleged he then abused youngsters under a bridge.

‘On June 24, the police from Phnom Penh Anti-Human Trafficking and Juvenile Protection Unit arrested Michael Jones at Olympic taxi station,’ the APLE spokesman said.

Six girls were taken to the police station to be interviewed.

Four claimed they had been abused by Jones, who is said to be from South Wales.

‘On June 27, 2014, Michael Jones was officially charged by Phnom Penh's court prosecutor and he was remanded to Prey Sar prison awaiting further court proceedings and trial,’ the APLE spokesman said.

He was charged with carrying out indecent acts against minors and paying for child prostitution.

If found guilty he faces eight years in jail.

‘After the rescue, one victim was referred to a secure shelter while the other three remain on the street with their family,’ the APLE spokesman said.

Laws exist to ban convicted paedophiles from travelling abroad, however UK police have no records of Jones offending in Britain.

‘South Wales Police Specialist Crime has not been made aware by the authorities in Cambodia of this arrest and are not involved in this investigation,’ a South Wales Police spokeswoman said.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We were informed of the arrest of a British national in Cambodia on June 24 this year. We are providing consular assistance.’
