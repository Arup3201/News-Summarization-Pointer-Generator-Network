In the spirit of upcoming Mother's Day, a new report has been published that reveals which are the best and worst countries in the world for moms to live.Â 

According to Save the Children's 15th annual State of the World's Mothers Report, Finland, Norway and Sweden are the safest places for mothers, but Africa, which houses the top ten worst countries to bring children into the world, is the most dangerous.

Somalia is considered the most dangerous place for mothers due to natural disaster as well as persistent conflict. Shockingly, the report found that six per cent of women in the African country are likely to die of a maternal cause, and a staggering 15per cent of children will perish before they turn five.

Maternal instinct: According to Save the Children's 15th annual State of the World's Mothers Report, Somalia is the most dangerous place for a mother to live, Finland is the best and the U.S. is only 31st

By contrast, in Finland, which ranked the top country, just one in 12,000 women will die because of maternal causes, and only one in 345 children will die before their fifth birthday.

The report looked at health, educational and economic factors in 178 nations to determine which are the safest and happiest places for mothers to live in.

It named the Democratic Republic of Congo the second to last country on the list because of 'horrific abuses against women and children', which has claimed - both directly and indirectly - more than 5.4million lives.

Indeed, the foundation noted that it is statistically more dangerous to be a woman or a child in the Democratic Republic of Congo than it is to be an armed fighter there.

And when it comes to child deaths, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo account for a staggering 20per cent of worldwide cases.

Other countries that ranked low on the list were Syria and the Philippines - the former due to the enduring civil war, and the latter because of a sequence of natural disasters.

Somewhat surprisingly, the U.S. ranked number 31 on the list, down from its place in the top ten in 2000.

Improvement? A recent report form the World Health Organization found that the deaths of women due to pregnancy-related causes has dropped, but the rate is still 33 an hour

The report cited natural disasters including hurricanes Sandy and Katrina as causes for this drop, as well as an increase in high-risk pregnancy among obese mothers and those with hypertension.

Save the Children emphasizes the importance of education, health care and aid in order to better the situation.

'Urgent actions [are] needed to support mothers who are raising the world's future generations under some of the most difficult and horrific circumstances imaginable,' it reads.

A recent report form the World Health Organization found that the deaths of women due to pregnancy-related causes has dropped since 1990.

But at 33 maternal deaths an hour worldwide, the Organization noted that the rate is still 'too high'.
