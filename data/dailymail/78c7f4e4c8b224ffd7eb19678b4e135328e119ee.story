Residents of a small town in Idaho are still so angry over the shooting of a disabled resident’s dog that they have launched an effort to oust the mayor and all of the city council members after the police officer who shot the animal was allowed to keep his job.

Officer Tarek Hassani returned to his regular patrol shift in the small town of Filer on Saturday, two months after the shooting that another police agency called justified.

After the shooting, officials in the city of just over 2,500 people held public hearings but decided to keep Hassani on the force.

Shooting: Tarek Hassani, of the Filer Police Department in Idaho, was filmed firing his gun a point blank range after being called to reports of dogs wandering in the street

That angered some residents, who accused officials of not doing enough, the Twin Falls Times-News reported.  

Petitions to recall Mayor Rick Dunn and all four City Council members were filed Tuesday.

Dunn
 told The Associated Press that residents have every right to seek a 
recall but he didn’t go so far as to speculate whether or not the 
attempt to oust him would be successful.

'I
 think they're going to do their best to make the recall work,' he said.
 'They only needed 20 (signatures) to start the process, and they've 
gotten that far.'

Recall 
organizers gathered 20 signatures for each city leader's recall 
petition, a procedural step that triggers an official drive.

That gives organizers 75 days to try to get a larger amount of signatures, a required 201 per official.

Working: The seven-year-old black Labrador named Hooch acted as a service dog for Parkinson's disease sufferer Rick Clubb

That
 figure is 20 per cent of the number of voters registered in the last 
city election. If Twin Falls County approves the petitions, the city 
will hold a recall election.

Hassani
 was placed on administrative leave shortly after he shot and killed a 
7-year-old black Labrador named Hooch on February 8.

The officer responded to a call of dogs running loose at a home in Filer when two of the animals began to circle him.

Video
 taken by a police dashboard-mounted camera shows Hooch and another dog 
barking at the officer and sometimes lunging toward him. Hassani kicked 
at Hooch before shooting him.

The
 dog's death launched protests and fiery testimony at Filer City Council
 meetings, where many residents called for Hassani's firing.

An
 investigation by the Police Department of Nampa, about 150 miles 
northwest of Filer, found the shooting was justified but the independent
 inquiry questioned why the officer didn't stay in his vehicle, call the
 owner of the dogs or call for backup.

A phone number for Hassani could not be located.

Mark
 Deaton, a former longtime Filer resident, told the newspaper that he 
and others were concerned that there was no warning when the officer 
returned to work.

'What we 
found out through this whole ordeal is no officers in Idaho get any kind
 of training in aggressive dog handling,' he said.

Filer
 officials have scheduled an eight-hour training session on how to deal 
with aggressive dogs for May 3. It will be required for Filer police, 
and officers from other towns also plan to attend.

Officers
 have had to escort people off Hassani's property since the shooting, 
Dunn said. The mayor said he's received death threats but that he didn't
 take them very seriously.

But it upset him that people across the country were getting a negative perceptive of his town based on the incident, Dunn said.

'I hate to see that,' he said.

'Filer is a nice town: We have good staff, good people here. Give Filer a little more credit than this.'
