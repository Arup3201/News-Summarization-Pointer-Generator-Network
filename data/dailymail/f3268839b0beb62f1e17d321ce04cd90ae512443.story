Thousands of Canadians are still without power on Monday, and many may not get it back by Christmas in what Toronto Mayor Rob Ford is calling one of the worst storms to hit the city.

A storm that ripped through Ontario caused downed power lines which cut off electricity to more than 300,000 customers, 200,000 in Toronto.

But Mayor Ford says it's still 'not even close' to warrant declaring a state of emergency.

About 100 trucks have been called in from other cities to help resture power in the area, but Toronto Hydro CEO Anthony Haines wouldn't guarantee all of the power will be restored by Christmas.

'My caution continues to be my caution. Let's really plan for the worst,' Mr Haines told CNN. 'I am encouraged in the progress we have made today, obviously, with well over 100,000 customers being restored today.'

The bitter cold in the area has also caused the city to open a dozen warming centers for an expected 300 people.

Across the U.S., weather was much tamer than this weekend when 10 died in weather-related incidents - though the upper midwest is bracing for more snow and temperatures of below 45 degrees in parts of Minnesota.

In Wisconsin, locals are using the region's famous cheese production facilities as a way to keep streets safe during the busy holiday travel season.

Instead of pricy, ineffective and sometimes toxic salts, local government officials are turning to salt brine used to flavor cheese as a way to keep the roads from freezing.

'We’re just trying to make every possible use of cheese,' Bay View district alderman Tony Zielinski told the New York Times. 'If this takes off, if this proves to be a success here, I’m sure that it will be used in cities all over the country.'

Municipalities in the region are turning to alternative de-icers like cheese brine for a more earth and cost-friendly alternative to regular road salt.

It also comes as a benefit for the local cheese producers who would usually have to pay exorbitant amounts to have the brines taken to local waste treatment plants.

The
 eastern half of the country was getting a 'plethora of winter weather' 
just days before the Christmas holiday, according to the National 
Weather Service.

According to the AAA, as many as 95 million people will be traveling to spend the festive period with loved ones this year.

Yesterday, 639 flights have been cancelled and 7,515 delayed, according to Flight Aware.

Major
 airports in Philadelphia and New York City were experiencing delays 
Sunday because of wind and visibility, according to the Federal Aviation
 Administration.

'This storm is bringing a little bit of everything, from rain, flooding and wind, to ice and snow in some areas,' said NWS meteorologist Bruce Sullivan. 'What is really extraordinary about this system, though, is the warm air.'In Canada, more than 205 flights were cancelled at Toronto’s Pearson Airport Sunday, about 27 per cent of all flights. Most flights are delayed and many are cancelled at the Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport.The first full day of winter Sunday brought a mix including balmy temperatures along the Mid-Atlantic, snow in the Midwest and ice, snow and flooding in the Great Lakes, and utilities warned that some people who lost electricity could remain in the dark through Wednesday.

More than 390,000 homes and businesses were without power Monday in Michigan, upstate New York and northern New England, down from Sunday's peak of more than a half million. The bulk were in Michigan, where more than 297,000 customers remained without power Monday. The state's largest utilities said it will be days before most of those get their electricity back because of the difficulty of working around ice-broken lines.In Maine, the number of people without power spiked to more than 68,000. A medical clinic in Bangor lost power, forcing walk-in patients to seek other options.'It's certainly not going away,' Margaret Curtis, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Gray, Maine, said Monday of the precipitation and cold. 'In fact, we don't have very many areas where we're expecting temperatures to rise above freezing.'That means untreated roads and sidewalks from the upper Midwest to northern New England will remain a slippery, dangerous mess as people head out for last-minute shopping or holiday travel. Parts of interior Maine were expected to get another quarter to half-inch of ice Monday.

Authorities reduced the speed limit along a 107-mile stretch of the Maine Turnpike from Kittery to Augusta as freezing rain continued to fall Monday morning and temperatures hovered around freezing. Dozens of flights out of Toronto were canceled while other airports in the storm-hit region were faring well despite the weather.In Maine, Judith Martin was heading from her home in South Grafton, Massachussetts to Kingston, when she stopped at a rest area along Interstate 95 in West Gardiner. She said roads got worse the farther north she drove.'The trees are loaded with ice, so it makes me think the road is loaded with ice,' Martin said.Power failures caused related concerns. Vermont's Department of Health warned people to be careful with generators and other equipment after a weekend spike in carbon monoxide poisonings. The department had half a dozen reports in one day, about what the state sees in a typical winter.While the cold will continue to harass people, there's no major precipitation on the horizon through the end of the week, Curtis said.

'It will give people some time to recover from this,' she said.Heavy snow in Wisconsin forced dozens of churches to cancel Sunday services. Milwaukee got about nine inches and Manitowoc, seven. Ice and snow in Oklahoma were blamed for three traffic deaths on slick roads.In New York's St Lawrence County, almost two inches of ice fell, coating tree limbs and power lines, and a state of emergency was declared to keep the roads clear of motorists. As of Monday morning, some 35,000 customers were still without power.The winter weather was far from nationwide, though. Record high temperatures were reached in some Mid-Atlantic states this weekend, but temperatures were expected to drop back to the mid-30s by Monday night.

Moving on: The major storm that affected much of the U.S. over the weekend will move off of the East Coast Monday. Heavy rain will diminish over the Mid-Atlantic states throughout the day on Monday

On Sunday, the mercury reached 70 degrees in New York's Central Park, easily eclipsing the previous high of 63 from 1998. Records were also set in Wilmington, Delaware, (67), Atlantic City, New Jersey, (68), and Philadelphia (67). Washington tied its 1889 mark at 72.

The weather is predicted to turn much colder across the East and Midwest in coming days, and after Monday it's likely to dry up.

Most of the snow and rain will end by Monday night. The National Weather Service predicts a 'quiet weather pattern” to return by the middle of the week, but says 'it will remain quite cold across the northern tier states.'

'The country is pretty much in the clear Tuesday through Friday,' says National Weather Service meteorologist Brian Korty. 'People who are traveling shouldn't have significant issues.'
