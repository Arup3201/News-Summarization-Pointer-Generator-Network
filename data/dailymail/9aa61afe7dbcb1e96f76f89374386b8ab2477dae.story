This is the emotional moment a man who was wrongly imprisoned for nearly four decades for murder met and forgave the young witness whose false testimony put him behind bars.

Ricky Jackson, 57, was exonerated in November after spending a staggering 39 years in prison for a crime he did not commit - the robbing and shooting murder of a money-order salesman in 1975.

His conviction at the age of 18 - which led to him being placed on death row, with his sentence later commuted to life  - was largely based on the testimony of a 12-year-old boy named Edward Vernon.

At the time, Vernon claimed under oath that he saw Jackson pull the trigger - even though he was actually several blocks away on a school bus. But in 2013, he went back on his testimony.

Emotional: This is the moment Ricky Jackson - who was wrongly imprisoned for nearly four decades for murder - met and forgave Edward Vernon (right), whose false testimony put him behind bars in 1975

Embrace: Jackson, 57, was exonerated in November after spending a staggering 39 years in prison for a crime he did not commit. His conviction at the age of 18 was largely based on Vernon's testimony as a 12-year-od

A lesson in forgiveness: At the time, Vernon claimed under oath that he saw Jackson pull the trigger - even though he was actually several blocks away on a school bus. But in 2013, he went back on his testimony

Dramatically changing his account, he said: 'All the information was fed to me - I don't have any knowledge about what happened at the scene of the crime.'

Now, following Jackson's release on November 21, the pair have finally met outside of court for the first time in a heart-wrenching encounter that was captured on video by CBS.

In the footage, Jackson beams and holds his hand out as he approaches Vernon, now 52, in a church. Incredibly, he tells him: 'It took a lot of courage to do what you did. Thank you man.'

The pair then warmly embrace and Vernon starts sobbing, telling the former detainee: 'I'm sorry.'

Jackson, dressed in a long blue coat, replies: 'It's all right brother. We were both victims man. It's alright. I do forgive you man. I wanted to be here personally to tell you that.'

Speaking to the broadcaster after their meeting, Vernon, who claims police encouraged him to lie in his testimony, said: 'Wow, how could this man hug and embrace me after all these years?.'

Free at least: Jackson, pictured speaking to CBS this month, nearly seven weeks after his exoneration, told Vernon: 'We were both victims man. It's alright. I do forgive you. I wanted to be here personally to tell you that'

Wrongful conviction: Jackson (pictured, left, in his police mugshot) was convicted of the murder of Harry Franks in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1975. Right, Vernon, now aged 52, later admitted his testimony was 'all lies'

Jackson was convicted of the murder of Harry Franks in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1975, alongside two other men who have both since been exonerated: Wiley Bridgeman, 60, and Kwame Ajamu.

Although at the time, police had no physical evidence to link the trio to the killing, they had testimony from Vernon, who claimed to have seen Jackson shoot Franks with the help of the other two.  

The trio were initially sentenced to death, but their sentences were commuted to life in 1978 after a Supreme Court ruling. They all spent years behind bars at Cuyahoga County Jail.

Indeed, Jackson's sentence was the longest served for a wrongful conviction in U.S history.

Ecstatic: When he exited the courthouse, Jackson said: 'The English language doesn't even fit what I'm feeling'

However, in 2013, Vernon recanted his testimony, saying that police officers coerced him into testifying and gave him details of the case, Cleveland.com reported. 

'They knew that I didn't see anything,' he said. 'Everybody knew it was a lie. All these years I've been holding this shame and guilt inside, wanting to come forward and do the right thing.'

Vernon - whose unreliable testimony was highlighted in an article by Cleveland Scene magazine in 2011 - eventually confided in his pastor, Anthony Singleton.

He said he had initially fingered Jackson because he had seen him around the neighborhood.

When he dismissed Jackson's case in November, Judge Richard McMonagle said, 'Life is filled with small victories, and this is a big one.'

Meanwhile, Jackson said when he exited the courthouse: 'The English language doesn't even fit what I'm feeling. I'm on an emotional high.'

Jackson is now looking forward to his new life as a free man. He has so far applied for a library card and started studying for his driving theory test.

He has also moved into a new home without bars and set mealtimes.
