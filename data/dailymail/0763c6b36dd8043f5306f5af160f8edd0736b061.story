At least 16 people were killed in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo when government troops bombed a building in a rebel-held neighbourhood, activists have said.

The Britain-based activist group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which opposes the regime, said government troops bombarded a building in Aleppo's rebel-held neighborhood of Ansari and killed at least 16 people, including ten children and youths.Â 

Turkey, meanwhile, today pledged its 
continued support for the Syrian opposition, saying its leaders should 
not be pressured into talks with the regime as civil war rages.

The Aleppo Media Center, a network of anti-regime activists in the city, said 20 people were killed in the shelling of Eastern Ansari. An amateur video released by the group showed a building reduced to a pile of debris with dozens of people digging through the rubble in search for survivors.

'The family of the man over there is still under the rubble,' a man could be heard saying, referring to another, standing in the area.

In southern Syria, the Observatory said troops shelled the city of Daraa, the birthplace of the uprising, and killed at least one rebel. The group added that troops shelled the nearby towns of Kahil, Saida and Tel Shehab wounding a number of people.

In other violence in the city, the official SANA news agency said a former parliament member, his wife and two daughters were killed near the Aleppo airport. The report said 'terrorists,' the term the Syrian government uses for rebels, fired at Ibrahim Azzouz's car in Sheik Said neighborhood, killing the family.

Rebels captured the strategic Sheik Said neighborhood south-east of Aleppo on Saturday. It was a significant blow to regime forces because the area includes the road the army has used to supply troops.

Troops loyal to Assad and rebels have been locked in a deadly stalemate in Aleppo, Syria's largest urban center and main commercial hub, since an opposition assault last summer.

Seven months later, the rebels hold large parts of the city and its outskirts, including several army bases. But they have been unable to overcome the regime's far superior firepower.

Turkey has pledged to continue to support the Syrian opposition. Speaking at a security conference in Germany, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said his country supported efforts to end the bloodshed in Syria, but he understood the opposition's refusal to talk to President Bashar Assad after so many Syrian deaths in the fight to topple him.

'It is easy to say now, (the) opposition should accept to sit with the regime, after 60,000 people have been killed,' Davutoglu said at the gathering of top diplomats and security officials in Munich.

'Assuming that tomorrow there is a new election in (Assad's) presence, who will guarantee the safety of the opposition leaders?' Davutoglu said.

Opposition leaders categorically refused any talks with Damascus until Assad steps down. In a sharp departure from their resolve, the coalition's president, Moaz al-Khatib, said Wednesday he is willing to talk to the regime if that would help end bloodshed.

Like the United States and its Western allies, Turkey has repeatedly called on Assad to step down. Assad brushed the calls aside, outlining a peace proposal last month that would put him in charge of national reconciliation talks.

Russia, Assad's most important international ally, said the insistence on his ouster before political talks can begin was counterproductive. Another staunch supporter of Damascus, Iran, said Tehran would welcome the opposition leaders to talks.

'Iran has talked to the opposition,' Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi said in Munich. 'We are ready to be part of the solution,' he insisted. 'The sooner that we resolve the issue, the better it is.'

Syrian television broadcast images of what it said was the aftermath of an Israeli airstrike on a research facility near Damascus earlier this week, showing destroyed vehicles and moderate damage to a building.

Israel has not publicly acknowledged Wednesday's airstrike that US officials said had hit a convoy of anti-aircraft weapons inside Syria bound for the militant Lebanese Hezbollah group.

The Syrian military said the target of the Israeli jets was a scientific research centre in the area of Jamraya, north-west of Damascus.

The strike raised tensions between Israel and its neighbour Syria, which is engulfed by the raging civil war.

The first purported images of the targeted site, aired by Al-Ikhbariya TV on Saturday, show the twisted and battered remnants of cars, trucks and military vehicles.

Destruction: Today's airstrike, in the Aleppo neighbourhood of Ansari, destroyed a building and killed at least 16 people

Search: People try to recover victims from among the rubble following the devastating blast

Neighbourhood: The full devastating effects of the bomb can be seen as people stand among the rubble and the dust

Victim: A man is taken away on a stretcher as residents continue to hunt for survivors

A building has broken widows and damaged interiors, but no major structural damage. The caption says, 'Consequences of the Israeli aggression on the Jamraya centre'. State TV also ran footage of the damage.

Syria's regime vowed revenge for the airstrike while the rebels battling president Bashar Assad criticised him for not responding to what they termed Israeli aggression.

According to a US official, the strike targeted trucks containing SA-17 anti-aircraft missiles. The trucks were next to the research centre the Syrians identified and the strikes hit both the trucks and the facility.

Advanced anti-aircraft missiles like the SA-17 in the hands of Hezbollah could change the strategic equation, which so far has allowed Israel to send warplanes over Lebanon practically unopposed.

The Syrian military denied that the target of the attack was a weapons convoy. It said low-flying Israeli jets crossed into the country over the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights to target the Jamraya centre.

Until Wednesday, Israel has been reluctant to do anything that would seem an intervention into Syrian civil war.

The airstrike adds another layer to the complexity of the Syrian conflict that has left the international community at a loss for ways to end bloodshed.

The uprising against president Assad began in March 2011 with largely peaceful pro-reform protests and developed into a civil war which the United Nations says has killed more than 60,000 people.

The Syrian government maintains that there is no uprising in Syria but a conspiracy against the country because of its support for anti-Israeli groups.
