To commemorate the contribution of British and Commonwealth servicemen and women in the two world wars and later conflicts, a British Airways 747 has been adorned with a giant poppy.

The 8ft by 8ft tribute was seen on the aircraft as it flew to New York's John F Kennedy Airport today on an 8.20am flight, to mark Armistice Day.

British Airways asked customers and colleagues to observe a two-minute silence to mark Armistice Day at 11am and did the same for Remembrance Sunday.

The poppy is an excellent tribute to the servicemen who lost their lives in warfare 

British Airways Senior First Officer Dheeraj Bhasin, said: 'I served for 17 years in the RAF, so I am proud that British Airways is right behind the Poppy Appeal.

'The airline is showing its support in lots of ways. British Airways teams are collecting donations alongside servicemen and women in Terminal 5 at Heathrow, observing the silences on Remembrance Sunday and Armistice Day and have displayed a giant Poppy on one of our Boeing 747s.

'The support British Airways is giving is extremely important, not least of all, to the hundreds of men and women who have served their country, as well as current reservists in roles across the airline.'

Mr Bhasin has been flying for British Airways for seven years and has flown the Airbus 320, the Boeing 777, and is currently flying the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. 

Before joining British Airways Bhasin served for 17 years in the RAF and he still serves in the reserve forces as a flying instructor and military skills instructor for cadets and reservists.

During both periods, British Airways pilots at UK airports did not start aircraft engines.

Keith Williams, British Airways' executive chairman, said: 'We are honoured to pay our own tribute to the millions who have fought for their country during the last 100 years.

'We believe this will help deliver the spirit of remembrance to countries around the world and support the great work that takes place through The Royal British Legion's Poppy Appeal.'

The design and placing of the poppy was done entirely in house by the BA engineering team.

A spokesperson for the airline added: 'As far as we are aware, the design of the poppy has been really well received by all who seen it.'

The plane flew out from Heathrow to the George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas on Saturday, returning back to London early Sunday morning.

An afternoon flight was next on the agenda for the specially-designed aircraft as it flew to John F Kennedy International Airport in New York, returning on Monday.

And the Boeing 747 flew back to JFK on Monday. Today, on Armistice Day, the plane flew out again to JFK at 8.20am.
