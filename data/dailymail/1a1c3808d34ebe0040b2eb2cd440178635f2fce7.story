US officials have reportedly told Israel to stop killing off Iranian nuclear scientists.

Israel Moussad spy agancy has supposedly taken out at least five top Iranian nuclear experts in an attempt to slow the country’s nuclear program and continues to do so despite recent agreements reached to end the country’s nuclear ambitions.

The brazen hits were carried out using mostly car bombs, and the assassins were never captured, CBS News revealed Sunday in a shocking report as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu flew to Washington.

Let's make a deal: President Barack Obama meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last year in the Oval Office - Obama is pressuring Israel to stop killing Iranian Nuclear experts and focus on ironing out differences with Palestine

Israel has never publicly acknowledged the program, according to the report, but it was designed to slow the rogue nation’s nuclear progress, as well as ‘deter trained and educated Iranians from joining their country's nuclear program.’

The Moussad operatives were able to get away with the killings as a result of an extensive network of safe houses within the Islamic state, ‘although several Iranians who may have helped the Mossad were arrested and executed,’ CBS claimed.

An unidentified US official disclosed the program to CBS while claiming the Obama administration is leaning on its Middle Eastern ally to stop the targeted killings and wait for the current deal to disarm to play out.

That has forced Netanyahu to redirect Moussad’s efforts towards finding proof Iran is cheating on the historic agreement.

Agents are scouring the country looking for evidence, but have yet to find any.

Netanyahu’s visit to the US capital is also expected to touch upon Israel – Palestine peace talks, and where the two nations stand on Jewish settlements in the West Bank.

Palestine wants borders reset to the pre-1967 Isreali invasion lines, something Netanyahu signaled shortly before taking off is a non-starter.

This hard line has forced the US to dial back expectations of a firm deal from next month to later this year.
