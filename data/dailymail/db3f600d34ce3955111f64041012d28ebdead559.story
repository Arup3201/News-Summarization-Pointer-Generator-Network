Scotland Yard is investigating  a suspected arson attack that took place at the Houses of Parliament, The Mail on Sunday has discovered.

Detectives believe a fire that broke out close to offices in the southern end of the House of Lords may have been started deliberately. 

They are also looking at a series of other incidents involving damage to computers during the recess, when most MPs are away on holiday.

The investigation has prompted fears that a vengeful employee may be waging a campaign of criminal damage.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘Police are investigating other incidents of damage in the same building, but are yet to determine  if these are linked to the fire.’

Last summer a small blaze broke out in the House of Commons, closing areas of the Parliament temporarily. 

Sources said at the time there was no significant 
damage but areas were being cordoned off because of the potential danger
 from toxic substances such as asbestos.

In March Labour leader Ed Miliband was left shaken after his House of Commons office was mysteriously broken into.

Intruders suspiciously left money and valuable objects untouched, but ransacked papers and forced a drawer open after breaking down the office's front door.
