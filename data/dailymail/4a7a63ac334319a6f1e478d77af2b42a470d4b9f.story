Fiji prop Campese Ma'afu has received a one-week ban after being sent off in last Saturday's Millennium Stadium clash against Wales.

The Nottingham forward was dismissed by French referee Pascal Gauzere on receipt of a second yellow card.

Ma'afu appeared before an independent Six Nations disciplinary committee in London on Tuesday.

'The disciplinary committee, chaired by Jeremy Summers along with Dan White (both England), having viewed footage of the two incidents and listened to representations by and on behalf of the player, imposed a sanction of a one-week suspension,' read a statement, released by the Autumn International Disciplinary.

'The sanction imposed reflected the persistent nature of the offending, rather than the substance of the offences themselves.' 

Ma'afu is free to resume playing next Monday. He will miss Fiji's Test against the United States later this week.
