Los Angeles Lakers superstar Kobe Bryant has scored a victory in an ongoing legal battle with his own mother, who planned to auction off more than a million dollars’ worth of his sports memorabilia.

This week, a judge issued a temporary restraining order against Goldin Auctions barring the auction house from selling Bryant's basketball jerseys, jackets, high school championship rings, trophies and other collectibles pending a full hearing.

The New Jersey-based auction business has filed a complaint claiming that Bryant's mother, Pamela Bryant, put up for sale a large collection of sports memorabilia, which she had received as a gift from her millionaire son. The items numbering in the hundreds were expected to fetch around $1.5million.

He said, she said: Kobe Bryant (left) insisted that his mother (right) was never given consent to take his collectibles and sell them, but Pamela Bryant claims her son had given her permission to auction them off

Earlier this year, Mrs Bryant joined forces with the Berlin, New Jersey-based Goldin Auctions to sell the sports mementos from her son's high school days and early NBA career.

In return, Pamela Bryant received a $450,000 advance, which she in turn used to buy a house in Nevada.

However, the 34-year-old athlete, who is currently recovering from a season-ending injury to his Achilles’ tendon, filed his own complaint against the auction house insisting that he had never given his mother permission to sell his memorabilia.

Mr Bryant went on to stay in his court filing that his mother stole some of his personal items from his house, TMZ reported.

'I never told my mother that she could have my personal property, let alone consign it for public auction,' Bryant wrote.

According to the complaint filed Wednesday in US District Court in Camden, New Jersey, the Lakers shooting guard claimed that Mrs Bryant admitted to him recently that she was never given consent to sell his possessions.

'I confronted her about her false 
statement that I had given my memorabilia to her,' Bryant wrote in the filing cited by ESPN. 'I said
to her, "Mom, you know I never told you that you could have the 
memorabilia."

'Her response 
was, "Yes, but you never said you wanted it, either." Of course, this is
untrue, since my wife and I requested that she return my memorabilia 
several years earlier.'

Last
week, Kobe Bryant's lawyers demanded that Goldin Auctions scrap the 
scheduled June sale. In response, the auction house sued the athlete for
the right to go ahead with the sale of The Kobe Bryant Collection.

Mr
Bryant has emphasized that he was only suing the auctioneers and not 
his mother, but both he and his wife, Vanessa, had testified in writing 
that Pamela Bryant took the memorabilia and put it on the auction block 
without their permission, and then refused to return the prized 
possessions.

Bryant said in
a sworn statement that the items at the center of the dispute  go back 
to his teenage years have 'tremendous sentimental value,' adding that he
was planning to hand down his 'well-deserved memorabilia’  to his 
children, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. 

Bryant said his mother can claim ownership of only two items, NBA Championship rings that he had custom-made for his parents.

Deal: A lawsuit by the New Jersey auction house claims that Kobe Bryant's mother Pamela Bryant, seen beside his father Joe Bryant, already struck a deal with them for the items' sale

Vanessa
Bryant also weighed in on the mother-son spat, stating that when 
confronted about the items, her mother-in-law agreed to return theme, 
but said that she had moved all the jerseys and championship mementos to
a storage facility.

Attorneys for both sides in the legal dispute will present their arguments in the case May 20 in Camden.

The disagreement is a high-value, 
high-profile version of a question many families face: Can Mom get rid 
of the stuff a grown child left at home?

In this case, the 900 mementos happen to be worth upward of $1.5 million.

Among
the first 100 or so items Pamela Bryant intends to sell: the NBA star's
jerseys, practice gear and sweatsuits from Lower Merion High School; 
varsity letters; a trophy for being the outstanding player at the 1995 
Adidas ABCD basketball camp; and a signed basketball from the 2000 NBA 
championship game.

And
then there are rings, for the 1996 Pennsylvania high school 
championship, a pair that the Lakers made for Bryant's parents for the 
2000 NBA championship and one from the 1998 NBA All-Star game.

According
to court filings, Pamela Bryant struck a deal in January with Goldin 
Auctions in Berlin, N.J., which earlier this year sold a rare Honus 
Wagner baseball card for a record $2.1 million.

In its court filings, Goldin says 
Pamela Bryant told the auction house that she asked her son five years 
ago what he wanted to do with the items that were in her home.

'Kobe Bryant indicated to Pamela 
Bryant that the items belonged to her and that he had no interest in 
them,' the auction house's attorneys wrote. So she put them in a 
$1,500-per-month New Jersey storage unit.

Price tag: The 900 items belonging to Bryant, seen with his wife Vanessa at a cancer research benefit on Thursday, could bring in upward of $1.5 million

The challenge came last Tuesday when Goldin sent a news release announcing the auction. By day's end, Kobe Bryant's lawyer had sent a cease-and-desist letter telling the auction house to call off the sale and return the items to him.

Kenneth Goldin, owner of the auction house, says he can't cancel the auction because he's already advanced $450,000 to Bryant's mother and put money into advertising the auction.

Kobe Bryant's lawyer Mark Campbell said in a statement, 'Mr. Bryant's personal property has ended up in the possession of someone who does not lawfully own it. We look forward to resolving this legal matter through the legal system.'

Bryant has had a sometimes icy relationship with his mother and father, Joe 'Jellybean' Bryant, a former pro basketball player for the Philadelphia 76ers who is now coaching in Thailand.
