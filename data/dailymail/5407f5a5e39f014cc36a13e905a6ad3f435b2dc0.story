There's no better wake-up call than a steaming cup of fresh coffee – but first thing in the morning, just getting out of bed to make it can be a challenge.

Luckily, help is at hand from a gadget that grinds the beans, brews them and pours out a hot drink tailored to your taste, all at a swipe of a smartphone.

Just tap a single button in the mobile app that comes with the coffee-maker, then stay snug under the covers as it gets to work.

The Wi-Fi Coffee Machine by Smarter can be triggered, via a smartphone, to not only make you a hot drink tailored to your individual taste, it can have it ready for you before you even wake up. Once it has ground the beans and boiled the water to a precise temperature, it will send an alarm to your phone to rouse you

Alternatively, the machine can be set to make coffee at the same time each day. When it is ready, it sends an alarm to the owner’s phone to wake them. The system can also welcome people home at the end of the day with an offer to brew up.

The Wi-Fi Coffee Machine, by British firm Smarter, is part of a technological revolution that entrepreneurs say will create smart homes full of appliances run wirelessly from a home hub.

Everything from heating to lighting, the washing machine to the TV, the oven and the lock on your front door will be controlled through smartphones that link into a home wi-fi system or the internet.

Initially, people would have to tap in their commands, but experts are already working on voice controls via iPhones or Android mobiles.

Smarter’s coffee machine will go on sale in Britain in March, at a cost of £129. It makes the drink from scratch, grinding the beans and boiling water using set recipes that can be tweaked to suit the owner’s taste. It can even alert you when it needs refilling.

Smarter also sells the £99 iKettle, controlled in the same way.

Its founder, Christian Lane, said: ‘We want to create the perfect morning experience. When you get up in the morning there is a fine line between a good day and a bad day, which starts when you wake up.’

He told tech website SlashGear that the coffee-maker will work with a range of other devices, including smart wristbands that monitor your sleep.

This means the technology will be able to identify if you have slept badly – and suggest a really strong cup of coffee to give you a much-needed caffeine boost.

The machine was launched yesterday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where the world’s leading tech firms are showing off their brightest ideas. Alongside smart equipment for the home, the show features a raft of wearable devices designed to give users a virtual health check, measuring heart rate, activity level and sleep patterns – and then devising food and exercise regimes to help improve well-being.

Other new arrivals at the show include new super-slim, super-bright curved screen TVs.

÷Audi is sending one of its cars on a 550-mile solo journey from San Francisco to Las Vegas to prove that driverless vehicles could soon be an everyday reality.

The German auto-giant says its ‘piloted driving’ equipment is ‘production ready’ and could go on sale next year. The A7, which is codenamed Jack, uses radar, laser scanners and cameras to survey its surroundings. When it reaches Las Vegas, it will go on display at the CES show. 

The new smart coffee machine has been created by tech experts at London-based Smarter, which already makes a smart iKettle (pictured) that is controlled in the same way, and is sold for £99 ($150) by Apple stores and John Lewis. The machines are on display at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas
