Anyone who studies for a PhD can expect it to involve a lot of hard work.

But few students can claim to have completed an assignment as tough as this - catching a crocodile bigger than a car.

Luke Evans, of Penwith, Cornwall, was part of a 12-man team which caught the animal - the largest crocodile ever to be tagged and released back into the wild.

The crocodile, called Siganas, is 5.2m long, weighs more than a ton and was caught in Kinabatangan, near the Sabah region of Malaysian Borneo.

Mr Evans, 24, travelled to the country to study saltwater crocodiles and to trap and tag them with sat-nav technology so that scientists can follow their movements.

The scheme is a joint project involving three organisations - the State Wildlife department, the Danau Girang Field Centre (DGFC) and Chester Zoo.

Mr Evans and fellow volunteers dragged the male crocodile to shore and held it down while it was tagged. The animal was then released.

Experts believe Siganas is the largest tagged crocodile in the world.

Effort: Twelve volunteers were involved in the operation to haul the crocodile ashore for tagging

Massive: The crocodile, called Signas, is 5.2m long, weighs more than a ton and was caught in the Kinabatangan River, near the Sabah region of Malaysian Borneo

Two other crocodiles have been tagged as part of the project - in June last year and in January - but they were smaller and scientists were only able to monitor them for about two months each.

Mr Evans said: 'When we first saw the crocodile, it was in a trap and it was clear to me that it was going to measure more than five metres.

'The feeling was pure excitement. These are the kind of days that make me love my PhD.

'It's the third crocodile we have tagged in the Kinabatangan River in Sabah and this one was considerably larger than the other two.

'It eclipses the previous record of 4.65 metres, carried out in Australia.

'We
 hope that by mapping the reptile's nesting locations, it will show us 
how habitats decline and how human intervention is affecting the 
reptile's behaviour.'

Team leader Mark Rampangajouw said: 'We needed more than 10 men to pull Siganas out of the trap and carry it to the river bank where we measured it and collared the satellite tag on its neck.

'It was teamwork and we enjoyed the challenge.'

Datuk Dr Laurentius Ambu, State Wildlife director, said: 'We were a bit unlucky with the two previous males tagged in June last year, and January, with the tags lasting for only two months.

'Hopefully, this tag will last longer and will provide important data on the crocodile's movements and home ranges.'

DGFC director Dr Benoit Goossens said there were plans to tag several more crocodiles.

He said: 'In three days, Siganas had already travelled 5km and moved away from DGFC. It seems to be a transient reptile, rather than a resident.'

Project: A director of the Danau Girang Field Centre said there were plans to tag several more crocodiles

Research: Scientists hope that, by mapping the reptile's nesting locations, they will learn how habitats decline
