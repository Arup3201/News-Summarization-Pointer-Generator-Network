It is a unique view of the Las Vegas strip - and one that resembles the hit move The Matrix rather than the Hangover, usually associated with the strip.

Air force pilots from the US, UK and Australia descended on Las Vegas this week for a military exercise that has run since 1975 to test  tactics, planes and pilots.

Called red flag,  this year it included aircraft and personnel from 21 different U.S. military squadrons, as well as the Royal Australian Air Force and the United Kingdom's Royal Air Force. 

The view from a Royal Australian air force C-130J Super Hercules, assigned to 37 Squadron, Richmond, Australia, lands after a training mission during Red Flag 15-1 at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada on February 9th 2015. Since its establishment in 1975, Red Flag has played host to military units from more than 30 countries.

Red Flag is the Air Force's premier air-to-air combat training exercise, and was first run in 1975. 

Participants often include both US and allied nations' combat air forces. 

The exercise gives pilots the experience of mulitple, intensive air combat sorties in the safety of a training environment. 

'Red Flag still accomplishes the original objective it set out to in 1975,' said Lt. Col. John Stratton, 493rd Fighter Squadron commander. 

'It provides realistic training to make our force more survivable in combat.'

What makes Red Flag so relevant and important, he said, is that it has evolved commensurate with real world operations and threats.

'Red Flag deliberately incorporates lessons learned from real world operations, past Red Flags, weapons school training, and changes to meet the needs of the combat air forces and the war fighters,' he said. 

'They've developed a variety of extremely difficult scenarios that build on each other from day to day so we aren't going out to execute the same mission over and over again.'

Those scenarios aren't simply challenges for fighter pilots. 

Cyber and space operators have been included in the Red Flag exercises for nearly a decade, and Air Force Space Command elements were fully integrated in 2011 at the tactical level, from planning through execution and debrief, according to a 24th Air Force Public Affairs release.

Col Brian Dudas, Red Flag 15-1 Air Expeditionary Wing Commander and 48th Fighter Wing Vice Commander, said deployment and defense of assets across each element -- air, space and cyberspace -- is critical to the modern warfighter.

'In the 1970's, when Red Flag began, much of the technology we rely on today was still developing, and wasn't yet part of day-to-day employment,' he said. 'Today, everything overlaps across the domains, and they continue to evolve. Cyber warfare absolutely affects our capabilities, and defense of space in the future will be very important.'

Red Flag, Dudas said, is the pinnacle of training environments.

Called red flag, this year it included aircraft and personnel from 21 different U.S. military squadrons, including the An F-15 Eagle seen here, as well as the Royal Australian Air Force and the United Kingdom's Royal Air Force.

'When our crews, maintainers, cyber operators, and air operations center and support personnel leave this exercise, they will all have been pushed to their own limits. They will understand just how crucial their own performance and success is to the success of the entire mission,' he said.

'Nowhere else will you find such a coordinated environment to test every aspect of our warfighting capabilities. Nowhere else will you find such a well-trained team dedicated purely to replicating the best of the threats, challenges and issues we may face in combat operations,' he said.

Dudas, who has attended nine Red Flags in 20 years, said the ultimate reason we train and operate with our allies at complex flag exercises is to improve our performance and prepare for those real-world operations.

'In today's world, the likelihood of going to combat without our sister services, allies, and partners is almost nil,' he said. 'Therefore, we want to maximize our opportunities to push our own limits alongside those warriors with whom we will fight when called upon.'

Dudas said he's seen the level of international integration improve dramatically since his first Red Flag experience as a B-1B co-pilot in 1995.

'We used to spend the entire time trying to figure out how each other spoke, in different terminologies. It took time to learn how to best communicate and interact,' he said. Now we walk in on the same page, ready to fight. We already speak a common tactical language.'

The relationships built and strengthened here will pay huge dividends in future combat operations, Dudas said.

'It's that much less time we'll need to spend getting familiar with how we operate separately, he said, 'since we've already done this tough exercise as one cohesive warfighting team.'
