A former Apple CEO who it is claimed fired Steve Jobs in the 1980s from the company he founded has admitted he made a mistake - and said he wished he had hired him back.

John Sculley, who clashed with Jobs during his ten year tenure at the tech giant, said he thought that bringing back Jobs could have avoided the firm's disastrous performance in the 1990s.

'I wish in hindsight I had reached back to Steve and told him, 'I want to help you come back to Apple,'' Sculley told CNNMoney.

Accusations: John Sculley, left, allegedly fired Apple founder Steve Jobs, right, from his own company - but now said he wished he had hired him back.

'I wish Apple had hired him back sooner rather than later.'

Sculley's ten-year career at Apple saw some of its least successful products - including an iPad forerunner called Newton - and is viewed as a decline ahead of its resurgence in recent years.

Sculley has previously spoken about his sometimes-fractious relationship with Jobs, which came to a head in a dispute over the pricing of the Apple Macintosh computer.

Jobs wanted it to be cheap to drive sales and interest, while Sculley wanted to keep the price higher to protect its other products and defend the company's bottom line.

Sculley, who also defended his tenure at the company, said in 2012: '[Apple] was the most profitable computer company in the world - not just personal computers - and Apple was the number one selling computer.

'So the myth that I fired Steve wasn't true and the myth that I destroyed Apple, that wasn't true either.'

Sculley was finally forced out of Apple in 1993 over a dispute about licensing Macintosh's software to other PC makers. 

The board was in favour of letting other computer makers use Apple's software, but Sculley was opposed.

Apple did end up licensing its software, which turned out to be a major mistake.

By the time Apple hired Steve Jobs back in 1997, the company was posting giant losses.

Had Sculley mended his differences with Jobs sooner and brought him back to Apple during his tenure, he says the company wouldn't have been in such dire straits in the late 1990's.

'When Steve came back, the first thing he did was to cancel the licensing,' Sculley said. 

'At that point, only Steve Jobs could have revived the business. There's no way I could have ever done the things Steve Jobs did.'

Sculley reserved his biggest compliments for current Apple CEO Tim Cook, who Sculley says is 'exactly the right guy' for the job.

'I say that without any reservation,' Sculley told CNN.

'Tim is doing a brilliant job.'

Sculley was recently accused of hiding his fortune during a divorce battle .

He allegedly signed over investments worth $25million to his brothers to avoid them being claimed by Carol 'Leezy' Sculley.

Sculley, who spent ten years at the helm of the tech company, finalized his divorce in 2011, having claimed their combined worth was just $4.8million, Page Six reported.

But his ex-wife claims that he had in fact been squirreling away assets more than a decade in advance, after starting an affair with a former Apple colleague in 2000.

According to filings from 2013 seen by Page Six, Sculley asked his brothers Arthur and David to take on assets for him by starting a joint investment firm called Sculley Brothers - charges Sculley denies.

The filing, made in Palm Beach, Florida, in 2013, accuses Sculley of lying to court. It then alleges he 'submitted a false financial affidavit . . . and failed to fully and honestly disclose his assets.'

Those assets are later described as 'substantial private equity investments and investments in privately held companies and ventures around the globe'.

Some estimates say that Sculley is worth as much as $200million in total. 

However, a representative for Sculley refuted the claims.

He told DailyMail.com: 'The reality is that this case has been in the court of law for a number of years, and leaking false items to the media in a desire to pressure Mr. Sculley into settling this case is despicable.

'There is zero truth to these allegations. Mr. Sculley is confident this case will result in a full vindication for him.'
