For most chefs, winning a Michelin star would be the icing on the cake of culinary achievement.

But Skye Gyngell has quit her London restaurant, claiming that the prestigious award had become a curse.

Miss Gyngell, 47, had been head chef at Petersham Nurseries Cafe since it opened in 2004 and picked up the Michelin accolade last year.

Too much pressure: Skye Gyngell removed the star from the restaurant¿s website and said she hoped she would never be awarded another

The quirky cafe, set in a greenhouse 
near Richmond Park, enjoyed a celebrity following which had included 
Madonna, Richard E Grant, Mick Jagger and Stella McCartney.

Shortly before leaving, Miss Gyngell 
removed the star from the restaurant’s website and said she hoped she 
would never be awarded another.

She said the establishment struggled 
to meet diners’ expectations of a Michelin-starred restaurant such as 
starched linen, matching glasses, and slick service. She said of the 
award: ‘It’s been a curse.

That probably sounds very ungrateful. 
Since we got the star we’ve been crammed every single day, which is 
really hard for such a tiny restaurant. And we’ve had lots more 
complaints.

‘People have certain expectations of a
Michelin restaurant. You know, if you’re used to eating at Marcus 
Wareing then they feel let down when they come here.’

Miss Gyngell, the 
author of three acclaimed cookbooks, is a former drug addict and the 
daughter of Australian media mogul Bruce Gyngell, who is famous for 
rescuing ITV breakfast show TV-am.

Celebrities including Madonna, Richard E Grant, Mick Jagger and Stella McCartney are fans of the food's focus on simple flavours

She said it was ‘amazing’ Michelin had
relaxed its rules on table linen and toilets to reach out to places 
like Petersham with its rickety tables, and ‘loos in a wooden shed’.

But its focus on producing fresh, 
seasonal food from quality ingredients was not enough to satisfy all the
new customers used to more traditional fine dining, she lamented.

Some complained that it only offered one cheese, she said.

Miss Gyngell took the star off the 
website to stop people complaining. ‘This is the worst thing I’m going 
to say – if I ever have another restaurant I pray we don’t get a star.’

Miss Gyngell, a single mother, born in Sydney, has been married twice, 
and has two daughters aged 22 and 15. She joined Petersham having moved 
to the suburbs after running high-pressure kitchens in Mayfair and 
Paris.

Fellow Australian Greg Malouf, who 
previously ran modern Middle Eastern restaurant Mo Mo in Melbourne, has 
been appouinted as her successor.

Petersham opened in 2004 with one 
table that seated ten and Miss Gyngell bringing her pots and pans from 
home. It now serves 120 per sitting.

At the time of the award in January 
last year, Miss Gyngell had declared her accolade to be ‘fantastic’, 
adding: ‘To be rewarded for all our hard work is absolutely amazing.’

A spokesman for Petersham said: ‘We 
can confirm that after eight years of success in leading the team, Skye 
Gyngell is off to pursue other interests. We wish her every success.’
