Danah Vince, 20, from Bristol was found dead a year after she was cleared of causing or allowing the death of her baby, Paris

A young mother whose boyfriend was jailed for shaking their 16-week old baby to death - killed herself after being 'hounded and harassed' after the court case, her family have claimed.

Danah Vince, 20, from Bristol was cleared of causing or allowing the death of her daughter, Paris, after she was found with 'catastrophic' head injuries.

But the baby's father William Stephens, 25, was convicted of manslaughter and jailed for six years after he was found guilty of shaking the baby so hard she was bleeding from her eyes.

Ms Vince's family have claimed that she was tormented by locals following the trial and killed herself one year later just hours after she was punched by three girls at a pub.

Her mother Lisa, 40, said: 'A lot of people would be horrible to her in the street. They would be mean to her and she would also get threats and insults.

'She was harassed which meant that she started to stay in a lot rather than go out. It was obvious there were people who were never going to let it go away.

'There was also a lot of horrible stuff about her on the internet. People would say mean things to her and send nasty messages.' 

During the trial at Bristol Crown Court, the jury heard the young parents had a 'volatile' on-off relationship and social services became involved.

Stephens was subject to a restraining order banning him from contacting Ms Vince, but the court was told he was still living with her and Paris at the time of her death.

The thug - who had learning difficulties and an IQ in the low 50s - is thought to have lost control and shaken crying Paris while Ms Vince was out of the house, causing a fatal brain bleed in January 2013.

Paris Vince-Stephens was just 16 weeks old when she was shaken so violenty by her father she died

He was said to have become 'agitated' after running out of cannabis and later admitted that he 'slightly shook' the baby.

Medics at Bristol Children's Hospital fought to save her for two days, and experts said her injuries were either caused by shaking or banging her head against a soft surface - or a combination of both.

Despite walking free from court, her family claim Ms Vince was taunted via online messages, and when she returned to the Bear and Rugged Staff pub in Southmead, Bristol, she was attacked.

Hours after the assault in November last year and almost a year after she was cleared of her daughter's death - she was found dead in her new home.

Her father DJ, 41, said: 'I spoke to Danah on the Friday night when it happened. She was going out to the pub for a drink and she seemed fine, she seemed quite happy.

'I heard that three girls picked on her in the pub and intimidated her. She was pushed around and punched. That was the weekend she died.

'At the end of the day she was found not guilty and Williams was sent to prison for killing Paris. When the trial was over she made a real effort to rebuild her life.

'No one is saying that Danah is an angel. She had her problems like anyone else. But she would never have harmed her baby.

'She was a good mother and would have done anything for her daughter.

'There was a lot of stuff said about her in court but it was just not true.' 

Her family claim some of the accusations made about Ms Vince in court were false - including allegations she blew cannabis smoke into Paris' cot to keep her quiet

Her family claim some of the accusations made about Ms Vince  in court were false - including allegations she blew cannabis smoke into Paris' cot to keep her quiet.

'There were a lot of lies told about Danah in the court and there are a lot of people out there who just refuse to listen to the truth,' said her father.

'She was at her happiest when she was with Paris and she loved that baby. The problem was she kept letting Stephens come back into her life.'

Her mother said that Ms Vince had tried to get her life back on track and had taken parenting classes. 

'When Danah was found not guilty she was determined to get on with her life and make something of herself,' she said. 

'After the court case she moved out of Southmead and took parenting classes. She tried to stay away from the people being horrible to her.

'The problem was all her family and friends are in the area so it was really tough for her.

Ms Vince's  death is being investigated by the coroner and an inquest is expected to be held later this year.
