Barack Obama pointedly refused to call ISIS terrorists Muslims today as he spoke at a joint press conference with British Prime Minister David Cameron.

Standing just a few feet away, Cameron warned of a global 'Islamist extremist terrorist threat,' condemning the perversion of Islam in the strongest possible terms three times and using the word 'poisonous' to describe the radicalized ideology five times.

Keeping with his administration's policy to label foreign fighters as 'terrorists,' Obama would not refer to the religion of ISIS militants during the White House news conference but at one point called them 'fanatics.'

Obama said the world must 'lift up those voices that represent the vast majority of the Muslim world' and push a counter narrative as 'aggressively and as nimbly as the messages coming' from the radicals.

U.S. President Barack Obama, right, and British Prime Minister David Cameron, left, hold a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House, in Washington, D.C. on Friday afternoon. Cameron repeatedly referred to radicalized Islam as a 'poisonous' ideology but Obama wouldn't imply religion was a motivating factor of terrorists

'This phenomenon has violent roots, the ideology, the networks,' Obama said of ISIS. 'This has metastasized and it is widespread and it has penetrated communities around the world'

Their Washington, D.C., news conference came after a working dinner on Thursday evening and a meeting in the Oval Office this morning.

The U.S. President said in his opening remarks that the coalition against ISIS is 'systematically taking out their fighters,' and he looked forward to hosting Britain at terror summit in February.

In his own statement Cameron told reporters, 'We face a poisonous and fanatical ideology that wants to pervert Islam.'

'We do face a very serious Islamist extremist terrorist threat in Europe, in America, across the world. And we have to be incredibly vigilant in terms of that threat,' he later said. 

Cameron said the world must focus on breaking down the 'poisonous radical death cult of a narrative' that's corrupting the Islamic religion. That is 'the heart of the matter' he said.

It must also avoid creating 'safe havens for terrorists to otherwise talk to each other.'

Obama said the U.S. and his allies were working to identify terrorist actors in Syria and deactivate them.

'This phenomenon has violent roots, the ideology, the networks,' he said. 'This has metastasized and it is widespread and it has penetrated communities around the world.'

The U.S. President said he does not consider the threat from ISIS an 'existential' one, and like Cameron, he believe is one 'that we will solve.'

'We are stronger. We are representing values that the vast majority of Muslims believe in, in tolerance, and in working together to build rather than destroy, and so this is a problem that causes great heartache and tragedy and destruction,' he said. 

'But it is one that ultimately we're going to defeat.'

Obama said that weapons alone would do the job, and that he and Cameron discussed during their meeting how to 'lift up those voices that represent the vast majority of the Muslim world so that this counter narrative against this nihilism is put out there as aggressively and as nimbly as the messages coming out from these fanatics.'

'How do we make sure that we are working with local communities and faith leaders, and families' whether in Great Britain or the U.S., he said, 'so that we're inoculating ourselves against this kind of ideology.

'That's gonna be slow, plotting, systematic work,' Obama noted, but it's work he's 'confident' the U.S. can achieve it, 'especially with partners like the United Kingdom.'

Obama also suggested that the U.S. had an 'advantage' over countries like Britain when it comes to fighting terrorism because 'our Muslim populations, they feel themselves to be Americans.'

'There is this incredible process of immigration and assimilation that is part of our tradition. That is probably our greatest strength,' he said.

Cameron and Obama were just coming off of a meeting a working dinner on Thursday evening followed by an Oval Office meeting this morning

Obama said that during their meeting, he talked with Cameron about his views that the world must 'lift up those voices that represent the vast majority of the Muslim world' and push a counter narrative as 'aggressively and as nimbly as the messages coming' from the radicals 

The White House has actively refused to describe Islamic radicals fighting in Iraq and Syria for a caliphate in religious terms.

'Let’s call them what they are,' Obama's spokesman said on Tuesday. 'These terrorists are individuals who would like to cloak themselves in the veil of a particular religion. 

'But based on the fact that the religious leaders of that religion have roundly condemned their actions, those religious leaders have indicated that their actions are entirely inconsistent with Islam,' he said.

Earnest said the fact that the 'majority of victims of terror attacks' are Muslim 'is a pretty clear indication that this is not a matter of the world being at war with Islam.'

'The world and the United States...is at war with these individuals, these violent extremists who carry out these acts of terror and try to justify it by invoking this religion.' he stated.

The U.S. official admitted that unlike other Western leaders, including French President Francois Hollande, Obama's administration was purposefully avoiding use of the term 'radical Islam.'

One reason, he said, is that, he 'wouldn’t want to be in a position where I’m repeating the justification that they have cited that I think is completely illegitimate.'

'These are individuals who are terrorists,''] he again said. 'And what they did was they tried to invoke their own distorted deviant view of Islam to try to justify them. 

'And I think that is completely illegitimate. And what we should do is we should call it what it is. And it’s an act of terror, and it’s one that we roundly condemn.'
