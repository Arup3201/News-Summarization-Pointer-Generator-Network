The build-up lasts for weeks, thousands of dollars will be spent on the final day and agony and ecstasy will be felt in equal measure by football fans across the country when the Super Bowl XLVII champion is crowned on Sunday.

But if you feel you've endured enough suffering for the football season finale - let alone the entire season - there is bad news, there may be even more to come.

Psychiatrists have warned medical 'withdrawal' symptoms will be felt by fans across the country on Sunday night - leaving thousands in an off-season funk due to a chemical imbalance in the brain left by the love of the game.

Feeling blue: A psychiatry expert from Chicago has warned some football fans will need to be eased out of the season following Sunday's Super Bowl

So for health reasons alone, Dr. Angelos Halaris, medical director of Adult Psychiatry at the Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine, says some fans will need to watch re-runs to ease themselves down.

The scientist claims football fans' brains create dopamine on watching the crowning glory of their favorite sport.

But when the Super Bowl is over, no matter who wins or loses, they often suddenly feel bereft by the   absence of this happiness neurotransmitter.

And the come down can be hard - similar to giving up cigarettes according to Dr Halaris, leaving sufferers depressed and lonely.

He advises easing football fans back to normal life slowly so they can adjust to the off-season period.

'When the football season is over and there's no other game on the schedule for months, you're stuck, so you go through withdrawal,' Dr Halaris says.

He advises fans to watch recordings of the sport slowly weaning themselves off, as well as talking to others about how they feel.

'Don't go cold turkey. Watch football on YouTube, or on recordings, in gradually diminishing amounts,' he says. 'Share your feelings of withdrawal and letdown with a friend or spouse.'

Though hours of re-runs or lengthy conversations about the intricacies of the 49ers defense may not go down well with those long-suffering family members less taken with the sport, there is also some more straightforward advice.

'While it can be unpleasant, football withdrawal is not serious enough to require antidepressants or other medications. And do not self medicate with drugs or alcohol', Dr Halaris continues.

And for those completely unsympathetic to the pains of Super Bowl withdrawal there is one final word of advice that may strike a cord.

'You're just going to have to basically tough it out until football starts up again,' Halaris adds.
