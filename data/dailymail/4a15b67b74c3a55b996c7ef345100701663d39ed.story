Three American contractors have been shot dead by an Afghan soldier during an apparent 'insider attack' in the capital of Kabul.

The shooting by a man believed to be wearing a military uniform unfolded Thursday evening at the military base inside the North Kabul International Airport complex.

The victims, who were employed under a US Defense Department contract to help train the Afghan air force, died from gunshot wounds.

A fourth American man was injured and an Afghan national was also killed in the incident.  

'Insider attacks' by Afghan security forces have been on the rise in recent years and have led to the deaths of 142 people.

Western troops and civilians training Afghan security forces have faced lethal assaults from Afghans in uniform who turn their guns on their counterparts. 

They have had a major impact on trust between US and NATO and Afghan forces since 2008 and leading up to the winding down of combat operations in the country. 

In August Major Gen. Harold J. Greene was the highest ranking official to be killed in four decades in a war zone as the result of an 'insider attack'. 

A military spokesman told The Washington Post: 'We can confirm that there was a shooting incident at North Kabul International Airport complex 29 January at approximately 6:40 p.m.

'Three coalition contractors were killed as was an Afghan local national. This incident is under investigation. Further information will be released as available and appropriate.'

Tight security: The airport in the Afghan capital Kabul is heavily guarded, with one section devoted to commercial aircraft and another area set aside for a NATO contingent

However they would not give any more details in relation to the incident.

Thursday's attack came after a surge in violence by the Taliban insurgency over the past year.

At least nine people were killed earlier Thursday in the country's east when a suicide bomber detonated an explosive at a funeral for victims of a roadside bomb attack.

Most NATO combat troops pulled out of Afghanistan last year but a small contingent of about 12,000 remains in the country, including roughly 10,600 American forces.

The American soldiers, along with other NATO troops and private contractors, are helping the Afghans improve their logistics and build up a fledgling air force.
