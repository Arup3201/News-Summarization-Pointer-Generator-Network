Susan McLaughlin pleads not guilty to a charge of neglect

An elderly woman with Alzheimer's and dementia was trapped overnight on a minibus after she was forgotten by a council driver, a court heard yesterday.

Joan Cook, 88, spent 14 hours on the bus at a depot in Luton, Bedfordshire after being forgotten by Susan McLaughlin, 43, the jury was told.

She was found the next morning sitting calmly in the same seat behind the driver's seat, Luton Crown Court was told

Mrs Cook and another women had been collected from the Hockwell Ring Day Centre in Luton on April 29 last year and should have been dropped off at her sheltered flat in Farley Hill, on the other side of town.

The other woman, Margaret Harkin, was dropped off by McLaughlin, but instead of heading to the Jill Jenkins home afterwards she drove straight to the depot in Kingsway, Luton.

Laura Blackband, prosecuting, said: 'Mrs Cook was left in the van. She had no food, no water, no heating, no light and no toilet and no mobile phone.

'She was 88 years old and suffering from dementia.'

McLoughlin had finished paper work in the van before leaving Mrs Cook and went into the depot where she wrapped a present for a colleague and then left for home.

Mrs Cook had been left in the van at a quarter to five in the evening and was not discovered until a quarter past seven the next morning.

McLaughlin, of Luton, pleaded not guilty to a charge of neglect, contrary to Section 44 of the Mental Capacity Act 2005.

The prosecutor told the jury of six 
men and six women that McLaughlin had worked for Luton Borough Council 
since 2007.Her job was to transport vulnerable elderly people and 
children with special needs.

The
council policy was that the driver would be assisted by an escort, but 
if no escort is available the drivers' job would be to double up.

Mrs Cook was left in the van with no food, water, heating, light or toilet, the prosecution said

Ms Blackband said: 'It was not a big job to look around the van to see who is on it.

'On 29 April Susan McLauglin was working a full day's shift. Towards the end of the day at around 4pm she went to pick up Margaret Harkin and Joan Cook.

'They were picked up from the Hockwell Ring centre and were to be taken back to their care homes.

'Susan McLaughlin took Mrs Harkin back to where she was living.

'At that stage she was supposed to take Mrs Cook to where she was living, but she went to the depot and left Mrs Cook in the van.

'It is not a huge vehicle. Mrs Harkin was on the window side close to the door. Mrs Cook was opposite her on the second row by the window behind the driver.

'Quite why Susan McLauglin failed to observe Mrs Cook one can only imagine. It is a clear case of neglect.'

Regrettably, she said nobody at Mrs Cook's care home had noticed she was not there until the morning.

She was discovered at a quarter past seven sitting calmly in the same position, where she had been all night.

When McLaughlin turned up for work in the morning and was told what had happened she was said to be 'dazed, shocked and upset.' She was asked to drive Mrs Cook home, which she did.

The trial continues.
