Top student: Laura Johnson looked demure in a white shirt and glasses as she heard the case against her at Inner London Crown Court

A millionaire's daughter stood in the dock yesterday as a jury heard how she took part in a two-hour crime spree on the worst night of last summer’s riots.

Laura Johnson, 20, ‘exercised extraordinarily bad judgment’ when she got ‘swept up’ in looting electrical goods, alcohol and cigarettes, a court was told.

The former grammar school pupil is accused of driving a getaway car for three male accomplices, who went on the rampage in London.

The Exeter University student claims she was forced to drive the car under duress by three young black men who were not the ‘sort of people you say no to’.

But a jury at Inner London Crown Court yesterday heard that she had acted entirely of her own free will, engaging in a ‘joint enterprise’ to take ‘goods and their thieves from place to place’.

Sandy Canavan, prosecuting, said: ‘She knew what she was doing. This is a young lady who exercised extraordinarily bad judgment on that night.

‘Hers were hardly the actions of somebody who was forced to drive around too scared and frightened and afraid to do anything other than that they are told.

‘The prosecution say that duress is no more than a red herring in this case.’

Dressed in a white blouse, black mini skirt and boots, Johnson spoke yesterday only to confirm her name as she stood in the dock with her co-accused, a 17-year-old youth who cannot be named for legal reasons.

Also in court were her parents Lindsay and Robert, who run direct marketing firm Avongate from their home.

The jury yesterday heard how she was first spotted in the early hours of August 9 by a passer-by, Witness A, who also cannot be named for legal reasons.

He saw her sitting in a black Smart car on a retail park in Charlton, South-East London that was being besieged by around 100 rioters, as three men ran back and forth bringing televisions from a branch of the electrical store Currys.

Miss Canavan said that one of these men was the 17-year-old co-defendant, who was ‘running back clearly to help himself to other items he wasn’t entitled to’.

She said that at one point Witness A also saw the university student get out of the car and pick up a television box dropped by one of the men, which she then put in her car.

He phoned the police and decided to follow the car to a nearby petrol station, where he saw one of her passengers emerge wearing a balaclava and carrying what he believed to be a kitchen knife.

The prosecution said that after stealing electrical goods from Currys, the group went to a BP petrol station. They then went to a branch of Comet, in nearby Greenwich, which is where Johnson was arrested.

Miss Canavan said: ‘She responded to the police shouts to stop by revving the engine with a view to driving off. She didn’t get the chance as they smashed the side window and indeed the windscreen with a view to keep her precisely where they wanted her.’

In the car police found two LCD TVs and a third TV, a microwave and alcohol and cigarettes.

Johnson, who before the riots had been treated for anxiety and depression at a psychiatric hospital, later told police that she had been a ‘bit concerned’ by the acts of that night but that she had driven the car as the three men were ‘not the sort of people you say no to’.

She said they had jumped into her car while she ran an errand in Catford, South-East London, and had then directed her every move over the next few hours.

She later told doctors she felt under duress to drive because failure to do so would result in ‘violence to her and her family’ and claimed a man known as T Man had threatened her by holding a thumb to her throat and applying pressure.

But Miss Canavan said the defendants were ‘swept along as so many others were into behaviour that in the cold light of day they can hardly believe they voluntarily engaged in, but nevertheless, voluntarily engage in they did’.

Johnson, who has been bailed to her parents’ large detached farmhouse in Orpington, Kent, was a high-flying pupil at Newstead Wood School in Bromley, Kent.

She is also a former pupil of St Olave’s Grammar School in Orpington, the fourth best performing state school in the country. Johnson denies three counts of burglary and three of handling stolen goods.

Her 17-year-old co-defendant denies two charges of burglary and two of handling stolen goods. He has pleaded guilty to one count of burglary.

The jury heard that Alexander Elliot-Joahill, 18, had pleaded guilty to several charges of burglary and handling stolen goods.

The trial continues.
