Desperate blinded PC David Rathband told his estranged wife she would 'look nice in black' in a cry for help phone call just an hour before he killed himself.

The morbid conversation sparked frantic text chat between his widow Kath and his sister Debbie who both became frightened he was about to commit suicide in his Northumberland home, it was revealed today.

On February 29, the day he died, Mrs Rathband visited her husband, who had been in bed for three days, not eating and taking too much medication.

She asked his sister to visit and pick him up because Rathband had just thrown her out of his house and Kath was worried he was suicidal, according to a series of texts in The Sun.

But Debbie, who had tried to contact him for days, was unable to get to his home in Blyth, and urged his wife to contact the authorities to get him sectioned and prevent him taking his own life.

At 17.57pm Rathband then called his wife of 20 years in one final cry for help. They had allegedly split after she believed he had an affair with 7/7 attack survivor Lisa French.

'He just phoned me one minute ago and told me I will look nice in black. I have told him I will help him but he won't let me,' Mrs Rathband said in a text to his sister.

'I have left a message for his welfare officer to call me. If David won't answer the door they can break in,' she told Debbie 30 minutes later.

Gunman: Fugitive Raoul Moat shot PC Rathband in the face while he was sat in his patrol car in July 2010 an act that eventually led to his death

But tragically just 25 minutes later PC Rathband's body was discovered in his home.

He hanged himself 20 months after being blinded by gunman Raoul Moat, 
who shot him twice at point-blank range as he sat in his parked traffic 
car in Newcastle upon Tyne.

Moat, 37, had already shot his former girlfriend, Samantha Stobbart, 23,
and murdered her new partner, 29-year-old karate instructor Chris 
Brown.

After seven days on the run he was cornered in the Northumberland 
village of Rothbury and at the end of a six-hour stand-off with police 
he shot himself in the head.

Rathband's poignant funeral was overshadowed by a bitter feud that has engulfed and divided his family.

His twin brother Darren, 44, used a nine-minute eulogy at the end of the emotional ceremony to launch a barely-veiled attack on Kath.

Relations between Darren and Mrs Rathband had deteriorated since she and PC Rathband separated last year, and Darren warned that she was not welcome at the funeral and that it was his brother’s wish that she did not attend.

She defied those wishes for the sake of the couple’s children Ashley, 19, and Mia, 13, arriving 45 minutes early for the 12pm service at Stafford Crematorium, long before the arrival of the funeral cortège.

Later, as he addressed the 200 mourners, 
Darren – who is also a policeman – said: ‘There have been times when 
our lives have run in parallel, separated by  distance, and at times by 
others who strove to break a unique bond. I say to those who tried in 
life and now in his death, you have failed.

‘I hope that those who carry a burden after his death carry it within themselves and not aim to lay that at his graveside.

‘It is just as cowardly to judge an absent person as it is wicked to strike a defenceless one.

‘I just hope the memory of my brother, and Ash and Mia’s father, is not tarnished by others who feel the need to set the record straight.'

Kath Rathband said yesterday that David Rathband had a string of affairs during their two-decade marriage.

In an interview with a Sunday newspaper, she claimed this started when she was pregnant with their 19-year-old son Ashley but she always took him back after he was unfaithful.

‘I always loved him, but I knew emotionally that he was weak,’ she told the Sunday Mirror.

‘He also really loved me and the kids. I couldn’t imagine living without him. And I know he would have made life incredibly difficult if he left.

‘He’d say “I’m always going to be there, you know that? I’ll never leave you alone”. I would put up with things to keep it on an even keel.’
