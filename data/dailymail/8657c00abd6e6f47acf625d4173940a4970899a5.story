Heartbroken friends and relatives of April Jones have issued new poignant photos of the missing girl.

The pictures of the five-year-old, who disappeared while playing outside her home seven weeks ago, were posted on Facebook and show her smiling in a garden and playing on a sunny day at a beach.

Police are vowing to continue searching for April and have been scouring two wooded areas in the hunt for clues in the search for the schoolgirl, who vanished in Machynlleth, Wales, on October 1.

Dyfed-Powys Police still has 10 
specialist teams searching Dyfi and Tan Y Coed forests to the north of 
the town. The force insisted last week that it was doing everything to 
find the little girl.

A police spokesman said: 'The search continues utilising teams from across the UK. The numbers of teams and officers searching increase and decrease to meet demand and requirements for specific search areas.

'We will continue searching as long as
we have viable lines of enquiry and it is unhelpful to speculate on how
long that will take.'

The Duke of Cambridge has thanked 
mountain rescue teams for their work in the search - and Prime Minister 
David Cameron said all of Britain has been impressed with how 
Machynlleth has coped.

'We will continue searching as long as we have viable lines of enquiry'

'We are continuing to support April’s 
family and maintaining dialogue with the community to keep the area of

Mark Bridger, 47, has been charged with murder, child abduction, and attempting to pervert the course of justice.

The Find April Jones Facebook page, where the new photos were posted, has more than 240,000 'fans'.
