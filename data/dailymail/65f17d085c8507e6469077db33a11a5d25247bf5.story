A New York artist has created a surreal set of images showing body painted models posing before New York City landmarks.

The models in these images take on a transparent, almost ghost-like appearance - it is the result of a painstakingly detailed body-painting photo shoot among the city's most recognizable backdrops.

Artist Trina Merry, 34, spends eight gruelling hours hand painting her models so they blend in seamlessly with their surroundings.

The resulting pictures show the models posing up against New York City landmarks such as the Freedom Tower, the Empire State Building, Central Park and the Brooklyn Bridge.

Merry moved to the city only recently and said painting models into the city-scape was the way for her to engage with her new home.

Such is the level of detail on the body painting, the models appear translucent, often with only their footwear left contrasting with their surroundings.

Merry has previously stated she believes bodypainting creates a 'special connection' to a person that other art forms do not - it is, she said, a 'distinctly human experience'.

While on the right, the model faces the camera with the spectacular Brooklyn Bridge as her backdrop - her brightly coloured shoes left clearly distinguishable

This photo required an incredible amount of work to get the body paint dimensions perfect - the model appears almost translucent as she stands before Coney Island

Fame: These images have been viewed around the world - now body artist Trina Merry has given an insight into how she creates her work, despite run-ins with police
