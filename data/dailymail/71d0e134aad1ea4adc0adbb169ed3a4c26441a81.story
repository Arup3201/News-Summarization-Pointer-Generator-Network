A 47-year old grandmother has been charged with child abuse after she allowed her grandson to steer her car in a car park while sitting on her lap. 

The three-year-old crashed into three cars at an apartment complex in Orlando, Florida on Sunday when police were alerted. 

An eyewitness saw the car hit three vehicles and ran to confront the driver, only to discover a three-year-old boy behind the wheel. 

Documents posted by The Smoking Gun confirm that Volanda Cousar, who has a New Jersey driving licence was arrested on Sunday afternoon following the incident and taken to Orange County Jail where she signed a $2,000 bail bond.

'Witnesses told dispatch that a small child was seen sitting on the lap of the driver while the crashes were occurring.

'Upon arrival we observed a sliver Cyrsler four-door vehicle parked in the center of the parking lot. The driver of the vehicle later identified by New Jersey driver licence as Volanda Cousar, was standing next to the vehicle with a three year old black male juvenile.
