Holidaymakers are cashing in on the pound’s dramatic rise against the euro.

Fears for the prospects of debt-stricken states on the Continent have seen sterling hit a three-and-a-half year high against the single currency.

Bureaux de change reported a flood of demand yesterday from travellers and businessmen who are getting at least 1.20 euros to the pound.

‘This is a real bonus for our customers,’ said Peter Long, of TUI Travel, which owns the Thomson and First Choice holiday brands.

Travelex, a currency specialist, was offering a rate of 1.208 euros to the pound yesterday – up 9 per cent on the 1.105 seen 12 months ago and a vast improvement on the December 2008 low when £1 bought just 1 euro.

It means that £500 now buys 604 euros compared with 552 euros this time last year and the miserable 500 euros when the currencies were on a par with each other.

Elvin Eldic, regional manager of Travelex UK, reported a flood of interest from Britons looking to swap their pounds for euros.

‘The weekend’s elections in France and Greece have thrown the eurozone into fresh turmoil, driving the pound to a three-and-a-half year high against the euro,’ he said.

‘With the forecast remaining bleak here in the UK and another bank holiday weekend on the horizon for the Queen’s Jubilee, it’s a great opportunity for cash-strapped Brits to escape to sunnier climes without breaking the budget.’

Bureaux de change also offering above 1.20 euros included the Post Office and Moneycorp. Most high street banks were offering less generous rates.

Olann Kerrison of Moneycorp, which was offering just 1.075 euros to the pound last June, said: ‘Considering the euro was flirting with parity versus the pound less than a year ago, this latest market movement is not only great news for British holidaymakers, it’s also great timing as the holiday season approaches.

A customer exchanging £500 can put an extra 50 euros in their pocket.’

Andrew Brown, head of travel money at the Post Office, said: ‘Holidaymakers visiting Post Office branches today will find that sterling now buys more euros than at any time since November 2008.

‘Our advice to travellers is to keep a close eye on the rates as their holiday approaches.’

Clem Chambers, of market information service ADVFN.com, said towering debts and a backlash against austerity were undermining the euro.

He added: ‘It is little wonder the currency has reached a low against the pound not seen for three-and-a-half years.

‘Europe remains far from turning the tide of its fiscal and economic weaknesses.’

Analysts at currency firm Caxton FX think the pound could hit 1.30 euros within six months.

One, Richard Driver, said: ‘The latest political developments from Greece and France have had an immediate impact on the euro and the long-term consequences are potentially disastrous for the single currency.

‘Sterling is gaining plenty of momentum thanks to its growing safe-haven status and considering the chronic instability within the eurozone, we could realistically see the pound hitting 1.30 euro mark by the autumn.
