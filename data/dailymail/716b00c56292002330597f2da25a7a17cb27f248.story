A three-year-old girl was kidnapped by a stranger through her bedroom window - but miraculously saved when her father and uncle chased her abductor down the street, police have said.

The unidentified youngster was allegedly snatched by the hooded man after he leaned through her window at her family's Southern California home on Thursday and told her to 'come toward him'.

However, she was rescued when her father and uncle reportedly heard a commotion and ran out of the house, pursuing the alleged kidnapper down the street until they eventually caught up with him.

They then tackled the man to the ground, it is said.

Now, the man has been arrested by police on suspicion of kidnapping the infant. His name, age and place of residence are currently being withheld by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.

In a statement, the Department said: 'A male adult allegedly grabbed ahold of a 3-year-old female by reaching through a bedroom window at the female’s residence.'

During the incident at around 7pm, the man - who was 'wearing a hoodie' according to family members - allegedly pulled a screen off the bedroom window and reached through to the little girl.

'He leaned in the window and then told her to come toward him,' the youngster's aunt, Adriana, told KTLA 5, adding that her entire family had been in the house during the 'frightening' attack.

The man then grabbed the child and dragged her away from the house in the 24200 block of Arch Street in the Newhall area of Santa Clarita, before running down the street with her, deputies said.

However, after the girl's father and uncle heard a commotion and realized she was missing, they reportedly chased her attacker down the road until they were just feet away from him.

'I actually … ran behind him,' said the girl’s uncle, whose name is Jesus. 'I think he heard my footsteps and then he turned around quickly and asked me if this was my daughter.'

After Jesus told the kidnapper that the girl was his daughter in an attempt to get her back, the man handed her back to him and made to flee, her relatives said.

But he was stopped when the girl's father suddenly tackled him, knocking him to the ground before restraining him. When deputies arrived at the scene, they were able to take the man into custody.

In the statement, the Sheriff's Department said that the girl had been safely returned to her relatives and was startled, but not harmed. It added that deputies have set up a perimeter at the scene.

During a press conference on Friday morning, deputy Joshua Dubin described the incident as a 'scary' and 'random kidnapping' that involved the suspect 'breaking out a window screen'.
