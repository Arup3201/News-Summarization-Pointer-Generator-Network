This is the moment a six-month old hamster successfully steers a 15-tonne truck up a perilous quarry road.

Engineers at Volvo wanted to demonstrate the lightweight steering on its latest generation of lorries.

So they transformed the steering column on a Volvo FMX into a giant hamster wheel and placed pint-sized Charlie inside.

Scroll down for video.

Best of friends: Charlie the hamster and stunt driver Seon Williams are now best of friends after completing their perilous mission

Carrot not stick: Seon, from Essex, used a tasty carrot to encourage Charlie to run from one side of the wheel to the other

Then, with stunt driver Seon Rogers in the driver's seat, the two unlikely work partners set off on their way up the narrow and steep quarry in Los Tres Cunados, north-west Spain.

Seon, from Essex, used a tasty carrot to encourage Charlie to run from one side of the wheel to the other.

Incredibly, the steering was so light that the direction of the tiny animal's running was enough to steer the lorry around the tight bends.

Ham-star: The star of the show was Charlie, from Oxfordshire, who had to undergo several weeks of training prior to the test

Following a few nervy moments, which saw boulders crash off the side of the narrow road, Seon and Charlie completed the challenge.

The video was set up to demonstrate the new Volvo Dynamic Steering, a new idea designed to take the strain out of turning the wheel for drivers all over the world.

But the star of the show was Charlie, from Oxfordshire, who had to undergo several weeks of training prior to the test.

Nerves: For the steering wheel, Volvo use an electric motor to replaces the driver's muscle power, making it possible for 175 gram Charlie to steer the truck

Quiet life for me: Charlie the hamster in his normal habitat, a hamster 'igloo', back home in quiet Oxfordshire

In just two days the video has been viewed online more than 650,000 times.

Animal trainer Grace Dickinson said: 'Charlie's our star. He demonstrated that he has the best strength, confidence and attitude to learning new ideas.'
