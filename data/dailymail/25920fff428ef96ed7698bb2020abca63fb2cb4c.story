A bag that was stowed away on a private plane that went missing earlier this month was reportedly found on a small Caribbean island.

The BN2 Islander plane carrying fashion boss Vittorio Missoni, his wife, two friends, and two pilots disappeared on January 4 off the coast of Venezuela.

A  German tourist found the bag from the plane on the small island country Curacao in the southern Caribbean Sea on January 10.

‘They are not drawing any conclusion. This is simply another piece of an already complex puzzle,’ U.S. Missoni spokeswoman Angela Mariani told Women's Wear Daily.

Mariani said the bag belonged to an Italian tourist whose plane had taken off around the same time as the Missoni plane, which was believed to be heading south from Los Roques, an archipelago and resort, south to Caracas.

Because there was no room on the tourist's plane for him to put his bag, it was stowed away on the Missoni plane.

‘The Missoni family is aware of this news. However, no conclusions can be drawn from this information. The search is continuing in full force,’ the family said in an official statement.

Inside the bag was kite-surfing gear, which belonged to Giorgio Neri, who was heading to Los Roques on a flight that took off right after the Missoni plane departed.

Neri reportedly asked one of the passengers on the fashion mogul's plane to carry his bag because there was not enough space on his own plane.

Venezuelan officials have been searched the waters around Curacao, and say they will continue their effort to uncover clues.

Vittorio Missoni, 58, runs his family’s fashion house in Varese, Italy with his siblings, Luca and Angela.
