'Broken man': Gus Yiambilis, 30, has been charged with killing his mother with carbon monox0de in April - but his lawyer insist the two had made a suicide pact because they could not deal with their financial and medical problems

A 30-year-old Pennsylvania man has been charged with murder in the carbon monoxide death of his mother back in April - but his attorney insists that the mother and son had made a suicide pact.

Koustantinos 'Gus' Yiambilis, of Bensalem, and his mother, 59-year-old Karen Yiambilis, left several suicide notes before the son allegedly powered on an electric generator inside their apartment, filling the rooms with noxious fumes that quickly overcame the two.

When police were called to the home by concerned neighbors, they discovered Mrs Yiambilis unconscious on the floor and her son confused and listless, but awake.

The 59-year-old married mother of two later died, but Gus Yiambilis survived and was charged with murder and aiding a suicide.

During a hearing scheduled for later today, Yiambilis ' attorney will try to convince a judge to drop the murder charge against the 30-year-old suspect.

‘I can't state emphatically enough that this was not murder,’ William Goldman told Philadelphia inquirer. ‘His mom left notes to donate her hair to Locks of Love. She said she was taking Gus home to God.’

Final farewell: The mother and son left behind seven suicide notes, one of which (pictured) stated that they could no longer deal with the negativity in this world and wanted to go 'home to God'

According to the lawyer, the mother and son had lost the will to live because they were both unemployed, burdened with debt, on the verge of eviction and suffering from medical problems.

Yiambilis was fired from his job at a bank just days earlier and was in needed of a brain surgery he could not afford, NBC 10 reported at the time. His mother, an out-of-work artist and designer, was suffering from a painful condition called fibromyalgia. 

‘She was tired of being cold and hungry, and Gus felt like a total failure. He was a broken man,’ Goldman said. ‘They turned to each other.’

On the evening of April 7, Mrs Yiambilis left a heart-breaking note blaming 'the negativity in this world' for her and Gus' decision to end their lives. 

‘We are sorry but we wish to not deal with it anymore. We are going home to God,’ she stated.

Out of options: Mrs Yiambilis, pictured with her daughter, was unemployed and suffering from chronic pain when she allegedly made a suicide pact with her ailing and out-of-wok son

At around 8pm that night, police say the 30-year-old Mr Yiambilis turned on a gasoline-powered portable generator inside their apartment in the 3000 block of Bristol road in Bensalem, where cracks and vents had been sealed with duct tape to prevent carbon monoxide fumes from escaping.

According to her obituary, Mrs Yiambilis had a husband, George, but it appears that the couple had been living apart. Their daughter, Eleni, works in Philadelphia. 

When interviewed by police later, Gus Yiambilis admitted that he was the one who switched on the generator.

Speaking from his hospital bed with detectives, the 30-year-old also allegedly stated: 'I can't believe I killed my mother. She's the only thing i got.'

Buck County prosecutor Alan Garabedian wrote in a recent court filing that they had enough evidence to charge Yiambiis with murder - and in May a judge ruled that the case against the son was strong enough to go to trial.
