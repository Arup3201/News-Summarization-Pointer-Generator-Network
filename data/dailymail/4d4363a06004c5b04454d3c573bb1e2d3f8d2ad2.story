As the leader of the world’s most feared and brutal terrorist organisation, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi emerged from hiding hoping to strike fear into his opponents.

But the elusive head of the Al-Qaeda aligned Islamic State group found himself the subject of mockery after delivering his sermon wearing a bulky designer watch.

Dressed in black robes and turban, Baghdadi’s appearance was the first since he declared himself the caliph, or leader, of the world’s 1.2 billion Muslims.

Zoom: Some speculated online that it was a Rolex or Omega piece costing thousands of pounds

His decision to wear the silver 
accessory, thought to be a Rolex or Sekonda costing up to £4,000, as he 
asked followers to ‘obey’ him, was ridiculed by commentators.

The
 costly timepiece was said to jar with his choice of black outfit, 
believed to be an attempt to mimic Islamic leaders from over 1,000 years
 ago.

One Twitter user wrote
 said:  ‘The funny thing about Caliph Baghdadi is that he has a very 
sophisticated watch and he still can tell which millennium it is.

Another said: ‘Our caliph, bless him, was probably wearing a Swiss watch. Which brand and where did it come from?’

And a third tweeted: ‘I mean the caliph looks like he’s doing alright.’

Alternative: Despite the criticism some have claimed it is in fact a pious Islamic model

Others said that it was contradictory to the content of his speech in which he described his followers as equals.

Described
 as the world’s most wanted man, militants operating under Baghdadi’s 
control have spread terror through Syria and Iraq in an attempt to form a
 new Islamic state in the Middle East.

The
 Sunni fighters, responsible for the brutal slaughter of thousands, have
 vowed to expand the so-called caliphate to huge swathes of Europe and 
Africa.

Video footage of 
Baghdadi, who has garnered the nickname ‘the invisible sheikh’ due to 
his elusive nature, emerged online on Friday and was quickly spread by 
jihadi websites.

Fighters 
from the group – previously known as ISIS - were among those who joined a
 packed congregation at the Great Mosque in Mosul, Iraq’s second largest
 city, as he delivered the 21-minute speech.

Referring
 to himself as ‘the leader who presides over you’, Baghdadi said that he
 could return the Muslim world to ‘dignity, might, rights and 
leadership.’

He said: ‘I am 
the wali (leader) who presides over you, though I am not the best of 
you, so if you see that I am right, assist me.’

‘I am not better than you or more virtuous than you,’ he added.

People were quick to spot the watch being worn by al-Baghdadi as he conducted the 20-minute sermon

Another asked on Twitter what make watch the Caliph was wearing during the video

He
 also used the sermon to praise his army of fighters, who have taken 
control of Mosul only one month before, and called for the strict 
interpretation of Islamic law.

‘God
 gave your mujahedeen brothers victory after long years of jihad and 
patience... so they declared the caliphate and placed the caliph in 
charge,’ he said.

‘This is a duty on Muslims that has been lost for centuries.’

Analysis of the video suggests that the black-faced watch could be an Omega Seamaster, which can cost up to £4,000.

Omega has been associated with James Bond movies since 1995.

When Pierce Brosnan took over the role of James Bond he wore the Omega Seamaster Quartz Professional in the movie GoldenEye.

In all later films, Brosnan wore an Omega Seamaster Professional Chronometer.

Daniel Craig, who starred in Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace and Skyfall, also wears the Omega Seamaster.

The watch is believed to be either a Rolex, Sekonda or £4,000 Omega Seamaster (pictured)

Only
 two images of Baghdadi – who was the leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq - are 
thought to have existed before his appearance in the video.

Reports
 have claimed that the terror chief even insists on talking to his 
deputies wearing a mask in an effort to protect his identity.

Iraqi
 officials last night said they were still working to authenticate the 
video but it is understood initial investigations have concluded the 
preacher is Baghdadi.

The US offered £5.8million for information leading to his capture or death in 2011

The group is thought to be made up of 11,000 fighters in Iraq and Syria and 3,000 foreign jihadis, including 500 Britons.
