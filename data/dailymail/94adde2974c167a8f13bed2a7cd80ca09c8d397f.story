The last-standing barrack of a Nazi concentration camp in the Netherlands which was later used to house thousands of Indonesian Moluccan exiles is being restored.

A total of 749 people died at the camp 
during the Second World War when it was the only official SS 
concentration camp in western Europe outside of Germany.

After the war the site was used to house
Dutch collaborators and German evacuees before the barracks were turned
into accommodation for thousands of Dutch Moluccans, from the Maluku 
Islands, an archipelago with Indonesia.

Work underway: The site is expected to re-open its doors in the autumn when it will hold an exhibition dedicated to the Dutch Moluccans

The Moluccans, who were former soldiers of the Netherlands armed forces, and their families, were moved to Kamp Vught in 1951 to await repatriation following Indonesian independence.

A housing estate remains at the former camp while other parts of the site are still used as a military barracks.

The last-standing barrack of the concentration camp is now being restored and is expected to re-open to the public in the autumn with an exhibition dedicated to the Dutch Molucans.

Parts of the camp were initially reopened in 2002 following extensive renovations.

Accommodation: Barrack 1B at the Dutch National Monument Kamp Vught was used to house Dutch Moluccans in 1951 following Indonesian independence

Work on the construction of the 
camp started in May 1942 with the first prisoners arriving before it was 
finished at the end of that year.

According to the camp's website, the first prisoners had come from the camp in Amersfoort and they were swiftly followed by a large number of Jews.

Most of the Jews were quickly moved to a transit camp in Westerbork before being sent to the death camps in Poland.

Hundreds of people lost their lives at Kamp Vught because of the appalling conditions.
