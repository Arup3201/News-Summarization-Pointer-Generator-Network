The father of a young woman allegedly harassed by the so-called Wolf of Shenfield is suspected of arranging for him to be shot as a ‘punishment’.

Lee Victory, 51, was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder City trader Robin Clark after police raided his home.

He worked at the same brokers that Mr Clark left shortly after a complaint about his treatment of Mr Victory’s daughter Danielle, 23.

Lee Victory, 51, who has reportedly been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder  stockbroker Robin Clark, dubbed the Wolf of Shenfield. Clark left brokerage BGC after a complaint over his treatment of Victory's daughter Danielle Victory, 23. He is pictured with her

At
 the time she worked on the Euro desk at brokers BGC, which was headed 
by Mr Clark. He earned millions as a senior managing director.

It is understood that Miss Victory was at the centre of several complaints that Mr Clark made sexual comments towards her.

Mr Clark is accused of promising the junior broker ‘the world’ and asking if she would sleep with him.

Rumours also swirled around the brokerage firm that he tried to take a photograph up her skirt at a glamorous charity dinner.

Mr
 Victory, who is originally from London’s East End and now lives in Essex, is a 
veteran employee at BGC and friend of president Shaun Lynn.

His daughter has left BGC since the controversy over her alleged harassment and joined a recruitment firm in Essex.

Mr
 Clark landed a new £400,000-a-year job at another City firm but has 
been plagued by financial problems, which sparked a fire sale of his 
assets.

It is understood Mr
 Victory, who has a keen interest in cage fighting, was away in Dubai on
 business when Mr Clark was shot shortly before 6am on January 24.

The
 twice-divorced father-of-four was getting out of his car at Shenfield 
rail station, Essex, when a gunman in a balaclava confronted him.

Mr Clark was shot in the top of his thigh with a sawn-off shotgun. The pellets blasted away a fist-sized chunk of flesh and narrowly missed a vital artery

Police believe Mr Clark was deliberately targeted, although he has said he had 'no idea why someone would want to hurt me like this'

At the time, sources revealed officers were investigating the possibility that Mr Clark was attacked by a love rival or over a financial dispute

Mr
 Clark was shot in the top of his thigh with a sawn-off shotgun. The 
pellets blasted away a fist-sized chunk of flesh and narrowly missed a 
vital artery.

The victim - nicknamed after The Wolf of Wall Street film starring Leonardo DiCaprio - spent a month in hospital.

He
 was treated in hospital under armed guard and surgeons said the bullet,
 which entered his right leg six inches above his knee, missed arteries 
by millimetres.

Police 
believe Mr Clark was deliberately targeted, although he has said he had 
‘no idea why someone would want to hurt me like this’.

Investigators
 at British Transport Police suspect whoever pulled the trigger was a 
contract hit man. They have released Mr Victory on bail.

At
 the time, sources revealed officers were investigating the possibility 
that Mr Clark was attacked by a love rival or over a financial dispute.

A man arrested in connection with the shooting of Robin Clark, 44 (pictured), at Shenfield station in January, was allegedly upset with Mr Clark after the trader made sexual comments to his daughter

Police reportedly arrested Lee Victory, 51, yesterday on suspicion of conspiracy to murder

Mr Clark was shot once in the thigh outside Shenfield station with a sawn-off shotgun in January

One
 source said: ‘It’s clear that the gunman meant the shot to be a 
punishment rather than to kill. It’s some kind of revenge attack.’

When
 Mr Clark returned to work at City of London broker RP Martin he was 
surprised by colleagues wearing balaclavas and waving fake guns.

They shouted ‘bang’ at him causing Mr Clark to violently reel away from his ‘attackers’, ripping the stitches out of his wounds.

The
 bad taste prank left him requiring further hospital treatment but he 
later described it as a ‘well meaning’ way of welcoming him back.

He said: ‘Some of the guys thought it was a way to defuse the tension on my return to work. My colleagues have been brilliant.’

Mr
 Clark was compared to Jordan Belfort, the main character in hit movie 
The Wolf of Wall Street, because of his flashy lifestyle.

But
 he moved out of his £2.2million five-bedroom house in Ingatestone, near
 Shenfield, last year and started renting it out after running into 
debt.

Friends said the broker had been suffering money worries in recent years, and was saddled with debts.

Last
 year a county court judgment was filed against him for debts of 
£14,653, and he was director of several companies that were shut while 
owing money.

A police spokesman said: ‘A 51-year-old man from Essex has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder.

‘He has since been interviewed and released on police bail pending further enquiries.’
