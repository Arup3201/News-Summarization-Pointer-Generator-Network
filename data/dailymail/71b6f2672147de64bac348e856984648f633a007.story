On the new political drama State of Affairs, Katherine Heigl plays a CIA analyst dealt the heavy responsibility of keeping the president informed on the biggest national security issues of the day, which she compiles in a folder called the President's Daily Brief.

But the CIA says paper briefs are SO last administration. 

The spy agency has been live-tweeting State of Affairs every Monday night, using the show's plot to dispel rumors and educate viewers on the history of the 'PDB' and how it comes together today. 

In several scenes on the show, Heigl's character Charleston Tucker is seen talking the president, played by Alfre Woodard, through the daily brief printed out on sheets of paper in a leather folder. The CIA says the PDB hasn't been printed out for years. Instead, President Barack Obama and other key policy makers view their daily brief in tablet form.

A modern president:  President Obama no longer kills trees to read his daily brief. Instead, he and other key national security policy makers view the document on a tablet, the CIA revealed

In another episode, Heigl is seen meeting in person with other CIA agents, which the agency says is actually dangerous since enemies can target both parties in one place. 

One way agents get around meeting face to face is by staging 'dead drops' in which they hide information to be picked up by the other party. The CIA then tweeted a picture from their museum, showing an old dead drop spike, a hollow device that was pushed into the ground for concealment.

A CIA spokesman told TMZ that State of Affairs is helping 'counter popular myths and misconceptions about the agency', and that social media is the perfect way to give Americans more information as the show plays in real time.

Secret weapon: State of Affairs has been getting a boost of authenticity from two ex-CIA officials currently employed on the show as produces. Rodney Faraon, pictured above, worked on the daily briefing team for the Clinton and second Bush Administrations  

Personalized: Woodward's character on the show looks over her daily brief in paper form. The CIA says the PDB has been formatted to each president's standards. President Obama just prefers to read his on an iPad 

However, most of what is seen on the show is likely in line with how the CIA really works, since two ex-agents are producers and Heigl revealed  that the show is also working with the agency.

'We are delving into stuff in a way no one else can do because we are actually working with CIA guys who are telling us stuff,' Heigl said in a preview for the show. 

Former CIA counterterrorism head Henry Crumpton and Rodney Faraon, who was a member of the daily briefing team in the Clinton and second Bush Administrations, are both producers, bringing their years of working in the CIA to the show. 

'Everything I've seen so far has been authentic,' Faraon said in a preview. 

Living history: The President's Daily Brief has been prepared for the commander-in-chief for the last 60 years. Above, President Lyndon B Johnson looks over his daily brief with Lady Bird and their first grandchild 

Changes: On the left, the first PDB ever (then known as the Daily Summary), prepared for President Truman on Feb 15, 1946. On the right, the more compact form of the daily brief compiled for President John F Kennedy. During the Kennedy Administration, the daily brief was changed to the President's Intelligence Checklist or 'PICL' which was pronounced 'pickle'. It was made small enough to fit in the president's jacket pocket 

And for a super-secret spy agency, the CIA appears to maintain a semblance of transparency with their Entertainment Industry Liason office, which consults with the film and television industry on productions depicting the agency.

According to the CIA's website, the goal of the Entertainment Industry Liason is to ensure 'accurate portrayal of the men and women of the CIA' by 'answering questions, debunking myths, or arranging visits to the CIA'. 

The CIA also provides stock images of it's Langley, Virginia compound and in some cases even permits filming at headquarters.
