Ministers were last night struggling to contain a spiralling row about highly contentious plans to bar 430,000 civil servants from talking to journalists.

Critics raised concerns about a quiet change to the civil service code, which they warned could ‘stifle whistleblowing’ and open government.

The code has been amended to include a new provision making clear that officials could be sacked if they speak out before checking with a minister.

Downing Street was understood to have intervened in the row, forcing the Cabinet Office to offer a series of concessions.

Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude agreed to redraft guidance to ‘strengthen protection’ for those speaking out to blow the whistle on scandals or abuses of public money, and include a commitment to being ‘as open as possible’ with Parliament and the public.

However, that is unlikely to appease critics, who have asked why such a change has been enforced just before the general election campaign.

It appears to have been agreed by Sir Jeremy Heywood, the Cabinet Secretary, who has been nicknamed Sir Cover-Up for preventing the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq War from seeing letters and records of phone calls between Tony Blair and George Bush.

However, the impetus is understood to have come from ministers, who wanted to control the flow of information from departments to make clear that they, not civil servants, are ultimately in charge. 

A line has been added to the civil service code, which governs officials’ conduct, saying: ‘Ensure you have ministerial authorisation for any contact with the media.’

Margaret Hodge, who chairs the Commons public accounts committee, said the Cabinet Office was ‘using a sledgehammer to crack a nut’.

‘You don’t want to encourage briefing against ministers, or criticising people behind their backs,’ she said.

‘But the more openness, the more understanding people have of the way government works, the better.’

Tory MP Charlotte Leslie, who has championed more openness in the health service, said it could stifle whistleblowing. 

‘It makes sense that the Government wants to get its work done without a running commentary from inside the system, but I would like them to set out what they have in place to help people whistleblowing,’ she said.

Ministers point that out civil servants can blow the whistle on a major scandal using legal protections afforded to them in the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1988.

But Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union that represents civil servants, said it was absurd to enforce a ‘blanket ban’ on all 430,000 civil servants having unauthorised contacts with journalists.

Mr Penman: ‘Civil servants will become worried about every contact they have with the media, and will be looking over their shoulder all the time when talking to the public – as that’s who they are talking to through the media – about the service they deliver.’

The Cabinet Office insist that the amendment will not affect contacts between journalists and press officers or advisers who regularly speak to the media. They insist it simply ‘clarifies’ current practice.

Mr Maude last night: ‘The Cabinet Secretary and I are both clear that no one should be exposed to personal and professional risk for doing what is in the public interest.

‘The amendments make no change to the rights of individuals under whistleblowing legislation or our drive to increase Government transparency and openness. 

'However, we will consult on strengthening the protections for whistleblowers.’
