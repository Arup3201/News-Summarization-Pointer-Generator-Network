Pierluigi Collina had spent the best part of half an hour happily explaining why additional referees are the best way of eradicating mistakes in the penalty area when I asked him why FIFA had not bought into his ideas.

It is a curious situation for football at the very highest level, after all; the fact that two extra officials will be present at Champions League matches and at a European Championship but are nowhere to be seen come the World Cup.

It's as if they are ignoring one of the finest referees football has ever seen. Someone surely worth listening to in his role as UEFA's refereeing chief. 'Politics?' I asked Collina, my inference being that common sense has lost out to the apparent power struggle between Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini over the use of goal-line technology. For the first time the otherwise ebullient Collina fell silent.

Football is a fiercely political arena and refereeing doesn't appear to be immune to the kind of nonsense that can actually hinder progress. There is a lack of unity, a lack of consistency, and a sense that the game is suffering as a result.

The last week or so has been less than positive for English refereeing, and not just because two of the three finest officials in the country have been exposed for breaking professional refereeing protocol.

Pierluigi Collina wants extra refs behind each goal

Mark Clattenburg was left off the list last weekend as a result of his Ed Sheeran concert controversy, on what proved to be a weekend when the Premier League could have seriously done with him. Michael Oliver, it has now emerged, has also been guilty of breaking protocol this season, by giving his girlfriend a lift in an official vehicle. Unlike Clattenburg, Oliver does not appear to have been punished. Nobody representing the Professional Game Match Officials is prepared to tell us why.

But Oliver was among those guilty of making some fairly high profile mistakes at the weekend and prompting the former English referees chief to launch what read like a serious attack on his successor.

Keith Hackett now gives his views on the internet and his last blog would not have been well received by PGMOL chief Mike Riley when it was so critical of his 17 top level referees and their working practices.

'Sadly another weekend of fixtures has witnessed our group of professional referees producing less than acceptable performances,' wrote Hackett.

Hackett's damning indictment continued with a claim that England's leading referees are not fit enough and at this moment are employing 'an inconsistent approach to decision making'. He also demanded more of Howard Webb, the former World Cup final referee who does seem to have remained very much in the background since joining Riley to become the PGMOL technical director.

The PGMOL would refute Hackett's claims, and they would do so supported by what they would argue are hard facts. They could point to the results of physical tests that reveal the fitness of our professional referees has improved year on year in the five years since Riley took over.

They might also wish to remind Hackett that England is one of only three countries in Europe to boast three elite FIFA referees; namely Clattenburg, Oliver and Martin Atkinson.

When it came to selecting a referee to take charge of what UEFA probably suspected could be an explosive encounter between Serbia and Albania, it was to the experienced Atkinson that they turned.

Last weekend's games might not have been the finest advert for English officiating but the PGMOL could quote statistics from last season claiming clear signs of improvement.

The accuracy on major decisions – fouls, penalties, cards and so on – rose to 95 per cent last season from 94.1 per cent the previous year. Accuracy in the penalty box has risen to 98 per cent, while offside decisions rose to 99 per cent when they stood at 92 per cent when Riley took charge.

Seasoned, expert observers outside the PGMOL would agree that Hackett is probably wrong; that fitness is not the concern.

But they would say that English football needs more referees like Clattenburg on the pitch rather than in the sin bin.

What Clattenburg does, say the experts, is put in the hard yards that might avoid some of the problems we are seeing this season, and is makes a fair bit of sense.

Clattenburg does not play it safe. He runs wide when it would be easier to run down the middle of the pitch – and so stay closer to the action - and he does so for one simple reason. Because by running wide he gives himself a better angle of vision to see what is actually going on in the penalty area when a referee running just behind the players is more likely to have his view obscured; something we saw this weekend in the case of Oliver and Phil Dowd on Monday night.

Such an approach does come with certain risks if you are being assessed and your livelihood depends on good reports backed up by statistical analysis. For a start a referee might struggle to argue they got it wrong – or failed to act at all - because their view was obscured.

But Clattenburg is so highly rated by his peers because he gets himself in the position to make a call. He didn't have the wit to flag up his desire to go to a concert when it would have been easy for the PGMOL to move him off West Brom versus Crystal Palace, and that might lose him friends. But he's a damn fine referee who needs to avoid getting himself left off the list.

This might be closer to the point Hackett is making when he complains of an inconsistent approach to decision making. Maybe he sees referees playing it safe and not enough officials like Clattenburg. Maybe he sees different methods being applied by referees working under the same leadership at PGMOL.

The PGMOL would refute that too. But at a time when FIFA and UEFA can't even agree on how best to referee the penalty area, raising the concern that there is an alarming lack of consistency seems perfectly reasonable.
