A former SAS soldier died after he plummeted 100ft to the ground in a paragliding accident.

Experienced glider, Bill Young, 64, from Southampton, lost control when a gust of wind got caught in the wing of his craft and crashed to the ground.

The former TA reservist, who had served with the SAS, had carried out 97 jumps in the UK and across Europe in his training.

Bill Young, 64, lost control of the craft when a gust of wind caught its wing and he began falling to the ground

He began falling when his wing collapsed but quickly corrected it, before once more falling to the ground at speed.

Emergency services and friends rallied round in a desperate bid to save him, but despite their best efforts he was pronounced dead at the scene at Combe Gibbet in Hungerford, Berkshire.

His three children have since paid tribute to him, saying he died doing what he loved most.

Gary Young, who learnt of his father's final moments from a friend, said: ‘He was in a good mood, he was happy and bubbly, his goal for the day was that he landed safely.

The former SAS soldier, who has three children, attempted to fix broken wing but glider plummeted 100ft

He cycled 13,000 miles for 13 months during 1993 and 1994 from Perth, Scotland, to Perth, Australia, to raise cash for a Wessex Heartbeat campaign

‘The wing collapsed. He managed to correct it, flew for another couple of seconds, got to around 100 feet and then he fell to the ground at speed.

‘He died doing something he loved. He would rather have gone that way.’

The grandfather-of-seven was also enthusiastic about kitesurfing and snowboarding – sports that took him around the world.

He added: ‘Dad loved to kitesurf all over the world. He most recently travelled around Morocco and had been to Vietnam and Brazil. He always carried his board and kites in his van.

‘He also loved to snowboard and in his earlier years he would cycle, which saw him competing in a triathlon and marathons.

‘He even rode from Perth, Scotland, to Perth, Australia for charity and to visit his friend Tony.

‘It was a family joke that he rode all the way across the world to see Tony, but when he knocked at the door in Perth, Australia, he was not in.

The children of the grandfather-of-seven have paid tribute to him saying Mr Young 'died doing what he loved'

He was also enthusiastic about kitesurfing and snowboarding – sports that took him around the world

‘Paragliding was his most recent love and again took him travelling the world. He flew in France, Spain, Morocco, and all over the UK.

‘We are not sure how he got into it, but we think it is because it is a light wind alternative to kitesurfing.

‘He was happily single with no ties but he had seven grandchildren, who share his love of the outdoors and his eldest has his love of travel, too.’

Guy Young, 37, said: ‘He was very proud that he brought us up and loved us all greatly.’

Their sister Kay, 38, added: ‘He would try everything - he always said he never wanted to grow up.

‘He would check the wind first thing in the morning before he started work. That was his life. He was always there if you needed him.’

Mr Young was a member of 21 SAS Unit attached to D squadron, which he joined in February 1973 and served nearly 15 years, without being called up. He was also a self-employed gas heating engineer.

He once cycled 13,000 miles for 13 months during 1993 and 1994 from Perth, Scotland, to Perth, Australia, to raise cash for a Wessex Heartbeat campaign.
