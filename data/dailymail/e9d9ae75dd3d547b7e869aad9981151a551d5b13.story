A mysterious 'crop circle' that appeared in a California barley field a week ago has been explained: it was a publicity stunt for a tech company.

Nvidia Corporation, a company that makes chips for computers and smart phones, owned up to the stunt at a press conference in Las Vegas Sunday.

CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said he had given his marketing department a small budget and a mission to promote the company's new Tegra K1 chip.

Mystery: This intricate marking cropped up in a field in California on Monday morning

Debate: Some people see the crop circle as proof of alien visitation while others think it was made by humans

Discovery? A YouTube video uploaded by an anonymous user claims to show the first finding of the circle when two friends noticed a flashing green light in the field beside the road

The marketing department delivered, with the 'crop circle' and accompanying YouTube video garnering widespread attention.

The crop circle near Chualar, California, contained a stylized image of a computer chip and the number '192' in Braille. On Sunday, the company announced the Tegra K1, a new chip for tablets and smartphones that contains 192 computing 'cores,' or mini-computers, for graphics applications.

In the new Tegra K1, the graphics component based on its "Kepler" design, used in high-end PCs. The chip would makes for a tablet more powerful than an Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 game console, while consuming one-twentieth the power.

'We've bridged the gap - we've brought mobile computing to the same level as desktop computing,' Huang said.

The 192 cores in the new chip compare to Nvidia's previous flagship, the Tegra 4, with 72 graphics cores.

Huang demonstrated near photo-realistic simulations of environments and human faces, run on the new chip. He said Epic Games will adapt the next version of its Unreal Engine, the basis for many popular games, so that it will work on the chip. He didn't announce when the chip would be available or any gadget makers that were adopting it.

The
 giant markings caused believers to claim that aliens had landed in 
Salinas Valley, while crop circle experts were quick to claim that the 
shape, which resembles a computer chip, was a hoax.

An anonymous video surfaced on YouTube
 that claimed to show the first discovery of the circle, after two 
friends noticed flashing lights in a field and got out of their car to 
investigate.

The first pictures of the markings were taken by photographer Julie Belanger of the 111th Aerial Photography Squadron who flew over the site near Chualar, ten miles south of Salinas.

Berlanger told KSBW: 'It was beautiful. Quite beautiful... I believe it's possible that aliens exist, but I don't know if they would bother making a crop circle to give us a message.'

The YouTube video claimed to show two men finding the markings after they witnessed green flashing lights next to the road.

The footage showed the men leaving their car and climbing over the fence into the field. While the green lights flickered few more times the cameraman focused on the flattened plants.

At one point one of the friends said: 'Dude, are you seeing this? Dude, this is a crop circle.' After walking in the field for a couple of minutes the men appeared the panic and run back to their vehicle.

'A friend and I were driving on Chualar Canyon Road south of Salinas, California before sunrise, and THIS happened,' the YouTube user known only as Cannot Say commented on the video.

Impressive sight: 'It was beautiful. Quite beautiful,' said the aerial photographer who shot the marking

'Needless to say, pretty wild, but we slipped away and it's too good not to share. Created this account since I don't want this tied to me. Still not sure what to make of it.'

Many people were not convinced that the markings were proof of an alien visitation.

The Monterey Herald reported that the site was being protected by security guards on Monday, but they would not name the client they were working for.

Jeffrey Wilson of the Independent Crop Circle Researchers Association also told the paper that there were several signs that the circles were made by human rather than extra-terrestrial life.

Wilson pointed out that the marking was too well aligned with the road, the center of the circle resembled braille and that the YouTube video could have been a form of viral marketing.

'My guess is that ... it is commissioned work for an advertisement,' Wilson explained to the Herald.

'Or a commissioned work for a production company making a documentary on crop circles or for some kind of film.'
