Two teenagers have been arrested for allegedly trying to rob a woman at gunpoint before 
yelling, 'Do you want me to kill your baby?' and shooting her 
13-month-old son dead in his stroller.

Demarquis Elkins, 17, and a 14-year-old boy yet to be identified are being held on suspicion of first-degree murder, Police Chief Tobe Green said, adding that authorities are still searching for a motive.

Sherry West was pushing her son Antonio yards from their home in Brunswick, Georgia, early on Thursday morning when she was approached by the two boys.

She said Elkins demanded money from her and threatened to kill her if she didn't give him any, but she insisted she had nothing.

Murdered: Baby Antonio was shot in the head as he slept by two boys who attempted to rob his mother

Horror: Demarquis Elkins, 17, allegedly threatened Sherry West then shot her infant son when she didn't give him any money

'When you have a baby, you spend all your money on babies. They're expensive,' she said.

'And he kept asking and I just said "I don't have it." And he said, "Do you want me to kill your baby?" And I said, "No, don't kill my baby!"'

She said he fired four shots, the first into the ground. West didn't see a shell casing ejected, and said she assumed the gun wasn't real.

Then he fired at her head and the bullet grazed her left ear; she has a small scab and bruising there. He fired again and shot her in the left leg above the knee.

'The boy proceeded to go around to the stroller and he shot my baby in the face,' she said. 'And then he just shoved me when I started screaming and he ran down London Street with the little boy.'

Ms West began CPR on Antonio but it was in vain and the infant, who had been sleeping when he was shot, died at the scene of the 9am attack.

Several people in the neighborhood called 911 after they heard the gunshots fired, but Rhodes said investigators believed that the mother was the only witness to what happened.

Police combed school records to look for any absences and canvassed neighborhoods searching for the pair. They originally believed the boys were between 10 and 15 years old.

Police are investigating the attack, which took place in a residential neighborhood, but have not found a weapon.

Police spokesman Todd Rhodes urged 
anyone with information to call Brunswick police.

Antonio's father Louis Santiago said he wished he had been there to protect his son.

He told CNN: 'He was so special - he had the bluest, bluest eyes.'

After the attack Mayor Bryan Thompson
 said: 'This is obviously just a terrible day in the city of Brunswick 
made even more so by the senseless killing of a young child, and it 
appears perpetrated by children themselves.

'I
 would like to stress and plead with people in our community right now, 
people who are hearing my voice and seeing us standing here, you know 
something about this crime.'

It's not the mother's first loss of a child to violence. Sherry West said her 18-year-old son, Shaun Glassey, was killed in New Jersey in 2008. She still has a newspaper clipping from the time.

Glassey was killed with a steak knife in March 2008 during an attack involving several other teens on a dark street corner in Gloucester County, N.J., according to news reports from the time.

'He and some other boys were going to ambush a kid,' Bernie Weisenfeld, a spokesman for the Gloucester County prosecutor's office, told the AP Friday.

Glassey was armed with a knife, but the 17-year-old target of the attack was able to get the knife away from him 'and Glassey ended up on the wrong end of the knife,' Weisenfeld recalled.

Prosecutors decided the 17-year-old would not be charged because they determined that he acted in self-defense.
