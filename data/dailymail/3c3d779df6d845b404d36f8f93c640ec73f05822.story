If you had just won the World Cup, what's the first thing you would do? Do a little dance? Drink a lot of Champagne? Or snap a selfie and share it with the world?

The German national team did all three last night... but not necessarily in that order.

In fact, long before the Eurotrance began pumping and the fizz started flowing, Germany's elated players were taking selfies with whoever would oblige.
