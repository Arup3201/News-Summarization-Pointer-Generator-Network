QPR goalkeeper Julio Cesar is in discussions over a severance payment from the Loftus Road club ahead of formalising a free transfer move to Benfica.

Cesar, 34, is on around £100,000 a week and QPR are keen to shift the Brazil international off their wage bill. 

Cesar, who played in all seven of Brazil's matches at this summer's World Cup, joined Toronto in February and made seven appearances while on loan with the Canadian outfit.

He is now set to move to the Portuguese champions after being deemed surplus to requirements at the west London outfit.

Manager Harry Redknapp is also hopeful QPR can conclude an £8million deal for Norwich midfielder Leroy Fer over the next few days. 

The Dutch international made 28 league appearances for the Canaries last season as they failed to avoid relegation.
