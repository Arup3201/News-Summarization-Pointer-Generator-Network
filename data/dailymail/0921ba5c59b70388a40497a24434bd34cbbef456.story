Zinedine Zidane believes Steven Gerrard deserves to win the Premier League title – and says he and Paul Scholes are the best two midfielders of the past 20 years.

The Real Madrid legend – now sporting director at the Bernabeu - has also revealed that his club courted the England captain when he was at the peak of his powers.

Gerrard, now 33, is only four victories away from leading Liverpool to their first championship crown in 24 years.

World beater: Zidane believes Gerrard was at one time the best midfielder on the planet

And Zidane says a title win would be just reward for Gerrard and his loyalty to the Anfield club.

‘He has had a great career winning many things - but it would be a big shame for him if he was never to win the league with Liverpool,’ said the former France star.

‘For everything that he has given - he deserves a league title.’

He went on: ‘I don't think that is any secret that Real Madrid and Chelsea had big interest in him and that is just the teams the media knew about.

‘He could have played for any team in Europe - but he turned them down. That sort of loyalty should be rewarded with a title.’

Zidane – a three-time FIFA World Player of the Year – feels Gerrard was once the best midfield player on the planet.

And rates former Manchester United schemer Scholes in a similar bracket.

‘England have probably produced the two best midfield players of the last 20 years in Steven Gerrard and Paul Scholes,’ he said.

‘There was a point when Gerrard was the best midfield player in the world. It is unusual to get complete midfield players who can do everything, but that is what he was.

‘His legs are not going to be what they were five or six years ago - but his presence and leadership are invaluable for Liverpool.’
