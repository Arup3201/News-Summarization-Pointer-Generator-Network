England will continue to develop a nastier and more cynical side to their football as they prepare for clashes with Slovenia and Scotland.

Wayne Rooney first noted the problem of England being too soft after the World Cup in Brazil, when he admitted ‘maybe we’re too honest’ compared with more streetwise opponents like Italy and Uruguay.

Roy Hodgson and his coaching team have sought to address this during the opening games of the Euro 2016 campaign and vice-captain Gary Cahill believes it is starting to make an impact.

Cahill says Jose Mourinho at Chelsea has a tendency to play nastier and develop a more cynical approach

‘We’ve been too nice in the past,’ said Cahill. ‘We’ve got a very young team and it comes with experience, knowing when to slow things down, not to always play out from the back.

‘Everybody has this philosophy of playing from the back from the keeper, but there are times to think, “Hold on, let’s not play out from the back this time, let’s kick it up the front for five or 10 minutes”.

‘There are times to kill it off, or slow things down when things aren’t going well. We will learn that. It’s just managing the game really, which maybe we are doing a lot better. It’s something that has been addressed.’

Cahill receives similar messages from his club manager Jose Mourinho at Chelsea.

‘Jose has been a master of that,’ said the centre back. ‘It’s a part of play at Chelsea and that’s because there are so many experienced players in the squad.

‘People know when to do that and not. That’s something that’s coming into the make-up with England and that’s why we are progressing.’

Cahill was outstanding in the 1-0 away win in Estonia on his last England appearance, shouldering responsibility and stepping out of the back four to get physical with opponents after a series of midfield fouls on Jack Wilshere and Jordan Henderson.

‘We are definitely a lot harder to play against,’ he added. ‘That’s about being physical, wanting to win the ball back, being aggressive and getting tight to the player.

‘It’s more physical than verbal — I don’t think that helps much — but when players are trying to hold the ball up, you’re behind them and they’re thinking, “What’s this guy doing?” That’s when they know they’re in a game.’

Coach and former England right back Gary Neville has been keen to get these points across to those stepping up to the international scene.

Cahill added: ‘He was a fantastic player in a great back four and he likes the kind of hard, tough-to-play-against, physical, almost old-school style, whereby you let the attackers or centre forward know they are in a game and feel your presence.’
