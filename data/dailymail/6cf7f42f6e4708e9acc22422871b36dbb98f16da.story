Gloves that work with touchscreens aren’t new, but they’re usually sold at a premium and have to be bought separately from your existing gloves.

A new technology claims to solve this problem by letting you turn any pair of ordinary into touchscreen ones simply by painting the fingertips with a special liquid – it also has the potential to be used with prosthetic limbs.

Called Nanotips, the liquid is made of conductive polyamide that soaks into the fabric and builds a conductive 'bridge' between your finger and the screen.

Nanotips turns ordinary gloves, stock image pictured, into touchscreen ones using a special liquid made of conductive polyamide. The liquid soaks into a variety of fabrics and creates a conductive 'bridge' between a finger and a screen. A pack costs $20 (£12) and is set to go on sale Thursday, with international shipping

The liquid is made of conductive 
polyamide that soaks into the fabric and builds a conductive ‘bridge’ 
between your finger and the screen. 

A patch needs to cover around 1sq 
inch per fingertip to work, and the liquid dries in about a minute using
 a blow dryer, for example.

The
 liquid needs to be completely dry before being used and the drying time
 varies depending on the thickness of the glove, and the material. 

A blue version is specifically designed
 to be used on fabrics and other porous materials, while the black 
version is for more durable leather and rubber gloves.

The liquid is clear - the colours relate to the packaging they are sold in.

The system isn’t perfect, though, and the liquid will eventually wear off, and will need to be reapplied.

Tony Yu, founder of Nanotips, said the patch needs to cover just  1sq inch per fingertip to work, and the liquid dries in about a minute using a blow dryer, for example.

The liquid needs to be completely dry before being used and the drying time varies depending on the thickness of the glove, and the material.

Yu, 23, from Vancouver, Canada, said: ‘I initially intended to use Nanotips with my motorcycle gloves as there wasn't a huge selection of touchscreen gloves on the market.

‘But I later realised the full potential of Nanotips and all the different applications it can be applied to.

‘So far all of the people we have demonstrated Nanotips to were amazed at how well it works.

‘A lot of people were sceptical at first but immediately changed their minds once they got to try it out themselves.’

A Nanotips pack costs $20 (£12) but can 
be used on multiple gloves.  

The  black version, pictured left, is designed for use with more durable leather and rubber gloves, for example. The blue version, pictured right, is specifically designed to be used on fabrics and other porous materials. The liquid is clear, these colours relate to the packaging they are sold in

Shipping costs $3.50 and it is due to go on sale on 20 March.The company does ship internationally.

While workers who wear gloves in their daily lives will benefit, the creators also have plans to expand into prosthetic limbs.

Nanotips also works with thick workman's gloves, stock image pictured. A blue pack contains enough liquid for up to 15 fingertips, and the black version lasts for up to 30. The system isn't perfect, though, and the liquid will eventually wear off, and will need to be reapplied

Tony said: ‘We don't just want to limit it to gloves as we discovered many prosthetic limbs are unable to interact with capacitive touchscreen devices.

‘Because touchscreen technology is such an integral part of our society, daily interactions for anyone with prosthetic hands becomes a challenge.

We would like to expand in this field by testing Nanotips on a variety of prosthetics.

‘Our goal is to give people with prosthetic limbs the ability to easily interact with touchscreen devices.’
