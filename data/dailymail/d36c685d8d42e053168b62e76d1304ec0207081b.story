Legia Warsaw's legal problems this season continued on Monday, when UEFA charged the club over a banner criticising its disputed exit from the Champions League.

The latest case follows the Polish champion's fans displaying a large image of a pig imposed on a UEFA badge and the slogan 'Because Football Doesn't Matter, Money Does.'

The banner, surrounded by lit flares, was shown before Legia's Europa League play-off victory against Aktobe of Kazakhstan last Thursday.

Not impressed: The Polish champions were booted out after fielding an ineligible player against Celtic

UEFA said its disciplinary panel will judge the case on Thursday.

Potential sanctions could be applied when Legia opens its Europa League group program at home to Lokeren on Sept. 18.

Legia was eliminated from the Champions League third qualifying round for fielding a suspended player against Celtic. UEFA awarded the Scottish side a 3-0 second-leg win that saw it advance.

The Court of Arbitration for Sport denied Legia's urgent appeal to be reinstated, and will now consider the club's request for compensation from UEFA for lost earnings.

Legia face UEFA punishment for the third time in four seasons. UEFA sanctioned fans' racist behavior by closing a section of Legia's stadium at a Champions League playoff last season.

At a home Europa League match against Hapoel Tel Aviv three years ago, fans displayed a 'Jihad Legia' banner in Arabic-style script across one end of the stadium.
