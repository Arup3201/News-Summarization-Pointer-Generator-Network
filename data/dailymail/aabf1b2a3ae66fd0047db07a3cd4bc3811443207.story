Fuel bills are set to be slashed after energy watchdog Ofgem told Britain's six biggest suppliers to overhaul their tariffs or face a mandatory cap.

The watchdog said it wanted to see 'downward pressure' on prices from the 'Big Six' EDF, E.on, British Gas, Southern, Scottish Power and npower after concerns customers are being ripped off.

Bills have doubled to £1,250 a year since 2002, with 5.5million households facing fuel poverty, in which they spend 10 per cent or more of their income on power.

Now Ofgem have ordered energy firms to make changes to confusing and expensive tariffs or endure tougher sanctions, which could include the first price controls in ten years, according to The Independent.

But the savings could come a little too late for families already choosing between heating and eating.

The watchdog said: 'Parliament has given us the task of trying to create an effective market where competition is the downward pressure on prices.

'We think that's the way to go, although we haven't ruled out regulation, particularly for more vulnerable customers, if our reforms don't work.'

This could also involve an inquiry by the Competition Commission, which could break up the dominance of the Big Six firms, who control 99 per cent of the market.

The news comes after EDF provoked outrage yesterday by revealing a huge surge in profits at a time when families are struggling to pay bills.

EDF said its operating profits rose by 8.5 per cent last year to almost £1.6billion. This is the equivalent of £427 for each of the 3.7m UK households to which the French-owned company supplies gas and electricity.

Cashing in: EDF has announced a huge profit despite lower sales

The rise came despite the ‘Big Six’ firm’s overall revenues falling by 8 per cent – as it sold less energy due to the milder winter.

Experts said the company was able to boost its profit margins because falling wholesale energy prices were not passed on in full to customers.

Consumer groups criticised the profits bonanza at EDF at a time when millions of families struggle to afford their energy bills.

Audrey Gallacher, director of energy at Consumer Focus, said: ‘EDF Energy’s UK profits have risen despite lower energy use in the milder winter.

‘This will leave many customers wondering whether energy prices can, and should, be cut further.

‘We need successful, profitable companies. But consumers need to know that big profit margins are not being made needlessly at their expense.

‘The issue is not how much money is made over one year. It is whether the market is working as a whole, pricing is fair, and if suppliers are providing enough transparency.’

The company’s statement yesterday said there had been ‘lower gas volumes sold to residential customers due to particularly mild weather’.

As a result, its sales dropped by 8 per cent to £7.1billion in 2011 – but this did not stop its operating profits rising by 8.5 per cent to £1.58billion.

Mind the gap: The price charged by the Big Six has risen despite a fall in wholesale gas prices

EDF Energy was the first of the ‘Big Six’ to announce a price cut in January, reducing gas prices by 5 per cent and triggering a domino effect among competitors. But wholesale costs had fallen by 9 per cent.

And the cut followed two price rises last year. The larger was in November when electricity prices rose by 4.5 per cent and gas by 15.4 per cent.

EDF's announcement of its financial results comes days before Centrica, owner of British Gas, will publish its results.

In 2010, profits at British Gas 
reached an all-time high of £742million and the figures for last year 
are expected be around £550m, a 25 per cent fall.

Ofgem, blasted the ‘Big Six’ as ‘greedy’, ‘bad’ and ‘lazy’ in a damning report published last March.

The industry was found guilty of manipulating prices by putting up tariffs quickly when wholesale prices rise, but delaying passing on reductions.

Yesterday consumer group Which? said there was ‘an unstoppable tide of public opinion’ demanding more affordable energy.

Hot story: British Gas is also expected to announce hefty profits of around £550m

Ofgem’s figures showed how the 
industry’s average ‘dual fuel’ bill for both electricity and gas was 
only £885 in 2008. EDF Energy’s current average was £1,129, it said.

Richard Lloyd, executive director of 
Which?, said: ‘When people see energy suppliers announcing increased 
profits despite a mild winter, they’re bound to question whether they’re
paying a fair price.

‘Millions of people are struggling with the cost of living.’

EDF Energy said: ‘We have a strong 
track record for consistently delivering some of the most competitive 
standard energy prices on the market – and crucially offering these 
during the times of year when people use the most energy.

‘In 2010, one of the coldest winters 
in living memory, we froze our prices. Last year, we were the last of 
the major suppliers to raise our prices and did so by the lowest 
amount.’

In a recent interview with this 
newspaper, EDF chief executive Vincent de Rivaz said he was doing 
everything he could to restore ‘trust’ between his company and its 
customers.

During a one-hour conversation, he used the word ‘trust’ no fewer than 61 times.

Wholesale prices peaked last autumn 
and fell throughout the winter, which led to energy giants finally 
announcing price cuts in January.
