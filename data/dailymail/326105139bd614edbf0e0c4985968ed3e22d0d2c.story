A five-year-old Louisiana girl has died after accidentally shooting herself in the head.

The New Orleans girl was at home on Sunday morning when the accident occurred.

According to New Orleans police, the girl's mother, Laderika Smith, 28, of Saint Roch, locked the girl inside the house while she went to the store.

Scene of the tragedy: The house on the 2200 block of North Galvez Street where a five-year-old fatally shot herself while home alone

When she returned, she found her daughter lying on the bedroom floor with a gunshot wound to the head.

Officers were called to the 2200 block of North Galvez St house shortly after 11am and found the girl with what police reports say is a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The girl was rushed to the hospital and her mother was charged with cruelty to a juvenile, but the little girl died of her injuries and the charge was upgraded to second-degree-murder.

Mother: Laderika Smith left her five-year-old daughter at home alone while she went to the store and returned to find the girl with a gunshot wound to the head

A police statement reported: 'A preliminary investigation indicates the child was home alone and had somehow come into contact with a .38 revolver and accidentally shot herself in the head.' 

Family members told WWLTV that they're still in the dark about what happened.

'It could have been an accident,' said family member Danielle Carter. 'I am not sure if it was an accident or not, but still, the family wants answers.'

Questions: The family of Laderika Smith say they have more questions than answers in the fatal shooting of a five-year-old girl who apparently shot herself while playing with a gun at home alone

'The family is devastated,' family member Verlenda Williams told the station. 'This is a difficult time for the whole family. It is just hard. We are just asking everyone for prayers.'

According to reports, Laderika Smith's birthday was Sunday.

Court records obtained by WWLTV report that Laderika Smith was charged with prostitution in 2010.

Police have not released the name of the child, pending notification of family members.

An autopsy has been scheduled for Monday morning.
