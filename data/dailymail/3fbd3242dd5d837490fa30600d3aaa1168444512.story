Flying cars and hover boards may be a distant dream, but you could be listening to music through a levitating speaker before Christmas.

The device comprises a tennis ball-sized ‘orb’ speaker that hovers 1.2inches (3cm) above a base thanks to an electromagnet.

The Om/One speaker will connect to your smartphone and other Bluetooth devices when it launches, so you will be able to stream music from services such as Spotify.

Users will be able to change the volume and their choice of tracks from within such apps up to 33ft (10 metres) away from the levitating speaker.

The company, which is based in Oakland, California, said: ‘OM/ONE makes the impossible possible by effortlessly defying gravity. It is elegant and meticulously engineered.’

While some people may dismiss the idea of a floating speaker as a gimmick, the team behind it said the design improves the sound quality.

‘Instead of wasting amplification energy pushing sound waves into a desk, bookshelf, or table, all of the OM/ONEs amplification energy is directed to the speaker driver to create full, crisp and clear sound,’ the company wrote on its website.

The tennis ball-sized 'orb' speakers (pictured) promises to pack a 100 decibel punch, which is the equivalent volume to a chainsaw or express train

Levitation: 1.2inches (3cm) above its base.

Sound: 100 decibels.

Connection: Bluetooth 4.0 with a range of 33ft (10 metres).

Compatibility: The device works with smartphones, PCs, Macs and other bluetooth devices.

Size: The orb measures 3.6inches (9cm) in diameter and the base, 6.3 inches (16cm) long and 1.6 inches (4cm) tall.

Weight: 0.75lbs (0.3kg) for the orb.

Power: Mains plus 15 hours playback from built-in Lithium-ion battery.

Price: $179 (£107 plus shipping) and $299 (£179) for the disco ball version.

‘This enables OM/ONE to deliver audio performance far beyond its size.’

The speaker can generate 100 decibels with a 3 watt amplifier and will offer 15 hours of playback before it needs to be recharged.

Because of this, it is portable and will be able to be used outside.

The speaker has a built-in microphone for conference calls and will be able to be used with Macs, PCs and  tablets.

‘The OM/ONE orb is designed to fit comfortably in the palm of your hand and has build quality equal to the best products you already own,’ the company said.

The speaker is available to pre-order from the firm's website in three colours: black, white and disco ball.

The plain versions cost $179 (£107 plus shipping) and the disco ball version, $299 (£179)

U.S. customers are expected to receive their speakers before Christmas, while international customers should get theirs in January.

The speaker is available to pre-order in three colours: Black, white and disco ball. The plain versions (pictured left in white) cost $179 - £107 plus shipping - and the disco ball version (pictured right) costs $299 or £179

While some people may dismiss the idea of a floating speaker as a gimmick, the team behind it said the design improves the sound quality because sound waves are not absorbed by the surface the speaker is resting on. Here. two prototypes are pictured, one of which seems to look a little like marble
