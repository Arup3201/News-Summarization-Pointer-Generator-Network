It was a day the kids of Our Lady and Saint Swithin's Catholic Primary School will never forget. The day their most famous pupil, Wayne Rooney, came back to the place where it all started.

You can tell by the beaming smiles, excited chatter and loud cheers that the England captain is a bit of a hero in these parts and these memories will definitely last a lifetime.

Rooney returned to his old primary school in Croxteth, Liverpool as part of an exclusive Sportsmail interview and photoshoot ahead of winning his landmark 100th England cap this weekend.

Our behind-the-scenes video, shot by Graham Chadwick, tells the tale of a magical day.

The school was very much prepared for his visit, with a signed England shirt hanging proudly in the reception and a replica World Cup on display.

And the 99 pupils set to take part in a very special photo with the returning hero had been kitted out in England's home and away shirts, supplied by Pro Direct Soccer.

They were all impeccably well behaved as photographer Andy Hooper took the snaps and then formed an orderly queue to get their shirt signed by the striker - the perfect souvenir of the day to treasure forever.

Headteacher Sandra Hamilton said: 'I always talk to the children about Wayne and I've always said to them one day he might come back to the school. And today was that day. He's been an absolute superstar today, he's given all his time to the children. It was like he's never been away.'

Speaking about the day, Rooney added: 'It's great to come back to the school where I went to as a young boy and see a few former teachers.

'It's great for the kids seeing someone who went to school has gone on to achieve their dreams.

'I'm really proud of where I come from and it's great that I can come back to the area. Everyone from my area is proud of what I've done.'
