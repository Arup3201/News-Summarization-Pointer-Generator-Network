An adorable video has surfaced of a koala stopping to pose for a little boy's photo before continuing to stroll down one of the main streets of a coastal town in Victoria.

Chris Kerrigan was having coffee at a café in Portland, on the south-west coast of Victoria, on Monday when she noticed the tiny marsupial walking along the footpath.

Ms Kerrigan posted a video of the koala on Facebook which has received more than 180,000 views.

She said that a young boy who was with his mother at the same café jumped up to take a photo of the koala, and the koala seemed to oblige.

'The boy had a camera in his hand and wanted to take a photo,' Ms Kerrigan told Daily Mail Australia.

'He sat down as if to say "Righto hurry up and take your photo."

'It was really interesting he wasn't the least bit phased by people around him, he looked quite calm.'

In the video the koala can be seen casually strolling past shops.

He then stops in front of a small blonde boy who is holding a camera phone and waits for him to take a picture before continuing his walk.

Ms Kerrigan, who has only recently moved to the area from South Australia, has heard that it was not uncommon to see koalas on the outskirts of the town.

'There seems to be quite a large koala population because of the vegetation around Portland,' she said,

'But it's not that common to see them walking down the footpath.'

The cute video follows reports that hundreds of koalas have been killed in secret by wildlife officials in Victoria due to concerns over starvation. 

The Victorian government euthanised 686 koalas at Cape Otway, on the same stretch of coast but about 250km west of Portland, in 2013 and 2014 in response to overpopulation in manna gum woodlands in the area.

The koalas were killed via lethal injection after being captured in trees.

Animal activists are furious and have condemned the government for their 'cruel' treatment of koalas and questioned why the program was conducted in secret.
