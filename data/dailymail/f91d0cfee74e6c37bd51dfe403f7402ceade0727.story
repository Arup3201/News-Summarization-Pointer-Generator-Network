In most girls' wedding dreams, it's usually a horse-drawn carriage or classic car that transports them to their big day.

But Heidi Underwood, 36, chose a rather more unconventional way of making the journey - in a JCB digger driven by her husband, Simon.

There was method behind the apparent madness, though - Simon drives the monster machine for a living.

Unconventional: Heidi Underwood, 32, from Birtley Grange, Carlisle, decided to arrive at her wedding to husband Simon in a JCB digger

The couple, from Birtley Grange, Carlisle, tied the knot at the city's Wigton Road Methodist Church on Saturday.

Their entrance with a difference was made for their reception at Gilsland Spa, east of Brampton.

Luckily, the bride's 'carriage' was brand new, so there was no danger of her dress getting dirty or damaged.

Heidi said she was not nervous about the novel entrance and when it was first suggested she thought it was a good idea.

She said: 'I was quite looking forward to it because it was something different. I have never seen it done before.'

Heidi said she had every confidence in Simon's skill at the controls because of his work with Alan Tuer Plant Hire.

Simon said Heidi had coped very well, and added: 'We had a little rehearsal to make sure I could do it.'

Proud father of the bride, Ken Holmes, thought Heidi's entrance was 'amazing', and said: 'I knew Simon was into diggers but I didn't think he was into them that much.

'I had every confidence in him.

'I must admit I came up to see the dry run as well. just to see what it was like. I thought it was absolutely brilliant, we couldn't have had a better day for it, and the look on people's faces was amazing.

'Not everybody knew. I knew what the idea was but until the JCB arrived I couldn't have imagined exactly how it would happen.'
