The Kansas City Chiefs paid tribute to their safety Eric Berry at Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday night during their game against the Denver Broncos.

Berry, a 25-year-old safety in his fifth season with the Chiefs, will miss the rest of the season with what the team fear could be lymphoma.

Berry experienced discomfort in his chest after Kansas City's defeat by the Oakland Raiders on November 20.

A mass was found on his chest on an MRI scan, and the team announced that he would miss the rest of the season.

On Sunday night the Chiefs hosted Peyton Manning's Denver Broncos, their AFC West rivals, and honoured their safety.

Players wore shirts with Berry's No 29 on the back during their warm-up while a message on the big screen at Arrowhead Stadium read 'be bold, be brave, be Berry'.

The Chiefs took to the field wearing red jerseys and red trousers, a look that Berry likes, rather than their normal white trousers.

Spectators also held up banners and signs in support of the 25-year-old safety.
