World Cup tickets are being put up for
 sale on the internet for as little as £9, with fans seemingly opting out of traveling to the north of the country for lesser games in 
the competition.

While 
internet prices for Brazil matches, knockout games and clashes including
 some of the more popular South American nations such as Argentina and 
Colombia are selling for up to 10 times the face value, less popular 
tickets can be bought for the price of seeing an English non-League 
side.

A steal: You can also see Honduras play Switzerland for as little as £9 in Manaus

Cheap as chips: Nigeria, who drew 2-2 with Scotland on Wednesday, can be seen for as little as £10

Ticket marketplace Viagogo.com are advertising tickets to see seeded teams Uruguay and Belgium for as little as £24, excluding booking fees and VAT.

A ticket to see Nigeria vs Bosnia in Cuiaba will set you back £9 excluding fees, little more than a pack of cigarettes. Bosnia vs Iran is £10, while Russia vs South Korea is £12.

Deflated: A ticket to see Nigeria vs Bosnia in Cuiaba will set you back £9 excluding fees

Quality on show: You could catch Luis Suarez's Uruguay for around £25 in Fortaleza against Costa Rica

Most of the cheaper tickets are for games situated in the north and north-east of Brazil, with fans seemingly unwilling to travel to see lesser clashes in Manaus, Fortaleza, Cuiaba and Salvador.

England kick-off their campaign against Italy on June 14 in Manaus, before facing Uruguay in Sao Paulo and Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte.

Tickets to see host nation Brazil are predictably highest in demand. Luiz Felipe Scolari's men face Croatia in their first game on June 12 in Sao Paulo, with Mexico and Cameroon also in Group A.

The big one: Face value tickets for the final in Rio ranged from £260 to £590
