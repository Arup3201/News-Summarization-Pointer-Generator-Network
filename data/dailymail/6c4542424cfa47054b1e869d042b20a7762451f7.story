Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers believes Luis Suarez is on course to be the world's first £100million star.

The Uruguayan has delighted the Anfield faithful this season in a free scoring side, knocking in 28 goals in the Premier League alone.

And Rodgers insists that while there is no intention to sell the striker, he would be deserving of a record valuation.

Suarez is reaching the heights of La Liga pair Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, according to the Northern Irish manager.

'He is certainly heading towards that [£100m valuation],' Rodgers told reporters.

'If you look at the top people in the world, the Ronaldos, the Messis, those who have been doing it for five or six years, he would be right at that level.

'Luis is certainly on his way towards that. His consistency has been phenomenal and what you see now is a more mature player.

'He is a world-class talent. Things evolve and times change. Time will tell.'

Suarez was close to leaving Liverpool last summer, expressing his wish to experience Champions League football, and win domestic titles.

But Rodgers has instilled a winning mentality at the club, and they are pushing Manchester City and Chelsea all the way in a tight division.
