The so-called stealth jet costing the MoD billions of pounds can, in fact, be seen by the radar of potential enemies, it has been revealed.

The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter has been designed at huge expense to fly unnoticed through enemy airspace and attack targets without being detected.

Taxpayers have already spent £1.3 billion developing the jet, while the MoD plans to buy 48 of them at a cost of up to £100 million each.

Huge cost: Taxpayers have already spent £1.3billion developing the F-35 jet, while the Ministry of Defence plans to buy 48 of them at a cost of up to £100million each

But now, defence experts have revealed that the aircraft can be spotted by Russian and Chinese radar systems.

Elizabeth Quintana, from the Royal United Services Institute, confirmed the stealth capability has been compromised and that the UK’s foes are poised to take advantage. She said: ‘There has been an evolution of radar technology and yes, we should be worried.

The Russian air defence system might be able to spot the F-35 while the technology fitted to Chinese destroyers is concerning because you will have greater resolution and you will be able to tell with greater certainty what the plane is.

‘The key question is whether the  F-35 would be able to engage first, before being spotted. How the aircraft is operated in combat will come into play.

'The Russians are making a big push in anti-aircraft technology while the combination of technologies being used by the Chinese is interesting.’

Mrs Quintana agreed that the F-35’s stealth capability had been one of its main assets. Asked how much of a blow the stealth problems are, she added:  ‘It depends what you think you’re going to come up against. You take your chances.

'The Army will argue that there is no point spending all this money and that we should be spending more on body armour and tanks.’

Future: The jets will fly from the Royal navy's new Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carrier in 2018 at a cost of £4.8billion

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond is committed to buying 48 of the jump-jet variants of the aircraft to fly from the Royal Navy’s new Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carriers from 2018, at an estimated total cost of £4.8 billion.

Until now the F-35’s invisibility – called ‘Very Low Observable’ or VLO stealth – had been achieved through its shape and paintwork, the formula for which is highly classified.

Stealth aircraft use flat surfaces and sharp edges to deflect radar signals and evade detection. The new threat  to the F-35 comes from a new system called AESA – Active Electronically Scanned Array – which works by emitting separate radio waves on different frequencies.

By rapidly changing frequencies, the radar is more difficult  to fool. China has incorporated AESA into a new radar system which it is fitting to its latest warships. The system is apparently capable of locating a stealth aircraft within 220 miles.

Military experts claim the jet, which is also used by the US Air Force, can be picked up on Russian and Chinese radars

Meanwhile, UK and US fighter pilots are continuing to test fly prototypes of the F-35 at Elgin air base in Florida.

Test flights have also revealed computer software problems and performance issues when the aircraft is flown in bad weather – including fears that the jet could explode if struck by lightning. Pilots have also criticised their high-tech helmets.

The jet, which as a top speed of 1,300mph and a maximum range of 1,450 miles, combines technologies developed by British and US companies, including BAE, Rolls-Royce and Lockheed Martin, which is assembling the jets.

Last night, the company was unavailable for comment, but the MoD said: ‘[F-35] is the most advanced combat jet in the world, and from 2018 will provide the Royal Navy and RAF with unprecedented stealth capability  as well state-of-the-art sensors and weapons. The aircraft has been specifically designed to be updated throughout its lifetime to ensure it  can benefit from new technology to counter emerging threats and keep ahead of our enemies.’
