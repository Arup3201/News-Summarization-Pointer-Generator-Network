The ice-bucket challenge has been making more headlines and, as someone who found themselves nominated to do it, I can confirm it is not something you would want to do twice.

I found myself nominated by a fellow England player and had no intention of pulling out,so I got drenched at Melwood, Liverpool’s training ground, earlier this week and I quickly handed the baton over to Craig Noone, the Cardiff City winger.

Let me explain why I chose him: Craig is a good lad from Liverpool, who has played for a number of clubs and is working hard to recover from injury.

While he was starting out as a footballer, he worked as a roofer part-time and he did some work in my house.

As there is a hole in my roof, Craig should appreciate why he received my nomination — and I’m glad he accepted it!

Seriously, though, it is a great cause and this is all being done in good spirit.
