A man was engulfed in a fireball and rushed to hospital covered in burns after he blocked up mouseholes in his flat with aerosol foam before trying to light his oven.

Over the course of two days, the man attempted to stop rodents from getting into his flat in Acton, west London, by filling any holes with eight cans worth of expanding foam. 

But he had failed to ventilate his home properly, and when he tried to switch on the gas cooker in his kitchen the propellant used in the spray cans ignited and burst into flames.

A witness told fire investigators that the man was 'engulfed in a ball of fire'. He suffered burns to his hands and arms that required hospital treatment.

Around ten fire-fighters from Acton and Ealing fire stations were called to the flat at around 1pm on Sunday, with two fire engines deployed to the scene.

London Fire Brigade said the man had used the foam to plug gaps around the cooker and skirting boards in his kitchen.  

But the expanding foam contained the highly flammable propellant gas, methylene-diphenyl-diisocyanate 4,4'.

The expanding foam, pictured underneath the cooker, contained the highly flammable propellant gas, methylene-diphenyl-diisocyanate 4,4', which is thought to have ignited when he switched on the oven

The gas is emitted from the foam as it expands and dries out, and as it is heavier than air, sinks and forms an invisible cloud.

It is believed that the gas ignited when the man switched on the cooker.

A fire brigade spokesman said the fire had been brought under control within ten minutes, and the man had been taken to hospital but was now recovering at home. 

'Always read safety warnings on the side of aerosol cans and observe the safety advice closely,' the spokesman added.

'Areas where expanding foam is drying out should always be very well ventilated.'
