Walmart has come under fire for refusing to print a photo of mother breastfeeding her baby.

As a gift for her first mother's day, Kayla Andre's husband had requested that the Photo Center at the store's branch in Spruce Grove, Alberta, Canada, print the touching image with the words 'Two Hearts Entwined Forever.'

But when he arrived to collect it, staff told him that it violated the store's nudity policy, and so they were unable to create the print for him.

'When he went to go pick it up, they brought the photo out and said 
unfortunately, although this means a lot to you, we canâ€™t print it for 
you and we cannot sell it to you,' Mrs Andre told CTV Edmonton.

'He said, well why not, and they said because itâ€™s nudity and Walmart has very strict no nudity policy.'

Mrs Andre's furious husband posted a complaint on Facebook, while she herself began planning a nurse-in at the store with fellow mothers.

'Breastfeeding
 is natural, it's normal, it's beautiful... My photo has no sexual 
connotation at all, and here it is getting denied'

She said: 'Breastfeeding
 is natural, it's normal, it's beautiful . . . My photo has no sexual 
connotation at all, and here it is getting denied.'

Walmart was quick to acknowledge the error, though and Canadian corporate affairs director Alex Roberton personally called the couple to apologize.

He admitted: 'We made a mistake. That photo should have been printed.'

Explaining the situation further, he told CTV that store policy probably had not been well-explained to young and new photo center employees.

'In this particular case, we hadn't done a very good job of making 
sure that procedure was crystal clear,' he said.

He added that Walmart would be amending policy guidelines for employees in the wake of the debacle.

Mrs Andre says that her planned nurse-in will still go ahead, but instead of a protest it will be a celebration with Walmart's support.

On the event's Facebook page, she wrote: 'We will be there ... to 
celebrate breastfeeding and show others that Walmart is a reasonable 
company who listens to their customers! They have clarified their policy
 and that is something to celebrate!'

Mr Roberton says each of the 29 local moms taking part will get a gift certificate for the Walmart Photo Center.
