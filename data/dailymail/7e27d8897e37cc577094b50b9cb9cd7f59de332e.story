Free: The corruption case against John Edwards was dropped on Wednesday after a mistrial was declared in the case last month

The remaining charges against former senator John Edwards have been dropped, the U.S. Justice Department said today.

A jury in North Carolina acquitted the former presidential candidate last month on one count of accepting illegal campaign contributions. It deadlocked on five other felony counts, resulting in a mistrial on those charges.

Edwards was accused of masterminding a 
scheme to use $1million in secret payments from two wealthy 
political donors to hide mistress Rielle Hunter and their lovechild as 
he sought the White House in 2008.

A statement issued today said federal prosecutors will not seek to retry Edwards on the five unresolved counts following his trial in Greensboro, North Carolina.

Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. 
Breuer, who oversees the Justice Department's criminal division, said 
prosecutors knew the case, like all those involving campaign finances, 
would be challenging.

But he said it is 'our duty to bring hard cases' when warranted.

Mr
Breuer said: 'Last month, the government put forward its best case 
against Mr. Edwards, and I am proud of the skilled and professional way 
in which our prosecutors... conducted this trial.'

The Justice Department had spent millions of dollars of taxpayers' money on the prosecution of the former U.S Senator.

It was announced yesterday that Edwards' former lover Ms Hunter is set to give a tell-all interview on June 22.

She will open up about her affair with the former North Carolina Senator and his 
relationship with the couple's four-year-old daughter Quinn.

Revelations: John Edwards' former mistress Rielle Hunter is set to speak publicly for the first time on June 22 about their relationship

Rielle
Hunter was not called to give evidence at the corruption trial and she 
has not spoken about her affair with Edwards until now.

Edwards'
lawyers - Abbe Lowell, Allison Van Laningham and Alan W Duncan - said 
in a statement that they are pleased with the Government's decision not 
to seek a second trial that they believe would have had the same 
outcome.

It read: 'While 
John has repeatedly admitted to his sins, he has also consistently 
asserted, as we demonstrated at the trial, that he did not violate any 
campaign law nor even imagined that any campaign laws could apply.

'We are very glad that, after living 
under this cloud for over three years, John and his family can have 
their lives back and enjoy the peace they deserve.'

Anticipation: Rielle Hunter, pictured with her and John Edwards' daughter Quinn in January, has written a book about their affair

John Edwards emerged from the court 
house on May 31 after the six-week trial saying that he was grateful to all of his children - 
including his 'precious Quinn' - the child from his affair with Ms 
Hunter.

The disgraced senator was 
sensationally found not guilty verdict for count three - the charge that
Edwards accepted and received illegal campaign contributions from 
Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon.

The trial exposed a sordid sex 
scandal that unfolded while Edwards' wife Elizabeth was dying of cancer 
but prosecutors couldn't convince jurors that he had masterminded a $1 million cover-up of 
his affair.

Elizabeth Edwards died of cancer in December 2010.

John Edwards could have served up to 30 years in prison and $1.5 million in fines if convicted of all charges.

Edwards' woes began when he met Ms 
Hunter, now 48, when she came to work as a videographer for his 2004 
presidential campaign. The pair started a romantic relationship while 
they were on the road.

Dressed in a short, printed dress 
with 
bare legs and wedge heels, she was pictured for the first time since 
Edwards' trial last night being interviewed by Chris Cuomo for 
ABC's 20/20. The show will air next 
Friday, June 22. 

Ms 
Hunter's own personal narrative is as fascinating as the ensuing 
campaign scandal. She was a muse for Manhattan’s 90s literary scene and 
author of Bright Lights, Big City Jay McInerney based a ‘cocaine-addled,
sexually voracious’ character on Hunter.

By the time she met Edwards in a New York hotel bar in 2006, she was a convert of new age philosophies and mysticism.

She walked up to him, said, 'You’re so hot', and ended the conversation by passing him her business card which read: 'Rielle Hunter: Being is free'.

After the pair began their romantic liaison, she fell pregnant and agreed with the plan to have Edwards’ long-time aide Andrew Young claim paternity in an effort to keep Edwards’ political prospects alive.

Until now, no one has heard her full version of events as she did not testify during Edwards' trial.

The slew of interviews next week are to accompany Ms Hunter's book What Really Happened: John 
Edwards, Our Daughter, and Me which hits the shelves on June 
26.
