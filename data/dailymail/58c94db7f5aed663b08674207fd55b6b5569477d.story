Police spent £2,000 sending a van and two officers to investigate a cat that stole a chicken from an elderly woman’s kitchen, it was claimed today.

Dorothy Howling-Neame, 75, of Folkestone, Kent, called the authorities after her neighbours’ Bengal broke into her house through a cat flap.

Kent Police officers turned up at the doorstep of Janine and Paul Watson to question them about their pet cat Pebble, leaving the couple stunned.

‘I asked how much it cost taxpayers to send two of them out,’ Mrs Watson, 46, told the Sun. ‘He said the average was about £2,000. It’s absurd.

‘This country is in enough disarray without police being called out over a cat.’

But Ms Howling-Neame said the cat burglar regularly made its way into her house through a catflap and said she was correct to call the police.

‘It goes for my cats,’ she told the Sun. ‘The last straw came when it went for the chicken.’

A Kent Police spokesman told MailOnline that the woman was concerned about 'a perceived threat, which she said was affecting her quality of life’.

He added that police attended for this reason - ‘and not because of any issues to do with a cat’.

'Officers spoke to the caller and a neighbour to stop any potential dispute from escalating'

The spokesman said: ‘The threat was not immediate so an appointment was booked at the caller's convenience for the following day. Officers spoke to the caller and a neighbour to stop any potential dispute from escalating.

'Officers did not attend in a riot van. Neither officer confirmed or gave a cost of their visit.’

Earlier this year a mischievous pet became known as ‘Denis the Menace’ after stealing more than 100 garments from nearby homes and gardens.

The real-life cat burglar swiped all manner of items, which he took home to his embarrassed owner Lesley Newman, 49, in Luton, Bedfordshire.
