A baby elephant has been trampled to death by its mother just moments after she gave birth.

New mother Bibi stomped on her newborn baby at a zoo in Halle, Germany, before keepers could intervene.

Bibi became distressed after giving birth to the calf and the brutal attack began. She stamped on it, before flinging its body around with her trunk.

Keepers had not expected any trouble as Bibi was an experienced mother and the youngster was her third calf.

They and animal lovers around Germany had been waiting eagerly for the birth of the new baby.

The zoo is home to four cows and a bull elephant.

Its enclosure has an outdoor area of 3,000 square metres and a swimming pool for African elephant bull Abu and the elephants Mafuta, Tana, Bibi and her calf Panya.

As elephants are so tactile and sociable, a mother rejecting their newborn appears very unusual.

Typically, an expecting mother will seek out another female elephant in her herd who will help her when she gives birth and offer her protection.

The phenomenon could be linked to the mother suspecting the calf had a deformity or just the psychological distress of labour.

The gruesome incident echoed a similar
one in China last week, when zookeepers were forced to intervene after a female 
elephant attempted to stamp her calf to death shortly after he was born.

The female elephant had stepped on baby Zhuangzhuang almost immediately after giving birth at a Chinese zoo on August 30.

Zoo keepers initially thought it was an 
accident. They removed the calf to treat his injuries and returned him 
to his mother two hours later - but she started to stamp on him again.

Keepers drove her off and took the little elephant away.

The
rejected calf then reportedly cried for five hours as staff at the 
Shendiaoshan Wild Animal Natural Reserve Area, in Rongcheng, Shandong 
province, tried to comfort him.

To be rejected at birth causes an elephant extreme psychological distress, wildlife trusts say.

Elephants find it extremely important to be part of a family group, and require intimacy, company and comfort to be stable.

Psychological
grief can trigger life threatening problems such as diarrheoa in infant
elephants, who are extremely fragile during their milk dependency period, the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust warns.

They are tactile and sensitive, and require a human adoptive family who will provide them with around-the-clock care and attention.

Orphan elephants are normally reintroduced into the wild once they are grown and deemed ready to successfully integrate with a herd.

The baby elephant who cried after his mother's vicious attack touched the hearts of millions who saw his anguish on video. He is now making good progress and has been adopted by a keeper.
