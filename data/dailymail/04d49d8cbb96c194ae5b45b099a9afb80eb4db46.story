Barack and Chris looked like the best of friends, sharing a warm embrace and laughing as they took a stroll together.

But one is an under-fire Democrat president reeling from a series of devastating economic blows, and the other is a Republican who could end up being the man to usurp his new best friend.

The meeting to survey Hurricane Irene’s damage came as it was claimed New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is 'actively considering' entering the race to become the Republican presidential nominee.

Former George W. Bush speechwriter Michael Gerson said on Sunday the Garden State governor was weighing up running as some voters and GOP insiders voice discontent at the current field.

Republicans are said to be sceptical about frontrunner Mitt Romney’s candidacy, with many believing the former Massachusetts governor is not equipped with enough skills for the job.

Others say Rick Perry might be doing well in the polls but voters do not know what to expect from the Texas Governor - and cannot put their finger on anyone who would be good enough for the job.

The White House is not believed to be seriously concerned about any Republican candidates for the 2012 presidency - but Mr Obama’s team is worried Governor Christie could represent a big threat.

'I don't think Republicans regard this as a strong field,' Mr Gerson told ABC.

'Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey was in Chicago and had two meetings with serious Republican groups from the Midwest. He is actively, I think, considering getting in this race, which would throw things open once more'

‘So there is still talk of people getting in the race. Not just (Sarah) Palin but last week, Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey was in Chicago and had two meetings with serious Republican groups from the Midwest.

'He is actively, I think, considering getting in this race, which would throw things open once more. But the desire for that to happen (shows) that they are not happy with the current field.’

Governor Christie has won major plaudits for his authoritative command of preparations for Hurricane Irene and the following clean-up.

But he has also won many friends for his blunt, emotive and humorous style that has got him noticed locally and nationally.

'Get the hell off the beach'

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie to surfers before Hurricane Irene hit 

In what has become the most famous quote of Irene, after seeing people surfing on the beach in television interviews, Governor Christie's frustration came through.

'Get the hell off the beach,' he told surfers in a memorable press conference that was replayed on news programmes around the country.

But Governor Christie has still not uttered any public signs to suggest he is thinking about running - and has instead insisted that he is not interested.

'Short of suicide, I don't really know what I'd have to do to convince you people that I'm not running,' he told reporters last November at a press conference in Trenton, New Jersey.
