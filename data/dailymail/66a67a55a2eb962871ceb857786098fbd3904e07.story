Thousands of pelicans dive-bombed a busy beach in Ecuador to hunt for food while bemused swimmers watched on.

One woman hastily led her child away from the hungry birds as they swooped down on the beach. 

But the pelicans weren't interested in the humans and made a beeline for the shoal of fish swimming along the shore.

While some bathers hurried back to the beach, others are seen wading into the water to catch a closer glimpse of the phenomenon.

Almost in formation, the pelicans dive into the water one after another to catch the sardines.

Fisherman Maximiliano Ricci, who travelled to Crucita in Ecuador from Italy for a holiday, captured the feeding frenzy on camera.

He told GrindTV that the birds were chasing fish swimming in the midst of the holidaymakers.

The pelicans are almost formation as they repeatedly dive into the water to catch the sardines

Mr Ricci said: 'Even the locals were amazed at the scene. The sardines were pursued along the coast and the entire scene lasted for about an hour.' 

Pelicans hunt for prey by swooping over the sea and scooping fish into their large beak pouch. They then drain the water before guzzling the food whole.
