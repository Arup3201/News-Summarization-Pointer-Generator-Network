The former Beautiful South singer Paul Heaton has resigned as a charity patron of Sheffield United over the club's decision to allow convicted rapist Ched Evans to return to training. 

The singer, who said he made the decision with 'great regret', said the club needed 'to lift its reputation out of the gutter'.

He joins TV presenter Charlie Webster, sixties pop star Dave Berry and Sheffield businesswoman Lindsay Graham, who have all resigned as patrons of the club since the decision was made.

He made the statement today via his Facebook page where he told fans he saluted the bravery of his fellow patrons.

He added: 'I firmly believe that Ched Evans has the right to rebuild his career in football but rebuilding a career should not involve walking straight out of prison and into the shirt of the club he so badly let down.

'I believe he needs to move away and move on, and the club itself needs to lift its reputation out of the gutter.'  

Last week the 25-year-old footballer was offered the chance to train with his former club Sheffield United after he was released from jail last month, having served half his five-year rape sentence. 

But the decision sparked a backlash from a series of high-profile supporters, including Jessica Ennis-Hill, who said she would ask for her name to removed from  the club's ground if he returns full-time.

He was expected to start playing football again  last Tuesday, but is yet to turn up. 

Support: The father of Natasha Massey,left,  Ched Evans' fiancee, will offer him a job if his football comeback fails, it has emerged

It has since been reported that the club may not offer the Welsh international a new contract because he is considered 'toxic'. 

However, it emerged today that if his return to football is blocked, he will be offered a day job by his fiancee's millionaire father.

Natasha Massey's father is likely to give him a role at his empire, which includes high-end jewellers and a staff rewards ­business, if his football comeback fails, the Mirror said. 

A source told the paper that Karl Massey said there would always be a job for Evans at one of his firms.

They added: 'He believes 100 per cent in Ched's ­innocence, otherwise he wouldn't ­sanction him still dating his daughter or have given them his blessing to marry.'

It has been reported that Mr Massey, 50, has paid for a PR campaign which protests Evans' innocence. 

He is also said to have hired lawyers to present new evidence to the Criminal Cases Review ­Commission in a bid to overturn his conviction. 

The statement by Paul Heaton was posted on his Facebook page today where he announced his resignation

Meanwhile Sheffield United have admitted they are 'appalled' by the abuse being aimed at people who have criticised the club's decision to allow convicted rapist Evans back to training.

Twitter abuse was aimed at Olympic heptathlon champion and local hero Jessica Ennis-Hill, who said that to allow Evans back into the Blades squad would 'completely contradict' her beliefs of being a role model to young people.

She asked for her name to removed from a stand at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane ground if the club takes back Evans.

'I believe being a role model to young people is a huge honour and those in positions of influence in communities should respect the role they play in young people's lives and set a good example,' she said.

'If Evans was to be re-signed by the club, it would completely contradict these beliefs.'

Within hours she was taunted with several sick tweets including one saying: 'I hope he (Evans) rapes her.'

The League One club have pledged to work with South Yorkshire Police who are investigating the abuse. 

People who send this kind of abuse on social media or when chanting at grounds should not feel safe to make these personal attacks, the club said.

Last week the 25-year-old returned to training with his former club Sheffield United after he was released from jail last month, having served half his five-year rape sentence 

He was released from prison last month after serving half of the five-year sentence.

An appeal against his conviction was rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in 2012. His case is due to be looked at by the Criminal Cases Review Commission.

After his release, Evans put a video on his website protesting his innocence and vowing to clear his name.

South Yorkshire Police said on Friday: 'South Yorkshire Police can confirm they are investigating reports of abusive tweets. Officers are making efforts to contact the individual concerned, but have launched an investigation into the posts.' 

Ennis-Hill, a United fan, had a stand at Bramall Lane named in her honour after she won gold at the London 2012 Olympics.

Backlash: There has been huge support for a campaign to stop Evans returning to his former club, and other believe as he has only served half his five-year sentence a ban should last for at least that period

Campaigners against sexual violence have criticised the club's decision to allow Evans, 25, to train with the team. 

Wales international Evans was jailed in April 2012 for raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room in Rhyl, North Wales.

The striker denied raping the woman, saying the sex was consensual, but he was found guilty by a jury at Caernarfon Crown Court.
