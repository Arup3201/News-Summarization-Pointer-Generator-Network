Conservative commentators, so often a backbone of broadcasting support for Tony Abbott, have turned on the embattled PM, with Ray Hadley insisting on Thursday that he made 'a really bad call' to proceed with the mid-year budget update during the Sydney siege on Monday.

Mr Hadley joined the chorus of criticism about Mr Abbott, telling him in the 2GB Ray Hadley Show interview that: 'I thought until about a month ago, you were going B-plus, I think you're now a D-minus'.

'I thought that was a really bad call,' the broadcaster told the PM. 'We had seventeen people in there whose lives were at risk.

Treasurer Joe Hockey was given the go-ahead to hand down his mid-year economic and fiscal outlook, which only brought more bad news, showing even larger deficits across the four-year estimates than were predicted back in May. 

Some financial analysts believe that since the pre-election economic and fiscal outlook of August 2013, the budget position has deteriorated by almost $93 billion, it's estimated that the government's failed attempts to negotiate the budget through the Senate has, alone, come at a cost of some $10 billion.

'I made the call (to go ahead with the mid-year review) some people thought it was a good call, obviously some people didn't,' Mr Abbott countered.

Tony Abbott used a sporting analogy to concede the government's 'fans in the stands' are unhappy.

'But my job is not so much to be worrying about the scoreboard,' the prime minister added.

Even News Corporation columnist Andrew Bolt recently took a shot at the Coalition, writing that the PM was making the 'same blunders that killed Julia Gillard'.

Mr Bolt, was referring to the government's broken Budget promise not to slash the ABC budget, said 'what is so frustrating for those who wish Abbott well is that this disaster was utterly predictable - and, indeed, predicted'.

'In April, even though it killed me, I warned through gritted teeth that the government should honour its promise to the ABC.'

'I thought that was a really bad call,' broadcaster Ray Hadley told the PM. 'We had seventeen people in there whose lives were at risk.'

On The Ray Hadley Morning Show, the PM said of his performance, rated a 'D minus' by the host, that 'if I score myself high, people think I'm full of myself. If I score myself low, people think I'm lacking in self-confidence'.

'I know there are about 23 million judges out there, and I leave each of them to make their own judgement,' he said.

Just over two weeks ago, the Prime Minister admitted the his government had had a 'ragged week'.

He said at the time, on the back of the ABC cuts, inability to get the Medicare co-payment through and internal rumblings about the Treasurer, 'that 'I'd be the first to admit that last week was a bit of ragged week for the government, I'd be the first to admit that'.

'I know that appearances do count and I do concede that the appearance last week was a bit ragged - in the end nothing matters more than performance,' he said at the time.

The woe has seemingly continued, as even Mr Abbott conceded it had been a 'ragged conclusion' to the year.

'I carefully considered it (to go ahead with the mid-year budget announcement) and I made the call that the ordinary business of government should go on,' he told Mr Hadley.

'Some people thought it was a good call. Obviously some people didn't and you're in that latter group.'

The Government has for months lagged behind the Labor Opposition in opinion polls, with its unpopular budget largely to blame.

Mr Abbott admits many of those who voted for the Coalition in 2013 are now unhappy with the government, with much of its agenda being held up in the Senate.

'A lot of people who are willing the government to succeed, get a little frustrated when they think that maybe it's not succeeding,' he said.

'It's our fans in the stands looking at what they think is the scoreboard and thinking `Gee wiz, the team ought to be in front, but it's not'.'

The government has been beset by internal problems plus confusion over the Medicare co-payment, the defeat of university funding reform, anger over defence force pay and a devastating Victorian state election loss.

But Mr Abbott asked voters to ignore the 'critical chatter'.
