There are only four days until the first shoppers get their hands on an iPhone 5.

But for those who have pre-ordered, they can watch their phone make its way slowly from overseas from China, with crates stacked high with iPhones due to land in both the U.S. and UK by the end of the week.

Fans have been using the UPS delivery company's website to figure out when their phone will arrive, and by doing so have shown that that the first shipments left ZhengZhou in China yesterday.

If people still want more information, then Apple has released detailed specifications about the phone, to allow third-party manufacturers to create cases for the phone.

Waiting for your iPhone 5? This is what you will be getting: Apple has released these specifications of its new device

The specifications show every individual measurement of the iPhone - from the width of the lens to the spaces around the buttons.

This means that third-party case-makers can get to work creating different covers for the phone, and a rush of covers are now likely to start appearing on eBay and other merchant websites.

Apple states its design aims and warnings to manufacturers with the specifications.

The company says that 'a well-designed case will securely house an Apple device while not interfering with the device’s operation.

'Significant factors in mechanical design include access to the device’s sensors, controls, and connectors.

'A case that encroaches too closely on the perimeter of any camera lens may produce image degradation, even without obstructing the lens. The case should not cause contrast decrease, color shift, image blocking, or flash interference through any camera lens.'

To show the care Apple puts into ensuring a premium experience, it even offers a template against which manufacturers can take pictures to ensure image degradation does not take place.

The avid buyers who have pre-ordered their iPhone have used UPS's order page as well as Apple's serial code checker to tease out new facts about their phones.

For instance, the earliest manufacturing date discovered so far is August 5th-11th - showing just how tightly Apple runs its ship.

An estimated 50million iPhone 5s are likely to be sold over the next year, meaning all of Apple's factories are outputting at maximum capacity to supply demand.

Meanwhile, for those who want their hands on the first model, be warned that queues have already started forming outside Apple Shops in London and New York in preparation for the official launch this Friday.
