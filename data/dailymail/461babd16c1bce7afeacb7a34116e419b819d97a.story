Full-skirted ballgowns were, quite literally, the biggest red carpet trend at the Oscars last night.

Amy Adams, Jennifer Lawrence and Fan Bingbing lead the princess-like trend with dresses boasting layers and layers of tulle, making their skirts wide as they are tall.

Jennifer Lawrence's was undoubtedly the most showstopping. As the newest face of Christian Dior, she was lucky enough to wear an haute couture gown by the French fashion house's new creative director Raf Simons, and Chopard jewels including a fine necklace that cascaded down her back.

A fashion fairytale: Amy Adams wore a dove grey Oscar de la Renta gown with a full and feathery skirt made up of cascading ruffles

She was followed swiftly in the 
ballgown size - and style - stakes by Amy Adams, who wore a dove grey 
Oscar de la Renta gown with a full and feathery skirt made up of 
cascading ruffles. The look was deemed 'a fairytale' by Vogue UK, and 
they weren't the only ones to rate it.

Less ethereal, but no less sensational was the Marchesa gown worn by Fan Bingbing. The searing hue was given edge by the sculptural folds of satin at the bodice, exposing ravishing embroidery at the back.

Also braving bright shades were Sally Field and Jennifer Aniston, both of whom opted for punchy reds courtesy of Valentino.

Of course the princess look probably felt most special for the stars young enough to enjoy a fairytale. Youngest-ever Academy Award nominee Quvenzhane Wallis, nine, had a dress made for her by Giorgio Armani, complete with matching stole. The dog-shaped bag is one she already owned.

Curfew actress Fatima Ptacek, 12, also worked the look to great effect in Bonnie Young - the creation had a lace top and almost tutu-like frills by way of a skirt. The youngster played on the look with her hair in a high bun.

Wearing full-skirted gowns to a less dramatic degree were Kristen Chenoweth and Kelly Osbourne, both in Tony Ward Couture and Octavia Spencer in Tadashi Shoji.

That wasn't where the red carpet trends ended though.

From ink-like hues to shimmering gold statuette-like gowns, there were plenty more themes - the most dazzling looks courtesy of those who dared to be different without ending up on worst-dressed lists.

Here are a few of our favorites...

GETTING THE INKY BLUES

Ink-like hues spanned in spectrum from rich royal blue to navy. Reese Witherspoon in Louis Vuitton and Jennifer Hudson in Roberto Cavalli were the leaders of this trend, though it was also seen on Quvenzhane Wallis, a radiant Robin Roberts in Marc Bouwer and Helen Hunt, the latter of whom surprised style-watchers by wearing a gown from H&M.

CHANNELLING OSCAR

What is the Academy 
Awards red carpet without some statuette-like shimmering column gowns. 
The gilded look is always a favorite, and this year was no different, with 
Halle Berry, Naomi Watts, Jessica Chastain, Renee Zellweger and 
Catherine Zeta Jones just a few of the stars to dazzle in it.

One that stood out was Naomi Watts, whose silver Armani Prive gown was a surefire winner for its incredible cutaway neckline.

PALE AND INTERESTING

Academy Award-winner Anne Hathaway looked like a modern-day Audrey Hepburn with her cropped dark hair and high-necked Prada column gown. It was perfect in its simplicity, but no doubt anything but to construct.

Zoe Saldana's Alexis Mabille dress, with layers of grey peeking from beneath was refreshingly different, and Charlize Theron's Christian Dior Haute Couture was so sharp and sculptural, it seemed fashioned from paper.
