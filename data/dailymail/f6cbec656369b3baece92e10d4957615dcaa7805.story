Fish and chip shops regularly source cheaper species of fish before selling them to customers as cod and haddock, according to a food safety expert.

An investigation conducted by Which? discovered that around one in six of the fish sold in UK takeaways was labelled incorrectly.

The consumer watchdog took DNA samples from 45 portions of cod or haddock bought in shops in Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow.

An investigation conducted by Which? discovered that around one in six fish sold in UK takeaways was labelled incorrectly

Seven were found to be mislabelled, with whiting - often used in fish meal and pet food - the most common substitute.

The findings follow the watchdog's larger survey into lamb takeaways, where they discovered that 40 per cent of meals they bought were either contaminated with other meats or did not contain any lamb at all.

They are now urging the Government, the Food Standards Agency and local authorities to do more to tackle the issue and in April launched a campaign called Stop Food Fraud.

Last week, it was announced that a new Food Crime Unit will be established to crack down on criminal activity in the food industry.

The move came in response to recommendations made in the Elliott Review, a government-commissioned investigation that was launched in the aftermath of last year's horse-meat scandal. 

Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘Consumers must be put first if we are to restore trust in the food industry.

'It's in the interests of responsible food businesses, as well as consumers, to make sure there are effective controls in place and a zero tolerance approach to food crime. 

Whiting - used in fish meal and pet food - is often served as British favourites cod and haddock 

'We now want the government to quickly implement all of the recommendations so consumers can be confident in the food they buy.' 

The Which? study is not the first time that fraud has been exposed in the seafood industry.

Last year, marine protection group, Oceana, published research showing that a third of fish in supermarkets, shops and restaurants in the U.S. was wrongly labelled.

In 120 'red snapper' samples, 28 different species of fish were found, including 17 not even from the snapper family. 

Another study by Boston Globe in 2011, found that almost half the fish they tested from supermarkets and restaurants was labelled incorrectly.

Amazingly, every single sample of tuna turned out to be another variety of fish - in many cases escolar, which looks and tastes similar.
