A hard-up police force is considering closing some of its police stations and asking victims of crime to Skype officers instead in a bid to save money.

Bedfordshire Police are under pressure to make £7.5m in financial savings following cutbacks in government funding.

And the force's Police and Crime Commissioner Olly Martins has now said they unnecessarily spend £3m-a-year funding under-used police stations.

The Labour-affiliated PCC has now made the unpopular suggestion of axing some of its stations.

Mr Martins says people could get in touch with police instead via the free internet video service Skype.

A survey has now been sent out to homes across the county requesting families' views on the proposal.

Mr Martins said: 'It's just an idea but we would presumably have a Skype address for the force control room or there might be scope for having it more locally based.

Alternative: Victims of crime will be encouraged to report incidents via services such as Skype

'We know we have got £7.5 million to save in the next two years and that police stations in total across the county cost us £3m a year.

"It is possible some smaller ones would be the ones to go just because the front desk is quiet - some of them barely have three or four people come in a day.

'The first thing I wanted to do was test the public mood and see how open people are to the idea and in what ways they access the police service.'

Public opinion on the proposal is expected to be fed back to police chiefs in October.
