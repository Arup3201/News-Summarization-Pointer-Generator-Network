The destruction of a small Russian satellite shows the growing threat space junk poses to activities in low-Earth orbit, experts have warned.

Russia's Ball Lens In The Space nanosatellite is thought to have been obliterated by a collision with a piece of debris left spinning around the planet by a Chinese anti-satellite weapon test in 2007.

The Earth is surrounded by an ever-growing cloud of space junk, which Nasa has estimated contains 500,000 objects bigger than a marble, and 22,000 bigger than a cricket ball.

With the debris in low-Earth orbit spinning around the planet at speeds of about 17,500mph, even tiny pieces can cause serious damage to satellites and pose a deadly hazard to astronauts.

Some 70 per cent of catalogued space junk objects are in low-Earth orbit, which extends to 1,250 miles about the surface of our planet.

To be able to observe the Earth, spacecraft must orbit at such a low altitude - any further and their instruments are unable to pick out details.

The latest collision happened six weeks ago, on January 22, and is just the latest case of space junk destroying human technology in space.

Brian Weeden, a technical adviser with the Secure World Foundation, which is campaigns for the peaceful use of space technology, told Space.com: 'It's not the wake-up call — we've had too many of those already.

'Many satellites in LEO [low-Earth orbit] are having to maneuver on a regular basis to avoid threatening close approaches with debris.

'This is just one more data point that shatters the myth of the "big sky" theory regarding space activities and shows that debris is one of the most pressing threats satellite operators in LEO have to contend with.'

Mr Weeden cited a 2009 article by David Wright of the Union of Concerned Scientists which documents three previous suspected cases of collisions between active satellites and space junk in 1996, 2007 and 2009.

Since the first object, Sputnik One, was launched into space 53 years ago, mankind has created a swarm of perhaps tens of millions of items of debris.

The rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets, abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel.

It is estimated that there are 500,000 pieces of space junk floating in Earth's orbit.

The picture above shows a ball of twisted metal, thought to be fallen space junk, on a farm in Queensland, Australia, in 2008.

Dr Wright, co-director of the union's Global Security Programme, wrote: 'Because of the large number of active satellites in space (more than 900) and the very large amount of debris, we estimate that a collision between a piece of debris larger than 1cm (0.4in) with some active satellite in a near-Earth orbit would occur on average every two to three years over the next decade (prior to several debris-producing events in 2007, our estimate was a collision every five to six years).

'The observed collisions in 1996, 2007, and 2009 seem to roughly agree with this estimate.'

One such 'debris-producing event' referred to by Dr Wright in his article was, of course the testing of an anti-satellite missile by China in 2007.

The country used a missile to destroy a weather satellite more than 500 miles above the Earth in a show of military might that is thought to have added about 3,000 pieces of debris to the space junk cloud surrounding our planet.

Diplomatic documents leaked by Wikileaks later revealed that the U.S. warned China it could take military action in response to Beijing’s use of space missiles.

And it emerged that the U.S. even shot down one of its own satellites to demonstrate its ballistic power after China's missile test.

Don Kessler, the former head of NASA's Orbital Debris Office, told Space.com the space junk problem is still manageable, since satellite operators can take precautions to safeguard their spacecraft.

However, he added, the danger is increasing and, if no agreement can be made to limit the amount of rubbish left in orbit such minor precautions will no longer be enough.
