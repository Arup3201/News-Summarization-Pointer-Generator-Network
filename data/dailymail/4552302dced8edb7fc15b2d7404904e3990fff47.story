Police in Saudi Arabia are hunting a gang who stole a tiger, a leopard and a jaguar.

The burglars smashed security cameras, disabled the alarm and knocked out the animals with a dart gun at a Riyadh farm where they were being bred.

The empty syringes were found lying on the floor of the empty cages, and the big cats had vanished.

Owner Ibrahim Al Osaimi, 54, said the cats were worth more than £100,000 and were probably stolen to order.

He said: ‘They were very rare, especially the tiger. They were all trained to make them tame and perfect pets.’

Big cats are popular as pets among wealthy Arabs who pay vast sums for animals which are difficult to obtain.

Police declined to comment on the case saying only that the investigation was ongoing.
