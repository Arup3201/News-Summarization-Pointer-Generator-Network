A mother and daughter have pleaded guilty to bilking hundreds of lonely women around the world out of over $1million.

Karen Vasseur, 63, and daughter Tracy Vasseur, 42, pleaded guilty to posing as US soldiers in a Nigerian-style internet romance scam where they stole $1.1million from 374 victims in the States and 40 other countries, Colorado Attorney General John Suthers announced Wednesday. The greedy family matriarch is also alleged to have tried to steal an inheritance from her own children.

The elder Vasseur received a 15-year prison sentence for the scam, daughter Karen was given a 12-year sentence, Mr Suthers said.

‘Not only did this mother-daughter duo break the law, they broke hearts worldwide,’ said Mr Suthers, ‘it is fitting that they received stiff sentences for their unconscionable crimes committed in the name of love and the United States military.’

The despicable duo copped to seeking lonely women on dating websites and posing as military members looking for relationships, according to Mr Suthers.

Once the con artists gained the womens’ trust, they would claim they had inherited millions of dollars and would be able to provide unsecured loans for an origination fee, Mr Suthers said.

This ruse generated well over $1million dollars, of which the women kept about 10 per cent and funnelled the rest to Nigeria through a web of almost 20 different bank accounts across 11 banks, according to the Denver Post.

Karen Vasseur even convinced her minor daughter to send and receive wires containing the ill-gotten money, the Post said.

The two heartbreakers ‘never provided the loans, yet kept thousands of dollars in payments,’ said Mr Suthers.

Restitution will be determined at a later date, he added.

In an even weirder turn of events, Karen Vasseur even tried stealing an inheritance from her own children.

While free on bond during trial for the Nigerian dating scam, the greedy granny ‘related to trying to gain control over her children’s inheritance and for attempting to influence a public servant,’ according to Mr Suthers.

An additional four years was tacked on to her sentence, for a total of 19 years to be served consecutively.
