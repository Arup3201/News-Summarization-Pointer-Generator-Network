Louis van Gaal does not believe that Ashley Young dived to win a penalty during Manchester United's 1-1 draw against Sunderland - but admitted the winger made 'too much' of the tackle.

During the second half of the match, Young appeared to throw himself over Sunderland defender Wes Brown's out-stretched leg in the penalty area with the ball already past him.

Referee Martin Atkinson booked Young for simulation and waved away the United players’ appeals for a spot-kick.

Too much: Louis van Gaal thought it was a penalty but admits the winger made 'too much' of the tackle

Speaking to Sky Sports 1 after the game at the Stadium of Light, Van Gaal said: 'He (Young) was free at the ball.

'He lifted the ball across the player (Brown) and the opponent is kicking him.

'So after that he was jumping too much I think but what counts is that he was kicked by the opponent and then the referee can give a penalty.’

When asked again by Geoff Shreeves if Young dived, Van Gaal replied: 'No I don't think so. He was tackled in my opinion but after that he was exaggerating.

‘It is not diving because he was not touched by the opponent and I think that is always the reason and the rest is rubbish.'

The incident occurred with the game evenly poised at 1-1.

Juan Mata had opened the scoring against the run of play for the visitors in the first half when he tapped in an Antonio Valencia cross.

Jack Rodwell then equalised for the Black Cats on his home debut with a bullet header on the half-hour mark.

And Van Gaal rued the referee's decision not to award a penalty for the Young incident, or when Robin van Persie appeared to be fouled just moments before by Santiago Vergini.

The Dutchman continued: 'The same I think he (the referee) can also give the penalty to Van Persie.

'You can see that Van Persie was already losing the ball but the tackle was already coming and that is the reason why he has to give the penalty or not.

'There are referees who would give a penalty but nevertheless we have to create more chances than penalties.'

Van Gaal was also asked about the potential imminent arrival of Angel Di Maria from Real Madrid for a fee of £60million.

He refused to say United would sign the Argentina winger, but did admit he liked the player.

'Yeah (I do like Di Maria), but I like Messi also,' said Van Gaal. ‘There are an awful lot of players that I like but they cannot always come to Manchester United.'

'I think always the club has to announce it when they are ready and when we are thinking it is the right time for a transfer then we come to you and we say "we have bought that player or the other player".'
