The world's largest 'flawless' diamond ever to put up for auction could sell for more than $20million.

The pear-shaped diamond is one of only a handful in the world that to have been graded by experts to have both perfect colour and clarity.

And at 101.73 carats it is more than twice the size of a similar 'flawless' diamond which recently sold for $9.4million.

The world's largest 'flawless' diamond ever to go on sale took 21 months to polish

There are believed to be no more than 
600 flawless diamonds which are between one and two carats in existence,
and above ten carats even less.

For a diamond to meet every criteria of perfection and be more than 100 carats is exceptionally rare, says auction house Christie's.

The diamond was carved from a 236-carat 
rough diamond that was found at the Jwaneng Mine in Botswana and took 21
months to polish.

It will be auctioned by Christie's at May 15 as part of the Magnificent Jewels 
sale at the Four Seasons Hotel des Bergues in Geneva.

At 101.73 carats the diamond is the largest 'flawless' gem of its kind ever to go on sale

Estimates are available on request, but a pear-shaped D colour, internally flawless diamond of 50.52 carats recently sold for over $9.4 million at auction.

'A perfect diamond is the result of 
the skill and vision of a master cutter who is able to uncover beauty 
from a rough gem,' said Rahul Kadakia, head of Jewellery, Christie’s 
Switzerland and Americas.

'This diamond is in its scale, 
quality and rarity one of the most beautiful ‘white’ diamonds Christie’s
has ever had the honor of offering for sale.'

The successful buyer will also be given the privilege of naming the diamond.

The Gemological Institute of America graded it with the best color, D, and the best clarity. Fewer than 2 percent of the world’s diamond meets the type IIA criteria for transparency and brilliance.

The world’s most famous pear-shaped diamond is the Cullinan I, a colourless, Type IIA stone of 530.20 carats, which forms part of the British Crown Jewels. It is also the largest colourless diamond known.
