It’s rare to walk into a house and instantly yearn to live there. So it must have been a wrench for Pearl Lowe and Danny Goffey to decide to sell their enchanting Jacobean home.

The Old Rectory, on sale for £1.3 million, is just outside Wanstrow in Somerset, fortunately several miles from the flood-hit parts of the county. From each upstairs window is a magnificent view across to green rolling hills.

‘We have lived in Somerset for six years and in the Old Rectory for a year,’ says Pearl, 43. She and Danny,  39 – drummer with Supergrass and, more recently, Babyshambles – want to move somewhere smaller locally and invest in a property abroad.

Selling up: Pearl Lowe, 43, is putting her Somerset home. which she shares with husband Danny Goffey and three of her children, on the market for £1.3million

Once a singer in the bands Powder and Lodger, Pearl now has fashion and interiors ranges. She and Danny both work predominantly from home, commuting to London for meetings.

Three of their four children live with them – teenagers Frankie and Alfie, and eight-year-old Betty. Pearl’s daughter with singer Gavin Rossdale is 25-year-old model Daisy Lowe.

‘The great thing about Somerset is  that I can drop Betty at school, whizz up to town by train for meetings  and pick her up at the end of school,’ says Pearl.

‘I love the buzz of London, but a quieter family life in the country is wonderful.’

In the 1990s, Pearl and Danny were part of the Primrose Hill Set, the group of actors, musicians and models living in North London who became known for their party lifestyles. But just as members such as Noel Gallagher, Sienna Miller and Jonny Lee Miller now have a settled way of life, so have Pearl and Danny.

With six bedrooms and four bathrooms, there is plenty of space in The Old Rectory for a large family and guests, including Daisy.

Before moving in, Pearl spent six months refurbishing from top to bottom. She says: ‘Everything needed replacing – electricity, plumbing, the avocado 1970s bathrooms .  .  .’

Most of the walls are white, with clever touches of colour – in the  high-ceilinged drawing room the window frames are a delicate lilac, and the windows hung with Pearl’s own-design lace curtains.

The large kitchen has pastel woodwork and a pale blue Aga warms  the whole room. ‘We had to have  a pantry as Danny loves to cook,’  says Pearl.

Beyond the kitchen is a cosy snug where the family watch telly together on chilly evenings.

Walking up the wide stairs, you  are faced with a large, light landing with rows of bookcases on either side. ‘This is a great place to sit and read,’ says Pearl.

Her vintage style is evident upstairs. Betty’s bathroom has a pale-blue cast-iron bath, and  the sink is patterned with wild flowers.

The master bedroom leads  into probably the coolest (not literally) bathroom in the country. With silver-and-black-lace-patterned wallpaper, grey-black curtains and freestanding bath, it is stunningly opulent.

An enormous dressing room is lined with cupboards for Pearl’s clothes.

Outside the back door is an enchanting walled courtyard with picnic table and chairs. The rest of the three-acre garden is mostly lawn  and orchard, with a paddock. ‘Betty wants a pony, but we haven’t got round to it,’ says Pearl.

A little outhouse constitutes another spare room. This one boasts an  en suite bathroom and would be  ideal for a nanny.

To the left of the house is a refurbished barn with a mezzanine, kitchen and bathroom. And in the grounds there’s a traditional gipsy caravan which was renovated  by Pearl.

‘We’ll miss The Old Rectory,’ she says. ‘It’s been a haven from the madness of city life.’
