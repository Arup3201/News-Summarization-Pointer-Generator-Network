A husband who started an affair with his wife’s GP days after she died has claimed his Christian faith allowed him to ‘move on’.

Robert Owens, 66, asked Dr Judith Ames to marry him 19 days after Joyce, 69, lost her fight against lung cancer.

And although he admitted his relationship with the 52-year-old doctor had grown ‘very fast,’ he said: ‘I cared for my wife in her dying days.

‘Once she is dead, in my understanding, that’s it. I move on.’

Within a month the GP had moved into 
the marital home to be with Mr Owens and told colleagues she would quit 
her job if they disapproved.

The pair are now engaged and are due to marry in September.

Giving evidence to a hearing of the 
Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service, Mr Owens said soon after the 
death of his wife, of 34 years, he realised that he and Dr Ames shared 
the same ‘free spirit’.

He even claims their relationship will ‘be of benefit to the community’.

‘I have this mental attitude that I 
live for the present,’ he said. ‘I live with a very strong faith and 
relationship with God and I’m able to deal with things very quickly.’

Mr Owens said he met Dr Ames a 
fortnight after the death on March 8, so the GP could keep her promise 
to Mrs Owens to attend church with her husband after her death.

‘Over those three or four days there 
was a genuine love story that started on the Saturday, by the Tuesday I 
proposed to Dr Ames to be my wife, so it is in the context of that 
relationship growing very fast,’ he said. But friends and family were 
unhappy about the situation and Dr Ames was reported to the General 
Medical Council.

He said: ‘My daughter, who I converse with every week, said, “Gosh dad that’s very quick but as long as you’re happy”.

‘My son replied in the same vein. With friends it depended how close they were with my wife.

‘One of my close friends said: “I can 
see you are extremely happy but it’s like you are taking your Christmas 
present and opening it early.”’

Dr Ames was working at the Mannamead 
surgery in Plymouth when Mrs Owens – her husband’s second wife – went 
for a consultation in May 2011 complaining of dizziness and was later 
diagnosed with lung cancer. Over the following 10 months Dr Ames, a 
mother-of-three, made regular trips to the couple’s home.

She also visited them on the day Mrs Owens died.

Although Mr Owens was also registered at the practice, Dr Ames never treated him, the panel in Manchester were told.

Mr Owens, who has two children from his first marriage, said the care Dr Ames gave his second wife was ‘first-class’.

He added: ‘I was attracted to the 
qualities of compassion and care she had shown my wife. I discovered we 
had a similar spirit. A spirit which is free. I would consider the 
relationship a very close convergence of our characters and my proposal 
for marriage is for a life-long relationship.’

The couple claim their relationship 
was not sexual until after Mrs Owens passed away. However, the panel 
heard that two days before Mrs Owens’ death, Dr Ames revealed to a 
receptionist that she had developed a bond with Mr Owens and was off to 
the couple’s home for ‘gin and tonics’.

Mr Owens said it was not out of 
character for him to move so quickly from one partner to the next 
because had done the same with his second wife.

‘When my first wife left me, and I 
realised that marriage was broken up, my motivation then was to find a 
new partner,’ he added.

Dr Ames faces allegations that her 
actions were sexually motivated, an abuse of her professional position 
and contrary to the GMC’s guidelines.

She admits several allegations of 
misconduct but denies her fitness to practise was impaired. If found 
guilty she could be suspended or even struck off the medical register.

The hearing continues.
