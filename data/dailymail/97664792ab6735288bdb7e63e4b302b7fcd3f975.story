A New Jersey man has been found guilty of murder and other charges in the 2012 stabbing death of a 6-year-old boy who was trying to save his 12-year-old sister as the killer attacked her in her bed.

It took a Camden jury less than three hours to find 33-year-old Osvaldo Rivera guilty of the murder of Dominick Andujar, as well as charges of attempted murder, aggravated sexual assault, burglary and weapons violations.

About 12 a.m. on September 2, 2012, Rivera broke into Andujar's family's home and attacked his sister Amber as she slept on the couch.

Guilty: Osvaldo Rivera will likely be sentenced to life in prison in the murder of 6-year-old Dominick Andujar

Hero: 6-year-old Dominick fought with Rivera enough so that his sister could escape the attack

Amber began to scream, which awoke 6-year-old Dominick - and he rushed to his sister's aid.

The small boy fought with the attacker and managed to free his sister in the process.

Amber, who was bleeding after being slashed in the throat by Rivera, ran to a neighbor's home to call for help. She also says she was raped in the attack.

Rivera, however, murdered the boy - Dominick's throat was cut and he had injuries on his hands. He was found dead in the home by police.

Monster: Rivera also has charges pending that he molested a 2-year-old boy who also lived in his neighborhood

'He gave his life for his family,' his mother, Debbie Burgos, told Philly.com.Â 

Amber, Burgos told reporters, is 'doing great. She's a survivor.'

Rivera, who likely will spend the rest of his life in prison, also has charges pending for the alleged molestation of a 2-year-old boy in August of 2012.

He will be tried separately in that pending case.

Prosecutors say that Amber's testimony was instrumental in convicting Rivera, who used to give haircuts to the neighborhood kids.

Tragic: Rivera faces a likely sentence of life in prison for the murder of 6-year-old Dominick

'It's further evidence of what a survivor she is - at her 
age that she could walk into a courtroom full of people most of which 
were strangers and (recount) the most terrible things that could happen 
to a person, let alone a child,' prosecutor Christine Shah told reporters.

'She is an incredibly courageous girl," Shah continued. 'I think she did it for her brother.'

Shah says her office will 'aboslutely' ask the judge to sentence Rivera to life in prison.

His next court date is October 23.
