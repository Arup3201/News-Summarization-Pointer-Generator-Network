The unsolicited message send out by Optical Express offering surgeries as prizes

A High Street optician being sued over failed operations bombarded the public with spam text messages telling them they could win free eye surgery, it emerged last night.

Thousands of people complained about unsolicited messages from Optical Express dangling the prospect they had won a monthly prize draw for eye surgery worth more than £5,000.

Campaigners for better regulation of the eye surgery industry accused the firm of promoting a complicated medical procedure ‘like a free holiday’.

The firm has now been warned by the privacy watchdog, the Information Commissioner, not to send out more spam messages or it will face criminal prosecution. Optical Express said it would appeal the ruling.

The Glasgow-based company, which is the UK’s leading commercial eye surgery provider, is already facing legal action from dozens of patients amid safety fears over a type of replacement lens it uses. 

Yesterday the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) issued an enforcement notice against the firm requiring it to stop sending spam messages or be hauled before the courts.

Nearly 5,000 people complained about Optical Express in just seven months between September 2013 and April last year, saying they had received messages without giving the company permission.

The watchdog estimates it receives one complaint for every 1,000 spam texts sent – meaning the firm may have sent mil-lions of texts in total.

Typical messages, seen by the Mail, said: ‘OPTICAL EXPRESS: Are you the September Laser Eye Surgery winner? Reply YES to enter our free prize draw. Prize worth up to £5,390.’

Sasha Rodoy, 61, who has been campaigning for better regulation of the corrective surgery industry since her eyesight was damaged in an eye procedure by a different high street firm four years ago, said even she had recently received one of the Optical Express spam messages.

‘I have no idea how they got my number,’ the former fashion company owner said. ‘There’s no way I gave my number to them.

In the dark: High Street optician Optical Express is being sued over failed eye surgeries

‘Offering eye surgery as a prize as if it were a free holiday should simply be banned.

‘These are complicated medical procedures that should not be taken lightly.

‘People who would never usually consider having eye surgery are being tempted into it. And if you say no, they hassle you and hassle you and do not let go.’

Andy Curry, Enforcement Group Manager at the ICO said: ‘Thousands of people who had not signed up for marketing services received these nuisance messages.

‘We have issued this enforcement notice as a warning to the company that using people’s data without their consent is not acceptable. Any breach of the notice would be a criminal of-fence.’

Patients, surgeons and politicians have been calling for far greater regulation of corrective eye surgery sold on the high street.

They say heavy marketing, sales targets and lax regulation have created an environment in which people are often sold unsuitable medical procedures.

Charlie Jackson, 46, who is suing Optical Express over claims of a botched operation, accused the firm of pushing procedures on patients in order to drive up sales.

Mr Jackson, who runs a recruitment consultancy in Henley-on-Thames, said a corrective operation in August had given him fuzzy vision and terrible eyesight at night.

‘The major issue is the way they sell these operations,’ he told the Mail.

‘Heavy marketing and spam messages are all part of it - medical procedures should not be sold in this way.

‘Sales and healthcare do not go together. And offering laser eye surgery as a prize in a competition is just ridiculous. It is not right.’

The Medical Health Regulatory Authority is investigating concerns over the Mplus X lens which was used by Optical Express on an estimated 6,500 British patients over the last year.

Leading eye surgeons at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London raised concerns over the lens, which is used in a procedure called refractive lens exchange, usually to fix minor eyesight problems.

The artificial lens is designed to correct weakness of vision after it is implanted into the eye.

More than 100 patients have also joined a class action law suit against Optical Express, claiming their eyesight rapidly deteriorated after receiving implants. Both firms deny there are any problems with the lens.

A spokesman from Optical Express said: ‘We are aware of the decision taken by the ICO. We will be lodging an appeal.’
