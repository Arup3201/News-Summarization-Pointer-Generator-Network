Prince Philip was legally a knight for more than a fortnight before Tony Abbott revealed his captain's call to the country on Australia Day.

The prime minister's office first sought advice about giving the Queen's husband a knighthood in November 2014, Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet officials confirmed on Monday.

They also revealed the Letters Patent for the Order of Australia had to be amended because the Duke of Edinburgh was not an Australian citizen, making him an 'honorary' knight only.

It was also necessary to place Prince Philip ahead of Prince Charles in the order of precedence.

Mr Abbott sent a cover letter to the Queen with the amended Letters Patent in mid-December.

The Queen agreed to the recommendation to knight her husband on January 7, 2015.

Cabinet minister Eric Abetz told a Senate estimates hearing on Monday that he only found out about the knighthood when it was announced publicly on January 26.

According to the ABC, Mr Abbott said In a speech at the National Press Club this month that he accepted the decision was a 'captain's call', and he 'probably overdid it on awards'.

'I just want to make it clear that all awards in the Order of Australia will henceforth be entirely a matter for the Order of Australia Council,' he said.

Mr Abbott, when asked by Labor during question time why he didn't tell his senior colleagues in November of the knighthood, said Order of Australia honours did not go to cabinet.

it has been revealed that Tony Abbot knew he was going to award Prince Philip with the knighthood two weeks before the news was released 

'Simple as that,' he said.

The Order of Australia Council, and not the prime minister of the day, will now have sole responsibility for creating knights and dames.

When the announcement broke on Australia Day, Prime Minister Tony Abbott defended his decision to honour the Duke of Edinburgh with a knighthood, despite widespread backlash from Cabinet colleagues.

Mr Abbott faced a storm of criticism and was accused of creating a 'time warp' by awarding a member of Britain's royal family the country's highest honour.

Cabinet members said the Prime Minister did not consult with any of them before making his decision, with one senior politician claiming he thought it was an April's Fool's Day joke. 

But some of the country's senior politicians, along with many Twitter users, aired their opposition to the announcement..

The government head of the Northern Territory, Adam Giles, said he did not think the news was serious on first reading.

'I woke up this morning and read the wires and I thought it was April Fool's Day,' he said.

'I think it takes away from the legitimacy of the knighthood role. I think it makes a bit of a joke in a range of areas.'

Speaking to the ABC, Mr Giles made it clear that he was opposed to the knighthood.

'It's Australia Day,' he said. 'We're not a bunch of tossers, let's get it right.' he said.
