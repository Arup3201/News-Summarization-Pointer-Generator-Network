A group of people traveling in Canada have captured a video they described as 'the sight of a lifetime'.

Inside a taxi journeying from Fort Providence to Yellowknife in northwest Canada, the group happened to stumble across a herd of bison.

However as the car got closer, they realized at least three wolves were trying to take down the herd.

Fortunately for the buffalo, the wolves were scared off by the cab, and scattered into the nearby woods.

Scroll down for video 

Rescued: As the cab approaches the herd under attack, three wolves can be seen scattering for the woods

Rare sight: The whole scene was captured on video using a cell phone 

Great timing: The cab, going from Fort Providence to Yellowknife in icy conditions, just happened to stop the attack by being in the right place at the right time

'Those buffalo got saved by us, eh?' one woman can be heard saying in the video.

'That was amazing. I don't know when we'll ever see that again.' 

The video was posted to Facebook by user Kerry Mercer, believed to be the person filming.

The person then thanks the driver for slowing down.

'No problem,' he says. 

'It's good to see.'

Safe: The herd were able to continue with their journey once the wolves fled

Heading for the hills: As a truck approaches, the herd move off into the woods

Adding to the footage is the fact that sunlight breaks right after the herd is rescued.

The light quickly switches from blue to an orange hue. 

It's not uncommon for people to take a taxi between Yellowknife and Fort Providence — a distance of about 315 kilometers.

However one local company, Yellowknife's City Cabs, quotes $650 for the trip.
