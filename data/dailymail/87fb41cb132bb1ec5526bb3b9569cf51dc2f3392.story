The best friend of a boy sentenced to life in prison for killing his own parents with a hammer and then throwing a party as their brutalized bodies lay in the bathroom, said that his life is ruined because of his friends murderous actions.

Micheal Mandell, the best friend of murderer Tyler Hadley spoke with ABC News about seeing the bloodied bodies of his friends parents Blake and Mary Jo Hadley and of his friend's heinous actions on July 16, 2011 in Port St. Lucie, Fla.

'It ruined my life. It ruined Tyler's life. It ended his parents' life,' Mandell, 20, told ABC News’ “20/20."

Michael Mandell says that his best friend Tyler Hadley's murderous actions ruined his life

Mandell grew up one block away from Tyler Hadley and they became instant friends.

'I was just walking around, looking for friends, and I met Tyler … He slowly became my best friend, Mandell said.

Tyler Hadley's aunt Cindy hadley also spoke with ABC and said that by the time Tyler had turned 15, they started seeing a change in him.

'He started skipping school, hanging out with the wrong crowd, getting on drugs,' Tyler Hadley’s aunt, Cindy Hadley, told “20/20.” 'We knew marijuana.'

When Tyler Hadley turned 17, his parents did everything they could try try to help him including getting him a psychiatrist, antidepressants, and a substance abuse program.

One week before the party, Mandell says Tyler came home drunk so his parents took away his cell phone as a punishment.

'He felt that, I guess, that was too much, and that she was over disciplining him. And he said he wanted to kill her,' Mandell said.

Mandell said even though his friend said he'd kill his parents he didn't actually believe he would do it.

'It sounded like he was mad he was getting punished,' he said.

During the party Mandell said his friend made a confession that at first he didn't believe was true.

'He says, "Mike, I killed my parents." And I said, "No you didn't, Tyler. Shut up. What are you talking about?"' Mandell said.

'And, he said, "Mike ... look at the driveway, all the cars are there. My parents aren’t in Orlando. I killed my parents."'

Mandell saw blood by the door of the parents' master bedroom and on the computer desk but he thought his friend was playing a prank on him.

'I took Tyler into the garage, and I said, "What's going on here? I want to see them dead, if you really did it. I don't believe you,"' Mandell said.

Hadley wanted to wait until the party died down to show his friend the proof but Mandell refused to wait.

'I come up to the [master bedroom] door. The party's going on over here, and I turn the door knob,' Mandell said.

'I looked down, and I [saw] his father's leg against the door … My eyes popped up, and I said, "Oh my, he's telling the truth. He did it. This is real."'

Mandell told reporters that he stayed at the party for a few more hours after his friend told him that he killed his parents in order to support his troubled friend.

'If you were in my shoes, and that guy was your best friend, you wouldn't want [to] leave right away,' Mandell said. 'I know how heinous and sick this is, you know, what he did. But, you ... wouldn't have ran away, because you're comfortable with this guy. You don't see him as a killer.'

Sentenced: Tyler Hadley, who murdered his parents, walks from the courtroom after being sentenced to life in prison without parole at the St. Lucie County Courthouse in Florida on Thursday March 20

Mandell took a selfie with Hadley,
 which received a lot of criticism from people saying he didn't take the crime seriously, but he said he took the photo because he knew it was 
the last time he'd ever see his friend.

'I knew it was going to 
be the last time I ever [saw] him,' said Mandell who left the party 
hours later and called Crime Stoppers to report his friend's murder.

'You
 know, I didn't have any hesitation whatsoever for calling the cops,' 
Mandell said. 'The … worst feeling had to have been realizing ...that 
his parents are gone.'

Hadley, who was just 17 when he brutally 
beat his parents to death before throwing a party with their bodies 
still inside the house has been sentenced to life without parole on March 20, 2014.

Tyler Hadley beat his
 parents, Mary Jo and Blake Hadley, to death with a hammer at their St 
Lucie, Florida home in 2011, then spent three hours clearing up their 
blood so he could have a party.

In
 February, Hadley pleaded no contest in February to two counts of 
first-degree murder and on Friday Judge Robert R. Makemson handed Hadley
 two life sentences.

He branded the crime brutal, heinous and premeditated.

Hadley's attorney had argued for two 30-year sentences, to be served concurrently, with a review after 20 years. Hadley couldn't receive a death sentence because he was 17 at the time of the killings.

A fellow inmate has said Hadley signs autographs and refers to himself as 'hammer boy' behind bars.

After the shocking crime, a friend of Hadely's, Markey Philips, recounted that two weeks before the horrific murders, the teen had seemed withdrawn when they hung out at his home.

Stress: Ryan Hadley, who'd previously called his brother a 'pathological liar', listens to the verdict

Emotional: Family members exit the court after Hadley was given two life sentences

Hadley, who had been in trouble with the law in the past for arson and was a known drug taker and underage drinker, told mandell that he 'wanted to kill his parents and have a big party after' - because nobody had ever done that before. As Mandell told, ABC, he didn't take Hadley seriously.

On the morning of the killings, Hadley was asked by a friend if the party he had been bragging about all week was still on and if he was going to kill his parents, to which he reponded: 'no but im gonna.'

He took three ecstasy pills and used a claw hammer to murder his parents, authorities said.

That night, about 60 people gathered for a party at the family's Fort Pierce home, playing beer pong, smoking cigars and drinking while the victims' bodies were locked in their bedroom.

Friends described Hadley as being in a
 good mood and hospitable during the party. One friend said Hadley had 
planned to hold a second bash the following night.

Victims: Mary Jo and Blake Hadley were beaten to death and locked in their room as their son partied

Plan: Hadley locked his parents' bodies in their bedroom then threw a party for 60 people downstairs

Word of the killings eventually made its way around the party, police said.

Mandell's call to police lead to Hadley's arrest early the next morning.

Hadley told a friend interviewed by police that his father had punched him in the face several times, according to investigative files previously released by prosecutors.

But a fellow inmate said Hadley told him 
he'd never been beaten or molested, the files stated, and the man's 
brother, Ryan Hadley, called his parents 'awesome' and said his brother 
was a 'pathological liar.'

Stains: Hadley told an inmate that he knew his parents loved him because they didn't try to stop him

Evidence seized from the home hinted at some mental problems for the defendant, including a receipt for a mental health center and a bottle of an antidepressant medication, authorities said.

An inmate, Justin Toney, said that Hadley was famous throughout the prison and had signed autographs.

He said Hadley knew he had 'shocked the world' and realised something about his parents as he allegedly attacked them with a hammer.

'I said, "Did they try to stop you?"' Toney asked about the attack. 'And he was like, "No, that's how I knew that they really loved me."'
