They may be more used to brandishing a bat than swinging a club, but cricket legends were out in force for the celebrity Pro-Am event at the BMW New Zealand Open.

Stars from the crease were drafted in to play the tournament in Queenstown since it coincides with the 2015 Cricket World Cup, with organisers admitting they chose 'to go with it rather than try to compete against it'.

Former Australian spinner Shane Warne posted an Instagram picture from the event that resembled a Who's Who of cricketing greats from all over the world, including Ricky Ponting, Sir Viv Richards, Brian Lara, Nathan Astle, Mark Richardson and Graeme Swann.

Ponting, who played at Milbrook last year along with returning England legend Ian Botham, has employed his father as caddie to keep him from losing his cool out on the course.

'I'll just give the club to him as quick as I can so he puts it back in the bag and it doesn't end up disappearing into the lake or anything,' he told Stuff NZ. 

Despite being a scratch golfer, the former Australia captain has tipped Warne, who plays under an 11 handicap, as a contender to win.

'Warnie will be up there in the end ... I hope he's not,' he said.
