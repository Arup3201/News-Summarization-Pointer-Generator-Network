Russian police are investigating the mysterious death of a man shot dead by a lethal 007-style gun disguised as a pen.

Alexei Tolmachev, 35, from Tambov, was found slumped on the floor at his friend's office in Moscow, killed by a shot to his right temple. 

Beside him was the pen - in fact a deadly weapon.  

'On the floor was found a man, all in blood,' said a police report.

'His head was destroyed by the bullet.'

Initial reports suggest the man - alone in the offices of a housing services company - shot himself, though it was unclear if the weapon, the kind that the KGB might have used in the Cold War, was his own or something he found by chance.  

His friend, Igor Trofimov, said he had allowed unemployed TV cameraman Tolmachev into his office during a night shift so he could use his computer to search for work. 

'We spent together a few hours together  chatting and surfing the Internet,' said the friend.  

'Alexei didn't complain about anything, he behaved normally.

At 2am I told him I was tired and went to have some rest. 

'He said that he would stay a bit longer by the computer, he wanted to check his social network page.'

The pen found next to Tolmachev has been likened to that used by James Bond in the film Goldeneye

The man gave no clue that he was distressed or liable to kill himself, said Trofimov.

A police statement said: 'According to preliminary data from the investigation, the man shot himself in the head from an improvised firing device - made from a pen.  

'The circumstances and cause of the incident are to be established.'
