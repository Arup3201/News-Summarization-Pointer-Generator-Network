Norwegian wonderkid Martin Odegaard is believed to have the option of signing a five-year deal with Real Madrid when he turns 16.

The 15-year-old, likened to Barcelona's Lionel Messi, has his birthday on December 17 and is being tracked by Europe's elite clubs, including Bayern Munich, Manchester United and Liverpool.

But Spanish newspaper Marca report the Norway international can join Real after representatives from the club offered Odegaard the move once he turns 16.

Odegaard is a fan of Liverpool and has been due to have a trial with the club before Christmas. He underwent a similar trial with Real and previously had offers from Ajax and United.

Last month the Stromsgodset forward branded Bayern Munich the 'best club in the world' in a documentary made about the youngster.

Odegaard has been encouraged to sign a professional contract when eligible, and could do so if he wishes to opt for Real come December. He would then have the option of continuing his development in Norway or joining a different La Liga club on loan.
