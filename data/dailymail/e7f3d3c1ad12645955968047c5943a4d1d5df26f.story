Steve Borthwick will hang up his boots on Saturday satisfied he has earned the respect of his team-mates during a 16-year career which has not always seen him embraced by the English public.

Borthwick is the most capped player in Aviva Premiership history with 264 appearances. And he has played through the pain of a serious pectoral injury, sustained almost two months ago, to attempt to finish his career with a domestic final victory against Northampton at Twickenham. 

The former England captain, who represented his country 57 times and was first-choice skipper during much of Martin Johnson’s troubled reign, has never sought public adulation.

Adulation: Steve Borthwick retires with the respect of his team-mates and loved ones, which is 'all that matters'

Esteemed: The former England captain, Borthwick retires with the record for Premiership appearances

‘I believe I have earned the respect of my team-mates and they know how much I want to play well for them,’ said the 34-year-old.

‘They are the people that matter to me; my family and my team-mates. As long as they think well of me, that’s all that matters.

‘Other people can think what they like to be honest.

‘I feel content with where I am. I’ve been a professional for 16 years, I have played for two great clubs in Bath and Saracens.

‘I think I have earned the respect of my team-mates and made lots of great friends.

‘I will look back content with it. It has been a fantastic journey as a player and hopefully there will be plenty more steps to go involved in this brilliant sport.’

Borthwick’s next move will be to link up with his former Saracens boss Eddie Jones as Japan forwards coach ahead of next year’s World Cup in England.

Before then, the Saracens captain must pick his players up for the Aviva Premiership final after last weekend’s crushing  23-6 Heineken Cup final defeat to Toulon in Cardiff.

‘I don’t know if I’ll be emotional,’ he said.

‘Hopefully the result goes our way, but we need to make sure our work rate, effort and intensity is at the standard that is acceptable, and we put in a performance we are proud of.’
