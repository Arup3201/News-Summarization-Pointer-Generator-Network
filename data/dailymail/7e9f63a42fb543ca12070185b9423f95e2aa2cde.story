A Canton, Michigan man was left teary-eyed after a recent fight with his wife - but not because he was sad.

Wife Kristy Ryan McDermed swapped the saline in his Visine bottle for bleach.

After the incident in mid-October, her husband went to police and now the 35-year-old faces a jail sentence and possible fine for spiking the solution.

'He felt a burning sensation and could smell what appeared to be bleach,' Detective Sgt Chad Baugh told KSDK.

At the time, Mrs McDermed told police she poisoned the solution to get back at her husband after a fight.

She plead guilty to misdemeanor charges of domestic violence earlier this month.

'I've never seen a case like this in my 18 years. It's incredible that this person came out of this with very minor injuries,' Sgt Baught told WXYZ.

While the bleach may have hurt, Sgt Baugh says the incident didn't result in any permanent damage to Mr McDermed's eyes.

Sentencing in the case will be handed out on January 13, and Mrs McDermed could face up to 93 days in jail and a $500 fine.

Detective Baugh also alleged that Mrs McDermed placed an ad on Craigslist, offering to pay someone to assault her husband.

Authorities plan to investigate claims that Mrs McDermed was the victim of domestic abuse herself.
