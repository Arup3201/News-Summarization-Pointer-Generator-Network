Some three-year-olds have spent so long in front of the TV and strapped into pushchairs that they appear to be unable to walk, the Government’s top expert on troubled families has warned.

Louise Casey, 47, told a meeting in Westminster last week that a headteacher had informed her one child had spent so much time alone left in front of the screen that they could not even chew.

Prime Minister David Cameron’s adviser admitted at the meeting on child protection and Sure Start children’s centres that successive governments have tried and failed to cope with problem families.

Miss Casey said the problem of young children being unable to walk is a clear sign of the height of the challenge to help England’s 120,000 most troubled families, reported The Sunday Times.

The University of London history graduate, who was born in Redruth, Cornwall, said of governmental efforts to help: ‘Will any of these things touch those families? The answer is they haven’t done yet.’

National Association of Head Teachers general secretary Russell Hobby said: ‘It’s an extreme case, but more frequently we hear of children who can’t speak when they come to school.’

He told the Sunday Times those children can ‘only grunt’ and some also still wear nappies at the age of five. Mr Hobby said that issue and not being able to speak are ‘two most common complaints’.

Miss Casey's comments echoed the thoughts of Jackanory and Play School creator Joy Whitby, who warned last week that parents should avoid leaving young children unsupervised in front of the TV.

‘If I had a child under five at home again, I wouldn’t want to leave him in front of the television set unsupervised if I could possibly help it,’ the 82-year-old producer told the Daily Telegraph.

Last year Miss Casey released a study that revealed a shocking culture of criminality at the heart of Britain’s most feckless families who think nothing of having children they cannot afford.

The hard-hitting report revealed that those responsible for antisocial behaviour feature a high incidence of incest and sexual abuse, physical violence and a spiral of alcohol abuse and crime.
