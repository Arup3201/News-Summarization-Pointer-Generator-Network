The 400 residents of a high rise apartment that burst into flames in the early hours spent the rest of the night in a train station before being moved on to Etihad Stadium in Melbourne.

The residents had to be evacuated from the 20-storey building at Docklands in Melbourne at about 2.30am on Tuesday after a fire in one of the apartments.

Worried tenants were given yellow blankets by Ambulance Victoria and escorted to Southern Cross train station before a relief centre was set up at Etihad Stadium later in the morning.

'Big evacuation effort @EtihadStadiumAU following fire at adjacent apartment block. Evacuees are resting comfortably,' the stadium tweeted. 

The 400 stranded residents have all been accounted for and Victoria Police have said they will be able to go back to their homes this evening or tomorrow morning, Nine News reports.

The cause of the fire is not yet known but the Metropolitan Fire Brigade says it could be linked to a barbecue or air conditioning unit. 

Major traffic delays are expected and parts of La Trobe Street and Wurrundjeri Way are expected to be closed for most of the day, police say.

The MFB says the fire started on a second floor balcony and extended up the external face to the 20th floor.

400 yellow blankets were handed out to the residents by Victoria Ambulance

Ambulance Victoria paramedic Steve Moody said paramedics treated some evacuees for minor injuries.

'A couple of people suffered scraped knees from slipping on the building's stair coming down in the wet,' he said.

'We moved the evacuees to the bus terminal at Southern Cross Station so they were indoors and out of the cold.'
