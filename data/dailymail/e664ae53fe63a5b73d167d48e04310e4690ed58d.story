One in seven Britons works from home, official figures revealed yesterday.

The first analysis of ‘home workers’ reveals how the number has surged over the past 16 years, jumping by nearly 45 per cent.

It found that there are now more than four million people who work from home.

The study by the Office for National Statistics said the proportion had increased significantly since 1998, when only one in ten people did so – and the number is expected to rise even further when new rules come in this month.

Technological advances have driven the rise, allowing employees to keep in touch by email and web entrepreneurs to start businesses from their home computers.

But experts said the trend was also being fuelled by a rise in the number of over-65s who need to carry on working but do not want to have to commute.

To classify as a home worker, you must ‘usually spend at least half of your work time using your home’. For example, a full-time worker who does one day a week from home would be excluded.

And the number is certain to rise further after new rules come into force making it easier for people to work from home.

From June 30, all workers will be able to request the right to work flexibly, which could mean anything from a three-day week to only working during school term time – as well as working from home.

At present, the right to work flexibly is restricted to carers and parents. But under the new rules any employee who has been with a company for just six months will be able to ask to work flexibly, with their boss legally bound to agree unless there is ‘a good business reason’.

Many home workers are in rural areas, a sign that they opted for it as a lifestyle choice. West Somerset is the home working capital of the UK, where one in four people who have a job work at home.

Of the 4.2million home workers, around half are people between the ages of 25 and 49, many being parents with young children.

It is also extremely common among the over-65s. Of the people in this age group who have a job, almost four in ten work from home.

John Philpott, director of consultants The Jobs Economist, said Britain’s ageing population was fuelling the trend, with more older people needing to work but preferring to do it from home. ‘More older people are seeking to avoid the daily commute and the stresses of office life,’ he said.
