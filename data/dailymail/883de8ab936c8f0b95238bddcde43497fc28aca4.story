Australia's new tennis hero Nick Kyrgios was spotted on Monday driving around his hometown of Canberra in a flashy new silver Mercedes after his Wimbledon dream came to an end last week.

The 19-year-old, who arrived back home on Sunday, has shown the same love for luxury cars as Bernard Tomic whose bright orange BMW often led him into trouble.

'Good start to the day, picked up a car on loan whilst I'm home, so pumped with it. Thanks @RobertSmithIX and @JohnMorris1982 #BigGrin,' Kyrgios wrote of his new toy on his Twitter page.

But unlike Tomic, whose hard partying is well illustrated, Kyrgios has admitted he's planning to take it easy before unleashing his skill at his next event, the Toronto ATP 1000 in August.

The teenager has been enjoying some down time with a few friends at home after he stunned world by beating number one Rafael Nadal to reach the quarter finals of Wimbledon.

'It was great to come home to my Mum and brother Christos, the reception at Canberra Airport was so special and to see so many people come out to greet me was more than I could have asked for, it was very humbling actually and I felt a little embarrassed that they were there for me,' Kyrgios wrote in his blog on Saturday.

'I've managed to catch up with my mates and hang out with the boys, shoot some hoops and eat copious amounts of Sushi and Chinese foods since I've been home,' the tennis player said

'I've managed to catch up with my mates and hang out with the boys, shoot some hoops and eat copious amounts of Sushi and Chinese foods since I've been home although from today I will eat cleaner as I have one eye on next week and heading down to Melbourne for a few days with Todd to start my training block.'

'People keep talking about how my life will change forever and although I feel exactly the same and believe me, my mates and my family will not allow me to change but I have noticed a change in the way people are now towards me.

'I notice a lot more people stare and point, others come and say well done and what not which I prefer, but it's all positive.'

Kyrgios also reflected on his loss to eight seed Milos Raonic, who knocked him out of the competition, to the devastation of Australians everywhere.

Australian tennis star has built up a strong following on Twitter already.

The teenager stunned the world earlier in the competition when he beat number one player Rafael Nadal

'In the quarters as you could probably see, I was cooked and really needed that day off in between but I guess that is the nature of the beast playing on grass at Wimbledon, the schedule is something that can change more than at any other slam and you have to take the rough with the smooth,' he said.

'I'll go away and work harder to make sure I am better equipped for that next time.'

The tennis star will spend the next few weeks training in Melbourne and Canberra for the US Open.
