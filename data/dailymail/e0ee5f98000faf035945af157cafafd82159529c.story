The Chancellor will plough billions of pounds into building projects – including the extension of the controversial High Speed 2 line to the north of England.

George Osborne hopes that spending money on new buildings and transport projects will help the stumbling economy get going.

He used his Autumn Statement to unveil £5billion plans to improve key sections of the A1 and the M25, and extend the London Underground.

High speed trains will connect London to to Manchester and Leeds, via Birmingham, in what ministers hope will bring an economic boost for the north

The government pledged billions of pounds for rail and road schemes across the country which it claimed will kickstart local economies

And another 120,000 new homes will be built in a bid to tackle the chronic shortage of housing.

However, this will prove controversial as some may have to be built on green belt land.

Science will also benefit – with an extra £600million for new research facilities.

The Chancellor said: ‘Taken together, this is a revolution in the sources of finances for upgrading Britain’s infrastructure and equipping Britain to win the global race.

‘Annual average infrastructure investment, which was £29billion under the last Labour government, is now £33billion.’

He said that swingeing cuts in Whitehall departments will be diverted to capital projects.

‘All
the money saved in the first two years will be re-invested as part of a
£5billion capital investment in the infrastructure of our country,’ he 
said.

‘So despite the 
fiscal challenges we face, public investment as a share of GDP will be 
higher on average in this Parliament than it was under the last Labour 
government.

Key stretches of the M25 (left) will be upgraded while single lane stretches of the A30 in Cornwall (right) will become a dual-carriageway to ease jams on the main road used by holidaymakers

‘It’s exactly what equipping Britain to compete in the modern global economy should be doing.’

Mr Osborne announced an extra billion pounds into roads, including four major schemes. These are upgrades to key sections of the A1, bringing the route from London to Newcastle up to motorway standard.

In further efforts to get the country moving, the government announced a second wave of 'super-connected' cities to be given super-fast broadband.

The 12 smaller cities announced today are in addition to the ten larger cities that are sharing £114million.

The second wave will share £50 million with plans to offer speeds of up to 100Mbps (megabits per second) to homes and businesses.

The winning cities in the second wave are:  Brighton and Hove, Cambridge, Coventry, Derby, Oxford, Portsmouth, Salford, and York in England; Aberdeen and Perth in Scotland; Newport in Wales; and Derry/Londonderry in Northern Ireland.

The A5 will be linked to the M1, and 
the A30 in Cornwall will be turned into a dual carriageway. And the M25 
will be upgraded to support the biggest port developments in Europe.

RAC technical director David Bizley said: 'It is good news an extra £1bn is to be spent on roads, including four major new schemes to upgrade key sections of the A1, bringing the route from London to Newcastle up to motorway standard, link the A5 with the M1, dual the A30 in Cornwall and upgrade the M25.

'These important improvements will make a real difference to the lives of thousands of motorists every day.'

The
multi-billion-pound HS2 rail line, which is already confirmed from 
London to Birmingham, is hugely controversial because it will plough up 
miles of beautiful countryside.

Opponents say it is not worth the huge cost because it will not shave enough time off the journey time between the two cities.

Now it is to be extended to the north in two branches – one to Manchester and another to Leeds.

The Chancellor added: ‘We’ve already set out plans this autumn for a huge investment 
in rail, and my right honourable friend the Transport Secretary [Patrick
McLoughlin] will set out in the new year plans to take High Speed 2 to 
the north west and West Yorkshire.’

Mr Osborne also confirmed a 
billion-pound loan and a guarantee to extend London’s Northern Line to 
Battersea Power Station and support a new development on the site which 
will be a ‘similar scale to the Olympic Park’.

‘We’re confirming funding and reforms to assist construction of up to 120,000 new homes and delivering on flood defence schemes in more cities,’ he said.

And he announced funding for broadband expansion in 12 smaller cities – Brighton and Hove, Cambridge, Coventry, Derby, Oxford, Portsmouth, Salford, York, Newport, Aberdeen, Perth and Londonderry.

Mr Osborne pledged £600million more for the UK’s scientific research infrastructure.

And he said he would guarantee for up to £40billion more private-sector capital spending on infrastructure – so that the public sector shares the risk.
