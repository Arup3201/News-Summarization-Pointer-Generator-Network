A young British man has died after falling from the
third floor of a hotel on the island of Majorca.

Adam Atkinson, from Castleford in Yorkshire, who is believed to
have turned 20 just last week, plunged from Hotel Martinique in the popular
resort of Magaluf.

The incident happened at around 3am this morning when the Castleford High
School student was climbing a stairwell in the popular hotel on the
southern coast of the island.

Death fall: Adam Atkinson, from Castleford in Yorkshire is believed to have turned 20 just last week when he plunged from Hotel Martinique (pictured) in the popular resort of Magaluf

He was taken to the San Espases hospital in nearby
Palma, the island capital but he died in the hospital's intensive care unit
three hours later.

Tributes have poured in for Mr Atkinson who is believed to
have celebrated his 20th birthday last Wednesday.

On the following
day he wrote on his Facebook page: ‘I'm never drinking again.......until Monday
when we're en-route to Magaluf.’

Friend Becky Leonard wrote on her Facebook page: ‘RIP Adam
Atkinson. Love you and you're always gonna be in our hearts.’

Beth Wilford commented on Facebook: ‘He was one of the
funniest people I've ever met, It's true that they really do take the best.
Thinking of his family and friends at such an awful time.’

Escape: Mr Atkinson was enjoying a holiday at the resort of Magaluf on the Spanish island of Majorca when the tragedy happened

Mr Atkinson is the second young Briton to fall from a height
at a Spanish hotel this year.

Luke Parry, a 21-year-old Oxford University student,
suffered severe injuries when he plummeted from a second floor balcony at
Lloret de Mar, on the Costa Brava, early this month.

Mr Parry remains in hospital.

Last year more than a dozen Britons fell from hotels in
Spain - most of them in the Mediterranean holiday islands - and at least three
were killed.

Young people from Scandinavia, Italy and elsewhere also
died.
