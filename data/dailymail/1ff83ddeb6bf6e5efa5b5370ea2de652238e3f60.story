U.S. Secretary of 
State John Kerry on Sunday called climate change perhaps the world's 'most fearsome' destructive weapon and mocked those who deny its 
existence or question its causes, comparing them to people who insist 
the Earth is flat.

In a speech to Indonesian 
students, civic leaders and government officials, Kerry tore into 
climate change skeptics. He accused them of using shoddy science and 
scientists to delay steps needed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases
 at the risk of imperiling the planet.

A day 
earlier, the U.S. and China announced an agreement to cooperate more 
closely on combating climate change. American officials hope that will 
help encourage others, including developing countries like Indonesia and
 India, to follow suit.

WMD: John Kerry told a group of students that climate change is the most dangerous weapon of mass destruction the world faces

China and the United 
States are the biggest sources of emissions of carbon dioxide and other 
gases that cause the atmosphere to trap solar heat and alter the 
climate. Scientists say such changes are leading to drought, wildfires, 
rising sea levels, melting polar ice, plant and animal extinctions and 
other extreme conditions.

Also in the Jakarta speech, Kerry said everyone and every country must take responsibility for the problem and act immediately.

'We
 simply don't have time to let a few loud interest groups hijack the 
climate conversation,' he said, referring to what he called 'big 
companies' that 'don't want to change and spend a lot of money' to act 
to reduce the risks.

Kerry later singled out major oil and coal concerns as the primary offenders.

'We
 should not allow a tiny minority of shoddy scientists and science and 
extreme ideologues to compete with scientific facts,' Kerry told the 
audience at a U.S. Embassy-run American Center in a shopping mall.

'Nor should we allow any room for those who think that the costs associated with doing the right thing outweigh the benefits.'

Flat Earth: Kerry dismisses those who don't believe in climate change as members of 'the Flat Earth Society'

'The
 science is unequivocal, and those who refuse to believe it are simply 
burying their heads in the sand,' Kerry said. 'We don't have time for a 
meeting anywhere of the Flat Earth Society,'

Kerry
 said the cost of inaction will far outweigh the significant expense of 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions that trap solar heat in the atmosphere
 and contribute to the Earth's rising temperatures.

He
 outlined a litany of recent weather disasters, particularly flooding 
and typhoons in Asia, and their impact on commerce, agriculture, fishing
 and daily living conditions for billions of people.

'This
 city, this country, this region, is really on the front lines of 
climate change,' Kerry said. 'It's not an exaggeration to say that your 
entire way of life here is at risk.'

He added: 'In a sense, climate change can now be considered the world's largest 
weapon of mass destruction, perhaps even, the world's most fearsome 
weapon of mass destruction.'

The solution, 
Kerry said, is a new global energy policy that shifts reliance from 
fossil fuels to cleaner technologies. He noted the President Barack 
Obama is championing such a shift and encouraged others to appeal to 
their leaders to join.

Front lines: Kerry said places like Jakarta were the 'front lines' of the effects of climate change

The U.S.-China 
statement issued just after Kerry left Beijing on Saturday said the two 
countries agreed on steps to carry out commitments to curb greenhouse 
gases, including reducing vehicle emissions, improving energy efficiency
 of buildings and other measures.

Beijing and 
Washington launched a climate change discussion last year, promising 
progress in five areas: reducing vehicle emissions; advanced electric 
power grids; capturing and storing carbon emissions; gathering 
greenhouse gas data; and building efficiency.

Kerry
 was in Indonesia on the last leg of a three-nation tour of Asia that 
started in South Korea. After leaving Indonesia on Monday, he planned to
 visit Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.

Before
 the climate change speech, Kerry toured Jakarta's Istiqlal Mosque, one 
of the largest in the world, to pay his respects to Indonesia's Muslim 
majority population.
