Harry Redknapp believes England could win Euro 2016 and insists 'we might as well all give up' if tournament victory eludes the Three Lions next year.

Roy Hodgson's side could not progress beyond the 2014 World Cup group stages, but Redknapp believes it should be a different story next summer in France with the current crop of young players at England's disposal.

'There are some really talented players and Roy's squad for the Euros is going to the best we've had for some time,' the former QPR and Tottenham manager told talkSPORT.

'If we don't win the Euros we ought to give up because it's the best opportunity we're going to have. It's a really good group at the moment.'

Redknapp, who stepped down as QPR boss earlier this month, singled out the likes of Raheem Sterling, Daniel Sturridge, Harry Kane and Ross Barkley for special praise and believes they could help England claim their first piece of major silverware since the 1966 World Cup.

He added: 'England has got three or four young players emerging now in time for Euro 2016. Roy will have a team that can really compete.

'I would be disappointed if we don't at least get to the semi-finals and then I could see us having a real go at winning it.'

The candid interview also saw Redknapp describe his 2012 tax evasion court case as 'absolute nonsense', claim that Tottenham's board had 'blown the chance' to sign Eden Hazard and Thibaut Courtois, refer to Joey Barton as 'high-maintenance' and also criticise Adel Taarabt.
