Twenty thousand migrants a year are being let into Britain under a loophole that could be exploited by sham-marriage racketeers, a report warns today.

Under European law, EU nationals living in this country are allowed to bring in spouses or partners and their families from anywhere in the world with no checks or qualifications.

But British citizens who want to bring in a wife, husband or partner and family from abroad must first show they have an income of £18,600 or more to guarantee their dependants will not become a burden on the taxpayer.

Think-tank MigrationWatch UK warns 20,000 people are entering Britain through a migration loophole

The report by the MigrationWatch UK think-tank warns that 20,000 people a year are now coming to live in Britain as partners of a citizen of another EU country.

The loophole means the system is wide open to abuse by racketeers who can charge vast sums of money to set up a sham marriage, it said.

Sir Andrew Green of MigrationWatch said: ‘This is a loophole that must be closed and soon.

'It is absurd that EU citizens should be in a more favourable position than our own citizens.

'Furthermore, 20,000 per year is a very large number to admit unconditionally, especially compared to the government’s target of tens of thousands for annual net migration.’

Under the rules, a member of the family of an EU citizen - who has the right to travel to and work freely in Britain - can bring in their family under a ‘European Economic Area family permit’.

The permit is issued to any national of another EU country who is living in Britain and applies for it.

Under EU law, EU nationals living in the UK can bring their spouse or partner with no checks

The report said: ‘A Polish or French person can marry someone from outside the EU, say Kenya or Vietnam, and can bring their spouse into the UK, even if they do not have a job earning £18,600 or indeed any job.

‘The couple would be entitled to full access to the welfare state. A British or non-EU settled resident would not be allowed to bring in a spouse without this minimum income.’

A number of Indian nationals from the former Portuguese territory of Goa are thought to have taken advantage of the loophole. Indians living in Goa can claim they have Portuguese heritage and so claim Portuguese citizenship.

They can then move directly to Britain – without ever having to visit Portugal – and bring a family without meeting any qualification test.

A spokesman for the Home Office said: 'EU citizens do not have unrestricted access to the UK - they must be exercising their treaty rights by working, studying or being self-sufficient.

'The Prime Minister has recently announced a number of changes including strengthening residence testing and limiting the amount of time migrants can claim benefits.'
