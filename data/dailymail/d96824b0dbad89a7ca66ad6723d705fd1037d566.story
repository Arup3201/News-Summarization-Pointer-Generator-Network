Barack Obama today nominated Chuck Hagel as Pentagon chief, daring Republicans to block a decorated Vietnam veteran who 'bears the scars and the shrapnel of battles he fought in our name'. 

The nomination will trigger a fresh battle - that over his nomination in the United States Senate, where a number of Democrats are openly sceptical about the former Republican senator following his comments about 'the Jewish lobby' and opposition to 'an openly, aggressively gay' nominee as ambassador to Luxembourg. 

Obama's choice of the former two-term senator for Nebraska, revealed by congressional Democratic aides on Sunday, is likely to set up a gruelling confirmation fight in the Senate over whether Hagel supports key U.S. ally Israel after he previously called for negotiations with the Palestinian terrorist organisation Hamas.

Taking flak: Obama's nomination of Chuck Hagel today will trigger a fresh battle over his ability to take a seat in the Senate, where some Democrats are critical of his comments about 'the Jewish lobby'

So we need to get moving quickly on this.'

He said: 'Chuck Hagel is the leader that our troops deserve. He is an American patriot. He enlisted in the Army and volunteered for Vietnam. As a young private and then a sergeant, he served with honor alongside his own brother. Obama highlighted Hagel's Vietnam service, telling American troops: 'Just like Sergeant Hagel was always there for his own brother, Secretary Hagel will always be there for you.' He added: 'Chuck knows that war is not an abstraction.'

'When Chuck was hit by shrapnel, his brother saved him. When his brother was injured by a mine, Chuck risked his life to pull him to safety. To this day, Chuck bears the scars and the shrapnel from the battles he fought in our name.'

Hagel, 66, has been lambasted for comments he made questioning the effectiveness of sanctions on Iran 
for its nuclear program.

Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told CNN the choice would make Hagel 'the most antagonistic secretary of defence toward the state of Israel in our nation's history'.

'Not only has he said you should 
directly negotiate with Iran, sanctions won't work, that Israel should 
directly negotiate with the Hamas organization - a terrorist group that 
lobs thousands of rockets into Israel - he also was one of 12 senators 
who refused to sign a letter to the European Union that Hezbollah should
be designated as a terrorist organization.'

Divisive: Republican lawmakers have spoken out against the appointment of their former colleague

Previous posts include co-chairman of the President's Intelligence Advisory Board and member of the Defense Policy Board. U.S. senator, 1997-2009, and deputy administrator, U.S. Veterans Administration, 1981-1982.

Quote 'We are each a product of our experiences, and my time in combat very much shaped my opinions about war. I'm not a pacifist; I believe in using force, but only after following a very careful decision-making process' - Hagel in an October interview with Vietnam Magazine

He added that it would 'probably be a bridge too far' for him to back Hagel, a Vietnam veteran who initially voted for the Iraq war but loudly grew to oppose it and support Obama for president in 2008.

As such, 'he has long severed his ties with the Republican Party', Graham said. 'This is an in-your-face nomination by the president.'

Senator Graham is an Air Force reservist who serves on the Armed Services Committee which will consider the nomination when it is officially brought forward.

Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas also had disparaging words for Hagel, saying in a statement that he will not support the nomination as Hagel's 'record and past statements, particularly with respect to rogue nations like Iran, are extremely concerning to me'.

'As Iran becomes increasingly hostile
and gains influence in the region, the worst possible message we could 
send to our friend Israel and the rest of our allies in the Middle East 
is Chuck Hagel,' he added.

Another senior Republican aide added:
'I can't imagine why [Obama] would choose to burn his political capital
on this nomination. For what? There is no constituency for Chuck Hagel.
Obama will expend every ounce of political capital he has to get him 
across the finish line. Dems will hate this.'

Indeed, there is also a lack of support for Hagel among Democrats.

The controversy comes after the Obama
administration backed down from a tough Senate confirmation battle over
Susan Rice, the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. who was Obama's 
first pick to replace Hillary Clinton as secretary of state.

Rice withdrew her name from 
consideration after drawing heavy fire from Republicans for remarks she 
made in the aftermath of a September 11 attack on the U.S. mission in 
Benghazi, Libya.

'It is a strange signal for the White
House to send that they are willing to fight for Hagel but not Rice,' a
Senate Democratic aide said on Sunday, Politico reported.

'Democrats are not currently unified 
behind Hagel, and it will take some real work by the administration to 
get them there, if it's even possible.

'The administration floated Hagel's 
name, then neglected to defend him effectively when his critics started 
taking shots,' the aide said.

'I think there will be a lot of tough 
questions for Sen. Hagel,' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, 
R-Ky., added to NBC, 'but he will be treated fairly by Republicans in 
the Senate. I think he'll be subjected to the same kind of oversight 
hearings that any nominee for such an important position would expect.'

McConnell added his 'views with regard to Israel, for example, and Iran and all the other positions that he's taken over the years will be very much a matter of discussion in the confirmation process.'

Hagel has also offended gay rights groups on the left after he called then-President Bill Clinton's nominee for U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg James Hormel as 'openly, aggressively gay' in 1998.

He later apologized for the remark which he called 'insensitive'.

Last month Obama offered strong 
support for Hagel as a possible replacement for Defense Secretary Leon 
Panetta, who had said he wanted to leave early in the second term.

'I've served with Chuck Hagel,' Obama told NBC's 'Meet the Press' on December 30. 'I know 
him. He is a patriot. He is somebody who has done extraordinary work 
both in the United States Senate, somebody who served this country with 
valor in Vietnam.'

And Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, from North Dakota, also defended the selection of 'a tremendous patriot and statesman' who 'served incredibly in Vietnam'.

'He
hasn't had a chance to speak for himself. And so why all the 
prejudging?' she said on 'This Week'. 'In America, you give everybody a 
chance to speak for themselves and then we'll decide.'

Ducking out: The nomination comes after the Obama administration backed down from a tough battle for Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, to step in as secretary of state

Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin added that Hagel is recipient of two Purple Hearts from wounds he sustained in Vietnam and worked on the Senate Foreign Relations and Intelligence committees.

'Yes, he is a serious candidate if the president chooses to name him,' Durbin said.

If all Senate Democrats come together and support Hagel, it will be easier for him to win confirmation. Democrats now hold a 55-to-45 advantage over Republicans following the November election.

If they did unite, the White House would need just five Republican votes to confirm Hagel.

It would be rare for Republicans to reject the president's choice for defense secretary, especially one who is a Republican, just a month after voters voted him in for a second term, Politico reported.
