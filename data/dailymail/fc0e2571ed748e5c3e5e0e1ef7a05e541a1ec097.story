A 21-year-old student who was shot three times by a paranoid attorney at Florida State University last week has been left paralyzed from the waist down, his sister has revealed.

Farhan 'Ronny' Ahmed was one of three victims who were wounded by gunman Myron May, 31, a FSU graduate and an attorney, in the Tallahassee-based campus's Strozier Library last Thursday.

He was struck by three bullets, one of which severely damaged his spine, leaving the lower half of his body paralyzed, Farhana Ahmed told reporters at a news conference on Monday.

'Ronny was studying for his finals when he was shot three times,' she said. 'He immediately knew something was wrong because one of the first bullets struck his spine.

Aftermath: One student, who described the ordeal as 'one of the scariest nights of my life', posted a series of images of the chaos on Instagram. Above, a police officer  in Strozier Library, where Mr Ahmed was shot

'It's left him paralyzed from the waist down. But despite his injuries, he's alive and we're so grateful that he's here with us.'

Mr Ahmed, who was studying for his finals in biomedical engineering, was rushed to Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare with critical injuries following the shooting shortly before 12.30pm.

But during the conference, Miss Ahmed, whose family is from Orlando, said: 'His condition has been updated from critical to serious, which we're really thankful for.

She added that the entire community has supported her brother 'through this really hard time', with many locals having donated teddy bears and sent letters of encouragement.

Other victims: Library employee Nathan Scott (right), 30, who was shot in the leg, was released from the hospital last week.  Student, Elijah Velez (left), 18, was grazed by a bullet and was treated at the scene

Chaos: Mr Ahmed is the only victim who is still hospitalized. Officers shot and killed May outside the front entrance of the library within two minutes of the first 911 call. Above, chaos in the school following the attack

And she praised police for their 'quick thinking' within minutes of the incident, saying: 'I know the first people on the scene were the police,' according to WCTV.

'If not for their quick response, probably a lot more students would have gotten hurt. Ronny himself was probably saved by the quickness of their actions,' she added.  

Mr Ahmed is the only person who is still hospitalized from last week's shooting. Officers shot and killed May outside the front entrance of the library within two minutes of the first 911 call.

Library employee Nathan Scott, 30, who was shot in the leg, was released from hospital last week. 

Scared crowds: May tried to enter the library, where at least 400 students were studying for midterm exams last Thursday morning. Above, students are pictured in the Strozier library at the time of the shooting

Clear-out: Students raise their hands as police clear out the fourth floor of the building after the shooting

Escape: Student Jason Derfuss posted a picture of a book he was carrying in his back pack at the time of the shooting at Florida State University in Tallahassee on Facebook. He believes the orange book saved his life

Meanwhile, another student, Elijah Velez, 18, was grazed by a bullet as he climbed off his bike. He was treated and released at the scene, according to CBS Miami.

In the seconds leading up to the shooting, May reloaded at least once and tried to enter the library, where at least 400 students were studying for midterm exams.

However, he was blocked by lobby security barriers that permit only students and staff inside.

When police arrived at the scene, officers fired off a barrage of bullets that killed him. FSU officials noted the security barriers were put in place in late 2008 - or after May had already left the school.

Response: FSU President John Thrasher, who has met with Mr Ahmed's family, said the school is '100 percent committed to ensuring"'it does what it can to help the victim graduate as planned. Above, police at the scene

Emotional: Students are seen hugging as they gather for a vigil in the aftermath of the attack on the library

On Monday, FSU President John Thrasher, who has met with Mr Ahmed's family, said the school is '100 percent committed to ensuring"'it does what it can to help the victim graduate as planned

The student's friends have already started raising money on a YouCaring page to help fund his medical expenses. They have so far raised more than $63,000.

Classes resumed a day after the shooting and the library reopened. But it could be weeks before the investigation is wrapped up, according to WSB-TV.

Police are likely to question witnesses again, and a grand jury will review the actions of campus police and Tallahassee police, who killed May.

Hospital: Mr Ahmed has been upgraded from critical to serious at Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare (above)

Videos and a journal obtained by police indicate May, who went on to graduate from law school at Texas Tech, thought he was being watched and targeted by the government. 

He also complained to police and property managers in New Mexico that cameras were watching him in his apartment, it is said.

And he claimed that he heard voices talking about and laughing at him, according to police reports released last week.
