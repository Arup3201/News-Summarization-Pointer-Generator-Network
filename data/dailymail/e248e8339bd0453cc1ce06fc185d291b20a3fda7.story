Roberto Martinez has launched a defence of the much-maligned Europa League and called it ‘stupid’ to suggest Everton are not intent on winning the competition.

Premier League managers have often hinted that European football’s second-tier tournament is a nuisance clogging the fixture list, but Martinez believes Goodison Park thrives on such nights.

Everton claimed their first league victory of the season and now welcome Wolfsburg to Merseyside on Thursday as they make their way through seven matches in 23 days.

‘Last year we had to work so hard for 38 games to achieve that, it would be nonsense to say we don’t want to be giving it everything we’ve got,’ he said.

‘As long as people understand that making changes to the line-up doesn’t mean you don’t care about a competition. We really want to go all the way in the Europa League.’ Lille and Russian side Krasnodar are also in Group H.

‘We’re excited because those teams will bring a completely different tactical approach and we will benefit from that,’ added Martinez. ‘Everton have to be in Europe. It is a priority for us. Maybe we were not ready for the Champions League, even though we fought hard to get into it. This is the perfect next step for us.’

Romelu Lukaku scored for Everton against West Brom, with whom he spent a season on loan

For Alan Irvine, the landscape is more modest. Albion’s new head coach is still searching for his first win, and after Romelu Lukaku and Kevin Mirallas scored, he had to endure jeers from his own fans.

But Irvine asked for time as he tries to mould together a squad which has 11 new faces. Georgios Samaras and Sebastian Blanco came on for their debuts but Joleon Lescott is yet to play because of injury.

‘You can’t throw a team together overnight,’ he said. ‘But I understand that you can’t lose games too often, and that if you do, then it becomes extremely difficult.

'I’ll keep working to get the lads gelled into the best team we can be as quickly as possible.’

Captain Chris Brunt was booed by sections of Albion supporters as he was substituted in unsavoury scenes reminiscent of last season.

‘It is ridiculous that somebody who has been an incredible servant to this club gets that,’ raged Ben Foster, at fault for Mirallas’s goal. ‘We need our supporters to support us.’
