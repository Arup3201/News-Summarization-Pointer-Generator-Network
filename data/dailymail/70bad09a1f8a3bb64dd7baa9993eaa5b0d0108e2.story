An 11-year-old girl was suspended for five days for filming her teacher threatening another child in her science class last week.

The Fort Pierce Elementary School science teacher, whose identity has not been revealed, has been fired following the incident and fifth grader Brianna Cooper still doesn't understand why the school has decided to punish her for doing what she thought was the right thing.

'Don’t let the size fool you. I will drop you,' Cooper recorded her teacher saying with her cell phone.

Suspended:Fifth grader Brianna Cooper, 11, was suspended for five days for filming her teacher bullying another child in the class last week even though her teacher was fired for the remarks

Recording is illegal: Fort Pierce Elementary School fired the teacher but says since recording someone without letting them know is illegal that they had to suspend Brianna Cooper for taping the incident

'Yeah right,' the young male student could be heard replying.

'You don’t know me. That's all I'm telling you. So don't give me no look,' said the Florida teacher to a student in her class.

'Biggest kid in the fifth grade and you acting like the smallest one. I wonder what your mom looks like,' continued the video.

Cooper took the recording to school officials who said that recording a teacher without permission is illegal because the teacher had an expectation of privacy, reports KDVR.

'I never had anyone tell me, "you cannot record,"' said Cooper, who at 11-years-old doesn't have a full knowledge of Florida law. 

Brianna Cooper's mother Kassie Faulkner told KDVR she believes that her daughter's suspension sends the wrong message to students who should be 'encouraged to do the right thing.'

She also fears for her daughter's test scores and says that the five days the Brianna Cooper was suspended are the days that the students are meant to be studying for the Florida Standards Assessment. 

An official at the school could not be reached for comment. 

Shouldn't be punished: Brianna Cooper's mother Kassie Faulkner says that her daughter's suspension doesn't send a healthy message to kids who now think they'll be punished for 'doing the right thing'
