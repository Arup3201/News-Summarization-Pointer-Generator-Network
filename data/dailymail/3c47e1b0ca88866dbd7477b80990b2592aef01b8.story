'Disappointed': Dee Dee Knudson, pictured,  used the n-word in a video of her own shortly after being bullied with it

A father who emotionally documented racial abuse and slurs targeted at his adopted daughter was shocked to find the teenage girl using the same words herself.

Bradley Knudson, of Lake Prior, Minnesota, recorded messages sent to his African American daughter which called her a 'n*****' and a 'sl**' and posted them to Youtube.

Knudson, whose white family adopted Dee Dee, 14, when she was three years old, also shared a message from the bullies' family referring to him as a 'n*****-lover', after attempting to speak to them failed.

But despite winning an apology off the back of the video, which has now been seen more than 2.5million times, Knudson found that his daughter had taken to using the offensive term herself.

In a video recorded on her cellphone - and in front of a news crew from local station WCCO - Dee Dee excitedly said 'Let's go n*****. Let's go!' to her audience.

According WCCO, on finding out Knudson said: 'I am very, very disappointed that my daughter at first did not learn from this experience.'

In an online comment on the issue, he added: 'Regardless of your skin color I and my wife do not tolerate this word our daughter is going to be reprimanded in an appropriate manner.

'I am extremely saddened and disappointed because of this video she has discredited the message that we wanted to convey.'

Dee Dee later apologized, saying: 'I was excited and not paying attention to what I was saying but I did use it in a different meaning.'

'Disappointed': Knudson said he will punish his daughter for using the term in a SnapChat video of her own, which she is seen composing above

Family: Dee Dee was adopted by the Knudson family when she was three years old. Until the latest incident, the family had never encountered any hostile reactions beyond the occasional stare

Deron Puro, whose children sent the first wave of offensive messages from their cellphones, has since been fired from his job, and issued a full apology.

He had originally told Knudson that he saw no problem with his children using racial slurs as it was commonplace in their home and he did it himself.

According to Knudson, Dee Dee receiving a barrage of offensive messages via SnapChat, an app which sends brief messages and pictures which automatically delete themselves.

After three similar messages which repeatedly used the n-word, Knudson was able to record a fourth, and used it to confront the Puro family, who were recalcitrant at first. 

But after their about-face, the Puro family issued a statement acknowledging it was wrong - and saying that recovering addict Deron was intoxicated at the time.

In shock: He showed the video of the twin boys calling his daughter a 'sl**' and a 'n*****' on Snapchat

Fired: Deron Puro, pictured with his sons, said he stood by his racist comments and did not care if Mr Knudson shared his messages online. Since Mr Knudson shared his name in the video, he has been fired from his job

It said: 'The Puro family is not racist, nor do we use the n-word lightly in our household. What happened was very unfortunate for both families, and we hope each family can heal and move on from this.

'...Deron has recently become aware of his actions and is sincerely sorry for how he acted. He understands that what he did was uncalled for and is unforgivable.'

The school district is also investigating the incident, and may punish the Puro children itself.
