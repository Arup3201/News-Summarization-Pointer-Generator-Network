There is no doubt that older women are now living dramatically different and more exciting lives. And perhaps no one illustrates this point better than Joanna Trollope, who earlier this week opened up about the inner workings of her relationship with a man 23 years younger than her.

She has been with Jason Kouchak, 47, for more than a decade, and seems to suggest that this success is partly  due to the fact they are in an open relationship.

For 70-year-old Miss T confesses that she's not that fussed about fidelity. 'At my age, loyalty and trust are more important than monogamy. While women are fertile, I think sexual loyalty is crucial. But as time goes on you shrug a bit.'

Well, I didn't shrug when I read this. I don't see many of my friends shrugging either, when they're unfortunate enough to find incriminating evidence of 'playing away' in their partner's phone or pockets.

I say this as a single woman in her 60s, who has been thus since my partner, architect Christopher Bowerbank, died more than a decade ago.

I admit I've no idea if I shall have a relationship again, but one thing is certain: I most  certainly wouldn't settle for a relationship which was deceitful and uncommitted.

For even though Christopher and I never got as far as living together, we were partners on and off for about 10 years.  We split up twice and I loathed seeing him with other women, even when I was dating someone else.

Happily, very happily, in the last few years it became a monogamous relationship and we finally reached a plateau of understanding and trust.

For the brutal fact of the matter is that infidelity and open relationships never work if  you are emotionally attached  to someone, no matter how old you are.

The laid-back attitude to fidelity shown by Trollope, and also by 60-year-old Monica Porter, who has written a new confessional book about a wild year spent sleeping around with  15 much younger men, shows  a strange lack of self-esteem and principle.

It is not a sign of emancipation to accept your partner having other girlfriends, but a Faustian pact of the flesh.

I admit when you hear it discussed by Miss Trollope, it sounds like a clever and thoroughly pragmatic way of keeping a man interested. And also a way of keeping the tap flowing for lots of enthusiastic sex at  an age when many women are happily resigned to celibacy.

There must be an immense price to pay, however, for these cougars. Open relationships are emotionally draining and painful - not for nothing are they one of the great theatrical themes of all time.

Any woman with children would surely find such an arrangement too painful as she and their father have so much shared experience invested in their partnership.

And even with no children, the experience of an 'open relationship' would be utterly brutal. It takes a supremely confident woman not to have her esteem battered by the inevitable imaginings of where you fall in your lover's pecking order and your body being compared to other, younger bodies. It can only  end in tears.

Perhaps it really is Miss Trollope who is setting the ground rules. Maybe her pragmatism in allowing him freedom - they do not live together - works very well for her, an independent woman reported to be worth Â£15â€‰million.

She has two marriages and two children under her belt. She looks like she 'has it all'.But what if Joanna wanted more? What if she wanted Jason to move in? Where would the power balance shift then?  Not in Joanna's favour, I  would guess.

As we age, intimacy and companionship become even more vital than in our youth. I can see why many women - and men - of a certain age would consider tolerating countless humiliations just in order to have someone in their lives.

When I asked a friend of mine, who is around my age, what she thought of Miss Trollope's arrangement she said: 'Does she wrap his Christmas presents?' - code in 'Aga Sagas' for a proper relationship.

Women like Joanna Trollope and Monica Porter may have lost sight of such minor but telling acts of love.

They are so busy being sexy and independent I wonder what they do on Sunday nights.

For it is on this night of the week that I miss my deceased partner most. It wasn't so much the nights we were out at parties - I can manage those on my own perfectly well, thank you - but the companionable evenings in, when we would cook supper and watch an undemanding TV programme together. It was very cosy  and comforting.

Companionship is the name of the game as we age and all my friends who have lost partners tell me that it is this they miss most.

Could I enjoy such intimacy with someone if I knew he had other options the following night? I don't think so.

There have been such dramatic changes in the lives of older women recently. A decade ago, women in their 60s and  70s spent their time at the bridge table and on the golf course. Now a great number of us continue to work.

Attitudes to sex have also changed beyond all recognition: the bedroom is not just a place to sleep, but just as much of  a playground as it was before children came along.

But equally we lose sight of  the important things in life at our peril.

What baby boomers like Porter and Trollope have not worked out is how they want to spend their fourth age.

When they become frail, will they still be content with no-strings relationships?

The final leg of our journey still needs to be travelled. But who with? The young man from the gym or the contemporary who shares the same jokes, the same language and who will pick you up when you fall?
