Tony Abbott's daughter has received a scholarship for a university degree costing more than $60,000 from a long-time friend of the Prime Minister, it has been revealed.

The news comes on the same day that thousands of students have protested across Australia about the cuts to tertiary education funding, announced in Mr Abbott's federal budget.

Frances Abbott, 22, accepted a 'chairman's scholarship' for her Bachelor of Design course from the Whitehouse Institute of Design, where Liberal supporter Les Taylor sits as chairman on the board of governors.

Frances Abbott was awarded a $60,000 scholarship at Whitehouse Institute of Design in Sydney

'Frances definitely was a student with us and received a chairman's scholarship,' Leanne Whitehouse, director of the Institute told Guardian Australia.Â 

The fashion student studied at the Sydney institute from 2011 to December 2013 and received the award as a result of her 'application and art portfolio', a spokeswoman for the Prime Minister said.

Mr Abbott has not declared the scholarship on his pecuniary interest register, despite previously declaring other matters relating to his children such as trips, accommodation and tickets to sporting events.

Current laws rule that members of the House of Representatives are required to declare gifts of more than $300 when they are given to themselves, their spouses and dependent children and come from non-official sources.

However, a spokeswoman has denied that Mr Abbott needed to disclose his daughter's scholarship as it did not constitute a gift.

'Under the statement of Registrable Interests, a scholarship is not a gift it is an award based on merit and disclosure is not required,' she said in a statement.

'If alternative advice is provided, Mr Abbott will meet the amended requirements.'

Guidelines currently say gifts from family members or personal friends 'need not be registered unless the member judges that an appearance of conflict of interest may be seen to exist'.

Mr Abbott has known the Institute's chairman Mr Taylor for many years, the Prime Minister's office said.

When Mr Abbott was in opposition he received clothing from him as a gift in February 2012 and April 2013.

'While the exact cost of the gifts were not known, it was clear they were higher than the $300 threshold and were appropriately disclosed, with Mr Abbott providing all the information required by an opposition member,' Mr Abbott's spokeswoman said.

Frances graduated with distinction-level in 2013 and is currently working for Whitehouse as a teacher's aide in Melbourne.

She aims to continue her studies with a Masters degree course later this year and is now a regular front-row fixture at Australian fashion shows.

Details of Frances' scholarship emerged as students campaigned against the Abbott government's changes to tertiary education in cities around the country.

In a major shake-up, universities, TAFEs and colleges will be able to chose the tuition fees they want to charge for their courses from 2016. This is estimated to save the government $1.1 billion over the next three years.

The institute that Frances attended is likely to benefit from the federal government's changes to subsidies, which previously did not cover private colleges.

Mr Abbott attended last year's graduation ceremony at the institute in support of his daughter and gave a speech praising its work.

On Wednesday masses of students turned out for a national day of protest, organised by The National Union of Students.

Melbourne saw the most tense conflict, however demonstrations in Sydney, Canberra and Brisbane also caused chaos.

In Sydney, a man in his 20s was arrested for picking up an already-lit flare and 'bundled to the ground by about six police officers,' AAP reported.

Hundreds of police officers wearing fluoro vests packed the streets around Melbourne's parliament house as young people marched.

In Queensland, similar scenes led to the shutting down of chunks of the Brisbane CBD. In Canberra, furious young men and women banged on the windows of government buildings.

The Prime minister was forced to cancel a scheduled visit to Deakin University in Melbourne due to the demonstrations on Wednesday.

National Union of Students president Deanna Taylor told the ABC the cancellation of his visit was a missed opportunity for protesters to have their voices heard.

'If [Coalition frontbenchers] are there to sell a budget that will savage higher education, we're not going to cop it on the chin easily,' she said.

On Monday, former Liberal MP Sophie Mirabella had to be escorted by police out of a lecture at Melbourne University after it was disrupted by protesters.

And last Friday, at Sydney University, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop was mobbed by students who were angry about planned changes.
