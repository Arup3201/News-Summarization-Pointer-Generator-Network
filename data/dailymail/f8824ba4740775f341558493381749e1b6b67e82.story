Mike Ashley may now hold the key to the power battle at Rangers after it was confirmed he has more than doubled his stake at Ibrox.

A statement to the Stock Exchange revealed French bank BNP Paribas purchased 4.26 million shares from fund managers Hargreave Hale on behalf of the Newcastle United owner earlier this week.

The £850,000 deal leaves Ashley with an 8.9 per cent stake in the club. He is currently limited to under 10 per cent via an agreement with the SFA but already has significant commercial influence at Ibrox through the retail contracts held by his Sports Direct firm. He also owns the naming rights to the stadium.

There were suggestions last night that Ashley could now go further by pushing for an Extraordinary General Meeting to force a shake-up of the Ibrox board.

The billionaire tycoon is perceived as being the main rival to Dave King and his allies in the struggle over Rangers’ long-term future and this latest development could yet prove significant.

King has previously stated a willingness to invest up to £30million, but those funds would only be forthcoming in a new share issue that provided boardroom control.

Such a move would require the backing of 75 per cent of Rangers shareholders and substantially weaken the existing powerbase.

While Ashley’s intentions are not yet clear, he has now upped his potential ability to contribute to any veto.

His investment comes after last week’s confirmation that football board chairman Sandy Easdale – who has publically backed Ashley – holds voting rights over a 26.1 per cent stake. The Union of Fans have already urged Easdale not to oppose a new share issue that would open the door for King.

Ashley declined to invest in the stop-gap £3.13m open offer Rangers held last month and the £850,000 he has now splashed out will not go to the club as he increased his stake via the market.

The troubled Ibrox outfit are likely to experience another cash shortfall by the end of the year, with reports on Tyneside previously speculating that Ashley could consider offering a substantial loan to provide funding.

The Londoner has become the second largest single shareholder in Rangers behind Laxey Partners but currently has limited scope to up his personal holding due to SFA guidelines on dual ownership.

Any attempt to move beyond 10 per cent would have to go before the board of the governing body, backed by a detailed business case.

However, his financial power and commercial contracts already establish him as a pivotal player even on his existing stake.

Meanwhile, Rangers have accepted an SFA ban for Bilel Mohsni but will contest the suspension offered to Kris Boyd.

Mohsni was cited by new compliance officer Tony McGlennan for appearing to strike Liam Fontaine during Monday night’s 3-1 defeat from Hibernian. The Tunisian centre-back will serve a total of three games under SFA rules as he was sent off during a pre-season friendly against Derby.

Boyd was charged over a head-to-head confrontation with Jordan Forster but the Ibrox club have rejected the two-game ban put forward. His case will now go before a principal hearing next Thursday.
