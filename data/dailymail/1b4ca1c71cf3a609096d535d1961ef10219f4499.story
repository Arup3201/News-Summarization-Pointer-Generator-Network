Greedy: Sara Beale pictured leaving court today after pleading guilty to stealing more than £10,00 from her elderly father

A daughter stole more than £10,000 from her frail father as he battled Alzheimer’s in a nursing home - to fund her online gambling addiction.

Sara Beale, 45, blew the cash on shopping and ‘evil’ internet betting rather than her 70-year-old father Brian Beale’s care, a court heard.

Beale, who regularly withdrew money from her father’s account over 10 months, has walked free from court after pleading guilty to theft.

He initially received respite care at home for his health problems, including Alzheimer’s disease, Southampton Crown Court heard.

But his behaviour became difficult to manage and it was arranged that he would move into a home full time.

Beale - who has a young son herself - met with social services and the home and agreed to pay £158 a week from her dad’s funds to cover costs.

But no money arrived and she later wrote a letter to social services saying she was no longer responsible for his finances and he should be invoiced.

Authorities decided her father was unfit to look after his accounts and agreed they would take control.

A trawl of his bank records revealed the elderly man’s pension was still going in - but his daughter had taken out £10,167 over 10 months.

Beale was arrested and initially denied taking the money, but later admitted it and said she had spent it on gambling and trying to pay off debts.

Judge Derwin Hope handed Beale, from Sholing, Hampshire, a 12-month suspended sentence and 200 hours’ community work.

Sentencing, Judge Hope said: 'Gambling is an evil addiction, you got caught up in it and committed this high breach of trust.'
