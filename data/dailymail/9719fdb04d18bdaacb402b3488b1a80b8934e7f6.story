Rock legend Eric Clapton's watch is expected to sell for an incredible £2.6million at auction.

The ultra-rare Patek Philippe perpetual calendar chronograph timepiece, one of just two made in rare precious metal platinum, is to go on sale at Christie's in Geneva on Monday.

The other platinum Patek Philippe is in a museum. The item is one of 310 exclusive watches, collectively worth $16million (£9.9million), being auctioned by the firm.

Time is money: Rocker Eric Clapton's Patek Philippe watch will go on sale for an expected £2.6million next week

Clapton's platinum 2499 watch, which was first launched in 1951, was first put on sale in 1989 and is expected to fetch between £1.7million and £2.6million.

The news of the platinum watch sale comes after a Gerhard Richter painting belonging to the guitarist and singer was sold for £21.3million at Sotheby's in London, a world record price for a living artist. He bought the work for £2m in 2001.

Clapton, who is worth £140million, studied art for a year before his career took off and has used some of his fortune to build an art collection.

Also being auctioned on the day is a 
diamond estimated to be worth as much $25million. The Archduke Joseph 
Diamond is described as internally flawless and weighs 76 carats.

It
was originally sourced from the Golconda mines in India, which produced
the Koh-i-Noor of the UK's Crown Jewels, and is named after Archduke 
Joseph August of Austria, a member of the royal House of Habsburg whose family owned the stone until the 1930s.

Valuable: The ultra-rare Patek Philippe perpetual calendar chronograph timepiece, one of just two made in rare precious metal platinum, is displayed by staff at Christie's

Guitar hero: Clapton is regarded as the one of the most influential guitarists of all time. He has won seventeen Grammy Awards and in 2004 was awarded a CBE at Buckingham Palace for services to music
