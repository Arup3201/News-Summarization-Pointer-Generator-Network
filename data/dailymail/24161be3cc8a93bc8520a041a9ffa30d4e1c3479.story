Manchester City accept they will have to sell one of their foreign stars if Eliaquim Mangala joins the club from FC Porto in a £32million deal.

The Premier League champions remain cautiously optimistic that Mangala, 23, will move to the Etihad following their lengthy pursuit of the French centre-back.

But with City restricted to 17 overseas players over the age of 21 in the Premier League – and one fewer in the Champions League next season after breaching Financial Fair Play regulations – Alvaro Negredo and Javi Garcia are the players most in danger of being sacrificed.

Negredo is understood to have told City that he wants to return to Spain amid interest from La Liga champions Atletico Madrid, while Garcia has attracted interest from Napoli.

Matija Nastasic could also be sold if Mangala’s arrival pushes him further down the pecking order of centre-backs in Manuel Pellegrini’s squad.

Nastasic does not count towards the overseas quota at the moment because he qualifies as an Under-21 player but that will change next season.
