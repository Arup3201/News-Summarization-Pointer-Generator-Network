Tony Blair's son Nicky, pictured in 2006, has set himself up as a football agent and could make thousands from the Brazil World Cup

The son of former Prime Minister Tony Blair looks set to make thousands off the back of the World Cup after signing up top players to his football agency business.

Nicky Blair, 28, starting representing footballers after leaving Oxford University and reportedly made a massive sum from brokering the transfer of Mexican Hector Herrera last year.

The players he represents - including fellow Mexican rising star Marco Fabian - could now make the agent even more cash if they perform well at the World Cup in Brazil.

Fabian, 24, impressed when he was brought on during his nation's 1-0 win over Cameroon yesterday, increasing speculation he could be about to move to a top European club.

It is thought Nicky Blair could earn around 10% of any fee given to the player as well as a cut of his future earnings, adding to his growing empire.

Nicky, helped by his university friend Gabriel Moraes, set up agency Magnitude after teaching in an inner city school following university.

It is thought they have signed up a number of young South American players with a view to cashing in if the youngsters make it big in Europe.

Herrera, 24, was one of his first successes when he moved from Mexican outfit Pachuca to Portuguese team FC Porto for £6.7million last year.

Fabian's estimated £10million value means he could make Nicky even more money, with Premiership teams reportedly interested.

The Mirror reported today that Nicky's firm also has a number of Brazilian stars on its books, including Marlon Barbosa of club side Fluminese and Leandro Alves of Botafoga.

It is thought mother Cherie is supportive of the venture and has allowed her son to use a desk at her business in central London.

The money would put Nicky on his way to emulating his father's growing fortune, which is estimated at £80million.

Meanwhile, Mr Blair's eldest son, Euan, is expected to follow his father into politics and has been tipped to run for election in Bootle, Merseyside.

Younger sister Kathryn has gone into law, also like her parents, and worked for the same inn of court her parents Tony and Cherie joined in the 1970s.

Mr Blair's 14-year-old youngest son Leo, who was the first child born to a serving Prime Minister in over 150 years in 2000, is meanwhile said to be 'musically gifted'
