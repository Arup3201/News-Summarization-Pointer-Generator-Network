The number of children who own a mobile phone has fallen for the first time as they turn to tablet computers to access the internet.

The overall number of children aged five
 to 15 owning a mobile fell from 49 per cent last year to 43 per cent this year, the 
first decrease since Ofcom began compiling the figures in 2005.

This was mainly because the proportion 
of eight to 11-year-olds who own a basic mobile phone - as opposed to a 
smartphone - fell steeply to 15 per cent from 28 per cent last year.

Ofcom has revealed that tablet use in five to 15-year-olds has risen sharply from 14 per cent to 42 per cent

Among this age group, 18 per cent now own a smartphone and the same proportion own a tablet computer.

While the smartphone figure is largely stable year-on-year, tablet ownership has grown four-fold among eight to 11-year-olds since last year's figure of 4 per cent.

Smartphones remain more widely used among older children aged 12 to 15, with 62 per cent owning one, but 26 per cent now own a tablet computer, up from just 7 per cent last year.

Tablet computers are becoming a must-have device for children of all ages, according to Ofcom's figures.

The use of tablets has tripled among five to 15-year-olds, up from 14 per cent to 42 per cent since 2012, and more than a quarter of three and four-year-olds now use a tablet computer at home.

Tablet usage is also rising rapidly among five to seven-year-olds, up from 11 per cent last year to 39 per cent, and eight to 11-year-olds, up from 13 per cent last year to 44 per cent.

The age groups are five times more likely than last year to use mostly a tablet when accessing the internet at home.

The proportion of children mainly using a laptop, netbook or desktop computer to use the internet has fallen from 85 per cent last year to 68 per cent.

Children with smartphones send an estimated 184 instant messages (IM) in a typical week, while those aged 12 to 15 send an average of 255 text messages per week, up from 193 last year.

Around one in five eight to 11-year-olds now say they mostly use the internet in their bedroom, up from 12 per cent last year.

Conversely, the proportion with a TV in the bedroom has fallen to 52 per cent from 59 per cent last year, while 47 per cent of five to 15-year-olds have a games console in their bedroom compared with 56 per cent last year.

More than four in 10 parents of five to 15-year-olds who use a home PC, laptop or netbook to go online say they have some kind of parental controls in place.

In a similar study, lifestyle websiteÂ goodtoknow.co.uk found 94 per cent of parents use their own technology devices in a similar way to dummies; to pacify the children and act as a distraction tool.

In total, 80 per cent of goodtoknow.co.uk readers said they personalise their mobile phone devices specifically for their kids by downloading up to ten apps.

The research also found that 77 per cent of children under the age of ten use their parents' devices on a daily basis, with 91.2 per cent using it to play games and browse the web.

Some 8.8 per cent use it for their homework.

More than two thirds of (71 per cent) of parents think that devices should automatically come with stricter parental controls.

Although 18 per cent of internet users aged 12 to 15 say they know how to change online filters or controls, just six per cent say they have done so in the past year.

A quarter of parents of five to 15-year-old internet users are concerned about cyberbullying, while one in seven said they were concerned about their child cyberbullying somebody else.

The findings are part of Ofcom's report Children And Parents: Media Use And Attitudes, which examines how children access and use different types of media and the role parents play in overseeing them.
