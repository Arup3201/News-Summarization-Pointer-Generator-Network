Three young women have burned to death in a club Romania after the owner neglected to tell firemen they were still inside.

Mihaela Tuca, 24, Nicoleta Vasiliteanu, 23, and 22-year-old Nicoleta Cengher all died after flames gutted a restaurant in the popular coastal town of Constanta where they were working illegally.

The trio had gone to the locker room upstairs when smoke started filling the venue in the early hours of Sunday, trapping them. Eventually the floor collapsed, dumping them on to the fire below.

A fourth dancer, 19-year-old Nicoleta Buirencu, was still on stage when the fire took hold and was pulled out by firefighters, but was badly burned

A fourth dancer, 19-year-old Nicoleta Buirencu, was still dancing on stage when the blaze started and was pulled out alive, although she was badly burned.

George Karam, 60, owner of the Beirut Club in the popular seaside resort of Constanta just east of the capital Bucharest, fled together with guests and staff when the fire broke out.

Firemen believed the building had been evacuated, but when they searched the building three hours later after the fire had burned out, they discovered the bodies of the performers.

Mariana Szarkany, Nicoleta Cengher’s mother, said: 'That owner is an evil man. He counted his chefs, he counted his waiters, he counted his bartenders.

'Why did he not tell them about the other girls? Did he forget about them? Did he forgot about those who were the stars of the show and brought all the glamour?'

Nicoleta Vasiliteanu’s mother Maria added: 'They brought my girl's body out and took her to the morgue.

'I saw the place burning, had I known my girl was upstairs, I would have gone through the fire for her! Why didn’t they tell me? Why did the boss say all the personnel had been evacuated?'

The blaze broke out on Sunday morning and gutted the Lebanese restaurant in Constanta

A friend of the girls said: 'It is so tragic, Miheala had been working as an exotic dancer since she was a teenager and really struggled to get some recognition.

'She didn't want to simply be one of the people that gets undressed on stage and wanted to bring something a bit more classy to the area, she had a very tasteful act which she had really worked on over the winter that involved belly dancing and a lot of acrobatics, she made all the costumes herself and worked out the routines.

'Things had finally started to come together for her. She and the others were really packing in the crowds and it looked like it was going to be a great season, and then finally this happens.'

Miss Tuca had been working in the region as a dancer since she was a teenager, and was looking forward to a bumper summer season after landing on offer to dance at the club.

She brought along her friend Miss Vasiliteanu to join the show, and the pair also recruited Miss Cengher, a singer, along with business student Miss Buirencu who was looking to subsidise her student loan.

The four made their own costumes and had managed to get a huge following in the first month working at the Lebanese restaurant, which also had an adjoining casino.

On the night of the fire, three of the girls had just finished a performance and gone upstairs to the locker room leaving Miss Buirencu on stage.

Survivors of the blaze said that thick smoke had suddenly started to fill the building, and everyone had fled at the same time.

When firemen arrived, they went into the restaurant and managed to pull Miss Buirencu to safety.

But they said that they had not been told about the other dancers, all of whom were working in the building illegally.

A fire brigade spokesman confirmed: 'When the blaze was extinguished, we went inside to dampen it down. That was three hours later, and it was only then that we found the three badly burned bodies.

'They must have been trapped upstairs by the smoke, and probably waited in vain for rescue that never came.

All four of the women had been working at the club illegally, and police are now investigating

'Nobody told us they were there, and at some stage the floor of the room they were in collapsed, dumping their bodies into the burning restaurant below.'

Police confirmed they were investigating the allegations that the restaurant had not applied the proper safety procedures, and for not having the correct paperwork for the people they had working there.
