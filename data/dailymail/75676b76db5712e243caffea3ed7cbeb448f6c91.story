Barcelona midfielder Sergio Busquets was carried off on a stretcher against Villarreal on Wednesday night and the club face a nervous wait to see if the injury will rule him out of the second-leg Champions League game with Manchester City in two weeks time.

Villarreal midfielder Tomas Pina was not booked for the challenge on the Spain international but was sent off in the second half for an even worse challenge on Neymar who also had his ankles wrapped in the Copa del Rey semi-final.

Busquets was caught at the end of the first half when Pina followed through on a pass and went straight through Busquets right ankle.

Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu said after the game: 'There is no damage to the bone but the ligaments are affected so it could be a slow recovery'.

He is almost certainly out of Sunday’s clash with Rayo Vallecano. Barca play Eibar the following weekend before facing Manchester City on Wednesday 18.
