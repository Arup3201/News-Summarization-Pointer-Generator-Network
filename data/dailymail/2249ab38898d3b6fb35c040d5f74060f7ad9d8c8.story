A nine-year-old boy was locked in a tiny cage then forced to stand half-naked in a pond as punishment for stealing.

Jin Hung's cruel castigation by neighbours caused outrage in China after pictures were shared on social media.

Locals Yuan Kang, 35, and Cheng Yeh, 40, decided to mete out their own justice after accusing him of stealing food and money from the village, the People's Daily Online reports.

Shivering: Nine-year-old Jin Hung was stripped to his waist and forced to stand in a pond while locals shouted abuse at him for stealing 

He was first locked in a cage so small he could not stand up and told to reflect on his crime.

When this failed to make him cry, he was stripped down to his waist and made to stand in the pond while villagers hurled insults.

His ordeal only ended when Jin's parents called the police and the neighbours were made to let the shivering youngster go and fined £20 each.

But Yuan remained unrepentant, arguing it would teach the child a lesson. 

He said: 'We all knew in the village that there was somebody stealing, if it wasn't eggs from our henhouse or vegetables, it was cash from inside empty properties.

'When he was caught red-handed we went round to his house and demanded to see inside his room, where we found a jar filled with money hidden under his bed.

'This was obviously his ill gotten gains, and he needed to be taught a lesson that stealing is wrong.' 

Pictures of the boy's ordeal were later published on Weibo sparking a debate. While many argued that the adults should be locked in a cage for child cruelty, others agreed the punishment would teach him a lesson.
