At first glance, it looks like this suburban semi is under attack from a huge mutant spider, creeping close to the upstairs window.

But look again and there's also a comical Dracula figurine on the hedge, a fluorescent skull by the door and a torso hanging from the gutter.

Never mind badgers... Mr Bird, 40, has had trouble with zombies emerging from graves in his garden this year

Makes a change from Scrabble in the living room: Mr Bird (far right) has always enjoyed playing tricks on his friends but decided to put his talents to good use three years ago and raise money for various charities

This year, Mr Bird (right) - who opens his doors each Halloween to raise money for his youngest daughter's special needs school - has made it the spookiest year yet, by installing a graveyard

To heighten the fear factor, the 40-year-old also kits out his three-bedroom house with cobwebs, pumpkins, ghosts, bats, skeletons and even coffins.

Then he and his wife Michelle, 23, dress up as zombies to welcome visitors - terrifying them with eerie music as they give them a guided tour.

This year, Mr Bird - who opens his doors each Halloween to raise money for his youngest daughter’s school - has made it the spookiest year yet, by installing a graveyard.

Drawing on his skill as a builder, he said: 'Michelle thinks I am totally stark raving mad - but she enjoys it all really and she says she wouldn’t have me any other way.

'Believe it or not, I can’t stand horror movies but I love dressing up and I love a bit of a laugh and a joke.'

Mr Bird, who gets donations from local stores to build props, said: 'I decided that Halloween would be the best occasion to do it, and in the first year I just decorated the living room and we raised near to £1,000 for Help the Heroes, which was great.

'So the next year, I decided to go a little further and decorate the whole house for my daughter’s school Manor High in Altrincham. It’s a special needs school and all the kids there are helping to paint the gravestones for me.

'It’s spiralled from there and this year I am completely transforming our back garden into a graveyard with tombstones and mummies.

'The funniest was last year when we had somebody hanging in a noose. We had him in a body harness but because it was dark it looked like he was hanging off nothing and just floating in the air. It scared the living daylights out of everybody.'

Mr Bird likes to take his ‘guests’ around the house himself so that no one can escape if they get scared of all the hanging spiders’ webs and creepy smoke that fills the rooms.

He said: 'I usually answer the door as a mummy and I take the kids - and the adults - around the house through the cobwebs and into the living room with a massive 7ft spider in. That normally causes a few screams.

'I was thinking of buying a chainsaw and taking the saw part off so it still makes the scary noise but it isn't dangerous, but I have decided to leave that until next year,' said Mr Bird (pictured above with Sav as Dracula)

In costume as a zombie, Mr Bird gets ready for another frightfest

'The next year, I added a coffin into the mix and this year I have got a full graveyard built by a local carpenter.

'We try to do something different each year just to mix it up a bit. This year, we’re going all out and decorating not only inside the house but also outside and the garden.

'I fill the dark hallway with smoke and I slowly walk through it as a mummy.

'I blast haunted music down the street and really make the whole thing a massive spectacle.

'We sometimes get people who come in and want to leave as soon as they set foot in the house because they are so scared about all the scary haunting sounds and the spiders’ webs.

'They don’t get to leave, though - I close the door behind them and make them walk through the house despite how scared they are.'

Mr Bird, his three girls - Abigail, 16, Ashley, 14, Shania, 12 - and his wife all get involved in the operation, which takes them three days to set up.

He said: 'I have always got to be doing something and Michelle gets involved with the dressing up along with me and the kids.

'Some of the neighbours come to help prepare the house and they also get dressed up in various spooky outfits.

'It takes us about three days to set the whole thing up, and then just a few hours to take it all down on Halloween night when we finish.'

'I was thinking of buying a chainsaw and taking the saw part off so it still makes the scary noise but it isn’t dangerous, but I have decided to leave that until next year.

'This year I have a zombie coming out the ground in the graveyard and a mummy coming out the coffin, so there will be plenty of scary things to see.

'I’ve decided that this year I’m going to dress up as something different.

'I’m thinking a zombie and I’ll get Thriller playing in the background at the beginning so that the neighbours know that the fun has begun.'
