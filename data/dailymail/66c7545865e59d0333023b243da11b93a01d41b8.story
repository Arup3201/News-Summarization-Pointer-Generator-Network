U.S. District Court Judge Esther Salas has sentenced Teresa Giudice to 15 months in federal prison and husband Joe Giudice to 41 months, while also ordering both to individually pay $414,588 in restitution.

The couple will also serve two years of probation upon being released, almost the maximum sentence that could have been handed down after they pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and three types of bankruptcy fraud earlier this year.

Teresa broke down in tears before her sentencing saying, 'I am more sorry than anyone will ever know,' adding to the judge, 'I will make this right.'

Avoiding the press: Teresa Giudice (above, with husband Joe leaving the courtroom) was sentenced to 15 months in federal prison by a judge today, and broke down in tears as she was sentenced 

Going away: Joe, who was sentenced to 41 months in federal prison and ordered to pay restitution of $414,588, gripped his wife's hand as they left the courthouse

Family: The Giudices have four daughters, Gia (above in purple), Gabriella (above in orange), Milania (above in blue) and Audriana (above in white)

Hiding: The two quickly rushed from the courtroom to their car after being sentenced

'I need to send a message. In the eyes of the law it doesn't matter who you are. There are consequences to pay,' the judge told Teresa as she handed out her sentence.  

'Confinement is absolutely necessary in this case,' Salas added, after admitting she did briefly consider probation for the reality star.

'I don’t honestly believe you respect the law.'

Teresa, 42, will report to prison on January 5, while Joe will report to prison after his wife serves her sentence so one of them can be with their four children while the other is away.

'She thumbed her nose at the court, now she wants sympathy,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan W. Romankow told the judge earlier in the day according to Jack Barbosa, who was in the courtroom.

Romankow then recommended she receive 21 months in prison for her crimes.

Joe, 43, also pleaded guilty to failing to file a tax return for 2004, though he acknowledged he didn't file taxes on income of approximately $1 million between 2004 and 2008. 

He will serve 12 months on that charge, but it will run concurrently with the 41 months he had already received for his other crimes. 

With good behavior, Teresa could be out in 12 months.

Paul Fishman, the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, said the sentencing was 'fair, appropriate and reasonable.'

No special treatment: The attorneys for both were unsuccessful in getting the judge to be lenient on the couple

The look: Her blouse was uncharacteristically conservative, but her eyelashes were their usual camera-ready selves

Under fire: Judge Esther Salas yelled at the couple early in the day for omissions in their financial disclosure forms

The judge said that immigration services will not act on Joe's deportation case until after he serves time.

Joe's attorneys have said that he came to the U.S. as an infant from Italy and wasn't aware that he wasn't an American citizen.

According to Radar Online, Joe's lawyers have told him he should start preparing to be deported to Italy after he serves time.   

The judge also recommended that he participate in an alcohol program, this after Joe's lawyer, Miles Feinstein, said Joe had a drinking problem and should be sent to rehab rather than prison.

Feinstein even told the judge that Joe shows up to his office 'smelling of booze.'

Joe also spent time in court trying to exonerate his wife from these charges, something his lawyer called 'the mark of a real man.' 

His lawyer then tried to place all blame on his client once his sentence had been handed down, and say Teresa should be kept out of jail for their girls, delaying her sentencing by hours.

Earlier, Judge Salas had yelled at the couple for failing to let the court know they purchased 'recreational vehicles, home furnishings, cars, construction equipment' and more over the past few months. 

'How is it that at this point the court is having to go over this?' Salas asked the couple's defense attorneys, according to The Record. 

The couple apparently had no answer for the judge, claiming they had hired an accountant and provided that person with their financial information.

The judge also pointed out the couple had previously hid assets from the court, forcing her to put off their sentencing. 

'It's the same pattern of obstruction and dishonesty and manipulation that they showed in the bankruptcy case,' the prosecutor told Judge Salas.  

The couple also said on forms they only own $25,000 worth of furniture in their $3 million home, saying the production company furnishes the house for them during filming.

The judge then asked why, if this was the case, they had a $1 million insurance policy. 

She also reminded the two that in 2009 bankruptcy filings, the couple showed $60,000 in assets in their home.

'They had an obligation to be transparent and candid and open with the court and I don't think I got that,' Judge Salas said according to NJ.com.

'I want to understand the disconnect.'

Teresa also listed her jewelry amount as 0, saying most is costume jewelry and not worth much. 

According to a reporter from the Star-Ledger in the courtroom, the judge then said that 'the pattern of omissions and inconsistencies does not make the couple seem worthy of leniency.'

Joe's lawyer blamed these recent actions on his client's difficulty dealing with the death of his father this past June.

'He hasn't been the same person,' Feinstein said. 

'That was his best friend.'

Joe read a letter to the court before he was sentenced, saying, 'I stand here humiliated before the court and my family and society.

I disgraced many people, including my wife and four daughters. I take full responsibility for my actions. I promise to be a better person.'

The couple took a plea deal in March, admitting that they hid assets from bankruptcy creditors and submitted phony loan applications to get some $5 million in mortgages and construction loans.

The couple also got some bad news earlier this week when a bankruptcy judge denied their claim to erase over $13 million in debt.

The couple arrived for the 10 am hearing at little after 9 this morning, Teresa dressing very conservatively in a black suit and yellow oxford shirt.   

Recent actions: Joe's lawyer blamed his client's financial omissions on his emotional state after losing his father (seen above with Joe's oldest daughter Gia)

Reality star: Teresa has been featured on all six seasons of Real Housewives of New Jersey

The good news however is that the couple's daughters, Gia, Gabriella, Milania and Audriana,will not be without a parent as each serves their time.

'My four daughters are my life. I don't care about the TV show,' Teresa had told the judge in court today.

Neither Teresa, Joe or their attorneys have commented yet on today's events. 

A spokeswoman for NBCUniversal, which owns Bravo, the channel that airs Real Housewives, said that the network wasn't commenting on the Giudices' position with the show.
