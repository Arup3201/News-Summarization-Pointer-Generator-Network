The 'Downton Effect' has sparked a revival of more formal dinner parties as Britons try to bring back fine dining.

The ITV period drama is encouraging hosts to go back to old rules and traditions at the table, a new guide suggests.

In Downton Abbey, the fictional Crawley 
family are regularly seen at grand dinner functions featuring countless 
courses and multiple wine glasses.

Downton Abbey is encouraging hosts to go back to old rules and traditions at the table, according to a new etiquette guide

Its influence could mark a move away from recent more casual dining habits, including snacking, sharing platters and takeaways.

The trend has prompted electrical giant Samsung to team up with etiquette experts Debrett's to produce a posh guide to dining.

It includes some rules and regulations that may come as a shock to those who like to throw together a casual, dress-down dinner party at the last minute.

Dinner party hosts are reminded that places should be set 20 inches apart, a host sits with the 'leading female guest' to his right and the hostess with the 'leading male guest' to her right.

One should speak equally to those sitting on either side of them, which means switching from a guest on one side to the guest on the other in between courses.

The guide also includes wine tips, including referring to red Bordeaux as claret, serving white wine chilled and always keep glasses filled so guests are not tempted to help themselves.

Perhaps surprisingly, hosts are told not to make allowances for guests on diets - if they are watching the calories they can simply eat less, said Debrett's.

A spokesperson for Samsung, said: 'More people are choosing to entertain friends and family at home and re-create dishes, inspired by celebrity chefs and cooking programmes.'

A Debrett's etiquette advisor added: 'A well-organised host will plan every detail of a dinner party carefully, from the guest list and table arrangements to the menu and timings.

'Being a good host is hard work - it is about being aware of all of the guests all of the time, ensuring that they are well looked after and having a wonderful time.'
