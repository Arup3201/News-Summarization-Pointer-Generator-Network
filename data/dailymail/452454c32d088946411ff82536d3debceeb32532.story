Taking over: Carole Middleton is to fill in while William and Kate find new household staff

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge can finally breathe a sigh of relief after finding new housekeepers to run their Norfolk estate – Kate’s mum and dad.

Last month I revealed that William and Kate had lost the services of Amy and Colin Wood, their valuable husband-and-wife team. 

Now I understand that Carole and Michael Middleton are personally filling the void while they help Kate look for some new hired help to maintain elegant Anmer Hall.

Though Carole has stopped short of scrubbing floors, she is said to be organising every detail of running the household from her own quarters in an annexe of the 100-room Georgian manor. 

Kate’s father Michael is thought to be overseeing the gardening, and has been involved in making arrangements to clear a mole infestation which has ruined a pretty lawn overlooking the Sandringham estate.

It is believed that Carole, 60, and her 65-year-old husband have now committed themselves to staying in Norfolk until Kate’s second child arrives next month.

Mr and Mrs Wood started working for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in September last year when restoration work was being completed on the Georgian mansion. 

The property was given to the Royal couple by the Queen after they got married. 

The Woods lived at the site with their five-year-old son, with Mrs Wood looking after the ten-bedroom property and her husband in charge of landscaping and the garden.  

The couple had previously been trusted employees at the Sandringham estate and it is thought they will return to work there after five months with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their son, Prince George. 

Sources say that Kate, who has endured another difficult pregnancy, has been ‘tetchy’ and can only be truly placated by her mother – one of the many reasons why William is happily encouraging the arrangement. 

Mrs Middleton has previously been said to be a frequent visitor to Anmer Hall.  

But news of the Middletons’ involvement in running the Cambridge family home comes at a time when reports suggest that Prince Charles is growing anxious about how little he sees his grandchild. 

A family friend tells me: ‘When George arrived, Kate and William moved into Kate’s parents’ house. This time the Middletons are moving in to Anmer with William and Kate. 

There is plenty of space and Kate really wants her mother around. At the moment Carole is getting everything in place because the baby is due around April 25.’

The couple have been left in the lurch since Amy and Colin Wood, their valuable husband-and-wife team, quit last month

The Middletons were the first to meet Prince George after his birth in 2013 – ahead of Charles and his wife Camilla – and it seems they are set to be favourites when it comes to getting access to George’s brother or sister too. 

Another source added: ‘William is very happy to sit back and let Carole take up the reins. She is ensuring that Anmer runs like clockwork. The nursery and staff will be an oasis of calm and evenings will be sacrosanct for relaxation, sleep and recovery.’

The Middletons spent Christmas at Anmer Hall - with the Duke and Duchess flouting royal tradition by being absent from the normal get together at the Queen's lunch at Sandringham. 

There have also been rumours that the Middletons are considering buying a house in Norfolk to be close to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their young family. This could be a great help for the Duchess because William will be starting his new job as a helicopter pilot with East Anglian Air Ambulance in the summer.

The family home in Bucklebury is a frequent bolthole for Kate, who also retreated there for a week in October last year as she again struggled with the extreme morning sickness that marked her first pregnancy.

Despite the presence of Spanish nanny Maria Borallo, Mrs Middleton was seen taking Prince George off her daughter's hands as he dealt with her morning sickness. She is said to prefer being there than Kensington Palace because she can retreat from the public eye.  

Officials were forced to announce the Duchess of Cambridge's pregnancy in September, which was earlier than planned,  because her acute morning sickness meant she was forced to cancel a number of public engagements.

The Duchess was hospitalised with hyperemesis gravidarum and severe dehydration during her first pregnancy with Prince George. But doctors have been better prepared this time and it has been suggested she may even have been treated with a drip at home. 

Might we be seeing a bit more of Hollywood actress Uma Thurman in London?

I gather that the Kill Bill actress, has rekindled her romance with Chiltern Firehouse founder Andre Balazs five years after they split up. 

The 44-year-old actress first dated the millionaire hotelier in 2007 following her divorce from actor Ethan Hawke. 

Their affair later fizzled out and in 2010 she met multi-millionaire financier Arki Busson, 52, and the couple went on to have daughter, Luna, now aged two.

After their breakup last April, I hear Andre, 58, is back on the scene.

The Kill Bill actress is rumoured to have rekindled her romance with Chiltern Firehouse founder Andrew Balazs
