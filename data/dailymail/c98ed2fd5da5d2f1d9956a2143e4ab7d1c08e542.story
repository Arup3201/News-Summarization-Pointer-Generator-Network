Eleven parents of some of the 276 Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped by Islamist extremists have died since the mass abduction without knowing their daughters' fate.

Seven fathers were among 51 bodies brought back to their hometown of Chibok earlier this month after an attack by Boko Haram in the nearby village of Kautakari.

At least four more parents have died of heart failure, high blood pressure and other illnesses which residents blame on the trauma caused by the kidnapping three months ago.

Loss: 11 of the parents  have died since the 276 Nigerian schoolgirls were abducted by terror group Boko Haram three months ago

Community leader Pogu Bitrus said: One father of two of the girls kidnapped just went into a kind of coma and kept repeating the names of his daughters, until life left him.'

Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan is meeting with many other parents of the schoolgirls today, as well as some classmates who managed to escape.

For months the parents have been asking to see the president and he finally agreed last week to a request from Pakistani girls-education activist Malala Yousafzai. 

Around 57 students managed to flee shortly after they were captured, but a committee investigating their disappearance said 219 of the girls are still missing. 

According to a mediator working with Boko Haram two of the girls have died of snake bites while around 20 have fallen ill. 

Residents have warned that there is a famine looming in Chibok because food stocks are being depleted by the growing population.

Four or five families are having to share small houses because nearby villagers who survive  assaults are swarming into the town. 

Family: Martha Mark, the mother of kidnapped school girl Monica Mark cries as she displays her photo. It is not known whether Martha was among those who died

Bitrus added: 'There are families that are putting up four and five other families. Livestock has been looted by Boko Haram so villagers are arriving empty handed. Worst of all, no one is planting though it is the rainy season.'

Every village in the neighboring Damboa area has been attacked and ransacked, along with all the villages bordering Cameroon. The attacks continue despite the fact the military placed the area under a state of emergency in May 2013. 

They are also struggling to get supplies in because the town has been cut off by frequent attacks that have left the roads filled with burned out cars.

Commercial flights into the area have also been stopped and the government has halted charter flights. 

Demands: The leader of Boko Haram, Abubakar Sheku, repeated in a video this week that he would exchange the abducted girls for detained extremists 

The number of soldiers guarding Chibok has increased from 15 to around 200 since the kidnapping but they have done little to increase security.

They often refuse to deploy to villages under attack even though there is advance warning 90 per cent of the time.    

Most of the schoolgirls are still believed to be held in the Sambisa Forest — a wildlife reserve that includes a mixture of thick jungle and open savannah.

The forest borders on sand dunes marking the edge of the Sahara Desert. Sightings of the girls and their captors have been reported in neighboring Cameroon and Chad.  

Chibok and nearby villages are targets because they are enclaves of staunch Christians in predominantly Muslim north Nigeria.

Residents feel so abandoned that they appealed this month for the United Nations to send troops to protect them. 

The U.N. has repeatedly urged Nigeria's government to live up to its international responsibility to protect citizens.

President Goodluck Jonathan insists his government and military are doing everything possible to ensure the girls' release. The Defense Ministry says it knows where they are but fears any military campaign could lead to their deaths.

Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau in a new video released this week repeated his demands that Jonathan release detained extremists in exchange for the girls — an offer Jonathan has so far refused.

After three months, few Chibok residents believe all the schoolgirls will ever return home.
