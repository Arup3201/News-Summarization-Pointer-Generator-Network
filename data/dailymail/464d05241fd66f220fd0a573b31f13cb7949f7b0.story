Tears: Kathleen Thompson gave evidence on the fourth day of fresh inquests in Warrington

The wife of a train guard who died in the Hillsborough disaster made a tearful plea to jurors last night to ‘let my children know their father was not a hooligan’.

Kathleen Thompson was left as sole carer of three sons and two daughters when her husband Pat was crushed to death at the football ground in April 1989.

Yesterday she broke down as she revealed only her two eldest children, Patrick and Sean, have any memories of their father.

The boys were five and four respectively and the couple also had two-year-old Katie and twins Rebecca and Brendan, nine months old at the time.

She said she wanted them to know her husband, who died aged 35, was a devoted family man.

Mrs Thompson, 57, was giving evidence on the fourth day of fresh inquests into the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans at the FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest.

She and relatives of other victims hope the court will eliminate once and for all any suggestion that fans’ behaviour played a part in the disaster.

Mrs Thompson told the jury: ‘Hillsborough robbed the children of their father, a man so proud to have been at the birth of each of them.

'The thing that hurts the most is that the children have limited memories of their father.’

She said they had grown up listening to ‘constant’ stories about Mr Thompson from other family members.

‘Even now my children love their dad so much,’ she said. ‘All they want is justice for their father.

‘Please listen to the evidence and let my children know that their dad was not a hooligan but a hard-working family man who just happened to love football.’

The hearing in Warrington heard the 
first of a series of short biographies or ‘pen portraits’ by the loved 
ones of those lost in the disaster, reducing some jurors to tears.

Wilf
 Whelan, 71, father of 19-year-old Ian Whelan, told the court that on 
the ‘fateful’ morning of the tragedy his eldest son, who worked as a 
clerk for British Nuclear Fuels, had called at his girlfriend Joanne’s 
home and left two red roses on her doorstep as a surprise.

Horror: The disaster left 96 football fans dead and several hundred injured - but they were initially blamed

‘He wasn’t a football hooligan,’ Mr Whelan said. ‘He even attended Mass of his own free will every Sunday without fail.

'My family feel that they have had to defend his good name for the last 25 years.’

The older brother of victim Paula Smith, 26, revealed they were only able to get one ticket for the match, so he gave it to her and went to work instead.

Walter Smith added: ‘I often think if I’d been there with her she would be here today. … my mother never got over Paula’s death, she was heartbroken, as was my father.’

The inquests, which began on Monday, were ordered after the 1991 inquests’ verdicts of ‘accidental death’ were quashed following publication of the Hillsborough Independent Panel’s inquiry in December 2012.

Aftermath: One father said he had to spend 25 difficult years defending his son's good name
