A British millionaire accused of sexually assaulting a woman on Bondi Beach told her that a prosecution against him would ‘go nowhere’ because he was rich, a court heard yesterday.

Gregory Charles Cox, who founded his own financial services firm, is accused of having sex with a 21-year-old tourist without consent.

The 32-year-old was said to have held the ‘terrified’ woman her on her knees so she could perform a sex act on him after they met at a bar on the Sydney beach.

She later claimed Cox had said: ‘You 
can tell the police, you can tell whoever you like but this will never 
go anywhere – I’ve got a lot of money.’

In his opening address to the jury, 
prosecutor Huw Baker said Cox met the holidaymaker, from Bermuda, at a 
beach-side bar but she had initially been interested in his friend.

Although heavy drinking had given her
 a ‘patchy memory’, she left the bar with the tycoon and headed along 
the beach, said Mr Baker.

‘She recalls being on her knees and 
she tried to stand up but being unable to stand up because something was
 holding her down,’ he said. ‘She recalls being terrified at that 
point.’

Cox is then said to have forced her to perform a sex act on him.

Afterwards she cried and hit Cox on the thighs as she told him: ‘Please stop, please stop – I don’t want this.’

Mr Baker said: ‘She was trying to get up but felt the accused’s hand on the back of her head.’

Her cries for help were later heard 
by a young couple and she was taken to a police station, where officers 
described her as being ‘distressed, shivering and crying’.

Police were also said to have heard her say: ‘He told me over and over again that he had a lot of money.’

Cox, who founded the Manchester-based
 Quintessential Finance Group, was also on holiday in Australia when the
 alleged attack took place in January last year.

He had been staying in a luxury beach-side apartment in the suburb of Bronte, a few miles from Bondi.

The businessman, who lists Peaches 
Geldof among his Facebook friends, was arrested four days after the 
alleged incident when he returned to the bar and was spotted by staff 
who had been supplied with his description by police.

Graeme Turnbull, defending, told the 
Sydney court that the woman’s conduct ‘was entirely consistent with a 
willing participant’.

The jury heard that Cox had told friends the woman ‘freaked out’ after the sex act, threw her handbag in the air and ran off.

As she left her belongings on the 
beach, said Mr Turnbull, Cox had handed them in to a city centre police 
station, where he gave his own details.

Mr Turnbull also said that his client had gone back to the Bondi beach bar to ask if anyone knew the woman.

‘If he is a rapist, is that consistent?’ he asked the court. 

Cox denies two charges of  sex without consent. The trial continues.
