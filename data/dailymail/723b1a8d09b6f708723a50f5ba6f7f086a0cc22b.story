A fisherman told last night about the one that got away – a suspected Russian submarine which became entangled in his nets after it strayed inside British waters in the North Sea.

Angus Macleod, 46, was fishing for haddock and skate when he became convinced that a hostile vessel was caught up below his boat Aquarius.

The submarine attempted to free itself, taking the 65ft vessel and his two-ton catch with it.

Angus MacLeod (pictured) a fishing boat skipper, has lodged an incident report with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and the Marine Accident Investigation Branch following the unusual occurence

Mr Macleod, whose account is being examined by the Marine Accident Investigation Board, said: ‘Suddenly a force beneath our boat dragged the nets from behind us to in front of us. It was very powerful because the nets were full of fish and very heavy.

‘The submarine was then ahead of Aquarius and heading on a northerly bearing towards international waters and bringing our nets along behind it. Only a submarine could have done this – it was a clear, still night and there were no other boats around.

‘Had the submarine headed for deeper waters we might have sunk with it, but I don’t want to dwell on that.

'We were eventually cut loose when the 150ft-long dog rope, which attaches the nets to the ship, wrapped itself around Aquarius’s propeller and got ripped apart. We were then able to sail back to port.’

Mr MacLeod says he suffered around £10,000 in damage and loss of earning due to the damage to his boat

Mr McLeod said following the incident: 'I've been at sea for 30 years - and between the five of us there is 110 years experience - and in our collective times we have never experienced anything like that'

Mr Macleod, a fisherman for 30 years, never saw the submarine but is convinced that such a vessel caused the incident. 

It follows an upsurge in covert operations by the Russian navy in the waters surrounding the British Isles and patrols on the periphery of UK airspace by Russian aircraft. 

He added he was told by the coastguard that there was no Nato submarine activity in the area where the incident took place.

The Ministry of Defence said it did not comment on submarine operations, while Foreign Office sources suggested they would consider the outcome of an MAIB investigation before making any approach to the Russian Embassy.

The incident caused damage worth £10,000 and lost fishing time. Mr Macleod added: ‘If you give me the address, then I’ll send the bill to Moscow.’
