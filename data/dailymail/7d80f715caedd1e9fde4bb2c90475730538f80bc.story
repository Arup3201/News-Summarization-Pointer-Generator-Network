Israel have promised not to kick Gareth Bale off the pitch during their vital Euro 2016 qualifier against Wales.

Manager Eli Guttman said his team would instead work as a unit to limit space for the Real Madrid star.

Cyprus took chunks out of Bale during October’s Group B game, and he is in the top 10 of most fouled players in qualification with 12.

But Gutman said: ‘We don’t have enough strong players to kick him out. We are going to play as a team, one unit, not to give space. We have to put the players close together on the pitch.’

Bale’s Real team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo failed to score against Israel in two games during qualification for last year’s World Cup, with Maccabi Tel Aviv midfielder Sheran Yeini shackling the Portugal star.

But Guttman responded with sarcasm when asked if the trick could be repeated.

‘We called Cristiano to ask how to do the same against Bale but he did not answer, unfortunately,’ he laughed.

Wales manager Chris Coleman said Bale would cope even if Israel resorted to the rough stuff. ‘He has played most of his football in the Premier League, the most physically demanding in the world,’ said Coleman.

‘He has come through Madrid derbies and Clasicos in Spain. All the focus will be on him but we have a good squad and our strength is our togetherness.’

Bale is set to be handed a free role tonight, after fierce criticism of his form by media and supporters in Madrid.

Coleman insisted there had been no mention from Bale of Madrid during the week’s training, however, and his best player was unaffected by the furore.

‘I cannot see any difference in him,’ said Coleman. ‘If I thought it was bothering him, we would have talked about it. We have not mentioned Real Madrid, we have only talked about Wales and this game. He is happy, relaxed and, most importantly, fit.’
