Mr Gao's own car, a white Nissan Sylvia sedan, was found abandoned in Padstow on the afternoon of his disappearance.

His mobile phone, keys and wallet were also found nearby.

Mr Gao's mother, who runs a small business, was overseas on holiday at the time of the abduction but has since returned to Australia.

His family have been offered police protection but Det Supt Moore said there was no evidence of  threat.

Andy Zephyr, the student association president at the University of Technology where Mr Gao studied, didn't want to speculate on the circumstances surrounding his death but was shocked by his alleged drug involvement.

'There were already a lot of rumours,' he said.

'It is a shock … For those [at the university] that know him, it would be a shock.'

Mr Zephyr said anyone upset about the incident would be offered counselling as part of the university's duty of care to students.

Mr Gao is described as being of Asian appearance, approximately 170 to 175cm tall, of medium build, with black hair and brown eyes.

Disgraced former policeman Rogerson won 13 bravery awards in the 1980s and was praised for his 'devotion to duty'.

But he was convicted of perverting the course of justice in relation to $110,000 he deposited in bank accounts under a false name and was dismissed from the police force in 1986.

McNamara released a book called Dirty Work in 2010 about his time as a Kings Cross policeman and his 'fight for justice' in a 'sea of corruption and money making'.
