Lost in translation: A Swedish women's group launched a campaign to find a word for female masturbation

In Sweden there is no commonly accepted word for female masturbation, so the country's sex education group has launched a competition to establish one.

The Swedish Association for Sexuality Education (RFSU) – an organisation that promotes an 'open, positive view of sex and relationship issues' – has so far received more than a thousand suggestions after launching the contest earlier this month.

Top suggestions so far include 'Klittra', 'pulla' and 'selfa'.

Kristina Ljungros, a spokeswoman for the association, hopes the competition will encourage healthy discussions about sexuality.

She told The Local: 'Rather than sit around amongst ourselves talking about it, we thought we would launch a nationwide competition.

'We are trying to put sexuality on the agenda - the positive aspects, not just the negative ones like sexual abuse. We want to focus on the good parts, the lust'.

'When it comes to masturbation, people mostly think about just men doing it and we don't think of it as common for women. If we don't have a word in the language, how can we even talk about it?'

The contest follows news that researchers have discovered that although many women assume they know exactly what turns them on, their brains and their lady bits often disagree.

Scientists at Indiana University's Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction, used a 'vaginal photoplethysmograph'- a small glass tampon-shaped instrument that measures sexual arousal by blood flow - to demonstrate this mind-body disconnect.

Writer Melanie Berliet, 33, based in New York City, underwent the test herself and discovered some surprising discrepancies between what she believed she found sexy, and what her nether regions responded to.

'I've always thought of myself as self-aware sexually,' Miss Berliet writes for Cosmopolitan.

'I consider myself a non-judgmental heterosexual woman who enjoys various positions and toys and is open to the possibility of a threesome if the urge strikes.' 

In the interests of the experiment, Miss Berliet was required to insert the probe into her vagina and seat herself on a leather chair while various erotic and non-erotic video clips were played before her. 

Erick Janssen, PhD - whose work in sexual pleasure has reportedly earned him the monkier Dr. Feel Good - and evolutionary biologist Justin R. Garcia, PhD, both leading the study, were controlling the videos from a separate room. 

Campaign: The most popular suggestions submitted have been 'Klittra', 'pulla' and 'selfa'

'The probe looked and felt like a glass tampon, so it was easy to forget that it was inside me,' Miss Berliet tells MailOnline. 

The device, she explains, measures blood flow to the surrounding tissue, or the 'pulse' of the vagina, which indicates arousal. 

'It was definitely a challenge to stay still, but overall I was comfortable. Since I was focused on watching porn, any discomfort I might have felt was probably eclipsed by the graphic imagery inches from my face.' 

As Dr Janssen explains, arousal is made up from a balance between two brain systems; sexual excitation, 'your gas pedal', and sexual inhibition, 'your breaks'. 

Miss Berliet was exposed to wide range of visual stimuli; from 'neutralizing' kitten videos and scenes from uplifting films, to hard-core porn and a disturbing clip from The Silence of the Lambs. 

For each video, she was asked to rate her emotional responses - excitement, relaxation, fright, sadness, guilt and shame, for example - on a five-point scale. 

Miss Berliet then told researchers, off the top of her head, that she was generally aroused by concepts including lesbian sex, a threesome and female masturbation. 

She also declared some concepts that she didn't consider arousing; homosexual male sex, foot fetishism and bonobo monkeys mating, for example. 

After sourcing video clips relevant to Miss Berliet's preferences, she was invited to view them and rate how aroused each clip made her feel on a scale of one to ten. This created some mental conflicts. 

'As a proponent of gay rights, for instance, I wanted to be turned on by sex between men, but I found the sight of two erect penises off-putting. 'And as much as I wanted to believe that neither animals nor feet could excite me, I had to concede a minimal level of attraction to both.'
