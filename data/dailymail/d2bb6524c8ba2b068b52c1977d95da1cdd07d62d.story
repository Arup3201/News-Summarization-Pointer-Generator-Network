The parents of a trainee teacher who killed himself because he had been bullied for years over his sexuality have published their son's suicide note in a local newspaper.

Tim Ribberink, who was training to become a history teacher, killed himself last Thursday following years of bullying.

But the decision by his parents Gerrit and Hetty Ribberink to publish their son's suicide note  has divided opinion in the Netherlands.

Bold: The parents of trainee teacher Tim Ribberink, who killed himself because he had been bullied over his sexuality, have published this death notice together with their son's suicide note in a local newspaper

In the newspaper, the suicide note is published along with Tim's death notice and a large smiling picture of him.

It reads: 'Dear Mum and Dad, All my life I have been ridiculed, abused, bullied and excluded. You guys are fantastic. I hope you’re not angry. Until we meet again, Tim.'

His devastated parents, from Tilligte, east of Amsterdam, said they were not aware that there son was struggling to cope until he killed himself last Thursday.

According to Irish Times.com, his parents have now asked police to investigate his death and in particular, to look at two fake messages which were posted in his name online.

One of the messages dates back to 2010 with the second appearing last summer. It read: 'I am a loser and a homo'.

The parents are now hoping the police will be able to identify the bullies by investigating the fake messages.

The decision by Tim's parents to publish the suicide note led to a massive reaction on Twitter.

Despite some negative comments, the majority of posts supported the parents' decision to publish the note. Many called for tougher laws to deal with bulling.

Within hours of the story about Tim's death emerging, his photograph was shared more than 5,000 times. The Twitter hashtag #timribberink has also been trending in the Netherlands.

Last night, an emotional funeral took place at the Catholic church in Tilligte.

Emotional: Pastor Marinus van de Berg read out a statement from Tim's parents, which said that people being bullied should never give up

Hundreds of friends and family attended, with many still shocked and angry about his death.

A message from his parents was read to the congratulation from local pastor Marinus Van den Berg, which read: 'Tim was not weak or pathetic. He was strong. That is how we knew him, and that is how he would want the world to remember him.'

They also quote Winston Churchill by telling other people who are being bullied to never give up.

Tim's teacher training college in Windesheim and his former secondary school both said they did not know Tim was being bullied.
