The daughter of a National Hockey League player may have got the most important acquisition of the day before the league's trade deadline this afternoon thanks to a letter she wrote in January.

Jordan Leopold's daughter Jordyn, 11, wrote a letter to the Minnesota Wild asking the team to acquire her father from the Columbus Blue Jackets in Ohio.

The team unknowingly obliged her request 20 minutes before the trade deadline and got Leopold, a native of Golden Valley, Minnesota, sent back to his home state.

The team obliged and got Leoopold, 34, in exchange for defenseman Justin Falkand and a fifth-round pick

Leopold, a native of Golden Valley, Minnesota, went to the University of Minnesota and he won a NCAA title 

In exchange for Leopold, 34, the Wild surrendered defenseman Justin Falkand and a fifth-round pick in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft.

Wild general manager Chuck Fletcher  had no idea about the letter, which was addressed to the 'Minnesota Wild Coaches', before he made the deal, according to The Star. 

Jordyn wrote the letter in January when the Wild were in the middle of a bad losing streak, KFAN reported. 

In the letter, Jordyn identifies herself and her father before getting to her pitch.

The letter reads: 'Well, my dad is very lonely without his family.

'We are living in Minnesota right now and I am lost without my dad and so is my mom, my 2 sisters and my brother.

'It has been since November and we can not take it any more.

'To get to the point, the Wild have not been winning games and you lovely coaches are most likely mad about that but your team needs some more D men so can you please, please, please ask the Jackets if you guys can get him?!'

Blue Jackets general manager Jarmo Kekalainen may have been aware of Jordyn's plight before the swap.

He tweeted: 'It isn't always just about business…'

After the deal was made, Fletcher of the Wild certainly found out about Jordyn's note because #TheLetter began trending on Twitter.

He said the letter was 'tremendous' and 'very powerful'.

Leopold has scored 67 goals and tallied 146 NHL assists. He  played for the US in the 2006 Winter Olympics
