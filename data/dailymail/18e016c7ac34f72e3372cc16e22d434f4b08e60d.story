President George H.W. Bush has released a series of letters and e-mails spanning the last decade that reveal a deep resentment toward the media over what he believed were unfair attacks against his son. 

'I am really down about the way the President has been attacked,' Bush wrote in a 2005 letter to journalist and long-time friend Hugh Sidey about the criticism against the government's response to Hurricane Katrina. 'Over and over again the networks attack him. First for being late in moving. Then for over flying Louisiana on the way back to Washington. Then on the snail like pace of relief.'

Defending his son, Bush wrote, 'My heart went out to him. Here is a guy who cares deeply. Who wants every possible resource of the Federal Government brought in to bear to help people, yet he is being roundly accused of not giving a damn... the critics do not know what is in 43's heart, how deeply he feels about the hurt, the anguish, the losses affecting so many people, most of them poor.'

Resentment: President George H.W. Bush has released a series of letters and e-mails spanning the last decade that reveal a deep resentment toward the media over what he believed were unfair attacks against his son

He compared the media attacks on George W. Bush to when he was a Navy pilot and the Japanese shot down his plane 61 years earlier.

'Now I see some of his most nasty critics trying to shoot down my beloved son - shoot him down by mean spirited attacks,' Bush wrote. 'I was a scared kid back then. Now I am just an angry old man hurting for my son.'

The newly released letters are included in an updated version of the book, 'All the Best, George Bush; My Life in Letters and Other Writings.' The book, which was originally published in 1999, was re-released on Tuesday.

In another letter, the elder Bush recalled his pride when his son won the Republican presidential nomination in 2000. He said he felt a chapter in his life had been closed and that he could finally pull out of the political limelight.

'I felt that finally my political days were over – the record sealed and finished, with the historians left to decide,' he wrote in a letter to former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. 'The baton had indeed been passed; and when Bar ]Barbara] and I left the hall, proudest parents in the world, we felt that a wonderful chapter was closed, finished!'

When the Florida recount of votes was finally finished and Bush had been declared the winner, the elder Bush wrote in a letter to Sidey, 'The fat lady sang. The ordeal ended.'

After his son's acceptance speech, he recalled talking to him over the phone that night. 

'What did you think Dad?' the newly elected president asked his father of the speech. 'I told him how perfect I felt his speech was. I also told him I had lost it,' the elder Bush wrote. 

After his son was sworn into office, Bush said he was overcome with emotion.

'Our son was President of the United States of America,' Bush wrote. 'It was for real. Our pride knew no bounds. We managed to contain our emotions but they shook us to the core. Wonder. Joy. Amazement. Honor. Happiness. I don't know how to describe what I felt, but it was good, real good.'

He added: 'I am not sure if there was one specific moment in time when I finally realized that my son was President. If I had to single out one such moment it would be right after the oath taking.'

Not long after Bush won the presidency, the nation suffered the worst terrorist attack in history on September 11, 2001.

Shortly after the attacks George H.W. Bush talked to his son, who was in Florida at the time.

'I talked to George,' Bush wrote in a letter to Sidey. 'I did tell him the sooner he got back to Washington the better. He totally agreed with that.'

Going forward, the elder Bush said he tried to stay out of his son's affairs.

After George W. Bush won the Republican nomination in 2000, his father wrote:

'I felt that finally my political days 
were over – the record sealed and finished, with the historians left to 
decide... The baton had indeed been passed.'

When George W. Bush was criticized for his handling of the recovery efforts after Hurricane Katrina, his father wrote:

'Now I see some of his most nasty 
critics trying to shoot down my beloved son - shoot him down by mean 
spirited attacks... I was a scared kid back then. Now I am 
just an angry old man hurting for my son.'

After his son was sworn into office, Bush Sr. wrote:

'Our
son was President of the United States of America... It was
for real. Our pride knew no bounds. We managed to contain our emotions 
but they shook us to the core. Wonder. Joy. Amazement. Honor. Happiness.
I don't know how to describe what I felt, but it was good, real good.'

When his son won re-election, the 
elder Bush recalled going over to the White House and sitting with the president-elect in the Oval Office:

'The two of us sat alone in that historic office,' he wrote. 'For me it was magic.'

'George
W. said to me, "Dad, do you realize that this is the first time since 
1988 that a President has won with a clear majority of the vote?"' the 
elder Bush recalled. 'My mind raced back to my win over [Democratic 
nominee Michael] Dukakis in 1988. Who would have thought back then that I
would be bonding with my own son in that manner?'

'It is not easy, dear friend, to sit on the sidelines now, not easy to make decisions or take actions,' Bush wrote to Sidey. 'But I must continue to stay out of the limelight, out of the news, giving quiet support to #43.'

Not all of Bush's newly released exchanges were political in nature. Bush's sense of humor also shone through in exchanges with his granddaughters and with President Bill Clinton.

In March of 2003, he wrote in an email to his granddaughters, Jenna, Barbara and Lauren, 'It is Sunday morning. I am at my duty station in the office. I am worrying about three of my older granddaughters. Spring Break causes the worry. I wonder - are all three off somewhere trying to get on the Wild College Women TV show?'

'Are they having a good time? Are they sticking near their three campuses so they can do what, well, what I used to do during spring break back in the good old days, circa 1946-47-48. Namely, stick near the Library. I found it was almost free of noise and people during spring break. Maybe you three have discovered the same thing.

'I am here all week in Houston in case 
you need adult leadership. In spite of these worries, maybe because of 
these worries, I love all three of you "guys" (who says the Gampster 
can't be "with it"?)'

Humor: In a letter to President Clinton (second from right) George H.W. Bush (far left) teased him for falling asleep during a sermon

Several years later in a letter to President Clinton, Bush joked about catching the former president dozing off during a sermon. 

'My heart went out to you when I saw you trying to keep your eyes open during an MLK Day sermon,' Bush wrote in 2008. 'I could indeed "feel your pain." I have been there myself, more than once I might add, and it physically hurt as I tried to keep my eyes open. I don't remember if I ever told you about the prestigious Scowcroft Award, given during my White House days to the person that fell most soundly asleep during a meeting. Points were added for "recovery."'

'A standard recovery,' he added, was to 'awake from a sound sleep, and start by nodding one's head in agreement to something just said in the meeting, something you had not heard at all.'

Extra points were awarded for 'writing something on a pad, anything at all.'

'I remember when [Dick] Cheney won the award one time,' he wrote. 'We presented it to him at a nice dinner in the Rose Garden. Modest fellow that he is, he proclaimed himself unworthy, though his solid sleep in the Cabinet meeting had been witnessed by all assembled.'

When his son won re-election, the elder Bush recalled going over to the White House and sitting with the president-elect in the Oval Office. 

'The two of us sat alone in that historic office,' he wrote to Sidey. 'For me it was magic.'

'George W. said to me, "Dad, do you realize that this is the first time since 1988 that a President has won with a clear majority of the vote?"' the elder Bush recalled. 'My mind raced back to my win over [Democratic nominee Michael] Dukakis in 1988. Who would have thought back then that I would be bonding with my own son in that manner?'

'Victory,' he wrote. 'How sweet it is.'
