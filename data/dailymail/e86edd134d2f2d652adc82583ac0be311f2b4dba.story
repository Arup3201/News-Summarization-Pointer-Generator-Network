The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are to shun royal tradition and choose close school and university friends to be Prince George’s godparents, it has been reported.

The couple are said to be planning to ask friends out of the public eye to give their son a sense of normality as he grows up.

Financier Fergus Boyd, who went to Eton with Prince William and shared a house with the couple at St Andrew’s University, will be one of George’s six godparents, it was claimed.

Kate’s school friend from Marlborough 
College, interior designer Emilia d’Erlanger, is also a contender, as is
one of William’s oldest friends Hugh van Cutsem.

William is godfather to Mr Van Cutsem’s daughter Grace, who was a flower girl at the royal wedding.

A
royal source said: ‘They are rather unexpected off-the-wall choices for
godparents – not the usual suspects of William’s closest friends who we
anticipated.’

The contenders are a world away from the godparents chosen for William, most of whom had royal connections.

They included Constantine II, the former King of Greece, and Princess Alexandra, a cousin of the  Queen.

The Duchess of Westminster, who was the youngest at 23, was said to be Diana's sole choice for godparent.

Bookmakers last night slashed the odds for Mr Boyd to become a godparent from 8/1 to 1/2, making him the favourite.

Ladbrokes said Mrs d’Erlanger was now second favourite at 4/6, while Mr Van Cutsem was third favourite at 1/1.

Prince George’s uncle and aunt, Prince Harry and Pippa Middleton, are also in the running at 4/1.

It is another sign that the pair is determined to raise their son in their own way.

They
have already deviated from tradition by choosing to hold his 
christening at the intimate Chapel Royal in St James's Palace, rather 
than Buckingham Palace's music room.

Mr Boyd knew William at Eton and shared the same hall of residence as the couple during their first year of university.

The trio shared a farmhouse together in their second year, and Mr Boyd, 31, witnessed William and Kate's friendship blossom into something more.

At a charity fashion show in 2002, as the duchess strutted down the catwalk in a sheer lace dress, William is said to have turned to Mr Boyd and said, 'Wow, Kate's hot'.

Ms d'Erlanger introduced Kate to William's circles and remained close to both of them during their split in 2007.

Married to David Jardine-Paterson, a friend of William's from Eton, she is reportedly advising Kate on the renovation of their Kensington Palace apartment.

The couple have already broken with tradition by releasing this intimate picture by Kate's father as the first official portrait of Prince George and will hold the christening at Chapel Royal in St James's Palace

Meanwhile, Mr van Cutsem, 39, is one 
of William's oldest friends and his late father, also called Hugh, was 
close to Prince Charles.

William
was an usher at his wedding in 2005 to Rose Astor.

Other likely candidates for the role include Prince William's best friend Thomas van Straubenzee, William's longest-serving adviser Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, and William and Harry's former nanny, Tiggy Pettifer, nee Legge-Bourke.

Nightclub owner Guy Pelly, a close friend of William's, has already ruled out a role at the christening, after it was reported he had been asked to be a godparent.

He said: 'People have been coming up to me and shaking my hand offering their congratulations. They have got it all wrong. I spoke to William about it and he confirmed I am not going to be one.'

It comes after the Mail revealed that some senior members of the Royal Family have not been invited to Prince George's christening on October 23 because his parents want it to be an 'intimate, family affair'.

Prince William's aunts, Princess Anne and Sophie, Countess of Wessex, are believed to be among those left off the guest list.

They recently moved into their new home at Kensington Palace following a £1.5million overhaul. 

But one Royal expert says there are spooky goings-on at family home that no amount of redecoration can remove. 

Royal biographer Andrew Morton says Prince George's nursery in Apartment 1A of Kensington Palace is 'notorious' for its ghostly sightings. 

He said apparitions of the prince's namesake, King George II, as well as Caroline of Brunswick and Princess Sophia, have all been seen. 

Mr Morton even said that Princess Margaret's housekeeper once reported seeing a woman in Regency dress before it disappeared into a wall. 

Mr Morton told The Sun: 'Let's hope little Prince George can sleep peacefully in his cot at night.'
