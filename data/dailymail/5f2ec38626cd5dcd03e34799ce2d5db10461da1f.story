The Quadrantids meteor shower is set to mark the start of New Year in style this weekend when it makes an appearance in the north to north-eastern skies.

Astronomers predict the meteor shower will peak on 3 January at 9pm EST - or 4 January at 2am GMT - and will be visible in northern regions, near the Big Dipper constellation.

The Quadrantid shower is one of the year's most spectacular events, but also the shower that most astronomers miss because it's very brief and intense.

It could provide people in the northern latitudes with the opportunity to see 'Earth-grazers' - stunning meteors that come in close to the horizon to the east and west. 

But, this year, a bright moon could spoil the views for some star gazers, and astronomers are advising people to stand in a position where the moon is blocked by a building or a tree.

Astronomers predict the meteor shower will peak on 3 January at 9pm EST (4 January at 2am GMT).

To view the meteor shower, people living in the northern latitudes will need to look towards 'kite formation' in the constellation Boötes before the shower's peak.

Those in the eastern part of Asia are expected to get the best views with the shower peaking there before dawn on January 4th.

The Quadrantid shower will be at an approximate right angle with the Big Dipper and Arcturus. 

'In fact, the Quadrantids might be the strongest and most famous major meteor shower that you've never seen,' EarthSky said in a separate report.

To view the meteor shower, people living in the northern latitudes will need to look towards 'kite formation' in the constellation Boötes before the shower's peak.

'Look towards the North and the seven famous stars known as The Plough (or 'Big Dipper') which collectively resemble a saucepan,' Colin Stuart, astronomer and author of 'The Big Questions in Science' told MailOnline. 

'Cast your eyes wide around the pan's handle and you should spot fleeting shards of bright light streaking by. 

'These meteors are caused when our planet ploughs through a trail of cosmic rubbish strewn across the solar system by passing comets. When this dust impacts our atmosphere it incinerates, resulting in flashes of light.' 

Those in the eastern part of Asia are expected to get the best views with the shower peaking there before dawn on 4 January.

The Quadrantid shower will be at an approximate right angle with the Big Dipper and Arcturus.

The Quadrantids derive their name from the constellation of Quadrans Muralis - mural quadrant - which was created by the French astronomer Jerome Lalande in 1795.

Quadrans was an early astronomical instrument used to observe and plot stars.

Even though the constellation is no longer recognised by astronomers, it was around long enough to give the meteor shower - first seen in 1825 - its name.

Like the Geminids, the Quadrantids originate from an asteroid, called 2003 EH1.

Studies suggest that this body could very well be a piece of a comet which broke apart several centuries ago, and that the meteors you will see before dawn are the debris from this fragmentation.

After hundreds of years orbiting the sun, they will enter our atmosphere at 90,000 mph (144,800 km/h), burning up 50 miles (80km) above Earth's surface.

'The Quadrantids can be spectacular because the number of possible meteors is comparable to two of the best meteor showers of the year - The Perseids and The Geminids,' Mr Stuart said.

'However, its peak doesn't last as long - hours not days - so you'll need a healthy dose of luck and good timing to catch this year's Quadrantids.' 

The Lyrid shower is the next major meteor shower after the Quadrantids, and is expected between April 16 to 25.

It can be seen in the northern latitudes by looking towards Big Dipper

Astronomers predict it could produce as many as 100 meteors per hour

This year, a bright moon could also hamper attempts to see the meteors
