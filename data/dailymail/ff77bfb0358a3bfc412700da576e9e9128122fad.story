Desperate: Michael Hill carried out a terrifying £20,000 armed robbery after he was kicked out of university for failing to pay his tuition fees. He was jailed for three years

A student who could not afford to pay his tuition fees carried out a terrifying £20,000 armed robbery, a court heard.

Michael Hill, 25, was kicked off his course at Salford University after he was left unable to pay tuition fees when a loan he applied for failed to materialise.

In thousands of pounds worth of debt, and evicted from his student accommodation, Hill  got a bus to a Co-op store, where he had previously worked, and carried out the raid armed with a knife.

The court heard that on August 26 
after wandering around Manchester with his rucksack containing his few 
belongings and £6 cash, he got a bus to Astley, Wigan, and carried out 
the raid. 

Just after 10pm Hill, who had his 
face covered by a scarf, produced a knife, which he had since working at
a DIY store, and demanded staff open the safe. 

He pushed a security guard over and 
grabbed hold of the store manager and claimed there was a bomb in a bag 
on the garage forecourt outside. 

Managing to escape the store with £20,000, Hill was quickly caught 
when a passing motorist saw him being pursued by a security guard and 
pulled in front of him, knocking him to the ground.

He told officers 'It was the biggest mistake of my life' and 
explained he had been at Salford University but 'was kicked off the 
course due to issues about him not paying his fees'. 

Andrew 
Downie, prosecuting said Hill had been working part time but 
due to lack of business that job fell through.

He said he was then thrown out of his 
student accommodation because he could not pay his rent and he amassed 
considerable debts with his bank and family and friends

He slept at friends' addresses before ending up sleeping rough in Manchester.

Big mistake: Hill managed to escape the store with £20,000 but was quickly caught when a passing motorist saw him being pursued by a security guard and pulled in front of him, knocking him to the ground

Hill said: 'I had hit rock bottom and 
for the last couple of days had been contemplating committing a robbery 
to gain cash to solve my debt problems.

'I could not go back to family and friends as I would seem like a leech and a failure.'

Hill was jailed for three years after he pleaded guilty to robbery at Liverpool Crown Court. 

Judge John Phipps said
that carrying out the robbery had been 'no way of dealing with debt 
problems', but he was prepared to accept he was remorseful.

William Swalwell, defending, said that Hill has an impeccable record and is being supported by family and friends. 

A large number of testimonials spoke about his honesty and how out of character his behaviour had been.

He had received a letter threatening legal action about the unpaid university fees and had been left feeling desperate.
