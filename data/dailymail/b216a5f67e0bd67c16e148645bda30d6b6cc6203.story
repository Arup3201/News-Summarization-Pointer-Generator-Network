Hungary today scrapped a planned tax on internet data transfers after angry protests by tens of thousands of people in the last week.

A draft tax bill sparked anger across the country for including a provision for Internet providers to pay a tax of 150 forints (40 pence) per gigabyte of data traffic.

Critics said the law would not only increase the tax burden on people but also curb their fundamental democratic rights and freedoms.

Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government, which has been accused of anti-democratic policies, first unveiled plans for the new tax last week in the draft 2015 tax bill submitted to parliament

Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has been widely accused of adopting anti-democratic policies, shelved the proposals, saying 'people have questioned the rationality' of the measure.

He said the government will hold a national consultation from mid-January about regulating and taxing the Internet and reconsider the matter next year. 

Mr Orban also said Hungary would stick to its plan to offer broadband Internet access to every household by 2020.

The backdown came after tens of thousands of Hungarians took to the streets of Budapest in protest at the new law.

Mr Orban's government first
unveiled plans for the new tax last week in the draft 2015
tax bill submitted to parliament, though it would allow companies to offset corporate income tax against the new levy.

One rally on Sunday was organised by a Facebook group which
has over 210,000 supporters.

The protesters, which some local websites estimated as numbering over 10,000, gathered in front of the Economy Ministry chanting: 'Free Hungary! Free internet!'

The organisers of '100,000 against the Internettax' said in a press release: 'The move... follows a wave of alarming anti-democratic
measures by Orban that is pushing Hungary even further adrift
from Europe.

'The measure would impede equal access to the internet,
deepening the digital divide between Hungary's lower economic
groups, and limiting internet access for cash-poor schools and
universities,' they said.

At one point, protesters held up their mobile phones, lighting up the square in front of the ministry. 

Then they
walked to the city's historic Heroes Square. 

Some of them also
went to the nearby headquarters of the ruling Fidesz party and
threw outdated computer parts at the building, breaking some
windows, local Internet website Index.hu reported.

The organisers gave the government 48 hours to withdraw the
tax legislation and warned of fresh protests.

Fidesz said in a statement on Sunday it would
submit an amendment to the legislation in parliament, which
would set a maximum level on the tax payable by individuals.  

It
said monthly payments would be capped at 700 forints and internet providers would pay the tax.

But some protesters said the new tax was an epitome of the
government's mistaken economic policies. 

'This would be a double tax on us, as I have already paid a
sky-high VAT when I bought the gadgets, computer and router,'
said Attila Sos, 43, who came to the protest with his family.

The rally on Sunday was organised by a Facebook group, which has over 210,000 supporters

'This is a good occasion for a lot of people to come here to
show that they are discontent with the government's tax and
economic policies. This was only the icing on the cake.'

'The Internet connects people and it should not be limited,'
said Krisztina Nagy, 21, who wants to be a Web programmer, and
fears that companies would push the costs of the new tax onto
customers.

Orban's government has in recent years imposed special taxes
on the banking, retail and energy sectors as well as on
telecommunications providers to keep the budget deficit in
check, jeopardising profits in some sectors of the economy and
unnerving international investors.

At the same time, it has cut personal income taxes.
