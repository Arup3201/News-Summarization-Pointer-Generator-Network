A man whose nose was removed during a battle with cancer has had a completely new one reconstructed with bones from his ribs.

Alan Dagless, 56, underwent two years of reconstructive surgery after he lost his nose to a rare form of skin cancer.

Specialists at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle used bones and skin grafts from his legs to build a new nose, which Mr Dagless says has now restored his confidence.

The former joiner said: 'When the bandages were taken off once all the reconstruction was completed, I was amazed. I had been under bandages for so long that I didn't exactly know what to expect. 

'I was so happy to have my nose back. I feel like myself again.'

Mr Dagless, of Whitley Bay, was diagnosed with squamous cellular carcinoma in December 2008 after more than a year of experiencing alarming nosebleeds. 

Mr Dagless's fiance and partner of 20 years Kim Williams, 54, said: 'We were worried. We thought it couldn't be normal for Alan to be experiencing as many nosebleeds as he was. He had up to 20 a day.

'He wasn't experiencing any pain but there was lots of blood. He would be going about his normal business and then suddenly the bleeding would start.

'Our bedsheets were often ruined because of how much blood there was.'

But she said it wasn't until August 2008 when Miss Williams returned from holiday to find her fiance in a state of distress that the couple took action.

She said: 'He looked like Elephant Man - his nose was red and three times the size and his eyes were puffed up.'

Doctors examined Mr Dagless and discovered cancer in his nose. They were also concerned about the cancer spreading to his lymph nodes. 

They recommended the complete removal of Mr Dagless's nose. Miss Williams said she and Mr Dagless's sons Malcolm and Michael, and Miss Williams's son Scott, were shocked.

Mr Dagless said: 'It was difficult to be told that having the nose removed was my only option, but I coped as best I could.'

In January 2009, after 12 hours on the operating table, Mr Dagless emerged from surgery with a bandage covering the deep hole where his nose had once been. 

Despite assurances that the procedure had almost certainly removed all traces of cancer from his body, Mr Dagless faced a traumatic recovery period. 

He said: 'I was a typical man - I kept quiet but I got very down about it. It was tough to cope with such a big change.'

Miss Williams said: 'He kept his feelings to himself. It was only natural that he felt a bit depressed. I had to be strong for him.'

Now, after two years, his transformation is complete and his nose has been completely reconstructed

After a year, Mr Omar Ahmed, a consultant plastic surgeon at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, spoke to the couple about options to restore Mr Dagless's face. 

Mr Dagless said: 'Mr Ahmed said I could either wear a plastic nose or have it rebuilt using tissue from my body. I chose to have it rebuilt, because it was thought it would be better in the long run.'

Mr Dagless's face remained bandaged for the majority of the next two years as he underwent a series of plastic surgery procedures. 

Finally, in December 2012, consultants were ready to remove the dressings permanently.

Miss Williams said: 'It was the first time we'd had a chance to take a really close look. It was marvellous. Mr Ahmed did some really good work.'

The couple now hope to marry once they can afford a honeymoon. 

Mr Dagless said: 'My life has improved enormously. I'm so thankful to Mr Ahmed, who put me at ease and did a simply amazing job.'
