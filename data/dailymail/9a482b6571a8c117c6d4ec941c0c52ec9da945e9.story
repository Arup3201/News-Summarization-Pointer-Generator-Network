Convicted: Jerry Sandusky, the former assistant football coach for Penn State, faces 442 years in jail for child sex abuse

Penn State University has been told its status is 'in jeopardy' as the fallout from the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal continues to rock the east coast campus.

This latest blow comes just a day after fresh allegations were made of a pedophile sex ring involving the once-prestigious college athletics program.

The Middle States Commission on Higher Education has warned the university that it could lose its accreditation because of details uncovered by an internal investigation on Sandusky, which was led by former FBI director Louis Freeh.

The commission also considered the severe penalties imposed by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, because of the way the school reacted to allegations against Sandusky.

The former assistant football coach for Penn State was convicted of 45 counts of child sex abuse in June.

In a statement released on August 8, the commission said Penn State remains accredited while 'on warning', but it wants a monitoring report submitted by the end of next month.

At that time, the university must show the steps it has taken to fully comply with governmental requirements and that it's mission is being carried out.

Penn State must keep the commission fully informed and comply with standards on leadership and governance, as well as integrity.

The commission also wants the report to show how the university will cope financially following the investigation and 'related settlements'.

A team from the commission will visit Penn State to 'verify institutional status and progress.'

Yesterday, officials said they were confident the university could address all the issues raised by the commission.

'This action has nothing to do with the quality of education our students receive,' said Blannie Bowen, vice provost for academic affairs in a statement posted on the university's website.

'Middle States is focusing on governance, integrity, and financial issues related to information in the Freeh report and other items related to our current situation.'

Bowen added that the body does not issue a warning unless it believes an institution can make improvements.

'This is certainly true for Penn State.

'We're confident that our monitoring report and the site visit will confirm this to the commission,' Bowen added.

University president Rodney Erickson said he was also confident officials would be able to 'fully demonstrate our financial stability.'

In the meantime, the FBI has opened a new investigation following allegations made yesterday that Sandusky and a prominent Penn State University donor sexually abused two boys together aboard a private plane.

High hopes: Sandusky was expected to become Penn State's head coach after Joe Paterno, who died in January

Until now, authorities believed Sandusky was a lone abuser. The newest allegations threaten to bring out more horrifying revelations about sexual abuse surrounding the once-prestigious college athletics program.

According to Radar Online, federal authorities are looking into the possibility that Sandusky shared his young victims with other pedophiles including a 'very rich, very powerful man connected with the university.'

The latest allegations come just over a month 
after Sandusky, 68, was convicted on 45 counts of child sexual abuse for
molesting ten boys over the course of 15 years.

He now faces 442 years in prison.
