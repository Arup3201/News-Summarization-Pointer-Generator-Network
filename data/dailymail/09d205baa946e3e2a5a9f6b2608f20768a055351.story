American football fans were ecstatic when the 2014 NFL season kicked off last week but few expressed their joy more perfectly than George the dog.

When shown a recording of the Seattle Seahawks and Green Bay Packers in 2014 season opener, George couldn't contain his excitement - as he well shouldn't given his four-legged status.  

George jumps and barks with vigour from the snap to the down, slightly less so between plays. And he calms down totally during commercial breaks.

NFL fan: George can't take his eyes off the screen as the Green Bay Packers take on the Seattle Seahawks 

When his owner cruelly switches the TV to an old episode of Kevin James sitcom The King of Queens, George isn't especially impressed, but the spring is back in the pooch when he turns back to the game.

'George, did you miss football?' the owner asks. 'I know I did.'

From his joyous frolicking, it's fair to say George did, too. Though it's hard to tell if he's a fan of the Packers or Seahawks, who won 36-16.
