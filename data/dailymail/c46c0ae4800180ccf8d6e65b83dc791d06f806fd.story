After the affair: Actress Antonia de Sancha was pictured outside a cafe 20 years after her affair with Tory minister David Mellor made tabloid headlines

There she sits, fag in hand, hair cascading over her shoulders, woolly coat wrapped around her body to keep off the chill. On a winter’s day, Antonia de Sancha is having lunch outside a tapas restaurant in London. She is ready for her next beer, if not her close-up.

Yet, come on. Antonia looks pretty darn good for a 51-year-old smoker. She still has that lovely skin and the pale, Modigliani face. She still looks in great shape, which is more than you could ever say about David Mellor. Then or now.

Still, can it really be 20 years since she was a femme fatale, to put it politely, who famously romped with goofy Dave when he was a Tory minister in the John Major government?

Have two whole decades really passed since the unlikely couple were making whoopee together?

Of course, that was before Antonia burst their lurvve bubble and became the most famous kiss-and-tell merchant of her day. Their torrid cavortings were splashed all over the newspapers and TV screens for weeks afterwards.

Toe-sucking, spanking, skipping about in a Chelsea football strip? Oh, Excellency, you knew how to spoil us with ministerial affairs back then.

Following her revelations, there was the never-to-be-forgotten spectacle of Mellor parading his wife and children behind a garden gate, like targets on a fairground stall. All in a desperate, doomed attempt to prove his family life was intact. He was just as shameless as she was.

Eventually, Mellor left the government and his wife. Meanwhile, de Sancha tried and failed to cash in on her notoriety. She took part in a documentary about mistresses; she briefly became the agony aunt of Erotic Review magazine.

However, the public — unlike Mellor —remained resistant to her charms. Especially when, after ten years, she admitted the saucier details about their affair were untrue. How unforgiveable! Mellor recently complained her allegation that he insisted on wearing a Chelsea FC strip when making love would follow him to his grave. Pass me a hankie, darlings. That’s enough to bring a tear to a glass eye.

Where did all this get Antonia? She apparently imported textiles and jewellery from India and Thailand for a while. At some point, her brief marriage also failed.

Today, she lives in a one-bedroom flat in a down-at-heel area of London and exhibits few signs of a woman who has made a great triumph of her life.

Cashing in: Antonia de Sancha became the most famous kiss-and-tell merchant of her day

The lover: David Mellor, pictured on the night he quit as Heritage Secretary in 1992, following a number of scandals, including his affair with Miss de Sancha

In contrast, look at David Mellor, who exudes the sleek, satisfied air of the rich and successful international businessman he is. He lives with his glamorous partner, Penelope, Viscountess Cobham. His life is charmed. He has shaken free from his former shame, like a dog wriggling off the raindrops following a storm.

All things considered, Antonia seems to have fared less well. And that is my point. In the world of kiss and tell, short-term gain is always followed by long-term decline. The women almost always come off worse than men, many of whom seem to ultimately survive the bombshell of their indiscretion and go on to thrive, like cockroaches.

Sorry: Escort Jenny Thompson says she is full of regret about her torrid past

For the kissers and tellers, however, there is only the initial, exciting firework explosion of notoriety and fame. Closely followed by nothing but ashes.

Perhaps all this will be noted by Jenny Thompson, the escort girl who made public her affair with married footballer Wayne Rooney. This week she made a TV apology to his wife Coleen.

The 23-year-old said she wanted to apologise about the England and Manchester United star’s infidelity with her while she was a £1,300-a-night call girl. She only embarked on this career, she says, because she was a teenage rebel. It was only later that it ‘become an addiction’.

Ms Thompson has given up being an escort, become a mother and says she is full of regret about her torrid past. 

Asked what she would like to say to Mrs Rooney, she replied simply: ‘I’m sorry.’

Hmmmm! Is she really? If she was truly contrite, wouldn’t she want to spare Mrs Rooney further embarrassment? Wouldn’t she have the good grace to crawl under the nearest luxury rock, instead of rubbing Coleen’s nose in the scandal on a daytime TV show watched by millions?

It is hard to imagine Jenny’s mischievous apology brought any comfort for Mrs Rooney. Let’s face it, she’s not mortified or humbled — she is utterly brazen. Still.

Jenny is only on the telly to promote herself and to try to rehabilitate her reputation. For she is working on a book about her life, no doubt with lots of tell-all sauce about her links to Premier League stars. That’s how truly sorry she is.

And while she might be the centre of attention now, all she has to do is look at Antonia de Sancha to see what the future holds. Not much glamour there!

Twenty years from now, Jenny will understand the pattern. Be they footballers or politicians, powerful men will survive the attentions of their mistresses or consorts, and go on to prosper. While it is unlikely the indiscreet mistress will come out of it well. The woman almost never does. Just ask Antonia.

This week, Sir David Attenborough said that if he had a torch, he would pass it to Professor Brian Cox.

The legendary broadcaster has no plans to retire, but suggested that Cox should take over fronting the BBC’s natural history programmes when he does.

Noooooo!

Cox, who has become a household name following the success of his BBC2 series Wonders Of The Solar System, is hugely popular. He is the man credited with making physics sexy — that’s if you like your quantum theories delivered by someone with a choirboy haircut and a perma-smirk. 

Is he really a worthy successor to peerless David Attenborough? Enthusiasm isn’t everything. Plus the prof is always slightly too pleased with himself for comfort.

And anyone who is never off TV, who made a guest appearance on stage with Gary Barlow, and who still likes to complain about the downside of fame does not my vote get.

Not something Sir David would have ever done. Nor Sir Patrick Moore. Not even David Bellamy. Every blade of grass may have 3.8 billion years of history written into it — but it is still humble.

She's already got the Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild gong, and she’s probably going to get the Bafta, too, closely followed by a lovely, piping hot Oscar.

Is it going to be a straight flush of Best Supporting Actress gongs for Anne Hathaway (above) for her role as Fantine in Les Miserables? Get your hankies at the ready, for I think it has to be a yes.

How can she fail?

Winner: Actress Anne Hathaway has already won a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild award and is hotly-tipped to take home a Bafta and an Oscar

Anne with the quivering, Malteser eyes plays a good girl forced into prostitution to care for her illegitimate child.

She has to go on a starvation diet, get all her hair cut off, swop her prim needlewoman’s dress for a tart’s rags, be ravished by an army captain, get her teeth pulled out, give it the big boo hoo when she sings I Dreamed A Dream (think of Gazza crying at the Word Cup, multiply it by ten and you are almost halfway there), die, get resurrected as a ghost and do all of this in about 15 minutes of screen time.  

Give that woman a medal as well as a gong. She deserves it.

Actor Brendan Coyle is the latest celebrity to reveal himself on Twitter. Reveal himself as a not very nice person, that is.

Brendan — perhaps most famous for playing Mr Bates the valet in Downton Abbey — made several barbed remarks on Twitter about former prime minister, Lady Margaret Thatcher.

As a way of establishing yourself as a political thinker, that’s on a par with spray-painting a peace sign on a wall. I mean, grow up, Brendan.

No wonder that on reading his remarks, NHS consultant Roberta Knighton tweeted him to suggest the comments were beneath him.

The star replied by telling her to ‘go f*** yourself’. Twice.

Oaf! 

Coyle is the kind of Twitter celebrity who only wants followers to agree with his every tiny, gorgeous thought. He will brook no dissent.

Look, if he can’t cope with the modern world of communications, he should go back to brushing dandruff off Lord Grantham’s shoulders. Or just shut up.

Oooh, get him! Karl Lagerfeld is being bitchy again, claiming Michelle Obama ‘looks like a newscaster’ with her new fringe and hairstyle.

Now just hold it right there, K-Lag. I won’t have a word said against FLOTUS (that’s the First Lady of the United States, for those who never watched West Wing).

Bond villain look: Karl Lagerfeld has criticised Michelle Obama for her new fringe haircut

Especially not by some desiccated ogre in leather glovettes and a peroxide comb-over.

What is the Chanel boss like? If he was a Bond villain, Karl would be too far-fetched. As the Child Catcher, he’s more believable.

He’s not just ghastly. He’s not just wrong. He is out of touch with ordinary women who like and admire Michelle for all the right reasons.

What is going on? I read that when appearing on an American chat show this week, Catherine Zeta-Jones (right) ‘easily passed for a woman much younger than 43’.

Oy! There are millions of us out here who don’t think 43 is particularly old. Who would actually love to be 43 again. And not just around the hips.

Meanwhile, Davina McCall complains that because she has long hair at the age of 45, her granny thinks she is a slut.

Yes, the Roaring Forties are a very confusing time.

Iain Duncan Smith believes higher benefits won’t solve child poverty. Let’s hope his findings won’t be howled down by partisan politics, but I’m not holding my breath. Some are accusing him of waging war on the poor. They can do nothing wrong; he can do nothing right. And in the meantime, we can’t move forward.

MRS Brown’s Boys has been the stealth comedy success of the century. Critics hate it, audiences love it. Over Christmas, it beat Miranda and everything else. It is filthy, foul-mouthed and features a man in a dress saying ‘feck’ an awful lot. It’s like a panto put on by a mad family who live at the end of the street. And it’s hilarious.
