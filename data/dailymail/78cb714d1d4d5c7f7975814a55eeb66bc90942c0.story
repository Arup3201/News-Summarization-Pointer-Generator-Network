The young woman whose body was attacked by a flesh-eating bacteria is finally making preparations to leave hospital, nearly two months after she arrived.

Aimee Copeland, from Georgia, is finally moving into a rehabilitation centre after the aggressive disease forced doctors to amputate her left leg, right foot and both hands.

Her delighted family say the 24-year-old will be transferred on Monday and will spend several weeks learning to move, before gradually returning to normal life.

New life: Aimee (right, with her sister) is finally leaving hospital for a rehabilitation centre

Her father Andy said he was 'real excited about leaving' the hospital and 'just wants a change of venue.'

The University of West Georgia graduate 
will be transferred from Doctors Hospital in Augusta to the in-patient 
rehab centre on Monday, but her father declined to say where the therapy centre was.

The 24-year-old developed necrotizing fasciitis in a small cut she suffered after falling from a homemade zip line over a west Georgia river.

She is staying in close touch with her friends and makes regular hour-long phone calls, according to Gary Duke, owner of Sunnyside Cafe, where she used to work.

'She sounds strong and in reasonably good spirits,' Mr Duke told Times Georgian yesterday.

Mr Copeland, who has been keeping a blog about his daughter's condition, posted online to describe the moment she ventured outside yesterday, for 
the first time since she was admitted to hospital 49 days earlier.

'The look on Aimee's face was just 
incredible,' her father, Andy Copeland, told Good Morning America.

'She could smell the pine trees and feel the
breeze through her hair and just the sun on her skin. That was a 
remarkable change for her just to see how she glowed when we took her 
outside.'

While there, they took a photograph of Aimee grinning with her hair pulled into a side ponytail, with her parents smiling either side of her. Bandages cover the ends of her arms.

'Aimee has a beauty in this photograph that I think goes beyond words,' Andy Copeland said. 'It's a beauty of survival, of resilience.'

Her remarkable achievement came just a
day after doctors upgraded her condition from serious to good.

Mr Copeland wrote that, once the family was outside, they reflected on the life-changing events - and Aimee showed breathtaking courage.

'I don’t have any regrets about what has happened,' Aimee told her father. 'I don’t focus on what I’ve lost, I would rather focus on what I’ve gained. I feel like I’ve been blessed.'

She went on: 'I am blessed to have the opportunity to experience something that not many other people have the chance to experience.

Upbeat: On a blog, Aimee's father has said he is amazed by her courage and determination to walk

'I am blessed to have the capacity to 
share my experience with others and have a chance to improve the quality
of someone else's life. I’m blessed to be different.'

Speaking to GMA, her father spoke of her determination to walk at her Master's graduation ceremony this December. 'You heard the word right,' he said. 'Walk. That's what she intends to do.'

Earlier this month, Mr Copeland said his daughter had been enduring the worst pain of the ordeal. Her agony was so overwhelming that she began taking morphine after initially refusing medication.

The
student had originally indicated that she felt a 'traitor to her 
convictions' by using drugs to manage her pain, because she believed in 
holistic medicine.

Injuries: Aimee had her left leg, right foot and both hands amputated. She also lost part of her torso

She also suffered phantom pains. Mr Copeland wrote: 'Although she has no hands, her brain
is apparently still telling her body that the hands are there.

'I asked 
her if she could describe the pain and she told me, "It feels like I 
have been carrying bags of rocks".'

The
University of West Georgia student had to have multiple amputations to save her life 
after the small cut to her leg became infected.

The bacteria that attacked her wound released a toxin that destroys skin, muscle and a layer
of tissue below the skin known as fascia, her father said.

Aimee has 
improved incredibly rapidly with the support of her family and 
well-wishers who have made donations on the website Mr Copeland set up 
for his brave daughter.

Mr
Copeland wrote that support Aimee has come from all over the US, including from celebrities like Sophia Vergara, Katie Couric and 
Ann Curry.

Less than a month ago, doctors gave her
little chance of survival, but she became increasingly alert, despite 
several major operations, but she is likely to remain hospitalised for several more months.

'This
doctor can't fathom a reason for why she's improved the way she has,' 
Mr Copeland said. 'Her spirits are extraordinarily high. I am absolutely
amazed.'

Necrotizing
fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but
extremely vicious bacterial infection. 'Necrotizing' refers to 
something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy 
skin, muscles and fat.

The
disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a 
minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that 
kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area.

Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body.

Symptoms
include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading 
bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock 
are also common complications.

Sufferers
must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given 
powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can 
become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg.

Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons.

There are 500 to 1,500 cases reported a year, but 20 to 25 percent of victims die.
