Helen Fospero says a midriff-revealing crop-top would be the last thing on my mind when choosing an on-air outfit

From the High Street to high-end boutiques, cropped tops are everywhere this season. But if you’re over  40 or a mum — or both, like me — I bet you’ve never tried one, and are happily letting this trend pass you by. Big mistake.

In my job as a TV presenter on Daybreak, I’ve interviewed stars such as Elton John, Gwyneth Paltrow and Madonna. Sitting next to such icons I have to look my best, so I go for fitted dresses and pencil skirts. 

A midriff-revealing crop-top would be the last thing on my mind when choosing an on-air outfit.

At 47, the moment for flashing my tummy has passed. I have two children, Francesca, nine, and Jack, four, and these days my stomach isn’t my best feature. I’d never dream of airing it in public.

But when I saw a friend layering a crop-knit over a slinky top, I realised that shrunken styles don’t automatically equal bared belly buttons.

You just need some clever styling tricks. It’s revolutionary: the cropped shape tricks the eye, elongating your bottom half, making you look taller, slimmer and drawing attention away from your stomach as the hem falls at the slimmest point of your waist.

Fashion editor Eliza Scarborough showed me how.

A crop top is a modern substitute for a shawl and brilliant for concealing upper arms. I can’t believe this top and dress together cost less than £100! I love the drama of the kimono-style sleeves. The thick fabric of the dress is very forgiving, skimming over the tummy rather than accentuating it. I’m also a fan of nude shoes as they lengthen my legs. This crop top is perfect for a wedding or the races, but you could also dress it down with skinny jeans.

Shirts are a weekend staple of mine. I usually wear them with skinny jeans and boots when I head out for coffee or go shopping. But I’d never thought to pair them with a cropped top before. Shirts are great at disguising bits you’d rather hide, but if you’re not careful, they can make you look shapeless. A smooth, cropped jumper worn over the top solves the problem as it enhances your figure. A casual yet chic bargain.

A simple jersey pencil skirt goes great with a crop top — the high waist means there’s no flesh on show and the sleek silhouette is slimming.

The stripes on this trendy skirt make my body look longer and the gentle ribbing on the cotton jumper is flattering on the bust. It’s not too short, and while the neckline is a little high for me, I like the long sleeves — perfect for this time of year. Even though the top is not tucked in, I feel secure. Perfect for a lunch or even a dinner party.

Picka gorgeous jumper, like this cornflower blue number, and wear it over a long-sleeved dress for a chic look.

I like the idea of wearing a cropped knit over a dress with the sleeves sticking out — it brings the outfit together.

But I’m not sure this is the right dress for a mum like me. Though it’s comfortable, it’s also clingy and thin, so it’s unflattering on the tummy area.

I’d have to hold in my stomach permanently to get away with this — or wear a good pair of Spanx.

I was pleasantly surprised when I looked in the mirror when I tried this on. Suddenly I’ve got a bust! Not much to look at on the hanger, this clingy top is deceptively supportive and the square neckline is flattering. Paired with high-waisted jeans, or classic black trousers it’s perfect for a casual day out. The only problem was that the tight Lycra fabric rode up, meaning you could sometimes see my bare back, so I’m not sure I would buy it.
