Rebel leaders in Syria warned last night that gunmen linked to Al Qaeda were undermining the battle to oust tyrant Bashar al-Assad.

Hundreds of rebel fighters are defecting and pledging allegiance to the extremists, according to sources.

Entire units are said to have joined the small but powerful Al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in recent days.

A good, clean fight? Hundreds of rebel fighters, not pictured, are defecting and pledging allegiance to the extremists

‘This is a sign the radical groups are
 still growing in power ... this region could fall to the jihadists,’ 
said an activist in the eastern town of Raqqa, adding: ‘We may see this 
become a trend.’

At least two entire rebel brigades are
 said to have joined the Nusra Front in opposition-held Raqqa, which 
borders Turkey. One of the groups, the Raqqa Revolutionaries, is said to
 have about 750 fighters.

A video uploaded by activists from 
Raqqa yesterday showed a massive convoy of fighters on cars and trucks 
with artillery and machine guns as they waved black flags. The video’s 
title said it was a newly unified force of Nusra fighters and other 
rebel battalions which had recently pledged loyalty.

In one glimmer of reconciliation, Al 
Qaeda fighters and a rival Syrian rebel group agreed a truce to end two 
days of vicious infighting in the northern town of Azaz which militant 
Islamists had seized from more moderate rebels.

The clashes – dubbed a ‘civil war 
within the civil war’ – have alarmed London, Washington and Paris, 
especially as it is seen as weakening the two-and-a-half-year revolt 
against Assad. Fighting has been intensifying between Nusra/ISIL and the
 less effective but more moderate forces that make up the majority of 
opposition fighters.

Many Syrian rebels are attracted to 
radical units because they are generally more effective than the 
moderate forces which have Western backing but receive only halting 
military aid.

Islamists have steady, private sources
 of funding and experienced militants, many of them from abroad, who 
have fought US forces in Iraq or Afghanistan. The divisions in the 
anti-Assad forces have led to warnings that any US-led military strikes 
would help Al Qaeda factions and that weapons supplied by the Western 
allies could end up in their hands.

During the time ISIL has controlled 
Azaz, it is reported to have made several arrests of activists, 
journalists and even sharia court officials. One witness inside the town
 said no-one was smoking on the streets – tobacco is forbidden under 
some strict interpretations of Islamic doctrine.

Yet the opposition to Assad remains 
widespread. One example of its diversity is the all-female Mother Aisha 
battalion in Aleppo, comprising former teachers whose members cover 
their faces as they carry out duties such as reconnaissance.

Syria yesterday submitted some details
 of its chemical weapons to the Organisation for the Prohibition of 
Chemical Weapons in The Hague – a significant step in the plan to 
destroy them under a joint Russian-US proposal.

Syria’s deputy prime minister Qadri 
Jamil was reported to have said the civil war had reached stalemate, 
with neither government forces nor rebels strong enough to win – and 
that Damascus would use proposed talks in Geneva to call for a 
ceasefire. But it was later claimed he had been misquoted.
