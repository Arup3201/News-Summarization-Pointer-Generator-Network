Women in their 40s could have IVF on the NHS under updated guidelines this week.

The changes could also make it easier for lesbian couples to receive free IVF.

Current advice, from 2004, recommends the taxpayer stop funding IVF at the age of 39.

Currently IVF is only offered on the NHS to women aged 39 or under but this could be increased to 42

A draft of overhauled guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence suggests raising the age limit to 42 for some women who have not had fertility treatment before and have no other chance of having a baby.

They would be given one attempt at IVF, rather than the recommended three cycles for younger women.

It also proposes giving IVF on the NHS to lesbians who have already tried other techniques.

Some, but not all clinics, already do this. However, the topic isn’t addressed under existing rules.

The change would bring the advice in line with fertility laws which no longer require clinics to take into account a father’s influence to approve treatment.

Dr Jane Stewart, secretary of the British Fertility Society, said: ‘Fertility problems are a bona fide health issue and should be funded as such. However, there is a risk that without central direction there will continue to be variation according to postcode, and that is regrettable.’

The plans could benefit lesbians who have already tried other techniques. Some clinics already offer this

The updated guidelines, which will be finalised on Wednesday, are designed to take into account progress in IVF treatment.

NICE says it wants to ensure that everyone who has fertility problems has ‘access to the best levels of help’.

But campaign groups have accused it of social engineering, saying that approving IVF for lesbians amounts to deliberately depriving children of a father.

Other recommendations include cutting the amount of time that couples need to wait before being referred for IVF from three years to two.
