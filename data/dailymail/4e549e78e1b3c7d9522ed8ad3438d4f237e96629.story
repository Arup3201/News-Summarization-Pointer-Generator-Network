With Tomas Rosicky rolling back the years against Brighton on Saturday to help Arsenal to a 3-2 win in the FA Cup fourth round, there has been no shortage of plaudits for the Czech midfielder.

Certainly, the 34-year-old has proven himself to be one of Arsene Wenger's most successful signings since joining from Borussia Dortmund in 2006.   

We asked JustArsenal blogger Bob Allock to give us the rundown on how Rosicky has won over so many fans' hearts and etched himself into Gunners' folklore.  

Tomas Rosicky is proving his worth to the Arsenal cause and deserves a contract extension at the club

Rosicky put in a man of the match performance as Arsenal beat Brighton 3-2 in the FA Cup fourth-round

After the Arsenal and Czech Republic star Tomas Rosicky put in a fantastic creative performance at the heart of midfield, which rightly earned him the Man of the Match award, Arsene Wenger was quick to heap praise on the 34-year old.

The Frenchman said, 'He was wonderful. A player we all love. If you love football, you love Rosicky. On top of that he's a fantastic character, scored and I'm very pleased for him.'

And this just highlights what the Arsenal fans have known for a long time, that Rosicky embodies the manager's football philosophy. The way that Rosicky plays the game, with superb technical ability and the drive and attacking intent to go with it, is what we want to see from the Gunners. 

The way he can control and set the tempo of the game, as well as some of the outrageous bits of skill he produces is the reason why the fans call him `little Mozart`.

Some people do not seem to appreciate his talents quite as much, as Phil Neville showed by calling his reverse passes against Brighton `disrespectful`. Neville later claimed that his comments were tongue in cheek, but I for one don't buy it. 

Some people still seem to want football to return to the days of heavy leather boots and ball on muddy pitches, with defenders allowed to get away with GBH to stop these uppity skillful players making fools of them.

Arsenal fans, however, and most modern football fans, appreciate special talents and Rosicky has certainly been one of them. He may not weigh in with lots of goals for the Gunners, but he has blessed us with some special and important ones and he is one of those players that is worth the ticket price alone. 

One of the longest serving Gunners, Rosicky embodies the way that Arsenal want to play the game, with panache and with entertainment a close second to results.

He scored with a well taken volley to give help restore Arsenal's two goal cushion in the second-half

Rosicky joined Arsenal from Borussia Dortumund in 2006 and has since made 235 appearances for the club

His superb goal yesterday, giving the Brighton defenders `the eyes` and effortlessly volleying in the return pass from Giroud was special but his goal against Sunderland last February was probably his best and more typical of his all-round contribution. 

It was more of a team goal for one thing, with Rosicky picking the ball up on the right and going on a mazy run and making not one, but two deft one-two's with Cazorla and then Giroud as he made the Sunderland players look like they were standing in treacle as he burst into the box and finished with a sublime dink over the keeper.

So there was no doubt from Arsenal fans that he was worth the contract extension that he signed towards the end of the last campaign or that he is worth another at the end of this one.  

More surprising to us is that Wenger has not made more use of him, with just six starts in all competitions so far this season and three of those in domestic cup games.

Yesterday's performance was not unexpected from our midfield maestro at all. Rosicky is no spring chicken but he always shows the same energy, enthusiasm and ability as ever and I for one am hoping to be able to appreciate him more this season and at least one more. 

Sign him up Arsene, because talents like Rosicky do not come along too often.
