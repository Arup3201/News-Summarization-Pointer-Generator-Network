Wigan's former Hull KR stand-off Blake Green will make his comeback from a three-month injury lay-off in Thursday's Super League match against his old club.

Green, who made 35 appearances for the Robins in 2011 and 2012, has been sidelined since suffering a ruptured bicep at the Magic Weekend in May.

'Greeny is good to play and it's a huge boost to have him returning to the side after such a spell in the medical room,' Wigan coach Shaun Wane said. 'He has worked hard to get back to fitness and deserves this.'

Wigan are also boosted by the return of forward Eddy Pettybourne, who has been out for a month with a jaw injury, while hooker Michael McIlorum and centre Iain Thornley are both a week away from making their comebacks.

'Micky and Iain are very close but this game came a little too soon for them,' Wane added. 'It is great having all these players returning but the young lads, like George Williams and Sam Powell, have been outstanding.

'They have earned their right to be selected so will still be there fighting for their place.

'I had some selection headaches this week and we have some talent not in the squad. It is great competition for the players which will hopefully improve our performances.'

Hull KR coach Chris Chester has recalled the fit-again Craig Hall in place of an out-of-form Kris Welham.
