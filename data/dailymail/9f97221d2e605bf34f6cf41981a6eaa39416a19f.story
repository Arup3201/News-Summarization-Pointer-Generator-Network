In a cloud of smoke and with a thunderous blast three historic towers were demolished today after dominating an English town's skyline for more than four decades.

The three southern towers of Didcot A power station in Oxfordshire were brought down by more than 180kg of explosives in a matter of seconds.

Hundreds of locals are thought to have defied the guidance issued by power company RWE npower to stay away from the site and watch the demolition via a webcam livestream.

The last time the cooling towers could be seen dominating the Oxfordshire skyline. Moments later, 180kg of explosives sent them crashing to the ground

The towers had been on the Didcot site for more than 40 years, but the controlled explosions which destroyed them down took only 15 seconds

The decision to demolish the towers in the early hours of the morning angered some locals, with a petition to change the timing gaining more than 3,000 signatures.

The town council had also expressed its disappointment but npower said the timeslot between 3am and 5am had been chosen on health and safety grounds.

The time took into account the risk of people getting too close to the explosion, and the impact of the dust cloud on local roads and a nearby rail line.

Warning sirens were sounded 15 and then 10 minutes before the explosion at 5am.

Didcot Power Station was constructed from 1964 to 1968 at a cost of Â£104million.

The combined coal and oil power plant featured a chimney 200m tall and cooling towers approximately 100m high.

Controversial even when proposed, a 'yes' vote to proceed with its construction was successful because of the number of jobs it was expected to bring to the region.

In later years the power plant was the focus of several environmental protests.

In 2006 and 2009, Greenpeace protestors invaded the station, chaining themselves to conveyor belts and climbing the chimneys - on one occasion, even painting 'Blair's Legacy' across it.

Its 2013 closure came about due to EU directives to reduce carbon emissions and RWE npower declined to update it with power generation technology that would allow it to continue.

During the build-up to the explosion 
#DidcotDemolition was trending on Twitter, and one Oxfordshire resident 
said: 'This has gotta be Didcot's most momentous occasion since we won 
the FA vase.'

As many as 1,500 people gathered at nearby Wittenham Clumps to watch the action unfold, the Oxford Mail reported in a liveblog on its website.

For those who chose to watch the demolition online there were some technological gripes.

One local tweeted: 'The demolition cam is very intermittent... what are the odds it's offline at the crucial moment? #DidcotDemolition.'

The coal-fired power station ceased generating in March last year after dominating the skyline around the town since 1970, with the neighbouring gas-fired Didcot B continuing.

The towers' appearance was not universally appreciated with many people finding them an eyesore, although many on Twitter expressed sadness the towers were gone.

'Boom! There goes another piece of my childhood,' one wrote.

Another
 said: 'Can't believe that 3 of the Didcot towers will be demolished 
tonight. A beacon that showed some of us were nearly home.'

Hannah Smart wrote: 'Sad to say goodbye to these beauties #DidcotDemolition - iconic Oxfordshire landmark.'

Following the demolition some of those who had watched it described it as 'epic', 'pretty dramatic to watch' and 'strangely emotional'.

Mark Coleman, managing director of specialist demolition firm, Coleman & Company said it had been job well done.

He tweeted: '#DidcotDemolition well done to all involved. A professional textbook job. Thank you to all the locals. I hope you enjoyed it.'

The early morning skyline in Didcot provided a wonderful backdrop for the explosion as crews undertook their final preparations for the demolition
