British Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha arriving at the annual Conservative Party Black and White Fundraising Ball

A doorstep lender, property magnates and a Ukrainian-born energy tycoon were among guests worth £22billion who attended the Tories' biggest fundraising event.

The news will add to concerns that the country's richest people enjoy privileged access to David Cameron and his Cabinet ministers.

A secret table plan for the 570 guests at the party's Black And White Ball in February reveals many are placed next to ministers whose portfolios are linked to their financial interests.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith was seated with directors of CLC Finance, a doorstep-lending company that offers loans at 769.9 per cent annual interest.

The Government has been accused of going soft on payday lenders, which charge exorbitant interest rates that leave many customers unable to afford repayments.

The analysis of the seating plan at the ball in Old Billingsgate Market in the City of London, was carried out by The Guardian and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.

There is no suggestion that guests – who pay £450 to £1,000 each for seats – discussed policy or their business interests with ministers and MPs.

The then housing minister Kris Hopkins sat with property executives Bruce Ritchie and Paul Munford who arrange the purchase of trophy homes for multi-millionaire foreigners.

Michael Fallon, who was then energy minister, dined with Alexander Temerko, Ukrainian-born owner of Tyneside firm Offshore Group Newcastle, or OGN, which supplies the offshore renewable energy industry and has donated to MPs whose constituencies are earmarked for wind farms.

Mr Temerko and OGN have given at least £537,655 to the Tories since February 2012.

David Cameron shared a table with Lord Chelsea, whose family is worth £4.2billion and is among London's most prominent hereditary landowners.

Campaigners said last night it was wrong that party political functions such as conferences and fundraisers were exempt from rules obliging ministers to declare all meetings.

Sir Alistair Graham, former chairman of the Committee for Standards in Public Life, said: 'It is worrying that the Conservative Party, the party of government, should continue to hold fundraising events in such a 'hole in the corner' manner.

'The public does not know – and has a right to know – that these events are taking place, together with who is attending, from the industries and the Government, so we can track over the forthcoming months if policy sweeteners have been promised as an incentive to attract donations.'

Labour MP Karl Turner said: 'If anybody wanted further proof of how David Cameron and top Tories rub shoulders with tycoons and oligarchs, here it is. There are serious questions of whether Government policy is being dictated by powerful vested interests.'

A Tory Party spokesman said: 'All donations are declared and published by the Electoral Commission. Lists of all ministerial meetings with external organisations are published on a quarterly basis. Ministers meet a range of organisations.

'Any suggestion that policy is influenced by donations is malicious and defamatory and will be treated as such.'

A spokesman for OGN said: 'Any allegation that there was any attempt by Mr Temerko or OGN or its representatives to influence policy in relation to wind farms is false.'
