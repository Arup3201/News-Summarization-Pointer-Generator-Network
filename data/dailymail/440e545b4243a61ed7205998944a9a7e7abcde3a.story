The Bank of England has denied claims by Scottish finance secretary John Swinney that they have had talks on the future currency of Scotland

The Bank of England has denied claims made by a senior Scottish minister that they have discussed arrangements for a currency union if Scotland becomes independent.

Threadneedle Street yesterday issued a statement slapping down comments made by Scottish finance secretary John Swinney on Wednesday.

In a post on the Scottish National Party’s website, Mr Swinney said: ‘The Scottish government has had technical discussions with the Bank of England regarding out proposal for a currency union and we welcome their continued acknowledgment that the bank will introduce whatever the politicians decide.’

But in a humiliating rebuke, the Bank of England said: ‘To be clear the Bank of England has not entered into discussions with representatives of the Scottish government about proposals for future monetary arrangements in Scotland.’

Insiders said there have only been discussions about how the Bank dispenses its existing powers.

This is the second time the Bank has been forced to give a public dressing down to Mr Swinney, who joined the Scottish National Party at the age of 15.

In December 2012, the 50 year old told the House of Lord Economic Affairs Committee that the Scottish government has been ‘in very helpful dialogue’ with the Bank over the SNP’s key policy to keep the pound if the Scots vote to leave the UK.

The Bank of England issued a statement shortly afterwards saying no such discussions had taken place.

The issue of a formal currency union- - in which an independent Scotland continues to use the pound and agrees to the sovereignty of the Bank of England to set interest rates - has become a highly politically charged issue.

Chancellor George Osborne and Treasury secretary have both insisted it is ‘wrong’ to suggest there would be a currency union if there is a ‘yes’ vote in the referendum on September 18.

But Mr Swinney described this as the ‘scaremongering and threats of UK politicians’ in his statement on Wednesday.

Describing a currency union as a done deal, he said: ‘The Scottish Government is clear that an independent Scotland will use the pound and we will do so in a currency union.’

The rift with the Bank of England comes after governor Mark Carney admitted on Wednesday that it is making contingency plans for a ‘yes’ vote.

He also offered reassurance that the Bank would stand behind Scottish based banks, at least during the 18 month period between the referendum and ‘independence day’ next March.

Speaking at the Inflation Report press conference on Wednesday, the Canadian said:

‘In terms of financial stability questions – whatever happens in the vote – the Bank of England will continue to be the authority for financial stability for some period – certainly over the interim period.’

The Bank of England is the lender of last resort for UK institutions.

One concern voiced by firms is that their borrowing costs could go up if they lose the safety net of the Bank of England.

Those affected could include Edinburgh-based Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds if they choose not to move their registered headquarters south of the border.

Last night Mr Swinney came under fire from Alistair Darling, the former Chancellor and head of the Better Together campaign against Scottish independence.

He said: ‘I cannot remember a time when the Bank of England have had to rebuke a politician in such stringent terms. 

'Yesterday John Swinney told us the Scottish Government was having discussions with the Bank of England on a currency union.

'Today the Bank of England have said categorically that no such discussions on future monetary arrangements took place.’

He added: ‘In two weeks the ballot papers will start to be issued for postal votes. Imagine what would have happened if people had only found out about this after they had voted. The currency we use is critical for everyone with savings, mortgages, rent to pay and shopping to buy.’

A Scottish Government spokesman said: 'The Scottish Government has had ongoing technical discussions with the Bank of England, as the Bank itself has previously confirmed.

'We have always made clear that these are technical discussions and not negotiations, and that we respect the neutrality and independence of the Bank, which had made clear it will implement whatever is agreed.'
