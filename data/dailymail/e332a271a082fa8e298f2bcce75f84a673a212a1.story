We have been here before, of course — a breathless Liverpool win over Manchester City secured by the brilliant right foot of Philippe Coutinho. That was last April and we all know what happened next.

This time, the Liverpool charge is locked on a different target. Last season, despite their slaying of City at Anfield, they could not secure the Barclays Premier League title and it remains to be seen if this tilt at the top four ends more happily.

If it does, this will be looked upon as a pivotal day.

Liverpool's winning goal came after a long passage of build up before Philippe Coutinho fired the ball past Joe Hart. Click here to check out our brilliant Match Zone for pitch maps, heat maps and all the stats from the Anfield side's crucial victory.

No doubt feeling Thursday night’s Europa League exit in their minds and legs, Brendan Rodgers’ team faced a fresher City side hungry to close the gap on Chelsea at the top.

Still, though, Liverpool won, still they managed to take another step towards hauling in Manchester United and Arsenal in the places above them. This really was a remarkable effort, perhaps one of the most significant of Rodgers’ reign.

For City, questions remain. Manager Manuel Pellegrini still cannot find a way to secure the centre of the field in games such as this. Sky Sports pundits Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher described City’s lack of control in that area as ‘embarrassing’. That may be overstating it but City continue to be undone the same way in too many big games. Last season they got away with it but this time round they may not.

Having said that, it took a heck of a goal to win this. Coutinho was the game’s star player. Rarely has Pablo Zabaleta on the City right had such an uncomfortable time.

The goal, though, was something else. A right-foot shot from the angle of the box, it was so perfect in angle and trajectory that Joe Hart, though he had plenty of time to see it, had absolutely no chance of stopping it. 

It came out of nothing. The game had fallen into a fallow period with 15 minutes to go. Pellegrini had sent on an extra midfield player in an attempt to close the game down and a contest that had been open for an hour had become scratchy.

Perhaps Coutinho sensed the mood. That is what the best players do. Perhaps he knew that if he didn’t take the occasion by the lapels and shake two extra points from it, nobody else would.

He had been a pest earlier, too. City had started the brighter of the sides and could have taken the lead when Yaya Toure chipped a cute ball over the top for Zabaleta to volley over. 

Jordan Henderson continues to impress in the Liverpool midfield and he curled home the opening goal against Manchester City

Ten minutes in, though, Liverpool suddenly clicked and Coutinho was at the heart of it. First he played Adam Lallana through a gaping hole between Vincent Kompany and Eliaquim Mangala, only for the midfielder to shoot weakly at Hart. Then, moments later, Lallana lashed the ball into the net from an angle, only to be ruled offside.

Pressure was mounting and it wasn’t long before Liverpool were ahead. Fernandinho sold Kompany short with a pass in midfield and when the Belgian could not catch Coutinho, the ball was funnelled forwards to Jordan Henderson. The England man moved the ball out of his feet and curled it past Hart with his right instep from 20 yards.

It was a lovely goal and the celebrations by the Liverpool bench said everything for its importance. For a while, Liverpool were at their waspish best and, as a result, City rocked. 

Liverpool were not in front for long as Edin Dzeko finished off a delightful team passing move to bring parity to the Anfield clash

Sergio Aguero did race through to strike a post but at the other end Alberto Moreno wasted one chance and Raheem Sterling — once again playing as a centre forward — ran on to a Coutinho pass to mug Toure and slide a cross-shot wide.

At 1-0, Liverpool were in the ascendancy. City, though, looked dangerous when they moved forwards and after Coutinho had erred for once by presenting a clearance to Zabaleta in the 26th minute, the visitors moved through the gears, enabling Edin Dzeko to run on to Aguero’s neat through pass and beat Simon Mignolet with his right foot.

For a while, this was a contest that crackled with energy and attacking threat. Coutinho was Liverpool’s go-to man throughout while, for City, David Silva was equally dangerous. The Spaniard enjoyed himself at Anfield last season and was prominent once again here. Lallana screwed a chance wide late in the first half following Lazar Markovic’s lovely chip, while Aguero and Sterling missed opportunities at the start of the second period that they perhaps should have taken.

Beyond Coutinho’s goal, City did raise themselves a little. Silva slashed a chance wide after a buccaneering Toure run while Aguero did likewise. At the Kop End, meanwhile, Sturridge ran clear but could not convert.

At full-time, it felt a significant result. But, to repeat, we have been here before.
