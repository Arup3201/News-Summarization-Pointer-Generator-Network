'12:45 is a good kick-off time. I like it,' Arsene Wenger says. That is despite early Saturday defeats last season to Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea. Four goals scored, 17 conceded.

City will be hoping to replicate their 6-3 performance at the Etihad Stadium, while Wenger insists his game will be on their guard this time. But what is it about 12:45pm Premier League kick-offs and Arsenal?

Well, even before last season Arsenal promised to entertain, defy the odds and occasionally fall apart when kicking off early.

Arsenal suffered three big early kick-off defeats against Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea last season

Sitting pretty at the top of the Premier League table when visiting Liverpool at Anfield last season, the Gunners were nicely backed to beat Brendan Rodgers' side. Four goals early on though, and the game was over.

Similarly at Chelsea, early strikes for the hosts plus a sending off to Kieran Gibbs put Arsenal out of the tie on BT Sport.

'Would you rather kick off at three o’clock or 12:45?' Wenger asked on Thursday. 'It’s two hours and 15 minutes. That does not produce a miracle in your physical recovery.'

2013/14

August 24: Fulham (a) won 3-1

October 26: Crystal Palace (a) won 2-0

December 14: Manchester City (a) lost 6-3

February 8: Liverpool (a) lost 5-1

FA CUP March 8: Everton (h) won 4-1

March 22: Chelsea (a) lost 6-0

But Arsenal were noticeably unprepared for the early fixtures, and have been in the past, too.

Over the last three seasons Wenger's side have won seven, drawn two and lost seven of their 12.45pm kick-off's. Not too bad a record when considering last season.

32 goals scored and 38 conceded in these 16 fixtures tell you one thing, while the games themselves are surprising, almost random.

Beating Tottenham 5-2, drawing with relegation contenders Norwich 3-3, beating Chelsea 5-3 away from home but falling to Blackburn in a seven-goal thriller at Ewood Park.

The Gunners have enjoyed some early kick-off success, beating Chelsea 5-3 in 2011

Arsenal conceded 17 goals against their title rivals last season including five at Anfield

Over the last three seasons, Arsenal have treated neutral fans to some high-scoring matches...  

2013/14: L 6-0 Chelsea, L 5-1 Liverpool, L 6-3 Manchester City 

2012/13: W 5-2 Tottenham 

2011/12: D 3-3 Norwich, W 5-3 Chelsea, L 4-3 Blackburn 

The only notable high-scoring fixture Arsenal avoided in these early kick-offs was an 8-2 defeat to Manchester United; luckily for the statistics that was on a Sunday.

Wenger protests that the results last season were purely a coincidence, and more a combination of a great performance from the opposition and a poor Arsenal showing. After all, a 4-1 win against Everton in the FA Cup came at 12:45pm.

Arsenal have the chance to right what was wrong last season against the league champions. They have already beaten Manuel Pellegrini's side, albeit in the Community Shield, and are armed with the fire power to blow City away.

But Wenger must prepare his team better mentally, and perhaps more importantly physically to get the required result. Either way, expect goals at the Emirates Stadium.
