The family of a postal worker named as being a mole working with the Great Train Robbers has dismissed the claims - insisting he never flashed the cash.

Gordon Goody, 85, a surviving member of the gang, has named Patrick McKenna as the inside man in a new documentary.

He broke his 51-year silence to reveal the identity of the man previously known only as The Ulsterman.

But the family of Mr McKenna, a quiet Post Office employee who died with just £3,000 in his bank account, say they find it hard to believe he was the middleman.

'He was very straitlaced and honest,' his grandson, Mark McKenna, said.

'When I was young I remember going shopping with him at Asda. Me and my mum lived with my grandparents, so he was like my dad.

'He was one of those who would sit there at the end of the month comparing his till receipts to his bank statement.'

The 41-year-old, of Eccles, Salford, added: 'When mum was younger they struggled with money.

'She was walking around with holes in her shoes.

'Every time he bought a car it had to be on hire purchase.

'It's obviously quite a shock that he could have been involved in something like this.

'My reaction was, "What, my grandad?" My mum doesn't believe it at all.'

Mr McKenna says that by 1963, his grandfather had left London for the north west to live near his wife's family.

He says his grandfather, who died of a heart attack in 1992, never showed any sign of having a large amount of cash that would indicate he had been involved in a heist.

'If he did get this kind of money, none of us ever saw any of it,' he said.

'I am still finding it all very hard to believe because of the kind of person that he was.

'The documentary makers insist it can't be anyone else, however.'

Goody's account is that McKenna picked up his share - the equivalent of several million pounds today - in two holdalls and a mailbag and piled them into the boot of a grey Austin car.

Goody has revealed all for a new film made in the wake of the deaths last year of other Great Train Robbers, including Ronnie Biggs.

The Great British Train Robbery: A Tale of Two Thieves is in cinemas on Friday and on DVD, Blu-ray and download from October 6. 

Bruce Reynolds

Gang-leader and mastermind Reynolds was nicknamed 'Napoleon' and after the Great Train Robbery he fled to Mexico on a false passport and was joined by his wife, Angela, and son, Nick.

They later moved on to Canada but the cash from the robbery ran out and he came back to England.

Five years after the heist, in 1968, a broke Reynolds was captured in Torquay and sentenced to 25 years in jail.

He was released on parole in 1978 and moved, alone and penniless, into a tiny flat off London's Edgware Road.

In the 1980s he was jailed for three years for dealing amphetamines.

After his second release, Reynolds went on to work briefly as a consultant on a film about the robbery, Buster, and published the Autobiography of a Thief in 1995. His son Nick said his father died in his sleep in the early hours of February 28 2013.

Ronnie Biggs

Ronald Arthur 'Ronnie' Biggs played a minor role in the robbery, but his life as a fugitive after escaping from prison gained him notoriety. He was given a 30-year sentence in 1964, but he escaped after 15 months by fleeing over the walls of London's Wandsworth prison in April 1965.

After having plastic surgery, he lived as a fugitive for 36 years in first Australia then Brazil, where he fathered a son Michael.

His health deteriorated in 2001 and he returned to the UK voluntarily where he was sent back to prison.

Ronald 'Buster' Edwards

Edwards served nine years in jail and then became a familiar figure selling flowers outside Waterloo station in London.

He was the subject of the 1988 film Buster, in which he was played by Phil Collins.Edwards was found hanged in a garage in 1994 at the age of 62. Two wreaths in the shape of trains accompanied his funeral cortège.

He was captured again in Canada after four years on the run and served 10 more years in jail.

He was the final train robber to emerge from prison in 1978.

Wilson moved to Marbella, Spain, where he was shot and killed by a hitman on a bicycle in 1990.
