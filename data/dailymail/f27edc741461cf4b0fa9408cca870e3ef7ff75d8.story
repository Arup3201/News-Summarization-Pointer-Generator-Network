Former footy star Senator Glenn Lazarus has claimed politics is 'tougher' than anything he faced on the field.

The rugby league great and one of the Palmer United Party's star recruits has revealed he is feeling the pressure after being elected to the Senate in the 2013 federal election.

The 48-year-old told Fairfax Radio 4BC Mornings: 'I am very confident in my ability as a footballer, so I would have to say playing State of Origin and playing rugby league certainly came a lot easier to me pressure wise, I think politics would take that hands down.'

Responding to the recent criticism he faced after it was revealed he had ripped off information from Wikipedia to inform followers about his state of Queensland, he said: 'If that is a real crime, then I am guilty.'

Senator Glenn Lazarus, the footballer they called 'the brick with eyes' is now in the eye of a political storm amid allegations he has plagiarised Wikipedia's Queensland website

The accusations of plagiarism stemmed from his personal website senatorlazarus.com, where details about the state's primary industries appear to have been simply cut and pasted onto his page.

'I've had some pretty violent and a huge footballers try to rip my head off and I think I am big enough and ugly enough to handle the criticism, but that sort of doesn't sit well with me when my mother rings, or mother-in-law rings or someone like that to see how I am because of some very negative press,' he told the radio show.

Local media reports suggests the new senator has been sidestepping questions about his party leader's controversial comments about China.

The Courier Mail in Queensland reports that Senator Lazarus has refused to respond to questions about Australia’s economic future, what his plans for the state were and the comments made by party leader Clive Palmer and fellow Senator Jacqui Lambie.

As a Senator, Glenn Lazarus, enjoys a base salary of more than $195,000 plus a raft of entitlements including travel.

It's been a tough initiation for one-time football great, heckled during his maiden speech, accused of going to ground by sections of the media and now this.

Also on Senator Lazarus's website, the words used to describe the role of the Senate and a member's role in it strike a remarkably close resemblance to the details provided on the site of South Australia's Independent Senator, Nick Xenophon.

The following are the second and third paragraphs on Senator Lazarus' website:

'Queensland is the largest state and the third most populated with a population of some 4,560,059 people. The capital and largest city in the state is Brisbane, Australia’s third largest city. Referred to as the ‘Sunshine State’, Queensland is home to 10 of Australia’s 30 largest cities and is the nation’s third largest economy.

The state was named in honour of Queen Victoria, who on 6 June 1859 signed Letters Patent separating the colony from New South Wales. The date 6 June is now celebrated state-wide as Queensland Day. Queen Victoria, who went on to become Britain’s longest reigning monarch, chose an eponymous name for the colony over Cooksland, which had been suggested by the influential local Presbyterian minister John Dunmore Lang in honour of navigator James Cook. Queensland achieved statehood with the Federation of Australia on 1 January 1901.'

Before entering politics in 2013 with the Palmer United Party, Glenn Lazarus (pictured playing for NSW against Queensland) enjoyed a stellar rugby league career, considered one of the code's greatest players

And the following are excerpts from Queensland - Wikipedia:

'Queensland (abbreviated as Qld) is the second-largest and third-most populous state in Australia.

'Queensland has a population of 4,560,059, concentrated along the coast and particularly in the state's South East.

'The capital and largest city in the state is Brisbane, Australia's third largest city.

'Referred to as the 'Sunshine State', Queensland is home to 10 of Australia's 30 largest cities and is the nation's third largest economy.

'The state was named in honour of Queen Victoria, who on 6 June 1859 signed Letters Patent separating the colony from New South Wales. The date 6 June is now celebrated state-wide as Queensland Day. Queen Victoria, who went on to become Britain's longest reigning monarch, chose an eponymous name for the colony over Cooksland, which had been suggested by the influential local Presbyterian minister John Dunmore Lang in honour of navigator James Cook. Queensland achieved statehood with the Federation of Australia on 1 January 1901.'

Apart from some re-ordering of sentences, there appears to be very little differentiation between the two pages. Reading further, there are arguably too many similarities to be a coincidence.

As the Queensland Wikipedia site appears today

The words on the Queensland page of the Glenn Lazarus site senatorlazarus.com strikes a remarkable resemblance to those on Wikipedia (top)

Senator Lazarus seems to be not backing down after the first real test of his political career, unlike his former football team-mate Mal Meninga.

Meninga, another rugby league great who starred for the Canberra side, is remembered for perhaps the country's most short-lived of political careers. In September 2001, just a few days after deciding he would run as an Independent in the ACT elections, he pulled out of the race while in his first political interview, saying quite simply: 'I'm buggered, I'm sorry. I have to resign'.
