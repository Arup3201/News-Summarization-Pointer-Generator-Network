Pope Francis has backed international military intervention to protect Christians driven from their homes by the Islamic State (IS) in Iraq.

The pope, who is visiting Korea this week, has written to the United Nations in an 'urgent appeal to the international community to take action to end the humanitarian tragedy now underway'.

This marks a departure from last year when he spoke against intervention in Syria saying 'You cannot end violence with violence'.

In a letter addressed to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, he wrote: 'The violent attacks that are sweeping across Northern Iraq cannot but awaken the consciences of all men and women of goodwill to concrete acts of solidarity by protecting those affected or threatened by violence and assuring the necessary and urgent assistance for the many displaced people as well as their safe return to their cities and their homes.'

Islamic State jihadists have unleashed a campaign of terror in Iraq by targeting religious minorities, forcing thousands from their homes, beheading prisoners and kidnapping women.

The letter added: 'The tragic experiences of the 20th Century, and the most basic understanding of human dignity, compels the international community, particularly through the norms and mechanisms of international law, to do all that it can to stop and to prevent further systematic violence against ethnic and religious minorities.'

Archbishop Tomasi, the Vatican observer at the UN, said the pope's use of word 'compel' meant there was 'a moral imperative, a necessity to act.'

He said we should not let the bloodshed become another 'Rwanda'.

He said: 'Every year when we commemorate the almost 1 million people killed in that genocide we make a kind of mea culpa saying we have not done anything effective to prevent the killing of those innocent people.

'God forbid that this may also be the same situation today.â€™

Francis held out an olive branch to China on Thursday when he sent greetings to the president as he became the first pontiff to cross into China's air space on his way to Korea.

The atheist state has had no diplomatic relations with the Vatican since the 1950s.

He also sent greetings to Vladimir Putin as he crossed Russia.
