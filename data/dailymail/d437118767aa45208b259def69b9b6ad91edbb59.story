Win: David Cameron pictured at the EU Budget summit at the European Council building in Brussels, has got his wish to see the EU budget cut

French president Francois Hollande dramatically snubbed David Cameron last night as Britain appeared on the brink of winning an historic battle for a real terms cut in the EU’s bloated budget.

The move from the socialist president, who is resisting budget cuts, came as it emerged profligate EU bureaucrats have awarded themselves pay rises worth an average of £3,000 a year.

In what was quickly dubbed ‘Le Sulk’ by diplomats, Mr Hollande caused astonishment at an EU summit by failing to turn up for talks with Mr Cameron, German leader Angela Merkel and European Council president Herman van Rompuy.

Mr Hollande claimed meetings with the leaders of other spendthrift nations – including Italy and Spain – had ‘overrun’ and did not appear for any of a scheduled hour-long discussion in Brussels.

Mr Hollande was said to be furious that Mr van Rompuy was on the point of agreeing to demands from Mr Cameron and Mrs Merkel for a significant cut in EU spending.

The Prime Minister has repeatedly threatened to veto a seven-year deal unless Brussels agrees to tighten its belt.

Rumours swept the summit that Mr van Rompuy was ready to agree to a budget ceiling of around £819billion – a cut of more than £60billion from his initial proposal of £881billion.

If approved, it would be the first time in the history of the EU that leaders have agreed to cut the budget. The EU’s last seven-year budget, which runs from 2007 to 2013, had a ceiling of £847billion.

Arriving for talks, the Prime Minister said: ‘Frankly, the European Union should not be immune from the sorts of pressures we’ve had to reduce spending, find efficiencies and make sure that we spend money wisely.’

He said the numbers on the previous proposal had been ‘far too high’, warning: ‘If they don’t come down, there won’t be a deal.’

Crucially, he has secured the support of Europe’s most powerful leader, Mrs Merkel, as well as the Dutch, the Swedish and the Finns.

But although Mr Cameron has targeted the pay and perks of the 50,000 EU officials, it also emerged that a longstanding levy on their salaries has been allowed to lapse.

It means they will now receive automatic windfalls worth an average of £3,000 a year – an increase of 4.47 per cent, and pushing the average pay past £70,000 for the first time.

Chris Howarth, senior political analyst at the Open Europe think-tank, said: ‘The EU budget negotiations have shown how difficult it is for member states to ask their taxpayers to continue to fund an unreformed EU civil service.

The Prime Minister, pictured with Finland's Prime Minister Jyrki Katainen said: 'Frankly, the European Union should not be immune from the sorts of pressures we've had to reduce spending, find efficiencies and make sure that we spend money wisely'

If member states are serious in reforming the EU budget, EU civil servants’ pay, allowances and tax privileges all need to be looked at.’

Eurosceptic MP Mark Pritchard, one of the Prime Minister’s harshest critics, who led a Commons revolt over EU spending, said: ‘If the PM comes back to the UK with a real terms cut in the EU Budget it will be a historic political achievement. He will deserve praise.’

However, the talks could be scuppered due to the demands of France, which is targeting Britain’s budget rebate, and Italy, which wants a higher overall EU budget to which it makes lower contributions.

Mr Hollande wants to slash the annual rebate for Britain won by Margaret Thatcher in 1984.

Tony Blair gave away a chunk of the rebate in 2005, in exchange for a promise of reform of agricultural subsidies that never materialised, but Mr Cameron has vowed to defend what remains to the hilt.
