Without Papiss Cisse, Newcastle would be bottom of the Premier League. Without Papiss Cisse, Alan Pardew probably wouldn’t be in a job.

And this, don’t forget, is the same Papiss Cisse with whom the management team had become disillusioned during his season-long struggle for form and fitness last time around.

They kept faith and, now, the future of Pardew and the club rests with their No 9.

Indeed, in scoring four goals from three matches already this season, he has doubled his league tally from the entirety of last term.

His point-saving braces – against Hull and now Swansea – mean Pardew will remain in charge until they face Leicester at St James’ Park a week on Saturday and almost certainly beyond.

United remain in the bottom three and without a win in seven, equalling their worst run from the outset of a Premier League campaign.

But Cisse has given his under-fire boss a timely lift. For no matter his declarations of ‘strength’ and ‘resilience’, the strain was beginning to show.

‘You need that player who can score under pressure and when you need one desperately – he did that twice,’ said Pardew, reflecting on Cisse’s close-range hook from an impossible angle and his poached finish to salvage a draw.

‘He gives us a real cutting edge. His first goal is top drawer, trust me. To score from that angle is very difficult. The second goal again was very good technique. To have him back and scoring goals is huge for us.

‘I can now hopefully look to the next game. It’s a massive chance to get a win and we’ve got to try and take that.’

Cisse’s goals cancelled out Wilfried Bony’s 17th-minute opener and former Magpie Wayne Routledge’s second-half dink which restored Swansea’s lead, and sent them momentarily to joint second.

Newcastle’s Senegal striker also netted twice during a 2-0 win at the Liberty Stadium in April, 2012 and that was in the midst of a run which included 11 in eight games.

But Cisse was making his first start on Saturday since breaking his kneecap in April, and insists he’s still some way off his free-scoring best.

‘For me I’m not “back, back”,’ he said. ‘I’m not on fire! I’m just working hard at the moment. I got an opportunity and I scored, I’m just doing my job.

‘But I need to do a lot more for this team, I need to get better. Two years ago I was like fire, scoring goals, but last year it wasn’t that way. That’s football. I need to keep going.’

Owner Mike Ashley was there to witness United’s comeback, but still there were calls for him and Pardew to go. One cutting protest banner read: ‘ LLWDLLLWWLWLLLLLLLLWLLDDLD’ – Not a Welsh Town, Our Form in 2014′.

And Cisse admitted: ‘It’s a very difficult time for the team. It’s three points we need. It’s not easy, it’s very hard at the moment.

‘The fans are not happy. The players need to believe in themselves and work hard, and it will come good. The Premier League is not easy. It’s not finished yet. We’re only a few games into the season, maybe it will turn.

‘This moment is not easy for the manager, and it’s not easy for the players too. It’s about belief and working hard and one day maybe we will come good.’

Cisse is certainly coming good for Pardew right now.
