Brazil 2014 has become the World Cup of 'Supersubs' - with goal after goal being scored by replacements.

The World Cup has come to life and, with so many late goals, it has been as exciting a tournament as anyone can remember - and even sub goalkeepers have contributed to the entertainment after Tim Krul's cameo in Holland's 4-3 penalty shoot-out victory over Costa Rica.

Here, Sportsmail takes a look at some of the best and most important goals from substitutes so far.

Subs: Even replacement goalkeepers have been the talk of the World Cup in Brazil

HARIS SEFEROVIC (Switzerland 2-1 Ecuador)

Trailing Ecuador 1-0 at half-time, Ottmar Hitzfeld brought on Mehmedi, who equalised straight after the break.

Hitzfeld repeated the trick when he brought on Haris Seferovic, who scored the winner three minutes into injury time.

JOHN BROOKS (Ghana 1-2 USA)

Clint Dempsey scored one minute into the USA’s campaign.

Andre Ayew equalised late on, but then, with four minutes left, substitute Brooks headed in from a corner to make himself an all-American hero.

MAROUANE FELLAINI (Belgium 2-1 Algeria)

Belgium boss Marc Wilmots used his subs effectively in Brazil. Losing 1-0 to Algeria, he brought on Fellaini, who equalised with a header off the bar, and Dries Mertens, who smashed home the winner with 10 minutes left.

KLAAS-JAN HUNTELAAR (Holland 2-1 Mexico)

The Dutch trailed Mexico with two minutes to go in their last-16 encounter.

Wesley Sneijder equalised, but it was substitute Huntelaar who buried a penalty in the last minute of injury time to send Holland through.

MEMPHIS DEPAY (Australia 2-3 HOLLAND)

After thumping Spain in their opener, Louis van Gaal’s Holland were struggling against an Australia side inspired by a thunderous Tim Cahill volley.

But substitute Depay saved the day with a late long-range strike.

ANDRE SCHURRLE (Germany 2-1 Algeria)

In another cagey last-16 game, Andre Schurrle came on at half time.

After a goalless 90 minutes, Schurrle’s sublime flick opened the scoring before he helped set up Mesut Ozil to put Germany into the next round.

ROMELU LUKAKU (Belgium 2-1 USA)

In one of the games of the tournament, Wilmots again changed the match.

He threw on Lukaku for extra time and the striker set up his side’s first and scored the second to send them into the quarter-finals.
