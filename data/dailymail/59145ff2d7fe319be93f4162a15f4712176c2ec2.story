Britain's Johanna Konta fell at the first hurdle in the US Open with defeat by Israel's Shahar Peer.

Konta secured a place at Flushing Meadows on her own ranking for the first time, but was unable to take advantage, losing 6-2 6-3.

At 118 in the world, Konta is ranked 37 places higher than Peer, but the Israeli has the pedigree, having once been the world number 11.

Solid: Peer may be ranked a lowly 155th in the world but she has experience and outclassed Konta

And Konta found Peer simply too steady, a tally of 15 winners and 34 unforced errors for the British number two rather telling its own story.

Konta had a chance to get back on serve in the second set when Peer slipped to 15-40 serving for the match, but she could not take advantage.

Konta was left cursing missed opportunities after taking just one of eight break points.

'It didn't go the way I wanted it to,' said the 23-year-old. 'I had my chances and I just wasn't able to capitalise on them. It was frustrating but she played tough in those points. I felt I gave it my best today and that's all I can do.

Unforced: The British woman made far too many mistakes, handing her opponent 24 free points in 17 games

'It's great being direct acceptance and I've very much enjoyed that here and at Wimbledon. But I definitely want to be getting deeper into these tournaments.

'I've had a lot of changes come my way this year, a lot of personal things. I just need to keep working hard and trust that the results will come.'

Konta was playing only her third match in more than a month after recovering from a right wrist problem.

She said: 'That's all fine now. It's my third match back so I need to get back into the swing of things. Hopefully that shouldn't take too long.'
