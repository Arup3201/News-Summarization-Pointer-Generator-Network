A man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering his girlfriend 37 years ago then changing his identity in a bid to escape justice.

Bruce McCullough, 66, was tracked down to San Diego, California, and arrested by police investigating the 1976 murder of Donna Smith in Tucson, Arizona.

The 20-year-old blonde was found dead inside the home they shared in March that year. She had been killed several days before her body was discovered, investigators said.

In the wake of Miss Smith's death, McCullough, who was 28 at the time, fled Tucson and assumed another identity, officials said.

A fugitive warrant was issued for his arrest, but the trail went cold.

Then, in January this year, murder detectives made a breakthrough when they learned that McCullough was using his old identity again and had been living in San Diego.

He was tracked down and arrested on May 2 and is now in custody pending extradition to Arizona, where he faces a charge of first-degree murder, NBC San Diego reports.

Detectives said they were able to visit Miss Smith's mother, who still lives in Tucson, and give her the news of McCullough's arrest.
