Nerve-racking footage has emerged of a suicide jumper being saved by police from plummeting to his death.

In the dashcam video, officer D. Mulvihill arrives to see an unidentified man teetering on the ledge of the Martin Luther King Boulevard overpass looking down on traffic below.

Using  tactics learned in training, Mulvhill carefully creeps up behind the man before suddenly grabbing him around the waist and hauling him to safety.

The jumper is momentarily distracted by sergeant McCoy, who starts walking towards him from another direction.

Together, the two policemen wrestle the man to the ground to prevent him from escaping.

They reassure him that he's 'OK' and everything's going to be 'alright'.

'You alright, buddy? I'm sorry. I'm just trying to help you. You're alright,' one of the officers can be heard saying. 

They then lift him back to two feet with a 'one, two, three' and escort him off the bridge.
