A former music industry executive was slashed with a machete on Sunday while being held hostage by his girlfriend's ex-husband, who slit his own wrists before being taken into custody.

Jerry Sharell, was cut several times on the neck and was rushed to the hospital in critical condition after the hours-long ordeal in Los Angeles, LAPD officer Sara Faden said. He was listed as stable on Monday.

Sharell worked with the Eagles, Linda Ronstadt, Queen and Motley Crue during a career as music executive dating back to the 1970s.

The hostage situation began about 8 a.m. Sunday at Sharell's home in the Woodland Hills area about 20 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, Faden said.

A neighbor told KCBS-TV that the suspect arrived on a motorcycle and pulled out a machete - and a bouquet of flowers - before entering the house and taking Sharell and his girlfriend hostage.

'He would ask a question and if he didn't like the answer, he'd cut the boyfriend on the neck,' said Sergeant Alex Kim.

After between three and five hours, the woman was able to get away and call police from a neighbor's home.

Arriving officers ordered the suspect to drop the machete. By the time he did, he had slit his own wrists.

'He asked his ex-wife to watch as he killed himself,' Sergent Jeff Nuttall told KCBS.

The suspect, 57-year-old Behnam Vasseghi of Woodland Hills, remained hospitalized Monday in stable condition, Faden said. He was expected in court Tuesday to face attempted murder charges.

The woman, who was not identified, was also injured during the struggle to get away and was treated at a hospital and released. She was pictured sitting at the crime scene with bloody bandages around her head and hands.

She had a restraining order against her former husband and had only recently started dating Sharell, police said. Sharell had also filed a restraining order against him on July 1.

Neighbor Harold Sulman saw the suspect drive up to Sharell's home on a motorcycle and pull out a bouquet of flowers, his wife told the New York Daily News.

'It's so terrifying. I left and came back during that time and had no idea. You just don't know what's going in another house,' Alice Sulman said.

'Jerry is just the nicest guy â€” so cute and adorable. His wife passed away about a year ago. We're all hoping Jerry makes a full recovery and this didn't affect his vocal chords. He has the smoothest voice.'

Sharell hosts the 'Sundays With Sinatra' program on Los Angeles radio station KJazz. He previously managed Asylum Records, worked in talent marketing at the radio network Westwood One, and headed video distribution at MCA, according to his bio on the KJazz website.
