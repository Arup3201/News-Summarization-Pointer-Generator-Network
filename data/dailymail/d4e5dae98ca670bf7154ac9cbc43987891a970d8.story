The picture apparently showing a big cat dubbed the Beast of Trowbridge was last night claimed to be a fake.

Although it certainly appears to be a black and furry four-legged beast, doubt has been cast over whether it really was photographed prowling near a certain Wiltshire town.

It emerged the photograph - possibly of a cougar - may have in fact been taken in Lapeer County, Michigan, in the US- and first published in 2007

Cat-ch me if you can: Herbert and Doreen Smith spotted this large feline in Trowbridge, Wiltshire

Brush with the beast: The couple were just feet away from what they believe could be the Beast of Trowbridge, a puma or panther spotted for years in the area

Herbert and Doreen Smith claim they 
saw the unusual animal while walking in Murhill Woods, in Trowbridge, 
Wiltshire last week and took the photo.

Mr Smith, 71, said they observed the animal catching and then eating some prey.

He said: 'Our first impression was sheer astonishment. We really could not believe our eyes at what we were seeing.

'The animal was eating what we believe it had just caught.

'There was a lot of rabbits about so I expect it was having breakfast.

'I was about 20ft away from it while it was eating. It looked up at me for a couple of seconds, then resumed eating.

Expert: Big Cat investigator Frank Tunbridge said it looked like a cross between a black leopard and a puma

'If it wasn't for my wife tugging at my arm to get me out of there, I would have stayed observing this magnificent animal.'

The
 Smiths are not the first to spot the creature which has been dubbed the
 'Beast of Trowbridge' by locals and there have been numerous sightings 
over the years.

Described as a puma or panther, the animal has also been seen in nearby Staverton and Westbury Leigh.

After
 looking at the pictures, Big cat tracking expert Frank Tunbridge said 
the animal looks like a cross between a black leopard and a puma.

He said: 'It is what we would call a British Big Cat.

'Looking
 at the curve of the tail it is very feline. Cats lay down to eat like 
that, unlike dogs or foxes which usually stand up.

'It
 is difficult to judge the size as there is very little in the photo to 
suggest proportions, but the couple who saw it certainly say they were 
shocked and presumably they would have known if it was just the size of a
 domestic cat.'

Mr Tunbridge, of Gloucester, added that it is entirely possible for big cats to survive in the UK.

'I go out into the field all the time and I know how they live.

'Big
 cats do not need antelopes or zebra to survive on. They can live off 
hares, rabbits, pheasants, moles, and of course there is plenty of those
 in our countryside.

'In
 the summer when there is plenty to eat, they survive on the smaller 
mammals, but in winter when there is less food around they will go for 
the bigger prey like deer.'

He
 said it is widely thought big cats came to roam the British countryside
 after they were released by people who bought them as pets in the 1960s
 and 70s.

'They were kept by the pop stars and models and people with money when there were no rules and regulations,' he said.

'When the Dangerous Animals Act came in in 1976, rather than have their pets destroyed they would take them out to the Cotswolds or the Forest of Dean or somewhere similar and just let them go.

'They bred and cross-bred after that.'

Sightings of the 'Beast of Trowbridge' have been reported for years, but there was a sudden flurry in 2009.

Chauffer Mark Jenner, 34, of Trowbridge, spotted what he believed was a big cat lurking by the side of a road between Bradford on Avon and Bath.

He told The Wiltshire Times: 'I could see these large reflective eyes and thick black coat, it was much larger than a cat.'

Den Owen, 39, of Trowbridge, also spotted the beast twice in the space of a week, while driving towards home.

At the time she said: 'It ran across the road like only a cat could. It had its back down and its tail out flat. It was around five and a half foot long and the height of a dog.”

Meanwhile Pamela Thomson, of Chapmanslade, claimed she had a close encounter with a big black cat six years ago in Westbury Leigh.

She took a photograph of the four-inch paw print it left on her car.

In another incident, songwriter Mike Booth, of Marlborough,told the newspaper that he saw a large cat crossing the road in front of him.

Also in 2009, shop worker Allyson Jones told how she came face to face with the big cat dubbed the 'Beast of Trowbridge'.

Miss Jones, 38, a beauty specialist, was driving on the B3107 between Bradford on Avon and Holt when she saw the beast in the path of her car.

She said: 'I thought it was going to eat me. It had just jumped out of a hedge and stood in the path of my car staring at me.

'It's eyes were red because of my headlights, which I then turned off because I know that with other animals, like deer, you turn your lights off and they run away.

'The cat ran away and headed in the direction of Trowbridge.'

Jim Holt, 52, from Trowbridge, also saw the beast.

He said: 'This cat ran out of the trees across the road and it was then that I saw this creature just looking out from the trees.

'It just lay there and stared. It is definitely a large cat-like creature from what I could tell.'

Rita Fielding, 73, of Bradford on Avon, spotted a big cat in 2010.

She said: 'I looked over and saw a massive black cat in some dead grass by the bank. I turned to tell my neighbour and it had gone by the time I looked back.

'What struck me is that it was so very very black and was much bigger than a dog.'

Meanwhile Jim Connor, 73, and his wife Anna, 71, have seen a panther-like creature in Trowbridge and Westbury.

He said: 'I've seen it walking up the drive in the middle of the night without a care in the world.'

THE WILDCAT OF WOODCHESTER

In January 2012, DNA tests were 
carried out on the carcasses of three roe deer found dead at Woodchester
 National Park, near Stroud, in a bid to establish how they were killed.

One
 of the deer had its vital organs missing and had had its snout severed -
 the hallmarks of a panther-like kill - but the tests found no evidence 
of a wild cat being involved.

Testing: A DNA test on 
the carcass of this deer did not prove the presence of a big cat, but experts said the attack had the hallmarks 
of a panther-like creature

In February 2012, a gigantic paw print was discovered in the hills around Bristol.

Barber Luigi Armato, 32, photographed the print on his mobile phone near the village of Binegar in the Mendip hills, while on a shooting trip with his father and brother.

Mr Armato, from Bristol, said the print was like nothing he had ever seen before - while wildlife experts said its size correlated with the paw of a big cat.  

The Avon Wildlife Trust said the prints are unlikely to be those of a fox - unless it was an extremely large one.

while on a trip in the Mendip Hills

The Mendips have been the site of several reported big cat sightings in recent years, and savaged carcasses discovered in the West Country added weight to claims that at least one giant beast is living there.

Also in February 2012, grainy film footage emerged online showing what appears to be a 6ft-long beast slinking across a field just three miles from Woodchester Park.

Teaching assistant Coryn Memory, who lives in the area, said she had spotted the large black animal - dubbed the 'Wildcat of Woodchester', five times before shooting the video.

She said her first sighting came in July 2009, when she saw the panther-like creature crossing a field near her house in Thrupp, near Stroud.

THE BEAST OF BODMIN MOOR

Evidence: A large cat skull, found in the River Fowey, on the edge of Bodmin Moor in 2005

One of the more famous big cats is 
the Beast of Bodmin Moor - over 60 sightings of a large black cat have 
occurred in the area over the years.

In 2005, a skull with large fangs and thought to be the remains of a big cat were found in the River Fowey close to the moor.

The skull was sent to the Natural History Museum in London for verification.

They determined that it was a genuine skull from a young male leopard, but also found that the cat had not died in Britain.

In fact, the skull had been imported as part of a leopard-skin rug.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food  conducted an official investigation into the 'beast' and other unknown animals reported to be roaming Britain in 1995.

It concluded there was no 'verifiable evidence' of exotic felines loose in Britain,.

But it also stated that the investigation could not prove that big cats were 'not present'.

THE BEAST OF NORTH NORTON

In July 2013, Sir Benjamin Slade claimed the beast had been on his land and that animals had been killed at the 98-acre Maunsel House.

One of his staff managed to take a picture of the purported animal.

Tom Baker, 25, the staff member who 
snapped the creature when he was putting out the rubbish at Maunsel 
House, said: ‘I saw something about 150 metres away and didn’t know if 
it was a deer, but it looked strange. I zoomed in and took the images.

‘It certainly looks like a big cat. I have no other explanation for it.’
