The mayor of a small town in Nottinghamshire is facing calls to quit after he moved 4,000 miles away to Saudi Arabia.

Kevin Thomas landed a new job just a month after he was chosen as mayor of Stapleford last May - a post for which he receives a £400-a-year allowance.

Since then he has been returning for one week a month and conducting  his civil duties over the phone, attending just 15 out of 41 events and sending his deputy to the rest.

Spinning plates: Kevin Thomas is still serving as the mayor of Stapleford, a town in Nottinghamshire, despite taking a new job 4,000 miles away in Saudi Arabia. He insisted he returns for one week every month

The Liberal Democrat mayor moved to the oil-rich Arab state's capital Riyadh with Working Links, a welfare-to-work firm with which he was an operations manager in the Midlands for five years.

Since then his deputy Ray Darby has been standing in at cheque presentations and school visits, as well as chairing council meetings in the town of 17,000 people.

Mr Thomas, 57, said he was planning to move back to England later this month.

He told the Nottingham Post he received 'daily e-mails' from the council's clerk with agendas, minutes and other council business. 

'At the time I was elected mayor, I did not know I was going to be working abroad,' he said. 'I was elected to represent the town and I can still do that from Saudi Arabia over the phone and via email.

'There are some months, especially in the summer, when nothing happens at the council. We also have a very good deputy mayor who attends events in my absence.' 

But news of the long-distance arrangement  sparked a row with residents calling for him to step down from his mayoral role, which ends in May.

Gulf: The huge distance between Mr Thomas' home and Saudi Arabia, where he is with a welfare-to-work firm

One voter, 40-year-old nurse Lisa Clarke, said: 'We want to be represented by people who live and work in the area. You want your town mayor to have a hands-on approach.'

Now the council is considering having to pay an extra allowance to his deputy, who would normally receive £100 for the year. Mr Darby admitted the situation was 'unfortunate'.

Yet town council leader Jackie Williams, also a Liberal Democrat, defended the mayor and said the criticism came from 'political meddling'.

'Of the 15 events he's attended they've been major events,' she told MailOnline.

'Whilst some of the 26 may have been significant a number of them will have been turning up to somebody's 90th birthday and giving them flowers.

Attack: One of Mr Thomas' colleagues said he had shown 'contempt for the people of Stapleford'

'A significant event would be something like the Hemlock Happening or the Stapleford Carnival, both of which he attended.

'He was chosen to be the mayor in May and the job opportunity came in June. It came out of the blue, these things happen sometimes and his company thought he was the best person for this particular job because it was something he's very good at.

'It's about to finish. My understanding was it would happen before Christmas but I believe he still has some loose ends to tie up.'

Ms Williams insisted the £400 allowance was crucial for  the high number of drinks and raffle tickets the mayor is expected to buy at town events.

'It's a non-story,' she said. 'We know who's raised this and it's political meddling because there's an election in May'. 

An independent councillor told MailOnline the situation was only revealed at a meeting after Mr Thomas had been in Saudi Arabia for several months.

Richard MacRae said: 'It's ridiculous. It's showing contempt for the people of Stapleford.

'He's a brilliant bloke when he's chairing meetings but the people of Stapleford deserve a mayor that's actually there for them.

'I brought the question up at the town council before, saying "why doesn't the mayor turn up to anything", and they just ummed and aahed.

'Recently we had a load of soldiers come back from fighting in Afghanistan and they marched through Beeston, a town just next to ours, and the mayor didn't turn up to that.

'We had the Christmas lights being turned on and the deputy stood in his place for that.'

Mr MacRae said the mayor should step down and give the £400 allowance to his deputy. 

'People want a councillor they can talk to face to face,' he added. 'If they have issues like a leaning lamp post or a mouldy flat they can't always do these things over the phone.'

Spot the difference: The mayor's tranquil home town of Stapleford, which has 17,000 inhabitants...

... And the mayor's new home Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia which has a population of almost 6million

A former serviceman, Liberal Democrat Mr Thomas joined the council in 2007 and stood for the larger Broxtowe Borough Council in 2011, but was beaten by two Labour candidates. 

Town councils, including Stapleford, are similar in size and set-up to parish councils.

Unlike the larger Broxtowe Borough Council which pays members more than £3,000 a year, councillors generally do not receive an allowance.

A Working Links spokesman said Mr Thomas was based in its Riyadh office and often travelled to the firm's other four Saudi offices in Jeddah, Dammam, Tabuk and Jizan.

A Stapleford Town Council spokesman said: 'It was agreed, following discussion with the Leader of the Town Council and the Deputy Town Mayor that should the need arise, the Deputy Town Mayor and/or Past Town Mayors would be able to attend Civic Events as requested.

'Stapleford Town Council has been appropriately represented throughout the current Civic Year and no invitations have been refused. Councillor Thomas has returned to the UK during this period and completed all his Council duties as required.

'Councillor Thomas will continue to serve as Town Mayor and attend Civic Engagements until the conclusion of his Civic Year.'

Despite the small scale of the council, Mr Thomas is not its first member to make headlines for moving away.

Husband and wife town councillors Brian and Christine Wombwell tried to continue their posts despite moving more than 100 miles away to Somerset in 2013.

Mrs Wombwell later stepped down, but her husband still represents the ward of Stapleton North.
