'Everyone's working together to try and find her. We love her and we want her to come home.'

Hundreds of local people yesterday met at a church to organise search parties and distribute flyers.

They had been asked to stay out of local woods so bloodhounds could try to pick up the missing girl's scent.

A signal from Autumn's phonecell was 
picked up by a phone tower in nearby Williamstown. Investigators believe
 the phone is now either switched off or has run out of power.

Michelle Connell whose daughter is a friend of Autumn's told NBC news: 'People have been out searching all day everywhere.

'All over town, every little park, railroad parks and school buildings. Every place we can think of.

'She's a good kid. She's a sweet girl. Everyone is upset.'
