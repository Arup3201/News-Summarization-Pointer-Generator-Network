Colombian football fans were rocked by the news that star striker Radamel Falcao will miss the forthcoming World Cup in Brazil.

National coach Jose Pekerman named his tournament squad on Monday evening during a press conference held in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Falcao, who suffered a serious knee injury when on duty for his club side Monaco in January, was left off the 23-man list, with Pekerman deciding he would not be ready.

The former Atletico Madrid frontman, who was a big-money signing by Monaco last summer, looked to have no hope of making his country's squad for the tournament in Brazil when he sustained the injury, however his recovery then progressed swiftly.

Pekerman said last week he would 'wait for Falcao until the last day, the last minute' before deciding on his fitness, after consulting with medical experts, and the final decision went against the 28-year-old.

'Muriel,
 Perea and Falcao are not going to be at the World Cup, Jose Pekerman 
has announced,' said a message on the national team's official Twitter 
account.

Colombia face Greece, Ivory Coast and Japan at Brazil 2014.

At a press conference in Buenos Aires, Falcao said: 'I had lots of hopes but, well, we've got to press on and support the team from the outside and wish all my team mates the best for a good World Cup.

'Today, I'm in very good shape but conscious that I still need a bit (more time) to play again and I didn't want to deny a place to a team mate who was 100 per cent fit, nor do something imprudent to damage my health.'

After taking the tough decision, Pekerman called it 'the saddest day I've had since becoming Colombia coach'.

Pekerman added: 'We can say to all of Colombia that 
he did more than was within his power to play. He 
deserved the right for us to wait and keep the hope alive.'

Atletico
 Madrid manager Diego Simeone tweeted: 'Most importantly your recovery 
as a professional. Football needs your talent and your passion. 
Embrace.'
