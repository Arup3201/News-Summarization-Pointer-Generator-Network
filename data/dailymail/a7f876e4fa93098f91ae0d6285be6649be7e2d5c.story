An angry shopkeeper made a woman accused of stealing from his clothing store sit in the window with a sign around her neck reading 'I'm a thief, I deserve to be beaten'.

After he reportedly caught the woman red-handed, owner Guo Hao declared he was fed up of thefts from his shop in the city of Wenzhou in east China's Zhejiang province and decided to make an example of her.

The 52-year-old then tied up the middle-aged woman and put her at the front of his store, placing the humiliating sign around her neck and ordering her to kneel on the floor and admit her crime.

He also took a photograph of her to deter other thieves, while instead of stepping in to help the woman, shoppers also grabbed their cameras and took pictures of the woman - many of which were uploaded to the internet.

The unrepentant shopkeeper kept the woman in his shop until a passerby eventually called the police.

Officers who arrived to take the woman into custody then warned the shopkeeper that taking the law into his own hands 
was illegal.

Action: As well as making her wear the sign, Guo ordered the woman to kneel on the floor and admit her crime

However, he is unlikely to get more than a slap on the wrist in China where harsh punishment for theft is not uncommon.

The
 incident has sparked heated debate in China, and although most of those
 who commented on the photographs seemed to approve of the shopkeeper's 
actions, others said it was unfair on the woman's family to see her 
humiliated in 
this way.

The woman was not named and police declined to say what had happened to her after she was taken into custody.
