Iain Duncan Smith yesterday insisted 
he would take ‘no bloody lessons’ from those calling for him to live on 
£53 a week, saying he had been on the breadline twice.

The Work and Pensions Secretary 
accused Labour and the BBC of fuelling a ‘stunt’ after he suggested in a
 radio interview that if necessary, he could get by on the amount a 
benefit claimant said he had to subsist on.

An online petition calling on Mr 
Duncan Smith to live for a year on £53 a week, which has been seized on 
by Labour MPs opposing cuts to the vast welfare budget, had last night 
attracted almost 300,000 signatures.

But the minister insisted yesterday 
that the Left had ‘lost the argument’ on reform of a welfare state that 
kept people ‘trapped into dependency’ and was now trying to ‘set up a 
stunt’.

He said he would not agree to the 
demands to show he could exist on the same income as market trader David
 Bennett because he had ‘been there, done that’.

‘I’m not going take any lectures from 
these people because the Left has opposed everything that we’ve done,’ 
Mr Duncan Smith told the Daily Mail. ‘What’s going on here is a campaign
 by the Left to distract from the reality of our changes. My personal 
details are quite simple. When I came out of the Army I was unemployed. I
 lived in a bedsit and I had to look for work.

‘I left the Army at 26, 27. I went off
 and did a heavy goods vehicle drivers’ course. I know what it’s like to
 live on a low income.

‘I didn’t claim unemployment benefit –
 I lived off the savings I had – but I went to the job centre. Later on 
in life when I worked my way up I was made redundant, I again had to 
start all over again from scratch and this time I had kids. I didn’t 
have any financial backing and I had to pick up the pieces, find another
 job and get back to work.

‘The honest truth is I don’t need any 
lessons from these people. I have worked hard all my life for what I’ve 
achieved and nobody has given me a damn penny. My earnings are what I 
live on.’

Mr Duncan Smith, who earns £134,000 a 
year and lives in a £2million Tudor country house with wife Betsy, a 
member of the aristocratic Fremantle family, said he had lost his job at
 a property company when interest rates soared after Black Wednesday in 
1992.

David Bennett, working on his market stall yesterday, challenged Iain Duncan Smith to live on £53 a week

‘The company literally stopped working
 and like a number of people I was made redundant. I was shocked, but I 
had to go home and tell my wife that the wheels had come off the bus,’ 
he said.

‘It took about three months to find a 
job. I picked up the paper every day, put a ring round all the job ads. I
 went to the library, looked up the stock market yearbook, wrote blind 
letters to people, used my Amstrad computer every day to look for work. 
Every bloody day I had to look for work. One of those blind letters got 
me in to an interview.

‘So I don’t need any lessons from 
people about living on a low income and making ends meet. I have done it
 twice and I know what it’s like to have to been made unemployed and to 
struggle. I’ve been there, done it.

‘I have never taken anything from 
anybody else. I’m proud enough to believe I get on and make my own 
bloody way in the world. I don’t believe in having anyone else do it for
 me.

‘That’s why I want to reform the 
system because it leaves people feeling helpless. This ridiculous 
nonsense is a stunt, and it’s a stunt to avoid the reality that we 
inherited a bust system – financially bust and morally bust.’

The Mail revealed yesterday that Mr 
Bennett, who challenged Mr Duncan Smith to live on £53 a week, is a 
regular gambler who lists his hobbies as ‘football, poker and beer’.

Tory MPs were furious the BBC allowed 
him to confront the Work and Pensions Secretary apparently without 
making the most cursory checks on his income, which is nearer £150 a 
week.

Conservative MP for Esher, Dominic 
Raab, wrote to new BBC director-general Lord Hall, saying he was 
concerned that the interview with Mr Bennett not only lacked accuracy 
but ‘may well have failed in its duty of care towards Mr Bennett’.

‘What background checks were made by 
the BBC to ensure the veracity of Mr Bennett’s claims?’ he asked. ‘Mr 
Bennett claims that he “put a comment on [the BBC website] saying David 
Cameron can stick his Big Society where the sun doesn’t shine”. Why did 
the BBC not take this as an indication that his claims merited deeper 
examination?

‘The BBC has persistently used highly politicised and partisan language in its coverage of the Government’s welfare reforms.’

Chancellor George Osborne said 
yesterday: ‘I don’t think it’s sensible to reduce this debate to an 
argument about one individual’s set of circumstances.

‘We have a welfare system where there 
are actually lots of benefits available to people on very low incomes, 
there’s jobseeker’s allowance, income support, working tax credit, 
council tax benefit, housing benefit, if they have children, child tax 
credit.

‘What this debate is about, it’s not 
about any individual, it’s about creating a welfare system that rewards 
work, supports people who do the right thing, helps people who want to 
get on in life and has a regard for the many millions of people who work
 hard and pay their taxes and expect them to be well spent.’

Mr Duncan Smith once stayed on a tough housing estate for a Channel 4 documentary.
