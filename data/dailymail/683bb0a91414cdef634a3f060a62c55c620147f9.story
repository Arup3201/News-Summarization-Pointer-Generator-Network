It's hard to know whether to laugh or cry but authorities in Kenner, Louisiana have arrested a couple accused of dealing cocaine and prescription drugs.

It wasn't hard for detectives to spot John Adams Jr., 33, with his distinctive tattoos in place of his eyebrows.

His partner, America Villasenor, 28, was also arrested after police issued a search warrant at their home earlier this week.

As Villasenor answered the door, she tried to block investigators from entering the master bedroom telling detectives only she and her three young children were home, two 6-year-olds and an 18-month-old.

She was lying, however, as police found Adams in the bathroom flushing cocaine down the toilet.

Investigators found several one-gallons bags.

Police say Adams resisted arrest, punching two officers before they could handcuff him.

A search of the residence and a 
vehicle turned up more cocaine as well as several prescription drugs, 
including the painkillers oxycodone and hydrocodone; alprazolam, an 
anti-anxiety medication; cephalexin, a powerful antibiotic; and 
amitriptyline, an anti-depressant.

Detectives also found a hydraulic press for repackaging cocaine, plastic bags and a digital scale.

Adams
was booked with drug possession with the intent to distribute, crack 
possession, possession or distribution of drugs without a prescription, p
obstruction of justice, three counts of cruelty to a juvenile, 
resisting an officer and two counts of battery of a police officer.

He is being held on a $289,000 bond at the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center in Gretna, Louisiana.

His partner, Villasenor, was also booked on similar charges.
