A teenager accused of plotting a Columbine-inspired massacre has escaped terror charges after a second Old Bailey jury could not reach a verdict.

Michael Piggin, 18, outlined detailed plans of deadly attacks on two schools, the local mosque, council offices and Loughborough University in his diaries.

But two successive juries could not decide whether he was guilty or not and defendants are never tried for third time.

The A-level student, now 18, wrote about arming himself with guns, bombs, and knives in a deadly assault inspired by Anders Breivik.

Verdict: Michael Piggin, 18, who wrote about planning a Columbine-inspired massacre, has escaped terror charges after two Old Bailey juries could not decide whether he was guilty or not guilty

Room: This is Michael Piggin's room which features posters of a swastika and the Joker from Batman

But he claimed the details of his ‘Operation’ were a way of venting his anger rather than serious plans.

Prosecutor Gareth Patterson said: ‘If this jury cannot return verdicts that will be the conclusion of the proceedings.’

Piggin was cleared of preparing an act of terrorism and other terror offences.

He admitted possessing a knife and confessed to possessing parts for an improvised explosive device halfway through the trial. He will be sentenced for those charges on June 13.

The teenager’s bedroom floor was littered with knives, air guns, a machete, and a crossbow, while a Nazi swastika flag took pride of place on his wall.

Piggin built pipe bombs, smoke 
grenades and improvised explosives in his bedroom and tested Molotov 
cocktails behind the local leisure centre.

He
 was arrested after brandishing a knife at a young boy and threatening 
to stab him for throwing an empty drinks can at him in Loughborough town
 centre.

Other charges: He admitted possessing a knife and parts for an improvised explosive device halfway through the trial

The teenager, who has Asperger’s Syndrome, denied he had been plotting terrorist acts and said his diary entries were not serious.

His lawyers claimed he had been just ‘retreating into fantasy.’

Piggin was charged with possessing an article for a purpose connected with terrorism, and possessing a document likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism.

He pleaded guilty to possessing an offensive weapon and possessing an article for a purpose connected with terrorism.

Two of Piggin’s best friend were each sentenced to community orders last year after they admitted possessing petrol bombs and pipe bomb parts before the trial began.

The 18-year-old boys from Loughborough cannot be named because of an ongoing legal battle to grant them life-long anonymity.
