An Instagram fitness star known for her noticeably round derriere, has landed a lucrative sports management deal and is being dubbed the 'next Jillian Michaels.'

Jen Selter, 20, from New York City, has amassed more than two million followers on her social media account, after posting daily poses of herself working out in tight-fitting gym gear - her shapely bottom being the primary focus.

The pretty brunette is now tipped to make a small fortune through product endorsements and public appearances. Book, TV and fitness video projects are also in the pipeline.

The squats paid off! Instagram fitness star Jen Selter , who known for her noticeably round derriere, has landed a lucrative sports management deal and is being dubbed 'the next Jillian Michaels'

Selter signed with The Legacy Agency, 
which represents baseball stars Carl Crawford and ­Johan Santana, NFL 
players Osi Umenyiora and Reggie Bush and sports broadcasters Troy 
Aikman and Dan Hicks.

'We believe she can be the next Jillian Michaels,' TLA agent Andrew Witlieb told the New York Post, even though Selter, has no formal fitness training like Michaels, 39, who is a judge on NBC’s The Biggest Loser.

Famous asset: The 20-year-old from New York, has amassed more than two million followers on Instagram after posing pictures of her pert behind

However, Witlieb pointed out: 'Jillian didn’t get to where she is until 
her mid-30s. Jen’s going to grow as a person, as a fitness expert, in 
these next years. She’s here for the long term.'

Asked if Selter’s precious rear would be insured like the limbs of other top athletes, Witlieb added, 'I have no idea.'

Just
 one picture of Selter on a workout ball or squatting at the gym can garner
 as many as 80,000 likes, and thousands consider her a fitness 
inspiration.

'I'm recognized wherever I am,' Selter said. 'I don't really go to public gyms anymore 
just because it is a whole big scene when I'm there. I 
don't like being watched.'

Naturally sculpted: Many followers have suggested her plump derriere is fake - but she insists it is real, explaining that the only cosmetic surgery she has undergone was a nose job as a teenager

Sowing them how it's done: She says she aims to be an inspiration for other people to get fit

Active: Selter, originally from Long Island, is also a spokeswoman for a nutrition supplement company and hopes to launch her own line of workout gear

She admits that her 
photos are always focused on her rounded behind, explaining: 'I don't 
really post a lot of face pictures... They don't want to see my face.'

Selter,
 who is single and lives with her mother on the Upper West Side, took 
cosmetology classes while holding side jobs at a plastic surgeon's 
office and a gym after graduating high school.

'I'm recognized wherever I am, I don't really go to public gyms anymore 
just because it is a whole big scene when I'm there. I 
don't like being watched'

When
 she started working out at the gym, she noticed that her behind began 
getting bigger and was inspired by the transformation.

She
 joined Instagram in March 2012 and began posting images of her body. 
When she saw people reposting her images, she asked for a credit and her
 number of followers boomed. 

Once she achieved 300,000 followers, 
sponsorship offers piled up from companies including Nike, Lululemon and
 New Balance, among others.

She has since quit her gym job and secured deals with water company NY20 and a nutrition supplement company, Game Plan Nutrition, for which she is a spokeswoman.

Stunning: Selter, who is single, says she struggles to go anywhere where she is not recognized

Proud: She says that while she has worked hard to achieve her behind, anyone can do it

While
 she would not reveal how much she makes from these deals, Selter, who 
did not go to college, said they give her 'a lot more money than a 
graduate would be making'.

Her mother, Jill Weinstein, said she couldn't be more proud of her daughter and her following.

'I'm
 very proud of her because this is a girl who didn’t want to go to 
college, and she was able to build up this social media in such a way 
that she has become famous and she is an inspiration and motivation for 
so many people,' she told the Post.

Many followers have suggested her 
plump derriere is fake - but she insists it is real, explaining that the
 only cosmetic surgery she has undergone was a nose job as a teenager.

Curvy: Selter worked in a gym until she amassed half a million followers and began getting other job offers

Close: Selter is pictured with her mother Jill, who said she is proud of how her daughter motivates others

'I'm Jewish,' she said. 'Jewish girls have big noses. Probably 1 out of 3 girls I know [has] a nose job.'

Selter,
 who hopes to create a line of workout gear or even her own chain of 
gyms, admits that some of the photos can be 'showy' - but said that she 
simply wants to inspire people.

'I
 see myself motivating and inspiring everyone around the world,' she 
told the Post. 'With hard work and dedication, anyone can get to where I
 am.'

She is set to make her first public appearance since signing with The Legacy Agency at Super Bowl events next week.
