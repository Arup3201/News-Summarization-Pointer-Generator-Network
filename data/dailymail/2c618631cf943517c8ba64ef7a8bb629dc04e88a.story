Along with asking her age, prodding a woman as to what's inside her handbag is considered one of the most forward things you can ever ask a lady.

Nonetheless, the Countess of Wessex was more than happy to tell - and even show - one inquisitive six-year-old what was inside hers during a visit to the charity PACT, Parents and Children Together, at Dorchester Abbey in Oxfordshire today.

When little Nicheala asked the
 countess what was inside her tiny red baguette clutch, Sophie began to
 take out the contents, revealing an assortment of make-up and face 
creams, including some Trish McEvoy products.

Sophie, wife of Prince Edward, was visiting the centre to help bury a century time capsule containing items collected from PACT projects, celebrating 100 years of the charity and highlighting 
the important work it does for adoption and fostering within the 
community.

Looking elegant in a cream, knee-length belted coat with a pinched waist, and brown leather boots, Sophie happily dug the hole for the capsule and dropped it in.

As well as conducting the burial (and 
having a girly chat about beauty products with little Nicheala), Sophie 
attended a ceremony at Dorchester Abbey for the charity which endeavours
 to find homes for children in care in the south-east.

Speaking to Royal Central before her visit, PACT's chief executive Jan Fishwisk said: 'We are thrilled and honoured that HRH 
The Countess of Wessex will be visiting us at Dorchester Abbey for this 
exciting occasion.

'The time capsule will serve as a record of our work so far and a celebration of all we have achieved.'

The mother-of-two also spent yesterday with children when she visited the Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) clinic at St Thomas's Hospital in London.

As Patron of the Charity DEBRA, the national charity that supports individuals and families affected by EB, the countess visited the clinic to meet patients, families and staff.

EB is a rare condition that causes skin to break and blister at the slightest touch.
