Carol Thatcher said yesterday that she was expecting a ‘tough and tearful week’ as she prepared for her mother’s funeral.

Speaking outside the family home in Belgravia, Central London, Margaret Thatcher’s daughter said she felt ‘like anyone else who has just lost a second parent’.

But dressed in a black shawl, black trousers and clutching a pair of sunglasses, Ms Thatcher made clear she had found comfort in the messages of sympathy and support.

'Tough and tearful': Carol Thatcher made the poignant comment to media 
gathered outside the family home in Chester Square, London

Grateful: Miss Thatcher, 59, whose twin brother Mark can be seen standing behind, thanked well-wishers for their outpouring of sympathy and support

Giving an ‘enormous personal thank 
you’ for those messages, she said: ‘These have given me strength. But I 
know this is going to be a tough and tearful week, even for the daughter
 of the Iron Lady.’

Ms Thatcher hailed the ‘magnificent 
tributes’ from world leaders, including US President Barack Obama, as 
proof that her mother’s place in history was assured.

‘I would like to say that I feel like
 anyone else who has just lost a second parent. It’s a deeply sad and 
rather thought-provoking moment in life.

‘My mother once said to me: “Carol, I think my place in history is assured.”

‘The magnificent tributes this week, 
the wonderful words of President Obama, and the others of colleagues who
 once worked alongside her, have proved her right.’

Miss Thatcher, 59, made the poignant 
remark to reporters and thanked well-wishers for their outpouring of 
sympathy and support since Baroness Thatcher's death on Monday.

She said it had given her strength in the days before Wednesday's funeral for the former prime minister at St Paul's Cathedral.

Meanwhile, programming chiefs at ITV 
rejected plans for a news special to provide full coverage of Lady 
Thatcher’s funeral, opting instead for it to be covered through This Morning.

Journalists at the broadcaster were 
dismayed to learn that Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield will be 
used as a link to the funeral as they present their popular daytime 
show.

According to sources, Alastair Stewart
 and Julie Etchingham had been lined up to present if the broadcaster 
had agreed to traditional live coverage on Wednesday. Now Miss 
Willoughby, 32,  and Mr Schofield will link to Mr Stewart to provide 
‘live updates’.

In comparison, the BBC will  provide 
more heavyweight  coverage through veteran  presenter David Dimbleby, 
who will front a three-hour special.

ITV insiders say proposals for a 
special programme fronted by its journalists were rejected because of 
the cost, understood to be in the region of £500,000.

One reporter on ITV News said: ‘There is always disappointment when you are leaving full coverage to others.’

Meanwhile it has been reported that Italy premier Silvio Berlusconi will not be attending the funeral, despite a concerted effort to gain an invitation.

Mr Berlusconi’s office made ‘numerous 
and insistent’ phone calls to the Italian embassy in London, but acting 
prime minister Mario Monti will represent Italy.

Funeral arrangements: Baroness Thatcher will receive a ceremonial funeral with military honours at St Paul's Cathedral on Wednesday

Statement: Baroness Thatcher, who was Britain's first and only female prime minister, died at the Ritz on Monday at the age of 87
