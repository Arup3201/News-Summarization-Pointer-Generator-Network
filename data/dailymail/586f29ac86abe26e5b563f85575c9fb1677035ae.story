There are renewed calls for a federal ICAC as Australia slips out of the world's top 10 nations known for their squeaky clean public sectors.

Transparency International says Australia has fallen for the third straight year in its global Corruption Perceptions Index, dropping from an impressive ranking of seven in 2012 to 11 in 2014.

Australia slipped out of the top 10 for just the second time in the index's 20-year history.

Transparency International Australia director Professor A.J. Brown said the drop was 'of great concern'

The annual index measures expert and business opinion of public sector corruption across 175 countries.

'This is a real and significant drop which is of great concern,' Transparency International Australia director Professor A.J. Brown told reporters in Sydney.

He said the results indicated a concern about the effectiveness of corruption fighting bodies like the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption that recently exposed alleged rorting of donations laws by Liberal MPs.

'There are questions as to whether the ICAC has the right prosecution follow-up powers,' he said.

'Our assessment is that it's not simply a question of more scandals ... the slide shows growing concern about the adequacy of responses to corruption risks, especially at the federal level.'

Prof Brown said Australia's position would get worse if no action was taken on introducing a federal anti-corruption body.

Major scandals this year included the prosecutions of Reserve Bank note-printing subsidiaries, allegations of widespread union corruption and the ICAC's probe into alleged systemic rorting of political donation laws by Liberal NSW MPs.

The ICAC said in November former state Labor ministers Eddie Obeid and Ian Macdonald would be prosecuted over adverse corruption findings.

Denmark and New Zealand were ranked as the top two cleanest countries in the world, while North Korea and Somalia were perceived to be most corrupt.
