Two men allegedly operating a Mexican cartel out of Sydney's beachside suburb of Manly were held up at gunpoint by police in dramatic scenes on Friday.

Federico Gonzalez Magana and Juan Vergara Rodriguez have been charged with possession of $30 million worth of drugs thought to be crystal methamphetamine.

The Mexican nationals share the same address and fronted Parramatta Bail Court via video link on Saturday, communicating through a Spanish translator, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Bail for the pair was refused. They will reappear again in Central Local Court on Wednesday.

Two alleged Mexican drug dealers were held up at gunpoint in dramatic scenes in Sydney on Friday night

The 49-year-old and a 32-year-old were arrested on Military Road in Neutral Bay, in Sydney's Lower North Shore, in front of school children who filmed the incident after heavily armed police stopped traffic and surrounded their car.

Vergara-Rodriguez and Gonzalez-Magama were pulled from a red vehicle, handcuffed and lined up against a shop window.

Police said the drugs seized represent 300,000 street deals of meth and the men are allegedly part of a Mexican cartel targeting Australia.

Australian Federal Police (AFP) members searched properties in Manly, Pennant Hills and Moore Park and found about 30 kilograms of a substance believed to be crystal meth.

They also discovered about two guns and $2 million in Australian cash, suspected to be the proceeds of crime.

The men have been charged with drug possession and dealing in the proceeds of crime

The men have been charged with drug possession and dealing in the proceeds of crime, following a joint investigation between the AFP and the Australian Crime Commission (ACC).

ACC National Manager Investigations Richard Grant said: 'This is a drug that is ruining lives, wrecking careers and pulling apart families.'

'The ACC and AFP are serious about removing these drugs from our streets, and we will continue to work together to stop organised crime groups from harming the Australian population.'

Police said they were arrested after they were supplied with intelligence by the ACC through its Eligo National Task Force, which is tracking illicit money flows in the country.

AFP Manager Serious and Organised Crime Commander Scott Lee said the operation was a result of close cooperation and intelligence sharing between the AFP and the ACC.

'This joint-agency operation is testament to our combined determination to stopping criminals from profiting from the importation of drugs into Australia', Commander Lee said.

Both men were charged with possessing a commercial quantity of border controlled drugs reasonably suspected of having been imported, and dealing in money reasonably suspected to be proceeds of crime.

The maximum penalty for these offences is life imprisonment.

Forensic tests are being carried out to confirm the exact weight and purity of the drugs seized, police said.
