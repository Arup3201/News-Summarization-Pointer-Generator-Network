They're known for being one of the most rancid-smelling animals and would seem to be the most unlikely of pets.

But Deborah Cipriani keeps 50 of the animals in her own home; they are given free reign of the five-bedroom house - even sleeping on Deborah's bed.

The 55-year-old, from North Ridgeville, Ohio, runs America's only rescue centre for domestic skunks.

Devoted: Deborah Cipriani says skunks are loveable and devoted pets and keeps 50 of them in her home

Rescued: The 55-year-old, from North Ridgeville, Ohio, runs America's only rescue centre for domestic skunks and offers them free reign of her own home

Deborah, who is a customer service worker, said: 'A lot of people think we're weird to like pet skunks and they always say, "Why do you want a pet skunk" and I ask them "Why do you want a pet dog?"

'It's the same reason - skunks can be loveable, devoted animals.'

She added: 'I have a lot of skunks in the house, they've all got different personalities.

'Some are nice, some are not. Some want to sleep on the bed, some don't.

'But, no matter what the issue is, we treat them all like family.'

Full-time job: Mrs Cirpriani spends three hours every morning and evening cleaning the foul-smelling creatures which roam her five-bedroom house

Deborah, who lives with partner Kevin, 51, bought her first skunk in 2000 to help her through the death of her mother.

Since then, she's become so attached to the animals that she's dedicated her life to caring for them - getting up at 4.30am every morning to make sure they're all fed in time.

She said: 'I have to get up early to start the daily routine of feeding and cleaning every single skunk in the house - that takes three hours alone.

'I then go to work and when I'm home at the end of the day the routine starts all over again.

'It's tiring but it all the running around has actually made me much healthier. If I didn't have so many skunks I wouldn't be so limber and so energetic.'

Every year she hosts 'Skunk Fest' for skunk fans from across the country to parade their pets in a 'beauty pageant'

On show: The smelly animals are paraded around on a lead; some are even pushed in prams

Since 2000, her home, called Skunk Haven, has become well known throughout America and she even has fans in the UK, France and the Netherlands.

Deborah has set up her own event - called Skunk Fest - which attracts fellow animal lovers from all over America every September.

The bizarre day includes a beauty pageant for skunks and an award for 'best dressed'.

Doting owners walk their pets around on leads; some push them in prams.

Deborah said: 'The Skunk Fest is awesome. What we want to do is help the public see skunks in a different light.

Tolerant: Partner Kevin is tolerant is Deborah's passion for skunks, which have helped her get over the death of her mother

Dedicated: Since she adopted her first skunk in 2000, she has now amassed 50 of the animals and has devoted her life to caring for them

Chosen one: Deborah said she feels she was chosen to help the skunks and will keep doing so until she dies

'The animals have a bad reputation because of their smell but what we want to do is change perceptions.

'Because skunks aren't the smelly little creatures that people think they are - they're wonderful, beautiful animals.'

She added: 'I feel that I was chosen to help the skunks and I will keep doing this and I will own skunks until I die.'
