This tram wouldn’t look out of place in Gotham City, but instead it is destined to transport visitors around Russia during the 2018 World Cup.

The Russia One (R1) tram prototype was designed by tank and train maker Uralvagonzavod (UVZ) and is fitted with Wi-Fi, GPS, seven HD-CCTV cameras, air-conditioning, anti-bacterial handrails.

The tram can hold between 190 and 270 passengers and travels at an average speed of 14mph (24 km/h).

The R1 tram, officially known as the 71-410 car, was unveiled during the Innoprom 2014 conference in Ekaterinburg.

It was based on UVZ’s current 71-409 model car, but with improved performance and a completely new exterior and interior design.

Alexey Maslov, chief executive of UVZ, described the train as a crystal in a metal shell and an 'iPhone on rails' designed to fit into any landscape.

The overhanging cabin nose is another innovative feature which gives the driver a 30 per cent wider view, minimising the risk of running over pedestrians.

‘We are speaking of introducing UVZ to international markets, such as Eastern Europe, and South America,’ said Mr Maslov.

‘This tram can easily operate in Melbourne. We compete with world leaders such as Alstom (France) and Bombardier (Canada), keeping in mind their latest designs.’

While R1 is still a prototype, Mr Maslov claims that they could begin mass production next year.

These trams are expected to run in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhy Novgorod, Yekaterinburg and Volgograd.

There is also a plan to develop a new tram that will run underground, using a similar concept to R1.

‘Putting aside false modesty, I can say that we are at least within the competition. It’s a project of a great rarity for Russian market,' said Mr Maslov.
