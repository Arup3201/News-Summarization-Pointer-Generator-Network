Nigel Farage was caught in a war of words with Scottish nationalists last night after he accused them of being ‘fascist scum’.

The UK Independence Party leader said the left-wing extremists who trapped him in an Edinburgh pub were the ‘ugly face of Scottish nationalism’ pursuing an anti-English agenda.

He challenged Scotland’s first minister Alex Salmond to condemn the protesters who had chanted ‘Nazi, Nazi’, jostled him and told him to ‘go back to England’.

Mr Farage also hit out at the BBC after a Radio Scotland presenter appeared to question his right to debate Scottish issues.

In the extraordinary scenes on Thursday night the police forced Mr Farage to take refuge in the Canons’ Gait pub on Edinburgh’s Royal Mile for his own safety after the mob of supposedly anti-racist protesters launched the hostile demonstration against him, preventing him from leaving a press conference.

Dozens of activists from the Radical Independence group, most of them students, had gathered on the street outside the press conference, where a giant ‘Vote Yes for Scotland’ banner was held up.Offensive chants included ‘you can stick your Union Jack up your a***’ and ‘go back to England, you’re not welcome here’.

The Radical Independence group is not formally linked to the Scottish National Party, but Mr Farage suggested ‘elements’ of the SNP had the same anti-English views. He said: ‘It was a demonstration dressed up as being anti-racism but in fact in itself was deeply racist, with a total hatred of the English and a desire for Scotland to be independent from Westminster.

‘My goodness me, if this is the face of Scottish nationalism it’s a pretty ugly picture.

‘The anger, the snarling, the shouting, the swearing was all linked in to a desire for the Union Jack to be burnt and extinguished from Scotland forever.

‘I must say I have heard before that there are some parts of Scottish nationalism that are akin to fascism but yesterday I saw that face to face.’

Mr Farage hung up the phone on his BBC Radio Scotland interview after a presenter asked him to ‘remind me how many elected representatives you have in Scotland’.He replied: ‘Absolutely none. But rather more than the BBC do.

‘We could have had this interview in England a couple of years ago, although I wouldn’t have met with such hatred that I’m getting from your questions, and frankly I’ve had enough of this interview. Goodbye.’

Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie described Mr Farage’s treatment as an ‘attack on free speech’ and urged Mr Salmond to condemn it.

‘We’ve always known that supporters of independence can be very passionate for their cause but the offensive and aggressive behaviour toward Nigel Farage was unacceptable,’ he said.

A second opinion poll has put UKIP on 18 per cent.

The latest survey by TNS BMRB found support was at the same level as the party's all-time high recorded by Ipsos MORI this week.

Labour’s
 lead over the Conservatives was trimmed to nine points, with Mr 
Miliband’s party falling three points to 37 per cent and Mr Cameron’s 
Tories gaining three to 28 per cent.

The Lib Dems are on just seven per cent.

‘Of course I disagree with Nigel Farage on his unpleasant and dishonest agenda but he will be defeated by argument not aggression.

‘It was deeply ironic when these self-proclaimed anti-racist campaigners told an Englishman to get back to his own country. Anti-racists turned racist but were too ignorant to notice. I am sure most people in Scotland will be appalled at this behaviour.’

George Galloway, the Respect Party MP, said the protest was bad for Scotland.

In a message on Twitter he said: ‘Events in Edinburgh yesterday forcing the evacuation of Nigel Farage were a pure embarrassment for Scotland. And the shape of things to come.’The Yes Scotland campaign which is pushing for independence in next year’s referendum on Scotland’s future, distanced itself from the ugly protests.

A spokesman said: ‘Yes Scotland continues to run a positive campaign and we condemn any and all forms of intimidation.’ But the SNP said Mr Farage had ‘lost the plot’.

Mr Salmond, who leads the Scottish Nationalist Party, claimed Mr Farage knew ‘absolutely nothing’ about matters north of the border.

He added: ‘This is a man who doesn’t like getting challenged because when the obnoxious views of his party are put to him then his bubble deflates very quickly and that is what we saw in his panicky interview this morning.’

Lothian and Borders Police confirmed two men were arrested for assault and breach of the peace at Thursday’s protest.

One revealed on Twitter that he is English, and criticised Mr Farage for branding yesterday’s protest ‘anti-English’. He said: ‘As a proud Englishman, arrested yesterday for protesting, I dispute these claims.’

Liam O’Hare of the Radical Independence group also defended the protest, saying: ‘Our protest was to make it clear that UKIP’s rise in England is in no way reflective of Scotland.’UKIP has never made a breakthrough in Scotland, receiving just 0.91 per cent of the regional vote in the 2011 Holyrood election.

But Mr Farage said he was confident the party would win get its first MEP in Scotland in next year’s European Parliament elections.

The mobbing of Nigel Farage by extreme left nationalists in Edinburgh has exposed to the rest of Britain what the UKIP leader calls the ‘ugly face’ of Scottish separatism.

Even though members of hard-left activist groups are seldom the brightest bulbs on the chandelier, the fact they could abuse Farage as a ‘racist’ while simultaneously shouting at him to ‘Go back to England’ – without any conscious irony – says it all.

While it should be emphasised that there are many thousands of decent Scots who have embraced the separatist agenda without harbouring any animosity towards English people, it is an inescapable fact that a significant element within the nationalist movement is motivated by anti-English sentiment.

He had to be taken away in a police van after a taxi was blocked by the crowd

This bigotry was aggravated in the 1990s by the film Braveheart which, though historical hokum, provoked an emotional response among many young people that has not evaporated even today.

The aggressive ‘Cybernats’ – embittered nationalists who pour out bile on the internet and in the Twittersphere – are the spearhead of a movement that, in any other ethnic context, would be called racist.

A Scottish Government report five months ago recorded a 23 per cent increase in the number of white British people targeted as victims of racial crime.

The figures were not broken down into the component nations of the UK, but few of them are likely to have been Welsh. Even allowing for anti-Irish sentiment, it is clear that anti-English abuse is on the rise.

Nor is this shameful prejudice confined to the Agitprop rentamob that attacked Mr Farage. Last December, Scottish writer Alasdair Gray provoked outrage when he denounced English ‘colonists’ in the Scottish arts world.

One of those ‘colonists’, Vicky Featherstone, who had presided over the establishment of the National Theatre of Scotland and promoted successful plays such as Black Watch, revealed when she left to take up a new post at the Royal Court Theatre that, throughout her time in Scotland, anti-English bullying had made her feel ‘paralysed’ artistically.

Troubled waters: Controversy has continued to follow Farage

The passions aroused by the rise of the SNP and the drawn-out ‘neverendum’ campaign on independence have had an unhealthy effect on Scottish society.

Although the mob that threatened Mr Farage and broke up his press conference was not drawn from the SNP, Alex Salmond’s party cannot plausibly disown these thugs, from an extreme left group known as Radical Independence. At the launch of the Yes Scotland campaign for the independence referendum in Glasgow on January 16, Nicola Sturgeon, deputy first minister of Scotland, shared a platform with Cat Boyd, of Radical Independence, along with other assorted leftists.

Words do not come more weasel than the terms in which Alex Salmond responded to the question of whether he condemned the intimidation of Mr Farage.

Despite two arrests and damning video footage, the first minister said: ‘If there’s been any law-breaking – and that’s yet to be established – then obviously we condemn that, as we always do in Scotland, but you’ve got to get things into context. A student demonstration isn’t the Dreyfus trial.’

Or, in other words, boys will be boys, no harm done if the leader of a UK political party is prevented from communicating with the Scottish public and if his attempts at civilised debate are drowned out by moronic chants of ‘Racist Nazi scum’.

As for Mr Farage and UKIP, they should understand that the majority of Scots will give them a fair hearing. In a local council by-election in Lanarkshire this year, UKIP beat the Liberal Democrats back into fifth place.

After the frenzy of the referendum, where the polls consistently forecast the nationalists will be heavily defeated, Scottish politics will realign.

With both the SNP and the Lib Dems in decline, there could then be opportunities for UKIP. In particular, disillusioned Conservative voters could rally to UKIP, appalled that David Cameron, in alliance with Labour and the Lib Dems, is planning to give quasi-independence – so-called ‘Devo Plus’ – to the Scottish parliament.

If that is to happen, UKIP will have to abandon its present proposal to hand all tax-raising powers to Holyrood. If it does, it could yet be a player in Scotland where, contrary to recent appearances, democracy is not dead.
