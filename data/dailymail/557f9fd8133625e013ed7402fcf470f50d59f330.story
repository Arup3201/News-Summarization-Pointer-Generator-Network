Bobbi Kristina Brown's boyfriend, Nick Gordon, on Thursday night denied planning to seek legal action to gain access to his girlfriend’s hospital bedside, despite previous reports to the contrary. 

Earlier in the day, Bobbi's cousin Jared Brown suggested in an interview with 11Alive that Gordon was preparing to take the matter to court.

Gordon's attorneys Randy Kessler and Joe Habachy released a statement on his behalf to set the record straight.  

'In response to reports that Nick Gordon is taking legal action, he would like it to be clear, he is not. Mr. Gordon's only concern is the recovery of Bobbi Kristina,' read the statement.  

'He remains in constant prayer for his companion and he hopes to be reunited with her soon. Despite the incredible public interest, we ask and hope that this request can be resolved privately by Mr. Gordon and the family.'

Ms Brown, 21, has been in a coma at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta since January 31, when she was found face down in a bathtub

Bobbi Kristina's family, including father Bobby Brown and grandmother Cissy Houston, have been by her bedside at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta since she was discovered face down in a bathtub January 31.

Gordon reportedly made an attempt to visit his girlfriend that first night, but instead he got into a physical confrontation with her relatives.

Last year, Bobbi Kristina’s maternal aunt Marion Houston sought an order of protection against Gordon, accusing him of stalking her and sending her threatening messages, which reportedly included photos of guns. The restraining order expires in April.

Jared Brown said he's been acting as a mediator between Gordon and Bobbi’s family.

‘We sit down and talk about things he wants my family to know and what we would love for Krissy to know, and that is that he loves her and is just waiting for her to wake up,’ he exclusively told the station 11Alive .

Some of the 21-year-old woman's relatives have called on prosecutors to charge Gordon in connection to the bathtub incident.

Last week, it emerged that police were investigating suspicious injuries found on Bobbi Kristina’s chest, as well as additional bruises on her mouth and face.

Gordon reportedly told a documentary friend do his that hurt Bobbi's chest while performing CPR on her.

Bobbi’s paternal aunt Leolah Brown said in an interview with Fox 5 Wednesday that she believes Nick Gordon will '110 per cent ' be charged with a crime.

It has emerged that one of Nick and Bobbi’s neighbors reported a domestic dispute at her address the week before she was found

No one has been charged in the incident or named as a suspect, and Gordon has not responded to the family's accusations.

It has also emerged that one of Nick and Bobbi’s neighbors reported a domestic dispute at her address the week before she was found, according to a 911 call made by her security guard on January 23.

The caller told a 911 dispatcher that one of the neighbors had reported a fight at the address. They said they saw people 'hitting each other and swinging' outside the three bedroom townhouse.

He did not give descriptions of how many people were fighting or who they were .

Nick Gordon was taken in by Houston as a child and brought up as Bobbi Kristina's brother - but after Houston's death, they started a romantic relationship and last year, they claimed they had married.

In the Fox interview, Leolah said she does not think Gordon has been a good influence on her niece.

Jared Brown said plans are being made to take Bobbi off the ventilator and asked people to continue praying for a miracle.
