A rare childbirth complication has claimed the life of a respected Michigan dentist - but her baby daughter survived.

Elizabeth Curtis, 34, suffered an amniotic fluid embolism at North Ottawa Community Hospital on Saturday and died the next day.

But doctors were able to save the baby girl, Katherine, who Curtis' grieving husband described as 'a blessing'.

'We look at her as a blessing and are 
very happy for that outcome at least,' Scott Curtis told MLive.com. 'It’s a little source of
 comfort that we know we have her.'

Scott and Elizabeth Curtis, together for more for than 10 years, had a three-year-old son, Adam.

Elizabeth Curtis had been laughing and joking in the birthing suite about 10 minutes before announcing she wasn't feeling well, Grand Haven Tribune reported.

Doctors performed an emergency C-section and Katherine was born a healthy 7lbs, 6oz.

As Elizabeth Curtis lay unconscious after the delivery, doctors laid baby Kate on her bare stomach, flesh-to-flesh.

Mother and child were transferred to Spectrum Health Butterworth Hospital in Grand Rapids where Elizabeth Curtis passed away on Sunday morning.

An amniotic fluid embolism occurs when 
amniotic fluid or fetal material enters the mother's bloodstream and 
causes an allergic-like reaction.

The unpredictable complication is said
 to occur in 1 in 15,200 deliveries in America, according to the 
Amniotic Fluid Embolism Foundation.

'It's so rare. You never even think of 
anything like this during childbirth,' Scott Curtis said. 'In talking 
with doctors and other people, most OB/GYNs never see this in their 
lifetimes.'

Scott Curtis' mother, Jane Curtis, told Grand Haven Tribune baby Kate was released from hospital on Monday afternoon and met her brother.

'They're doing just fine. Baby Kate is thriving. She's eating well,' she said.

'We're doing fine, but we miss Liz so 
much. It really was shocking. We can hear her laughter, 
though. It rings in our head. We're just going to take it one step at a 
time.'

Jane Curtis said doctors 'called Kate a miracle baby'.

She said Scott, Adam and Kate will move in with her and her husband, Charles Hettenbach, in Spring Lake Township and she will help care for the children.

Elizabeth Curtis had practiced dentistry for almost six years after graduating from dental school in 1997.

She was close to forming a full partnership at Creason, Weber & Curtis - her home dentist office growing up.

'We had just approved the contract for the partnership,' Dr Kennard Creason told Grand Haven Tribune. 'I won't be hearing that laugh next door to me anymore. I'm really going to miss that.'

Elizabeth Curtis was secretary of the
 Rotary Club of Grand Haven and treasurer of the Muskegon District 
Dental Society. She volunteered with the Miles of Smiles mobile dental 
unit that provides services for children from low-income families.

She recently started a podcast on YouTube, Ask Dr. Liz, that answered embarrassing, but common, dental questions.

For Scott Curtis, his wife's infectious laugh is what he will miss most.

'Whenever anyone heard it, they knew who was laughing,' he said. 'It was privilege and joy to know her for the 10 plus years.'

A memorial service is set for 11am Saturday at the First Presbyterian Church in Grand Haven.
