Graeme Swann feels England were 'crazy' to change their World Cup batting line-up at short notice - but still believes they can turn their tournament around.

The in-form James Taylor was dropped down the order to number six to accommodate Gary Ballance's return in place of Ravi Bopara for the competition opener against Australia.

Defeats in that game and against New Zealand - the latter an eight-wicket hammering having been bowled out for 123 - have left Peter Moores' side with an uphill task to make the quarter-finals.

And former Three Lions spinner Swann told BBC Radio Five's Sportsweek programme: 'I don't think the strategy's been clear. Every player hasn't got a clear and concise role.

'The Kiwis have been building up to this World Cup for four years and every player absolutely knows his role - Ashley Giles said that last night.

'England changed their batting line-up the morning of the World Cup against Australia, Gary Ballance is suddenly brought back in, James Taylor's down to number six, Ravi Bopara taken out of the squad - that was crazy, in my book.

'It's muddled, it's not clear. (Captain) Eoin Morgan wants to play a very expressive, aggressive form of cricket; I'm not sure Peter Moores completely agrees with that and I don't know how easily that relationship is going to fare.'

Results so far have seen speculation build around Moores' future, even at this early stage of his second spell in charge, but Swann is determined to remain positive.

'They were like rabbits in the headlights against New Zealand. The disparity was enormous,' he said.

'But if they actually play well for the next four games - beat Sri Lanka heavily, destroy Scotland - if they do that, all this anger and emotion will disappear. If they come out fighting and do well, we'll all get back on their side. 

'So I'm not going to jump on the bandwagon and say, 'Moores must go if we don't reach the quarter-finals'. I'm going to be the positive one that says, "in three weeks' time, we'll play New Zealand in the semi-final and thrash them by nine wickets".'

Next up for England is a clash with Scotland, who may just fancy their chances considering recent events.
