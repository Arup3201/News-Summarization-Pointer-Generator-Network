Boots is recalling thousands of bottles of medicines, including many designed for children, because they may contain pieces of plastic.

The firm has been alerted to a manufacturing fault associated with the machines that attach the tamper-proof plastic seals around the caps.

Parts of the seal may have fallen into the medicine as a result, creating the risk of a choking hazard.

The bottles, bought since September this year, have been recalled because they may contain pieces of plastic

There are no reports of any ill health to date, rather the problem was picked up on the production line.

The recall relates to:

- Boots Pharmaceuticals Chesty Cough Relief 100mg/5ml Oral Solution

- Boots Pharmaceuticals Dry Cough Relief Oral Solution

- Boots Pharmaceuticals Mucus Cough Relief 100mg/5ml Oral Solution

- Boots Pharmaceuticals Paracetamol 6 years Plus 250mg/5ml Oral Solution 200ml

- Boots Pharmaceuticals Ibuprofen 3 Months plus 100mg/5ml Oral suspension Strawberry flavour.

A spokesman said: ‘The health and safety of our customers and patients is always our highest priority, so as a precaution we are recalling some Boots Pharmaceuticals medicine lines.

‘We’ve discovered a potential manufacturing fault with the tamper seal on some Boots Pharmaceuticals liquid medicines, which might result in small pieces of plastic being found in the medicine.

‘While we’re not currently aware of any customer incidences, we have taken the decision to ask customers to return these products to our stores for a refund or replacement with a similar item.

‘We’re sorry for any inconvenience this may cause our customers and would like to offer our reassurances that these actions are taken as a precaution, while we fully investigate the situation.’

Recalled: Three of the affected products are: Boots Pharmaceuticals Paracetamol 6 
years Plus 250mg/5ml Oral Solution 200ml, Boots Pharmaceuticals 
Ibuprofen 3 Months plus 100mg/5ml Oral suspension Strawberry flavour and Boots Pharmaceuticals Chesty Cough Relief 100mg/5ml Oral Solution

Adam Burgess, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency’s Head of Defective Medicines Reporting Centre, added: ‘This is a precautionary recall by Boots and there is currently no evidence that people have had any problems with these cough and cold medicines.

‘People should check their medicine cupboards at home and return these products to Boots if they have purchased them since September 2013.

‘If people are worried or have any questions, they should speak to their pharmacist or GP.’

Boots is offering customers a refund if they return these medicines and people with questions can telephone Boots Customer Care on 0800 915 0004 or visit the healthcare team at their local Boots store.
