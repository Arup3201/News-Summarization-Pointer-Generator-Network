The world's rich and famous will soon have their very own 24-hour VIP airport terminal worth $30 million to fly into on their plush private jets when travelling Down Under.

Businessman Paul Little is building a VIP jet base at Melbourne’s Tullamarine Airport after forking out around $10 million for a precinct at the airbase. 

Over the next 18-24 months the hub will be upgraded and transformed into a luxurious terminal targeting super-rich Asian businesspeople and global superstars.

In 2014, A-list stars like Kim Kardashian, Beyonce, the Rolling Stones, Katy Perry, Taylor Swift and Miley Cyrus all flew into Melbourne and around Australia on private jets.

Mr Little, who boasts an $880 million dollar fortune of his own thanks to his former role as CEO of logistics group Toll Holdings, told the Australian Financial Review: 'We have entertainers, sports people, everyone from the Prime Minister down.' 

Although Australia already has private jet terminals, Mr Little believes his will be 'globally of a higher-standard.' 

Murray Rance, the managing director of Melbourne Aviation Precinct where the base will be located, told Daily Mail Australia: ‘What it’s going to do is offer a world class facility that isn't available in Australia… it will be a far more professional in bound and out bound experience.’

‘It will have customs clearance, check in, all the normal things you would have. Plus guest lounges, boardroom facilities, and things like bathrooms for people to have showers in.

‘These sort of people want to get in and out,’ he added.

Mr Rance revealed the private jet base will have the ability to park around 10 to 15 jets at one time.

Mr Little's company has been given the go-ahead for its plans and construction on the facility will start within six months.

The private jet terminal will boast pilot accommodation as well as hangarage and refuelling services for the jets.

The terminal will not have a curfew like nearby Essendon airport and Sydney airport, something which Mr Little believes will give his super-rich services an advantage.

Currently, Essendon airport in Melbourne captures 80 per cent of the private jet market.

Mr Little, who has his own Gulfstream 550 jet, said: ‘People who spend $60 million on an aircraft – what they want is all the impediments removed.

‘You want to land where you get the best treatment.’

The businessman already has one VIP customer – James Packer’s Crown Casino.

Mr Packer has three jets based at the facility. He has plans for a helicopter pad to soon be able to transport VIPs from the airport to the casino in Melbourne’s city centre.

Packer's private jets are worth $US100 million, after he upgraded Crown’s existing fleet of Gulfstream aircraft to three Bombardier Global Express XRS jets for its Asian VIP customers.

On board passengers are treated to a luxurious food and drink menu from Crown restaurants.

The Bombardiers feature 15 seats, nine sleeping berths and are made up of Rolls-Royce engines which allows it to fly 6000 nautical miles without the need for refuelling.

The costly upgrade comes after Mr Packer's company was cleared to run its new Sydney casino at Barangaroo in just three months by the NSW Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority.
