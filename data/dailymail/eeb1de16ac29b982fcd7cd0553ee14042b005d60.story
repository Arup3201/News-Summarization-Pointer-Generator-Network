Leonore Draper, 32, was an active member in the community- she was a campaigner for women impacted by HIV and AIDS

A woman who campaigned heavily against violence was fatally shot in Chicago - moments after leaving a fundraiser she had helped to organise for a youth anti-violence charity.

Leonore Draper, 32, attended the Project Orange Tree event in the Chicago suburb of West Pullman before she was attacked on Friday evening.  

Draper was shot in the arm and chest and died on the way to Advocate Christ Medical Center, Chicago Defender reports.  

The fundraiser, called A Charitable Confection, was dedicated to Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old girl who was shot dead in the city last year.  

Draper's brother Adrian Murrow said the family was in shock.  

'She wasn't the type of person that would ever try to mess you up ever,' he told the Chicago Sun-Times.  

'She was always trying to put a smile on your face.'  

Draper was an active member in the community. 

In addition to her anti-violence advocacy she was a campaigner for women impacted by HIV and AIDS. 

Draper's neighbour Andrew Loss told ABC Local she was in her car at the time of the shooting, dropping off her disabled husband.  

'Some little girl was taking the man into the house. Then when the little girl came back out the lady, she was dead,' he said.

Hadiya Pendleton, 15, was shot dead as she stood in a Chicago park with friends last January

The 32-year-old's friend Delk Adams described Draper as a 'bright light' and said the incident was sadly sympomatic of the violent culture they're trying to eradicate.  

'We need to stop this,' she told ABC Local.  

'We're losing people that don't need to be lost. There needs to be something done.' 

It comes after a spate of violence in Chicago over the Easter weekend  left nine people dead and another 36 wounded, including six children aged 11 to 15.

The news came the same day that police chief Garry McCarthy praised his force for keeping homicides down to their lowest level - 415 last year - since 1965.

That figure was an 18 per cent drop on 2012 and he said this year's rate is 'still ahead of where we were last year'. 

Speaking to WGN Radio's Steve Cochran, Supt McCarthy said: 'A week doesn't wipe out two years of progress. 

'We always knew that we're going to have good days and we're going to have bad days, we've just got to make sure we're having more good days than bad.'

He praised officers for 'getting out in front of the shootings' but told CNN it would take time for the improvements to be felt.

In the latest round of violence five children were shot in a drive-by on Sunday night after a person in a vehicle reportedly asked if the children were members of a particular street gang, then opened fire.

A sixth youngster, a 15-year-old girl, was shot while riding in a vehicle in what appears to be a separate gang-related incident.

Supt McCarthy highlighted the Easter killings to call for more gun control laws.

'It's just insanity that there's such a proliferation of firearms that they're so easy to get your hands on,' Supt McCarthy told WGN Radio

'The studies show when there's more restrictive gun laws, there's less gun violence. It's not brain surgery, it's really really simple.

'It's going to take us a while to fix poverty and the break-up of the family units and education and jobs. But we can do something about gun laws today and we're just not doing it.'
