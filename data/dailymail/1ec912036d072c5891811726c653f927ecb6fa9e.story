Joan Rivers had said some harsh words about the president and the first lady in the past, but that did not discourage Barack Obama from mourning her passing.

Melissa Rivers appeared Thursday night on a special episode of E!'s Fashion Police to talk about her late mother for the first time since the legendary comedienne passed away at age 81 on September 4.

Ms Rivers, dressed in black, sat down for an interview with her mother's grieving co-hosts, Kelly Osbourne, Giuliana Rancic and George Kotsiopoulos and spoke about the many people her mother touched.

Touched: Melissa Rivers received a handwritten note from Barack Obama that read in part: 'not only did she make us laugh, she made us think'

Among the dignitaries and celebrities who have reached out to the comic’s family since her passing was President Obama, who sent Melissa Rivers a handwritten note that read in part: 'not only did she make us laugh, she made us think.'

The tart-tongued comedienne, notorious for her take-no-prisoners attitude, often made fun of America’s first couple.

In July, Joan Rivers sparked a controversy after calling President Obama gay and his wife, Michelle, transgender, CNN reported. 

At the time, the Fashion Police host was asked by a photographer outside her Manhattan apartment building if she believed a gay or female president would ever occupy the White House.

The quick-witted Ms Rivers responded by saying: ' we already have it with Obama, so let's just calm down.

She then added: 'you know Michelle is trans.'

Big shoes to fill: Rivers paid tribute to her famous mother by appearing on a special episode of the Fashion Police Thursday night 

The Sidney Morning Herald reported that just weeks before her passing, Ms Rivers told the Sunday Times Magazine in an interview that Mrs Obama was not allowed to attend her funeral because she was a 'tranny.'

The list of celebrities banned by Rivers from her memorial service also included late-night host Chelsea handler, whom she branded a 'w****,' and singer Adele, whom Rivers called 'fat.' 

Today E! is celebrating 'Joan Rivers day' - with back-to-back episodes of Fashion Police and a 90-minute special of the show featuring Melissa Rivers and co-hosts Guiliana Rancic, Kelly Osbourne and George Kotsiopoulos.

The marathon viewing includes Joan's birthday episode and also the last show she filmed. Ms Rivers passed away on September 4 at the age of 81 after slipping into a coma a week earlier following a throat procedure at a Manhattan clinic.

The special tribute will also include outtakes and never-before-seen footage, according to CBS.

The E! Fashion Police episodes are airing from 7am until 7pm before the 'Celebrating Joan' special at 8pm. 

On Wednesday evening, Melissa Rivers posted this message to her social media accounts: 'As my son Cooper and I mourn the loss of my mother, we want to thank everyone for the beautiful cards and flowers conveying heartfelt messages and condolences, which continue to arrive from around the world and through social media.

'My mother would have been overwhelmed by the scope and depth of the love that people have expressed for her. It is certainly helping to lift our spirits during this time.

'We are forever grateful for your kindness and support in continuing to honor my mother’s legacy, and for remembering the joy and laughter that she brought to so many.'

Alongside her mother, Melissa Rivers hosted red-carpet fashion for the E! cable network. 

Last year, she co-created her mother's web show In Bed With Joan, a series of short interviews which starred Kathy Griffin, Sarah Silverman, Kelly Osbourne and Carmen Electra among many others.

Melissa Rivers' emotional words came as new details emerged on Wednesday about the throat procedure which led the comedienne to slip into a coma last month.  

Dr Gwen Korovin, 56, is known as a 'throat specialist to the stars', and was in attendance during the procedure that led to Joan Rivers' death, MailOnline has learned. 

The doctor, who counts Hugh Jackman, Julie Andrews, Lady Gaga, pop princess Ariana Grande and Celine Dion among her celebrity patients, is an esteemed ear, nose and throat specialist based in Manhattan.

It is believed that Dr Korovin was at Yorkville Endoscopy clinic on August 28 as Joan’s personal doctor when the legendary comedienne stopped breathing while undergoing a procedure on her vocal cords.

Staff at Dr Korovin's offices on the Upper East Side of Manhattan refused to comment. 

CNN reported that a source close to the investigation into Joan's death being carried out by the New York State Department of Health said the star suffered a cardiac arrest as her personal doctor performed a biopsy on her vocal cords.

A staff member at Yorkville Endoscopy clinic told investigators that the doctor even took a 'selfie' photo in the procedure room while Joan was under anesthesia, the source said.

Joan Rivers, 81, arrived at the Upper East side clinic for an endoscopy with gastroenterologist Dr Lawrence Cohen, Yorkville's medical director, on the morning on August 28.

The procedure was intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat, and involved the insertion of a camera down her throat.

An ear, nose and throat specialist - who was not certified by the clinic, as required by law - then performed a biopsy on the star's vocal cords.

The doctor was described by the source as Joan's personal ENT specialist.

CNN said that investigators believe that Joan's vocal chords began to swell during the biopsy, cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which led to cardiac arrest.

The comedienne was rushed to nearby Mount Sinai hospital from the clinic. However, she never regained consciousness and died on September 4 after being taken off life support and spending her final days with her daughter Melissa Rivers by her side and her loved ones paying their final respects.

On Friday, Dr Cohen stepped down from his position at the medical center.

A Yorkville spokesperson confirmed to MailOnline: 'Dr Cohen is not currently performing procedures at Yorkville Endoscopy; nor is he currently serving as medical director.’

Sources told ABC news that Dr Cohen had allowed a specialist, who was not authorized to practice at the clinic, to examine Joan.

Neither Dr Cohen nor the specialist have been accused of wrongdoing.

Today, the New York State Department of Health, in a statement to People, said: 'The State Department of Health's investigation is ongoing. As this is an open investigation, DOH cannot comment on any specifics regarding the investigation.'
