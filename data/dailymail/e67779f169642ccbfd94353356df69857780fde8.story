This is the incredible moment a snowmobiler in the back country in Wyoming was buried under an avalanche he triggered - and was saved by his quick-thinking friends. 

The video - taken from a helmet cam by Mike Salmon, shows the snowmobiler speeding up a steep mountainside covered with virgin snow.

Then, in an instant, the disaster strikes. Almost in slow motion, a wide swath of snow breaks loose from the mountain and begins to crash down the side, swallowing the rider under a massive wall. 

This is the moment that an avalanche caught a snowmobile rider who was climbing a mountainside on virgin snow in the back country of Wyoming

In an instant, the snomobiler was swallowed in a wall of white as the avalanche came crashing down the mountainside

Mr Salmon uploaded the harrowing footage to YouTube, where it has already been viewed by nearly 55,000 people. 

He writes that the avalanche occurred last Friday outside Afton, Wyoming - near the Idaho border. 

As the avalanche tumbled down the mountain, Mr Salmon and the other snowmobilers quickly realized that it could bury them, as well - despite them taking up a post several hundred yards away. They quickly drove away from the avalanche until the snow came to a rest.

Then within seconds, they spotted their friend's snowmobile, which was on its side with a ski sticking out of the snow. 

Just a few feet away, the was the rider - who had miraculously come to a rest with his helmet sticking out. 

As his friends work to dig him out, it's clear he's shaken up but uninjured. 

Mr Salmon writes that the rider was wearing an airbag device - which inflates and helps keep avalanche victims at the top of the pile - but he was jostled before he could pull the rip cord and inflate it.

When the rider's friends realized that the avalanche was coming for them, too, they quickly sped off away from the mountain
