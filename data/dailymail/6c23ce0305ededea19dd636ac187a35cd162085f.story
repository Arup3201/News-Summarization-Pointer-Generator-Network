Steven Gerrard has described it as the 'toughest decision of my life' after announcing he will leave Liverpool.

As the tributes for Steven Gerrard poured in from his team-mates on Friday morning, it was left to Mario Balotelli to offer some words of warning to the Liverpool hierarchy.

'Stevie can do anything, he's an amazing player,' said the Italian striker. 'It's going to be very difficult for the team to find another player like him in the future.'

Gerrard's level of performance may have dipped quite dramatically at times this season but Balotelli has a point. How does Brendan Rodgers go about replacing arguably the club's most iconic figure when he departs Anfield - most likely for Major League Soccer - this summer?

Premier League: 494 appearances, 116 goals

FA Cup: 39 appearances, 13 goals

League Cup: 28 appearances, 9 goals

Champions League: 87 appearances, 30 goals

UEFA Cup/Europa League: 42 appearances, 11 goals

Other: 5 appearances, 1 goal

TOTAL: 695 appearances, 180 goals

Well, he might not have to. 

Jordan Henderson, like many of Rodgers' squad, has struggled for form since last season's blistering campaign saw Liverpool come agonisingly close to their first Premier League title.

But the 24-year-old hasn't become a bad player overnight. In fact, with the energy levels of a young Gerrard, an eye for a pass and a tenacity to his game, Henderson's potential could well prevent Liverpool splashing the cash on a new central midfielder.

Rodgers clearly believes the former Sunderland midfielder has the leadership qualities required to inspire his team-mates in similar fashion, having named him as the club's vice captain back in September.

Henderson is known to have a good rapport with the rest of the squad - particularly Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling - and is not afraid to offer guidance and advice to young players despite his own tender years.

He gets on well with his manager and Rodgers will often call him over during games to explain instructions, trusting him to pass them on to the rest of the team.

Having already captained the Merseysiders in the absence of Gerrard this season, it will be a natural progression for Henderson to take over the role full-time at the start of next season.

He is accustomed to the responsibility, having worn the armband for England's Under 21 side before making the step up to the Three Lions' senior squad.

After being excused from a friendly against Israel in 2011, Henderson decided to stay behind and help organise a night of team bonding instead of travelling home. He understands the importance of togetherness, just like Gerrard.

And just like the Reds' departing skipper, Henderson is also a model professional. He turns up early for training, works hard and ensures he is in the best possible condition come matchday.

But it's not just off the pitch that Henderson shares similarities with his former England team-mate.

After a difficult start to life at Anfield, the Sunderland-born midfielder has blossomed into one of Rodgers' star performers and an influential figure for both club and country.

Although shunted out wide too much this season, Henderson showed last term that he has all the qualities needed to be an effective box-to-box player, just like Gerrard was at his best.

He may not be as prolific in front of goal as his more senior colleague but, with more assists (five), tackles made (47) and a greater crossing and corner accuracy than Gerrard this season, Henderson is capable of cementing his place in Liverpool's midfield for the next decade.

Gerrard himself saw Henderson's raw talent when Liverpool spent £20million to bring him to Anfield three-and-a-half years ago.

Speaking to the Daily Express in June 2011, Gerrard said: 'It's a really positive signing. Let's hope he is the next Steven Gerrard. 

'Liverpool needs a new Steven Gerrard and it will need a new Jamie Carragher. That's what good football clubs do - they replace their best players.'

After 695 games, 180 goals and 10 trophies so far, Gerrard will leave behind a pair of huge boots to fill when he calls time on Liverpool career at the end of this season.

Luckily for Rodgers and the Anfield faithful, the man to step into them may already be in their ranks.
