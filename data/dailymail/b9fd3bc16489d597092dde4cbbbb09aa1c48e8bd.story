A man believed to have committed a string of armed robberies in a demonic mask has had his leg amputated and is recovering from a broken back after falling off a cliff.

The 38-year-old allegedly robbed a drug store in Alabama last Friday night armed with a rifle and made away with an undisclosed sum.

A short time later, he held up a convenience store and as he was making his getaway, was followed by a 53-year-old customer who was shot and critically injured.

The following day, police were alerted that a man had fallen from a cliff and when rescuers found his vehicle, they came across items from the robbery.

Jefferson County sheriff's Chief Deputy Randy Christian told Al.com: 'I would like to think that maybe he jumped off of that cliff because of remorse, but I can't give him that much credit.'

The suspect told police that he had been hit by a car but refused to answer further questions. The 38-year-old was being treated at a hospital in Birmingham, Alabama.

His name will not be released until he is charged and while the investigation is ongoing, the police report said.

He has been linked to robberies at several stores in Jefferson and Blount Counties within the last two weeks including one at Tyner's Pharmacy where prescription drugs were stolen on October 15 and another at a convenience store four days earlier.Â
