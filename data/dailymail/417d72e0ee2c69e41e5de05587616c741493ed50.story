Fred and Luiz Gustavo seem to have been preempting the Brazil training camp this week as the World Cup favourites get their preparations underway.

The pair enjoyed a game of FIFA as the squad relaxed at their base in Teresopolis, 90 kilometres from Rio de Janeiro.

And in what could be a real game in the coming days, the players cheekily opted for Brazil vs Brazil as they faced off.

Fred spun in his chair to celebrate as Paulinho - the in-game Tottenham midfielder, of course - notched for his side against Gustavo's.

Luiz Felipe Scolari's side don't appear to be feeling the heat as time ticks down to the start of the tournament next month.

The hosts' head coach greeted each member as they arrived at their Granja Comary complex.

That included David Luiz, who could be forgiven for having other things on his mind.

The Chelsea defender is on the verge of signing for Paris Saint-Germain for Â£40million, but looked focused and relaxed as Scolari welcomed him in to he Brazilian's home for - they hope - the next six weeks.
