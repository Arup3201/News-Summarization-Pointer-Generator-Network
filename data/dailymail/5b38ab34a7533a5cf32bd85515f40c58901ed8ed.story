Retired Republican politician Mitt Romney says he passed on a third presidential campaign because 'it just didn't feel right' and will instead allocate his time to business and philanthropic causes, as well as his wife Ann and their 23 grandchildren.

'Somehow, it just didn’t feel like this was the right time for us to step forward,' Romney told Yahoo Global News Anchor Katie Couric during an interview that was released on Thursday.

'I would love to be president. I just concluded I was not the best person to carry forward the Republican torch.'

Romney wouldn't endorse one of the many possible GOP presidential candidates in his first interview since he took his name off the 2016 roster but spoke sharply of Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul would all make tremendous presidents, he indicated.

Bush, who was widely considered Romney's biggest hurdle toward securing the Republican presidential nomination for a second consecutive time due to their similarity in background and policy positions, Romney described as a 'sound, effective governor.'

He will make for 'a very formidable and capable candidate,' said Romney, who met privately with the fellow former governor just before he definitively ended rumors that he was contemplating a 2016 bid.

Walker he characterized as 'a man of integrity and character' and said 'he makes a very compelling case to become a nominee.'

'He was one that faced a recall, fought for his agenda; it was supported by the people of Wisconsin,' Romney told Couric. 'I think a guy like that really has stood the test of a very close inspection.'

Romney also voiced approval of a possible Rubio candidacy,saying the freshman senator 'has really distinguished himself' on foreign policy.

And while he and Paul, whose father Ron competed against the Massachusetts governor for the party's blessing in both 2008 and 2012, don't often see eye to eye, particularly on foreign policy issues, Romney said he understands the draw to the non-traditional Republican lawmaker.

'A lotta young people are very excited about Rand Paul. And of course, there’s a libertarian strain in my party, and he’s connected with a lotta folks who wanna see us take a different course as a party,' Romney said. 'I mean, more power to him as he expresses his views.'

Clinton, on the other hand, is in quite 'a mess' over her secret server and will have to defend what he called 'the Hillary Clinton/Barack Obama foreign policy.'

'I mean, it’s always something with the Clintons,' he said, responding to a question about the former secretary of state's email debacle. 

'They have rules which they describe before they get into something, and then they decide they don’t have to follow their own rules. And that, I think, is gonna be a real problem for her,' he said.

He added, 'She didn’t follow the rules and regulations of the federal government.'

Romney became the laughing stock of much of the political class in the lead up to the 2012 election when he named Russia as the United States' greatest geopolitical foe but has since been heralded by Republicans as as visionary. 

In the interview he again scrutinized Clinton for her infamous 'reset' with Russia and the mock button she gave the country's top diplomat Sergei Lavrov in 2009.

He also warned that Islamic extremists abroad are unlikely to suffer defeat if the Obama administration continues to refuse to put American troops on the ground.

'I’m afraid you’re gonna have to see more American military involvement in order to keep ISIS from spreading even further,' he said.

It would be ideal for most of the ground troops to be provided by regional partners such as 'Turkey or Saudi Arabia or others,' Romney said.

'But I think, as the President of the United States, you have to say that we will defeat ISIS, period. Full stop. And we will do what’s necessary for that to happen.'

Reacting to former Obama senior adviser David Axelrod's claims in his memoir that Romney suggested in his election night, congratulatory call to the president that he won reelection because blacks in urban cities voted for him, Romney said a 'misunderstanding' must have occurred.

Axelrod claims that Romney told Obama, 'You really did a great job of getting the vote out in places like Cleveland and Milwaukee.'

'I certainly did not,' Romney told Couric. 

'I remember going into the room with a few of my staff people, picking up the phone and being as gracious as I could possibly be at a very difficult time, and congratulating the president on winning and congratulating him on having a good campaign and running a good campaign. 

The former Republican politician acknowledged that he 'may well have said what a good job they did turning people out, because they did.'

But 'I don’t even know what happened in Milwaukee, so some of those quotes are obviously a misunderstanding.'

'I had nothing but congratulations for the president and positive feelings that I expressed to him,' he posited.
