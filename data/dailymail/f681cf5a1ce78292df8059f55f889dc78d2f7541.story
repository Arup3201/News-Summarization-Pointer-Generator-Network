'This is amazing and to win this tournament again is fantastic, said van Gerwen. 'I missed a lot of doubles but I did everything I could to win the game.

'The 110 checkout to win the fifth set showed how good I was, but it also showed James' class with the way he came back after that.

'James could have won the game, but I think I was the stronger player when I needed to be. James made it very difficult but I was just the better player and I'm so happy.

'He did brilliantly to reach the final and deserved to be there, but there can only be one winner and I'm glad it's me.

'You play darts to be the best in the world and I'm very glad that I'm in the number one position. I want to stay there but firstly I'm going to enjoy this because it's a huge win for me.'

Wade, a two-time World Grand Prix winner, was the better player at the start as Van Gerwen squandered chances on doubles.

Van Gerwen leveled from a leg down with some mighty darts, taking just 12, 14 and 13 to win his legs.

The Dutchman was forced to retaliate again as Wade raced through set three but Van Gerwen held on to level 2-2.

Van Gerwen edged a dramatic fifth set which was sent into a decider. Wade threw 180 and 177 to leave 20 in leg five only to miss three darts at double 10.

The world number one seized upon his chance with a magnificent 110 checkout to put him 3-2 up in the final.

Wade hit back immediately with 141, 61 and 96 checkouts as he came from a leg down to win the sixth set 3-1 and square the match.

The seventh set was the pivotal set in the final outcome as Wade, the 2007 and 2010 winner, missed three set darts at 2-0 up.

Again Van Gerwen roared back with some sensational arrows. The Dutchman took out 106 for a 12-darter on his way to lead 4-3.

He then rattled through set eight, landing his ninth 180 of the match at 2-0 up to pull clear in leg three, before landing tops to secure the prestigious title.
