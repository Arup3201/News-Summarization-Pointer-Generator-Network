Ander Herrera hopes to play for Manchester United at West Bromwich Albion on Monday night with the help of a corset.

The Spanish midfielder broke a rib against West Ham last month and was initially ruled out for six weeks but United believe he can return in half that time and play at the Hawthorns by wearing the protective corset.

Herrera is the only one of United’s nine casualties in contention to face the Baggies.

Antonio Valencia - hamstring, Paddy McNair - hamstring, Ander Herrera - rib, Chris Smalling - hip/thigh, Jonny Evans - ankle/foot, Ashley Young - groin/pelvis, Phil Jones - hamstring, Jesse Lingard - knee, Michael Carrick - ankle/foot 

Manager Louis van Gaal has other options, with players such as Marouane Fellaini available, while Michael Carrick may feature in a behind-closed-doors game at Burnley’s Turf Moor on Friday afternoon.

The United boss will be hoping his side can follow up recent victories against West Ham and Everton when they travel to The Hawthorns. 

The Red Devils take on Premier League rivals Chelsea and Manchester City after Monday's trip to West Brom.
