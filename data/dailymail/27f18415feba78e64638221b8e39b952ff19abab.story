A judge is preparing to rule on whether to grant prosecution lawyers an appeal against the decision not to convict Oscar Pistorius of murder after he admitted shooting his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp at his home on Valentine's Day last year

A  judge has postponed her decision on whether to grant a state appeal that could open the way for Oscar Pistorius to serve more time behind bars - or even allow him to temporarily walk free from prison.

Prosecution lawyers have applied for an appeal after Judge Thokozile Masipa in October sentenced the Paralympic gold medallist to five years in jail after a trial that attracted worldwide interest.

Pistorius, who was not in court for the hearing, admits shooting his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp four times through a locked toilet door on Valentine's Day 2013, insisting he thought she was an intruder.

The judge found him guilty of culpable homicide, also known as manslaughter, rather than a more serious charge of murdering Steenkamp. 

Addressing Judge Masipa in the same Pretoria courtroom where the murder trial was conducted, prosecutor Gerrie Nel said she had made a mistake in her interpretation of the law.

He told her: 'There is a very good prospect that we may convince an appeal court that the shortest possible incarceration in a case like this, my lady, is shockingly inappropriate.' 

Judge Masipa however says she will respond to the prosecution's appeal on Wednesday.

Ahead of the application, Miss Steenkamp's mother, June, said she hoped any appeal hearings would finally get to the truth about her daughter's death.

She told Alex Crawford from Sky News: 'I wanted the truth (at the trial), but it seems some of the puzzle is missing.

'There's only two people who know what happened. One of them's my daughter and she's not here anymore.'  

She said an extended prison sentence for the athlete would not make the grieving process any easier for the family.

Miss Steenkamp added: 'What difference is it going to make to me? I wanted to see him go down the steps [to the court cells].

'So it doesn't really matter how long - he's going to know that he can't go around hurting people.' 

Mrs Steenkamp and her husband Barry previously said they felt 'let down' by South Africa's justice system after Pistorius was acquitted of murder. 

In a bizarre twist, Mannie Witz, one of South Africa's leading defence lawyer who specialises in murder trials, said Pistorius could apply for bail even though it 'would cause a public outcry'.

He told MailOnline: 'They could reasonably ask the court why must their client wait a year or more in custody while waiting for an appeal against his conviction and sentence.

'The prosecution are appealing against his conviction and sentence and he could end up with a lesser sentence than the one that was handed down.'

'Shockingly inappropriate sentence': Addressing Judge Masipa in the same Pretoria court where the murder trial was conducted, prosecutor Gerrie Nel (above) said she had erred in her interpretation of the law

If Judge Masipa (above) grants the appeal, the case will be heard in South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein, the country's judicial capital

Mr Witz, who predicted the collapse of the Dewani trial weeks ago, said he thought Judge Thokozile Masipa would grant prosecutors leave to appeal Pistorius conviction and sentence later today. 

Another lawyer said the decision to throw out the Shrien Dewani murder trial in Cape Town yesterday may have a bearing on the appeal because the courts would want to show they are rigorous and fair.  

Prosecutor Gerrie Nel argued in appeal papers filed last month that Masipa misinterpreted the law when she ruled Pistorius did not intentionally shoot Steenkamp, describing the sentence as 'shockingly light' and 'inappropriate'. 

Pistorius, a South African athletics superstar after the double amputee competed against able-bodied runners in the Olympics, can qualify for house arrest after serving one sixth of his sentence - 10 months - behind bars, which would mean he could serve the majority of his time outside prison walls.

Should Masipa grant the appeal, the case will be heard in South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein, the country's judicial capital.

Reeva Steenkamp's parents Barry Steenkamp and June Steenkamp, previously said they felt 'let down' by South Africa's justice system after Pistorius was acquitted of murder, bit found guilty of manslaughter

But the judge may not necessarily grant the appeal, siding with defence lawyers representing the athlete who say her interpretation of the law was correct. 

'It doesn't matter what the outcome of the appeal is, if the appeal is allowed then other judges will be able to comment on the decision, and that's critical,' said Hood, who has been following the Pistorius case throughout the year. 

Hood said that with the decision of a Cape Town court yesterday to throw out the Shrien Dewani case - another high-profile murder trial involving a beautiful young woman killed in the dead of night - South Africa's courts need to demonstrate they are rigorous and fair.

'From a perception point of view, both public and internationally, we need to tell everybody that we have a robust and effective legal system.'

Pistorius, who celebrated his 28th birthday last month, has been serving his sentence in a Pretoria prison.

If Masipa refuses to grant the appeal, the state can petition the decision, a common legal strategy in South Africa.

'I honestly don't think that Masipa would refuse leave to appeal, there's just too much controversy about the judgement,' said Martin Hood, a criminal lawyer based in Johannesburg. 

'He's encountering many beautiful stories from prisoners. There are people there who have committed crimes but whose lives have changed,' said his older brother Carl, in an interview with You magazine, a South African tabloid.

Pistorius has been accused of receiving special treatment in South Africa's notoriously corrupt prisons, where there is frequent reports of inmates using cellphones and even drinking alcohol behind bars.

Yet Carl dismissed claims his brother is living the good life, saying Pistorius relies on weekly 45-minute visits with his family to leave cash at the canteen so he can supplement his standard prison diet with tasty snacks, including baked beans and canned pilchards.

'He now lives moment by moment,' said Carl. 'There's no fairytale.'
