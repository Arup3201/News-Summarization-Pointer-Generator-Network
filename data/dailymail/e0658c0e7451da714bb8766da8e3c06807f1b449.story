Veteran DJ Dave Lee Travis has pleaded not guilty to indecently assaulting a woman

Veteran DJ Dave Lee Travis has pleaded not guilty to indecently assaulting a woman.

The former BBC presenter, 68, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court in central London for a brief hearing accused of indecently assaulting a woman aged over 16 on January 17, 1995.

Asked to enter his plea to the charge Travis, who appeared under his real name David Griffin, answered: 'Not guilty.'

Travis, nicknamed 'The Hairy Cornflake' during his stint presenting Radio 1's mid-morning show, spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and to enter his plea.

Dressed in a grey woollen blazer, white shirt, patterned tie and black trousers, Travis, from Buckinghamshire, was told to appear for a further hearing at Southwark Crown Court on May 8.

Speaking outside court, he added: 'I don't think I need to say anything really.

'I think I will just leave it there.'

The veteran DJ - also known as DLT - was cleared of 12 counts of indecent assault in February following a six-week trial.

He faces a retrial on two outstanding charges.
