A school which radically changed its learning hours, sending students home at lunchtime 'to capture their peak learning time' has reported amazing results.

Merrylands East Primary School (MEPS) in Sydney's western suburbs begins its classes at 8am and has back-to-back classes, plus a 30-minute break, until 1.15pm.

The Queensland University of Technology conducted a two-year study and found the restructured day has had 'a tremendous impact'.

Merrylands East Primary School John Goh has won a scholarship to attend a Harvard leadership school for his groundbreaking approach to education

'They particularly found that the engagement has risen in the boys and is consistent for the girls,' Principal John Goh told Radio National, adding students were more engaged and found learning more enjoyable.

A homework centre operates from 1.15pm to 3pm to help working parents.

Mr Goh also introduced new classroom layouts and increased the use of technology.

'We have minimal furniture. Not every child has a chair or a table because we know children don't always learn best at a desk,' he said.

The furniture includes round tables, booths and bean bags to allow for a range of different work behaviours.

Queensland University of Technology's Professor Linda Graham said: The teachers report far fewer kids getting into trouble due to lunchtime argy-bargy and they are not tired and emotional in that relatively useless last session of the day.

'The children have more time to play and be with their family.'

Mr Goh, the principal, demonstrating the school's unique classroom layout and their implementation of technology and laptops into their curriculum.

Senior teacher Solange Cruz told The Daily Telegraph the hour after lunch was a 'wasted' period.

'(With an 8am start time) the kids are fresher, they come to school on time and they are busy right away,' she said.

'The hour after lunch used to be a wasted hour but now the kids are doing maths and English all the way through to 1.15pm and they are no longer exhausted.

Mr Goh added: 'Along with changing school times we have changed the way that we have been teaching the children. We've been doing some really exciting things with technology with our children.

'(The students are studying) 3D printing, website design and phone apps. Years one and two each have their own laptops.'

Children are given options in their learning space, with the choice to sit at benches, round tables, plush seating and bean bags.

Mr Goh says that the students are indicating that they are developing a genuine love of education, by being involved in the groundbreaking approach to education.

Suallyn Mitchelmore, an academic in the field of Early Childhood Education, says it is time for school systems to embrace change and turn to research to make decisions that are best for the children.Â 

'The framework for school systems has not changed since its inception post the industrial revolution.

'It's about time schools met children's needs. Children have always had to 'get ready for school,' rather than the schools getting ready for the children.

'If the research says that 8am-1pm is the optimal time for learning then surely this is a good thing.'
