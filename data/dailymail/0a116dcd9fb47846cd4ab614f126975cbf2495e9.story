A fifth expectant mother has died giving birth at a hospital already under investigation after four other women died in similar circumstances.

A new probe is today under way at Homerton Hospital in Hackney, east London, instigated following the latest death last month.

NHS England was called in last summer to assist an internal review into how the first four mothers died within a space of eight months.

Such deaths are extremely rare - therefore it is unusual for a single hospital to have so many deaths in a short period.

In the whole of England and Wales in 2013 there were just 47 maternal deaths during pregnancy, childbirth and the six-week period following birth - out of almost 700,000 deliveries.

A fifth expectant mother has died at Homerton University Hospital, it has emerged. A new investigation is now under way at the east London trust. It comes after a series of probes following the deaths of four other women in similar circumstances over eight months from July 2013 to April last year

Homerton Hospital has already been the subject of one internal review, another by the health watchdog, the Care Quality Commission and a further by the City and Hackney Commissioning Care Group.

The investigations came following persistent allegations from an anonymous group of whistleblowing midwives raising concerns over 'avoidable' deaths of mothers and babies at the maternity department.

The first four deaths occurred in July and October 2013, and January and April 2014.

The latest death, the fifth, is believed to have followed an elective Caesarean section.

The mother died on January 17, and a spokesman for Homerton University Hospital said the matter 'is in the hands of the coroner'.

The hospital added  the case would not be included in its internal review into the other four deaths, which is not yet complete.

It has also not revealed details of any of the cases, citing confidentiality and 'potentially identifiable patient information'.

A group who dub themselves the 'unhappy midwives' flagged up concerns two years ago.

They referenced several unspecified serious incidents at the hospital, claiming women and babies were being exposed to poor standards of care and a culture of racial discrimination. 

Results of an independent investigation by the City and Hackney Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) published in September concluded none of the allegations could be substantiated and did not identify any failings in the standard of care.

But an unabridged copy of the report leaked to the Hackney Gazette made urgent recommendations.

It refers to an under-staffing of consultants and supervisor midwives, and the extraordinary fact no obstetricians were available to undertake an analysis following any major incident.

The report states that serious events were not referred for further scrutiny 'that may have enabled the service to detect themes with incidents or individuals involved'.

Maternal deaths in childbirth are very rare. In England and Wales in 2013 there were 47 such deaths in total

It adds: 'In at least three cases that were reviewed the statements described missing equipment or inadequate rooms that could have an impact on the care provided.'

At the beginning of an investigation in October 2013, the trust was advised to consider informing the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) of serious incidents.

However the report points out that in early January 2014 - by which time three maternal deaths had occurred - it had not informed the NMC.

A spokesman for the trust said it was investigating the latest death which had been reported to the 'appropriate authorities'. 

A spokesman for City and Hackney CCG said: 'As commissioner for maternity services, City and Hackney CCG takes its role and responsibilities extremely seriously, which is why it requested a full and independent review of the allegations made by the Unhappy Midwives.

'The investigation found no failings in the standard of maternity care at Homerton Hospital although there were some recommendations for improvement. 

'These are being closely monitored by the CCG's Maternity Services Board. 

'Any maternal death is extremely saddening and the CCG will work closely with the Trust to implement any recommendations of the recent review that was carried out by NHS England at the request of Homerton Hospital. 

'Our overriding concern is, and always will be, to ensure that women receive the best care possible.'
