They couple had an on-again, off-again relationship which had last six years. In 2009 Johnson had successfully filed a lawsuit against Esters seeking child support.

Esters told police that he slept in his car the night before the shooting because he wanted to see his daughter the next day.

Johnson and Esters were believed to be arguing in the moments leading up to him shooting her. It unknown what the argument was over or what Johnson had posted on Facebook that had so enraged Esters.

The couple’s daughter and an older child belonging to Jennifer Johnson were away at the time of the shooting.

Her mother, Della Johnson, 53, told jurors that she had gone to her 
daughter’s home to help jump-start her car and that after shooting her 
daughter four times, he shot her in the chest.

‘Esters was hollering, “Call 911, there’s been a murder,’” Della Johnson told the jury. ‘And he was telling me that I needed to sit my stupid ass down before I bled to death.’

On Monday, Esters rejected a plea agreement that would have sent him to prison for 55 years. He would have had to serve half the sentence before he could be considered for parole.

His trial started on Tuesday and if convicted, he could serve 99 years in prison.
