Prince Harry is planning on proposing to his girlfriend Cressida Bonas by the end of the year, royal insiders have predicted.

The Prince, 28, has been dating the 24-year-old dance student since July last year but sources have claimed the relationship has become far more serious and they are bracing themselves for an engagement announcement.

Harry sparked rumours earlier this month when he whisked Cressida off on a romantic African safari, just like his brother William did with Kate in 2010 when he asked her to marry him.

The Daily Star Sunday quoted sources who said Prince Harry has joked in private that a proposal could be made 'any day' now.

The insider told the newspaper: 'The way it's looking now people close to Harry and Cressida predict an engagement by the end of the year and a spring wedding.

'Cressida is The One. People have heard Harry talking about how special Cress is and about getting engaged.'

The source claims the Prince, an Apache helicopter pilot, has proved how serious he is about their relationship by taking her to Africa to show her the work he does with anti-landmine charity the HALO Trust in Angola.

It was a cause championed by his mother Diana, Princess of Wales and is also one close to his heart.

Prince Harry recently sparked engagement rumours by taking Cressida on safari in Botswana following a charity trip to anti-landmine charity the HALO in Angola

His mother visited minefields being cleared by the charity just before her death in 1997.

Their safari trip to Botswana also echoed the holiday Prince William and the future Duchess of Cambridge had in Kenya when he proposed to her in October 2010.

According to The Daily Star Sunday, Kensington Palace is preparing itself for an engagement announcement and security teams are even accommodating it in their duty rotas.

Dancer Cressida, who recently graduated from the Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in Greenwich, avoids the public eye wherever possible and the couple are very careful about being photographed together.

However, they were seen arriving at Kings Cross Station together following the society wedding of the year of Thomas van Straubenzee and the Duke of Northumberland's daughter Lady Melissa Percy in June.

Prince Harry's ex Chelsy Davy was a bridesmaid at the wedding.

The pair split for good in 2011 after a seven year, off-off relationship and it is believed the pressures of the intense spotlight contributed to the break up.

Other than Cressida, Chelsy is the Prince's only serious relationship although he has been linked to a number of blondes.

He has previously dated lingerie model Florence Brudenell-Bruce but they split in August 2011.

A spokesman for Kensington Palace said it was a private matter and declined to comment.
