It is the kind of error that would have left Bridget Jones herself feeling v v embarrassed and resolving to try harder.

Readers of the latest instalment of the hapless singleton’s diary were astonished to discover Bridget’s reflections on life and love interrupted by 40 pages of Sir David Jason’s memoirs.

Fans reported getting to the middle of Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy only to find their narrator replaced with Del Boy.

Fans of Bridget Jones got more than expected today when parts of Sir David Jason's autobiography appeared halfway through Helen Fielding's latest novel

Any initial shock and upset at 
discovering the pages from Sir David's novel however could be replaced 
by knowing that the quirky copies will become collectors’ items.

A spokesman for publishers Vintage said: 'The printers have had a Bridget moment.

Slimline: Author Helen Fielding on her way to a Pilates class

'A printing error has been detected in some of the very early copies of Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy.

'Copies printed on one day have given readers an accidental preview of David Jason’s autobiography.

'We are taking steps to remove these copies from sale and will be replacing misprinted stock as soon as possible.'

The book, which is meant to be Fielding’s goodbye to the world’s most famous singleton, was released along with Sir David’s book today - one of the biggest dates in the publishing calendar.

Dubbed 'Super Thursday', dozens of new titles hit the shelves in preparation for the Christmas market.

Not that Fielding’s novel needed any extra publicity, but the publishing blunder only served to get readers talking even more.

Fans already knew about the main plot twist after extracts were published in the Sunday Times Magazine.

Fans were shocked and upset to learn that hero Mark Darcy is dead and Bridget has become a widow.

The 55-year-old mother of two was seen decked out in gym gear as she headed for a workout near her north London home.

She
 teamed her leggings and sweater with slightly less practical biker 
boots – but would no doubt have kicked them off when she arrived at her 
Pilates class.

In 
interviews to launch the book, Fielding, 55, said chunks of Bridget have
 also been printed in My Life but the publisher declined to reveal how 
many copies were affected.

'Nothing turns out quite perfectly,' said the author, laughing.

More than a decade after the last 
novel in the saga, it turns out that unlucky-in-love Bridget married 
Darcy and gave him two children - only for Fielding to kill off the 
awkward yet successful barrister.

Heralding the arrival of 'chick lit', Bridget Jones’s Diary started life as as a newspaper column in 1995.

Two
 best-selling novels followed, with Hollywood blockbuster film 
adaptations featuring Renee Zellweger as Bridget and Colin Firth as 
Darcy.

Portrayed as a stereotypical 1990s 
London 30-something worried about her weight, smoking and alcohol 
intake, Bridget struck a chord with women of her generation.

The
 modern-day heroine’s story - loosely based on Jane Austen’s Pride And 
Prejudice - was centred around love interests, Darcy and her cad boss 
Daniel Cleaver.

After hearing from her last in 1999 with Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason, readers will now find Bridget as a 51-year-old widow obsessed with wrinkles.

Fielding, who has always denied that the books are autobiographical, is a single mother-of-two who ended her relationship with television executive Kevin Curran in 2009.

Bridget’s new adventures as a 50-something cougar sees her meet new 30-year-old toyboy boyfriend, Roxter, on Twitter, five years after Darcy’s death.

Miss Fielding has revealed she lost the weight by cutting down on carbohydrates, but admitted ‘an addiction’ to Diet Coke.
