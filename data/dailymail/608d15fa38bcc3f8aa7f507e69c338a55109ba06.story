Forget the races, for many Royal Ascot is all about the fashion.

That's why Channel 4 have hired style guru Gok Wan to be their fashion correspondent as the glamorous event begins today.

Clothes expert Gok will be on hand every day to comment on 'who's who' while appraising racegoers' outfits.

Gok's fashion picks: He recommends, clockwise from left, colour-blocking with this vivid yellow number, eccentric prints, modern but still demure and chic lace and a dress and jacket combination for those who want to keep covered up

Attendees must adhere to traditional style rules including wearing skirts and dresses of a 'modest length', dress straps of one inch or greater (no strapless dresses allowed) and hats instead of fascinators.

Gok said fashionistas can stick to the guidelines while still keeping their look on-trend.

He said: 'My career is based on challenging
 tradition, but it's all about taking classic stuff and twisting that. 
When you see women on Gold Cup Day and they're all parading along with 
their avant-garde hats and the latest trends, it's all full of 
tradition.

'The hemlines are to the knee, the arms are covered, there are
 all these rules and regulations. At the same time, there are little 
moments of new trends.'

Style watch: Gok will be the fashion correspondent for Channel 4 at Ascot

This year, his pick of the trends are florals, monochrome and lace.

He said: 'Modern florals ooze femininity. If you're
 an hourglass, look for a dress that has a deep v-neck and synched-in 
waist to make the most of those gorgeous, Marilyn Monroe curves.'

He added: 'For an effortlessly glamorous, classic My
 Fair Lady look, pick monochrome. If you're slim, a figure-hugging dress
 which finishes on or just below the knee will knock 'em dead.'

Jackets and pashminas are allowed in the Royal enclosure and Gok says they are a good option 'if you're worried about putting too much on show – or the British weather.'

Ascot's official style guide stipulates no strapless dresses or fascinators for women and morning suits for men in the royal enclosure. Gok said you can stick to the rules whilst adding a personal twist

He also believes lace will continue to be a big trend at this year's event.

He said: 'If the thought of lace makes you 
think of your gran's net curtains, think again. There are loads of 
gorgeous, modern laces out there which look effortlessly chic. And a 
mesh or sheer material on the sleeves gives a beautiful hint of flesh 
whilst also giving you some coverage.'

When it comes to footwear, he said nude heels, like those favoured by the Duchess of Cambridge, are always a winner.

Be bold: Gok recommends clashing patterns and bold prints like these seen in the official Ascot style guide

On trend: Gok said floral prints like this will be another winner

'A heel will make your legs look gorgeous 
and a pointy toe will make your pins look even longer. Every woman 
should own a pair of black or nude heels – they'll go with everything,' he recommends.

But Gok's style tips aren't just for women. While he said men are more restricted in the Royal Enclosure on how adventurous they can be with their outfit, there are ways to make a morning suit reflect personal taste.

Ahead of the trends: At last year's Ascot, the Queen showcased two of the looks Gok recommends will be big this year - colour-blocking, left, and floral print, right

Never out of fashion: Gok said nude heels, like those seen on the Duchess of Cambridge when she went to Derby Day at Epsom with Princes William and Harry in 2011, are a wise choice

He said: The only things you can use to express
 yourself are your shirt-and-tie combination, and then your cufflinks. 
And then it's more hidden moments - the lining of your waistcoat or your
 jacket – it's all about hidden personality.'

The TV presenter said wearing a morning suit to front the Ascot fashion coverage will be an unusual experience for him.

Take a chance: Of course you can get it wrong, but with clashing patterns, bright colours and bold prints a-plenty, chances are you will probably nail it. So be daring and give it a go, you mightjust surprise yourself!

Get your underwear right: Get your foundations right and everything else should fall into place. Get the support you need in all the right places because that's the last thing you want to worry about on the day!

Size matters: The fit of your clothing has to be right. If you are literally tied up like a turkey ready for basting, you're going to be uncomfortable.

Be on trend: There's going to be a lot of monochrome and quite a lot of colour clash. Floral prints are a huge trend throughout the whole of the summer as well. It's going to feel very beautiful English garden. Of course, there will be the big-brimmed hats as well and this season we've gone very clean and neat with our tailoring, and we've put that on to prints as well. So expect to seeloads and loads of sharp lines.

Royal Ascot is live on Channel 4 from June 17 – 21 and includes seven QIPCO British Champions Series races
