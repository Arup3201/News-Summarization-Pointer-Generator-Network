Paul Ryan is due formally to accept the vice-presidential nomination in a high-stakes speech to the Republican and tell voters that ‘after four years of getting the run-around [under President Barack Obama], America needs a turnaround, and the man for the job is Governor Mitt Romney’.

According to prepared excerpts, the Wisconsin congressman will say: ‘I accept the calling of my generation to give our children the America that was given to us, with opportunity for the young and security for the old – and I know that we are ready. Our nominee is sure ready. His whole life has prepared him for this moment – to meet serious challenges in a serious way, without excuses and idle words.’

The selection of Ryan, 42, a staunch fiscal conservative who advocates tackling America’s national debt crisis head on, including by reforming entitlement programmes like Medicare, has energised Romney’s candidacy and put the state of Wisconsin into play.

Even if he does not win the vice-presidency in November, Ryan – 23 years younger than Romney - is viewed as a star of the next political generation – much as Barack Obama was when he spoke at the 2004 Democratic convention.

In what promises to be a poignant moment, Ryan will recall his father, who died of a heart attack when the future congressman was just 16, saying: ‘My Dad used to say to me, “Son. You have a choice: You can be part of the problem, or you can be part of the solution”.

‘The present administration has made its choices.  And Mitt Romney and I have made ours: Before the math and the momentum overwhelm us all, we are going to solve this nation’s economic problems. And I’m going to level with you: We don’t have that much time.  But if we are serious, and smart, and we lead, we can do this.’

Ryan will also take Obama to task for his health care reform, pushed through in 2010 without a single Republican vote. ‘Obamacare comes to more than two thousand pages of rules, mandates, taxes, fees, and fines that have no place in a free country,’ he is due to say.

‘The president has declared that the debate over government-controlled health care is over.  That will come as news to the millions of Americans who will elect Mitt Romney so we can repeal Obamacare…We have a plan for a stronger middle class, with the goal of generating 12 million new jobs over the next four years.’

He is also planning to say that this election will be decisive and a stark contrast is on offer between Obama and Vice President Joe Biden and the Romney-Ryan ticket.

Big night: Paul Ryan and his wife Janna appear on stage at the Wisconsin delegation's Beers and Brats event on Wednesday

‘The right that makes all the difference now is the right to choose our own leaders. You are entitled to the clearest possible choice because the time for choosing is drawing near.  So here is our pledge. We will not duck the tough issues – we will lead.  

‘We will not spend four years blaming others – we will take responsibility. We will not try to replace our founding principles, we will reapply our founding principles. The work ahead will be hard.  These times demand the best of us – all of us, but we can do this.  Together, we can do this.’

Ahead of his high-profile speech that
 cements his place as Mitt Romney's running mate and introduces him to 
the nation, the congressman spent most of the day with his children, 
keeping his mind elsewhere.

The Midwesterner made a quick visit to the 
cavernous hall and then to a celebration of Wisconsin's beer and brats.

Asked
 by reporters this afternoon about his speech, the typically chatty 
congressman played coy as he tinkered with the height of the podium and 
got used to the echo from the microphones while his three children 
practiced waving to the crowd.

'You'll find out tonight,' Ryan said. 'Why would I spoil it now?'

He
 and his wife then headed to the Wisconsin delegation's Beers and Brats 
event, where he tried to downplay the significance of the speech just a 
few hours away to the thousands in the hall and the millions watching on
 television.

'I've got to give this speech later on today so I'm going to keep it brief and save my voice,' he said.

Ryan said he and Romney would outline their plans for the country in the coming weeks, starting with his own speech.

'We're going to give the country a very clear choice that they deserve,' Ryan said.

Ryan is expected to talk about his Irish immigrant ancestors and small-town values, offering a personal presentation of a lawmaker largely known for sober policy analysis. He will also praise Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, and criticize President Barack Obama.

The speech will likely be heavy on personality and light on policy, the latest example of Ryan deferring to Romney's preferences. As Ryan puts it, Romney is 'the boss.'

That message was underscored in 
Ryan's preparations. Wearing a blazer and open-collar shirt, he asked to
 be shown where Romney will be seated, conscious that he would speak in 
front of the man he hopes will be his future partner.

Ryan
 and his team, a mix of longtime aides and new advisers, have spent a 
chunk of the past few weeks writing - and re-writing - the speech. 
Drafts have been emailed from his campaign plane and his kitchen table 
in Janesville, to speechwriters in Tampa and top Romney advisers at the 
Boston campaign headquarters.

Early versions were scrapped and adjusted to include bits of Ryan's natural, easygoing speaking style. In between campaign events and daily workouts, Ryan has been working to put his own voice into the drafts. He is an experienced speechwriter, having served in that capacity for 1996 vice presidential nominee Jack Kemp and former Education Secretary William Bennett.

But at campaign events, Ryan has tended to favor policy over his personal story. From Ohio to Virginia to Florida, he talks more often about the nation's debt and deficit than his own life as a congressional aide who became a congressman at age 28. The 42-year-old is more comfortable citing Congressional Budget Office statistics than real people.

Romney's aides want that to change. Advisers are pushing Ryan toward more personal territory.

Pulling the heartstrings: The hope among Romney's team is that the nation gets to know Ryan's story, one they say working-class voters could relate to

The hope among Romney's team is that the nation gets to know Ryan's story, one they say working-class voters could relate to. Left unsaid is that Ryan's policy positions, specifically his contentious budget proposals, have caused headaches for Romney and dominated the storyline of the campaign since he was introduced as the running mate.

Ryan planned to talk Wednesday not just about Romney's promises to repair the economy and what they contend are Obama's failures to do so, but also about his own upbringing. A message of self-reliance is set for a prominent role in the speech.

Ryan previewed his message earlier this week at the high school he attended two decades ago. He spoke of his ancestors' journey in the 1850s from Ireland to Wisconsin.

Aides sought to lower expectations and cautioned against expecting a blockbuster speech like the one delivered by 2008 vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin. Instead, Ryan is likely to paint himself as a reasonable governing partner for Romney.
