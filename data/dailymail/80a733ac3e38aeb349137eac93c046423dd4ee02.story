A radical pooled pension proposal could prevent retiring workers using their funds as they please.

Experts say ‘collective defined contribution’ schemes will not qualify for the reforms introduced by George Osborne that allow pension holders to use their funds as a ‘cash machine’.

They were described as ‘unfair and inflexible’ and it was said that they could lead to a poorer retirement for millions.

Pension shock: Experts say 'collective defined contribution' schemes will not qualify for the reforms introduced by George Osborne that allow pension holders to use their funds as a 'cash machine'

Legislation for CDC schemes is expected to be revealed in tomorrow’s Queen’s Speech.

But Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at the advisers Hargreaves Lansdown, was among those warning that workers may not be able to benefit from the freedoms introduced in the Budget. From April next year, anyone aged 55 and over will be able to use their pension as a source of cash.

Mr McPhail, whose claim was disputed by sources at the Department for Work and Pensions, said: ‘Any employer who decided to implement a CDC scheme would have to explain to employees why they can’t take part in the freedom everyone else enjoys.’

In a research note published yesterday, he said: ‘These pensions are unfair and inflexible and there is no demand for them.’

'There are no guarantees': Ros Altmann warned that some CDC members in the Netherlands had no inflation increases for nearly ten years

Dr Ros Altmann, a pensions expert and former Downing Street adviser, agreed and added that pensioners may also lose the guaranteed increase in their pension currently offered.

‘Some CDC members in the Netherlands have had no inflation increases for nearly ten years and then had their pensions cut by about five per cent in the past couple of years,’ she said. ‘People need to understand that there are no guarantees on their pensions in these schemes.’

With a CDC pension, a worker and their boss pay money into a fund every month, but the money is kept in a single pool of assets, rather than an individual fund for each worker.

It is these assets that are used to pay a retirement pension to workers. The size of their payout is determined by actuaries, who are mathematical experts working for insurers.

Dr Altmann fears this could lead to older members getting a better deal than younger people. ‘There are risks that actuaries will not recognize the need to reduce benefits in time and continue to pay out more than is justified because they fail to foresee the future problems,’ she said.

‘In such cases, the older members will have had more than their fair share of the scheme assets, leaving younger members with less pensions than their own contributions would have generated.’

Lee Hollingworth, a partner at the consultancy Hymans Robertson, said: ‘Anything that provides cross-subsidy from one group to another is always likely to result in winners and losers.

‘With CDC, there is the risk that sustained periods of low returns could lead to the young subsidising current retirees.

‘Likewise, those less well-off could subsidise those better off, as they will draw on their benefits for much longer given the difference in life expectancy.’

Steve Webb, the Pensions Minister, said: ‘We have already done much to make private and workplace pension schemes more attractive to workers.

‘But the UK can and must learn from other countries in taking this further and providing workers with a better deal.

‘A consultation on the specific issue of collective pensions is already under way and its findings will be published soon.’
