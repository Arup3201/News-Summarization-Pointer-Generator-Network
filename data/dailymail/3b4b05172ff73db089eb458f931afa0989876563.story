On the day his former employer announced a staggering £2.5billion loss, former Co-op bank boss Paul Flowers was enjoying an all-night drinking session, it has been claimed.

The 63-year-old, who recently underwent a stint in rehab, allegedly invited an escort to his home in Salford, Greater Manchester, in the early hours of last Thursday,   admitting he was 'trolleyed'.

The Co-op's loss announcement comes after its banking division plunged into losses last year with Methodist Minister Flowers at the helm.

He was filmed by The Mail on Sunday allegedly   buying class A drugs in November. In March he spoke about the drugs allegations, saying: 'I have sinned' and admitted to 'frailties' in an interview with BBC's Newsnight.

The escort, 22-year-old Dale Westwood, claims the texts started at 1am and continued until 11am.

The pair had met at a party in Bradford, West Yorkshire, last month. Mr   Westwood claims Mr Flowers has repeatedly asked him to visit him, but he has always refused.

'I can't believe he has been so brazen. Most of the bank's failures are down to him, yet he doesn't have a care in the world.'

Last week Flowers, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, was charged with possession of Class A drugs cocaine and methamphetamine as well as the Class C drug ketamine.

Flowers's solicitor Andrew Hollas said the former bank boss would make a 'full statement' following his appearance at Leeds Magistrates Court on May 7.

The Crown Prosecution Service said it had 'carefully considered' a file of evidence against Flowers before pressing charges.

Mr Westwood added that Flowers says those who put him in charge were 'stupid' and was joking about the news stories surrounding him.

He told the Sun: 'The Co-op are in a bad way and he doesn't recognise how he has been involved in that - he blames anyone but himself.'

Flowers was suspended by both the Methodist Church and the Labour Party following allegations that he bought and used illegal drugs.

Last week Flowers, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, was charged with possession of Class A drugs cocaine and methamphetamine as well as the Class C drug ketamine.

Former City Minister Lord Myners was appointed to assess the Co-op Group's system of elections and appointments.

He resigned last week in the face of bitter resistance from board members but plans to complete his review.  A separate review by Sir Chris Kelly, chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life – an advisory Government body – is looking into how the Co-op Bank came close to   collapse last year.

His report is expected after Easter.  Last week the bank announced a £1.3 billion loss for 2013 and launched an emergency plan to raise £400 million to plug a hole in its finances.

There have been repeated questions about how Flowers was ever put in charge, despite having almost no knowledge of the banking sector. Last year it failed to buy 632 Lloyds TSB branches when a £1.5billion hole was discovered in its finances.

Neville Richardson, the former chief executive of the Co-op Bank, blamed the banks’s problems on the way it managed its loan portfolio after he left, but the banker was contradicted by Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Prudential Regulation Authority, who said the losses mainly derived from assets acquired when the Co-op took over the Britannia Building Society.
