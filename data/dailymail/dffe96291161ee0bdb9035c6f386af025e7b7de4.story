Tracy Morgan was looking greatly improved as he made his way into an appointment at a New Jersey rehab facility on Wednesday afternoon

The actor, who suffered a traumatic brain injury as well as a broken leg, a broken nose and broken ribs, was seen walking with a slight limp

And while Morgan looked greatly improved, he was still forced to take a seat at one point as he waited for his wife and child to exit the car.

This comes a little over a week after Morgan was forced to miss the Saturday Night Live 40th anniversary special, though he was acknowledged for his many contributions to the show in which his 30 Rock castmates Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin introduced one of his most famous characters, the eccentric zoologist Brian Fellows.

Morgan's attorney recently revealed Morgan is still struggling to simply return 'to the way he was' after this trauma. 

Morgan was critically injured in early June when a Wal-Mart tractor-trailer rammed into a limousine bus he and his friends were travelling in on the New Jersey Turnpike.

The comedian was returning home to New York City from a show at a Delaware casino.

Morgan was returning home for a comedy show in Delaware last June when the accident occurred 

He spent almost two months in the hospital and rehab following the accident before he could return home, and the extent of his brain injury is still unknown.

'He's fighting to get better, and if there's a chance for him to be back to the Tracy Morgan he once was, he's going to try to do that,' said his lawyer Benedict Morelli last November.

'But we just don't know because of the severity of the injuries that he sustained and the fact that he had such a severe brain injury.'

The actor did appear much better than the last time he was spotted earlier this month walking to a New York hospital with his fiancee.

The driver of the tractor-trailer thatallegedly  caused the accident, Kevin Roper, was charged with death by auto and four counts of assault by auto in a New Jersey state court

Morgan has also filed a lawsuit against Wal-Mart

The driver of the tractor-trailer, Kevin Roper, was charged with death by auto and four counts of assault by auto in a New Jersey state court.

Last December, Morgan and his attorneys accused Wal-Mart of stalling in a federal lawsuit they have brought against the company over their safety practices after it was reported that Roper was asleep at the wheel at the time of the crash.

Following the incident, Roper took to Twitter to deny claims he was under the influence at the time of the accident, saying; 'I was never charged at the scene of the accident because once again i was not guilty of any crime. Not until all the TV cameras came.'

The Georgia resident also stated that he felt 'horrible' and 'wished it was him who was hurt' before writing; 'So yes i am now most likely f****d because i had an unfortunate ACCIDENT with the wrong car that night.' 

Roper recently asked a judge to delay Morgan's lawsuit against Wal-Mart until his criminal case in New Jersey is settled.

Morgan was forced to put an FX series he had in development on hold after the accident, though his new film with Chris Rock, Take Five, was released in December.

He came out against Wal-Mart in a public statement this past September after they accused him of being at fault during the accident for not wearing a seatbelt.

'I can't believe Walmart is blaming me for an accident they caused,' he said at the time.

'I'm fighting hard every day to get back.'
