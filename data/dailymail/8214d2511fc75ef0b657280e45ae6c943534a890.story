Spanish sporting connections will loom large for Andy Murray on Friday afternoon as he faces Roberto Bautista Agut on the latest stage of his Wimbledon odyssey.

Not only will the defending champion tackle the country’s fourth-ranked player to try to make the last 16, but Murray has also revealed that he has invested in the new film about the life of Spanish icon Seve Ballesteros, which is released on Friday.

The 27-year-old Scot, whose fortune is estimated at around £40million, has used some of that cash to back the biopic of the great golfer, partly for sentimental reasons (and doubtless for some tax efficiency): ‘I normally try to invest in something that interests me a little bit. I watched a lot of golf when I was younger,’ he said.

‘I remember going to the tournament at Glen-eagles, which was near us. I know my dad was a massive Ballesteros fan – he loved watching him and used to talk about him a lot when we were growing up. I get asked about a number of investment opportunities and that was something to me that made sense.’

Murray’s attempts at playing golf, never that wholehearted, have ground to a halt for now, as have his days of being a bandit: ‘I stopped playing when I started having back problems.

'When I used to play for money, I always used to play off 16, everyone got p****d off when I was playing against them. I have never lost a game of golf for money. I don’t know what my handicap was exactly but that is what I used to play off.

‘My brother Jamie got down to three when he was 16 or 17. He doesn’t play too much now.’ Murray will be far more preoccupied with tackling the world No 23 as he returns to Centre Court in his usual primetime slot of late afternoon.

Bautista Agut has bloomed curiously late in his mid-20s from being an unknown journeyman to entering the top 30, and he presents a danger as he comes in having won last week’s ATP Tour event on grass in Holland.

The seven-match winning streak has seen him beat useful grass-court players such as Nicolas Mahut and Benjamin Becker, and his game is more suited to the surface than many Spaniards.

He will not hold too many surprises for Murray, as the pair know each other from training spells in Valencia, where they have attended La Liga matches together. In fact both had the chance to choose football over tennis when younger.

‘I was a striker at Villarreal and while nobody from my time at the club really made it, I know a lot of the players there just now,’ said Bautista Agut. ‘I made the right choice when I opted to become a tennis player although I think I would have more chance of beating Andy at football.

‘We practice quite a lot together and we always talk about football rather than tennis.’
