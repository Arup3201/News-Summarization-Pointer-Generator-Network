The plot that turned into Australia’s biggest match-fixing scandal was hatched between Hastings, Sussex and Singapore in late 2012 and was blown apart last September when 10 people, including a group of English footballers, were arrested in Melbourne for alleged involvement in throwing games.

In the days and weeks running up to the bust, police had almost outnumbered fans at some games played by a local league side, Southern Stars, watching and listening for evidence of manipulation.

Emboldened by new laws, which meant they could wire-tap suspects’ phones, they had also bugged the club, including the pitch and even the goalposts. They collected evidence including calls arranging fixes, discussions about cash transfers and yells between team-mates during play along the lines: ‘Let this one in!’

The state police in Victoria duly laid fixing charges. Prosecutions have unfolded over the past eight months and convictions have been secured across a series of court dates, now drawing to a close.

Four English footballers pleaded guilty to fixing with the Stars and three have been punished, all with fines. Joe Woolley, a 24-year-old goalkeeper, was fined £675. 

Ringleader: Gerry Subramaniam, involved in the global match-fixing scam involving players at the Southern Stars Football Club

Reiss Noel, a 24-year-old defender, was fined £1,126. David Obaze, a 25-year-old defender, was fined £1,700. Nick McKoy, 27, a midfielder, is scheduled to have a sentencing hearing this month. The four have all been banned for life from football by FIFA.

As recently as spring of last year, they were all playing in England, in the 2012-13 Conference South season. Woolley, Noel and McKoy were at Hornchurch and Obaze at Eastbourne Borough.

Gerry Subramaniam, a Singapore-based Malaysian, was given a three-year prison sentence in April for his ringleader role. The Stars’ Australian coach, Zia Younan, was given a suspended four-month sentence and a £1,700 fine this month. 

The court proceedings in Melbourne heard the Englishmen were nominally ‘hired’ via a firm called Match World Sports Ltd (MWSL). Documents at Companies House in London show it was registered in December 2012 to an address in Berkeley Square, Mayfair.

The sole owner-director was a British man of Sri Lankan heritage called Krishna Sanjey Ganeshan, from Hastings. He had previously lived for almost 10 years near Wembley.

Ganeshan was tracked going in and out of Australia during the fixing at Southern Stars but left the country before he could be apprehended. It transpired he was in cahoots with a major international match-fixer, Wilson Raj Perumal. MWSL was nothing much more than a shell, a front to pretend it was hiring footballers for legitimate jobs. It was never based in Berkeley Square, never filed accounts and was struck off as a company a few weeks ago.

The English players’ stories act as a cautionary tale of how easy it is to fall into bad company and illegal behaviour. Their football careers are over, although they can consider themselves fortunate they did not end up in prison.

Culprit: Singaporean match-fixer, Wilson Raj Perumal, responsible for hundreds of fixed matches

Under new laws introduced last year in Victoria, those guilty of match-fixing can be handed jail terms of up to 10 years. Associates of the convicted players say they regret what happened but the players themselves have either declined to talk or not responded to requests to do so. 

Ganeshan’s identity has only briefly been aired in public in relation to Australia. Anyone who recognises his name probably does so because he was arrested in England last November for fixing-related activity here and in June was sent to prison for five years for that.

The president of Southern Stars, Ercan Cicek, was first approached by email in 2012 with an offer of five free English players and a free coach, as part of a package where the providers would hope to bring sponsorship to the club and make money.

He told local media later: ‘Our committee members are thinking, “Oh beautiful, five players for free, we’re not going to pay anything, it’s a big, big bonus”.’

He did not suspect anything, he told police.

The state of Victoria was probably about the worst place in the world last summer to embark on a fixing venture. First, new legislation had just come into force which gave police powers that included allowing ‘intrusive’ surveillance. 

Second, a Swiss-based monitoring company with London offices, Sportradar, had been tracking odd movements of players from England to Australia, via paid-for holidays in Bali, then irregular betting and results.

The court was told that Noel said to police he once got a call on the sidelines during play from a fixer saying: ‘This result better f**king happen’ and so he walked behind Woolley’s goal to urge him to concede again. ‘Let the next one in,’ he yelled on one occasion.

The players’ travel costs to Australia and accommodation was covered by the fixers, plus about £1,000 per month each for expenses, plus £1,500 per fix. It is estimated the players cost about £15,000 each for the duration, maximum.

Yet sources say that the Singapore-based fixing syndicate behind the scam made about £1.2m profit from the venture, or about £200,000 per match.

It seemed easy money, in an obscure league, unlikely to be noticed. Until they were caught.

Krishna Sanjey Ganeshan

British citizen of Sri Lankan heritage who was jailed in June for five years for a conspiracy to fix matches played in England in November 2013.

Former long-term resident of north London, near Wembley, and latterly Hastings, he was also involved in fixing syndicate working in Australia last year.

Chann Sankaran

Convicted and jailed along with Sanjey Ganeshan of conspiracy to commit bribery relating to matches in November 2013.

Gerry Subramanlam

Jailed for ringleader role in Aussie fixing and linked to Wilson Raj Perumal and Sanjey Ganeshan.

Wilson Raj Perumal

Singaporean match-fixer, responsible for hundreds of fixed matches around the world at club and international level. Lived in north London near Wembley in the past.

Conference South 2012-13

FA made public announcement in March 2013, reminding 22 clubs of ‘responsibilities’ after suspicious betting patterns, and a dossier from experts identified clubs, games and players believed to be involved in match manipulation. No investigation after police declined to get involved.

Victoria League, Australia

The biggest fixing scandal in Australian history unfolded a year ago at Southern Stars FC in Melbourne.

Convictions have been secured for a group of fixers controlled by a Singapore-based syndicate, including four English players, all former Conference South players.

Various matches in England, Nov 2013

Sanjey Ganeshan and associate Chann Sankaran, a Singaporean fixer, were jailed in June 2014 at Birmingham Crown Court after being found guilty of a conspiracy to commit bribery in a case that centred on English football matches played in November 2013. Both men got five years.
