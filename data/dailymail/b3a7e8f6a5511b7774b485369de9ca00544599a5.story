Danny Rose believes Harry Redknapp deserves a warm welcome this weekend when he makes his first return to White Hart Lane since being sacked by Tottenham.

Over the course of nearly four years in north London, the 67-year-old transformed Spurs from relegation candidates to regular Champions League contenders.

It was the most successful period of Spurs' recent history but Redknapp was shown the door in June 2012 after a promising season tailed off amid widespread links to the England hotseat.

Return: Redknapp will be back at White Hart Lane on Sunday, where he spent four successful years

Respect: Redknapp should get a good reception according to Rose after his achievements with Spurs

Andre Villas-Boas and Tim Sherwood have come and gone since then, with Redknapp still the only man to have led Spurs into the Champions League.

It is that success which makes Rose confident that the sometimes divisive, always outspoken manager will get a decent welcome when he brings QPR to White Hart Lane on Sunday.

'He was one of the most successful managers the club has had, with him getting the club into the Champions League, so he should get a good reception,' said the left-back.

'In terms of the football he had the team playing, he got the best out of Luka Modric, the best out of Gareth Bale, and lot of players, so I think he should get a warm welcome.

'QPR lost against Hull on the opening day of the season but we know it will be a difficult game.

Spurs connection: Redknapp and coach Glenn Hoddle are both former Tottenham manager

Up against it: Rose says it will be a difficult game against QPR but hopes his side can pick up the win

'With an old manager coming back, they will be looking to get three points. It will be a very hard game but games at home we should be looking to get three points.'

Victory against QPR would continue a fine start to life at the helm for Mauricio Pochettino.

Coaxed to White Hart Lane after an impressive 18 months at Southampton, the QPR match will be the former Argentina defender's first competitive match at White Hart Lane and comes fresh from leading Spurs to back-to-back victories at West Ham and AEL Limassol.

'I spoke to Jack Cork at Southampton before I met the manager and he had nothing but nice things to say about him,' Rose said.

'It is hard work but I am enjoying working under him. He is like one of the lads, having a laugh, but everyone knows that as soon as training starts he is very serious.

'All he demands is hard work and that is exactly what he has got form everyone throughout pre-season.'

Flying start: Pochettino has enjoyed an impressive opening two games with wins against West Ham and AEL

Pochettino's demanding approach is well-documented and one which Spurs will hope bears fruit as they take on QPR just days after an energy-sapping trip to Cyprus.

A bobbly, cut-up pitch and temperatures in the 30s made life difficult for the north Londoners, who looked set to lose to an early AEL goal from Adrian Sardinero in the first leg of their Europa League play-off.

However, the introduction of Erik Lamela midway through the second half turned the game, the schemer setting up Roberto Soldado and Harry Kane within eight minutes of coming on to secure an unlikely 2-1 win.

Having a laugh: Erik Lamela is beginning to settle in at Tottenham and his performances are improving

It was a belated glimpse of the quality which saw Tottenham fork out a club-record fee last summer and, after a difficult debut season, Rose is confident the Argentinian will prove his worth this term.

'We were allowed a night out in America and we all saw a different side to him,' he said.

'He really came out of his shell and was having a laugh and a joke with everybody.

'I was warming up with him last night and you could tell he was raring to get on the pitch.

'He did well to assist Robbie for the first and then was involved in the second. We are all happy for him.

'He has got a lot of quality, especially going forward. He will be looking forward to showing everyone what he can do this season.'
