As most kids were spending their school break heading off on vacation or sitting at home, Ashima Shiraishi was busy breaking some very longstanding world records.

The 13-year-old from New York City has become the newest, and youngest, rock star in the world of rock climbing, and prove just how amazing she was with one very difficult climb.

By conquering Open Your Mind Direct, a notoriously difficult rock wall in Santa Linya, Spain. she became the first woman and the youngest person ever to make it up the challenging crag.

And it only took her about 10 minutes.

'I was really excited and happy,' Ashima told The Huffington Post after her big climb.

'For every hard climb, especially Open Your Mind Direct, the hardest part is the mental game.'

What's more, the already daunting climb was made even harder as the climb became even harder since a key hold, which climbers use to attach themselves to the wall as they move up the face, has broken off a while back, and since then no one has been able to successfully complete the climb, which is rated a 5.15a.

No one, that is, until Ashima.

And like most kids her age, she celebrated her victory the best way she knew how - with ice cream.

Ashima, who says she loves to hang out with friends and eat when she is not rock climbing, celebrated her big climb with some ice cream

The daughter of Japanese immigrants, who began climbing when she was just 6, is ready for more challenges now, and knows that she and other girls can handle them just as well as the boys.

She said; 'I think that now it’s not always the guys that are pushing the limits; it's also girls who are strong and focused and inspired to climb.'
