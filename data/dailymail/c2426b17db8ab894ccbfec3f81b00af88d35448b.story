Steven Dunks, 45, was told he must serve a minimum of 19 years behind bars after being convicted of the murder of Lynn Howarth in Oldham, Greater Manchester

A spurned lover who battered his ex-girlfriend to death in a jealous rage and then used her phone to pretend she was still alive was jailed for life today.

Steven Dunks was told he would serve a minimum of 19 years behind bars for the brutal murder of former partner Lynn Howarth, 43.

The jealous 45-year-old flew into a drunken rage and beat Miss Howarth to death after she started seeing another man. 

Just days before the killing he had issued a chilling warning to his former partner, telling her he would 'rather see her dead before seeing her with someone else.' 

After the murder he stole Miss Howarth's mobile sim and bank cards in a bid to cover up his crime and trick her family into believing she was still alive.

Her decomposed body was discovered a month after the brutal killing when neighbours alerted police of a strong smell coming from the property.

Manchester Crown Court heard the couple had a volatile on-and-off relationship for around 18 months.

Miss Howarth told friends that she had split up with Dunks after learning that he was seeing another woman behind her back.

In July last year the agoraphobic met a new man online and he became a regular visitor to her flat.

The jury heard that a drunken Dunks appeared at her flat on July 18, to confront his ex and her new partner, saying he would 'rather see her dead before seeing her with someone else.'

Just nine days after the threat he returned to the property for a second time and launched the violent attack.

Miss Howarth's injuries were so severe that her jaw bone had become detached from the rest of her skull.

Dunks then stole her phone sim  and bank card and spent the next month speaking to Miss Howarth's new partner and mother via Facebook and text messages in a bid to cover his tracks.

Her body was discovered on August 26 - along with a blood-stained glove that was covered in Dunks' DNA.He was arrested the following day.

Dunks of Oldham, Greater Manchester, had denied murder but  a jury disbelieved his version of events and found him guilty.

Speaking after the sentence Detective Chief Inspector Richard Eales of Greater Manchester Police said: 'Dunks was quite happy to string along two women at the same time.

'But the thought of her moving on with her life and finding a new partner sent him into a terrible rage.

'He ended her life in one of the most violent ways I have seen as a detective. He used enough force to cause catastrophic damage to her head and face.

'He then left her body to rot in the home they had shared, taking her sim card and cash cards with him so he could steal her money and trick her friends and family into thinking she was still alive.

'Lynn was limited by her anxiety and fear of open spaces, she did not travel far from her flat and her social life was led mainly online and through mobile phone.

'Dunks knew that and that is why he thought to try and cover his tracks by using her Facebook account and mobile phone to contact the people who were going to be most worried about her.

Miss Howarth's body was found at the flat she once shared with Dunks in Heywood, Rochdale, a month after her brutal murder

'Think of what that have must have been like for her mother, thinking that she was exchanging text messages with her daughter when in reality she was communicating with the man who had brutally murdered Lynn weeks earlier.

'I hope this sentence can go some way to comforting Lynn's family during this tremendously difficult time.' 

Rob Hall, Senior Crown Advocate for CPS North West, said: 'Today, Steven Dunks has been jailed for a minimum of 19 years for committing a brutal murder.

'Lynn Howarth had recently ended the relationship with him and was beginning to move on with her life.

'However Dunks became jealous and controlling, ultimately threatening that he would rather see her dead than see her with anyone else.

'He savagely beat her to death inside her own flat and then left her body in situ whilst he withdrew cash from her bank account and used her Blackberry mobile phone to look at pornographic websites.

'To maintain the impression that Lynn Howarth was still alive he pretended to be Lynn and engaged in an unpleasant text conversation on her Blackberry with her mother.

'Throughout the case Steven Dunks has denied he was responsible for the murder, but after the jury have carefully considered all the evidence, they have found him unanimously guilty of the murder.

'He must now face the consequences of his actions as he begins this prison sentence.'
