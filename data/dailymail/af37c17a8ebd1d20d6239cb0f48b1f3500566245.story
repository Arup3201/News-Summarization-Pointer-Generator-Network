A brave 8-year-old boy with Down Syndrome who successfully battled cancer got to fist bump all the players on the hockey team The Boston Bruins on Tuesday night.

Footage of the adorable exchange between Liam Fitzgerald and the players on the Bruins went viral with nearly 1 million views and it's no surprise.

Liam smiled over and over again as he reached out his tiny fist towards the Bruins  before their 2-1 win over the Florida Panthers after they finished their pre-game warmups.

Fist Bump!: Lucky Liam Fitzgerald, 8, got to fist bump all of the players on the Bruins on Tuesday night 

Bumped off cancer: Liam Fitzgerald is a brave boy with Down Syndrome who battled cancer for three years

The Obnoxious Boston Fan column on Boston.com reports that Liam was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia when he was just four-years-old.

After three and a half years of battling the grueling illness he won the war and made some amazing friends along the way.

Liam is a huge sports fan and the Bruins and the Red Sox were there for him during the best and the worst of his illness.

Liam visited Fenway Park this past summer as a guest of starting pitcher Clay Buchholz, and joined Buchholz and company at the annual Buchholz Bowl in July.

Boston.com reports that Liam's true love is for the Boston Bruins and he even dressed up as defenseman Adam McQuaid for Halloween last year.

Small but brave: Liam Fitzgerald is small for his age and will take growth hormones every day until he turns 18

Meeting the team: Liam gets to meet Patrice Bergeron for the second time on Tuesday night right after they finished their pre-game warm-ups before playing the Florida Panthers 

Popular guy: Liam Fitzgerald has his own fans and is friendly with the Bruins mascot and other affiliates 

The Massachusetts Down Syndrome Congress, who has a partnership with the Bruins Foundation for an annual charity fundraiser, told McQuaid that Liam is a big fan of his.

When McQuaid learned about his biggest fan, he invited Liam and his family to a Bruins game last February.

Liam was ecstatic when he met Milan Lucic, Patrice Bergeron, Brad Marchand, and now-former Bruins Johnny Boychuk and Shawn Thornton.

'It not the attention, it’s the smile they bring to his face,' his mom, Christine Fitzgerald, told Boston.com.

'I watch what the Bruins do at Children’s Hospital. The athletes take the gift they have of their fame down to a personal level. It goes beyond their hockey skill set and shows they are human. Giving back. Sharing their gift with others,' she added.

Liam  enjoys attending games and loves asking the players questions his mom told Boston.com.

'What are the keys to the game?’ That’s probably what he asked Bergeron,' Christine Fitzgerald said.

Fitzgerald said that the Bruins players have been nothing but kind to Liam who knows each of their names and all of their positions. 

'He wishes he could skate,' Christine Fitzgerald said.

Liam is small for his age and will soon be taking growth hormone every day until he turns 18, said his mother.

'He’s so small and cute,' his mom said.

'He recognizes the players. But he’s not a three-year-old. He knows who these guys are, their positions. He understands the game.'

On the team?: Liam would love to learn how to Skate so that he could play ice hockey like the Bruins

Thankful: Liam Fitzgerald is appreciative of all the love and support from his favorite Boston team
