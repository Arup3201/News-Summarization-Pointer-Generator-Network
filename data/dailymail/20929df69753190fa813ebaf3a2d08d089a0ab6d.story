She has wowed audiences with her high-energy dance routines and incredibly toned physique.

And now X Factor finalist Fleur East has revealed to Femail the secrets behind her incredible body - gallons of coconut water and lots of bottom exercises.

'I’m such a gym freak,' confesses the 26-year-old Londoner, speaking  from the contestants' house. 'I’m usually in the gym five days a week.'

On Saturday night, the X Factor front-runner received rave reviews from the judges and subsequently on social media for her high-octane performance of Uptown Funk

No wonder she managed to strut her stuff on the ITV show on Saturday night wearing a red PVC dress followed by tiny hotpants and a black crop top without a wobble in sight.

With a gruelling rehearsal schedule, Fleur admits that gym time has fallen by the wayside  but says, 'I've been eating a lot healthier to compensate'.

So what goes into her body to help her look so good? 'I've been hyper-conscious about staying away from rubbish. I don’t eat white bread, white rice or cereal unless it’s porridge.'

But the finalist, who makes herself beans and eggs on toast for breakfast every morning, says crazy dieting isn't her style. 'I would never totally deny myself any specific type of food.' 

'I also love coconut water,' Fleur says. 'I have it all through the day – it's so hydrating and even better than water.'

The moment Fleur discovered the public had voted her through on Saturday

She adds: 'Every morning I take a dose of Baroca too, which gives me an energy boost and is full of vitamin C.'

Fleur's usual workout involves lots of exercise classes and running.

'I do body conditioning, spinning and yoga,' she says. 'On the treadmill I’ll do intervals of running flat and then on incline. I'll do that for an hour.

'I find the running is amazing for my abs.' 

And what about that very toned derriere?

'I do loads of squats with weights,' she says. 'It's great for your bum and legs.'

On Saturday night, the X Factor front-runner received rave reviews from the judges and subsequently on social media for her high-octane performance of Uptown Funk, a track from Mark Ronson's upcoming album, and admits she felt something special in the studio.

'It was incredible – I never expected this kind of reaction,' she admits. 'It's the first time I’ve ever felt anything like that from the audience. As soon as I stepped up there, the roar in that room – wow. I kept telling myself just enjoy it.'

'For my Tina Turner performance  I was originally wearing a massive hat (pictured left during rehearsals), but Simon took one look and said, "Hmmm, I don’t like that hat", so I lost it'. Pictured right during the live shows

But Fleur says: 'I’m not going to lie. Initially when Simon suggested changing the song, I thought, "This is a huge risk". Simon suggested I take five minutes to think about it and call him back.

'I was standing on the street outside the rehearsal and I was waiting for a sign. Then suddenly from nowhere I heard this funk song playing - and I thought I have to go for it.

'When I went back into the rehearsal room and told the music team I was going for it, they all cheered. I only had Friday afternoon to learn the dance routine but I decided not to stress and enjoy it.'

The decision paid off as Fleur sailed straight through to the finals on Sunday's results show. 

The black and gold gettup was also her favourite outfit of the competition. 'I was comfortable and I thought it was sexy but classy - and I loved the gold jacket and gold jewellery.'

Fleur describes her  style as 'street chic' and loves gold jewellery (left) and patterned leggings (right)

Over the past eight weeks, the finalist has appeared on stage in shiny bodycon dresses, leather catsuits, eeny weeny shorts and mega heels - but says she's lapped up every minute of playing dress-up. Even Simon has got involved in the style stakes.

'For my Tina Turner performance two weeks ago I was originally  wearing a massive hat. But Simon took one look and said, "Hmmm, I don’t like that hat", so I lost it.

'One thing Simon always comments on is my hair. Whenever I wear it natural, he always says, "I like your hair like that, you should always wear like that".' 

But behind the scenes there's a man even more influential than Simon in Fleur's life - her French fashion designer boyfriend Marcel Robin, who has previously dressed the likes of Rita Ora and Chris Brown.

'He knows me best,' Fleur says. 'He knows what I’m comfortable with and gives me great advice. Sometimes he’ll send me an image of something he likes and I’ll try to put together something similar.

'He also helped me plan my audition outfit. He said, "You need to stand out" and found this colourful jacket for me online. And it worked. The judges first comments were, "Wow - do you always dress like that?"' 

Fleur has turned heads in the style stakes, showing she can do casual (left) and super glamorous (right) 

So does she? 'No way! When I'm off stage, I’ll mix high fashion and normal high street for a "street chic" look. I’ll wear white skinny jeans, a pair of heels and a leather jacket or I'll match patterned leggings with a long coat.

'I always accessorise with gold jewellery too - I wear gold hoops and my gold Fleur chain.'

With the finals just one week away, the stylish contestant says she's been waiting a lifetime for this moment to arrive.

Breakfast: Scrambled eggs and beans on a slice of brown toast

Lunch: Chicken with salad and vegetables

Dinner: Fish and brown rice

Snack: Dried fruit and nuts

'I've had times when I've been sitting at home and nothing happening,' she explains.

'I was at a really low point at the beginning of this year and was considering giving up and getting a regular job. I thought, "I’m 26 years old. If it was going to happen, it would have happened by now". 

'I would make little videos and demos and hope the right person would see it but when nothing happens, it’s really demoralising.

'I used to do a lot of backing singing - especially for DJ fresh – but I'd just be wishing that one day it would be me.'

On Saturday night, X Factor viewers will decide whether Fleur will finally have the chance to take that talent all the way to the recording studio.
