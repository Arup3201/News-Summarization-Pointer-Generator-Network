English Heritage is hoping to recruit an army of volunteers to help survey some of the country's 345,000 Grade II listed buildings in a bid to stop further damage being inflicted on dozens of structures each year.

From next year, the organisation hopes that volunteers will cover every building of interest from barns to libraries, private homes and factories, in a bid to compile the first ever comprehensive list detailing the condition of all England's listed heritage.

English Heritage announced the drive to recruit people as it launched its 2013 Heritage at Risk Register.

Under threat: Sandycombe Lodge in Twickenham, south west London, has been put on the English Heritage at Risk Register and is in need of a £2million pound refit.

Historic: The listed house was built by painter JMW Turner as a country retreat for him and his father

Tired: The building has been declared at risk of decay or neglect by the English Heritage and needs an urgent refit

The register reveals that 5,700 listed buildings are at risk from decay or neglect.

That number has fallen by 131 since last year, but English Heritage wants to remove a quarter of the entries from the list by 2015.

A pilot scheme using 350 volunteers in areas including Whitehaven, South Tyneside, Hartlepool, Leeds and Worcester, saw some 5,000 Grade II buildings visually surveyed.

Simon Thurley, chief executive of English Heritage, said volunteering was a chance to help save a historic building or improve a conservation area.

He said: 'For English Heritage it means we will eventually get, for the first time, a complete picture of the condition of all England's listed heritage.

'We can use this information to decide how best to deploy our national expertise to help owners and all those tackling heritage at risk on the ground.' 

Important role: Sandycombe Lodge was built in 1813 and later served as a 'shadow factory' producing airmen's uniforms

In need of attention: Some restoration on the damaged home has already begun with English Heritage hoping to reduce its at risk register by 25 per cent by 2015

At risk: Oldknow's Limekilns in Marple, Greater Manchester, dating from 1800, but now derelict, has been added to the English Heritage under threat list this year

Buildings added to the at risk register this year include Sandycombe Lodge, in Richmond, south-west London, currently undergoing restoration, which was built by the artist JMW Turner for his father in 1813 and later served as a 'shadow factory' producing airmen's uniforms.

Other sites added this year to the register include Oldknow's Limekilns in Marple, Greater Manchester, dating from 1800, but now derelict, and Green Lane Works in Sheffield, empty since 2009 but now with a 'promising' future as it undergoes a £13 million redevelopment.

Baker's Hole, a palaeolithic site in Dartford, Kent, home to the earliest Neanderthals in Britain and later a chalk quarry, and described as 'overgrown and overrun with animals', is also added to the register.

Under the sea: The wreck of HMS Invincibles, which sank in the 18th Century of the Hampshire coast is also listed as at risk

English Heritage said a partnership between itself and Natural England had led to the rescue and removal of 97 sites from the risk register in the last year.

These include the remains of lead mines in County Durham and Cumbria, the largest and most important Roman town in northern East Anglia, a 13th century moated manor in Staffordshire and the park and gardens of a country house in Dorset.

Other sites taken off the register include St Barnabas Church in Erdington, Birmingham, ravaged by fire in 2007 but now brought back to life by a 'determined' local community; Townhead Mansion in Slaidburn, Lancashire, now successfully restored after years of neglect; and Holy Well at Trellil, Helston, Cornwall, dating back to the 15th century and now restored and repaired.
