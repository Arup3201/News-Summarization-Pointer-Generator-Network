A woman made four increasingly desperate 999 calls after her husband became ill with chest pains, eventually telling the operator: ‘It’s too late now, he’s gone.’

Fred Pring, 74, died of heart failure while waiting almost an hour for an ambulance after paramedics initially refused to attend because they were due a break, an inquest heard yesterday.

In a string of harrowing calls the retired gardener’s wife Joyce, 63, had begged the emergency service for help for her husband.

By the time paramedics arrived more than 50 minutes after the first call it was too late.

Delays in A&E meant paramedics had had to wait up to 99 minutes to hand over patients to hospital staff, and there were no ambulances available.

When a crew was found they refused to attend because they were due a break.

Only when Mrs Pring rang to say her husband had died and her 999 call was flagged at the most serious level did they agree to go to her aid.

John Gittins, coroner for North East Wales, heard that the ambulance service was ‘extremely busy’ on the night Mr Pring died and their response was almost 45 minutes slower than the target time of eight minutes for life-threatening cases.

Mrs Pring first called 999 just before 1.10am on March 21 last year after her husband (pictured) complained of chest pains at their home

The inquest was told by Mr Pring’s cardiologist, Raj Thaman, that he might have survived if paramedics had arrived soon after the first call, but by the time of the second it was unlikely he would have lived.

Mrs Pring, a retired civil servant, first called 999 just before 1.10am on March 21 last year after her husband, who suffered from several serious conditions including heart failure, complained of chest pains at their home in Mynydd Isa, near Mold.

The operator reassured Mrs Pring that an ambulance was on the way.

Nine minutes later – at 1.19am – Mr Pring’s condition worsened and his wife called 999 again. Mr Pring could be heard groaning as his wife told the operator: ‘He’s in very severe pain, he’s having trouble breathing. I just want someone to help.’ Mrs Pring told the hearing: ‘I could see the panic in his face, the fear in his eyes. He kept saying: ‘‘Tell them to hurry up’’.’

In the third call, 19 minutes later at 1.38am, Mrs Pring told the operator: ‘I can’t make it any more urgent… I keep phoning back but nothing changes.’

Soon afterwards her husband stopped breathing and died, Mrs Pring told the hearing. ‘At 1.45am he said he couldn’t take any more,’ she said. ‘He said: ‘‘I’m going’’ and slumped back on the pillow, stopped breathing and just passed away.’

She called 999 for the final time, at 1.51am, telling the operator: ‘This is the fourth time I’ve rung for an ambulance, it’s too late now, he’s gone.’

Mrs Pring told the inquest at Ruthin, North Wales, that the female operator in the final call showed a ‘considerable’ lack of compassion. Ten minutes after the call three ambulances, two from the Welsh Ambulance Service and one from the North West Ambulance Service, arrived at the couple’s home.

In a statement Michael Bennett, one of the first paramedics to arrive, said they had experienced ‘considerable delays’ at the A&E department of Wrexham Maelor Hospital on a previous call when they had waited 99 minutes to hand over a patient to staff.

They left the hospital at 1.32am and received a ‘red two’ call – the second most serious – but had been on shift for six hours without a break, so ‘politely declined’ to help. Paramedics are supposed to receive a 30 minute break every three hours.

A short time later Mr Bennett and a colleague got a ‘red one’ call, the most serious and agreed to forgo their break. The inquest continues.

A statement released last night by Mrs Pring’s solicitor said she was ‘haunted’ by the 999 calls and was unable to listen to them in court, but she believes her husband was let down by a systemic failure and does not seek to blame any individual.

Operator asks for her full address

Mrs Pring: ‘This is the fourth time I’ve rung for an ambulance, it’s too late now, he’s gone.’

Operator: ‘Are you with him now.’

Mrs Pring: ‘There’s not much point now, he’s dead.’

Operator: ‘How old is he?’

Mrs Pring:  ‘He was 74.’

Operator: ‘Is he awake?’

Mrs Pring: ‘No’

Operator: ‘Is he breathing?’

Mrs Pring: ‘No.’

Operator: ‘Alright, what happened?’

Mrs Pring; ‘He just couldn’t take the pain anymore and couldn’t breathe anymore.’

Operator: ‘Okay, I’m organising help for you now.’

Mrs Pring: ‘There’s nothing I can do now for him, he’s just lying on the bed.’

Operator urges Mrs Pring to help her husband by laying him flat on his back on the floor.

Mrs Pring: ‘I can’t do that, there’s nobody here, he’s died.’

Operator:  ‘Are there any neighbours that can help you?’

Mrs Pring: ‘No, there’s nothing I can do, he’s dead.’

Operator: ‘I can tell you how to help him.’

Mrs Pring: ‘You’re too late, I’m sorry.’

Operator: ‘Are you wanting to help your husband?

Mrs Pring: ‘Just let him go. He was in pain, I do not want him to suffer. It’s not that I do not want to help him, he’s gone.’

Operator: ‘Let’s help him together.’

Mrs Pring: ‘I can’t he’s gone. Don’t you understand? I don’t want to get him back to suffer more.’

Operator: ‘When did he stop breathing?'

Mrs Pring: ‘Two minutes ago.’

Operator: ‘Just follow my instructions, you don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do.’

Mrs Pring: ‘I just want someone to come and take him, it’s nearly an hour…What are your target times?’

Operator: ‘What do you mean…we try to get to patients as quickly as possible.’

Mrs Pring: ‘Well, you haven’t succeeded this time.’
