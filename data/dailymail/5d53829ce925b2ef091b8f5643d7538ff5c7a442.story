Roll up for our Christmas lunch with a galaxy of stars from the worlds of showbusiness and drama. We’re delighted that the hugely popular broadcasters Nicholas Parsons and Sir Terry Wogan and the distinguished actress Sheila Hancock will entertain us with stories of their lives and books under the benign and witty stewardship of our master of ceremonies, Gyles Brandreth.

After a long career as an actor and radio personality Nicholas Parsons CBE is the much loved chairman of Just A Minute — the show he has hosted since the very first programme went out in December 1967. His genial and relaxed manner belies a razor-sharp professionalism, honed over 65 years as a successful actor and a brilliant quiz show host on series including Sale Of The Century, which achieved a record 21 million viewers. His new book, Welcome To Just A Minute, is described by regular contestant Paul Merton as ‘a joyous compendium of facts, fun and stories’.

Chat show Sir Terry Wogan has been delighting his TOGs (Terry’s Old Geezers/Gals) on Radio 2 for many years, reaching audiences of over 8 million. Often described as ‘a living national treasure’ he has fronted everything from his eponymous television chat show to Blankety Blank and Children in Need, not to mention the Eurovision Song Contest where he was famous for his teasingly irreverent style of presentation. The author of many books, his latest, The Little Book Of Common Sense — our hero’s view on everything from money to relationships; manners to fame — is surely a must for every Christmas stocking.

Award-winning actress Sheila Hancock CBE is one of Britain’s most highly regarded actresses. She made her West End stage debut in 1958 and went on to work for Joan Littlewood’s Theatre Workshop and the Royal Shakespeare Company. She has made numerous films and has appeared extensively on television in such popular shows as The Rag Trade, Doctor Who and EastEnders.

A gifted writer, her memoir The Two Of Us is a moving account of her life with the late actor John Thaw.

Her debut novel, Miss Carter’s War, has just been published to acclaim. With its echoes of Miss Jean Brodie one critic described it as ‘a passionately written and compelling portrait of education in post-war Britain’.
