A house fire that eviscerated a home in Newark, New Jersey killed six early Sunday morning. Among those killed were a son visiting to honor his deceased father for Father's Day, as well his mother and four others.

Stephan Sydney, 15, was visiting Newark from Crawford, Georgia, along with his mother Noreen Johnson. The two were there to attend a service for Desmond Sydney Jr., Stephan's father, who had been killed in a bicycle accident two years before.

Cheryl Sydney and Iris Sydney, Stephan's aunt and grandmother, respectively, stood outside of the gutted home Sunday morning. Both were in shock over the tragedy, Cheryl in disbelief that it happened to their loved ones.

'I had to see it for myself,' she told NJ.com. 'This is not something you get told.'

Iris Sydney attended the service at Solid Rock Baptist Church in Newark, and became concerned when her daughter and grandson did not show up. She returned to her home, where a deputy was waiting to break the news.

'I can't believe this,' she said. 'But I'm 
telling you: I buried my husband ... I bury my son, and now this is my 
grandchild. I feel it. I feel it in my heart ... This is a sad day for 
the Sydney family. It is.'

Capt. John Brown, spokesman for the Newark Fire Department, told NJ.com that firefighters were called to the scene at 3:51am. They found the first two floors of the three-story home engulfed in flames.

According to Brown, flames were 'already shooting out of the window.'

'The entire thing was just inflamed' neighbor Taylor Walker told News12 New Jersey.  'I knew that whoever was inside, something bad was going to happen.'

The cause of the fire has not yet been 
determined, but the Essex County Prosecutor's Office say that it doesn't appear to be suspicious.

Authorities investigating the inside of the home. The names of the other four occupants of the home have not been released

Authorities have not yet released the names of the other four victims killed in the fire, but have confirmed that six died.

According to Cheryl Sydney, the family was planning to have a barbecue together on Sunday. The family liked to spend time together, she said.

'This is too much, too much for anybody to take,' she said. 'No family should have to go through this.'

Sydney also called her sister a good, Christian woman, and said that 'For her, nothing was too much.'

Neighbors also spoke highly of the house's occupants.

'They're going to be missed in the community,' neighbor Dwayne Ellis told News12 New Jersey, 'they were real good people. Nobody could say nothing bad about them.'

According to authorities, the fire spread to a home next door. However, all of the occupants in the next door home were evacuated safely.

The fire was also next door to Tree of Life Ministries, a small church. The church was not damaged in the fire.

Rev. James Johnson, who preached at the church, told News12 New Jersey that he consoled the father of one of the unnamed occupants in the home.

'There's a father on Father's Day who lost his son today' he said.

He claimed to have known the occupants very well, and that they were members of his church.
