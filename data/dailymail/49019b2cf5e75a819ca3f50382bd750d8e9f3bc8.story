Charles Manson is trying to become a father.

Matthew Roberts, the son of the notorious criminal, has revealed that one of the reasons his father is set to wed Afton Elaine Burton, who goes by the name Star, is so that the two can have a child.

And while the two are not allowed conjugal visits, Roberts says of his father; 'Somehow he hopes to smuggle his sperm out of the prison.'

He then added; 'He wants to see what it might be like to raise a child with more of his own ideas. He is starting to think about how he wants his legacy to be left once he’s gone.'

Manson was granted a marriage license to marry Star in November of last year

Star, 26, says she has been a fan on Manson, 80, since she was a teenager

Roberts also said in his interview with The Mirror that his father has wanted this for many years.

'Part of the whole thing with him marrying Star is that he would love to have kids and he was waiting for someone to come along and provide that,' he explained.

The 26-year-old has been writing to the killer since she was a teen and even moved from her home in Illinois to the California town where he is imprisoned. 

Previous reports had said the two were already married, but a formal ceremony has yet to be held.

The couple filed for a marriage license on November 7, which gave them just 90 days to carry out the nuptials.

California Department of Corrections spokesman Jeffrey Callison previously stated that the wedding would have to take place on a visiting day, which happen on Saturdays, Sundays and certain holidays (including Thanksgiving).

Callison said the couple would be allowed 10 guests from outside the prison, two guests from inside the prison and an officiant of their own choosing.

However, the two are not be allowed to consummate their marriage since Manson's life in prison sentence bans him from receiving conjugal visits.

In previous interviews, Star gushed about falling in love with Manson and his 'philosophy' as a teen, and how she already considered herself married to him.

Manson has been in prison for the last four decades, after he and four disciples of his doomsday cult carried out a series of murders in 1969.

One of their victims was Roman Polanski's actress wife Sharon Tate, who was butchered to death in her upscale southern California home when she was eight and a half months pregnant.

Manson and his disciples were initially sentenced to death, but later had those sentences commuted to life in prison.

In 2012, he applied and was denied parole, and cannot apply again until 2027 which means the couple have little chance of living together in matrimony.

Manson has been married twice before, first to Rosalie Jean Willis from 1955 to 1958 and then to Candy Stevens from 1959 to 1963.

Star has also been compared to one of Manson's disciples Susan Atkins, known as 'Sexy Sadie', who was also convicted of participating in eight of the August 1969 killings.

Manson and his 'Family' of disciples carried out a series of murders in August 1969, which they thought would bring about a 'Helter Skelter' race war.

The murders were centered on affluent Los Angeles neighborhoods, which they tried to pin on African American.
