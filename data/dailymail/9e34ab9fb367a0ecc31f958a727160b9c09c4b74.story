A massive European satellite is expected to plummet down to earth Monday - and no can predict with accuracy where exactly its debris is going to land.

Europe's Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer, or GOCE, was just 99 miles above Earth and dropping at a rate of 8 miles per day, operations manager Christoph Steiger wrote in a status report posted on the European Space Agency's website.

‘Re-entry into the atmosphere (is) probably less than two days away,’ Steiger said.

The European Space Agency (ESA) claims one of its sleek research satellites, dubbed the 'Ferrari of space' has plummeted somewhere into the South Atlantic ocean

The 1.2-ton, $466million science satellite built by German and Italian engineers was launched in 2009 to map variations in Earth's gravity, and now it is doomed by its force.

Scientists assemble the data into the first detailed global maps of the boundary between the planet's crust and mantle, among other projects.

Full name: Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer

Launched: 17 March 2009

Launcher: Rockot (with Breeze-KM upper stage) by Eurockot Launch Services GmbH

Launch site: Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia

Nominal life: 20 months

Cost: $466million

Orbit: About 161.5 miles altitude, polar, Sun-synchronous

Mass: 2,000lbs

Dimensions: 17.4 feet long, about 3.3 foot body diameter

Propulsion tank: 88.2lbs of xenon gas

Mission: Measuring Earth's gravity field and modelling the geoid with unprecedented accuracy and spatial resolution

The arrowhead-shaped GOCE ran out of xenon fuel on October 21 and has been steadily losing altitude since, tugged by Earth's gravity.

The satellite was intended to orbit at 160 miles, but on Saturday morning it hovering at just 105 miles.

With its aerodynamic design featuring wings and tail fins, GOCE has been called the ‘Ferrari of space.’ 

Most of the spacecraft will burn up as it blasts through the atmosphere, but up 25 per cent of the satellite is expected to survive re-entry and end up somewhere on the planet's surface.

Jeffrey Kluger, senior science and technology editor for Time Magazine, told CBS that earthlings have no cause for panic, but people should be ‘a little bit worried’ about the plunging pile of scorched space debris.

‘Whenever you have one ton of hardware coming down, no one knows where, that's not a good thing,’ he said.

With two-thirds of Earth covered by water and vast areas of sparsely populated land, the risk to human life and property is considered extremely low, the European Space Agency said.

Kluger explained that it is estimated that about 45 pieces of satellite debris, each weighing no more than 200lbs, will breach the atmosphere and land within a footprint of 190 square miles.

‘So a satellite would practically have to be aiming at your house to strike it,’ Kluger wrote in his Friday Time column.

Due to constant changes in Earth's upper atmosphere, scientists cannot yet predict where and when GOCE will re-enter.

Satellites that are too bulky to bring down safely to Earth after they had served their purpose are sometimes boosted into one of the graveyard orbits more than 22,000 miles up, where they can hang around for centuries.

For GOCE, however, it was not a viable option because the satellite only has a small, weak ion engine on board.

The last big satellite to fall back through the atmosphere was Russia's failed Phobos-Grunt Mars probe. The 14-ton spacecraft re-entered in January 2012.

In 2011, NASA's 6.5-ton Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite and Germany's 2.4-ton X-ray ROSAT telescope re-entered.

Heiner Klinkrad, head of the European
 Space Agency's space debris office in Germany, told the site Spaceflight Now that statistically 
speaking, it is 250,000 times more likely to win the jackpot in the 
German lottery than to get hit by a GOCE fragment.

About
 100 tons of space debris falls to Earth every year, and so far there 
have been no reports of injuries of fatalities caused by extra-terrestrial 
scrap metal.

However, under UN’s Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects created in September of 1972, should a space fragment cause damage upon re-entry, the country that launched the satellite would be held accountable, Fox News reported.

The treaty, which has been ratified by 88 countries as of January 2013, guarantees that the state responsible will pay compensation. In the case of GOCE, the satellite was launched from Russia, so that country would be on the hook for any damage.
