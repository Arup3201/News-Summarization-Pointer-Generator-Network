Aston Villa striker Darren Bent: He was forced to speak to officers from the Metropolitan Police after his cousin apparently claimed stolen goods were a gift from the footballer

A police officer cousin of footballer Darren Bent has been arrested on suspicion of stealing from dead victims of crime.

PC Richard Bent, 28, who serves with the Metropolitan Police, was held as detectives investigated a series of high value thefts, including money and jewellery worth thousands of pounds.

Police are also said to be investigating the theft of goods from the officer's central London police station in Westminster.

Fellow officers discovered the expensive items during a raid on his £350,000 flat.

Bent apparently claimed the valuables were a gift from Aston Villa star Darren.

Striker Darren, 28, was said to be furious at the claim and has pledged to co-operate fully with a Scotland Yard anti-corruption probe.

Last week he spoke to officers from the Metropolitan Police's Directorate of Professional standards and is expected to make a full statement.

A source close to the Birmingham-based star claimed in the Sun: 'Darren will happily give the police his co-operation.'

Another source claimed: 'He is fuming at being dragged into this mess.

'Richard said Darren had given him the valuables.'

PC Bent has been suspended by the force while an investigation takes place.

The £35,000-a-year policeman, who lives in Wandsworth, South West London, is the son of Darren's aunt Sandra.

Darren, who started his career with Ipswich Town, has made 13 England appearances, scoring four times for his country.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Officers from the Met’s Directorate of Professional Standards arrested a male police officer on 13 July on suspicion of theft from the MPS.

'He was subsequently arrested in connection with a further count of theft.

'He was taken into custody at a south London police station and subsequently bailed to return on a date in mid-October, pending further investigation.'

The Westminster-based officer was suspended from duty on July 14, the force said.
