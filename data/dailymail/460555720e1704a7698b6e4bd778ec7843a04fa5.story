Kristen Stewart battled through a painful injury to attend the Academy Awards on Sunday night.

The Twilight star, 22, is understood to have cut her foot on glass two days ago but decided the show must go on.

The actress, who was dressed in a stylish Reem Acra gown, walked the red carpet in crutches, occasionally posing unaided for the cameras. 

When Jennifer Lawrence spotted her fellow actress hobbling along with the walking aids, she rushed over to hug Kristen, exclaiming: 'Hey, what happened, Dude?' (Lawrence later had a mishap of her own, falling up the stairs as she went up on stage to accept the best actress gong for Silver Linings Playbook.)

Before she limped on stage to present the award for Achievement in Production Design with Daniel Radcliffe, Stewart caught up with best supporting actress winner Anne Hathaway.

Hathaway asked Stewart if she was going on stage with her crutches.

'Nope. I’m gonna hobble,' Stewart said.

'Well, break a leg,' Hathaway said. 'Oops.'

Stylish: The Twilight star still managed to look elegant while leaning on the two walking aids

Despite the crutches, the actress looked lovely in a white floral velvet fishtail dress.

Kristen arrived at the event solo, amid reports she recently split from her on/off boyfriend of four years Robert Pattinson.

She wore her usual tight jeans and trainers, paired with a T-shirt and a black sweatshirt that advertised a specialty food store in Cincinnati, Ohio.
