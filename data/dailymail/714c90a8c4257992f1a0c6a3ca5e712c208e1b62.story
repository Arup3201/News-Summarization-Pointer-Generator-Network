Students are being encouraged to go to summer school… at GCHQ.

Britain’s spy centre is offering a £2,500 bounty to attract would-be surveillance sleuths to take a ten-week course.

Intelligence chiefs at the listening post are aiming to recruit a new generation of computer wizards to tackle the growing threat of cybercrime.

The 70 or so candidates who successfully apply for the course will be given a glimpse into the latest cyber-technologies as well as learning new skills including cyber-security and hacking.

The top-secret Cheltenham-based spy agency, which provides electronic surveillance of the nation’s enemies, have taken the unprecedented step to help deliver its mission to keep the UK safe.

The Government is increasingly concerned that terrorists and enemy countries could seek to mount a crippling cyber-attack to bring down Britain’s economy, energy supply and national defences at the click of a mouse.

Attackers ranging from lone criminals to rogue states seek to steal industrial secrets or spread mayhem and fear.

A report recently found that four in every five big firms in the UK experienced some sort of serious cyber-security breach last year. US movie giant Sony Pictures was also hacked by North Korea.

But experts say there is a dire shortage of specialists able to defend Britain’ s computer systems from increasingly sophisticated assaults by hostile states and terrorists.

Agents at GCHQ unveiled plans for the summer school, the first of its kind, amid mounting warnings that Britain is one of the world’s major cyber-crime targets, and needs a new type of army to wage war against its digital foes.

The course, which will run from July 6 to September 11, is aimed at computer science students in their first or second year at university who have an interest in cyber beyond that of their studies and are skilled in at least one computer language.

The summer school will feature lessons from GCHQ’s own cybersecurity experts, as well as guest speakers from some of the world’s leading technology companies.

To qualify for a place on the Cyber Insiders Summer School, students will need advanced coding skills, as well as the ability and tenacity to solve a variety of complex problems.

On the course they will work with a wide range of technologies, from legacy systems that have been in use for a number of years to the most up-to-date mobile technology.

They will learn new technical skills in areas such as cyber security, ethical hacking, penetration testing and security networks. They will also learn about GCHQ’s role in defending the UK against cyber threats.

The programme will culminate in a ‘live’ war games-style exercise where they will be able to put the skills that they’ve learned into practice.

Those who successfully complete the course could land a job at the spy agency.

A GCHQ spokesman said: ‘The unique Cyber Insiders Summer School offers computer science students a fantastic opportunity to enhance their cyber skills and to discover how GCHQ use a variety of technologies to protect the UK.

‘They’ll not only enhance their cyber knowledge, but completing the programme will also look good on their CV and, if they prove their abilities, we may even offer them a job interview.’

Prospective candidates should apply through GCHQ’s careers website www.gchq-careers.co.uk. Places are limited and applications close next Monday (Mar09).
