A former BBC executive denied being a 'serial age discrimination offender' as she defended the sacking of racing pundit John McCririck.

Jay Hunt, now an executive at Channel 4, against whom McCririck has launched a £3million age discrimination claim, said she had 'learnt lessons' from the Miriam O'Reilly case, in which the 51-year-old was axed from BBC's Countryfile because of ageism.

Today Hunt told Central London Employment Tribunal that no-one in Channel 4's racing team had acted 'on the grounds of age' when deciding to let McCririck go after 29 years on the programme.

In a statement she said: 'John McCririck's allegation that I am a 'serial age discrimination offender' is untrue.'

She went on to say that younger presenters were not better presenters, but admitted that while she could have vetoed the decision to axe McCririck, she decided not to.

Cambridge-educated Hunt also said that while she was involved in the decision to replace Strictly Come Dancing judge Arlene Phillips, 70, with Alesha Dixon, 34, it was nothing to do with ageism.

She told the tribunal: 'There were concerns about whether Strictly Come Dancing was in danger of becoming less appealing to viewers...

'In the previous series, there had been concerns about the judges talking over each other and the conversation generally becoming very exclusive'.

Hunt said she had instigated an anti-discrimination training programme for staff after she joined Channel 4 in 2011 but she admitted that it was voluntary and that Jamie Aitchison, the sports commissioning editor who had been instrumental in sacking McCririck, hadn't take part.

The tribunal also heard from Carl Hicks, the IMG production company's executive producer of Channel 4 Racing, who suggested that McCririck should be dropped from the channel's revamped racing line-up.

Hicks, who was brought in to head Channel 4's revamped racing coverage, repeatedly called for the veteran presenter to be dropped, saying that his 'pantomime' presenting was a distraction.

He told the tribunal: 'He was not appropriate and there was not an appropriate role for him.'

He added: 'I'm very sympathetic to his position but never felt he would be part of the newly enhanced production team from 2013.

'It is not him waving his arms around for tic-tac, that was a distraction.

'John was an eccentric and seen at worst as a loud-mouthed and chauvinistic extraordinaire which was not what I wanted to be part of the team to broaden racing.'

IMG executive Carl Hicks told the tribunal that McCririck called presenter Clare Balding 'ravishing' on-screen

He also said he felt McCririck's reality show appearances 'compromised his integrity as a sports broadcaster' but said there was no room for him in his new line-up that he believed would be 'the poshest team in racing'.

Hicks' new team includes Clare Balding, who had childhood links to the Queen, and Nick Luck, who went to Harrow.

He told the tribunal that McCririck had a habit of referring to his colleague Tanya Stephenson as 'the female, which was disparaging to her', said he called Balding 'ravishing' on-screen, and said he felt strongly that he should not be included in the new team.

Arlene Phillips, 70, was replaced on the Strictly panel by Alesha Dixon, 34, but Jay Hunt said it wasn't ageism

Hicks said: 'I did not think his exaggerated presentation style was consistent with a more serious programme and was aware that he had a potential to offend and alienate viewers and potential viewers.'

The tribunal also heard that McCririck had 'a tendency to misname jockeys and horses', although Hicks denied it was a factor for dropping him from the team.

McCririck is accusing his former employers of age discrimination but Channel 4 and IMG deny the claims.

The 73-year-old pundit, known for his flamboyant clothes, facial hair and gold jewellery, believes he was 'sacked by anonymous suits and skirts' because of his age.

The hearing continues.
