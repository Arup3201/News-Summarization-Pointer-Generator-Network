It’s not unusual for some people to dress up their dogs in attention-grabbing coats and even miniature tutus.

But any prized pup that wears an authentic spacesuit is very likely to be the best dressed canine at any dog show.

Dog lovers will get the chance to buy just the outfit, because a genuine 1950s spacesuit will be up for auction in Berlin on September 13 - but they'll need to be a dedicated follow of doggy fashion, as it is expected to fetch around €8,000 (£6,317).

Space walkies! A genuine 1950s spacesuit will be up for auction in Berlin on September 13 and is expected to fetch around €8,000 (£6,317). It is modelled here by a modern dog

The lace-up suit comes with an oxygen supply tube is made from a combination of cotton, nylon, aluminium and rubber.

It could have been worn by space dogs Belka and Strelka during training sessions for the USSR’s Korabl-Sputnik 2 mission.

The auction catalogue reads: ‘The dog space suit can be adjusted to the size of the dog at body and legs with strings. There is a ring in the front for the helmet’s insertion.

Paws for thought: The suit is believed to have been have been worn by space dogs Belka (pictured left) and Strelka (right)  during training sessions for the USSR’s Korabl-Sputnik 2 mission

‘The tube for the oxygen supply runs along the lower side of the suit. The suit was made by RSC Energia, the largest Russian manufacturer of spacecraft and space station components.’ 

The suits has been marked 'T-1, 1 and I/X-61,' leading experts to assume that it has been used. Only a small number of the dog suits have survived and this one is said to be in ‘good condition’. 

It is approximately 28cm by 10cm by 21 cm.

The US used chimpanzees to study the effects of gravity, while Russia selected dogs because they can be easily trained to sit for long spells of time.

The dogs played a key role in paving the way for human cosmonauts and high pressure suits were developed for the canines in the 1950s to test the effects of high speed launches on them.

Some tests involved dogs being strapped inside small capsules that were launched to heights of 50miles (80km) before returning to Earth by parachute.

Laika the dog famously became the first animal to orbit Earth in 1957, but sadly died from stress and overheating during the mission.

However, Belka, meaning squirrel, and Strelka, meaning arrow,  returned to Earth safety in 1960 after spending a day in space.

They were accompanied by a grey rabbit, 42 mice, two rats, flies and a selection of plants and fungis, all of which survived.

Strelka went on to have six puppies with a dog named Pushok, who was involved in experiments on the ground. 

And one of their puppies, named Pushinka, meaning fluffy, was given to President John F Kennedy’s daughter, Caroline, by Nikita Khrushchev.

Demonstrating a thawing in the Cold War, Pushinka had pups of her own with a Kennedy dog called Charlie.

Korabl-Sputnik 2, also known as Vostok-1K No.2, was a Soviet satellite and the third test flight of the Vostok spacecraft.

It was the first mission to send animals into orbit - where they returned safely back to Earth.

Dogs Belka and Strelka blasted off on August 19 1960 along with a grey rabbit, 42 mice, two rats, some flies and a variety of plants - and a TV camera on board.

All the animals returned to Earth on August 20, the day after the launch. It is thought that one of the dogs suffered seizures during the fourth orbit.

In July the launch vehicle of another Vostock vehicle disintegrated and dogs were killed in the capsule upon impact with the ground.

The Korabl-Sputnik 2 mission paved the way for the first human orbital flight - Vostock 1 - which launched less than eight months later.
