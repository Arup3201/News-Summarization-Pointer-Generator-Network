It's rare to find a designer who sticks to her style guns through thick and thin but Emilia Wickstead isn't your average fashion creative.

True to form, this was a collection carefully calibrated to appeal to the ladylike, the kitten of heeled and the violently allergic to London's wackier names.

No wonder, then, that Wickstead counts the ever-elegant Samantha Cameron among her faithful fans and although the Prime Minister's wife didn't put in an appearance, she's very likely to put in an order or two.

Ladylike: Buttercup yellow and pretty powder pink were combined to elegant effect at Emilia Wickstead

There was nothing here that could be considered wacky, outré or in bad taste: instead, what we got was a masterclass in stylish summer dressing.

Granted, there was nothing particularly new about the silhouette, which with its neat bell skirt and nipped in waist said 1950s rather than now, although it was undeniably pretty.

But newness isn't what Wickstead is really about: instead, she wants to make clothes that women really want to wear, whether they're Samantha Cameron or a mother-of-two from deepest Derbyshire.

And wearable, Wickstead's thoroughly feminine collection was. Delicate flowing dresses lifted with stripes and bearing forgiving Empire waistlines.

Bold hues: Wickstead plumped for vibrant shades of cornflower blue and buttercup yellow

Vintage: Wickstead stayed true to her flatteringly feminine style

Breezy: Boldly coloured striped gave the collection an airy feel

Elegant: A shirt dress that's bound to find favour at No. 10

Neat skirt suits with bell-shaped skirts and beautifully tailored jackets.  A vibrant orange and pink striped dress with a 50's A-line skirt. And an utterly gorgeous lightweight tailored coat.

Like the fabrics, colours were sumptuous with buttercup yellow, delicate blush pink, shimmering cornflower blue and vibrant crimson among the most eye-catching.

There was the odd touch of print, a charmingly quirky piano motif, but nothing to scare the horses - it was playful Britishness at its best.

All shimmered together beautifully, never breaking stride or indeed a sweat. No falls, no drama, no silliness.

All was well in the world of Emilia Wickstead.
