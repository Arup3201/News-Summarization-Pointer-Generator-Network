Gary Hunt has done the UK proud after he was crowned the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series champion for 2014.

The 30-year-old thrillseeker won the final event of the tournament, his fourth triumph of the season, at Kil Cenote on Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula to take the title.

With exactly 500 points, he beats the 2013 World Series winner Artem Silchenko, in second, and the USA’s David Colturi, in third place.

And in this video, Hunt's successes are highlighted by his fellow competitors, and we get a closer look at some of the intricacies of his dangerous diving. 

'Gary is just unreal to watch him dive,' says one of his colleagues, while another adds: 'His skills are something incredible.'

'Gary Hunt, you are the man,'  

Orlando Duque, 10-time world champion pays the ultimate compliment when he says: 'People like that in sports, not only in our sport, come very few times, and I'm happy that we have him in our sport and that he's pushing it to the point he has.'

Speaking after his victory, the Southampton-born diver said: 'The plan worked perfectly. I really wanted to win here after twice winning the World Series and not being on top of the podium at the final event. 

'I wanted it so much and on the platform I really felt the nerves, and so I’m over the moon that I got it. 

'Losing the title last year was a big motivation for me. I wouldn’t be the diver that I am today if I had not suffered that disappointment.' 

There was delight for the UK diver after Hunt reversed last year's final placings with Russia's Artem Silchenko to walk away with the 2014 prize

After Friday's women's finals, on Saturday it was the turn of the men as 14 cliff divers dove into the crystal-clear waters of the sinkhole in the Mexican jungle during a total of four rounds of competition. 

Divers jump from a platform at a height ranging from 26-28 m (85-92ft). 

Hunt's superb execution of his famed triple quad dive, with a degree of difficulty of 6.2, in the final saw the judges produce 9s and the Englishman secure a grand total of 500.00 points. 

With two 10s from the judges for the intimidating flying inward dive, Russia’s Artem Silchenko (451.60pts) set the course for another podium finish after his victory at the previous World Series stop in Spain. David Colturi (451.30pts) performed strongly in the second part of the season to finish the year with a third place.

The Southampton-born diver certainly has the respect of his rivals after yet more success

The top-three finish saw Colturi climb from seventh to fifth (610pts) in the final standings and with it guarantee automatic qualification for 2015. 

Four wins out of seven make Hunt (1,110pts) a very worthy four-time champion. The 2013 winner, Russia's Artem Silchenko, finished runner-up not only in Mexico but also the overall standings (860pts).

Completing the top five for 2014 are the winner from Portugal, Steven LoBue (USA, 680pts), in third place and 10-time world champion Orlando Duque on fourth (660pts). 

The fight for one of the coveted top-five places was tight until the very last of 350 competition dives in 2014, and a thrilling qualification competition is in prospect for the remaining five spots in the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series 2015.
