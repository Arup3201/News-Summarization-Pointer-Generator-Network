Hillary Clinton is taking time out of her busy international schedule during her last few months as Secretary of State to make her presence known, on the dance floor that is.

Mrs Clinton's latest dance outburst occurred on Tuesday during a dinner in Pretoria, South Africa.

The former first lady has been showing her lighter side in recent months, and first unveiled her smooth moves during a trip to a Colombian nightclub during an international summit in Cartagena this April.

Enthusiastic: The former first lady has been showing off her lighter side in recent months as she prepares to end her term, having said that she will not continue on if President Obama is re-elected

Considering that trip was marred by the unravelling of the Secret Service prostitution scandal, Mrs Clinton's night out was seen as a fun way for the ever-busy diplomat to relax with her staff.

Unlike the Latin grooves of her April dance floor appearance, Mrs Clinton was swayed by the sounds of South African jazz singer Judith Sephuma at Tuesday night's dinner.

Video shows that Mrs Clinton was the first one to get on the dance floor at the event, and it quickly filled after her lead.

After beginning with some non-threatening shoulder-shuffling and hip shaking, the singer eventually singled the Secretary out and the two began to jokingly wiggling next to one another.

Empowered: Earlier in the day, Clinton appeared with Nkoana-Mashabane (right) and said that American efforts in South Africa have helped save hundreds of thousands of lives

Even though the singer was a bit more wild on the fashion front with an animal print dress, Mrs Clinton didn't shy away from the spotlight with her wardrobe selection either, opting for an electric blue evening jacket and her hair pulled back in a tight ponytail.

With her wide smile and continued presence at the center of the action, it was clear that Mrs Clinton had fun at the event.

Not to be deceived by the implication that the trip was largely social, she kept a tight schedule throughout the day.

Not a dance move: Even when they were off the dance floor during their meetings earlier on Tuesday, Nkoana-Mashabane and Clinton appeared to be in sync

Her trip to South Africa- the country 
with the highest rate of HIV infection- came nearly two weeks after she 
spoke at the International AIDS Conference in Washington, D.C.

She met with foreign minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane and the pair hosted a joint press conference where Mrs Clinton said that through the various American-sponsored relief programs, they have been able to save 'hundreds of thousands of lives' in the country.

They also attended a business summit where economic incentives were analysed for possible ways to expand growth in the region.

In keeping with the friendly nature of the visit, Mrs Clinton paid a visit to former South African president Nelson Mandela.

Old friends: On Monday, Clinton met with former South African President Nelson Mandela. The two have known eachother since the 1990s when Bill Clinton and Mandela were presidents at the same time

Though the 94-year-old leader is in ailing health and has seen only a handful of visitors outside of direct relatives in recent years, he appeared happy throughout the visit on Monday. Mrs Clinton commented on his 'beautiful smile'.

Mr Mandela and the Clintons have a long-standing relationship, as he was president at the same time as Mrs Clinton's husband, former President Bill.

In spite of her surge in popularity across both sides of the political aisle in recent months, Mrs Clinton has repeatedly declared that she will be resigning and not serving as Secretary if President Obama is re-elected for a second term.

Though many have speculated that she is lining up for a second presidential run in 2016, she has denied as much publicly and said that the busy schedule has left her in need of a break.
