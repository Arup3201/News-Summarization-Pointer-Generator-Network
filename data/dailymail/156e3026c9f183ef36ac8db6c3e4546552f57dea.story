Celtic's Derk Boerrigter has accepted a two-match ban after an SFA investigation into his apparent dive during the 3-0 win over St Johnstone last week.

The Dutchman tumbled theatrically to win a penalty after a challenge from Saints captain Dave Mackay, who was red-carded in the incident.

The Perth side were left fuming after the decision by match referee John Beaton and even Celtic manager Ronny Deila admitted he would speak to his player should he feel he was guilty of simulation.

Unfair dismissal: Celtic's Derk Boerrigter has been punished for his alleged dive against St Johnstone

Reprieve: St Johnstone captain Dave Mackay could now have his red card rescinded by the SFA

The SFA probe into the incident concluded at the end of last week with their compliance officer offering a two-match ban — or the chance to fight that decision at a fast-track appeal on Thursday.

Celtic announced on Monday that they would not contest the ban and Boerrigter will now miss league games against Inverness Caley Thistle and Dundee.

The development is a boost for Mackay, whose appeal against his red card will be heard on Thursday.

Mackay said: ‘I’ve got to wait to hear officially but surely my red card will be rescinded now.

‘I’ve not heard a thing yet but I think it was the right decision to cite Boerrigter. It doesn’t help us though. The game is done.

‘Taking action after games has happened before. I remember Sone Aluko getting done when he was up here. So people know this can happen.

‘We had a meeting with the referees just before the start of the season and we were told they would be looking at people they think might have dived.

‘If they weren’t punished at the time, they warned they would go back and take a look at it and give them a two-game ban where it was a dive.

‘So they have stuck to their word with the Boerrigter one.

‘I assume my appeal will be upheld now. I’d be astonished at any other outcome.’
