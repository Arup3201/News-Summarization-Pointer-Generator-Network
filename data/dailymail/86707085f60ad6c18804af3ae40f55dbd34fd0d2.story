Former Ipswich striker Pablo Counago has dismissed Roy Keane as 'a mess' and 'a coward' after coming under attack from his former manager in his new autobiography, The Second Half.

Keane branded the Spaniard 'dead lazy' and admitted he was 'a player I didn't particularly like or get on with' and added 'I nearly physically attacked him'.

But Counago, who played under Keane between 2009 and 2011 at Portman Road, said in a statement to independent Ipswich Town website TWTD: 'The love and respect I feel for ITFC and its fans is something he will never feel. 

'I could say lots of awful things about him but I don't feel right speaking about him, I feel sorry for him. That's why whatever he says about me I don't take offence, even though he's not telling the truth about me.

Keane launches his autobiography, The Second Half, at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin on Thursday

'It seems like he needs to criticise players, managers and directors etc to keep selling books as he is not able to do anything else in football. It is a very sad ending for a person that was so big as a player.

'As I told him once, I think he is a complete mess as a football manager. As he has said in his book, he wanted to hit me, but behind his appearance there's a coward.

'I just hope he can find happiness in his life as, in my opinion, being that miserable must be very mentally draining.'
