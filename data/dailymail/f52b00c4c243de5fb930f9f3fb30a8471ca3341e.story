The mother of a Guatemalan boy whose body was found in the desert about a mile from Texas’ southern border said Tuesday she begged him not to make the dangerous journey from the Cuchumatanes mountains – but he didn’t listen.

Cipriana Juarez Diaz, who suffers from epilepsy and is bedridden, said her son Gilberto told her he wanted to earn money to help her.

‘I told him not to go but he wanted to help me get rid of my illness,’ said Juarez Diaz.

Heartbroken: Cipriana Juarez Diaz recalled how she told her son Gilberto Francisco not to leave their home, but he insisted on making the trek to the U.S. border

Confusion: Even though Gilberto Francisco was 15 years old, his birth certificate states he was 11 because he was erroneously listed as a twin of his 11-year-old brother, Gilberto Haroldo (pictured)

Before Gilberto set out from his family’s humble cinder-block and sheet-metal home, his mother draped him with a white rosary.

‘He was a good son,’ she said. ‘I just hope God gives me the strength to bear seeing his body when they bring him to me.’

Gilberto Francisco Ramos Juarez was found with the rosary still around his neck and a brother’s Chicago phone number scribbled on the inside of his belt buckle about two weeks ago. 

He was alone in brush less than a mile from the nearest U.S. home, a South Texas sheriff said Monday. He apparently got lost on his way north and likely died from the elements. An autopsy did not find signs of trauma.

His birth certificate says he was 11 years old. But his father, Francisco Ramos Diaz, said Tuesday that the boy was really 15.

Ramos Diaz said Gilberto’s birth certificate carried the birth date of his younger brother because it took the family several years to register him.

Because the parents couldn’t remember the exact date of Gilberto’s birth, they gave the same date for both young sons, who became listed as twins.

Gilberto set out from chilly, rugged terrain, the peaks and canyons of an area only accessible by dirt road. Associated Press reporters hiked a rocky, muddy path for 45 minutes to reach the village.

The boy’s family said they had last heard from him about 25 days before his body was found. At that time, he was in Reynosa, Mexico, waiting to cross the border. His father told authorities the boy was traveling with a migrant smuggler.

Investigators were able to reach the boy’s brother in Chicago; his phone number was one of three on the boy’s belt. It’s not uncommon for immigrants to put relatives’ phone numbers on their clothing because scraps of paper can get lost or wet during their journey.

The boy’s brother gave authorities his father’s phone number in Guatemala, and the dad identified the boy’s personal items.

The cause of death has not been determined, but authorities suspect heat stroke, Guerra said. The boy was no longer wearing a shirt when he was found.

Gilberto, wearing Angry Birds jeans, black leather boots and a white rosary around his neck, had apparently gotten lost on his way north from his native country and was found June 15, alone in the brush less than a mile from the nearest U.S. home, a South Texas sheriff said Monday.

While hundreds of immigrants die crossing the border each year, the discovery of the teenager's decomposed remains highlights the perils unaccompanied children face as the U.S. government searches for ways to deal with record numbers of children crossing into the country illegally.

'Down here finding a decomposed body ... we come across them quite often,' Hidalgo County Sheriff Eddie Guerra said, adding that this was the first child immigrant his office has found since he became sheriff in April. 'It's a very dangerous journey.'

More than 52,000 unaccompanied children have been apprehended entering the U.S. illegally since October, creating what President Barack Obama has called an 'urgent humanitarian situation.'

On Monday, Obama asked Congress for more money and additional authority to deal with the surge of youths, mostly from Central America. Obama wants flexibility to speed the youths' deportations and $2billion in new money to hire more immigration judges and open more detention facilities.

The number of unaccompanied immigrant children arrested along the border has been rising for three years as they fled pervasive gang violence in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. More recently, children and parents have said they heard children traveling alone and parents traveling with young kids would be released by authorities and allowed to continue to their destination.

Common: Sheriff Eddie Guerra says finding decomposing bodies of immigrants in the desert is not uncommon

Many of the
 children turn themselves in to the first law enforcement person they 
see, so Guerra said it was unusual to find a child in this more remote 
area — near La Joya, about 20 miles west of McAllen.

About
 445 immigrants died along the U.S.-Mexico border last year, according 
to the Border Patrol. The Pima County medical examiner in Arizona, which
 is the perennial leader in immigrant deaths, recorded 168 of the 
deaths; of the 70 where an age was confirmed, none were younger than 13.
