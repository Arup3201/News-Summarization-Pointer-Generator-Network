Internet service providers will be able to offer websites preferential treatment in exchange for money if new plans to restructure the rules governing net neutrality are enforced, it has been claimed.

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission is set to propose new rules that would allow companies to pay a premium for faster internet services to make them more attractive to consumers.

The move would be seen as controversial as net neutrality rules are considered vital for users to freely select the websites they want to visit without companies steering them towards those which have paid extra money for business, political or other reasons.

Premium: One potential issue could occur if bandwidth-heavy websites such as Netflix and Skype (pictured) are forced to pay extra to guarantee a smoother delivery - the cost of which could be transferred to consumers

The FCC's plans would grant internet service providers the power to decide which websites will be able to run at full efficiency and, perhaps more importantly, which will be restricted, according to the Wall Street Journal, which claims to have seen an early draft of the new regulations.

One concern is that this power could easily be abused, with certain websites being given the fastest services while their competitors face limits and restrictions, making them less attractive to consumers.

This theoretical abuse of power could, of course, be used for political as well as economic reasons.

Another potential issue could occur if bandwidth-heavy websites such as Netflix and Skype are forced to pay extra to guarantee a smoother delivery - the cost of which could be transferred to consumers.

The FCC's chairman Tom Wheeler is scheduled to present proposals for a change to net neutrality rules to members of the commission later today.

The new rules are meant to replace the FCC's open internet order from 2010, which was struck down by a federal appeals court in January.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit affirmed that the FCC had the authority to create open-access rules but said it failed to establish that its 2010 regulations didn't overreach.

While the older rules technically allowed for paid priority treatment, it was discouraged.

The new rules are expected to spell out standards that such deals would have to meet to be considered 'commercially reasonable' and will be designed to survive a court challenge in the future.

Under the proposed rules, if such a deal for priority access were challenged, the commission would look at its impact on competition, on consumers, on free speech and civic engagement, and whether a broadband provider was acting in good faith.

The commission will also ask for comment on how to make such dealings more transparent, but didn't have a recommendation on the matter.Â 

The proposed changes would also restore a previous rule that prohibits internet service providers blocking access to websites, which could help start ups foster the growth of the internet economy.

Part of changes would require the FCC to establish a minimum standard of service - soemthing it says it will ask the public to help with.

Although the FCC says it is not currently seeking to treat internet providers as 'common carriers' such as telephone companies - which would subject companies like Comcast and Verizon to even stricter rules - it is keeping the option on the table.

The draft rules kick off a policymaking process that involves commissioner votes and a public comment period before a final vote sometime this summer.
