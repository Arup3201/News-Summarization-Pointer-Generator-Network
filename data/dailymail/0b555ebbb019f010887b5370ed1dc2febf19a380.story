Like many professional athletes, Tiger Woods has decided to move into the hospitality industry with a huge new restaurant set to be opened this year.

But it appears to have already hit a speed bump, with project developer Nicholas Mastroianni revealing it cannot be named 'Tiger Woods' because Nike owns the rights to the golfer's full name.

He made the claims when asked in an interview about the Florida project's clunky name - The Woods Jupiter: Sports and Dining Club.

Tiger Woods is unable to name his restaurant after himself because Nike owns the rights to his name, the project developer has claimed

In an interview with Golf.com, he said he was told that 'Nike has the rights to the name Tiger Woods', adding that even gaining permission to use Woods' name in a press release was 'over the top'. 

However, Woods' manager Mark Steinberg has contradicted the claims, saying Nike does not own the rights to his client's name.

He said: 'I can't imagine how this could have been communicated this way. It is wholly inaccurate and categorically false', golfchannel.com reported. 'Tiger owns his own name and always had.'

A Nike spokesperson supported this, denying the corporation owned the rights to the name Tiger Woods.

Developer Allied Capital and Development of South Florida previously said the property is expected to be a 5,900-square-foot restaurant, likely to open in early 2015.

Woods said he envisions 'a place where people can meet friends, watch sports on TV and enjoy a great meal.

'I wanted to build it locally where I live and where it could help support the community.'

The restaurant will be located in a new shopping center development called Harbourside, which is set to open in full in October.

The $150million development will feature an amphitheater, marina, restaurants and shops and Woods says he's had his eyes on the property for two years.

Mr Mastroianni said: 'I couldn’t be more excited to have Tiger’s new establishment operating within Harbourside Place,' the Palm Beach Post reported.

'It’s gratifying to see the final stages met with support from local, national and international organizations such as Mr Woods.'
