You may soon be able to use your iPad in direct sunlight if Apple goes ahead with rumoured plans for an anti-glare screen.

Reports claim Apple suppliers have begun manufacturing the new range of iPads ahead of an October launch.

And sources believe the devices will have anti-reflective laminated displays to make it easier to use in bright light, and outside - compared to current, reflective models. 

Reports claim Apple's suppliers have begun manufacturing the new range of iPads, and they may feature anti-glare displays. This would make the devices easier to use outside. The refreshed tablet range is expected to launch in October. Last year's iPad Air (left) and iPad mini with Retina display (right) are pictured

By comparison, the Kindle Fire HD tablet already has a polarising filter and uses anti-glare technology.  

According to Bloomberg, two unnamed people familiar with plans said mass production of the 9.7-inch iPad Air 2 has started, and a refreshed 7.9-inch iPad mini will be manufactured soon.

Apple is hoping to boost iPad sales with its new range, after they slumped 9 per cent in the last quarter.

The iPhone maker reported sales of $37.4 billion (£21.9 billion) in its third quarter ending June, falling short of expectations for about $38 billion (£22.3 billion).

The Cupertino-based company also revealed that only 13.2 million iPads were sold in the last quarter, compared to 16.3 million in the previous quarter.

The results have triggered fears that iPad sales are set to get worse once Apple launches its rumoured, large-screen iPhone this autumn. 

Last year, Apple launched its iPhone 5S and 5C at a September event, followed by new iPads in October.

If the firm follows suit this year - and Apple launches its iPhone 6 at a rumoured event on 9 September - it’s likely the iPads will be released on 21 October.

At the start of August, leaked images of what is purported to be the casing for the next-generation iPad Air appeared online.

It is not known whether the images are of a real iPad or whether they are just a designer's musing on what Apple's next offering will be.

Two images show what the casing may look like from a distance, while a close-up image reveals the case’s depth.

In the image that shows the exterior of the rear case, the camera lens is pictured in the top left-hand corner with a small hole next to it.

This hole, purported to be for the rear microphone, is similar to those seen on the rear of the iPhone 5S and 5C.

By comparison, the current microphone on the iPad Air is positioned in the centre, at the top of the rear case.

On the leaked image of the case's interior, two holes along the top right-hand side of the case are believed to be where the volume controls will sit.

The controls on the current iPad Air are raised, but these holes suggest the next-generation controls will be built flush with the case.

Aside from these minor tweaks, the size and thickness of the case appears to be the same.
