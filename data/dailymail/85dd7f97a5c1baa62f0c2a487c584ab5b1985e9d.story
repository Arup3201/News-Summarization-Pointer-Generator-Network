A mother has condemned her son's school's 'over the top' rules on hairstyles after her 12-year-old was put in isolation because he had a wrestling logo shaved into his head.

Aidan Fradley was barred from conventional lessons after he had the letters 'TNA' shaved into his hair ahead of a trip to London to watch Total Nonstop Action Wrestling at Wembley Arena.

His mother Sophie Turkentine, 33, had initially vowed to keep Aidan out of Ramsey Academy, in Halstead, Essex, until after half term.

However, she has since reluctantly had the sides of her son's head shaved, and he has now returned to class.

'He went into school on Monday to literally get put straight into isolation,' she said.

'I’m absolutely fuming, which is why I went to pick him up. I don’t see how it affects anything he’s doing in school.

'It’s not like it’s outrageously blue or pink. It’s just three letters. I think it’s nice to be original.'

The mother-of-five also claimed there was no consistency and she regularly sees girls with short skirts, wearing lots of jewellery and make-up.

She added: 'I knew the school would have something to say, but I didn’t think they’d be anything like they have. I think it’s really over the top.'

Deputy headteacher Calum Leys said: 'At the Ramsey Academy it is our aim for students to develop a sense of pride in their work, behaviour and dress. As part of this we consider uniform to be important and students are expected to be correctly dressed at all times

'We are incredibly proud of our achievements in this regard over the last 18 months and we regularly receive praise from the community in relation to the improved conduct and appearance of our students.

'While we do not believe it is appropriate to comment upon individual students, the academy does have clear expectations regarding dress. One of these is extreme hairstyles, which will not be permitted.

'Our approach in this situation are, we believe, consistent with other secondary schools.'

Expectations: Calum Leys, deputy head at Ramsey Academy, said students were expected to be 'correctly dressed at all times'
