Uber Technologies Inc., the popular car service app, is close to raising between $35 billion and $40 billion in their latest round of funding.

Anonymous Insiders have told Bloomberg that T.Rowe Price Group may become a new investor in the already thriving company.

Fidelity Investments, who is an existing contributor, will also be involved in the funding.

Raising funds: Uber lead by CEO Travis Kalancik may raise up to $40 billion in their latest round of fundraising 

Inside sources who wished not be named told Bloomberg that despite the rumors, financing isn't closed and the investors may change.

T.Rowe once considered investing in Uber and may still pass again this time, said the sources.

Back in June, Uber managed to raise $18 billion and if they complete this round of funding they should more than double that amount with $35 billion to $40 billion.

This report comes after a bad couple of weeks for Uber when the company's leaders were criticized for suggesting they could dig up dirt on journalists  who oppose their company and chastised for having a shady privacy policy.

Despite the controversial press, Business Insider reports that an internal investigation from 2013 shows that the company is on its way to making $1.5 billion to $2 billion in revenue this year.

Fortune reports that in addition to Fidelty Uber's current shareholders are  Benchmark, First Round Capital, Lowercase Capital, Menlo Ventures, Google Ventures, TPG Capital, Summit Partners, Wellington Management, BlackRock and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.
