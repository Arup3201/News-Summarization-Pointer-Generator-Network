The war of words over Delon Armitage’s three-month ban continued as disciplinary chiefs branded the former England international ‘an habitual offender’ with ‘an appalling disciplinary record’.

Armitage was found guilty of conducting himself in an unsportsmanlike manner at Welford Road earlier this month, with details of the Toulon full back’s post-match bust-up with Leicester supporters revealed by Sportsmail.

His lengthy suspension prompted a furious backlash from comic-book tycoon Mourad Boudjellal, who owns the Top 14 club and threatened to sue those who testified against the 31-year-old.

The independent disciplinary panel released their full judgment on Sunday and revealed that Armitage, who pleaded not guilty, admitted to twice telling Leicester supporters to ‘f*** off’ after the 25-21 defeat in the East Midlands.

‘We considered the player’s previous record and concluded that he is an habitual offender against the laws of the game, and one for whom there needs to be a deterrent to combat a clear pattern of offending, both on and off the field,’ read the judgment.

‘The player is without doubt an exceptionally talented individual, but he has an appalling disciplinary record, both on and off the field.’ 

In his time at London Irish the fullback was banned for five weeks for a dangerous tackle on Bath's Tom Biggs

Armitage’s comments were made in earshot of children and his previous history counted against him when the three-man committee made their judgment.

His latest rap is likely to be challenged by Toulon. The player was found not guilty of calling supporters ‘inbred *****’ at half-time but was found guilty for an altercation witnessed by Leicester fan Stephen Hampson, whose 11-year-old son approached Armitage for an autograph. 

‘The player signed Master Hampson’s programme, though he declined to be photographed with him,’ said the judgment. ‘As the player left the pitch-level walkway and started to go up the steps, there was an interaction with a group of Tigers fans.

‘The player admitted in his evidence that he had sworn at them and had used the words “f*** off” twice and raised his hand/arm in a dismissive wave away, which he had not intended to be threatening.

‘Mr Hampson told the committee that the player seemed very agitated and was shouting in an intimidating and threatening manner and used the words “f*** off, I’ll f****** come down there and sort you out. F*** off — come on then, come on then f*** off”.’

In his defence, Armitage said that he had been the subject of ‘banter and abuse’. His previous disciplinary record meant the ban was extended from eight to 12 weeks.

The judgment read: ‘We were not impressed by the player when he gave evidence and was questioned.’
