When Jakki Ballan started putting on weight as a teenager, her well-meaning GP suggested that she swap her favourite full-fat Coke for the lower-calorie diet version.

She duly slimmed down, but soon developed an astonishing obsession with the fizzy drink which has seen her spend as much as £150,000 over the last three decades.

At one stage the single mother of five would finish up to 50 cans a day – more than three per waking hour.

Jakki Ballan says she is addicted to Diet Coke and drinks about 10 litres a day. 
This is the amount she drinks every week

She was consuming more than 28 pints of Diet Coke every day, the equivalent of double her own body weight a week.

Miss
 Ballan, who quit her job at a dry cleaners 16 years ago to go on maternity leave, found her habit was also financially draining – costing her 
around £500 a month at her worst.

And while she has tried to tackle her addiction she still gets through the equivalent of 30 cans a day.

At one point, her 30-year dependence became so severe she was spending £500 a month on the drink

Yesterday
 at her home in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, the 42-year-old pleaded for 
help, saying: ‘This addiction is taking over my life. I won’t do the 
school run unless I have at least two bottles in my bag.

‘I’ve only got one bottle in the house so I’m feeling quite panicky. I’m sweating, shaking and pacing up and down.

‘I’ve reached a point where this has got to stop.’

Ms Ballan is now seeking medical treatment, including hypnotherapy, to conquer overcome her addiction after suffering hallucinations as a result of consuming so much

Miss
 Ballan said she suffers constant headaches and recently began 
experiencing hallucinations which she blames on the drink.

‘I see 
strange things like oranges flying across the room,’ she said. ‘I dread 
to think what my insides look like.’

Miss
 Ballan recently visited her GP, but he told her there was nothing he 
could do.

But Dr Sarah Schenker, a dietitian for the British Dietetic 
Association, urged her to try cognitive behavioural therapy – as she 
said the phosphoric acid contained in the drink would eventually damage 
her bones.

She added: 
‘This woman is suffering cravings that are influencing her life. Diet 
Coke is part of her routine and the reward system in her brain may be 
responding to it.’

She also suffers from constant headaches and has recently started to experience hallucinations, which she puts down to her dependence on Diet Coke

Ms Ballan says she panics if she doesn't have access to a constant supply of the fizzy drink

'Drinking Diet Coke has become part of her routine and the reward system in her brain may be responding to it.

'Fizzy drinks contain phosphorous, which is not harmful in small doses. But if it's consumed in very large doses it can be bad for bone health. It's this lasting damage that is worrying.

"But my biggest concern is that if this woman is filling herself up on Diet Coke she will not be eating a balanced diet and giving her body the nutrients it needs.

'There are things she can do to break the habit. In this case, her perception is everything, so I would suggest Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. 

'This is often used for people with eating disorders, and could help her change her behaviour and learn to cope without Diet Coke.'

Ms Ballan has now vowed to seek help from a hypnotherapist to help change her behaviour and wants to warn others about the dangers of fizzy drinks.

She said: 'To anyone who drinks quite a lot of fizzy drinks already, I'd urge them to be very aware of the potential extreme impact it can have on your life, like it has on mine.'

Low-calorie fizzy drinks like Diet Coke can aid weight loss, but the chemicals used to make them can still cause health problems.

Phosphoric acid is listed in the ingredients of Coke, Diet Coke, Pepsi, Diet Pepsi and Pepsi Max, as well as many own-brand colas.

But while a certain amount of phosphorous is vital to bone and tooth health, scientists say excessive consumption raises the risk of developing brittle bones.

The drinks also contain caffeine which in large quantities can stop the body from absorbing iron.

And some experts have linked Diet Coke’s sweetening ingredient, aspartame, with premature birth and even cancer, although the EU food watchdog last year rejected the claims.
