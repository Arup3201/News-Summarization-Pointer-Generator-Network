From his first audition to securing his place in the X Factor finals, Andrea Faustini has belted his way into the nation's heart.

However, the 20-year-old Italian still can’t believe his luck.

‘I keep thinking back to April when I left Italy and it feels mind blowing to be here,’ he tells FEMAIL in an exclusive interview. 

‘When I think I was in a queue and there were thousands of other people – and now I’m one of the last three in the final and I’m singing at Wembley Arena. It’s incredible. It was just so unexpected.’

Since arriving on British shores, Andrea's life has been in an X Factor whirlwind. ‘I’ve experienced a lot of strange things – it’s been the most crazy time,’ he says.

‘I’ve been flown to Mexico - and learnt to cook and use the washing machine for the first time!’ he says, admitting usually it’s his ‘mama’ who usually tackles these housekeeping matters for him.

‘Seriously, I’m the same guy who left Italy but at the same time I’ve grown so much – apart from the washing machine. I’ve learnt to face things alone and look after myself. No matter what happens, this will really help me in my life, not just in my career.'

One thing that's clear is that Mel B’s involvement in mentoring her little 'Italian teddy bear' hasn’t just been for the X Factor audience.

‘She’s not just been a judge – she’s been a friend,’ Andrea says. ‘She’s done everything to make me feel at home. I’m so glad I’ve had the chance to work with her. She works with so much passion and devotion.

Andrea Faustini belted his way to a place in the X Factor finals with show-stopping performances 

‘The way she behaves makes me realise how you have to be in your life. The most amazing thing I realise from watching Mel is that even though she’s a star, the most important thing is her family.

‘She’s so humble and such a lovely person with everyone. Even if you are successful you have to be humble and work hard and be nice to everyone.’

At the ripe old age of 20, Andrea has never had a serious girlfriend but is philosophical about finding love. ‘What will be, will be,’ he says.

‘I just want someone who makes me laugh, someone who takes things easy and doesn’t stress.'

Even though he hasn’t had much experience in the love stakes, he’s certainly managed to do one thing most men can only fantasise about – bringing Cheryl Fernandez-Versini to tears.

How did that feel? ‘I was very happy,’ he says. ‘When you see someone crying for you when you are singing – it’s so beautiful – you did something good and touched their heart. I don’t just want to be a singer with a good voice I want to give emotion.’

Despite rumours that the X Factor men were told to watch their figures, Andrea says his new obsession is Terry’s chocolate orange.

‘I’m not on a diet and I don’t want to be on a diet. We all try and stay healthy in the house because we have such a busy schedule – but sometimes I just need some chocolate.

‘But chocolate is healthy – because it makes you smile – and that’s healthy! Right?'

During the first two live shows, it seemed Andrea could do no wrong but the tides turned when Simon started dishing out the criticism. But, Andrea says, ‘I’ve always appreciated the fact that he’s been fair.

‘Being honest he  made me realise the things I’ve had to change. And in the last two weeks I’ve received amazing comments from him.’

But it’s no longer Simon whom Andrea has to please. His fate now lies in the hands of the X Factor audience, whose votes alone will decide the winner of the live final this Saturday.

Before he gets ready to board his tour bus to continue his campaign to conquer the UK, Andrea is keen to say one final thing.

‘I love the fact that this country has made me feel so welcome and loved. Thank you,’ he says speaking as passionately as he sings. ‘Being in the final three is such an amazing experience. No matter what happens next, I just want to enjoy it – and sing my heart out.’
