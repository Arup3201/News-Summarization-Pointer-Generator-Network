Jim Davidson was questioned yesterday over claims he indecently assaulted a woman in the Falkland Islands in the 1980s - before joking to reporters: ‘They will be coming to me talking of murder next.’

Officers on Operation Yewtree - the inquiry launched after the Jimmy Savile scandal - are probing claims the comedian committed a sex offence during a concert tour after the Falklands War.

Davidson, 59, of Stockbridge, Hampshire - who allegedly committed a sex offence while he was entertaining British troops - was originally arrested in January over alleged sex offences in the UK.

The former Generation Game host told the Daily Mirror yesterday: ‘I have spoken to police over the allegations regarding the Falklands. I have told them everything I know. I have not been re-arrested.

‘They just wanted me to have a chat with them. To this day I have not been charged with anything. I really am - in the old-fashioned sense of the phrase - helping police with their enquiries.’

When asked whether he was shocked by the latest questioning, Davidson told the newspaper: ‘Nothing comes as a shock any more. They'll be coming to me talking of murder next.’

A Scotland Yard spokesman said today: ‘The man was interviewed under caution - not arrested - in connection with further allegations made to Operation Yewtree.’

Davidson's lawyer Henri Brandman told MailOnline today: 'I would confirm that Jim was interviewed by the police in respect of the Operation Yewtree inquiry yesterday. 

'He continues to vigorously deny the allegations that have been put to him and is helping the police as fully as possible in their enquiries.

'He has not been charged with any offence. No further statement will be made at the present time.'

The revelation last week that the 
tentacles of Yewtree have now spread to the other side of the world is 
likely to prompt renewed claims that the force is conducting a celebrity
witch-hunt.

Critics claim the inquiry has become a 
runaway train, with an ‘arrest first, gather evidence later’ policy 
ruining the lives of celebrities. Yard chiefs insist it is ‘fair and 
proportionate’.

The Metropolitan Police probe is being carried 
out on behalf of the Royal Falkland Islands Police, which has only 16 
full-time officers.

This is because British Police have no jurisdiction in the Falklands, meaning they have no right to charge people over offences there.

A file on the case will be sent to the Falklands’ Attorney General, Mark Lewis.
