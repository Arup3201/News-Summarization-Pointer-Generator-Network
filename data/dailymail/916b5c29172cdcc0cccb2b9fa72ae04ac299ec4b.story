A devastated mother has confronted her son-in-law in court as he finally goes on trial for allegedly strangling her daughter six years after she was found dead.

Gael Schneider unleashed an emotional rant when she came face-to-face with David Pietz in court in King County, Washington on Monday.

'I've cried my brains out every day for 
seven years,' Mrs Schneider said. 'If he can't take being confronted by a 72-year-old 
woman, he's not much of a man.'

She added that she had long suspected her son-in-law was responsible for the death of her daughter, Nicole Pietz, 32, who vanished from her home in Renton in 2006.

Emotional: Gael Schneider unleashed an emotional rant when she came face-to-face with her daughter's alleged killer - her son-in-law - in court, six years after her daughter was murdered

Her husband reported her missing before appearing in television interviews pleading for information, but her strangled body was found by a walker in a wooded area nearly two weeks later.

'I just said he murdered my daughter,' Schneider recounted, ABC News reported.

But for years, there were no charges brought in connection with the murder - until police arrested Pietz, 34, last year and charged him with second-degree murder after advances in technology.

Detectives were initially interested in Pietz as a suspect after learning that he was unhappy in the marriage and had allegedly cheated on her and asked her to engage in a threesome.

Now they say they have built a case on circumstantial evidence - and in court they played the 911 call in which he reported her missing. His voice is quiet, calm, and matter of fact, King5 reported.

Pietz, who had been married to his wife for four years, was finally arrested earlier in March 2012 after DNA and phone GPS linked him to the scene, police said.

Investigators claimed there were contradictions in his statements and he failed a lie detector test before refusing to undergo a second.

Mr
Pietz told police that on January 27 he got home from work around 
midnight and briefly said goodnight to his wife, who was already 
sleeping, KOMO reported after his arrest.

The next morning he said left for work at 8.30am without speaking to Nicole and had no contact with her throughout the day.

Mr
Pietz told police that he called 911 when he went straight to a planned
dinner with friends that night and his wife never arrived.

He claims that she must vanished as she headed to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting that morning where she was going to celebrate 8 years of sobriety. He claimed that he believed she had fallen back into her old drug habit.

Scene: Her body was found in a wooded area in 2006. Police said evidence suggested she had been killed at night - not in the day as Pietz suggested - as she still had her night mouth guard in

However, police said that forensic tests - including undigested food in her stomach - showed that Mrs Pietz had been killed around midnight on January 27.

When her body was found, she was wearing a mouth guard she only wore at night and her wedding ring was in cleaning solution in the bathroom; friends said she only took it off at night to clean it.

Phone records also show her phone was allegedly used at her husband's workplace.

And
DNA evidence showed that Mr Pietz's was the last person to drive her 
car, which was found two weeks after her body in a parking lot near the 
University of Washington

In court, Nicole's mother, Mrs Schneider. added that she remembered her son-in-law acting strangely at the funeral.

'He put his arms around me and said, "I didn't think you'd take it so hard",' she told the court.

Loss: Investigators believe the couple was having marital problems and that Mr Pietz had cheated on his wife

But defense attorneys have argued that their case is weak and that there were no eyewitnesses.

'It's not based on any direct evidence, and it's not going to show that David Pietz took Nicole's life,' Pietz's defense attorney Cooper Offenbecher said, ABC News reported.

After his arrest, she told KOMO that it was a huge relief.

'I can't even tell you, I'm so elated. My stomach was just like it has bees in it. And [I was] thanking God over and over and over for finally granting this prayer to me.'

The mother said knowing her daughter's killer was free was 'absolute hell'.
