A nurse stabbed her four-year-old daughter to death and tried to kill herself by drinking bleach after she faced the sack for leaking patient details to an accident 'cash for claims' law firm.

Dawn Makin, 33, who is now permanently wheelchair bound following her attempted suicide, had been unmasked as a health centre 'mole' after she secretly fed confidential data to her boyfriend who was trying to sign up patients for a personal injury litigation company.

But as health bosses investigated the scandal, Makin who faced losing her job, stabbed Chloe Burke to death and then cut her wrists and drank toxic fluid, believed to be bleach, in a bid to kill herself.

Today, at Preston Crown Court, she wept as she pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished 
responsibility after her 'not guilty to murder' plea was accepted by the
prosecution.

In court: Wheel-chair bound Dawn Makin arrives at Preston Crown Court for the hearing today. She is pictured right in a Facebook picture with her four-year-old daughter Chloe who she stabbed to death

She was found unconscious next to 
Chloe's body at their family home in Fairfield, Bury, Greater Manchester
when a worried relative alerted a neighbour.

Makin
was rushed to hospital in a critical condition and later regained 
partial consciousness but for several months was deemed to be too ill to
be interviewed by police.

She
was charged with murder ten months later but is now confined to a 
wheelchair and is living under 24 hour care in a hospital rehabilitation unit. Tests revealed Chloe died from multiple stab wounds.

She will be sentenced next month following the preparation of two reports from forensic psychiatrists and was remanded on bail.

Guilty: Dawn Makin, left, was charged with murder 10 months after Chloe, right, was found dead. She now lives under 24 hour care in a rehabilitation unit and cried as she appeared in court pleading guilty to manslaughter

Lawyers are expected to read out personal statements from Chloe’s family and submit graphic photos of the death scene and the little girl's injuries at the next hearing. Chloe’s father Michael Burke was not in court.

The tragedy occurred after Makin was warned she she faced facing disciplinary action and the sack for illegally accessing a computer at the Moorgate Primary Care walk-in centre where she worked in Bury.

She had earlier been placed under investigation by the Information Commissioner’s Office for leaking patient details to boyfriend Martin Campbell who worked at the time as an agent for personal injuries claim firm Direct Assist.

Crime scene: Forensic officers at the home where Chloe's body was found. Ms Makin cut her wrists and drank toxic fluids. She was found unconscious next to her daughter when a worried relative alerted a neighbour

Campbell, 34, obtained names and telephones of 29 accident victims who had been treated at the walk in centre then called them himself in an attempted to sign them up and increase his pay check over a four-month period from December 2009.

He was caught when patients started to complain to NHS Bury, saying that a man had called them about their injuries and encouraged them to make a personal injury claim.

NHS Bury then investigated and found the files had been accessed without legitimate reason by Makin.

Chloe’s body was discovered in February last year after her grandmother, Sheila Makin, raised the alarm following failed attempts to contact her. A neighbour broke down the door and made the discovery.

In court Makin wore a black short sleeved top with silver sequins, a green army style jacket with hood, white leggings, grey sandals, pink handbag. She spoke to confirm her name and to plead guilty to the charge.

Investigation: A review of Chloe's death is due to be carried out by child protection experts in Bury

Prosecutor Mr Peter Wright QC said: 
'This is a case in which both experts express opinions but they agree 
that this is a case where the defendant at the time was suffering from a
medical condition.

'It was a
medical condition that subsequently impaired her ability to do one or 
more things mentioned in the act. Both were satisfied it provides an 
explanation for the defendant’s actions.

'The
family of Chloe, the grandparents and natural father and those 
interested parties have all been informed that this was the view taken 
after careful consideration and understand the reasoning behind the 
acceptance of the plea.'

Adjourning
the case Judge Anthony Russell QC replied: 'I’m sure they do understand
the position is a very difficult one for everyone.'

Makin
did not attend Chloe’s funeral at St Joseph’s Roman Catholic Church in 
Bury the following April in an hour long service which heard the 
youngster described as a 'little princess.'

'mole' after she secretly fed confidential data to her boyfriend who was
trying to sign up patients for a personal injury litigation company

Campbell, of Bury, was fined £1,050 plus £1,175 costs in June last year after he admitted seven counts of breaching the Data Protection Act and asked for 22 other offences to be considered.

At the time Information Commissioner Christopher Graham said: 'People’s medical information is some of their most sensitive data and they rightly expect health workers only to access it when there is a legitimate business need.

'Abusing this trust for personal gain is clearly wrong and potentially very distressing for those affected.

'Martin Campbell would have known that obtaining the information was unlawful and yet he put his greed ahead of people’s privacy rights.

'Where greed and breach of trust meet then the results, as in this case, can be tragic.'

A full review of the issues surrounding Chloe’s death is due to be carried out by child protection experts in Bury.
