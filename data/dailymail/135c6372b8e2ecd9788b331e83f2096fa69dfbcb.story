A gang of murderers may have lured their victim to his death in a Bronx apartment building by using Facebook. 

Ricardo Romero, 16, believed he was on his way to what he thought was a meeting with a 17-year-old girl identified on Facebook as 'Chiquita Andy' Friday night when he was attacked in the Creston Ave. building in Fordham Heights.

He was stabbed in the left of his chest, hit in the head with a bottle, and had his wallet stolen as well as his cell phone.

Ricardo Romero, 16, believed he was on his way to what he thought was a meeting with a 17-year-old girl identified on Facebook as 'Chiquita Andy' Friday night when he was jumped in the Creston Ave. building in Fordham Heights

He collapsed on E. 182nd St. where a witness flagged down police who called Romero an ambulance.

Unfortunately it was too late, and he died at St. Barnabas Hospital less than 30 minutes later.

His sister Viridiana Romero said: 'I was crying. I couldn't believe it.' 

The New York Daily News reports that the attack was captured by a surveillance camera.

One building resident, Christian Juarez, has already been apprehended and charged with murder, robbery, and weapon possession. 

Held without bail, he has identified a man named 'Skip' as the one who stabbed Romero.

'I was going through the victim’s pockets, then Skip pulled out a knife from his back pocket and stabbed him two to three times in the torso,' Juarez is quoted in court papers.

Juarez's girlfriend, Andy, said Skip was responsible for the violence.

'Christian had nothing to do with it,' she told the court Saturday. 'I told him to run. I ran.'

Police have yet to confirm the identity of the woman they believe lured Ricardo in. 

She has been questioned but not charged.

Juarez's mother denied her son was a criminal.

'Everything they're saying is a lie,' she said. 'He did not do anything.'

Another man who was active in the robbery, 27-year-old Christopher Garcia, was held on $50,000 bail.

Garcia told police he joined the group when Juarez told him about the planned robbery.  

'Christian came to me and asked me to help out with a robbery that him and his girl was going to do,' he told officers. 'I agreed to it no problem. I get dress(ed) and followed Christian to the apartment.'

Another unidentified attacker is still being searched for.
