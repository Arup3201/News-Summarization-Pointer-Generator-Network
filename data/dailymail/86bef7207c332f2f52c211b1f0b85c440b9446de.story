Dr Suhail Ahmed, 27, lifted his patients gowns and took photos of their naked bodies in a 'gross
breach of trust'

A young doctor who used a hidden camera to secretly film intimate examinations with female patients has been warned he faces jail. 

Dr Suhail Ahmed, 27, lifted his patients gowns and took photos of their naked bodies in a 'gross breach of trust'.

The pervert took pictures of eight woman while working as a junior doctor in Torbay Hospital in Torquay, Devon, between March and June last year.

He pleaded guilty to eleven counts of voyeurism at Exeter Crown Court and two counts of sexual assaulting patients by touching without consent.

Recorder Mr Robert Linford Ahmed adjourned sentence while a probation report is prepared.

He warned Ahmed: 'The fact that I am ordering a pre-sentence report is not to be taken by you as an indication of the sentence you will receive.

'The offences to which you have pleaded guilty are in my view a most gross breach of trust and are almost inevitably going to be met by an immediate prison sentence.'

The court heard the voyeurism charges involved eight female victims between March 26 and June 14 last year.

One of the sexual assault charges involved Ahmed moving a female patients gown upwards to expose the victims breasts and genitals to enable his secret camera to take a photograph.

The second related to Ahmed touching a female patient’s abdomen during an intimate examination.

Ahmed, of Cardiff, is currently suspended. He was released on bail and will be sentenced on October 4.

Ahmed was suspended by the General Medical Council last July.

The hospital said they had been working with the police.

Medical director John Lowes emphasised there was no ongoing concern or risk to patients as a result of the investigation.

Ahmed admitted one charge of voyeurism in Exeter, Devon, between December 2006 and June 2012 against unidentified women. It is not known where these took place.

The Torbay Hospital offences took place between March and June 2012.
