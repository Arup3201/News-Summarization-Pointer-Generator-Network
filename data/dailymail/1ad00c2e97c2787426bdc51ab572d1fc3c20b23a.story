The Duchess of Cambridge is an 'unambitious' and 'bland' individual who should be called Britain's 'Queen Wag', according to a leading feminist author.

In a blistering attack republican Joan Smith, who has turned down an MBE, says that Kate should be compared to Cheryl Cole and Coleen Rooney and claims she has 'done little' apart from marrying Prince William and falling pregnant.

It comes months after best-selling author Hilary Mantel's venomous and upsetting critique of the Duchess, in which she called the 31-year-old royal a 'mannequin' with 'dead eyes'.

Attack: In her book The Public Woman, Joan Smith devotes an entire chapter to the Duchess where she calls her an ‘unambitious, uncontroversial and bland' person who married William and 'got pregnant'

The Bring Up the Bodies writer also branded her a 'machine-made’ princess, ‘designed by committee’, who went from a ‘jointed doll on which certain rags are hung’ to a woman whose ‘only point and purpose’ was to give birth.

Now Ms Smith has devoted a chapter to Kate in her new book The Public Woman, which she has called Queen Wag.

‘By the age of 30, the new Duchess of Cambridge had done little since leaving university except play a supporting role to her boyfriend, marry him with great pomp and ceremony and get pregnant,’ she writes.

‘She had never really enjoyed an independent identity or income — even her clothes were paid for by her father-in-law — and didn’t seem to aspire to either.

‘Unambitious, uncontroversial and bland, Kate Middleton was Queen Wag in everything but name.’

Referring to those who have been branded
Wags, Smith cites Coleen Rooney and Cheryl Cole, then adds of Kate: 
‘It’s all the more telling that the prime candidate, the woman who 
arguably deserved the title more than anyone, never appeared on lists of
the country’s leading contenders.’

Comparison: The feminist author, who turned down an MBE, says Kate is like Coleen Rooney and Cheryl Cole

She claims the Duchess has become famous ‘not for her achievements 
but her willingness to play the most traditional feminine role of all: 
waiting for a husband, getting married and not long afterwards becoming 
pregnant’. 

Ms Smith is best known for writing the Loretta Lawson crime novels, 
and her new book is about what she sees as the backlash against gender 
equality and its ‘staggering viciousness’.

The Reading 
University-educated 59-year-old was married to satirist Francis Wheen 
for eight years and then had a relationship with disgraced MP Denis 
MacShane, who was suspended from the Labour Party for using fake 
receipts in his parliamentary expenses and forced to resign his seat.

Harsh: In her vicious attack on the Duchess, award winning author Hilary Mantel called her a 'doll to hang rags on'

Criticisms: Kate, who married Prince William in 2011, pictured at a wedding earlier this month, is famous for playing a traditional role, not her own achievements, says Ms Smith

The storm of criticism Kate has faced even forced Prime Minister David Cameron, 46, to step in to defend her.

'What I've seen of Princess Kate at public events, at the Olympics and elsewhere, is this is someone who's bright, who's engaging, who's a fantastic ambassador for Britain,' he said.

'We should be proud of that, rather than make these rather misguided remarks.'

But a month after Mantel's comments, broadcaster Sandi Toksvig also gave her strong opinion about the Duchess.

'We used to admire women who got their place in life through 
marriage and having children,' she said, 'but I like to think we've 
grown up a bit. I can't think of a single opinion she holds - it's very 
Jane Austen'.
