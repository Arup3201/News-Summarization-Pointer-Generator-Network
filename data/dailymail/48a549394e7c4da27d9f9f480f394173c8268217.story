David Cameron is a 'mediocrity' who thinks the film Love Actually is a guide for running the country, new Ukip MP Douglas Carswell has claimed.

The rebel backbencher said the Prime Minister and other leading politicians were only in the Commons for the power and did not care about changing things for ordinary people.

He said: 'I think they've just watched Richard Curtis's Love Actually, and think it's a manual for how to govern the country.'

David Cameron uses Love Actually as a 'manual' for running the country, according to Ukip MP Douglas Carswell

Douglas Carswell was sworn in as Ukip's first ever elected MP last week and immediately attacked the Government for failing to give voters the power to sack elected politicians through the power of 'recall'

Mr Carswell, who stunned Westminster by defecting to Ukip over the summer, hit out at the MPs running the main Westminster parties.

The Clacton MP, speaking to the Guardian, said: 'Why do we have to be governed by these mediocrities? 

'Why do we have to be governed by people who read what they read in the Economist and the FT and regurgitate all the failed cliches that got us in to this mess?' 

In the 2003 hit film Hugh Grant plays a Prime Minister who stands up to the US President in a public showdown.

Mr Carswell added: 'They want to hold office, but they don't know what to do with it. They watch The West Wing. They think it's all about giving speeches, positioning, going to Washington. They're not in it for change, they're in it to hold office.

'You can re-personalise politics. The moment I got a blog and a Twitter account I started thinking I can communicate directly with people. I don't need to be a pale imitation of Harry Enfield's Tory Boy.'

Mr Carswell said ambitious MPs 'watch The West Wing [and] think it's all about giving speeches, positioning, going to Washington'

Mr Carswell was scathing about political leaders obsessed about 'going to Washington'. In July Labour leader Ed Miliband and Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander flew to the US to meet Barack Obama

David Cameron was likened to Hugh Grant's Prime Minister in Love Actually last year after launching a spirited defence of Britain in the face of Russian attacks.

In the 2003 film Love Actually, Grant plays a PM who loses his temper with a bullying US President.

He declares: 'We may be a small country, but we are a great one too. A country of Shakespeare, Churchill, the Beatles, Sean Connery, Harry Potter. David Beckham's right foot. David Beckham's left foot, come to that.'

Last year, after Britain was dismissed as a 'small island that no-one pays attention to' Mr Cameron angrily hit back.

He said: 'We're a country that invented many of the things that are most worthwhile, everything from the industrial revolution and television to the world wide web.

'Our music delights and amuses millions. The Beatles, Elgar and slightly less er... congruously, One Direction have conquered the world.'

The Ukip MP's remarks will sting Mr Cameron, who once declared that he wanted to be Prime Minister because he 'would be good' at the job.

Mr Cameron was widely mocked last year after aping the Love Actually Prime Minister's defence of Britain.

After Britain was dismissed as a 'small island that no-one pays attention to' Mr Cameron angrily hit back.

He said: 'We're a country that invented many of the things that are most worthwhile, everything from the industrial revolution and television to the world wide web.

'Our music delights and amuses millions. The Beatles, Elgar and slightly less er... congruously, One Direction have conquered the world.'

He went on: 'We have invented most of the sports that the world most likes playing.

'If I go on too long about our literature, our art, our philosophy, our contribution, including of course the world's language...'

He then quoted from Shakespeare's Richard II, saying: 'If I start talking about this blessed plot, this sceptered isle, this England I may have to put it to music so I might have to leave it there.'

The outburst was immediately compared to the scene in Love Actually in which Hugh Grant's Prime Minister declares: 'We may be a small country, but we are a great one too.

'A country of Shakespeare, Churchill, the Beatles, Sean Connery, Harry Potter. David Beckham's right foot. David Beckham's left foot, come to that.

'A friend who bullies us is no longer a friend. And since bullies only respond to strength, from now on I am prepared to be much stronger.'

The only difference between the words of screenwriter Richard Curtis and Mr Cameron is who they were aimed at.

While Mr Cameron is furious with Russia, Grant was hitting back at the President of the United States, played by Billy Bob Thornton, over amid doubts about the state of the UK-US 'special relationship'.

Mr Carswell was returned to Parliament with a comfortable 12,404 majority in the October 9 by-election after deciding to stand down as an MP rather than sit in the Commons until next year's election.

He said he decided to quit the Conservatives earlier this year, but found it very hard.

He said: 'I was very stressed in the six months before I announced it. July and August were horrible. I knew I had to do this, and I was terrified. I had difficulty sleeping.'

Mr Carswell said the country was being badly run - despite all the people running it going to Oxford and Cambridge.

He said: 'All the people who went to the same colleges, and read PPE, which means they all think they know everything about everything … and we wonder why the country is so badly run.'
