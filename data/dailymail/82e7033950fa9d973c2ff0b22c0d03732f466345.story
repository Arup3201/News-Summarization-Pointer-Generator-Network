Leading liberal Senator Bernie Sanders has admitted he is considering running for U.S. president in 2016 in a move that could complicate Hilary Clinton's long-expected run at the White House.

Mr Sanders, an independent from Vermont, could pose a challenge from the left to Clinton - widely seen as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, despite not yet declaring her candidacy.

Speaking to NBC's 'Meet the Press' show on Sunday, Mr Sanders said he will be using the key battleground state of Iowa to help him test whether there is an appetite for a liberal but independent candidate. If running as a Democrat gave him a better chance of success however, he would challenge Mrs Clinton.

Liberal Senator Bernie Sanders (right) has confirmed he is considering running for U.S. president in 2016 in a move that could complicate Hilary Clinton's (left) long-expected run at the White House.

Mr Sanders, 73, is currently serving his second six-year term in the Senate. 

He has cultivated a following among some American liberals,
especially on economic issues like the growing income disparity
between rich and poor and corporate greed. He is a
self-described socialist who caucuses with Democrats in the
Senate.

'I am thinking about running for president,' Mr Sanders said.

'I think anybody who speaks to the needs of the working class and the middle class of this country and shows the courage to take on the billionaire class, I think that candidate will do pretty well,' he added.

Mr Sanders denied he was considering standing in order to hamper Mrs Clinton's campaign, saying he has 'a lot of respect' for her, adding 'the issue is not Hillary.'

Mr Sanders is testing the waters in Iowa, a state that holds an
important early contest in the nomination process.

'One of the reasons I'm going to Iowa is to get a sense of
how people feel about it,' he said of his candidacy. 

'Look, the
truth is [there is] profound anger at both political parties,
more and more people are becoming independent. The negative is:
how do you set up a 50-state infrastructure as an independent?'

With Mrs Clinton mindful of the need to appeal to moderates in
any general election battle against a Republican in 2016, a
Sanders candidacy could force her to the left in the Democratic
primaries to head off his challenge.

Conversely, if he runs in the general election as an
independent, he could siphon away from her votes from liberals
that she could need to beat any Republican nominee.

American liberals have expressed disappointment with
President Barack Obama on a range of issues, most recently on
his decision to postpone any executive action on immigration.

This comes even as Republican leaders in the House of Representatives block
action on a bipartisan Senate-passed plan.

Mr Sanders said that he has 'a lot of disagreements' with
Obama, adding: 'I think he has not tapped the anger and the
frustration that the American people feel on many, many issues.'

Bernie Sanders, 73, is the longest serving independent in U.S. Congressional history, having been elected to Vermont's at-large congressional district in 1990.

Born into a family of Polish Jewish immigrants in New York in 1941, he was involved in student activism before entering politics with the anti-Vietnam War Liberty Union Party in Vermont. 

In 1981, at the suggestion of his friend Richard Sugarman, a professor of religion at the University of Vermont, Sanders ran for Mayor of Burlington and defeated six-term Democratic incumbent Gordon Paquette by 14 votes in a four-way contest. 

Sanders won three more terms, defeating both Democratic and Republican candidates. In his final run for Mayor in 1987, Sanders defeated a candidate endorsed by both major parties.

He temporarily retired from politics in 1989, teaching political science at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government in 1989  while making an unsuccessful run at Vermont's at-large congressional district.

Sanders was elected at his second attempt, defeating Republican incumbent Lieutenant Governor Peter Smith to become the first independent in Congress for 40 years.

In 1991, Sanders co-founded the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and chaired the grouping of mostly liberal Democrats. He continues to caucus with the Democratic Party and is counted as a Democrat for purposes of committee assignments.

During his time in Congress, Sanders built a reputation for progressive Liberalism proposing a number of radical socialist policies, voting against the use of force in both Iraq wars, and becoming an outspoken critic of the administration of George W Bush in the 2000s.

Republicans have attacked Sanders as 'an ineffective extremist' for successfully sponsoring only one law and 15 amendments in his eight terms in the House. Sanders responded by saying that he had passed 'the most floor amendments of any member of the House since 1996'.

In 2006 Sanders was elected to the U.S. Senate in the most expensive political campaign in Vermont's history. He was reelected in 2012 with 71 per cent of the vote.

Sanders is a self-described democratic socialist, and has repeatedly praised Scandinavian-style social democracy.
