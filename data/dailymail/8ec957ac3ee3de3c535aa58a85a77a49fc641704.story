Antonio Brown has been fined $8,200 after kicking Cleveland Browns punter Spencer Lanning in the face.

NFL media insider Ian Rapoport broke the news ahead of the Pittsburgh Steelers' visit to the Baltimore Ravens.

The eye-opening play occurred after a long punt return by Brown in the second quarter of Pittsburgh's 30-27 week one win.

Lanning's helmet took the brunt of the force and the incident led to a 15-yard penalty for unnecessary roughness.

'I tried to get over him,' Brown said. 'There was no intent to hurt him. It was just a bad outcome of a play.'  

Brown attempted to hurdle the Cleveland man but instead kicked him in the face in a move that made Nigel de Jong's assault on Xabi Alonso look like child's play.

The incident brought laughter from the  crowd delighting in what appeared to be another mauling in a series full of them.

But the respite was short-lived for Lanning and the Browns.

Cleveland have not beaten the Steelers on the road in 11 years, though for the first time in a long time the gap in the decidedly one-sided rivalry appeared to be narrowing.

Ben Roethlisberger passed for 365 yards and a touchdown, running back Le'Veon Bell had 197 total yards and a score and Brown caught five passes for 116 yards with a touchdown. But still the Steelers needed every last second to hold off the Browns.

'We can't apologise for the way we win,' Roethlisberger said. 'We just have to win games.'

Despite the comeback the Steelers survived and held on for a 30-27 victory in the opening game of the season.
