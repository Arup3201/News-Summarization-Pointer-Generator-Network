Paul Lambert will stay at Aston Villa after talks with American owner Randy Lerner in New York.

Lambert’s position was uncertain with the club up for sale for £200million, but he will continue as manager while working under similar cash guidelines as before.

That means he will get funds to use in the transfer window but there will not be the substantial lift in budget he insisted was required to see Villa avoid another season of struggle.

Testing times: Lambert watched his side win 10 of 38 Premier League games and finish in 15th place

The emphasis, though, will be on 
signing players of proven quality – rather than making speculative 
acquisitions – with quality promoted over quantity.

In
 the past two summer transfer windows Lambert has spent a net £20m and 
£13m respectively, and the same scale of finance should be made 
available despite Lerner wanting out.

Joleon
 Lescott is a top target and would be available for nothing having seen 
his Manchester City contract expire – but wages present a large obstacle
 to overcome.

While Lescott
 may prove out of reach the 31-year-old defender represents the kind of 
player Lambert wants to bring in to ensure his team have a more 
experienced core next season.

Despite Lambert’s call for more money going unheeded, the Scot will not walk away from the club he joined in 2012.

Lambert said: ‘As everybody is aware, I 
met with the chairman along with Paul (Faulkner, chief executive) and I’m determined to get on with 
the job of managing Aston Villa.

‘These
 circumstances are extremely challenging as the club is for sale and as 
far as I know there is nothing imminent in terms of new ownership, but 
we’re going to roll up our sleeves, prepare for the battle ahead and do 
our best by the club.

‘The squad requires strengthening, that’s self-evident, and it won’t be easy within the current circumstances. But we’ll look to identify players of proven quality to bring in and get ready for the start of the new season.

‘To the fans, my message is simple - this is your club and it’s a fantastic club. Your support has made it into this.

‘The past two seasons have been tough and expectations, rightly, are high. But success is always built on everybody working together and the circumstances now require us all to pull together and stick together and try to galvanise ourselves for this challenge we face.

‘I’m determined to give it everything I have, the players will do the same and it is our collective strength as a club which, ultimately, will see us through.’
