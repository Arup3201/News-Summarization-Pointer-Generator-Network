You might think twice before allowing a mobile app to have access to your location data.

But it’s not just apps you need to worry about – hackers can now track your every move through your phone’s power consumption.

Unlike GPS or Wi-Fi location tracking, power data is freely available to any installed app allowing anyone with the know-how ti track a phone location to 90 per cent accuracy.

Many of us think twice before allowing a mobile app to have access to our location data.But it’s not just apps we need to worry about – hackers can now track our every move through our phone’s power consumption

Researchers at Stanford University and Israel's defence research group, Rafael, have named their technique 'PowerSpy', according to a report by Wired.

The technique works because a phone's transmission requires more power to connect with a cell tower that is farther away.

It also requires more power when obstacles such as block its signal.

This means that temporary power drains, such as a phone call, will help highlight the type of environment the mobile phone user is in.

'A sufficiently long power measurement (several minutes) enables the learning algorithm to 'see' through the noise,' the researchers write.

'We show that measuring the phone's aggregate power consumption over time completely reveals the phone's location and movement.'

The researchers collected power data from Android phones as they drove around California's Bay Area and the Israeli city of Haifa.

Then they compared their data with the power consumption of an LG Nexus 4 handset as it repeatedly travelled through one of those routes.

They were able to guess which route it was nine out of ten times.

Someday, scientists claim spies could use PowerSpy to track targets, or apps could use its location tracking for advertising purposes

The technique only works if the person being spied on has travelled that route before, and hackers have measured how power consumption changes along that route.

If they don't know your routine, that accuracy of location drop from 90 per cent to about 60 per cent.

Someday, the scientists claim spies could use PowerSpy to track targets, or apps could use its location tracking for advertising purposes.

'You could install an application like Angry Birds that communicates over the network but doesn't ask for any location permissions,' Yan Michalevski, one of the Stanford researchers told Wired.

'It gathers information and sends it back to me to track you in real time, to understand what routes you've taken when you drove your car or to know exactly where you are on the route.'

Last year the same group found that they could use the gyroscope in a phone as a basic microphone. 

The 'gyrophone' could recognise spoken digits and distinguish between male and female voices. 

Millions of people are being spied on by free apps they have installed on their mobile phones, security experts have warned.

Many 'flashlight apps' which allow a device to be used as a torch also secretly record the most sensitive personal information.

This may include the location of the phone, details of its owner and their contacts, and even the content of text messages.

The data is then transmitted to market research companies and advertising agencies to track user's shopping habits, experts claim.

But it is also suspected that criminal gangs, hackers and identity thieves have developed torch apps of their own to obtain personal data about consumers which could give them access to their bank accounts.

The most popular flashlight apps for Android smartphones have been downloaded tens of millions of times. They include the Super-Bright LED Flashlight, the Brightest Flashlight Free and the Tiny Flashlight+LED.
