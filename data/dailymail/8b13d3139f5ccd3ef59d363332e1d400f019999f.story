Love suits the Doctor. He might be likely to get both his alien hearts broken by his new time-travelling companion, Clara (Jenna-Louise Coleman), but he's full of the joys of spring.

In this week's wild and witty episode of Doctor Who, he was kissing any girl who came within reach — a smacker on the forehead for Clara, a peck on the cheek for poor blind Ada, and a full-on scorcher on the lips for detective Jenny Flint.

She slapped his face, of course. Just for form's sake. But the romantic twist has been a welcome wake-up slap for a much-loved TV institution that was getting tired. The first half of this series, last autumn, sagged badly in the middle as the storyline about his two previous companions, Rory and Amy, trudged on.

Love suits: Matt Smith and Jenna-Louise Coleman, stars of Doctor Who, have produced some zingers

Rory was so wet, Amy was so impressed with herself, and the pair of them deserved to be parked permanently in a black hole.

The Clara episodes, by contrast, are zingers. They crackle with fun and playfulness. And they are daring — the Doctor didn't appear until 14 minutes into the story on Saturday, and when he did it was a genuine shock.

There were some good visual gags. Investigating a mysterious Lancashire mill in 1893, Clara broke into the cavernous engine hall to discover it was empty, apart from some gramophones playing the deafening sound of heavy machinery.

For a flashback sequence, the Doctor — in tweeds and a high-crowned Derby hat — appeared in flickering sepia, as if shot on a hand-cranked motion picture camera.

And best of all, when Jenny Flint took on a gang of brainwashed Victorian thugs, she stepped out of her crinolines to reveal a leather cat-suit — just like Mrs Peel in the cult Sixties series, The Avengers.

It was no coincidence that the actress who played Emma Peel was cast here as the villainous Mrs Gillyflower — Dame Diana Rigg. The Dame was splendidly nasty as a temperance campaigner with a gigantic red leech from the Jurassic era suckling blood on her breastbone.

But the best lines went to Jenny, the alien consulting-detective Vastra and the psychotic Sontaran valet, Strax. As the trio leapt into a Hansom cab in London, Strax reminded them of the dangers that lay ahead: 'I strongly advise the issuing of scissor grenades, limbo vapour and triple blast brain splitters. Remember, we are going to the North!'

With Torchwood over and The Sarah Jane Adventures brought to an untimely end by the death of actress Elisabeth Sladen, there is space in the schedules for a new Doctor Who spin-off.

These three characters deserve their own crime series — Vastra is a scaly green version of Sherlock Holmes, Jenny is her Watson and Strax is a lunatic Mrs Hudson.

Good spin-offs are sheer pleasure, as Endeavour has proved. Like Doctor Who, this prequel to the crime classic Morse is television you can watch twice — once for the story, and again for the details.

Watch carefully, and you spotted a push-along carpet cleaner, which was no more than a rotating brush and a pan on the end of a stick: we all had those, stored upright like a broom in the cupboard under the stairs.

And short trousers on a snowy day: little boys weren't allowed to wear long trousers until they were 11, and never mind if it was below freezing ... good for the circulation.

I spotted only one detail that would have made the set more authentic — in the newspaper office, the reporters had battered Imperial typewriters, but no sheaf of discarded papers on a metal spike where unwanted articles were left to die a death.

The spike was the ultimate elf 'n' safety horror: ask any journalist of a certain vintage, and we'll tell you tales of hacks who spiked their own hands, elbows and even heads.

Such scratches would mean nothing to young Morse, who during this short series has been stabbed, has almost fallen from a college roof, and who last night was shot in the hip.

Another detail is revealed — now we know why, in later life, Morse was troubled by an old wound that made him limp. Take a note of that, Sergeant.
