Nick Mulligan had been enjoying a break at the £2million dream home he had built overlooking Daymer Bay in Cornwall

The devastated family of Padstow speedboat victim Nick Milligan yesterday said they were taking comfort from the fact that he and his daughter had died in a place they loved.

The Sky TV executive had been enjoying a break at the £2million dream home he had built overlooking Daymer Bay in Cornwall when he and his youngest daughter Emily, eight, were killed.

The 51-year-old had taken his wife Victoria, 41, and their four children – Amber, 12, Olivia, ten, Emily and Kit, four – out on their boat when it tipped over.

Yesterday his younger brother Max Milligan, 48, described him as an ‘extremely loving father, husband, son and brother’. 

He said: ‘That he and my delightful niece died in their favourite place at the end of a gloriously sunny bank holiday offers a tiny glimmer of light.’ 

Mr Milligan had built his luxury beach house – which he described as his ‘most treasured possession’– after enjoying family holidays in the area as a boy.

‘As children and teenagers we spent many summers and New Year’s Eves at Polzeath in Cornwall,’ his brother said yesterday. 

‘A few years ago he built his dream home above Daymer Bay.’ 

The family spent most of their holidays at the property in the small village of Trebetherick, where poet John Betjeman is buried and half a mile from Polzeath, a favourite holiday haunt for princes William and Harry.Mr Milligan kept his boat at moorings in Rock, across the estuary from Padstow.

The family used the £60,000 rib [rigid inflatable boat], which shared Mr Milligan’s nickname ‘Milly’, for trips on the estuary. The TV executive, who described his interests as including ‘anything outdoors’, had a permit to use the vessel for waterskiing in the area. Last night his colleagues paid tribute to a ‘wonderful man’ and ‘well-respected boss’.

A spokesman for Sky Media, where he had been managing director on a seven-figure salary, said: ‘Everyone at Sky is deeply shocked and saddened to learn of the tragic accident involving the Milligan family.

‘Nick has been a great friend and colleague for many years and his loss will be felt across our company and the industry. Our very deepest sympathies are with his family at this time.’

Guy Zitter, the managing director of Mail Newspapers – which publishes the Daily Mail – said: ‘Nick was one of the most respected and loved people in the industry. The entire London media community will be deeply shocked.

‘He was very, very good with people. Everyone he came across found him utterly charming and delightful, with an excellent sense of humour, and he possessed a deep understanding of the business and the way it worked.

‘He settled down relatively late, but was absolutely devoted to his wife and kids.

‘This was a very successful man operating at the very top of his industry, with a family he adored. One minute you are in a boat thinking how could life be better than this, and the next minute everything around you is despair and destruction. It is just unimaginably awful.’ 

Mr Milligan was known in the industry for being ‘almost obsessively competitive’ with an ‘intense desire to win’. 

Yesterday at the couple’s £6million home in West London, neighbours described them as ‘one of the nicest families in the area’.

Their home in one of the most exclusive parts of the capital is just a stone’s throw from the houses of Gordon Ramsay and David Walliams.

Neighbour Olivia Henderson, 51, who has known the family for ten years, said: ‘It was a horrible accident. It’s so sad. Everyone is just shocked and upset by what has happened. Nick was a nice family man who was great with his kids. He was one of the nicest guys locally. He did a lot in the community.’ 

She added: ‘Little Emily was a sweet little girl. She would be out on the street in her school uniform, playing on her scooter. She was always smiling. 

‘Vicky looked after them so well. They were always polite and well turned out. They were just a lovely, beautiful family.’
