With his hands on his head and his cheeks puffed out, Prime Minister David Cameron took to the streets of Westminster for a jog, as his deputy Nick Clegg gave a press conference.

Instead of listening to what his coalition partner had to say, Mr Cameron set out on his morning run, returning rosy-cheeked and dressed in trainers, black shorts and a black polo shirt.

The leader of the Conservative Party did not appear to have broken into a sweat as he arrived at the back door of 10 Downing Street yesterday.

Running out of time? David Cameron headed out for a morning run while Nick Clegg was giving his monthly press conference

Mr Cameron had ventured out for some exercise at the same time that Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats, was giving his regular press conference.

In his monthly briefing, Mr Clegg had warned Mr Cameron not to let fears over UKIP leader Nigel Farage prevent a repeat of live television debates prior to next year's general election.

It has been reported that Tory strategists are fearful that if UKIP is allowed to take part in the discussions then Mr Farage could end up dominating proceedings.
