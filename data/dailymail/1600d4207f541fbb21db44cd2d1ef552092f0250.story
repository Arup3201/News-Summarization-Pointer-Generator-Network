He could have been forgiven for enjoying a well-deserved day off.

But Andy Murray packed in a more than full schedule yesterday – despite having less than two hours’ sleep after celebrating his emotional triumph in Sunday’s Wimbledon men’s singles final.

Murray crammed in media interviews, sponsors’ events, dozens of congratulatory phone calls and even a visit to Downing Street.

Asked how he managed to keep going after such an exhausting fortnight, the 26-year-old replied: ‘Adrenaline.’

7.55am: Murray yawns as he starts a marathon round of interviews at Wimbledon yesterday

8.05am: With Mike Bushell on BBC Breakfast, the first of six interviews in one hour

Murray did not leave the Wimbledon Champion’s Ball until around 2am yesterday to return with girlfriend Kim Sears to his £5million mansion in Oxshott, Surrey.

Well before 8am, he was heading back to Wimbledon after only ‘an hour or so’s sleep’.

On his way, he took a call from David Beckham and also received a message of congratulations from Sir Alex Ferguson.

Between 8am and 9am he gave no fewer than six BBC interviews, including to Radio 4’s Today, Radio 5 Live and Radio Scotland.

He also gave an interview to Holly Willoughby on ITV’s This Morning, where he was asked again – to his obvious annoyance – about whether he planned to marry Miss Sears.

Later he yawned as he arrived for a press conference and admitted: ‘The last few weeks have been pretty stressful.’

Responding to questions from fans on Twitter, he revealed that he had not slept with the Wimbledon trophy but that he and Miss Sears had allowed their two terriers to share the bed.

At noon, Murray travelled to a deprived council estate in Kennington, South London, where he returned to the court to play tennis against the public as a part of an event organised by one of his sponsors, Adidas.

This is the moment Holly Willoughby found out what it was like to be on the receiving end of an Andy Murray volley – after she dared ask him whether marriage was on the horizon.

The Wimbledon champion snapped during an interview for ITV’s This Morning when the question of his relationship with 25-year-old Kim Sears came up.

Miss Willoughby said: ‘I’m trying to think what your next challenge will be. You’ve had the US Open, the Olympics, now Wimbledon – could it be popping the question?’

In a cutting reply, Murray said: ‘I only met you like ten minutes ago so I wouldn’t be telling you first.’

However, he then added: ‘I haven’t planned it. But you never know. It’s been getting close to eight years now we’ve been together. It’s a long time.’

It is the second time 26-year-old Murray has got a little touchy on the subject this week, after being asked the same question at a press conference on Sunday. He looked unsettled before replying: ‘No ... I haven’t thought about that yet.’

But while Murray  may not want to discuss any future wedding, there is speculation he may be planning it imminently. Bookies are already accepting bets on whether the couple will become engaged later this summer.

Murray revealed yesterday that he was planning to take artist Miss Sears on a romantic getaway in the US after his next block of training.

Those close to Murray have said that Miss Sears, who is the daughter of tennis coach Nigel Sears, brings ‘calmness’ to him while he is on court.

More than 100 people of all ages lined up in the heat for the chance to face the Wimbledon champion.

Those who managed to return his serve had their photo taken with Murray and his trophy.

The star looked slightly bemused as dozens of children surrounded him begging for autographs, with event organisers struggling to calm them down.

He also gave more interviews, including to U.S. news outlets.

Asked how he had got through a morning full of media interviews and television appearances, the tennis ace, who normally sleeps for between eight and ten hours a night, explained: ‘Probably just adrenaline.

‘I’m sure the next couple of days I’ll get to catch up on sleep. It’ll be a busy few days and then I get to relax afterwards.’

But there was no time to rest yesterday, as he was whisked to Westminster, where at 4pm he was cheered into Downing Street.

David Cameron greeted Murray and applause rang out from No 10 aides and invited guests, who included Labour leader Ed Miliband, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and the Scottish National Party’s Westminster leader Angus Robertson.

Murray, wearing a smart navy suit, sipped a glass of water as he chatted with the political leaders in the Downing Street garden.

And he had no thoughts of an early night. At 9.15pm he and Miss Sears arrived at Nobu restaurant in Mayfair for a meal with friends, family and other members of Team Murray.

Of the coming weeks, the new Wimbledon champion said: ‘I haven’t had much time to think. I want to go away on holiday and try and get rest.’

All of Britain would agree that no one deserves it more.
