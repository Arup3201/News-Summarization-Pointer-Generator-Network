George W. Bush is nothing if not a good sport.

And in no better way was that illustrated when the former President donned a Santa suit for a hospital visit in Dallas.

The 68-year-old was handing out toys at the Children's Medical Center of Dallas to patients who have to spend Christmas at the facility. 

The family that posted the picture of Bush to Facebook lost one of their twin daughters earlier this year to a heart disease called restrictive cardomyopathy.

Is that you, Mr President? George W. Bush hands out toys at the Children's Medical Center of Dallas on Saturday

'Guess who just came and gave Emily a Christmas present dressed in a Santa suit with Secret Service and all?!?!?.......... Pres. George Bush,' mom Natalie Smith posted to Facebook on December 16.

Her daughter, Shayde, died in January. 

Her surviving daughter, Emily, has undergone a heart replacement, but is constantly in and out of hospital as her body rejects the organ.

The family have been raising money for Emily's medical expenses on GoFundMe.

There were reports on Twitter that Bush's secret service detail dressed as elves to accompany him.

Bush, who was succeeded by Barrack Obama in 2009, has lifetime secret service protection, as do all former Presidents.

The Republican, who lives in Dallas, has kept a low profile since leaving office.

Special: Emily also received a visit from the Texas Rangers, along with former President Bush

Last weekend, Bush made a surprise visit to the Sept. 11 museum in New York City. 

A museum spokesman says the man who was president at the time of the terrorist attacks arrived unannounced around 6 p.m. Sunday. 

He was greeted by museum President Joe Daniels and Director Alice Greenwald.

Spokesman Michael Frazier says Bush toured the museum and exhibit and 'took the time to shake a lot of hands' from people who thanked him for his service.

The museum announced in September that it had gotten its millionth visitor in less than four months after opening to the public. 

Visitors have come from all 50 states and more than 130 countries.

Bush also does work with veterans.
