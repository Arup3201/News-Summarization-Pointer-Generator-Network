This ecstatic grasshopper looks like he's just scaled Everest as he punches the air in delight after climbing to the top of a leaf.

The tiny insect appears to wave in triumph after getting to the summit of a large hibiscus tree leaf.

Nature photographer Lessy Sebastian was delighted when he spotted the insect in his garden.

Made it! This triumphant grasshopper appears to wave in delight after getting to the summit of a large hibiscus tree leaf

The 48-year-old said: 'I took the pictures in front of my house when I noticed a grasshopper on a hibiscus tree.

'I initially thought the grasshopper would eat some of the hibiscus leaves so I grabbed my camera.

'I approached the insect very slowly and waited in a position that was just one metre away.'

But the father-of-two, from Jakata, Indonesia, had to be patient and was thrilled to have the opportunity to capture this special moment.

He added: "At first it tried to hide, but I waited patiently because I knew that there was a chance that the insect would do something unusual.

'The whole process took one hour and after that I left the grasshopper to carry on with its own activities.

'As a macro photographer I love insects - grasshoppers are my favourite because they make funny expressions in front of the camera.'
