She's been blissfully married to Prince Charles for nearly ten years but the Duchess of Cornwall attracted the attention of another famous face today.

The royal found herself in Sky presenter Eamonn Holmes' embrace on a visit to the newly redeveloped West London campus. 

Eamonn greeted the Duchess like an old friend first clasping her hands in his, then giving her a hug when the royal couple met primary school children in the Academy's skills studios.

Tender: The Duchess of Cornwall found herself in Sky presenter Eamonn Holmes' embrace on a visit to the newly redeveloped West London campus today 

The broadcaster, who was joined by colleague Kay Burley, has been a guest at a number of royal events hosted by Camilla.

The royal couple were on site to open the Sky Academy Careers Lab, a new one-day careers experience for 16-19 year olds. 

The royals toured Sky Studios, including the set of Sky Sports News HQ, and met young people and Sky staff taking part in some of the schemes that form Sky Academy.

The Prince of Wales made royal history by opening the new academy aimed at inspiring the broadcasters of tomorrow - by unveiling an electronic plaque.

It took just a press of a button to launch the Sky Academy Careers Lab, which aims to encourage teenagers to consider a career in the media, technology and business and equip them with the skills they will need.

In the Academy's home at the west London campus of the broadcaster Sky, the electronic plaque appeared on a screen seconds after the heir to the throne, who was joined by the Duchess of Cornwall, touched a tablet screen.

Under the Academy, sixth form students are given hands on experience of life at Sky including working alongside staff on a practical challenge and get the chance to interview a senior employee about working in the industry.

During their tour of the campus, Camilla could not resist trying her hand at controlling the robot cameras when the royal couple visited the Sky Sports News HQ studio.

As Rachel Wyse was presenting, the Duchess sat at a console and used two joysticks to set up the image on the screen and focus it.

Rachel Applin, 31, a camera operator gave the royal visitor a quick to lesson in what to do and said afterwards: 'What the Duchess was doing was choosing the "into the break" shot.

'She did very well, she chose her own shot and focused it.'

The royal couple also met presenters Kirsty Gallacher and Natalie Sawyer, with Ms Gallacher telling them how they had worked their way up to their positions.

She said 'we were runners' and added jokingly, 'I made all the teas and coffee'. 

The royal couple then split up to watch groups of children working in mini news studio,s with the pupils acting as cameramen, presenters, directors and producers.

Tasty? Charles tasted the juice of the Acai berry which grows wild in the rainforest and can be harvested by locals and provides them with an income

In another part of the campus, the Duchess was intrigued by an interactive wall that showed scenes from various departments at Sky when a visitor looked through holes in the wall.

The installation was captioned with the words 'When you find a job, what will be most important to you?'.

Before leaving, the royal couple attended a reception where they met staff and students and learnt about the latest developments in a Sky project, in partnership with WWF, to save a billion trees in the Amazon rainforest over a six year period.

The Amazon was brought to Charles, and he tasted the juice of the Acai berry that grows wild in the rainforest and can be harvested by locals and provides them with an income.

After taking a sip from a tiny pot he said 'it's good' and then headed outside the building to turn on the lights on a 35ft Christmas tree as hundreds of staff watched. 

Sky Academy encompasses a series of initiatives that use the power of television, creativity and sport to inspire young people and help give them the skills and confidence they need to prepare them for the world of work. 

Sky say that their ambition is to create opportunities for one million young people in the UK and Ireland to build skills and experience by 2020. 

This visit reflects The Prince of Wales's determination to encourage training opportunities for young people across a range of industries.

In 2013, The Prince launched Industrial Cadets which is aimed at providing apprenticeships in manufacturing and engineering, and since 1976 The Prince's Trust has been providing mentoring and skills-based activities for thousands of young people across the UK.

In terms of television and film skills, in October last year Tthe Prince of Wales instigated a broadcasting industry Craft Skill Masterclass for students run by the Royal Television Society, of which he is Patron. 

The day was designed to showcase the tools and skills that are required for students to become experts in the broadcasting industry.

The Prince's visit to the Sky Academy is another opportunity for His Royal Highness, together with The Duchess of Cornwall, to champion the importance of film and television production skills and training opportunities for young people.
