A man has been arrested after beating up his girlfriend, chasing her with a sword, cutting her and then forcing her into his car, police have said.

Jeremy Bryant, 29, remains in jail following the allegedly violent incident in Winter Garden, Florida at 10pm on Sunday.

Authorities said that Bryant was attacking his girlfriend in their home when she escaped and ran to a neighbor's house for help.

Bryant then allegedly picked up a propane tank and smashed it through the neighbor's car window before running to their home and smashing down the front door, ClickOrlando reported.

Once inside, he beat up his girlfriend and attacked the resident, police said.

Bryant then grabbed a sword from inside the neighbor's home, chased his girlfriend into the neighborhood and threatened to kill her, authorities said.

and forced her into his car, before driving off.

Authorities, who had heard screaming inside the home, chased the vehicle but when it reached a stop sign, the girl managed to escape.

'The vehicle stopped for a red light, and
 then the female jumped out and ran back to the deputies, and she was 
injured, she was bleeding and said she'd been kidnapped,' Lt .
