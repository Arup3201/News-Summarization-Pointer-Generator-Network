Dramatic footage has been released of a drug dealer's first attempt to run over a man he murdered moments later.

Jake Austin, 25, from Gillingham, Kent, was sentenced to life imprisonment today after being found guilty at Maidstone Crown Court of the murder of John O'Donohue.

He must serve a minimum of 18 years before he is considered for parole.

Austin failed to hit Mr O'Donohue the first time, but then turned the car around and drove at them again. He crashed through metal railings and ran over Mr O'Donohue, who suffered fatal head injuries when he hit the windscreen

Mr O'Donohue, 33, and a friend had arranged to meet Austin and his associate at flats in Grange Road, Gillingham, on the evening of January 23.

During their meeting, an argument broke out after Mr O'Donohue and his friend attempted to con Austin by including worthless paper among cash for cocaine and heroin and the four got into a fight.  

Mr O'Donohue and his friend tried to walk away when Austin - known as Guez or G - got into his Ford Mondeo and drove after them. 

The CCTV footage captured the moment when Austin drove straight at the pair, in Castlemaine Avenue, Gillingham.

The pair managed to evade Austin's first attempt to mow them over by running up a grass verge.

But he then turned the car around and drove at them again. 

He crashed through metal railings and ran over Mr O'Donohue, who suffered fatal head injuries when he hit the windscreen.

Austin, who called his mother and asked her to report the Ford Mondeo as stolen, went on the run and was arrested four days later in Swindon. 

Austin was charged with murder and later admitted the manslaughter of Mr O'Donohue, but yesterday he was found guilty of murder at Maidstone Crown Court and today, he was sentenced to life behind bars. 

He was also sentenced to three-and-a-half years, to be served concurrently, for possessing drugs with intent to supply.

Judge Jeremy Carey said: 'I have to sentence you for the gravest offence in the criminal calendar, namely murder. 

'You were convicted by the jury on what I judge to be clear evidence.' 

Austin murdered Mr O'Donohue by mowing him down in his Ford Mondeo. He had already tried once to run him down. 

Detective inspector Ivan Beasley of Kent Police said: 'Austin murdered Mr O'Donohue with absolute deliberate actions.

'He was calculating as he drove at speed towards him, not slowing down even when he made contact with his victim and crashed through railings and wall.

'John O'Donohue was a loving father, partner and son. He has tragically been taken away from his family and friends and our thoughts are with them today.'

Mr O'Donohue's family said in a statement: 'We as a family know that life will never be the same without John. John's children now have to grow up without their dad.

'When the time is right, however, we will now be able to tell them that justice was finally done.'
