'Pathetic': Labour leader Ed Miliband has come under fire for his bid to shift blame over the Paul Flowers scandal

Ed Miliband was described as ‘pathetic’ yesterday after he accused David Cameron of smear tactics and plotting to run the ‘dirtiest election campaign’ in decades.

The Labour leader said the Prime Minister was ‘demeaning his office’ with a political strategy to ‘sling as much mud as possible in the hope that some of it sticks’.

His outburst follows weeks of negative headlines for the Labour Party, from the vote-rigging scandal in Falkirk to last week’s revelations about former Co-op chairman Paul Flowers, a former Labour councillor who was arrested as part of a drugs inquiry.

Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, said Mr Miliband’s complaints showed the party could not take scrutiny and tended to ‘clam up’ when facing difficult questions.

The Labour leader said in an article for the Independent on Sunday: ‘David Cameron used to claim he wanted to change his party and lead it back to the middle ground.

‘That project has now entirely  disappeared. This is a Conservative Party preparing to fight the dirtiest general  election campaign that we have seen in this country for over 20 years.’

Accusing the Tories of employing tactics of ‘smear and character assassination’, he wrote that at last Wednesday’s Prime  Minister’s Questions, Mr Cameron had ‘hit a new low by trying to use the gross errors and misconduct of one man, Paul Flowers, to impugn the integrity of the entire Labour movement’.

Conservative chairman Grant Shapps expressed his surprise that Labour, whose spin doctor Damian McBride was forced to resign in 2009 after he sent emails  discussing plans to smear senior Tories, was accusing anyone of dirty politics.

‘This is a pathetic attempt to evade the serious issues. Labour have big questions to answer, and when they are asked, they simply try to avoid them by claiming they are smears,’ he said.

‘It is an obvious tactic from the party that brought you the most disgraceful smear operation of modern times, fronted by Damian McBride, and known about, encouraged and tolerated by Ed Balls and Ed Miliband. And McBride was simply the latest in a long line of bullying Labour spin doctors, including Alastair Campbell and Charlie Whelan.

‘Incredibly, Labour’s new campaign chief Michael Dugher used to be McBride’s right-hand man – it’s the same old Labour. We suggest they explain how the corruption at Falkirk happened, and how the Rev Flowers was allowed to become and remain an adviser, rather than dismiss legitimate questions as smears.’

Mr Gove criticised the Labour leader for his ‘coquettish reticence’ in dealing with the scandals. He said it was hypocritical of Labour not to expect to have to answer questions about Paul Flowers, but he insisted there was no Tory plan to fight a dirty campaign.

‘We need to have lots of questions: that’s why the Chancellor of the Exchequer took the advice of independent people to set up an inquiry, which will ask searching questions about what went on right up to the moment that we discovered everything we discovered about Paul Flowers,’ he said.

‘The difficulty Labour has is they were the people responsible for appointing, or allowing Flowers to be appointed, on their watch.’

Mr Gove told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that when it came to questions over the Unite official at the centre of the Falkirk vote-rigging probe, Labour ‘tend to clam up’.

Shameless Paul Flowers allegedly tried to acquire cocaine last week – after he was exposed on camera trying to  buy drugs and after promising to seek professional help.

He phoned a dealer on Tuesday and asked for drugs. He reportedly invited the dealer to stay with him in Liverpool and said ‘turn up and if you want to bring the boy Charlie, that’s fine too’.  Charlie is Flowers’s habitual name for cocaine.

‘I had absolutely no doubt Paul was referring to coke,’ the dealer told The Mail on Sunday. ‘He always used that word for it.’

After the publication of a video showing him handing over £300 to buy cocaine  and other illegal drugs, former Co-op  Bank chairman Flowers apologised for his ‘stupid and wrong’ actions in a statement made through the Methodist church last Sunday. He also vowed to seek help for  his problem.

The convicted dealer claimed Flowers had admitted using drugs since 2010 – which covers most of his time at the  Co-op Bank – and the former Methodist minister allegedly admitted he didn’t believe in God. ‘Paul’s been a really heavy user of coke and ketamine for a long time,’ the dealer added.

‘I laughed when I saw his statement saying he was getting professional help. The only professional help he was seeking was from a professional drug fixer – me.’

The dealer said Flowers ‘sniffed a line of coke’ on Remembrance Sunday morning before going to a service in Bradford.

Flowers has not been home since the scandal broke eight days ago and has been reportedly staying with fellow Methodist minister Ian Hu, 51, in Liverpool. They went to the cinema on Thursday.

Further details of his debauched lifestyle are revealed in a string of texts he sent in recent weeks to his drug dealer.

On the day he was due to appear before a Commons committee about the Co-op’s performance, he texted to say he has taken drugs and plans a night touring the gay bars of Bradford looking for ‘lots of likely lads’.

In the days before his exposure in The Mail on Sunday, Flowers texted about watching porn and taking drugs. He also texted his dealer about a 17-year-old straight student he likes and suggests the teenager watches him having sex.
