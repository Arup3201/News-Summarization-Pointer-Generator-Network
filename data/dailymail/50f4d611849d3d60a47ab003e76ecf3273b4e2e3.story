As many as 1,000 mourners gathered this afternoon to mourn the loss of fallen Jersey City police officer Melvin Santiago, who was gunned down this week in an ambush at a local Walgreens.

The Thursday afternoon wake was being heavily patrolled by police with high-powered weapons and even a tank as Santiago and his killer's death has ignited tensions between gangs and local authorities.

Santiago was shot dead on Sunday as he 
responded to an armed robbery call at the all-night Walgreens, 
authorities said. Other officers returned fire, killing Lawrence 
Campbell, 27.

Security: Many police officers are attending the wake, but even more have been called in for security

A tank lies in wait near the funeral home where the wake is taking place. Yesterday, local authorities received a threat from the Bloods gang that more attacks would happen in response to the death of the man who shot Santiago

Among those attending the wake at McLaughlin Funeral Home was former Jersey City Mayor Jeremiah Healy.

Healy talked to reporters outside the event after speaking with the victim's family.

'He lost his life in performance of his duty trying to keep the city safe,' Healy said, NJ.com reported. 'A terrible tragedy, and a fine young man.'

At the wake, current Mayor Steve Fulop said he would honor Santiago by promoting him to the rank of detective and awarding him a Medal of Honor.

His family has also received a United States Honor Flag.

The wake was scheduled to start at 1pm and last until 9pm. His funeral will take place tomorrow morning.

The event was held just one day after local authorities issued a warning about a possible gang attack.

Police are reportedly being warned of 'retaliatory action' from the gang and a senior law enforcement official told 

A senior law enforcement official told The New York Post the gang had threatened to 'kill a Jersey City cop and not stop until the National Guard is called out.'

An internal Port Authority advisory, obtained by The Post, read: 'New Jersey State Police has received credible information from the Jersey City Police Department about specific threats toward Jersey City police officers and law enforcement.

'The United Blood Nation may take retaliatory action against police officers.'

It is not known whether Campbell was a member of the gang.

A law enforcement source also told the paper a statewide alert had been issued following three shootings involving police in the city.

Angelique Campbell, Campbell's widow, said she doesn't plan to restore a memorial to him that went up in their neighborhood but was taken down by Tuesday morning.

Santiago will be posthumously promoted to detective, of little comfort to his heartbroken family and friends

More than 1,000 mourners came on Thursday to pay respects

She had told News 12 New Jersey on Sunday that she was sorry for Santiago's family but that her husband should have killed more officers if they were planning to kill him. She later apologized for the comments.

'Both families are hurt. Let this cop be laid to rest peacefully. Let Lawrence be put to rest peacefully. That's it,' Angelique Campbell told The Associated Press on Tuesday.

'There's no back-and-forth. I don't want to argue with no cops, I don't want to fight with no cops. I just want to put him in the ground, he's gone, that's it.'

She said that Campbell had slipped back into an old drug habit over the past couple of weeks and 'got back with the wrong crowd.'

Authorities in Jersey City, already 
on edge following the ambush-killing over the weekend, said an officer 
shot a man Tuesday morning who authorities say had attacked him and his 
partner with a sharpened fence post.

The
 man, whose name was not released, was taken to a hospital and was 
expected to undergo surgery for non-life-threatening injuries, the 
prosecutor's office said. The police officers were also being treated.

West District Commander Capt. Michael J. Kelly said yesterday's shooting was not related to officers being in a heightened state of alert in the wake of Santiago's killing.

'Our officers are always in a high-alert state. That's part of our profession. It's a dangerous profession,' he said.

Kelly said condolences have been pouring in from departments across the region. He described Santiago as a quiet, serious young man who had dreamed of being a police officer since childhood and who had just started to hit his stride after less than a year on the job.

According to a preliminary investigation of Tuesday's shooting, two officers with the emergency services unit saw the 25-year-old man at about 2:30am and ordered him to drop the fence post, the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office said in a statement.

Authorities said the man threw the post through a passenger-side window of the emergency services truck, hitting an officer in the head. The man then reached through the window and grabbed the officer's rifle, authorities said. The two struggled for the rifle, which discharged through the vehicle's door and struck the man, officials said.

The officers exited the vehicle and ordered the man to the ground. One officer opened fire, striking the man, after authorities said the man refused to show his hands and hid a hand in his waistband.
