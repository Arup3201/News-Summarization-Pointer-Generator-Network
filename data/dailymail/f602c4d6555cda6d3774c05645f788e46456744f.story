A body believed to be that of a Maine resident missing since 2002 has been discovered in the front yard of his former house, in what police are now calling a homicide.

Charles Woodburn was last seen alive in 2002. The 51-year-old man was never reported missing by his then-wife, Diana Darling, according to police.

Other relatives, however, did contact the authorities about Woodburn’s disappearance. 

Missing person: The skeletal remains of Charles Woodbrun, 51, were found on his former property in Maine 12 years after his disappearance 

Burial ground: Police acting on a tip searched the front yard of Woodburn's old home in Jefferson, now owned by his widow's second husband 

Shallow grave: Cadaver dogs helped officers uncover a human skeleton buried along a wall

Police acting on a tip from a family member arrived at the missing man's old property in Jefferson last week accompanied by a cadaver dog and found a human skeleton buried in a shallow grave along a stone wall, Bangor Daily News reported. 

A backhoe was used to extract the body from the ground in the front yard.

The Maine State Medical Examiner has ruled the death a homicide. Pathologists are still in the process of trying to positively identify the corpse.

Woodburn’s cause of death has not been released, and police declined to share any more details about the investigation.

After her husband’s disappearance 12 years ago, Diane Darling remarried, and her first husband's house at 219 Neck Road in Jefferson went to her new spouse, Robert Gaudette.

'I'm not going to get into the details other than that he has been cooperative with us and helpful in establishing that timeline as to what took place back in 2002-2003,' Sgt Jeff Love, with Maine State Police, told WMTW.

What did she know? Diana Darling, Woodburn's wife, never reported him missing. She died in 2010 at age 54

The woman passed away in 2010 at age 54.Robert Gaudette still owns the property where the body was recovered.

Less than three weeks after Diane Darling’s passing, her former stepson contacted police to report Charles Woodburn missing - eight years after he vanished.
