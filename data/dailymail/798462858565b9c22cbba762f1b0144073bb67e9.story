This time last year, children played on the bone-dry riverbed of the Lavant in West Sussex as Britain was hit by widespread drought.

But today, the same scene, just north of Chichester, could not be more different - with the same river now full to the brim with flowing water.

In February 2012, the South-East was officially declared to be in a state of drought after England suffered from months of unseasonably dry
weather over the winter.

Rivers and reservoirs were at their lowest 
level for 30 years and people were being urged by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to conserve 
water by taking four-minute showers and turning the tap off when 
brushing their teeth.

That was then: Last February, children were seen playing on the bone-dry riverbed of the Lavant in West Sussex as Britain was struck by a drought

This is now: Today, the same scene, just north of Chichester, is full to the brim with flowing water

In February 2012, the South-East was officially declared to be in a state of drought after England suffered from months of unseasonably dry weather over the winter

In contrast to last year, six weeks ago, the Lavant had a flood warning in place and Southern Water has said there are currently 'all-time high' ground water levels around the area

By April last year, 17 counties were give the label 
'water stressed' and many areas in the South and South-East experienced 
hosepipe bans.

But by summer, the country was experiencing the wettest weather on record, with relentless rainfall across the UK.

In total, 1095mm of rain fell over the course of the year.

Southern
Water lifted their hosepipe ban in June while South East Water was one 
of the last to lift theirs in July after 'abnormally heavy rainfall'.

In
contrast to last year, six weeks ago on January 9, the River Lavant had a
flood warning in place and Southern Water has said there are currently 
'all-time high' ground water levels around the area.

There are currently 24 flood alerts in place across the South-East as groundwater remains too high. But despite the concerns over flooding, the good news is that the chance of unpopular water restrictions being introduced is very low.

The Environment Agency said the chance of a hosepipe ban this year is 'extremely unlikely'.

The
huge amount of rain in 2012 means that the South-East - the region most
at risk from drought - has enough water to get through two 'dry' 
winters, according to the Agency.

It
added that reservoirs were full and there should be no need to restrict
water supplies or issue drought permits in 2013, regardless of the 
weather.

Meanwhile, again at the exact same time last year, Pitsford Reservoir in Northampton was just 55 per cent full (left), compared to now (right)

Water levels in February 2012 were 20 per cent lower than they should have been at Pitsford - the third largest reservoir in the country

Today, there is no shortage of water, and no danger of a hosepipe ban either

At the exact same time this time last year, Pitsford Reservoir in Northampton was just 55
per cent full.

The sign 'Buoyancy aids must be worn beyond this point' was rendered almost comical as it stood in the scorched earth.

But now, it too can serve its purpose, surrounded by an abundance of water.

Water levels were 20 per cent lower 
than they should have been at Pitsford - the third largest reservoir in 
the country.

Anglian Water even had to apply for a winter drought permit 
for the first time in more than a decade, so it could drain extra water 
from the River Nene to feed the reservoir in Pitsford.

The UK is 'better prepared than ever before' to respond to major flooding, according to the Environment Minister.Â 

Sixty
years ago, the Great Flood battered the east coast of England as high 
spring tides, deep atmospheric low pressure and exceptionally strong 
northerly gales led to sea water surging over coastal defences and 
sweeping two miles inland.

By
the morning of February 1, the death toll on land was estimated at 307 
in English coastal towns and villages. Many more died on the Continent 
and at sea.

It has been named one of the country's worst peace time disasters.

Speaking last month, Environment Minister Richard Benyon said: 'The floods of 1953 saw the terrible loss of over 300 lives and devastating damage to thousands of homes.

'The tragedy was made all the worse by the fact that no flood warning system was in place.

'Today,
people have a much better chance to protect their lives, loved ones and
possessions and stay safe by signing up for the Environment Agency 
flood warnings.

'While the 
risk of extreme weather has never gone away, the country is better 
prepared than ever before to respond to major flooding and I thank the 
emergency services and Environment Agency for their hard work during the
recent floods.'

The 
Environment Agency said that, despite major improvements to sea defences
and warning systems, 1.3 million people or one in 25 homes in England 
and Wales remain at risk of coastal flooding.

The situation is likely to be exacerbated in coming years as a result of climate change, the agency added.
