A collection of humorous cartoons depicting a World War Two soldier’s experiences of war have been unearthed following his death.

Weston Emmart recorded his time in the Second World War by sketching amusing pictures and writing witty captions which he sent back home to his family to stop them from worrying about him.

The pencil drawings depict the late American war veteran struggling with seasickness on the troop ship to the UK and coming to grips with the English weather, traffic and coffee.

Blackout: The moment the US troops disembarked at Liverpool at night during the blackout in 1944 - all that can been seen of a line of soldiers is their eyes

There is a series of spoof sketches showing the soldier cowering from an incoming shell only to be struck by it on the bottom.

Other drawings show him being brutally treated by a nurse armed with an oversized needle in hospital while he was recovering from being shot in the leg.

Weston died in March this year at the age of 90. His family has since unearthed his old art work and have made it public for the first time.

His grandson Alex, 34 said: 'The drawings were all created during the war at different points.

Artist: Weston Emmart served in France and then Germany where he was shot in the ankle by a German machine gunner

'He covered his training, being shipped off to England, his reaction to English life and culture and then the cartoon of the soldier getting shot, which is self explanatory.

'My grandfather was a talented artist but was always too humble to promote himself or show off these drawings.

'Since he passed away, my uncle and I have been trying to get his work out there for the world to see.'

One of the drawings that Mr Emmart sent back to his family was of the moment the US troops disembarked at Liverpool at night during the blackout in 1944.

Due to the darkness, all that can been seen of a line of soldiers is their eyes.

Alongside
the image, he wrote of disembarking from the crowded troop ship but had
to leave a blank space for the location for security reasons. He filled
in the word ‘Liverpool’ when he returned home from war.

Sleeping conditions: Mr Emmart humorously depicts the cramped conditions on the boat

The English weather: The artist reveals how he was forced to come to terms with conditions in England

'English coffee': Mr Emmart also had to get used to the coffee served up in England

Veteran: Mr Emmart died in March this year at the age of 90

Mr Emmart, from Baltimore, US, served in France and then Germany where he was shot in the ankle by a German machine gunner.

He and two comrades hid from the enemy soldiers beneath a train at Saarbrucken station in southern Germany for two days until they were rescued.

His grandson said: 'He told me that his 
company was advancing through Saarbrucken when they came under heavy 
fire from a German machine gunner.

'He told me that he could see the 
advancing bullets striking the gravel, slowly advancing closer and 
closer to his position. The next thing he knew, he felt immense pain in 
his ankles and dropped to the ground.

The reality: File photo showing American troops of the 8th Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division at Utah Beach, in northern France, on June 9, 1944

Patrol: American troops pass through the streets of Sainte-Mere-Eglise, in Normandy, keeping a sharp lookout for German snipers on June 14, 1944

'The two other men he was with also went down, sustaining wounds to their knees and thighs.

'My grandfather and the two other men crawled under a stationary train on the tracks as their company was pushed back by the Germans. They waited for two days under that train until another company of Americans advanced on their position.

'When the medic was attending to my grandfather, he cut off his socks and out fell the bullet that penetrated his ankles. We still have the bullet to this day.'
