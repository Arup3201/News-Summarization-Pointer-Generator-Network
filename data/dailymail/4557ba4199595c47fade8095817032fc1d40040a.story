A landlord tried to rent out an 8ft by 8ft garden shed for £450-per-month as a 'double room in a garden house'.

Homeowner Greg Farkas was forced to withdraw the advert after realising it fell foul of planning laws - despite a flood of interest from prospective tenants.

The shed on the outskirts of Oxford would have had no electricity or plumbing but 
tenants would have been permitted to use the kitchen, bathroom and washing 
machine in the main semi-detached house.

'Double room in a garden house': The £450-per-month shed that Greg Farkas tried to rent out in Oxford

Mr Farkas, 34, said he had more than 20 inquiries before he withdrew the advert in an area where the average house price is £230,000.

The Hungarian lorry driver ordered the shed for £800 and laid concrete for it to rest on. However, it was never installed.

The full text of the advert read: 'Nice 
location near Florence Park, bus-stops and shopping centers are nearby. 
£450 per month all included.

'There is a lot of space in this brand new 
insulated garden house. Nice kitchen, bathroom, microwave, internet, 
washing machine all included.

'It's a garden house so you use the 
facilities coming in a few steps from the garden.'

Mr Farkas said yesterday that he had no option but to withdraw the advert.

Not so sweet home: The 8ft by 8ft 'double room' which more than 20 people inquired about renting

'I had no idea about the planning laws when I advertised the garden house,' he said.

'I had a large space in the garden, I 
fully intended to insulate the garden house and give tenants full access
to the house facilities.

'I only had the advert up for two days but I must have got over 20 inquiries from people interested in renting it out.

'Some were students currently living 
in Oxford but many were professional people with full-time jobs who just
can't afford to live in their current properties.

'Other potential tenants liked the idea of saving money while they saved for a deposit to buy a house.'

Oxford City Council said he would have
to apply for planning permission for a new dwelling before he could 
rent the shed out to tenants.

Shed with a bed: The £800 shed was supposed to stand on this concrete patch in Mr Farkas' garden. However, the advert has now been withdrawn and the shed is no longer there

Under building regulations, local authorities cannot stop homeowners from erecting free-standing single-storey structures such as sheds - even very sophisticated ones

But if the building is designed specifically as somewhere to sleep, councils across Britain will demand that a planning application is made.

If a shed was rented as a home - and authorities found out - they would have the right to tear down the structure.

However, there are thousands of sheds in Britain that could be used to house individuals - and even families - and councils rarely act.

A spokeswoman for Oxford City Council said: 'For immediate use
of a garden building as a dwelling or ancillary accommodation, planning
permission must be sought.'

Demand: Converted sheds and huge outhouses are common in some urban areas, such as Southall, west London, a district with a large Asian population. Unscrupulous landlords are said to rent out the bedsits to immigrants

Council leaders said the case highlights the 'dire' shortage of affordable housing in the university city.

Council board member for housing 
need, Joe McManners said: 'I think this demonstrates how dire Oxford's 
housing crisis is that people are charging a large amount of money for 
what essentially looks like a shed.

'It is indicative of the shortage of housing to be rented at affordable rates.'Cllr McManners added: 'You do hear anecdotally about people who rent out their sheds or make funny little extensions.

'It's difficult to know the exact scale of it but it is not acceptable in the 21st century for people to be living in sheds.'
