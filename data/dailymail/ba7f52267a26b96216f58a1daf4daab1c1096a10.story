Outspoken: Steve Hilton, David Cameron's closest adviser, has described British Airways as 'fat cats' and urged a cabinet minister to fly with its rival Virgin

Downing Street has been forced to distance itself from David Cameron's closest adviser after he described British Airways as 'fat cats' and urged a cabinet minister to fly with its rival Virgin.

The controversial views of Steve Hilton, the prime minister's director of strategy, have been revealed by the education secretary Michael Gove.

According to The Observer, Mr Gove said in an interview: 'When I was explaining to Steve Hilton that I was going off to the States, he said: "What are you flying? Don't fly British Airways, they are the fat cats. Fly Branson, he is the upstart. We are on the side of the upstarts".

The comments from Mr Hilton - Downing Street's 'blue sky thinker' - will be a huge source of embarrassment to Number 10.

It immediately distanced itself from Mr Hilton's comments by insisting that the views were expressed in a personal capacity.

It also pointed out that Mr Cameron had recently traveled with BA to Saudi Arabia.

The huge rivalry between Virgin and BA is no secret.

In 1993, it led to BA having to pay £610,000 damages for a 'dirty tricks' campaign against Virgin and about £3m in legal costs.

Five years ago Virgin also cooperated with a price-fixing enquiry which led to a record £270m fine for BA.

Last week Virgin Atlantic claimed that passengers would face reduced services and higher fares if BA  was successful in its planned takeover of rivals BMI.

Willie Walsh, the chief executive of 
IAG, the owner of BA, responded by saying that Branson's views did not 
make sense and added that they were driven by the motivation to look 
after Virgin's position and not the consumer's.

An aide to Sir Richard Branson - the boss of Virgin Atlantic - told The Observer that the billionaire businessman was 'delighted that we appear to be Steve Hilton's carrier of choice and would look forward to welcoming Michael (Gove) on board.'

He added: 'We have long fought the "fat cat" of the skies and will do all we can to keep it counting calories.'

Mr Hilton, 42, is a former Saatchi & Saatchi advertising executive who is also a close friend of the prime minister.

He is known for his unconventional 
thinking and officials in Downing Street have previously been forced to 
downplay the views reportedly held by him.

It was reported that during one brainstorming session Mr Hilton asked civil servants why the prime minister had to obey the law.

He is also believed to have upset a number of people within Number 10 through his abrasive style.

Mr Gove's interview with the right of centre Standpoint magazine took place this month.

A Downing Street spokesman said Mr Cameron 'regularly travels with both airlines and that it is good to have two successful airlines competing in the market.'

British Airways declined to comment.
