Star witness: Mary Quin is set to take the stand this week in the federal trial against 'terror preacher' Abu Hamza. Quin recorded Hamza confessing to a terror plot she was the victim of in 1998

A tech CEO is set to take the stand this week as a star witness in the trial against terror preacher Abu Hamza.

New Zealand-born Mary Quin, 59, was part of a group of 16 who were kidnapped crossing the desert in Yemen in 1998.

Quin, now the CEO of Callaghan Innovation, made it out alive, but four in her group died and she vowed revenge against the person responsible. 

Her quest eventually led her to Hamza, when she confronted him at his mosque in Finsbury Park, London.

Her
 recording of their meeting is one of the key points of evidence as the 
U.S. seeks to put the Islamic cleric behind bars for life on 11 
terrorism charges.

Quin
 described the terrifying hostage situation, and her quest to bring the 
person responsible to justice, in her book 'Kidnapped in Yemen'.

In
 the book, Quin writes that she and 15 others were crossing the desert 
in Yemen when all of a sudden a heavily-armed group of men wearing masks
 ambushed them and took away their passports.

A few hours later, a group of vehicles approached and Quin hoped a deal had been struck to secure their release.

However, the group of vehicles were actually government troops who started a firefight with the terrorists.

Justice: Hamza was extradited to the U.S. in October 2012 and is currently facing 11 terrorism charges. He previously preached at a mosque in London's Finsbury Park. Pictured above in court on April 14

The ensuing fight resulted in the death of four of the hostages, including Brits Margaret Whitehouse and Ruth Williamson.

After about an hour of gunfire, the man guarding Quin was injured and she went to seize his Kalashnikov.

'I want that gun, you little b****,' Quin bravely yelled at him, before running to safety with the Yemeni troops.

After
 that harrowing day, Quin focused on whoever was responsible for the 
deadly kidnapping, studying news reports and speaking with diplomats, 
FBI agents and the ex-Prime Minister of Yemen.

The name that always came up was Abu Hamza, whose associate Abu Hassan led the group.

When
 she figured out that he preached at a mosque in London's Finsbury Park,
 Quin decided to ask him about his role in the plan.

First she sent emails, but when he didn't reply she decided to fly to London and see him in person.

She nervously waited in a pub across the street from the mosque for him to arrive. When she finally saw him approach the building, Quin admits that she was overwhlemed with the feeling that she should leave.

But Quin pushed on and stopped the preacher in his tracks.

'My
 name is Mary Quin,' she said. 'I arrived from America this morning in 
the hope of speaking with you. Did you read the emails I sent?'

Hamza
 agreed to speak with her for 15 minutes the following Sunday and when 
she showed up, Quin was surprised to find Hamza in his office with four 
small children sitting on the floor nearby.

Hamza
 quickly launched into a tirade about Algeria, but Quin stopped his rant
 by confessing that she was one of the tourists taken hostage in 1998.

'I am surprised that you would have come here,' Hamza said smiling. 'Very surprised.'

Hamza has long been a reviled figure in the UK where he was reported to have cost taxpayers Â£2.75million pounds in welfare and council housing. Pictured above preaching outside of his London mosque in March 2004

Quin then asked if it was ok to record their chat, and Hamza surprisingly agreed.

On
 tape, he admitted to providing Hassan with a satellite phone and to 
being in contact with him during the ambush. The plan was to exchange the tourists for terror suspects, including Hamza's son and step-son. He said he regretted 
the way things turned out, and that the team was ordered to keep the 
hostages alive and safe.

'We never thought it would be that bad,' he said.

What was supposed to be a quick 15 minute talk ended up lasting nearly an hour.

At
 the end of the meeting, Quin says she thanked Hamza for his time and 
asked if she could follow up with him in the future if he had more 
questions.

'He gave me his mobile phone number,' Quin says.

The
 56-year-old preacher has long been a reviled figure in the UK, where he
 preached a strict interpretation of Islam at his mosque.

'Allah
 likes those who believe in Him who kill those who not believe in Him. 
Alla likes that. So if you Muslims don't like that because you hate the 
blood, there is something wrong with you,' he once said in a sermon.

He also is estimated to have cost Britain Â£2.75million in welfare payments and council housing.

He was extradicted in October 2012 to face charges in the U.S.
