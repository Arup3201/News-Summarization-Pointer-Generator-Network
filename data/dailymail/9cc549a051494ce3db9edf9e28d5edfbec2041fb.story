International rugby stars will be flaunting their torsos in this year's Rugby For Heroes calendar.

Mike Tindall MBE, patron of the charity and husband of Zara Philips, launched the annual calendar.

It features players such as Ugo Monye, Paul Hodgson, Dominic Woldouck, Tom Croft and Ryan Lamb - and there is also a women's calendar made up of models including Emma Frain and Monica Harris.

Rugby For Heroes is dedicated to raising money, in partnership with REMOUNT, to help military servicemen and women transition back into civilian life.

It is the second year that the calendar has been released, but this year it comes with some exciting additions.

Blippar technology, an augmented-reality application that provides the user with an interactive experience, has been incorporated into the calendar.

Smartphone users who hold their phones over the pictures in the calendar will be able to have their photo taken with the player or model.

The app, which has already worked in partnership with brands such as Cadbury’s and a number of charities, uses the cameras in smartphones and tablets to identify images that are ‘blippable,’ and then gives the user interactive options such as games or 3-D images.

The co-founder and CMO of the company, Jess Butcher, said: ‘This is such a great cause for us to be involved with and we really hope people enjoy the addition of Blippar this year.

‘The men and women look amazing on every page, so we’re expecting to see lots of people posting photos of them and their favourite player or model on social media sites.’

The calendars are selling for £9.99 on the charity's website or through Amazon.
