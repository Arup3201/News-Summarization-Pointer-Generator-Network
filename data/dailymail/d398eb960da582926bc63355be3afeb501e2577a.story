Malcolm Turnbull has refused to echo Prime Minister Tony Abbott's dramatic attacks on Human Rights Commission president Gillian Triggs,  heaping praise on her instead.

Mr Abbott publicly flayed Prof Triggs after the commission released a report examining the conditions of children held in detention. 

'It's a political stitch-up,' said Mr Abbott of the report. He told Parliament on Tuesday that his government had lost confidence in Prof Triggs. 

But the Communications Minister struck a different tone on Wednesday, highlighting Prof Triggs' reputation in the legal community and emphasising the focus should be on children in detention.

Striking a different tone: Mr Turnbull today declined to criticise Gillian Triggs, the president of the Human Rights Commission, who he said he had known since she was the Dean of Law at Sydney University

'I'm not going to buy into this discussion about Gillian Triggs. I mean I've known Gillian Triggs for many years,' Mr Turnbull told reporters. 

'She's a very distinguished legal academic. I knew her when she was the Dean of Law at Sydney University. 

'But I don't, I don't want to get into... this has become a very controversial issue and there's lots of allegations flying about.' 

He then echoed remarks he made on ABC television earlier in February, saying the government must focus on getting kids out of detention.

'The critical thing is the children, we should be focussed on the children and getting them out of detention. 

'And the fact is, the irrefutable fact is that our government has got hundreds and hundreds of children out of detention and there are more coming out all the time.' 

Mr Turnbull said the government had reduced the number of children in detention from the 1400 under Labor in September 2013. 

The millionaire was widely touted as a potential candidate if a leadership spill motion went ahead earlier this month. 

Mr Turnbull did not stand for the position and Mr Abbott won the vote without a candidate standing against him, 61 to 39.  

Look, I’m not going to engage in a discussion about personalities, I’d just make this observation about the children in detention issue. When the Labor Party won office in 2007 there were no children in detention because of the Howard Government’s successful management of our borders. There were no boats, there was no people smuggling, and so there were no kids in detention.

As you know, Kevin Rudd changed the policy, there was a massive increase in people smuggling, a massive increase in unauthorised arrivals, and we had a peak of 2000 kids in detention and at the time that we came into government, when Labor was voted out in 2013, there were about 1,400 children in detention. That number, in terms of children onshore is 126 and as you know from what Mike Pazullo said in estimates this week that is rapidly coming down.

So the bottom line is this: any child in detention, one child in detention is one child too many. You know, this is not -- everyone is anguished by having children locked up in detention. We don’t want to have any children in detention. The best way for children not to be in detention of course is for them not to get on to people smugglers’ boats. And of course we’ve effectively ensured that by stopping the boats, by Scott Morrison stopping the boats.

Going forward, our goal is to get those kids out of detention, and of course if they’re not coming in the front door it’s much easier to reduce the numbers and that is what is happening. Peter Dutton, as you know, is very focussed on that and I think we have a very good story. I just want to recap: the issue is not Gillian Triggs, or personalities, or arguments about the Human Rights Commission. The issue is the children. You know, all of us, as parents in particular, know how anguished it must be for children to be in these circumstances. Of course they were put there by their parents choosing to come to Australia on people smugglers’ boats, we are getting them out of detention and that is, that is one of the signal achievements of the government.

Look, I’m not going to buy into this discussion about Gillian Triggs; I mean I’ve known Gillian Triggs for many years. She’s a very distinguished international legal academic. I knew her when she was the Dean of Law at Sydney University, but I don’t, I don’t want to get into, obviously this has become a very controversial issue and there are all sorts of allegations flying around. I don’t want to get involved in that or comment on that today, other people can do that if they wish. The critical thing is the children, we should be focussed on the children and getting them out of detention. And the fact is, the irrefutable fact is that our government has got hundreds and hundreds of children out of detention and there are more coming out all the time.
