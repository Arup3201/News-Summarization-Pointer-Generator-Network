Frozen on the spot amid booming music and dazzling  lights, an apparently terrified owl has to be coaxed to perform on Britain’s Got Talent.

Rocky the eagle owl’s stressed appearance during live auditions has left the ITV show facing accusations of animal cruelty.

The RSPCA said it was ‘very disappointed’ that producers had subjected the bird to the ordeal, while scores of viewers criticised the decision.

Terrified: The RSPCA has stepped into the row over whether making Rocky perform amongst powerful stage lighting on Saturday's Britain's Got Talent, was cruel

More than 11million saw  Rocky nervously take to the noisy, theatrically lit stage shortly after the episode started on Saturday night.

Owner Andrew Charlton led the owl out in front of apparatus usually used by dogs in agility contests before the judges, led by Simon Cowell, and a theatre audience of 2,000.

But when Wagner’s Ride of the Valkyries came booming from the Birmingham venue’s music system, Rocky froze and remained glued to the spot, gripping the perch tightly.

Despite constant pleas of ‘come on’, the Eurasian eagle owl refused to move – and appeared increasingly anxious as the audience erupted into laughter.

Mr Charlton, 53, eventually moved Rocky on to the stage floor and again urged the bird to run through a canvas tunnel.

Criticised: The RSPCA has called the performance cruel, saying it did not take Rocky's welfare into consideration

But  Rocky instead turned away from 
the stage – triggering more laughter from the live audience, with hosts 
Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly getting the giggles backstage too.

After
 numerous attempts, the owl was finally coaxed through the obstacle, but
 the judges had already sounded their buzzers and voted the pair off the
 show.

Viewers took to 
Twitter to complain that Rocky looked terrified by the ordeal. Animal 
experts said the owl clearly seemed anxious, and was probably not used 
to the bright lights and noisy buzzer used by the judges. The roar of 
clapping and laughter is also believed to have added to the bird’s 
stress.

RSPCA senior 
scientific officer Ros Clubb said: ‘Considering the flashing lights and 
loud noises from the audience and buzzers it is not surprising this owl 
didn’t perform as the owner expected.

‘Welfare of the animals should be paramount and it is disappointing to see this not being given due regard.

‘If people are unhappy, we would urge them to contact ITV directly to let them know the strength of their feelings.’

Lin Murray of the Hawk and Owl Trust said: ‘An owl, like all living creatures, deserves respect. It’s sad that people were laughing at it and probably unknowingly adding to its anxiety.

‘The guy handling the bird would have been stressed about having to go on stage in front of so many people and owls are incredibly sensitive – it would have picked up on that.’

Viewer Paul Evans tweeted: ‘Shocking start to #BGT poor Rocky the owl looked terrified, nothing worse than a chained up bird of prey.’

Mr Charlton, of Bourne in Lincolnshire, says on his website that he has been rescuing owls for more than 20 years.

In a statement released by the show, he said: ‘If I had considered Rocky to be in distress I would not have put him on stage. And if he had been distressed in any way he would have taken flight and left the stage. Throughout the process the show was very supportive and accommodating of Rocky’s needs.’

The episode ended with salsa dancing grandmother Paddy Jones, 79, wowing the judges and being awarded the golden buzzer – a ticket straight to the semi-finals.

A BGT spokesman said: ‘We take the welfare of all of our acts, including any animals, incredibly seriously. For Rocky’s performance we dimmed the lights and lowered the sound of the buzzers, as well as freezing the graphics on the screen on stage.’
