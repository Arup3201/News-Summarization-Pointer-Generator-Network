Billionaire T. Boone Pickens has challenged Barack Obama to beef up his workout with some cardio after surreptitiously-filmed footage of the President working out was released earlier this week.

The wealthy 86-year-old, whose net worth Forbes estimates to be around $1.2billion, has previously donated extensively to conservative causes but has taken an activist role in alternative energy sources in recent years.

'I challenge Pres @BarackObama to a 1 hr workout.Â  My cardio is better. Will work out energy plan for America #nosweat,' he wrote in a Tweet with a video attached that shows him running up a hill in San Francisco.

Taking it to the tweets: Pickens is an advocate for renewable energy and he played that into his playful post

Pickens was a vocal critic of John Kerry when he was the Democratic nominee for president in 2008 but the two have since joined forces in 2010 on an energy plan backed by then-Senator Kerry and other Democrats.

The bill has since been dubbed the Pickens Plan and calls for greater use of natural gas and wind power in order to relieve some of America's dependence on foreign oil.

Poking fun: The 86-year-old billionaire is known to enjoy his Twitter feed

This is not the first time that the octogenarian has used Twitter to call out a formidable foe.

In 2012, Pickens caused a stir when he started a playful war of words with Canadian rapper Drake.

Drake posted a tweet in May 2012 writing: 'The first million is the hardest' and Pickens came up with a pithy response.

'The first billion is a helluva lot harder,' he wrote back.

Drake accepted the proverbial hat that Pickens had handed back to him, writing '@boonepickens just stunted on me heavy'.

No word if President Obama is going to be as witty in his response to Pickens.
