This is the moment a heated argument in a Bronx deli escalated into a massive brawl that sent three victims to the hospital.

The New York Police Department is looking for two females and five males from the assault, which occurred at about 4.30am on Sunday.

Two 20-year-old victims suffered stab wounds while a 26-year-old victim had several facial fractures, police said. 

Seven suspects - two women and three men - are wanted by the New York Police Department after a brawl broke out at a Bronx deli early Sunday morning

The suspects can be seen holding on to one of the victims as others punch and attack him. The assault occurred around 4.30am

The video shows one victim getting attacked by the group after he had exchanged words with one of the suspects.

A woman can seen picking up a metal display rack and repeatedly smashing it into the man's body.

The victim was held by suspects as others punched and attacked him as they moved throughout the store.

Two of the male suspects appear to sucker punch one victim in the head and side, police said in an announcement to New York Daily News. 

Two 20-year-old victims were stabbed while a 26-year-old victim suffered several facial fractures. The people involved in the attack can be seen moving throughout the deli, spewing the store's products on to the floor

The fight spilled out on to the sidewalk where suspects can be seen kicking one of the victims before other suspects come out of the deli.

A witness, identified only as J, said that the fight was over a woman, according to NBC New York.

'The first started in there and it came up to the tree in front of the grocery store, and then from the tree, it went back to the window of the deli,' he said.

The suspects, who are described as Hispanic, left with $56 and two cellphones, NYPD said.

They fled the scene in an unknown direction after the assault, according to the New York Post.
