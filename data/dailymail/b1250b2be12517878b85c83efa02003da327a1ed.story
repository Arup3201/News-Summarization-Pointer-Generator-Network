Eleven students from the British School in Rio de Janeiro have been injured after their bus crashed on the way back from a school trip.

The pupils, aged 14 to 17, were returning from a hiking expedition for their Duke of Edinburgh gold and silver awards in Paraty, in the south of Rio de Janeiro state.

But the bus overturned on Tuesday evening as it drove along a coastal road near the town of Itaguai, according to Brazil's O Globo newspaper.

The students were treated in a local hospital. None of their injuries are thought to be life-threatening.

The British School is one of Rio de Janeiro's most elite private schools with fees of more than £1,100 a month.

Children of British parents are given priority for places but pupils of all nationalities attend the school so they can be taught the UK national curriculum.

A statement on the school's website said: 'This is to inform that a bus carrying 11 of our students from Classes 8, 9, 10 and 11 and two teachers had an accident returning from a Duke of Edinburg (DofE) Expedition.

'Everybody is ok but a few students and one our teacher is being treated in a local Hospital in Itaguaí for cuts, bruises, and a broken collar bone.

'Parent have been notified and are with their children. Mr Nixon, Mr Blanch and Mr Hughes are with the group at the Hospital.

'We would like to thank the Bombeiros and the Staff of the São Francisco de Xavier Hospital for their prompt action and attention.

'The time of the accident was early evening, Tuesday, 26th of March 2013.'
