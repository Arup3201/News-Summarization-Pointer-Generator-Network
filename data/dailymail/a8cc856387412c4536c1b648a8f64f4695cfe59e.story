Swings and slides are being removed from Britain's school playgrounds because of the massive rise in compensation claims when children suffer minor injuries.

Claims have become so common that education authorities face mounting bills even when children get hurt while breaking school rules by climbing walls or trees.

The compensation culture is being fuelled
 by lawyers offering parents no-win no-fee deals, it is claimed, with some firms even 
setting up telephone hotlines to encourage parents to sue.

Schools are often advised to settle out of court without contesting claims up to £12,000 just to save on legal costs. More than £4million was also paid out to staff last year.

Jonathan Isaby, political director of the TaxPayers' Alliance, told the Sunday Express: 'There is no doubt that the compensation culture has got completely out of hand. People need to accept that sometimes accidents do happen and no one is to blame.'

Figures revealed parents with pupils at schools in Lancashire have been paid almost £800,000 in compensation for their children's injuries in the past five years.

The payouts include a child who got more than £15,000 after falling off a wall and another who collected £6,000 after cutting a leg while sliding down a banister.

In Essex, school bosses have paid out 
£227,137 in compensation and legal costs in the past five years. A child
 who tripped down a step cost the council £30,544 and a pupil got 
£24,650 after falling off a climbing frame.

And in Kent, the county council has paid out £700,000
 in compensation to children injured in school accidents since 2008. The
 biggest payout to a pupil was £80,000.

To win compensation an injured child has to prove there has been a breach of the duty of care owed to them by the school.

If the child has suffered as a result of negligence they can claim compensation for their suffering and funding for any medical treatment.

Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said: 'Schools become so risk-conscious they no longer present children with challenges and they are wrapped up in cotton wool.'

The National Union of Teachers defended its members for seeking compensation saying many claims result from premises or equipment which have 'not been sufficiently well maintained'.
