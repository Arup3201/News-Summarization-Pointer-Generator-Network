Lord Turner: 'Innovative policies'

A row erupted last night after a favourite to take over the Bank of England appeared to suggest that billions of pounds of government debt should be written off.

Lord Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, set alarm bells ringing when he called for ‘more innovative and unconventional policies’ to kick-start the economy.

He warned that quantitative easing, the Bank of England’s controversial money printing programme designed to boost growth, now has ‘little impact’.

Lord Turner – a frontrunner to succeed Sir Mervyn King as governor of the Bank – did not spell out what was required instead in his Mansion House speech on Thursday night.

But it is thought one option could involve the Bank telling the Treasury it does not have to repay all the £375billion of government bonds it has bought through QE – effectively cancelling the debt.

Such a move would be seen as creating ‘helicopter money’ – a term for when governments print money to finance spending as though dropping cash out of the sky.

Sources close to Lord Turner insisted it was ‘completely wrong’ to suggest he advocated such a policy. ‘Adair [Lord Turner] is not pushing or suggesting any particular policy ideas,’ one said yesterday.

But his speech sparked outrage with critics warning that cancelling the debt would shatter the Government’s economic credibility and drive up inflation.

It also cast doubt over Lord Turner’s chances of taking over as Bank governor next year. ‘His credentials aren’t good enough to look after petty cash in a tobacco kiosk,’ said Peter Hargreaves, co-founder of stock broker Hargreaves Lansdown.

Desperate measures: Critics said if the Bank of England let the Government off its debts it would be disaster for the economy

‘He’s done a poor job at the FSA and he made the wrong call on the euro. The guy is very intelligent but has no common sense.’

Tory MP Andrea Leadsom warned that if the Bank ‘let off’ the Government over its debts it would be a disaster for the economy.

‘The reality is that if you cancel the debt you debase the currency,’ she said.

‘The whole reason we have kept our credit rating and the market is still buying our debt is that we have credibility and investors believe that the Government is going to pay its way out of our economic woes.’

The Bank of England distanced itself from the idea yesterday, pointing out that Sir Mervyn said in August that ‘cancelling the bonds’ would be ‘appalling behaviour’.

The QE programme was launched in 2009 in an attempt to drag the economy out of recession. Critics claim it has destroyed the retirement plans of a million workers by driving down annuity rates.

n Bank of England deputy governor Paul Tucker last night warned of  an ‘uncontainable’ backlash if taxpayers are forced to bail out banks again. ‘The objective is to get to a position where public money is never used to provide support for a bank failure,’ he told the Institute for International Finance in Tokyo.

If Adair Turner believes the Government should be let off the hook for its QE debt, then it would be very dangerous to let him anywhere near the top job at the Bank of England, writes Ruth Sunderland.

He has made no secret of his desire to step into the shoes of Sir Mervyn King, pictured right, and it would make for an eye-catching job application: ‘Hire me, Mr Osborne, and I’ll forget the £375billion of QE money you owe the Bank’.

Lord Turner’s aides yesterday denied that he is proposing to cancel QE borrowings.

But he has apparently briefed BBC business editor Robert Peston and there was a remarkably well-informed piece this week by a leading Guardian columnist, vaunting Turner as a ‘breath of fresh air’. 

That article mentioned Turner’s ‘private view’ that the UK should look at ‘monetising’  debt and consider ‘blatantly printing money’.

QE involves the Bank creating money and using it to buy up gilts, or government debt, from pension funds and banks.

The money that flows into the wider economy then, in theory, stimulates growth.

Printing money to finance the Government’s debts may sound like an easy and tempting solution, but many serious economists would condemn it as the fast-track to ruin. It’s not so very different  from you or  I paying our mortgages by  setting up a counterfeiting press in the back bedroom – and similarly, it is probably not even legal.

Money printing followed by debt default is behaviour associated with a banana republic.

As well as the risk of unleashing rampant inflation, it would jeopardise our reputation on the money markets as a credit-worthy country.

Pensioners, who have already seen their life-savings depleted by QE, would suffer even more. It would also make a mockery of attempts to control runaway public spending. Why bother, if the bills need never be paid?

It is not only the  economics of the madhouse, it is morally bankrupt.
