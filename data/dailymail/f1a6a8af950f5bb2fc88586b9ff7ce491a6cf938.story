Tottenham are listening to offers for skipper Younes Kaboul this month - just five months after he was given the armband.

Spurs have put a number of their squad up for sale in an attempt to free up money for Mauricio Pochettino to put his stamp on the team.

And Kaboul is emerging as a shock name on the list of players Spurs are prepared to offload, despite the fact he is club captain.

Kaboul has failed to establish a successful partnership with Belgian defender Jan Vertonghen

The Frenchman has lost his place in the starting line up in recent weeks, with Pochettino preferring Federico Fazio and Jan Vertonghen in central defence.

And if the price is right, Pochettino is prepared to let his captain leave White Hart Lane before the transfer deadline.

Besiktas have shown an interest in Kaboul, but failed to strike a deal with Spurs over a swoop.

'Younes Kaboul was on our shortlist but unfortunately we have not been able to agree on price,' said Besiktas vice-president Ahmet Nur Cebi.

'I do not see this transfer as being financially viable, we cannot meet the price Tottenham want for him, the only way this deal can go ahead is if we agree on price.'
