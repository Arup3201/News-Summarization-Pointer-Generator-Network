Raphael Varane fired France to a 1-0 win over Sweden in a friendly at Stade Velodrome on Tuesday.

The France captain headed home a corner from Antoine Griezmann in the 83rd minute. His Real Madrid teammate Karim Benzema had an opportunity to double the lead from the spot three minutes later but fired his penalty over the bar.

France coach Didier Deschamps made eight changes to the side that drew 1-1 with Albania last week, while an uninspired Sweden side played without striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who was rested.

France left-back Layvin Kurzawa was replaced in the 78th after pulling his left hamstring.

France dominated possession from the outset to put pressure on Sweden, which almost turned the ball into his own net in the 33rd and the 38th.

The hosts' most spectacular play came just after the half an hour mark when midfielder Mathieu Valbuena chested a cross from Dimitri Payet to hit a bicycle kick that sailed wide.

France striker Andre-Pierre Gignac then split the Sweden defense with a through ball for Griezmann in the 36th but a heavy touch from the Atletico Madrid forward allowed goalkeeper Andreas Isaksson to collect the ball.

Sweden, who beat France 2-0 in their previous meeting at Euro 2012, nearly scored against the run of play four minutes before half-time with a spinning shot from Isaac Kiese Thelin but he was denied by goalkeeper Steve Mandanda, who made a diving save.

Gignac and Griezmann were again France's most threatening players after the break. Gignac controlled a cut back from Payet in the 49th minute but had his close-range attempt saved by Isaksson with his right leg. 

Then, Griezmann pounced on a header across goal from Gignac in the 58th for an overhead kick that went wide. Two minutes later, Varane redirected a corner toward Griezmann, whose powerful strike was parried by Isaksson.

The Sweden goalkeeper also stopped an angled shot from substitute Moussa Sissoko in the 79th but was helpless when Varane planted his header into the bottom corner.

Benzema replaced Gignac in the 68th but failed to convert a penalty awarded after substitute Oscar Wendt handled the ball.

Deschamps is enjoying his best season at the helm of the France team with 10 wins, four draws and one loss in the year, compared to five wins, two draws and five losses in 2013.

France next play Brazil in a friendly in March while Sweden visit Moldova for a Euro 2016 qualifier.
