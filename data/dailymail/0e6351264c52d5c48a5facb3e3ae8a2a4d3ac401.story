MC Harvey has opened up about his split with ex-wife Alesha Dixon, telling Celebrity Big Brother housemates he 'got off lightly' after his affair with singer Javine Hylton was exposed.

The So Solid rapper spoke of the regret he felt following the collapse of their one-year marriage.

He also revealed that his actions which led to their divorce in 2006 had gone on to affect all of his relationships.

Opening up: MC Harvey told his housemates that his ex-wife Alesha Dixon handled their divorce 'graciously'

Sitting in the garden, talking to Danica Thrall and Jasmine Lennard, he told the girls his version of events after Alesha found out he had cheated on her with singer Javine, 30, just a year after they wed.

Addressing reports that he and Alesha, 33, had a massive fallout after news of his infidelities surfaced, Harvey, 33, said: 'Since the day that I actually got divorced there’s never been one 
cross word or beef.

'I got off lightly, she dealt with it graciously.'

However, Harvey also opened up about the pain he felt when Dixon, who he dated for five years before getting married, eventually left without even putting up a fight.

He said: 'What made it worse is when she went I'll
take what's mine and you take what's yours and get out of my life, and I
was like "oh!"'

Speaking highly of her loyal nature, Harvey added: 'I 
was that girl’s world. Her eyes didn't go left her eyes didn't go right; I was her man, I was her husband.' 

MC Harvey and singer Javine, with whom he co-starred in West End show Daddy Cool, went on to have daughter Angel in 2008.

Adding her two cents: Jasmine told Harvey that it was good that they didn't have children otherwise his affair would have been received far worse

Harvey added to his CBB housemates that the thing he was most upset about was the hurt he caused by lying in church on the day he married Alesha.

He continued: 'I regret the pain that I caused. I
lied to God as we got married in a church.'

The 33-year-old also confessed that cheating on the Britain's Got Talent judge has made finding love harder, as he has since struggled to settle down.

He added: 'What makes it worse, every 
time I get serious with a girl they go back to that moment.'

Adding her two cents, Jasmine said the fact the couple didn't have children made his affair OK, as she believed he would have never cheated if they did have a family together.

The 27-year-old said: 'I don’t believe you would have done that if kids were involved.'

Not happy: Rhian Sugden took to the Diary Room to talk about how she was after her fallout with Jasmine

Also in Tuesday night's CBB round-up, Jasmine's attitude was all the contestants could talk about, following her blow up last night with Rhian Sugden.

Coronation Street legend Julie Goodyear referred to her as 'looney' and Julian Clary said that he was doing his best to avoid her.

At the start of the episode Rhian took to the Diary Room to talk about how she was feeling after her row with Jasmine.

Feeling drained: Julie Goodyear told the glamour model that Jasmine's attitude was tiring

When questioned about how she was feeling, she told Big Brother: 'I feel horrific today because of what happened last night. I can’t help but feel bad on Jasmine.'

Upset at the whole situation she continued: 'Why should everyone have to tip toe around her? I don’t like confrontation.

'It’s draining for the rest of the house, unnecessary drama and it has to be me who has to deal with it. She’s this feisty Queen of the Damned.'

'She's trying to fake me': Harvey told Ashley McKenzie that he believed Jasmine was using him

And at the end of the show, Harvey told Olympian Ashley McKenzie that he believed the feisty model was 'fake' as they sat in the hot tub.

The MC said: 'This girl 
is trying to use me, now she’s trying to fake me. I listen ‘cos I’m a 
nice guy but she’s trying to fake me.'

Brand new: The feisty model took to the Diary Room to reveal that she believed she was changing for the better

Meanwhile in the Diary Room , the model was boasting about the fact that she felt people in the house liked her.

Jasmine said: 'These people have changed me for the better, its hardcore emotional boot camp sort of stuff, it’s hard. They are seeing my madness and my badness. I’m finding people are coming to me completing and encouraging me.

'There’s people that like me here and that’s really cool,' she smiled.

Rockstar: For today's shopping task housemates had to spend big and Martin Kemp was asked by Big Brother to wreck a hotel room in three minutes which he successfully completed

Yesterday (Tuesday) marked the first day of the housemates' shopping task.

And it was all about spending big, as the contestants had to spend to win money for their shopping task, as Big Brother gave housemates £1000 to try and blow before the end of the day.

Harvey quickly became Big Brother's first target as he was asked to come into the Diary Room several times to buy a red zentai suit for £5.

He agrees and over the afternoon he is called into the Diary Room seven times and ends up buying six before turning down the seventh suit.

Martin Kemp showed off his rockstar ways as he was sent a mission to trash a hotel room to add to their shopping fund.
