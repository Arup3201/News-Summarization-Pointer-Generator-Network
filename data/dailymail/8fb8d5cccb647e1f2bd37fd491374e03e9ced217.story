The man who bought a winning, $70 million lottery ticket in San Francisco has stepped forward to claim his prize.

California Lottery officials identified the winner on Wednesday as 41-year-old Eurico Chin.

They say Chin bought the ticket on a whim at a Safeway in the city's Sunset District while out walking last month.

'I thought to myself, "why not?’” he said, according to a press release
 from the California Lottery. 'I’m already here, might as well buy one.'

His ticket matched all six winning numbers for the SuperLotto Plus jackpot. Lottery officials say he is not interested in doing media interviews.

Chin told lottery officials he learned he had won the day after the May 24 draw.

'I was watching the news and I saw that the winner was on Noriega 
(Street) and I remembered that I bought the ticket on Noriega,' he said. 'I thought to myself, "Well, it might be 
me.’”

Even though he knew he'd won, he to claim his prize so he could conduct research and create a plan for the money.

'You have to plan carefully about what to do with the money,' he said in the statement.

Chin is now deciding whether to take a lump-sum payment, which Lottery officials estimate to be about $41 million before taxes, or to take the annuity option, which would allow him to collect the full winnings over the course of 30 years.

Chin's strategy for the money, according to the press release, is to invest the majority of the winnings and then maybe also buy a new car and a house.

Chin, who currently is not working, says he will most likely retire now that he is a multi-millionaire.

The Safeway that sold Chin the ticket also will receive $350,000 for selling the winning ticket.
