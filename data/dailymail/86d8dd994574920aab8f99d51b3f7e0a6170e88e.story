Ed Miliband has urged Labour MPs not to panic about public concern over immigration – despite polls showing the party’s reputation on the issue slumping to a six year low amid a surge in support for Ukip.

The embattled Labour leader told a private meeting of MPs that the party could not ‘out-Ukip Ukip’. He insisted Labour had the right policies on immigration and told MPs they needed to just ‘keep going on at it’, a source told MailOnline.

But Mr Miliband risks accusations of being in denial over the scale of the party’s problem on immigration in the wake of last week’s shock by-election in Heywood and Middleton, which saw Ukip fall just 600 votes short of beating Labour in its Greater Manchester heartland.

Just 13 per cent of the public say Labour has the best policies on immigration, the lowest level since September 2008

A damning YouGov survey released today reveals Labour’s poll rating on immigration has fallen to its lowest since September 2008 – despite Mr Miliband unveiling the party’s set-piece pledges on the issue over the weekend.

On Sunday, Mr Miliband announced that migrants would have to ‘earn the right’ to claim benefits and face English language tests before taking up jobs.

Stronger border controls and laws to stop ‘exploitation that has undermined wages of local workers’ will also be introduced, he said.

Despite the pledges, just 13 per cent of the public back Labour’s policies on immigration, according to YouGov.

Meanwhile, more than four in 10 Ukip supporters who say they are going to back the party at the election claim the single biggest reason is immigration

Labour MP Graham Stringer said voters in Heywood and Middleton had turned their backs on Labour because of immigration.

He said: ‘You only had to knock on three or four doors in Middleton or Heywood to find that what people were talking about was immigration.

‘Now, immigration is a very complicated issue, but you can’t hope to win elections if you don’t talk about what the people are talking about.’

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper has also admitted that the issue is a problem. She said: ‘We should talk more about immigration and the things people are worried about.’

But Mr Miliband, speaking to a meeting of the Labour Parliament Party in the Commons last night, dismissed calls for Labour to take a tougher line on immigration.

An MP said: ‘He said immigration was obviously an issue, but there’s more to it. He said there was a deeper malaise with the main political parties.

‘If there is an issue around immigration we can’t just out Ukip Ukip. He said our policy was correct and we needed to keep going on at it.’

Another MP at the meeting said Mr Miliband told them it was no good offering ‘quick fixes’ and called on the party to keep pushing Labour’s message on immigration.

In a thinly veiled rebuke to Labour MPs calling for the party to talk more about immigration Mr Miliband also told the meeting that ‘describing the problem is not a solution’.

A Labour source told MailOnline the party would unveil new measures on immigration in the coming months. 

He said Labour's policies would be focussed on making sure immigrants were integrated into the community, forced to contribute to the system before claiming benefits and protected from exploitation.
