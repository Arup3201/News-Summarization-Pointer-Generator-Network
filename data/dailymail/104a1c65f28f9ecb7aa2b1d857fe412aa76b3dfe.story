With its dark panelled walls and shelves crammed with books, there are hardly any clues to suggest this cosy study isn't at the heart of Oxford University and its dreaming spires.

But the seemingly old-fashioned room has only just been installed at Ashton Sixth Form College in Greater Manchester to encourage its students to set their sights on the UK’s top universities.

A room at the college has been completely made-over to resemble an Oxford Don's study as part of a new initiative launched this year to send more state pupils from the area to Oxford and Cambridge.

Inspiring: The make-over is part of an initiative to send more state pupils to top universities

Lecturers from Oxford’s Pembroke College and leading local universities, including Manchester, will travel to Ashton Sixth Form College to hold lectures and tutorials with A-level students.

They will also coach them in the daunting admission process.

College principal Janet Nevins, herself an Oxford graduate, said that for too long elite universities had recruited disproportionately from private schools.

She said: 'As someone totally committed to the furthering of academic skills and a love of learning, I am so pleased that we have been chosen.'

Ms Nevins added: 'I think we are doing something really quite special here.'

The idea that Oxbridge-esque surroundings may help to inspire pupils from poorer backgrounds is nothing new.

In 2012, Brooke House Sixth Form College in Hackney spent £10,000 building a room based on that of an Oxford don in order to put students at ease during the interview process.

A-level students at the college found themselves surrounded by leather bound books in the room, and elaborate statues were placed outside the windows to mimic top universities' ornate gardens.

The Brook House scheme was another partnership with Pembroke College and has seen a number of tutors hold seminars designed to increase pupils understanding of what to expect at a top university.

Headmaster of Brooke House, Ken Warman, said: 'If you go to Oxford it is a daunting experience. But if our students have already done it, they will be much more able to cope without being thrown by the unfamiliar surroundings.

'The pupils here really like it and are wowed every time they step inside because it’s something different to what they usually see, especially with all the books around the room and the cosy atmosphere.'

The room is also used for teaching, with tutors from Pembroke college holding seminars. Students can apply for Easter and summer schools to help with Oxford interviews, and visit the university to get used to the environment.

The real deal: It is hoped the room, part of a project with Pembroke College, Oxford, will encourage more students from disadvantaged backgrounds to apply for the world famous university

Mr Warman added: 'One or two of our 
pupils go to Oxford every year for interviews. Last year, one attended 
Oxford and another went to Cambridge.

'We spoke to former pupils who had been intimidated by going to the Oxbridge interviews and they helped us with the design.

'In total, including the building work, the whole project cost about £10,000 but we think it’s worth it.'

Figures from Brooke College reveal 319 students went to university in 2011, with 75 per cent of them the first in their family to do so.
