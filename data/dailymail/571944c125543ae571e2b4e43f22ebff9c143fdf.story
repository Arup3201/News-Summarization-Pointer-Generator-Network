A university professor has decided to live inside a dumpster for an entire year in a radical experiment to see if people would be happier living a simpler lifestyle.

After formulating and finalising his plans for the undertaking last year, Professor Jeff Wilson has now been housed in the 36-square-foot container for more than seven months.

He may even continue living in the dumpster for another year if he feels like continuing with the much simpler life - which he claims to prefer.

Professor Jeff Wilson has been living in this dumpster for seven months now and says he may yet stay for another year

The dumpster was large enough to fit a bed and a few pieces of Mr Wilson's (pictured) furniture

But it was just an empty barren space before he filled it with his possessions

Mr Wilson, who is dean of the University College at Huston-Tillotson in Texas, USA, said the toughest part of his challenge was dealing with the temperature inside the dumpster.

The heat hit 45C in the summer and reaches -5C in the winter.

Having now built temperature controls, though, he said he is focusing on communicating the design aspect of the project.

However, managing the smells from the toilet can also be an issue.

He said: 'We hope the dumpster will become a conversation box on subjects as wide as tiny housing, energy sustainability, science education, and higher quality of life.

'Ultimately, the hypothesis we are investigating is if a person can have a relatively good and happy life by downsizing.

'This is an outlier experiment. The students and university, thought they thought the experiment a bit odd, have warmed to the idea, even if they do stand upwind of me more than they used to.'
