Siem de Jong is set to make his Newcastle United debut at Aston Villa on Saturday after recovering from a calf injury.

The former Ajax captain – a £6million summer signing – missed the back end of pre-season as well as Sunday’s league opener against Manchester City.

The Magpies were beaten 2-0 by the champions, failing to register a shot on target, and boss Alan Pardew said afterwards that the return of De Jong would aid his side’s offensive threat.

Fighting fit: De Jong is poised to make his debut for Newcastle this weekend

And Pardew has now confirmed that the Holland international will feature for the lunchtime trip to Villa Park.

‘Siem de Jong has trained all week and will be in the squad for Villa,’ he said.

‘He missed last week, he is back this week and I think he is keen to start – we will have to wait and see if he is ready – but his enthusiasm is good and his CV and quality speak for themselves and hopefully he can produce a great season for us.’

Meanwhile, Cheick Tiote – a target of Lokomotiv Moscow – remains sidelined with a hamstring problem.

But Pardew added: ‘Tiote has been running outside and working towards training.’
