A pre-teen girl attempts to fake her first period, using glitter no less, in a hilarious new ad for Hello Flo's Period Starter Kit- but her mother teaches her a lesson she'll never forget.

In 'First Moon Party' Katie's scheme is brilliantly foiled by her mom, who throws an excruciatingly embarrassing 'first period party,' eventually leading her daughter to fess up.

The bash features cringe-inducing activities, such as a 'uterus piñata' and  a 'pin the pad on the period' game. There’s even an allusion to 'vagina cake.'  Unsurprisingly, the video has garnered more than 1.8 million views since it was uploaded to YouTube on Tuesday.

Not buying it: Hello Flo's new ad sees a pre-teen fake her first period by painting a sanitary pad with red nail polish, not fooling her mother (pictured) for a moment

Katie opens the ad lamenting the fact that she has yet to start her period. 'First, Jenny got it. Then, stupid Vicki got it. And I tried everything to get my period,' says Katie. 'Nothing. So, I faked it.'

Katie's masterful plan involves dotting a sanitary pad with red glittery nail polish and the young girl appears quite smug with her handiwork; bragging to her friends on the phone and leaving the pad lying around for her mother to find.

'Hey Katie, what's this?' her mother asks, waggling the item in question.

'What do you think it is?' responds Katie sarcastically. 'I'm on my lady's days.'

'What do I think it is?' her mother says, speaking to the camera. 'Rubylicious nail polish. But she doesn't need to know that.'

Everyone's invited: Hordes of guests show up to the hilariously embarrassing soiree, including Katie's grandpa (center) and school friends (right)

Katie's mother then informs her daughter that, as per 'family tradition,' she will be throwing a 'first moon party' to celebrate this momentous stepping stone in her path towards womanhood.

After she calls to inquire as to the availability of a 'vagina cake,' the front door flies open and the party begins.

'This party is a hit. Your grandpa is bobbin' for ovaries like a champ'

'You're so grown up!' squeals Katie's grandfather with an animated embrace.

'There she is! I got you the super pack,' offers one of her mother's 'co-workers,' handing Katie an auspicious looking package.

'These are coffee filters,' Katie responds dejectedly.

'Yeah, I wasn't sure what brand you liked,' chortles the man.

Highlights: What period-themed party would be complete without a 'uterus piñata' (left) and a 'pin the pad on the period' game (right)

Marshmallow anyone? Katie is scarred by the party's inclusion of a bright red confectionary dipping fountain (pictured)

An outlandish series of period-themed children's games ensues, including 'pin the pad on the period,' a 'uterus pinata,' a 'vagician,' and a bright red marshmallow dipping fountain.

'I used to like marshmallows,' the poor girl mutters. 'Not anymore.'

'You need to stop this! No one is having fun,' Katie implores to her mother.

'What are you taking about?' her mother returns. 'This party is a hit. Your grandpa is bobbin' for ovaries like a champ.'

The life of a tween: Katie begs her mother to end the horrendous party, to which her mother responds, 'This party is a hit. Your grandpa is bobbin for ovaries like a champ'

The stuff of nightmares: When Katie's father pops out of a giant cake like a jack-in-the-box (pictured), she reaches her cringe-threshold, and finally comes clean to her mother

The traumatized girl finally caves and confesses she's been faking her period, at which point her mother presents her with a Hello Flo period starter kit, presumably for when Katie does eventually reach the day she's been waiting for.

'What'd she think, I wouldn't know?' quips the mother. 'Periods don't have glitter in them.'

The ad has drawn overwhelmingly positive responses from viewers.

'I used to like marshmallows. Not anymore'

'Oh my god, this is brilliant. Why you never lie to your Mom!' comments one.

'Oh, honey. Wait till you find out this... is actually a real thing in some parts of South India. I had it. I wanted to hide my face and die,' writes another.

Even a few men chimed in, with one commenting: 'I know nothing of this particular topic, but... I actually laughed out loud. Co-workers looking at me funny and everything.'
