Britain’s only female giant panda is no longer pregnant, Edinburgh Zoo announced today.

The zoo said there is no evidence Tian Tian has had a miscarriage, and that ‘late reabsorption of the foetus’ could have taken place.

It said that all data gathered since the animal conceived in April suggested she was pregnant and likely carry to full term, but ‘sadly this did not happen’.

UK's only female giant panda: Edinburgh Zoo said there is no evidence Tian Tian has had a miscarriage

The zoo said the panda is in great health, and is being monitored by experts. Tian Tian was artificially inseminated on April 13 after she and her intended partner Yang Guang failed to mate naturally.

The zoo announced in August that she was thought to be pregnant and could give birth by the end of the month, however hopes of a cub faded when she passed her due date.

Hormone tests suggested that something might be amiss, though at the start of September the zoo said there was still a chance she could give birth to a live cub.

However, in a statement today the zoo confirmed that would not happen.

Iain Valentine, director of giant pandas for the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, said: ‘Tian Tian's hormone levels have now returned to normal, so we can confirm that she is no longer pregnant.

‘Panda reproduction and biology is 
complex; all data gathered since conception took place pointed to a 
pregnant panda likely to carry to full term, sadly this did not happen. There is no evidence she has had a miscarriage, so late reabsorption of the foetus could have occurred.

‘Although
 Tian Tian has not successfully given birth, it is important for her 
individual biology as a female giant panda and for the future of giant 
panda conservation across the globe that we tried. We will also be 
reviewing all our data and procedures from this year and last.

‘The team continue to monitor Tian Tian and she is in great health. The specialist team here and international colleagues will thoroughly review every aspect of how we care for her.’

Tian Tian (Sweetie) and Yang Guang (Sunshine) are the first giant pandas to live in the UK for 17 years.

The animals, both aged ten, arrived on loan from China in December 2011 and will remain at Edinburgh Zoo for a decade.

 Tian was successfully inseminated last year but lost her cub at late 
term. The attempt was the first artificial insemination procedure to 
take place on a giant panda in the UK.

She was again inseminated in April and the zoo confirmed in July that she had conceived but was not yet technically pregnant.

Experts
 said it would not be known for certain if she was pregnant until she 
gave birth. The zoo said that the outdoor viewing area of Tian Tian and 
Yang Guang's enclosures will be open from today.

Asked whether the zoo will try again next
 year Mr Valentine said: ‘Yes we will, first we need to make sure that 
Tian Tian and Yang Guang are in great condition, Tian Tian still needs 
to get back into a routine which will take a few months and then from 
about the shortest day we will start to monitor her again for breeding.

‘So it's only around three months until we start monitoring, and another three months until we're back into the breeding season, there's still lots of work to do but hopefully next year it will all come together.

‘There's a lot of new science we've brought to panda breeding and we've learnt a huge amount from the last two years and every time we go through this we learn more and take another step forward.

‘It will take time and absolutely it's devastating for everyone involved, it's nine months of work for a huge group, people are tired, exhausted and disappointed but we carry on.'

He added: ‘It's similar to last year only in the fact that she's lost the pregnancy.

‘What we can say is that the data from this year looks so much better in terms of timing and things to happen and it was absolutely right for two and a half weeks, whereas last year it was bouncing around a bit more frequently. The data looks quite different from last year but the result is exactly the same.’
