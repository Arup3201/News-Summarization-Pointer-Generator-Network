Ukip leader Nigel Farage promises to help the parents take legal action against Rotherham Council

A couple who had their foster children taken from them because they are members of Ukip are threatening to sue the council that removed the youngsters over alleged press leaks.

Rotherham Borough Council took the children - who are Eastern European - after discovering their foster carers were members of the UK Independence Party which was deemed a 'racist' party by social workers.

Now the experienced foster parents say they have been blacklisted and are demanding an apology.

They have said that they will now take legal action after their foster agency said the council had accused them of leaking information to the press about their children and birth parents.

They told the Guardian:  'If Rotherham Metropolitan Borough 
Council are accusing us of a breach of confidentiality and do not issue a
formal apology in order to clear our name we may be forced to seek 
legal action to protect our future as foster parents.'

Ukip has said it will back the couple's legal action.

A spokesman said:  'If that black mark isn’t removed, their chances of fostering again are very, very limited.'

He
said Ukip will 'entirely” support any law suit, adding: 'We hope it 
won’t come to that. We hope that Rotherham council will back down and do
the decent thing and apologise.'

Education Secretary Michael Gove, who ordered an investigation into the matter, has branded the decision to remove the children 'indefensible' and made 'in the wrong way for the wrong reasons'.

Rotherham council launched an urgent review when it was revealed that the children had been removed from their foster home in November.

Responding to the couple’s threat of 
legal action, a council spokesman said in a statement: 'The council is 
not and never has been the couple’s employer.

'Their future employment as foster carers is not a matter for the council, it is a matter for the agency which employs them.'

Earlier
this month the birth parents of the three children were revealed to be a
Slovakian couple who have had six of their offspring taken away by 
social workers.

The father accused council staff of ‘racism’ and of destroying his family as he told how  20 police officers ‘raided’ their home to remove their last four children.

The authorities have also taken the couple’s grandchild (the baby son of their 17-year-old married daughter), bringing the total number now being looked after by the state from this one family to seven. Their ages range from five months to 11 years.

The parents, who are happily  married
and came to Britain five years ago, found themselves at the centre of 
national controversy after the staunchly Labour council in Rotherham, South
Yorkshire, discovered that it had sent three of their removed children 
to live with the foster couple who are UKIP members.

Through
friends, the parents of the Rotherham children say the irony is that 
despite the council’s fears of the UKIP foster couple being racist, it 
is the council which has picked on them because they are Roma, and 
social workers disapprove of their non-British ‘lifestyle’.
