As some of his erstwhile England team-mates do shuttle runs dressed for winter ahead of the World Cup, John Terry is basking in the sunshine, swimming with dolphins. 

The Chelsea defender is someone the national team could really do with this summer, but Terry, who has retired from international football, won't be anywhere near Brazil when the tournament kicks off next month.

There had been calls for Roy Hodgson to attempt to lure the former skipper back, but the 33-year-old appears content at his choice to swerve international football.

All smiles: Chelsea central defender John Terry poses with a dolphin while on holiday in Florida

Diving in: Terry signed a new one-year contract at Stamford Bridge only last week

Sealing it with a kiss: Terry was on holiday and stopped off at the state's renowned Discovery Cove

Seems a touch nicer! Terry was sunning himself for pleasure while England trained in winter clothing

Meanwhile, on terra firma: Raheem Sterling grapples with Leighton Baines at England's pre-World Cup training camp in Portugal as Rickie Lambert watches on 

Terry posed for pictures with the mammals while at Discovery Cove in Florida on Wednesday at the same time England were taking a break from training in Portugal by relaxing on the golf course.

There didn't seem to be a care in the world for Terry as he had his photo taken - particularly after he penned a new one-year with Jose Mourinho at Stamford Bridge last week.

And while he has been sunning himself for pleasure, old England team-mates haven't quite been afforded the same luxury.

The climate created was more British winter than the Algarve, with players having to wear extra layers of clothing to mimic the feeling of South America.

Sports scientists from Loughborough University have flown out to take samples of the players’ sweat as they prepare for the humid conditions of Manaus, where England play Italy on June 14 in their first Group D game.

Talking tactics: Roy Hodgson talks with Sterling and gives him instructions

Shaw thing: Hodgson gives instructions to Luke Shaw during training
