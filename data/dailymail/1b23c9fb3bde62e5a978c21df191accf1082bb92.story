A gang of computer hackers is believed to have stolen tens of millions of pounds from UK banks in the largest cyber-crime ever detected.

The massive theft was part of a bold £650million raid, meticulously orchestrated over the past two years, on more than 100 financial institutions around the world.

Attacks by the gang, thought to be based in Russia but with members in Ukraine and China, are feared to be continuing, despite being investigated by Interpol and international authorities.

The computer scam was so sophisticated that the gang, known as Carbanak, was apparently able to order ATM machines to dispense cash at pre-determined times – even without a bank card. 

The cyber-criminals would pull off a raid by first gaining entry into a bank employee's computer.

They did this by sending authentic-looking emails that unsuspecting recipients then clicked on, inadvertently infecting the bank's machines with Carbanak malware – a technique known as 'spear phishing'.

Hackers were then able to infiltrate the internal network and track down administrators' computers for video surveillance.

This allowed them to see and record everything that happened on the screens of staff who serviced the cash transfer systems, which meant the fraudsters got to know and could mimic every last detail of bank clerks' work.

They used this information to impersonate bank staff online, in order to electronically transfer tens of millions of pounds from the bank into dummy accounts.

On average, each robbery took between two and four months, from infecting the first computer at the bank's corporate network to making off with the money. Another method used was where the criminals would gain access to someone's account and inflate the balance many times over before transferring the cash.

The raids, which date back to 2013, were finally detected by Russian cyber security firm Kaspersky Lab, after a Ukrainian ATM was found to be giving out notes at random times - when no one had put in a card or touched a button.

Security cameras showed how money would be picked up by customers who appeared to be in the right place at the right time.  

Kaspersky's principal security researcher Vicente Diaz said the theft was unusual as it targeted banks directly, rather than individuals' bank accounts, and that the hackers seemed to set their limit to around £10million before moving onto another bank.

'In this case they are not interested in information. They're only interested in the money,' Mr Diaz said.

'They're flexible and quite aggressive and use any tool they find useful for doing whatever they want to do.' 

A spokesman for the firm added: 'The Carbanak criminal gang used techniques drawn from the arsenal of targeted attacks. The plot marks the beginning of a new stage in the evolution of cyber-criminal activity, where malicious users steal money directly from banks, and avoid targeting end users.'

The scale of the crime was global, with banks in the US, China, Russia and Europe targeted, and the attackers thought to be expanding throughout Asia, the Middle East and Africa.

In one case, an unnamed bank lost $7.3million (around £4.7million) through ATM fraud. Another financial institution lost $10million (around £6.5million) after the attackers exploited its online banking platform.

Kaspersky has not identified the banks hit by the scam, and is still working with law-enforcement agencies to investigate the attacks, which the company says are ongoing.

Losses to UK banks have not yet been disclosed, but are thought to run into tens of millions of pounds.

However, as the scam targets institutions rather than individuals, customers' accounts have not been affected.

Despite the fact the fraud has been uncovered, it is feared that banks could be hit again, as once installed the malware can operate almost independently of the gang and is difficult to detect.

Sergey Golovanov, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, said: 'It was a very slick and professional cyber-robbery'.

Sanjay Virmani, director of the Interpol Digital Crime Centre, said: 'These attacks again underline the fact that criminals will exploit any vulnerability in any system.'

'Scale of the crime was global.'

The Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a non-profit organisation that alerts banks about hacking activity, said in a statement that its members received a briefing about the report in January.

'We cannot comment on individual actions our members have taken, but on balance we believe our members are taking appropriate actions to prevent and detect these kinds of attacks and minimize any effects on their customers,' the organisation said.

'The report that Russian banks were the primary victims of these attacks may be a significant change in targeting strategy by Russian-speaking cyber-criminals.'

US authorities are putting an increasing focus on cybersecurity in the wake of numerous data breaches of companies ranging from mass retailers like Target and Home Depot to Sony Pictures Entertainment and health insurer Anthem.

The White House wants Congress to replace the existing patchwork of state laws with a national standard giving companies 30 days to notify consumers if their personal information has been compromised.
