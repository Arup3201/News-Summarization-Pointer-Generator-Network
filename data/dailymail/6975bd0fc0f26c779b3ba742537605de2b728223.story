Tragic: Gary Windle who collapsed and died in large snow drifts just half a mile from his home in March this year

A man died from hypothermia after collapsing in large snow drifts just half a mile from his home following a night out with friends, an inquest has heard. 

Dressed in only a shirt, light jacket, trousers and shoes, Gary Windle was found by a farmer in Shay Lane, Briercliffe, buried under deep snow.

The tragedy happened on the weekend Britain experienced some of the heaviest snowfall in decades.

The 25-year-old had taken a taxi from a friend's house and was dropped near his house in Briercliffe, Lancashire, on March 23. 

But surrounding roads leading to his home were blocked because of the heavy snowfall. 

The body of Mr Windle was found later that day in a nearby field.

He was taken by air ambulance to the Royal Blackburn Hospital where he was pronounced dead. 

Giving evidence, pathologist Dr Abdul Al-Dawoud told Burnley Coroner's Court that alcohol could make a person more susceptible to hypothermia because it reduces the core temperature of the body which then leads to disorientation and poor decision making.

Recording a verdict of misadventure, Mark Williams, East Lancashire deputy coroner, said: 'It is clear he intended to walk home but unfortunately never made it.'

Speaking at the time Chief Inspector Derry Crorken described his death as a 'tragic accident' and said conditions around where Mr Windle's body were found were 'absolutely trecherous'.

Mother Julie Ashworth added: 'He was such a larger than life character and would always make us smile.

'Losing Gary in this way has left a large hole in our lives.

'He will be sorely missed to all that knew him including his family and friends. He was a true legend.'
