One of the Brooklyn Tech HS students victimized by a predatory math teacher had lingering affections for him even after he assaulted her, says her heartsick mother.

Sean Shaynak is accused of having sex with six students and allegedly sent a picture of his genitals to another 16-year-old girl in his class.

The mother, who remains anonymous as does her daughter, says Shaynak knew the naive girl had fallen for him, a trust he was happy to exploit.

In an interview with The New York Post the mother says he would give her daughter perfect grades even if she turned in unfinished work.

'I raised my children to trust people - but it looks like you can't,' she said.

Her daughter, who graduated from high school last year, is now 19, and studying criminal justice in college. 

She says her first suspicions about Shaynak's appetites came last year when she found him with several bikini-clad female students, her daughter included.

He even had his own revealing swimwear.

'The thing that surprised me was the way he laid on the beach,' she said. 'You could see...everything.'

The group was gossiping about sex, with Shaynak holding court about his taste for Russian girls, which her daughter happened to be. 

'He was talking about how beautiful Russian girls are and how sexy they are,' the mother said. 'It was scary.

'It was noticeable the way he looked at them and got excited, like he wants somebody, you could tell..' she said. 'When you see a girl and get horny - that's what he was like.' 

Her daughter later expressed that she had a crush on Shaynak.

'She said, 'Isn't he cute?' I said, 'Yes, he's cute as a man,'' the woman said. 'She said, 'I kind of like him.''

He had allegedly sodomized the girl months earlier in May. 

'The judgement for him should be high,' the woman said. 'Because it's children...and it could affect them for the rest of their life. I don't believe he will change.

'He should definitely go to prison for the rest of his life.' 

On the day after school ended in June, instructor Sean Shaynak allegedly sent the girl a picture of his privates to her cell phone via Snapchat, the girl's angered father told The New York Daily News on Thursday.

Shaynak remained in custody on Wednesday, a day after he pleaded not guilty to the new charges. Bail was set at $750,000 bond and was at $250,000 for the previous charge. Defense attorney Kimberly Summers declined to comment.

The charges in the new indictment include kidnapping, forcible touching, sexual abuse and criminal sexual act. Shaynak faces up to 25 years in prison on the top charge, authorities said.

Shaynak, 44, pleaded not guilty in August to charges including dissemination of indecent material to a minor. Authorities say he sent a photo of his genitals to a 16-year-old female student.

Authorities said on Tuesday that computers and phones taken after his arrest found text messages, photos and videos detailing sexual interactions with six teens, from ages 13 to 19, between 2011 and 2014. 

Those interactions included taking a 15-year-old girl to a nude beach and giving alcohol and cigarettes to minors, officials said.

'These alleged actions are completely unacceptable and have no place in, or outside of, our schools,' City Department of Education spokeswoman Devora Kaye said.

 'The DOE took swift action to immediately reassign Mr. Shaynak following his initial arrest. He is not, and will not be, in contact with students. Student safety remains our top priority.'

Brooklyn Tech is one of the most selective high schools in the city. 

The teacher had allegedly been trying to lure the most recent 16-year-old student who came forward with the text message into an inappropriate relationship for two years.

He was considered a 'cool teacher’ because he offered to buy her cigarettes.

The girl's father said that he also offered to take his daughter to the park and once asked her to pose for him in a project.

'He asked her to pose for him for some kind of a project, and she declined,' the furious father told The New York Daily News on Thursday.

'He wanted to take her to the park. ... We later learned he would buy her cigarettes.'

Finally when Shaynak allegedly sent the girl a picture of his crotch, she reported the incident to her parents.

The girl's father had a friend in the FBI and they immediately reached out to police.

'It was immediate outrage on my part, ‘said her father.

'You can imagine we’re all very shaken up and extremely concerned.'

The girl took the stand against the teacher two months ago and spoke before a Brooklyn grand jury.

He said that while his daughter is strong she is hurt by the incident and it has rattled her trust.

'She likes to play that she’s strong and tough ... but then she’s my little (girl) all over again asking for my help,' the dad said.

'The main concern is that this guy is off the street and that he stays behind bars and and doesn’t have any access to kids.' 

Sean Shaynak is a divorced dad-of-one who taught math and physics at Brooklyn Technical High School, which is attended by Mayor Bill de Blasio's son Dante.

During the investigation into that claim, authorities searched his home, computers and phones and allegedly unearthed thousands of inappropriate text messages, photographs and videos. 

They allegedly learned that he had had relations with six students, who ranged in age from 13 to 19, between 2011 and 2014, NBC New York reported.

'The defendant, clearly from his actions, looked to groom these students,' assistant district attorney Joseph Mancino said in Brooklyn Supreme Court, the New York Daily News reported.

He took one 15-year-old girl to a nude beach in New Jersey without her parents' permission and he also took her to his home, where he plied her with alcohol until she passed out, Mancino said.

Shaynak also asked the girl to take part in lesbian sex with another student, prosecutors claim.

During a relationship with another girl, he allegedly watched her have sex with other people at a sex club.

He also had sex with another girl but she put up resistance when the sex went too far - but he forced himself on her anyway, prosecutors said, the Daily News reported.

Shaynak also allegedly sent photos of his genitals to four students, including two minors, and gave the teenagers alcohol and cigarettes. 

He also gave the girls top grades even though they did no work, the prosecutor said. 

On Tuesday, Shaynak's lawyer Kimberly Summers pleaded not guilty on his behalf. His bail was set at $1 million.

He pleaded not guilty last month to charges including dissemination of indecent material to a minor and harassment. He was arrested on Tuesday morning on these latest claims. 

Brooklyn Tech, where Shaynak worked for five years, is based in Fort Greene and is one of the city's most selective public schools.

Dante de Blasio attends the school, but students said he was not taught by Shaynak. 

Shaynak has a nine-year-old daughter. He and his wife are divorced and she lives upstate.
