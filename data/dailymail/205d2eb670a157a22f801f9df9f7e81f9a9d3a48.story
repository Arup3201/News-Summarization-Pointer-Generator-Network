How about this for a slice of good fortune? When a woman forgot to pack her dinner she managed to avoid going hungry by dialing out for pizza.

While there is nothing unusual in that, what made this takeaway particularly unique was the fact peckish passenger Lucie Mathieson was partway through a four-hour train journey to Manchester when she picked up the phone.

And after two knock-backs, she finally managed to track down a pizza firm willing to rise to the challenge.

Slice of luck: Lucie Mathieson tucks into her tasty pizza, which was delivered to her carriage on Sunday

The 25-year-old, who is originally from Hampton Court in London, was on the 5.50pm from Port Talbot in South Wales to Manchester on Sunday, when she and two friends hatched their plan.

She said: 'We never thought it would work, but we needed some dinner. The 
train set off at 5.50pm and wasn't getting in until 10.30pm.

'I asked the train conductor when we were getting in at each station, then started calling all the pizza places on the way.

'Two said 'no', but Joe at Pizza Hut 
in Newport loved the idea. I said to him "I've got a mission for you" 
and he got very excited.'

There was just a 50 second window for Joe to deliver the piping hot pizza to the BBC set designer when their two-carriage train - which did not have a buffet car or a trolley - pulled in to Newport station.

As the train pulled in at 6.54pm, Joe was waiting for her with her dinner - one deep pan pepperoni pizza, one thin-crust chicken and mushroom, plus barbecue chicken wings and a side of garlic and herb dip.

She had handed over the 'dough' earlier when she placed the order by telephone.

It set the trio back just over Â£35, and to cap it all was delivered in exactly 30 minutes - normally the average wait for a pizza delivery is 40 minutes.

Ms Mathieson jumped onto the platform, grabbed the goodies, and was back in her seat in less than 50 seconds ready to tuck into her teatime treat.

She said: 'There were so many ways it could have gone wrong. We paid over the phone so Joe could have taken the money and not come.

Food on the go: Lucie's food was delivered an hour into her four-and-a-half-hour journey

'I don't know how he got on the station - we offered to pay for a ticket for him, but he didn't need it.

'But when he was there the whole station was cheering. By the time I got to Manchester all my friends were texting me saying I was on the front page of Reddit.

'I don't even know how I got there but everyone was posting it and commenting on it. I just can't believe we managed it.'

After posting pictures of their dinner on Facebook, Ms Mathieson and her friends became an online hit.

General manager of Newport Pizza Hut Delivery, Michelle Escott, said: 'When we got a call from a customer to deliver pizza to the Port Talbot to Manchester train we simply couldn't resist the challenge.

'The train was held at Newport station, which is in our delivery area, for less than a minute but our delivery driver got the pizzas to the train hot and bang on time.'

Back on board: Lucie proudly shows off the fruits of her labour. Two pizza firms had turned her down before Pizza Hut agreed to her request
