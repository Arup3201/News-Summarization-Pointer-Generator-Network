The crippled Fukushima nuclear plant has been given permission to build an underground 'ice wall', it has been revealed.

The wall, approved by the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA), will freeze soil around four reactors at the plant in northern Japan.

It aims to prevent radioactive water from escaping the site - as well as blocking groundwater from nearby hillsides flowing into the area.

Approved: The crippled Fukushima nuclear plant has been given permission to build an underground 'ice wall', it has been revealed. The wall will freeze soil around four reactors at the power plant in northern Japan

The project, proposed by Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO), will cost the Japanese Government an estimated 32billion Yen (£186million), according to the Japan Times.

And there will be no hanging around - with workers expected to start building the wall next month.

It comes despite concerns about the move - with the NRA previously expressing fears that the frozen wall could cause the surrounding ground to sink.

But yesterday, the agency accepted TEPCO's comment that although the ground may sink up to 16mm in some areas, it will not be significant enough to cause safety concerns.

Speaking after the approval, NRA commissioner Toyoshi Fuketa told Kyodo News: 'I think we have been able to confirm today the scale of ground 
sinking, which is what we have most feared as side effects of building 
the wall.'

But Mr Fuketa said other issues surrounding the project - including ways to measure the level of radioactive water inside the reactor buildings - are yet to be discussed.

The wall, stretching 1.5km (0.9miles) and nearly 100 feet deep, will be set up around reactors 1 to 4 at the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant, which suffered multiple meltdowns following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.

Workers will insert a line of pipes into the ground that circulate liquid as cold as -40C - causing the earth around them to freeze.

As well as preventing polluted water from escaping the plant, the wall will also block groundwater from flowing into the buildings' basements and mixing with highly radioactive water leaks from the melted cores.

Construction of the frozen wall is expected to finish in March next year, according to The Verge.

As part of the project, TEPCO is also 
installing another groundwater drainage system around the reactor 
buildings, which some experts say could serve as a sufficient 
alternative to the wall.

Earlier this month, Dale Klein, a former U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission chairman who now heads a supervisory panel for TEPCO, said he was not convinced the 'ice wall' is the best way to prevent radioactive water from escaping the plant.

He also claimed the Government and TEPCO should review the plan to balance risk and benefit to see whether they should spend the money elsewhere.

'Any time you make a decision, it should 
be based on current, relevant science, and you have to strike a balance 
between science and policy,' he said.

'At the end of the day, it may be a good alternative. But I'm just not convinced.'

More than three years after the March 2011 meltdowns, the Fukushima plant is still plagued by a massive amount of contaminated water.

Repeated water leaks from storage tanks and other mishaps have hampered a decommissioning effort that is expected to take decades.

They have also caused environmental concerns among local fishermen.
