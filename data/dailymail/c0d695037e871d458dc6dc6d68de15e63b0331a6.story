Chilling audio recordings heard by the Ferguson grand jury have been released, revealing the shots that killed Michael Brown and the police scrambling for back up as the unarmed teen lay dead in the street.

In one, a clearly shaken officer arriving on the scene just moments after the August 9 shooting urgently states,

‘We need several more units over here..there’s going to be a problem.’

A wail of anguish and weeping is audible in the background.

Shooting: Officer Darren Wilson shot Michael Brown dead in August after a confrontation between the unarmed teenager and the officer

The recordings are part of a second evidence dump promised as part of Prosecutor Bill McCulloch’s controversial decision to publicly release Grand Jury evidence without a judge’s sanction and while Federal and Department of Justice investigations into the shooting remain ongoing.

The Ferguson dispatchers repeated calls for all available units in Ferguson and St Louis County provides an audible timeline of the situation on the ground in the Missouri town where angry, mourning crowds – estimated by some to number in the hundreds – had gathered on the stretch of street where Brown’s body lay, uncovered for four hours.

The recordings filed in sequence reveal that medical services were only requested after several calls for police backup and detectives were placed. In his own testimony Wilson admitted that he made no calls for medics and no witness statement has him approaching Brown to test for any signs of life.

After the dispatcher puts out a call for ‘any available Ferguson units,’ the officer on the ground renews his request with increased urgency: ‘We’re going to need crowd control over here.’ 

Ferguson grand jury’s decision not to indict former Ferguson officer Darren Wilson, 28, for the fatal shooting this summer which saw him pump six bullets into unarmed teen was the spark that saw protests catch fire across the country.

Protest: Demonstrations have swept America under the 'hands up, don't shoot' slogan and have now embraced the 'I can't breathe' slogan prompted by the death of Eric Garner as a police officer used a chokehold while arresting him in Staten Island, New York, for selling single cigarettes.

SloganSlogan: Cleveland Cavaliers' star LeBron James warms up before an NBA basketball game against the Brooklyn Nets at the Barclays Center wearing an 'I can't breathe' t-shirt before a match watched by Prince William and Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge

Spreading: LeBron James, the Cleveland Cavaliers star became the latest sportsman to wear t-shirts with slogans inspired by the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner as he warmed up ahead of a basketball fixture watched by Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge in Brooklyn, New York.

Marching under the banner, ‘Hands up Don’t Shoot’ – taken from the widely discredited testimony of Brown’s companion that day, Dorian Johnson – protesters took to the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, St Louis and beyond. 

Five St Louis Rams players drew praise and opprobrium in equal measure when they walked onto the field with their hands held up in support of Michael Brown.

A New York grand jury’s decision not to indict Staten Island officer Daniel Pantaleo for the fatal chokehold arrest of Erica Garner was met with similar outrage by protesters in the streets of New York, Washington and cities across the States.

New York Mayor, Bill Blasio refused to endorse the Grand Jury’s decision. He described the failure to indict in the face of damning video footage and the Medical Examiner’s finding of ‘death by homicide,’ as ‘a national moment of grief..and frustration.’

Last night spectators at the basketball game attended by Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge wore ‘I can’t breathe’ T-shirts, a reference to Garner’s dying words as he begged Pantaleo to release him from his fatal hold.

Summit: New York mayor Bill de Blasio met President Obama at the White House over the escalating concerns about relations between police and the black community after the Eric Garner and Michael Brown rulings

Escalation: In Berkeley, California, there has been violence four nights in a row with police using tear gas an baton rounds against protesters.

Secret wedding: Officer Wilson married his partner Barbara Spradling shortly before the grand jury reached his decision

Pantaleo remains at work, though off patrol. Officer Wilson who had been in hiding and on paid administrative leave last week resigned from Ferguson Police Department citing as his reasons the threat to his brother officers’ safety that his continued service would bring and his hope that his action would ‘help the community heal.’

He married his partner, fellow Ferguson cop Barbara Spradling during his time in hiding and announced that they are expecting their first child in a post Grand Jury television interview.

And though he resigned without severance pay, fundraising efforts of his supporters have garnered him a potential war chest of $1million.

Brown’s family may yet bring a civil case against the officer. And while Wilson’s supporters have pointed to conflicting eye witness accounts of the shooting and insist that the officer feared for his life, MailOnline last week revealed that Wilson himself changed his story about just what happened in the crucial moments that lead to his fatal encounter with Brown.

In Wilson’s now very public account of his encounter with Michael Brown and Dorian Johnson on August 9 he has claimed that he asked Brown and Wilson to move to the sidewalk rather than walk in the street.

When they walked on, Wilson has repeatedly stated, he realized they matched the description of two suspects wanted in connection with the robbery of nearby Ferguson Market. A youth matching Brown’s description had stolen a box of Swishers cigarillos.

It was this realization, he stated, that caused him to reverse his vehicle and sparked the car-side confrontation that left Brown dead on the street with six bullets in his body.

But the sworn testimony of Wilson’s squad supervisor directly contradicts this account.

Wilson’s supervisor was the first officer to speak with the 28-year-old cop following the shooting. The men spoke before St Louis County Police had even been notified of the incident and before the medical examiner or investigating officers had arrived on the scene.

At that time, the Supervisor admitted,‘He [Wilson] did not know anything about the stealing call.’

When pressed by the attorney questioning him the officer reiterated that Wilson, ‘did not know anything.’

Asked, ‘He told you he didn’t know about there being a stealing at Ferguson Market?’

The officer responded, ‘Correct.’

Nor did he make any mention of reversing back towards the youths.

In fact the Squad Supervisor stated that, in several subsequent conversations, Wilson said ‘he did not have that call.’

The first batch of Grand Jury evidence, released on the day of their decision and reviewed by MailOnline, has revealed a litany of failures to follow protocol.

Wilson handed in and bagged his own gun in direct contradiction to recognised St Louis County procedure which demands strict guidelines in the securing and sealing of a weapon when fired by an officer with fatal consequences.

Theft: Officer Wilson's evidence that he was aware of the robbery of a store in Ferguson by Michael Brown directly contradicted what he had told his squad supervisor immediately after the shooting

The weapon was not brushed for fingerprints, key measurements were not taken at the scene, interviews were not recorded or annotated. Photographs were not taken because a battery was flat in the relevant officer’s camera.

And though Wilson claimed that he had feared for his life and that, punched twice by Brown in a tussel by his squad vehicle, he feared a third punch might kill him, medical records show him to have sustained nothing more serious that mild bruising to his jawline.
