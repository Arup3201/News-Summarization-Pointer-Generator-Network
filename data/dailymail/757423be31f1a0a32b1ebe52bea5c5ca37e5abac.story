An Australian film director's latest project has been surrounded by an eerie case of life imitating art, as it is based around a plane crash on a China-bound flight.

Alister Grierson, who is best known for his film Sanctum, is in the early stages of production for action/adventure movie Deep Water, as the air search for missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 continues.

It's not the first time one the director's films has mirrored a real life disaster, and two weeks before Sanctum's release (a film about an underwater cave diving expedition gone wrong), Australia was hit by disastrous floods.

Now Deep Water will follow the fates of passengers who survive a plane crash on a Beijing-bound flight.

The Gold Coast-based filmmaker said he couldn't deny the strange timing between his project and the real-life drama of the missing Malaysia Airlines MH3L0.

But despite saying it was 'mysterious', he insists that his film is vastly different.

He told MailOnline: 'The similarities and timing is interesting and I can see why anecdotally the two things link up, it's a tricky thing.

'But in simple terms, Deep Water is about an accident that happens on an airplane which goes down in the ocean, and the survivors trying to stay alive afterwards.

'It's more complicated than that as there's villains and sharks, but it's a fun action/adventure with thrills and spills and scares.

'Nobody knows what has happened with the Malaysian airplane. We're yet to find out whether it will be revealed as a malfunction or even found.'

Grierson and Australian production company Arclight Films began pre-production on Deep Water at Village Roadshow Studios in Queensland weeks before the real-life incident.

He said it will be some two years before the film hits cinemas, allowing enough plenty of space between the true story currently unfolding.

It's not the first time the veteran filmmaker has had life imitate art.

His first big budget feature Sanctum - executive produced by Avatar filmmaker James Cameron - was two weeks out from release when Queensland and Northern New South Wales were hit by devastating floods in 2011.

'The floods came through and destroyed whole areas, with people losing their lives,' he said.

'We had this weird situation where we were about to release a film where there's flooding and people drown.

'It was strange territory.'

Grierson said Deep Water is shaping up to be a co-production with China, who also worked with the same Australian crew on kitsch shark thriller Bait with Sharni Vinson and Julian McMahon.

'We've nicknamed it Bait 2 because there's a lot of the same crew and even themes, but it's a stand alone story.'

His next project Parer's War - about the real-life story of Australian war photographer Damien Parer - goes to air on April 27 on ABC.

Meanwhile, search planes flying deep into the Indian Ocean this weekend found nothing that could be from the missing Malaysia Airlines jet after a second day scanning the seas, Australia's acting prime minister said on Saturday.

The planes are part of an international effort to solve the nearly two-week-old mystery of what happened to flight MH370 which vanished with 239 people on board.
