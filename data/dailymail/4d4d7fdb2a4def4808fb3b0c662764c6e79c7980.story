An artist has become an online hit after turning his talents to disposable coffee cups - then leaving them behind for other customers.

Rob Draper, 40, spends up to four hours drawing intricate designs on paper cups from high street chains including Starbucks and Costa.

The graphic designer from Worcester takes some of the cups home but leaves others in the shop, where they risk being neglected or thrown away.

The designs include positive slogans such as 'R is for refill', 'Three hours of optimism' and 'Dream big'.

Mr Draper turned his skills to coffee cups after selling more permanent works through galleries.

He said he deliberately leaves the cups behind in the hope that someone will pick them up to cherish and look after.

'I have always been fascinated with the contrast of creating something of great detail on something so disposable and valueless,' he said.

'I really like the juxtaposition of the lettering itself, which I hope is beautiful, and the materials used which are disposable, everyday objects.

Message: The cups have become popular for their upbeat slogans which surprise other customers

'Since I published the project online 
they have been featured on some of the most respected style, design and 
inspiration blogs worldwide.

'The response has been phenomenal and I’m incredibly grateful of all the positive comments and feedback I receive daily from every corner of the world.

'Usually I’ll have a vague idea of a design, finish the drink and begin.

'Some I’ll take with me and return to for more elaborate designs - but some I just complete from start to finish in one sitting.'
