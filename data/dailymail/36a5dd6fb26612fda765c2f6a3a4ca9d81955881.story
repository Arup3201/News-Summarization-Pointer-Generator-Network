Partick Thistle assured their top-flight survival with a pulsating victory at Hearts.

But the pressure was further cranked up on Hibs, with Kilmarnock’s 1-0 win over St Mirren meaning Terry Butcher’s men will be plunged into a relegation play-off if they don’t beat the Ayrshire side at Easter Road on Saturday.

Although his side need only a draw to stay in the Premiership, Killie boss Allan Johnston warned they will play to win in the do-or-die clash in the capital. ‘We know we have to go out there with a similar type of performance, the same sort of tempo we played with tonight and try to get the three points,’ said Johnston, who will be without veteran midfielder James Fowler after he was harshly sent off in the dying minutes.

‘It’s hard to just play for a point. We’ve just got to go for it and try to end the season on a high.’

Ecstatics Jags boss Alan Archibald, celebrating Premiership survival a year on from his team bursting into the league, insisted their 4-2 win at Tynecastle was ‘ bigger than anything I’ve done in the game’.

‘It’s better than promotion. The relief of tension, knowing everything that’s involved, the emotion,’ said Archibald. ‘Once you’re in the league and realise what’s at stake, not just financially but the status of playing in the Premiership, you don’t want to lose it.

‘The boys all love playing in the top flight, love everything that goes with it. And, by God, you miss it when it goes.

‘I’ve been here through relegation and it’s horrible. It affects everybody at the club, everything you do, from having your lunch, to the secretarial staff. So this is massive.

‘There’s no reason why we can’t be a St Johnstone or a St Mirren, the benchmark for a club like us, an Inverness who have gone up and stayed up.’

Archibald, clearly struggling to contain his emotions at full-time, admitted: ‘I was emotional because you work hard all year, try to play the right way and do the right things to stay in the league.

‘We’ve a young and inexperienced side, which has let them down at times. But they’ve answered their critics with that second-half display. They were outstanding.

‘I’m just glad to be over the line. I don’t envy the managers still in it this Saturday, never mind the play-offs.’

Hearts boss Gary Locke said: ‘Partick certainly deserved it. They had a great second half. I can’t be too down on my lads because they’ve given me everything this season.’

Kris Boyd’s 21st goal of the season earned Killie a lifeline, but boss Johnston knows there’s much more work to be done by his battling players in Saturday’s showdown.

‘Look at the reaction we got from them tonight,’ he said. ‘They gave everything they had and more than merited the win. You could see how much it meant to the players and supporters tonight.

‘We now go into a massive game on Saturday on a bit of a high. We know it’s going to be like a cup final.’

Johnston, though, was upset with Fowler’s dismissal. ‘I thought it was really harsh. I didn’t think his first booking was a foul and the second one didn’t look like a free-kick either. It’s really disappointing to miss someone of his quality for the final game when it’s undeserved.’
