Petr Cech wants assurances over his Chelsea future as Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco manoeuvre themselves into position to strike for the goalkeeper.

The Czech Republic’s future at Stamford Bridge has been called into question following Jose Mourinho’s decision to start with Thibaut Courtois against Burnley on Monday night.

Cech feels he has been left in the dark over his first-team prospects following the return of Courtois from Atletico Madrid earlier this summer.

Dropped: Cech was replaced by Thibaut Courtois in goal for Chelsea against Burnley on Monday

And the 32-year-old wants to know what chance he has of reclaiming the No 1 spot before making a definitive decision over his future.

But with the transfer deadline just 10 days away, the urgency for answers is growing for Cech.

His omission from Monday’s starting XI was the trigger for a number of Europe’s leading clubs to ramp up their interest in Cech.

Paris St Germain and Monaco both have a concrete interest in the goalkeeper, and Chelsea are now bracing themselves for bids in the coming days.

Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti is also monitoring Cech’s situation despite signing Keylor Navas.

Chelsea are hugely reluctant to part with Cech, despite all signs pointing towards him being second choice this season.

Mourinho, despite publicly admitting continuity in the goalkeeper position is important, still feels Cech can dislodge Courtois and likes the dynamic of having two bona-fide world class keepers in his squad.

In an ideal world, Chelsea want Cech to stay and fight for his place, but the goalkeeper is unlikely to accept a season of sitting on the bench.

A loan move with away from Stamford Bridge with a recall option could suit both Chelsea and Cech.

Meanwhile, Courtois insists he wants Cech to stay at Chelsea.

‘Do I want Cech to stay? Of course, in training I can still learn from him because he has a lot of experience, he can give me good tips about the Premier League, things I might not know from the start.

‘For the team is better for us to have two good goalkeepers. I don’t have a problem if he stays. Hopefully I can play well and stay in the team.

He added: ‘The manager told me an hour before the game. It was nice because I came here obviously to play. ‘But I know that Petr is a great goalkeeper so there is a lot competition, but when you come back from a successful loan you hope to play.

‘Otherwise, it would maybe have been better for me to go to another team.’
