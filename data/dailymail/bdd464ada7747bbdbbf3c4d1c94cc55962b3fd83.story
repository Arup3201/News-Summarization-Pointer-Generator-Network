The devastating fire that engulfed part of a Jersey shore boardwalk and dozens of businesses was caused by wiring that was damaged by Hurricane Sandy.

The Seaside Park, New Jersey boardwalk emerged relatively unscathed from the October 29 storm compared to its neighbor Seaside Heights. But Sandy left her indelible mark after all, last Thursday when a raging fire blazed through 80 buildings across three blocks of the resort town.

The fire began at a frozen custard stand, where aged wiring that had been compromised by salt water and sand sparked what would eventually become an inferno, federal and county investigators said at a Tuesday news conference.

Still damaging: Authorities said Tuesday that the massive boardwalk fire was accidental and linked it to electrical wiring and equipment that was compromised by Superstorm Sandy

The wind-whipped blaze destroyed more than 50 businesses in the two towns.

Ocean County Prosecutor Joseph Coronato said the fire should be a cautionary tale and prompt coastal property owners to inspect their own equipment for similar danger.

‘I'm sure on every boardwalk everywhere (at the Jersey shore), there may be compromised wiring,’ he said. ‘We don't want to start a panic mode. We just want to be reasonable. If you're a property owner and you think your electrical work came in contact with water and sand, we strongly recommend you have it inspected.’

Seaside Heights officials did not immediately return a message seeking comment about the status of wiring in the surviving two-thirds of the boardwalk.

No work today: Several employees of Kohrs Frozen Custard viewed the remaining ashes of Funtown Pier at Seaside Park boardwalk. The fire was started by faulty wiring in the custard shop last Thursday

Aftermath: The sign for Funtown Pier stands above charred rubble in Seaside Park, New Jersey after the devastating fire last Thursday ripped through the resort town and destroyed some 80 buildings

Depressing: The area was hard hit by Hurricane Sandy, though this particular boardwalk had until now avoided the devastation the storm wreaked on other areas

Investigators said the fire began in wiring that dated to the 1970s and was located under a frozen custard stand and candy shop.

Jessica Gotthold, a senior special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said investigators located wires under the boardwalk that somehow came in contact with each other, causing an electrical arc that is believed to have started the fire. Coronato said those wires had been exposed to the storm surge and grating sand action of the storm, which compromised them.

But as far as why the wires contacted each other, he said, ‘we will never know.’The prosecutor said the investigation ruled out all other possible causes of the fire, including careless smoking or a deliberate act of arson. The wiring was inaccessible to the public, he noted.Authorities even pulled financial records of the businesses involved in the blaze to make sure no one had a financial motive to start a fire.

Inferno: Firefighters are seen pulling back Thursday afternoon during the height of the inferno, which at one point became too hot to approach

Catching a break: A 25-foot fire break was smashed into the boardwalk near where Seaside Park meets Seaside Heights, largely sparing the neighboring town from the fire that ravaged Seaside Park

Can't get a break: Seaside Heights got its facelift just days before beach season began but now a black, burnt scar will mar its close neighbor Seaside Park

After Sandy: Workers replace the boardwalk in Seaside Heights destroyed by the superstorm in 2012. Unlike its neighbor, Seaside Park's adjoining boardwalk was untouched by the storm. Now, it is Seaside Park's turn to suffer

‘We left no stone unturned,’ he said. ‘This was not a suspicious fire.’

It
was only by destroying part of the 5-month-old boardwalk that Seaside 
Heights had just spent $8 million to rebuild that the rest of the 
walkway was saved. Public works crews ripped out a 25-foot swath of 
boardwalk to serve as a makeshift fire break, depriving the blaze of 
fuel. They then filled the void with giant sand piles — makeshift dunes 
to hold back fire, not water.

The desperation plan worked and stopped the fire from burning the rest of the boardwalk.Gov.
Chris Christie's administration decided the state will use 
Sandy-recovery money to pay for debris removal. He also pledged $15 
million in Sandy money to help rebuild the burned businesses.

Christie
said Tuesday the state will let business affected by the fire postpone 
filing sales and use tax returns that were due this month until October 
to help them recover.
