Nick Clegg last night risked civil war in his party as he insisted Lord Rennard should not rejoin the Lib Dem group in the Lords unless he apologises over sexual harassment allegations.

It came as a former party activist, who claims to have been the victim of ‘scary’ unwanted advances after Lord Rennard trapped her in a room, attacked the party for letting him get off scot-free.

Party leader Mr Clegg’s comments came after he was warned that he would face a rebellion by Lib Dem peers if he tried to remove the party whip from Lord Rennard.

Under party rules, peers would have to ratify any such decision. Peers are due to meet on Monday when Lord Rennard is expected to be welcomed back into the fold. 

And Mr Clegg was placed under further pressure last night after more than 100 Lib Dem activists signed a letter urging him to demand the withdrawal of the whip from Lord Rennard if he fails to apologise.

The letter’s signatories include the party’s youth wing, Liberal Youth, former parliamentary candidates and local councillors.

Last night, a Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘Nick Clegg is of the view that, as long as Lord Rennard refuses the very reasonable request from Alistair Webster QC to apologise, that it is inappropriate for him to rejoin the Liberal Democrat group in the House of Lords.

'Nick has communicated this to the Chief Whip and Leader of the House of Lords group.’

This week Lord Rennard escaped punishment over the sexual harassment claims, despite the party’s inquiry finding the evidence against him was ‘credible’.

The former Lib Dem chief executive was told to apologise to the women who had complained. But in a humiliating blow to Mr Clegg, he refused to say sorry.

Alleged victim Alison Smith said the party had carried out a secretive inquiry which had failed to properly investigate whether the peer had brought the Lib Dems into disrepute, leaving no one satisfied. Another alleged victim, Alison Goldsworthy, described the result of the investigation as ‘deeply depressing’. 

She said: ‘The party has found itself sitting in an absurd no man’s land where it is unable to install a sanction against Chris Rennard but instead can ask him to apologise to us. Something he very clearly has no plans to do...We should look to Nick Clegg to firm up his position and show some of his moral courage. That would involve an ultimatum.’

And a third alleged victim, Lib Dem parliamentary candidate Susan Gaszczak, told the party leadership to ‘man up’ and take action over Lord Rennard.

Yesterday Miss Smith told BBC Radio 2’s Jeremy Vine Show that she had made complaints about Lord Rennard’s ‘inappropriate behaviour’ on two occasions, five years apart.

The first was in 2002 when she was ‘very young, very green and new to the Lib Dems’.

It made her feel ‘very uncomfortable’ but at that time he accepted that she had said no. ‘I asked around and people said, “Oh yes stay away from Lord Rennard – he has a bit of a reputation as a lech”. But it’s easier said than done; it’s a workplace.’

Five years later he made advances again but she said ‘the problem this time is that he really did not want to take no for an answer’. She said he touched her intimately.

She added: ‘I felt trapped in that room. He said I couldn’t leave – it actually turned out to be quite a scary experience. I had to raise my voice and threaten to call the police.

‘It’s one thing to be working with someone who’s a bit of a lech, it’s another thing if you’re actually feeling your safety is under threat.’

She said she did not immediately go to the police because, having a law degree, she knew the police would not see it as a criminal matter.

She went on to criticise the Lib Dem investigation.

She said: ‘It satisfied nobody... They’ve failed completely to look at this issue of whether he brought the party into disrepute or not.

‘I’m absolutely with people who complain about the secrecy of the whole thing. There has to be a due process, it has to be at least some degree of transparency.’
