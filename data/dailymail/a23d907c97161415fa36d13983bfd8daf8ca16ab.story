A homeowner was recovering in hospital today after his airbed exploded with such force it shattered roof tiles and blew out windows.

Kenny McAdam was rushed to hospital following the blast, which sparked fears among neighbours there had been a gas explosion.

Emergency services were called to the flat Mr McAdam, 53, shares with his partner Lynn, 49, after the street was showered with debris from the explosion.

Debris: The airbed exploded with such force neighbours feared there had been a gas blast

Mr McAdam had been inflating an airbed when it exploded at the home in Alexandria, West Dunbartonshire, Scotland, yesterday.

It is believed the blast was caused by a fault with the bed’s built-in compressor.

Neighbour Wendy Morrison, 41, who lives in the ground floor flat below, said: 'It was utter chaos.

'All of a sudden there was a massive explosion. The whole building shook and they felt it 100 yards further down the road.

'There were a couple of bangs after that. I made sure all my cats and dogs were in the house and ran out. I thought it was a gas explosion.

'All the windows of his flat were blown out and there was glass everywhere. Half of the roof was blown off.

'The police and fire service arrived and told me I wouldn’t be allowed back into my house.

'Kenny was taken away in an ambulance. He didn’t look too good but I think he was just in shock.

'He owns all the roof space and they converted it into bedrooms but I’m not sure where the airbed exploded.

'Luckily I don’t have much damage but they are going to do a survey to check for structural damage. I’m still in shock.'

Mr McAdam, who was described as 'walking wounded', was taken to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley as a precaution as the Scottish Fire Service and building control officers began their investigation.

Police officers, who closed off the street and diverted traffic, described the blast as a 'household accident'.

A Police Scotland spokesman said: 'It is understood a blow-up airbed exploded. The airbed had a fault and the built-in compressor has burst and exploded.

'A man was taken to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley.'

The spokesman said the street was closed to traffic as a precautionary measure.

A Scottish Fire Service spokeswoman added: 'Crews were originally called out to reports of a house fire in Alexandria.

'However, upon arrival crews established that some kind of explosion had taken place.

'The incident had caused significant damage to the building, including windows being blown out.

'Firefighters requested assistance from building control and a fire investigation team were called out to the site.'
