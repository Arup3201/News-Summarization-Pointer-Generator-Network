A group of schoolchildren had to be evacuated from their burning school bus when it caught fire on a busy road during rush hour. 

Fifteen secondary school pupils were rushed off the vehicle when its driver realised there were flames coming from its rear wheel. 

No one was hurt in the incident, with fire fighters called to the scene in Radlett, Hertfordshire, as rush hour traffic piled up. 

Fifteen schoolchildren were evacuated from the bus when it caught fire on its way to a secondary school in Barnet, north London 

The blaze was put out within half an hour after witnesses shared photographs of black smoke filtering through the sky from miles away. 

The man driving the bus, which belonged to Little Bus Company, has been praised for safely getting the children out in time. 

'The driver was brilliant, he did exactly what he should and everyone is safe,' said the company's director, Jeremy Reese. 

'As soon as it was noticed, the driver stopped, got everyone off incredibly quickly and we’re very glad no-one was hurt.

'A parent was following the coach and said she couldn’t believe how quickly he acted.' 

The bus was taking children to a school in Barnet, north London, when the incident occurred.

A Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue spokesman said: 'We were called at 7.27am to one coach that was well alight on the roadway.

'Two engines attended, fire fighters used two hose reel jets to control the fire. The fire was put out by 7.56am with the cause being given as accidental.' 

The road was closed however for almost three hours after damage caused by the flames. 

Emergency services said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the incident.   

Photographs taken near the scene show black smoke coming from the vehicle at rush hour this morning 

Watling Street in Radlett, Hertfordshire, was closed for around three hours after damage was done to the road (pictured above)
