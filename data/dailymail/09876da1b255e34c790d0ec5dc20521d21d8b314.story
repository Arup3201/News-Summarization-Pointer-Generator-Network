Physically unimposing but allergic to giving the ball away, Xavi Hernandez will go down as Spain's greatest ever player, the man who best represented a generation that won three major international trophies back-to-back, and rivaled the Brazil 1970 side for the accolade of ‘best ever’.

He was in Vienna in 2008 when Spain ended its 44-year wait for a trophy winning the Euros, he was in Johannesburg two years later as they became World Champions, and in Kiev in 2012 as they completed the hat-trick.

He was also in Nigeria in 1999 alongside Iker Casillas as the seeds of senior success were sown with an Under-20 World Cup triumph. Spain’s golden era started with his emergence and in Brazil it appeared to have ended with his demise.

Left out of the third group game against
 Australia his last two matches were a 2-0 defeat to Chile and a 5-1 
reverse against Louis van Gaal’s Netherlands. But those losses will be 
forgotten long before the victories in Austria, South Africa and 
Ukraine.

Spain were terminal big-tournament failures in 2008 – a different hard luck story every two years – and Luis Aragones was an unpopular coach going into the tournament having ousted Real Madrid legend Raul and handed leadership responsibilities to Barcelona midfielder Xavi.

The pay-back came throughout the tournament but none more so than in the final when his clever lofted pass over the German defence on the half hour put Fernando Torres through to beat Jens Lehmann for the only goal of the game.

At 28-years of age that might have been the peak for Xavi but he was only just getting started. Two years later he swaggered through the World Cup picking holes in the rival defences that now tended to line up eight-men deep against the Spanish.

He got his hands on the World Cup after Andres Iniesta scored the winner against the Dutch and would stand alongside him a few month later on the Ballon d’Or podium. Many Spain fans still see it as an injustice that he finished third and not first in the voting.

In the European Championship two years 
later there were signs that the old midfield metronome was staring to 
lose time but he kept his place all the way to the final and produced 
one of his best ever performances in Spain’s perfect 4-0 victory over 
Italy.

It’s not just his football that will be missed from the international stage – a willingness to talk about the beautiful game has always made him stand out from his contemporaries. He was interviewed by Sportsmail in 2011 and engaged for over an hour on the differences between the English and the Spanish game displaying all the intelligence off the pitch that he has shown for, first Aragones and then Vicente del Bosque, on it.

For such an important player he also managed to remain understated in the most dramatic of circumstances. In the World Cup semi-final against Germany in 2010 with just two minutes left the match referee asked him if he could have his shirt after the game. 'If you blow the whistle a minute early it’s yours,' was his reply.

There were times when his willingness to talk football upset some who found Spain’s domination tiresome. He was fond of talking about his team’s ‘superiority’ on the pitch though more often that not that meant numerical superiority, with so much of their success due to always having the extra man in all areas of the pitch.

And Xavi was so often that extra man, appearing for a team-mate receiving and then moving the ball on. ‘I get the ball, I give the ball, I get the ball, I give the ball’ as his club coach at Barcelona, Pep Guardiola, once put it.

At the 2010 World Cup he played 599 accurate passes with a 91 per cent success rate. It will be a long time before that kind of relentless domination of possession is seen again. And before anyone plays such a big part in three straight tournament victories.
