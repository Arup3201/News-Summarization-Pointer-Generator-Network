NHS patients will soon be treated by science graduates who have completed just two years of training.

Under plans to relieve pressure on the Health Service, the ‘physician associates’ will work in local surgeries and casualty wards.

While it can take doctors seven years to qualify, the associates will have just two years of intensive training and will not be registered with the General Medical Council or any other body.

NHS patients will soon be treated by science graduates who have completed just two years of training. Under plans to relieve pressure on the Health Service, the 'physician associates' will work in local surgeries and casualty wards

They will carry out many of the same tasks as junior doctors, including examining patients, ordering and interpreting tests, admitting and discharging people to hospital and deciding on treatment.

They will not be able to prescribe drugs but will prepare prescriptions for qualified doctors to sign off. Their employers may demand that they enrol on a voluntary register. The Government hopes that establishing a new profession – between nurses and doctors – will be a cheaper way of helping the NHS cope with rising demand from an ageing population.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said last night: ‘The NHS is treating record numbers of people.

‘That’s why we are growing the workforce further with a new class of medic so busy doctors have more time to care for patients.

‘I hope this will give a generation of talented graduates a gateway into medicine so they can contribute to our world-leading NHS.’

Two hundred associates are already working in the UK after the post was launched in 2003. Three training courses – in Aberdeen, Birmingham and London – together offer 105 places. This is set to double to around 225 between September and January as new courses open in Plymouth, Wolverhampton and Worcester. Birmingham’s course will expand.

Four more courses are planned by autumn 2015 to increase the numbers further.

The Department of Health says associates have been a ‘huge success’ in the United States where there are more than 80,000.

But there are some concerns that NHS managers might be tempted to cut costs by hiring physician associates who earn a salary of around £30,000 to £40,000 instead of regular doctors who are paid more than double that.

Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, told The Times: ‘We are concerned that, as physician assistants are cheaper to recruit and pay, hospitals managers may become reliant upon them to bring up staff numbers on their wards.

‘We have previously expressed our concern about the use of healthcare assistants in place of registered nurses, and it would appear that the medical profession is now heading down a similar path.’

Roger Goss of Patient Concern said: ‘We can be certain that some people in management will introduce the system as intended but you can guarantee that others will see this as a glorious opportunity to cut costs.’

Around 50 per cent of the associates will be on the frontline. As well as science graduates some will have previously trained as nurses,  physiotherapists or paramedics.

The Department of Health says physician associates have very high rates of staying in the job, and have the support of a doctor at all times.

Around 95 per cent of those who qualified as physician associates in the UK are still working here.
