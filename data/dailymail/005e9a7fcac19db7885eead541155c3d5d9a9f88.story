Drug mule Melissa Reid’s prison sentence for smuggling cocaine is too harsh, her parents claimed last night, as they revealed their fears that she will spend the best years of her life behind bars.

Melissa and fellow mule Michaella McCollum Connolly were last week jailed for six years eight months – the minimum term – after being caught trying to smuggle £1.5 million of cocaine out of Peru in August.

The Mail on Sunday understands the British women are not eligible for a sentence reduction, meaning they will serve the full term.

Melissa’s father, Billy, 53, said:  ‘We think the sentence is too harsh and doesn’t sit with the crime. ‘They’re first-time offenders and they didn’t instigate it.

'The other people involved – the bigger players – must be watching all this. They must still not be able to sleep easy at night.’

The family are not appealing against the decision and are clinging to hopes that Melissa may one day be transferred back to the UK to serve part of her sentence.

Mr Reid, from Lenzie, near Glasgow, added: ‘This stigmatises Melissa for the rest of her life.  She’s always going to be known as the drug mule. We’re the drug mule’s father and mother. That’s what it will be for ever more.

‘Melissa lost two grandparents this year before all this happened. She’s got two elderly grandparents now  – personally, I don’t think she’ll  ever see them again.’

Melissa, 20, revealed her torment in an emotional phone call to her mother, Debbie, the morning after she was sentenced. She told her: ‘I really don’t think it has sunk in yet. I wish you and Dad had been there.’

Breaking down in tears, she added: ‘I’m just frightened about what’s going to happen next. It’s such a long time. At least I’ve got Michaella here with me.’

Melissa and Michaella, from Dungannon in Northern Ireland, were arrested trying to board a plane bound for Spain with 11kg of cocaine in their suitcases.

They originally claimed to have been kidnapped  by a gang in Ibiza and forced to travel to Peru, but later accepted responsibility and pleaded guilty.

Mr Reid said: ‘I thought it might bring some kind of closure but it’s just opened up more issues and brought uncertainty. How long do they actually have to serve in Peru? When can they be transferred to a UK prison? We’ve been told different things by different people.’

Mrs Reid, 53, added: ‘When you think of six years eight months, Melissa is going to be 27 before the sentence is complete.

‘Those years she’ll miss are supposed to be the time of your life. It’s when you settle down and meet your partner, have fun with friends.

‘I’m trying to think she will still be a young woman when she’s released and those things will happen for  her but it’s such a long time. We’re hoping that she’ll be out sooner.’
