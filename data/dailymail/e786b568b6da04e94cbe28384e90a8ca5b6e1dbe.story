This is the jaw-dropping moment an international footballer caused £200,000 damage after losing control of his Porsche 911 and crashing into a petrol station shop.

Jonathan Legear, 25, ploughed into the forecourt and through the windows of the shop in Tongeren, Belgium, knocking over more than 1,000 cans of drink and hitting a customer.

Miraculously, bystander Jeffrey Dewallef only twisted an ankle while jumping out of the way of the Belgian footballer's £80,000 car.

Out of control: The Belgian midfielder smashed into a scooter and knocked over more than 1,000 drinks as his £80,000 car careered into the petrol station

Previous form: The Belgian, who has been banned from driving for two weeks, lost control of a BMW in 2009 and crashed into a house

Legear, who plays for Terek Grozny in 
the Russian Premier League, is seen on CCTV smashing into a scooter as 
he narrowly avoids colliding with other  customers inside the store.

The Belgian, from Liege, is expected to be charged with involuntary assault and possibly intoxication following the dramatic incident on Sunday at around 5.30am.

He has been banned from driving for two weeks and could face a prison spell, according to reports in his homeland.

The midfielder, who previously played for Anderlecht and Standard Liege, apologised for the incident but denied he was drunk at the time of the crash.

'I am thinking 
particularly of those present at the time of the accident and those who 
could be affected at any level,' he said in a statement.

'Dangerous driving': The midfielder looks set to be charged with involuntary assault and intoxication

'I have already asked by advisors to contact them. I accept the consequences of the accident under the law.

'Contrary to the judgment already made 
by some media, I was not in a state of deep intoxication and my blood 
alcohol level was only slightly above the legal limit.'

An Esso spokesperson added: 'The pump 
automisation has been destroyed. We estimate the amount of damage 
between 250,000 and 300,000 euros.'

Incredibly, it is not the first time Legear has lost control of a car and crashed into a building. In 2009 he smashed his BMW into a house.

Court spokesman Michel Zegers said yesterday that there is no reason to prevent Legear from rejoining Grozny ‘as long as he does not drive there himself.’
