Support for Nigel Farage's UKIP has grown from 4.5 per cent to 15 per cent in a year

Support for the UK Independence Party (Ukip) has reached a new high of 15 per cent, up from 4.5 per cent last year, according to a new poll.

The anti-EU, right-wing populist party's rating has risen by another percentage point in the past fortnight as its fortunes continue to rise, the Opinium survey for The Observer found.

The party believes in the right of the people of the UK to govern themselves, 'rather than be governed by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels.'

Its support is almost double that for the Liberal Democrats, languishing in the same poll on 8 per cent.

Labour were on 39 per cent with a 10-point lead over the Conservatives on 29 per cent.

All three main parties were unchanged from a fortnight ago.

Opinium interviewed 1,965 British adults between December 21 and 27.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage said yesterday that 2012 had been a 'remarkable year' for the party, which has seen its ratings rise from 4.5 per cent just 12 months ago and 'become ragared as a mainstream political party'.

In a New Year message, he said Ukip's performances in a series of by-elections demonstrated that it was taking votes from Labour as well as the Tories.

'I'm particularly pleased to think back to the by-elections, especially the ones we had in Corby, Rotherham, and Middlesbrough,' he said.

'What it showed was that despite the media obsession that Ukip is taking Tory votes - which of course we are - what those Northern constituencies showed is that Labour votes are coming to Ukip in real numbers too.'

He also expressed delight at bringing the party's 'key campaigning issues to the centre of a national debate in this country.'

Labour MP Jon Cruddas, who is chairing his party's policy review for leader Ed Miliband, predicted that Ukip would have 'a great 2013 and an even better 2014' when they could win the European elections.

In an article for the Sunday People, he said: 'My hunch is that he (Nigel Farage) and Ukip will have a great 2013 and an even better 2014 when they may top the European elections,' he said.

'For me politics was always about us (Labour) and them (Tories). Two teams, camps, gangs, crews, tribes - call them what you will - but basically left and right. I have never got the Liberals.

'But 2013 will be the breakthrough year of four-party politics - with Ukip the big winners.'

Britain's relationship with the EU has been a bone of contention in recent months.

Cameron is due within weeks to indicate that after the next general election he would be prepared to hold a referendum on a new EU settlement.

A key architect of the European project, Jacques Delor, suggested on Fridat that the UK could be an EU 'partner' rather than a fully fledged 
member of an organisation committed to ever-closer union.

Mr Delors said: 'If the British do not follow the tendency towards more 
integration in the European Union, we can anyway stay friends, but in 
another way.'

He suggested the UK might sign up for an arrangement 'like that of the 
European Economic Area' or a 'free trade agreement'.
