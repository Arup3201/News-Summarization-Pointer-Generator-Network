Manchester United have recalled Reece James from his loan spell at Rotherham United amid interest from Premier League and Championship clubs.

The 21-year-old has impressed under Steve Evans at the New York Stadium where he has played eight games since joining on an emergency loan at the end of November.

However, his form has alerted other clubs who are looking to strengthen their defence in the January window.

Evans said: 'He is an outstanding young left back or indeed can be utilised further forward as and when needed.'

James had a successful pre-season with United on their US tour, notably scoring twice against LA Galaxy, and excited coach Louis van Gaal, but he has been pushed down the pecking order after injury and the subsequent return of England international Luke Shaw.

He is out of contract in the summer and is now considering his options with the next step an important one in his career.

Norwegian side Sandefjord have opened the door for controversial striker Ched Evans to join them - although the Ministry of Justice have said it would be 'difficult or impossible' for him to play abroad, unless he is successful in the appeal against his conviction. This is due to the terms of his licence, which state Evans needs to meet regularly with their offender manager which would be difficult to do abroad..

The convicted rapist is struggling to get a club in England as the adverse publicity and public reaction puts off clubs and sponsors alike.

However, former Nottingham Forest and Derby County midfielder Lars Bohinen is manager of Sandefjord and has confirmed he would give Evans a chance.

Bohinen said: 'I believe that when you have served your sentence, then a person should not be punished anymore. You should not be charged for it later.

'Yes, I would not have any problems [signing Evans if he performed during a trial]. It would be terrible if we would not let convicted people get back into the workforce.'

Talking to Dagbladet, he added: 'In theory, there should not be any issue with the club's sponsors. But the mechanism of football is such that you can quickly become influenced by sponsors today.

'It will cost society more should convicts not go back to a job. If you have you made a mistake there should not be any obstacle [to returning to work].'

Roma are weighing up an offer for Tottenham Hotspur striker Emmanuel Adebayor.

Coach Rudi Garcia is looking for alternatives as striker Mattia Destro is in talks with various clubs but particularly AC Milan.

Tottenham have potential targets in the shape of Burnley's Danny Ings and Carlos Bacca at Sevilla should Adebayor go.

They are awaiting bids for Aaron Lennon from Everton, Stoke City and West Bromwich Albion.

Spurs also expect more talks with Juventus over Paulinho and offers for captain Younes Kaboul but most of their incomings are being considered for summer.

Chelsea winger Mohamed Salah is wanted on loan by Bundesliga side Hamburg but the Egyptian is holding out for a better move.

It is understood he has also been offered to Fiorentina, who want to send back Marko Marin and are trying to offload big-earner Mario Gomez in the process, but the Italians have other priorities.

Marin is wanted on loan at Wolfsburg, who could look to make the move permanent.

Fiorentina are also looking to offload former Liverpool midfielder Alberto Aquilani. The 30-year-old playmaker is available on a free transfer.

Meanwhile, Chelsea youngster Nathaniel Chalobah's proposed loan move to Bordeaux has broken down. Similar to the position of Hatem Ben Arfa, Chalobah had already played Chelsea's Under 21 side, which counts as an official match before going on loan to Burnley.

Therefore Bordeaux would be the third, which is against FIFA regulations. The breakdown of the move has been confirmed by Bordeaux president Jean-Louis Triaud.

Ben Arfa's case is the subject of an emergency meeting called by France's Legal Affairs Committee of the LFP (Professional Football League) on Thursday afternoon.

Lille have had an offer rejected for Ajax’s Icelandic forward Kolbeinn Sigthorsson. The deal is of significance in the Premier League as, should it go through, it would allow Liverpool to bring forward the signing of Divock Origi from Lille.

That would then trigger West Bromwich Albion and Crystal Palace to renew interest in Rickie Lambert.

Lille, who are also pursuing Benfica’s Derley, have offered around £4million for Sigthorsson, who was a target for Queens Park Rangers before their budget was slashed.

Stoke City defender Robert Huth is a target for Fulham and Watford.

West Bromwich Albion have been mentioned but manager Tony Pulis is reluctant to go back for players from his former club.

Fulham boss Kit Symons wants experience to aid the youngsters in his side as they look to jump up the Championship table.

West Brom are also among clubs considering a £4m bid for Lokomotiv Moscow's Vedran Corluka.

Brighton & Hove Albion are showing interest in Tranmere Rovers midfielder Max Power after he turned down the offer of a new contract.

Power has been at Tranmere since the age of eight but is out of contract in the summer and has drawn attention from various clubs with some eye-catching performances and 10 goals this season, including one against Swansea City in the FA Cup.

Celtic, Rangers, Burnley and Sheffield Wednesday have all sent scouts to watch him but Brighton are now also in the race for his signature. Tranmere could sell in this window or take the option of compensation when the 21-year-old leaves in the summer.
