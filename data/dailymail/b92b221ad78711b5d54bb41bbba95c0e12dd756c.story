It's a Saturday night in Sisaket, a small town in Thailand's Isan province, and huge crowds have gathered around a makeshift boxing ring ahead of the big fight.

But the two promising fighters about to take to the ring aren't your average boxers: Instead, they're an 11-year-old boy named Nat Thanarak and his opposition - a 12-year-old called Nong Em.

Muay Thai is one of the toughest martial arts in the world and children as young as seven are paid to compete in vicious bouts that attract bets which run into thousands of baht.

Thailand has an estimated 30,000 child boxers but the impact of beginning a fighting career so young can be severe, with brain damage comparable to that seen in car accident victims and early onset dementia among the risks.

Despite the risks, it is not illegal for children to fight provided they have their parents permission. But although young fighters are supposed to wear padded clothing, in practice, they rarely do.

Even if it means the chance of serious injury to their children, in poverty-stricken regions such as Isan, the lure of prize money can prove too much to resist - with or without pads.

One such fighter is Nat Thanarak, a boy from a poor family whose main source of income is the pittance his mother, a nanny working in Bangkok, sends them each month.

The money he makes is the difference between eating and starving and so, the little boy lives a life that involves four hours of training each day, a strict diet and little time for play.

'I do it because I get money,' he explains in his childish treble. Asked what he'd do should he manage to win one of the more lucrative fights staged in Bangkok, he replies: 'Buy a motorbike!'

Fighter: Nat Thanarak and his father Watchara who says he worries about what might happen to his son

His 
upcoming fight with Nong Em is an important one and has attracted huge 
bets, including a 50,000 baht (£1,000) flutter raised by his village - a
 vast amount in Thailand, where £1,000 is more than the average person 
earns in a year.

But
 to win it, he needs to weigh 25kg and is currently 3kg overweight. As a
 result, his father Watchara has cranked up his regime, which already involves 
push-ups, lifting oil cans and building up his neck muscles courtesy of a
 chunk of concrete attached to his hat.

'This is the most important fight of his career,' explains Mr Thanarak. 'But he needs to lose three kilos before he can fight.'

His solution is drastic. Daily 8km runs in 30 degree heat, all while sporting a sweat suit in a bid to get rid of excess water and help him lose weight.

Despite the dangers, unemployed Mr Thanarak says he has no choice. 'Sometimes we can't make ends meet,' he explains. 'We are broke and have to borrow money.

'If he didn't fight, I would go to work in Bangkok with my wife and send
 money back to my kids,' he continues.

'Sometimes Nat realises how much is riding on his boxing but sometimes he doesn't 
because he's too young. He wants to play - he misses his friends.'

But not being able to play is the least of Nat's concerns. As researchers at Bangkok's Ramathibodi Hospital have revealed, the child risks far more than limited playtime.

'Their brains are still growing,' explains Professor Jiraporn Laothamatas. 'When you do damage to a child, it's much more severe than in an adult.

Brutal: Children taking part in Muay Thai bouts can kick and elbow their way to victory as well as punch

Known as 'the art of eight limbs' Muay Thai involves using the arms, shins, fists and feet to overcome opponents.

Invented in Thailand, the sport became widely popular after being incorporated into military training by King Naresuan in 1560.

Until recently, bonds made from knotted rope were used to protect the knuckles and damage the opposing fighter but after several deaths, they were exchanged for padded gloves in the 1990s.

'There
 might be some lower intelligence level compared to normal standard 
kids. Some dementia might happen. Some don't think well, don't feel well
 but they don't know how to tell what's different to them.'

Mr Thanarak is not unaware of the risks and says he does worry about the risk of brain injury. 'I am worried about damage to his brain 
but my son loves boxing,' he says.

'He wants to fight. I told him to stop after the
 last fight. He refused. If he doesn't fight, our money will go 
down and that's a problem because the money is supporting our family.

'The fact is, I don't want him to fight. He's still so young.'

For his own part, Nat says he wants to carry on. 'I will continue training,' he insists. 'It makes me strong and it will make my village famous.'

It might also leave him with brain damage but for now, little Nat and thousands like him will continue to risk life and limb in the boxing ring.
