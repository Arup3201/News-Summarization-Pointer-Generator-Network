The 'egalitarian' low cost airline JetBlue has unveiled a business class section on its new planes that includes private mini-suites.

In a business class cabin of 16 seats, 
four are mini-suites featuring sliding doors for privacy and spacious 
chairs which convert to flat massage beds.

It is the first time the airline has introduced a premium class section onto any of its planes since its launch 13 years ago.

Market gap: JetBlue is hoping to offer its premium seats cheaper than its high-end competitors to tempt small business owners

The12 other seats in the private cabin do not have the privacy doors, but do have the lie-flat beds, as well as a 15inch touchscreen television with 100 channels, WiFi and power and USB sockets.

Passengers will get hot meals, alcoholic drinks and toiletries included in the ticket price, which has not yet been revealed.

The seats will be introduced onto 11 of its 30 new Airbus A321 planes between New York and Los Angeles, and New York and San Francisco in spring 2014.

A return ticket for a cross-country flight with JetBlue is currently around $680, while its premium-class competitors can charge around $4,000.Â

Divide: The introduction of the private business section is the first time JetBlue has had class separation on its planes

Executives at the airline told the Wall Street Journal that the ticket price for its business seats would be a 'significant reduction' in comparison with its high-end competitors.

Robin Hayes, an executive vice president at JetBlue, told the newspaper that some of its 
passengers wanted 'a better experience than the coach experience when 
flying across the country. It's not a market JetBlue serves today.'

While JetBlue CEO told Apex: 'We are targeting the under-served in the premium market. This includes
small business owners and those paying for travel themselves.'

Economy: Even the standard seats on the new Airbus A321s will be upgraded

Roomy: JetBlue is also introducing several Even More Space seats into economy class

Cheap: The airline has been a low-cost, single-class since its launch in 2000

The airline is also introducing a limited number of roomier seats in economy class, dubbed Even More Space seats, which customers can pay extra to use.

Currently, JetBlue have the fourth biggest market share of tickets bought between New York and Los Angeles.

As well as flights within the US, the airline also flies to parts of Central and South America.
