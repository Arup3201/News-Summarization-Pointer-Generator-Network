Today they are picturesque scenes of tranquility, but seventy years ago these sites in Northern France were the bloody stage for the D-Day landings.

With the anniversary of the Normandy Landings approaching next week, Getty Images have created a striking juxtaposition of the scenes in 1944 and now in 2014. 

The images show how the pretty market square of Trevieres once had the dead body of German solider splayed out across the street and how the quiet beach of St Aubin-sur-Mer was once the scene of thousands of Royal Marines marching through the waters. 

Next week the anniversary of the amphibious assault on June 6, 1944 will be marked with events on several of the Normandy beaches.

D-Day marked the start of the European invasion during the Second World War after five years of war with Germany.

Thousands of allied troops landed on the beaches in Northern France initiating the effort to liberate mainland Europe from Nazi occupation.

In total 75,215 British and Canadian troops and 57,500 US troops were landed by sea on D-Day. They began an attack that lasted for eleven months and took them all the way to Germany.
