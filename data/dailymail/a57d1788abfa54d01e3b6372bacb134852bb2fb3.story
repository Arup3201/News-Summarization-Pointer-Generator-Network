Regrettable tweets: One in four post messages on Twitter we wish we hadn't

In these days of instant communication it’s all too easy to put a tweet into gear while your brain’s still in neutral.

According to a survey, one in four of us have regretted posting something on a social media site, mainly because it was inappropriate or upset someone.

Around 40 per cent of 2,000 polled said they used websites such as Twitter and Facebook to speak up on an issue they felt passionate about.

Almost half believed that what they said had made a difference.

Posting comments was not without its pitfalls though, according to the study to mark Holocaust Memorial Day.

More than a quarter admitted they would say, or have said, something on a site they would never say to someone’s face.

A third of respondents had also witnessed or been a victim of online bullying.

Professor
 Robin Dunbar, Professor of Evolutionary Anthropology, Fellow of 
Magdalen College, Oxford, who analysed the findings, said: 'The rapid 
increase in the availability and use of social media has brought with it
 many positives and, as our research has revealed, one of these is the 
ability to speak up for things we are passionate about.

'However,
 it is important to remember that it is through experience in 
face-to-face interactions that we learn many of the social skills needed
 to navigate our way through our complex social world.

'Our research has shown that people are more prone to saying something on social media that they later regret, because in these digital environments we don’t receive the immediate checks and balances that we get during face-to-face interactions.

'This can therefore result in a careless or inappropriate tweet, or at worst, cyber bullying.'
