A pastor has forgiven a man accused of stabbing him 37 times and leaving him for dead after coming face to face with his alleged attacker in an emotion-charged court room.

Kevin Ramsby was savagely attacked by a burglar who broke into his home in Highland Park, Michigan.

Doctors thought he stood no chance of surviving his horrific wounds and called his wife to rush to the hospital before it was too late.

But, miraculously, the pastor survived and on Tuesday looked his alleged attacker Wesley McLemore in the eye during a preliminary court hearing.

Showing no bitterness, the man of God told ABC Action News: 'I’ve been forgiven much in my life. So for me it’s not too hard to forgive others when you’ve been forgiven yourself.'

McLemore, 41, was arrested in Alabama, four months after the attack and has now been extradited back to Michigan to face trial.

Proceedings have been delayed for two weeks before the case can come before a jury.

But Pastor Ramsby told ABC Action News: 'It’s been long awaited and I’m glad it’s here.' He added: 'Today
 I signed that I would, and asked and requested that if I could have an 
opportunity to sit down with him and speak with him I would want to if 
he would be willing.'

The priest also revealled how traumatic and life-changing the event two years ago had been.

He
 spent weeks in hospital recovering from the physical wounds and almost 
five months or daily therapy trying to heal the mental scars.

But the attack has not prevented him returning to his flock at Revival Tabernacle.

Pastor Ramsby vowed shortly after the incident to concentrate on turning the horrific ordeal into something positive.

He has set about turning a bookstore near his church into a new ministry for young men.
