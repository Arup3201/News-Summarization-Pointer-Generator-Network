Armed with a powerful sense of smell, this is the moment a Newfoundland dog quickly wins a game of hide and seek against his human counterpart. 

Sebastian was filmed sniffing around the backyard at home in America before he detected where his play pal was lurking.

Footage shows him nearing a garden couch where two-year-old Sierra sits quietly disguised under a blanket.

Found you! Sebastian was filmed sniffing around the backyard at home in America before he detected where his play pal was lurking

The canine moves forward to whip the cover-up away.

Sierra appears to be surprised by Sebastian's quick detection.

'How did he find me?' the toddler asks her mother, who laughs as she stands filming the sweet moment.

Sierra appears to be best of friends with the large dog.

Other videos show the pair hanging out and making trouble together.

In one clip Sierra teaches Sebastian ballet and in another clip they take a nap together.

The infant has been hanging out with the pup since birth. Sebastian is just over six years old.
