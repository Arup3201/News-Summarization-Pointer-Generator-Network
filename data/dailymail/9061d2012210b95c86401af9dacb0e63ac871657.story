A mother of three who says she was molested by Rolf Harris at age 15 has become the first of the star’s alleged victims to waive her right to anonymity.

Tonya Lee, 43, became suicidal, developed an eating disorder and binged on alcohol after he sexually assaulted her twice in a London pub, she told his trial yesterday.

The former child actress said Harris, now 84, laughed as he abused her.

It was announced at the start of the day that she had waived the anonymity given to alleged sex attack victims.

Jurors
 saw a picture of the 15-year-old on the ‘trip of a lifetime’ in 1986, 
when she travelled from her home in Australia to perform in British 
theatres.

But Southwark
 Crown Court heard that the children’s TV presenter left her so 
traumatised she needed hospital treatment in her 16-year battle with 
anorexia.

Jurors heard she tried to end her life with a potentially lethal mix of laxatives and alcohol.

Fighting
 back tears, she said Harris made her feel like an ‘empty vessel’ until 
her children, a seven-year-old and twins aged five, gave her a reason to
 live.

Rolf Harris arrives at Southwark Crown Court this morning where he is on trial for 12 counts of indecent assault between 1968 and 1986

Australian Tonya Lee, who has waived her right to anonymity, told the court that Harris molested her during a trip to the UK in 1986

She said: ‘I was drinking. I had eating disorders and I was taking 80 laxatives a day for eight years and throwing up.’

The alleged attacks happened in a London pub on the first night of her six-week tour with the Shopfront Theatre Youth Group.

Miss Lee was overwhelmed with excitement when Harris met the group of 14 children at Heathrow Airport as a surprise.

The court heard Harris met Ms Lee's theatre group when they landed at London's Heathrow Airport and later went for dinner at a pub with them

Harris has been supported by his wife, Alwen (second from right) and daughter Bindi (left) throughout the trial

The former television presenter denies all the counts

She
 said she felt ‘special’ when he singled her out at a pub meal later on.
 Her family idolised him and often played his 1960 hit, Tie me Kangaroo 
Down Sport.

Miss Lee said 
Harris told her: ‘Hey Tonya, come over and have a chat to me. Come and 
tell me a bit about yourself. Come and sit down on my lap.’

She
 sat astride him, she said, adding: ‘He was moving back and forth, just 
rubbing against me. He began moving his hand up my inner thigh, higher 
and higher. I started to panic then.

‘I
 was confused because the whole time this was happening normal 
interactions were going on . . . Rolf would say a joke and people would 
be laughing.’

She fled to the toilets, but he waited outside and a second assault took place, she added.

She said: ‘I froze. He put one arm around me in a bear hug – I could see no escape.’

Jurors
 heard the married father of one, then 56, pinned her between a wall and
 a pot plant. He put his hand down her blouse and then into her 
knickers.

He touched 
her intimately, hugged her and left her in a corridor, it was alleged. 
She said: ‘I was shocked, completely in disbelief.

‘I felt like if I said anything everyone would hate me and blame me because he was Rolf Harris.’

Miss
 Lee said she went on to shed 13lb on the tour, believing no one would 
attack her if she was thin. At home, she gave up her dream of acting. 
She said: ‘I became a master of putting on this happy mask.’

The court heard she went to police last May after seeing a Press report of Harris’s arrest.

Miss Lee said her ex-partner had encouraged her to sell her story to an Australian magazine and TV show for £33,000.

Sonia Woodley, QC, defending Harris, accused her of ‘spicing up’ her story with a PR agent and lying to police about money.

The
 witness choked with tears as she admitted lying to officers and said 
selling the story was a ‘huge mistake’. She added: ‘Not, in a million 
years, did I ever think that I would get a chance to sit here in a 
courtroom in England and say what happened.’

Harris,
 from Bray, Berkshire,  listened intently, passing notes to his 
barrister. He is accused of attacking four women aged seven to 19 from 
1968 to 1986. He denies 12 counts of indecent assault.
