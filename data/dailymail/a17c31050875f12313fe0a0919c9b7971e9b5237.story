Middle class retired people could be £1,000 better off every year under proposals to exempt them from paying income tax on their state pensions.

The Treasury’s tax advisers have suggested scrapping the levy because many pensioners consider it unfair.

The Office for Tax Simplification made the proposal in a report that condemned the current tax rules for retired people as 'confusing’.

According to HM Revenue and Customs estimates, almost 5.6million people receiving the basic state pension pay income tax.

Often, they do so because private pension payments and savings interest take their total income above the tax threshold.

More than 1.5 million of them have to fill in a self-assessment form.

The report to Treasury ministers pointed out there was a ‘patchwork of allowances and rules which many in their later years find very confusing’.

It added that making people pay tax on the basic state pension made the system significantly more complex.

Official figures show that less than 50 per cent of all retired people are even aware that their state pension income is subject to tax.

The report states: ‘Many of those who do understand that it is taxable feel that this is unjust, given that they have contributed through the national insurance system through their working life.’

And among the options considered in the report is: ‘exempt the state pension from tax altogether’.

Quantitative easing has increased the shortfalls in corporate pensions, industry experts have warned.

In an attempt to drive down interest rates the Bank of England resumed its gilt purchases in October.

But the move has added £90billion to pensions shortfalls, according to the National Association of Pension Funds.

'Businesses running final salary pensions are being clouted,' said Joanne Segars, chief executive of NAPF.

'Deficits that were already big now look even bigger because of [QE's] artificial distortions.'

She added that while NAPF was in favour of measures to stimulate the economy, QE had wreaked havoc on both personal and company pension schemes.

A full basic state pension is worth £5,311 a year, so pensioners would be £1,060 better off without paying the 20 per cent income tax on it.

The report stressed the advisers, an independent body set up by the Chancellor, George Osborne, had not yet reached a conclusion on the issue.

They will now study the implications of full tax exemption before producing recommendations for ministers in a second report expected later this year.

Another option they are considering is making all state pension payments through the PAYE system, so that they are taxed at source.

This could reduce the number of older people who suddenly find themselves burdened with self-assessment.

The report adds: ‘For some, the arrival of a combination of their state pension and a limited income from their savings and investment can mean for the first time that they need to complete a self-assessment tax return, just when they thought that life was getting easier.’

The Revenue and the Department for Work and Pensions could also do more to explain pension tax rules to the public, it added.

A Treasury spokesman said that ministers would respond to the report in the Budget later this month, but did not expect formal recommendations until later this year.
