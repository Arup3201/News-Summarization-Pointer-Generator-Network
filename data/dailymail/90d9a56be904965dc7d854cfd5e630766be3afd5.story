Runaway school girl Faye Jones gave her first TV interview today and revealed she feels ashamed of her behaviour and must now take responsibility for her 'selfish outburst'.

The teenager from Cramlington, Northumberland, went missing earlier this week after fleeing from her mother with Murat Can Ertani, 22, while on holiday at the Turkish holiday resort of Marmaris.

She was found by police four days later trying to hitch a ride with Can more than 40 miles from where they was last seen. She was reunited with her distraught mother Rhonda, 39, right away and, now back in the UK, the pair appeared on ITV's This Morning.

Moment of madness: Teenager Faye Jones said she didn't know what she was doing when she ran away with Murat Can Ertani

Bad behaviour: On This Morning, the teen said she's ashamed of what she put mother, Rhonda, right, through

Faye, 16, saw a video clip of her mother's desperate appeal to find her daughter and said it was 'awful' to see her reaction to her disappearing act.

She explained: 'When I woke up I didn't have plans to run away. It was just planned and done in half an hour.'

Faye said she had argued with her mother about returning to the UK as she wanted to stay on in Turkey with her grandmother. But Rhonda said she was so concerned about her daughter's proximity to Can - who she had seen slap another girl in a bar - she did not want to leave Faye behind.

'I couldn't leave her knowing what he could do,' Rhonda said.

Faye vented her anguish by messaging Can on Facebook complaining about having to leave and he told her she didn't have to. Not long after he was outside her hotel in his car.

Sympathy: Presenter Emma Bunton said it must have been a 'scary' time for Rhonda

'When I got in the car it was a thrill but at the same time crazy,' she admitted. 'I didn't really know what I was doing.'

Rhonda said she chased the car down the road in her tankini and flip flops and then rushed to the police station to report her daughter missing.

She said: 'I had to be calmed down I was just beside myself. I never dreamt she would do something like this, she's always been a really good, homely girl, it was out of character.'

Presenter Emma Bunton sympathised saying: 'It must have been so scary for you, as a mother myself you just worry so much.'

When asked by the former Spice Girl why she didn't contact her mother to let her know she was safe, Faye said: 'Later on I was hoping to be found because I was too ashamed to ring home. I knew she would forgive me but I was too ashamed.

'I knew what she must have been going through but it was a selfish outburst I don't really know what took over.'

Smiling again: The mother said they won't be returning to Turkey

When asked how she managed during her days on the run with Can, she said: 'We didn't have any money, I sold a gold ring for £10 that got us some food to get by but apart from that we had no money. We stayed at different, horrible places. We didn't have much to eat just enough to keep going.'

The Turkish waiter, who has been to prison six times, has been released by police after Faye decided not to press charges.

She said they did not have sex and he did not force her to run away.

She explained: 'I went willingly and it was my idea. Even though he's older and people will say he should know better it was also my fault and I have to take responsibility for that so I don't think he should go to jail.'

No charges: Faye said it wouldn't be right for Ertani to go to jail because it was her idea to run away

Photos have already emerged of Can back on the prowl in Marmaris as it was revealed yesterday that he is unrepentant.

He is reported to have said that English girls were 'easy' and claimed he would run away with Faye or another English girl, as long as they were over 18 - the Turkish age of consent.

'I am in love with the girl next to me,' he said. 'When she leaves there is always another one. Girls love a bad boy and that is me. Girls get boring and I cannot stay with just one for more than a few weeks.'

However, Rhonda said she won't be putting her daughter into that situation again. 'We won't be going back to Turkey,' she said.
