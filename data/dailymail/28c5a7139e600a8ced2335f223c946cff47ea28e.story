A schoolgirl was found slumped in a wardrobe by her twin sister after accidentally strangling herself with a dressing gown cord.

Grace Taylor, 13, had been cleaning her bedroom minutes before her sister Ellen walked in and discovered her unconscious body.

The ‘beautiful and kind’ teenager died in hospital two days later despite efforts to revive her.

The unusual nature of her death prompted police to launch an investigation, following suspicions that she may have been bullied.

But after the investigation ruled out any intimidation and found no evidence the schoolgirl was planning to commit suicide, a coroner said the death was accidental.

Only hours before the tragedy, Grace had discussed going on holiday with her family before her mother asked the twins to clean their rooms.

After tidying for ten minutes while listening to music, Ellen walked in to check on her sister and found her leaning in to the cupboard.

She initially thought her sister was playing a joke before she realised that her sister was unconscious and ran to her parents for help.

Her mother Christine told Newcastle Coroner’s Court that her daughter looked as if she had ‘slipped’ and was ‘leaning’ into the cord.

Grace Taylor, 13, accidentally strangled herself with a dressing gown cord in her wardrobe at the family home in Birtley, Gateshead 

When an ambulance arrived at the family home in Birtley, Gateshead, they found the schoolgirl with no pulse but managed to restore her circulation before taking her to hospital.

Doctors at Gateshead’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital pronounced her dead two days later after she showed no signs of recovery.

Dr Grace Williamson, a consultant paediatrician, said: ‘There had been a significant period of cardiac arrest due to lack of oxygen for more than 20 minutes. The brain had swollen as a result.’

The family welcomed the coroner’s accidental death verdict. 

Grace was a 'beautiful, kind and feisty little girl. She was just a great kid', her father said

Grace’s father Mike, a company director, said Ellen was coping ‘the best she can’ since her sister’s death in November last year and was being supported by her brother Alex, 18.

Mr Taylor, 41, said: ‘Grace was a beautiful, kind and feisty little girl. She was just a great kid.’

Mrs Taylor, an insurance worker, said after the inquest: ‘This doesn’t make anything any easier but it does confirm what we already knew all along – she wouldn’t have taken her own life.’

The schoolgirl studied at Lord Lawson of Beamish Academy, where she was predicted strong grades and was a keen sportswoman.

After the tragedy, Grace’s mobile phone, computer and iPad were examined by police. But Detective Sergeant Tanya Robinson from Northumbria Police told the inquest that an investigation found no evidence of mental health problems, bullying or suicidal planning.

Coroner Karen Dilks concluded: ‘There is no evidence that could satisfy me that Grace intended her actions.’
