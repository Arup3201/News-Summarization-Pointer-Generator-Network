We've all experienced that awful feeling of panic when we've left our purse or wallet somewhere.

But worries about lost money and cards could become a thing of the past, thanks to a 'smart wallet' that includes a chip so it can be easily located.

The Bluetooth device slots into the card holder of a purse and automatically links with a smartphone app - enabling its whereabouts to be tracked.

Wallet usage record: SmartWallit records every time the wallet is used and its phone app logs a person's usage habits, including the types of things they buy and how much they spend.

'I am here' function: Reminds a person at set intervals that their wallet is safely by their side.

'Two way anti lost' reminder: If a person forgets their wallet, a smartphone alert reminds them. And if they forget their phone, their wallet can remind them by beeping.

'Find me' function: The SmartWallit can serve as a tracking device.

Silence setting: if the wallet starts to ring, users can tap it twice to silence it quickly.

Not just for purses: The Bluetooth device can be attached to keys and luggage too.

If the wallet goes out of range of the app, a warning message will flash on the screen, displaying the last location where the wallet was used.

Jack Hu, the man behind, SmartWallit Pro, hopes the gadget will stop people leaving their purses in taxis and at the shops, as well as misplacing them at home.

The device is also designed to help people find out if their purse has been stolen.

The device can also be 'called' with 
the app from 30 feet away so that it makes a loud ringing noise to let 
owners know where it is, which could prove a godsend to people who 
regularly misplace belongings around their house.

For
 people who constantly fret about the whereabouts of their wallet in 
busy areas, the device can remind them it is safe at chosen intervals . 
‘It’s just a way for your wallet to just remind you, “Hey! I’m here!”’ 
he said.

The automatic 
‘loss detecting functions’ can be disabled in case an owner is in a 
quiet location or simply travelling without their wallet altogether.

Clever and colourful: The device will be available to buy in five shades so it can be matched to purses. It measures 4.2mm thick and is powered by a rechargeable Lithium-ion polymer battery

The device is just 4.2mm thick and is powered by a rechargeable Lithium-ion polymer battery.

It comes in five different colours - black, blue, pink, red and green - so it can be matched with purses, or equally stand out.

The gadget works with an iPhone, iPod Touch, and some Android 4.3 devices.

Mr Hu, from Shanghai in China said: ‘I invented the Smart Wallit Pro because I wanted to create an anti-loss Bluetooth device.

‘The Smart Wallit Pro connects with your phone and all you have to do is open the application and you will be all set.

‘If you leave your wallet behind, your phone will let you know, and if you leave your phone behind, your wallet will let you know.

He explained that when a person uses their wallet, the app will record the action using the device’s proximity and light sensor and send a message to the user’s smartphone.

‘With that information, your phone will be able to record when and where you last used your wallet,’ Mr Hu said.

The gadget works with an iPhone, iPod Touch, and some Android 4.3 devices. The Bluetooth device can also be attached to luggage so that it is easily found at an airport (pictured) as well as fixed to keys

‘To allow for a more accurate hunt, the app will show you the distance between your phone and your wallet.

‘If you misplace your wallet, you can also use the app to make it ring with a loud buzzer sound that is no trouble to hear even as far as 30ft away.

‘If you spent the whole weekend staying at home or at the office, you can disable the anti-loss function with the "No Disturb" mode,’ he added.

The Smart Wallit Pro will be manufactured in March this year and retail prices will be approximately £36, but the device can be ordered via Kickstarter for prices starting from $39 (£23 plus shipping).
