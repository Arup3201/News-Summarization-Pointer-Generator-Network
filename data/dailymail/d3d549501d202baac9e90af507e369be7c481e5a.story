A big-rig collided with a fire hydrant on a downtown San Francisco street on Friday afternoon, sheering it from its base and sending a geyser of water four stories high.

The scene just outside of Yelp Inc.'s headquarters kept the city's tech-savvy workers busy posting videos and photos of the drama outside their office windows.

Up in the air: A big-rig collided with a fire hydrant on a downtown San Francisco street on Friday afternoon, sheering it from its base and sending a geyser of water four stories high

Dramatic: The water from the hydrant is seen soaring into the sky

Lisa Halsey, who works for the Trulia real-estate listing service, said she 'heard something go pop' and rushed outside to see the water gushing. 

Halsey was among those who captured the scene and posted it online.

Mindy Talmadge, a spokesperson for San Francisco fire, told KTVU the collision took place 'at about 1:40p.m.,' the affiliate station said. 

KGO-TV reported '[t]he roads were reopened around 2:30 p.m., just after the water was shut off.'

A replacement hydrant is expected soon, a spokesman for San Francisco Public Utilities Commission told SFGate. 

On call: Firefighters were filmed at the scene stopping the flow off the hydrant
