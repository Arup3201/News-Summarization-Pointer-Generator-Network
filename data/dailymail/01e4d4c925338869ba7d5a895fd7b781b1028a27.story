I have just returned from Brazil but not before I witnessed the dejection of a nation almost in mourning after Neymar broke a bone in his back.

I’ve heard some stupid things in my time, but for people to blame the referee for that injury is utter nonsense.

It wasn’t an Under 11s game – these are grown men. And one professional footballer decided to stick his knee into the back of another pro at full force for no real reason.

If the guilty man – Colombia’s Juan Zuniga - thinks that because his team-mates James Rodriguez was being fouled at other times in the game, he has licence to go in that hard with a reasonable chance he will cause injury (watch it again, it’s not a tactical foul, it’s not mistimed, it’s not a tap on the ankle it is a full force knee in the small of the Brazilian’s back), then he is wrong.

I’ve heard ex-pros talk about the referee giving a team 'a free one.' This is where a bad foul is committed by a player from Team A on a player from Team B, but the referee doesn’t give a yellow card when perhaps he should.

Team B then think they have ‘a free one.’ In other words they think they can commit virtually any foul they like and they will also get away with it.

How old are these players? Ten? Playground logic. Any chance they could get on with playing football instead of trying to work out if they can get away with kicking and injuring their opponents?

Fouls will happen, and sometimes it will be a tactic to commit fouls on certain players to stop their flow and that’s how Brazil decided to deal with the threat of Rodriguez. But none of the fouls on the Colombian were even close to causing him the kind of horrific injury that Neymar has suffered.

Blaming the referee is an easy way for professional footballers to wash their hands of the crimes of their colleagues.

The referee for Brazil’s victory over Colombia, Spaniard Carlos Velasco Carballo, wasn’t particularly good (he was also the ref who failed to send off Uruguay’s Diego Godin against England), but he didn’t break Neymar’s back.
