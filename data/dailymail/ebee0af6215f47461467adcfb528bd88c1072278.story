In the annals of crime, Jamie Neil is unlikely to be troubling anyone compiling a list of renowned  masters of disguise.

For the hapless 41-year-old could not even rustle up a balaclava or hoodie for his hold-up of a petrol station – and instead carried out the raid with a clear plastic bag pulled over his head.

To make matters worse, Neil’s accomplice, Gareth Tilley, pretended his mobile phone was a gun, only to have its screen light up and give the game away.

Neil had been at his home with Tilley,
 20, when they decided to rob the store and grabbed ‘the nearest thing’ 
they had, a court heard. Tilley wrapped a scarf around his head but Neil
 used the bag. After seeing CCTV video of the raid, an off-duty 
policewoman recognised Neil in the street several days later.

He was jailed for two years at Truro 
Crown Court for the robbery on September 27 last year. Tilley was 
previously jailed for two years.

Speaking after the hearing, Detective 
Constable Steve White said Neil’s disguise was the most ‘ridiculous’ he 
had come across. He added: ‘Tilley disguised his face using a scarf and 
Neil, being less resourceful, put a plastic bag on his head.

‘I investigated the case, with CCTV 
and forensic evidence used to identify the assailants.’ Both men were 
high on alcohol and stolen medication when they stormed the petrol 
station Co-op in St Austell, Cornwall.

Tilley pointed his phone at the lone 
counter worker and demanded cash but she soon realised it was not a gun 
and pressed an alarm. Neil wrestled with the brave woman before 
headbutting her and fleeing, getting away with bottles of spirits.

But his face was easily visible through the bag and a CCTV image was distributed among police.

Two days later off-duty Detective Constable Lauren Holley was driving her mother home when she saw Neil and called for back-up.

Neil, of Bethel, Cornwall, was  
convicted of robbery and jailed by Judge John Neligan, who praised the 
shop assistant’s courage.

Tilley, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty last
 November.
