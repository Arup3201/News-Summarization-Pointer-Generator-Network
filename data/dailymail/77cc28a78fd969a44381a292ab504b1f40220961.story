With Premier League clubs targeting so many players abroad sometimes it can be hard to keep track of them all. Here, Sportsmail's Adam Crafton explains everything you need to know about Mattia Destro.

So, just who is Mattia Destro?

Destro is a 23-year-old Italian forward that plays for Roma. He is believed to be on the radar of Tottenham and Chelsea.

What would he bring to the team?

Pace, power, trickery and goals. Thirteen in twenty appearances for Roma last season, including seven in the final eight games of the season. He was a surprising exclusion from Italy’s World Cup squad.

Why do Tottenham need a forward?

Roberto Soldado struggled badly last season and Mauricio Pochettino is on the search for reinforcements. Spurs scored only 30 goals at White Hart Lane during the last campaign and that record must improve if they are to launch a potent challenge for the top 4.

How much would he cost?

Roma are prepared to do business but would demand close to £20m for the forward. They have also believed to have approached Chelsea over a loan move for Fernando Torres that could see Destro move to Stamford Bridge as part of the deal. German side Wolfsburg were also interested earlier in the summer.

Is there a risk?

The player’s wage demands are said to be in the region of £90,000-a-week while he also has a fiery temperament. In April, he was banned for three Serie A games after hitting Caligliari defender Davide Astori in the face.
