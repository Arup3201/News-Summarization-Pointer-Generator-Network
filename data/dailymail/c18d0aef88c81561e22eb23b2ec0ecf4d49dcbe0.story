You will need a head for heights and a strong stomach if you are thinking of giving this kind of photography a go.

Rooftopping is the heart-stopping photography movement which involves daredevils climbing to the top of city skyscrapers, hanging off the edge and taking pictures of the spectacular views around them.

Thrill seeker Tom Ryaboi is at the forefront of the craze and has captured a series of daring perspectives from high above.

No fear: Thrill-seeking photographer Tom Ryaboi continues to scale the tall skyscrapers of Toronto exploring the urban landscape from the dizzy heights above

The Toronto-based photographer has 
had an inescapable affinity for great heights since he was a toddler 
when he was caught climbing his parents' refrigerator.

He now manages to trek to the top of 
vertigo-inducing towers with a team of like-minded friends to snap 
beautiful shots against the amazing cityscape.

Whether they feature someone dangling
 their feet from the edge of a building, tip-toeing on the ledge, or 
hanging from a rail, each image presents a unique, aerial viewpoint of 
these young adventurers exploring and appreciating their urban 
landscape.

Disguising themselves so they can 
carry out their daring stunts, the daredevils avoid security and 
CCTV before climbing to the top of the skyscrapers and hanging off the 
edge - photographing as much evidence as proof of their antics.

Above the world: The stunning photography shots produce amazing results but photographers have to go to extreme lengths to capture the images

Acrobatic: Tom says he enjoys the isolation he feels hundreds of feet above the pavement

Ryaboi has said in the past: 'I try 
to blend in as much as possible. In an office building I dress like I 
work there, on a construction site I dress like the workmen.

'It's in my blood. When I was a child one day, my dad came home from work and found me sitting on top of the fridge.

'They had no idea how I had got there, but obviously I just liked climbing things.'

Dramatic: Tom captured this bolt of lightning above the Toronto skyline in his series of photographs called Rooftopping

Peaceful: Tom said that when he sits on top of a rooftop everything slows down and the sounds of the busy streets are muted

Having spent the past five years on 
top of Canada's largest city's roofs, Tom enjoys the isolation he feels 
hundreds of feet above the pavement.

He added: 'I've been on the top three
 tallest buildings in Toronto. But I often tell people it's not really 
the height the matters.

'The coolest views are often from lower buildings nestled in between the tall ones.

'You really get a sense you're in the urban 'jungle' then, surrounded by this forest of concrete, steel and glass.

Using the internet to spread his new 
found love of storming skyscraper roofs, Tom has now inspired other 
rooftoppers to start climbing too.

'I'm not the first in the world, but 
I've introduced about 20 people to rooftopping and now groups of men and
 women are all trying to do it.'

Risky business: Photographer Tom Ryaboi (pictured) has climbed more than 100 buildings and produced some of the most stunning examples of Rooftopping to date

Vertiginous: A dedicated few 'Rooftoppers' are determined to climb to the top of every skyscraper roof in their city, hang off the edge and photograph the evidence as proof

Long way down: The craze involves thrill seekers climbing to the top of city skyscrapers and taking pictures of the spectacular view beneath them
