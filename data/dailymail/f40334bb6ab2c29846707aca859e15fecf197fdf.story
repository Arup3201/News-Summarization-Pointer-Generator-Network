In a few months, they’ll be underground and deep in hibernation.

But for now, black bears across the western United States have taken to scavenging for food to fatten up before the winter, and for many across Colorado, it has become a record problem - and is getting worse.

In August alone, police in Aspen received nearly 300 calls to report the lumbering creatures, up a staggering 668 per cent from last year.

The Aspen Times reported late last month that bear activity has been up significantly this year compared with years past. 

Aspen Police Department bear specialist Dan Glidden told the Times that the influx in bears is in part due to this year’s severe drought conditions.

He said that bears have been forced into urban and suburban areas this year because food supplies are short elsewhere. A dumpster or trash can becomes a meal for the creatures.

Aspen Public Radio’s Marci Krivonen noted similar conditions. She reported: ‘The drought has dried up many of the chokecherry and acorn crops that normally grow abundantly, so the bears must search for their dinner.’

Another problem is that the human population has bled into the bear’s natural habitat, meaning they must search greater distances for food sources.

ABC News predicted today that the bear epidemic out West will worsen as the summer ends and fall commences, as bears must consume highly-caloric meals in preparation for winter.

‘They’re looking at trying to consume 20,000 calories a day,’ Colorado Parks and Wildlife Department’s Randy Hampton told ABC News.

Last week, a Montana rancher shot and killed a black bear that scaled a tall fence and broke into his house to rummage for food this week along the Rocky Mountain Front.

Lane Yeager discovered damage when he returned to his home near Choteau on Monday evening. The young male bear had broken through a screen and entered an open window, wrecked a lazy Susan and tore off a door to get to food in the trash and in the pantry.

'It was dark out. I was headed for the light switch when it ran across ahead of me,' Yeager told the Great Falls Tribune. 'That's when I knew I had an issue.'

Mike Madel, grizzly bear management specialist with the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, said the bear had probably been in the house for an hour. Yeager dispatched it with a rifle.

'I killed it so someone else wouldn't have to,' Yeager said. 'We're fat with grizzlies, but the black bear was off the beaten path.'

Indeed, bears will go to any lengths necessary to get the calories they’re craving. In Colorado last week, a hungry black bear broke into a Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory store in Estes Park, Colorado to find his favourite treats.

Mr Glidden said that the black bear epidemic can be lessened slightly by safe practices. For one, waste should be placed in bear-proof containers.

Those who don’t comply with city mandates will be subject to heavy fining.

Bears that are recovered from populated areas have a two-strike policy, Colorado Parks and Wildlife spokesperson Mike Porras said. After the first offence, the bear is tagged and relocated.

After the second strike, they are euthanized. 

Already, at least 28 bears have been put down.
