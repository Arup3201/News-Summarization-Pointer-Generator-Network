A six-year-old boy was rescued by helicopter after he plunged 40 feet down a waterfall.

The six-year-old, Hayden Frazier, was rushed to UCLA Medical Center after the accident, at the Escondido Falls about a mile south of the Kanan Road in Malibu, California, according to CBS Los Angeles.

The boy had been on a hike with his family on Sunday when he got ahead of them and fell nearly 40 feet from the top of a waterfall.

His mother Julie Frazier said: 'We were looking for him. We heard some screaming. We went to go find him. And basically he had fallen off the waterfall.'

Hayden suffered a puncture wound to his head but has no broken bones. Luckily, a medical school student was nearby and treated him at the scene.

'The doctor had him on his back. She had something applied to his head with the puncture wound,' Julie said.

'He had jackets all over him keeping him warm. He was more terrified than anything.'

The rescue helicopter took him to the 
hospital while Hayden's family were forced to hike two miles back to 
their car and drive to the hospital as paramedics wanted to get Hayden to the hospital as quickly as possible.

His frantic parents didn't have time to get the names of the people that helped their boy.

Julie added: 'Thank you so much for helping us. It was just a traumatic experience. And so crazy and we couldn't have done it without you guys. And you guys know who you are.'

The boy fell feet from the upper falls, suffering 'bumps and bruises but was otherwise in good condition,' according to the Malibu Search and Rescue team's Facebook page.

Earlier in the day, the search and rescue team received a call about a female hiker with a reported broken leg on the Backbone Trail.
