Matt-Dillion Shannon has been denied parole for the second time. He was sentenced to three years' in jail for setting another boy on fire at a birthday party

A teenager who poured petrol on another teenager and set him alight in a 'Jacka**-style prank' has been denied parole on the grounds that he may still pose a risk.

Matt-Dillion Shannon, 19, was sentenced to three years' imprisonment after he celebrated turning 17 by setting Hayden Calder, then 16, alight in August 2012 at his own birthday party.

Mr Calder attended the birthday party in Hastings, New Zealand, along with 70 other people, but about midnight became tired and went to Shannon's bedroom where he sat on the floor.

He told the court that Shannon entered the room and picked up a 10-litre plastic petrol container before leaving, reported Fairfax NZ.

Shannon returned to the room with eight other people and told the others to grab Mr Calder and then three people held him down.

'He [Shannon] was laughing. He picked up the petrol can and was pouring it over me. It felt wet and warm. I thought it was just water. When I figured out it wasn't, I freaked out,' Mr Calder told police in an interview that was played in the court.

When Shannon pulled a lighter from his pocket Mr Calder pleaded with him not to harm him.

'I said, “Matt, please don't do this.” I was begging him,' Fairfax NZ reported.

Shannon held the lighter to Mr Calder's T-shirt  and flames ran up the garment, onto Mr Calder's neck and face.

He told the police that the pain was incomprehensible.

Mr Calder, who was 16 at the time of the incident, required hospital treatment for his injuries, which he said were excruciating

'It was the most excruciating thing you could imagine, times 10,' he said.

Mr Calder was held down for about 20 seconds before he was able to run out of the room.

He pulled off his T-shirt, which was still on fire, and rode home on his bicycle, shirtless.

Fairfax NZ reported that Sally Calder, the victim's mother, heard her son screaming as he approached the house.

He was taken to the hospital and treated in the intensive care unit for burns to his body.

At court Shannon claimed that he was attempting a 'Jackass-style' prank on Mr Calder who was very drunk and had vomited through Shannon's bed.

He also claimed to have only poured a shot glass of petrol on Mr Calder.

However, Mr Calder claimed he had not been drinking at the party as he was recovering from glandular fever, and police found no sign of vomit at the scene.

He insisted that Shannon had poured petrol on him straight from a cosntainer.

Shannon pleaded guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with reckless disregard but not guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

His lawyer, Bill Calver, said Shannon thought Mr Calder would 'roll around, put the fire out, no harm done, and it would be a big laugh for all those present'.
