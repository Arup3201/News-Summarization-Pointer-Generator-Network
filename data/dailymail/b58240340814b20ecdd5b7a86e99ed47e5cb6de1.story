Ariel Castro, who is accused of imprisoning three women in his home for a decade, allegedly beat his former wife so badly that she suffered two broken noses, shattered ribs and a blood clot on the brain.

Grimilda 'Nilda' Figueroa was also left with  a knocked-out tooth and two dislocated shoulders from the domestic abuse, according to a 2005 court filing against her former husband.

The documents also claim that Castro 'frequently abducts his daughters and keeps them from mother' - although it is not certain whether this occurred before or after he allegedly snatched Michelle Knight, then 21, Amanda Berry, then 16, and Gina DeJesus, then 14, from the streets.

The filing asked the court to 
pass a protection order banning Castro from contacting Figueroa or their
children and from harassing them.

It requested that a judge 'keep [Castro] from threatening to kill [Figueroa]', The Plain Dealer reported, claiming that he had threatened to kill her three or four times already that year.

Figueroa's brother, Jose, told RadarOnline that he believes Castro's treatment of his former wife caused her to die. She passed away in April last year.

'I believe he murdered my sister,' he said. 'He abused her for years. She had multiple instances of serious head trauma and it created a brain tumor in her head.'

Of the treatment, Jose added: 'My sister was in hell living with him. She was trapped there and there was nothing we could do. She was afraid of him.'

Police records show that Castro was arrested for domestic violence in 1993, but that a grand jury declined to indict him.

But in 1996, she escaped to a woman's shelter with the couple's children, Angie, Emily, Anthony and Rosie. In January 1997, she was awarded full custody of the children.

After the 2005 filing, a temporary protection order was granted instructing Castro to stay away from the family. It also banned him from owning a deadly weapon, using drugs or alcohol.

Castro signed it but it was dismissed two months 
later when Figueroa's lawyer was unable to attend a scheduled 
hearing in the case due to another court commitment,Â The Telegraph reported.

Speaking to MailOnline, one of
Castro's sons, Anthony, depicted his father as a violent, controlling 
man who nearly beat his mother to death in 1993 while she was recovering
from brain surgery.

'Having that relationship with my dad all these years when we lived in a
house where there was domestic violence and I was beaten as well... we 
never were really close because of that,' he said.

In 1996, Castro was accused of pulling a fence post from a neighbor's property amid a dispute and the neighbor's six-year-old daughter later fell in the hole and hurt herself.

Castro, who said in court documents he had called police repeatedly about the neighbor, was ordered to pay $241 in damages.

On Monday, Castro was arrested along with his two brothers after three women who had allegedly been held captive at his Cleveland home for a decade were found by authorities.

Found: Gina DeJesus, left, was just 14 when she 
vanished in 2004, while another alleged victim Amanda Berry, right, was 
16 when she went missing in 2003. Both women were found on Monday

Missing: Michelle Knight, now 32, was also found inside the home, nearly 11 years after she went missing

On Monday afternoon, Amanda Berry, 26, who disappeared in 2003, was heard screaming by a neighbor, who helped her escape through a screen door. She used a neighbor's phone to call 911.

Gina Dejesus, 23, who went missing in 2004, and Michelle Knight, 32, who vanished in 2002, were also found alive at the home. They were taken to hospital with a six-year-old girl, who was born to Berry while she was in captivity.

It appears that his treatment of his wife was just the beginning of the horror he inflicted on women.

Police confirmed on Wednesday that they found ties and chains inside the home to restrain the girls, while the victims allegedly suffered miscarriages after being assaulted and then beaten at the home.

Local police sources revealed that Ariel Castro would use a sick game to 'train' the three girls not to run away by pretending to leave the house, only to beat them if they tried to run free.

This is said to be just one of the manipulative tactics he used to keep the three young women in his house for up to ten years, in addition to frequent beatings and chains hanging from the ceiling.

He also reportedly turned the home into a 'fortress' by setting up a stockade round the back.

He used chicken wire and blue tarpaulin to make an eight-foot high fence and let the trees and bushes go overgrown so nobody could see in.

Casto is likely to face charges today, authorities have said.
