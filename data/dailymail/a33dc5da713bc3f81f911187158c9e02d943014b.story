Martin Odegaard was born just six months after Norway's last appearance at a World Cup finals, but they might not have to wait another decade and a half before they're back on the biggest stage if Europe's latest teenage sensation fulfills the hype.

Stromsgodset's midfield magician has been linked with Europe's finest at the tender age of 15, and is already the Norwegian Tippeligaen's most talked-about player.

He's a Liverpool fan - you can probably thank John Arne Riise for that - but Real Madrid could be ready to table a £12million plus bid for the attacking midfielder, who is already firmly bedded into David Nielsen's side, scoring three times in 12 league and cup appearances with half the season gone.

Fellow European giants Bayern Munich and Manchester United have already seen Odegaard in action first-hand, welcoming the wonderkid to train with them last winter. He also trained with Bundesliga side Stuttgart, and supposedly 'visited' Manchester City last year.

He signed a professional contract with Stromsgodset in May to keep him at the club for 2014 and 2015, but the two-time Norwegian champions will be bracing themselves for a bombardment of interest, and could receive a fee to strengthen their finances for years to come.

Even at this age, Odegaard lacks very little. He has balance, agility, confidence and a ferocious shot. To add, the Drammen-born star has shown the strength to suggest he can mix it with the big boys in the big leagues, not shying away from duels with defenders twice his size.

Odegaard has attracted some firm attention on these isles, but from north of the border from Celtic. Earlier in July, Hoops manager Ronny Deila rejected claims the Scottish Premiership champions could not afford to sign the young starlet.

'It’s incorrect to say that Martin is outwith our range,' Deila told Norwegian TV. 'Martin must do what is best for him and we will do what is best for us - we’ll see if our paths meet at a later date.

'Martin is a good player but not even close to being a Celtic player at the moment. But there’s no doubt that he has the capability to be in the future.'

It is not uncommon for clubs to battle it out with several other giants for the signature of a young star, and this is no different.

In fact, Odegaard's father, former professional Hans Erik Odegaard, told Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang there have been over 30 clubs asking about his son.

'I can't name the clubs, but almost regardless of who you name, they have been in contact with us,' Odegaard senior told Verdens Gang.

Verdens Gang reported that clubs such as Barcelona, Manchester United, Manchester City, Juventus, PSG and Ajax have visited Stromsgodset's Marinelyst home ground to see Odegaard in action.

'We want Martin to develop,' said his 
40-year-old father, adding that it would be impossible to visit all the 
clubs that have been in contact.

'That
 (development) has been the focus over the years. If you start to think 
about other things, I think the development comes to a halt,' Odegaard 
said.

This isn't a 
matter of if Odegaard will leave Norway, more a matter of when. With 
just weeks until the new season in the Premier League, Bundesliga and La
 Liga - and with the Norwegian league still in progress - scouts will 
have to act quick to capture the youngster.
