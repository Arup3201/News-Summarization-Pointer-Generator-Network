GM cars are set to become their own high speed internet hotspots under new plans revealed by the car giant today.

2015 models will come with a built in hotspot capable of connecting to the high speed 4G LTE network.

It will allow up to seven devices to connect - and enable the car to use online services.

GM's system will be in over 30 models from the small Chevrolet Spark to the giant Suburban.

For owners who expect minimal use of broadband, data plans start at $5 a month for 250 megabytes of data.

Prices then range up to $50 a month for 10 gigabytes for the heaviest users. 

If you're already an AT&T subscriber, you can add your car to that plan for $10 a month. 

'In addition to allowing consumers to bring in and connect to personal mobile devices, the vehicle will also act as its own mobile device, enabling embedded vehicle capabilities,' said Mary Chan, president, Global Connected Consumer, General Motors. 

'Turning this vision into a reality starts with enabling fast, reliable and responsive connectivity within the vehicle,' she said. 

'Through this built-in 4G LTE connection we have the opportunity to reinvent the mobile experience inside a vehicle.' 

The device will be an option in over 30 models from the Chevrolet Spark to the Suburban.

Along with GM, Audi also is introducing 4G LTE in some models.

It comes as Apple and Google are set to battle over in-car entertainment systems -with both offering car versions of their mobile phone software. 

The GM broadband connection will work through its OnStar subscription service, which provides emergency help and navigation. 

But a new basic level of OnStar, free for five years, will come with all new 2015 Chevrolet, Buick, Cadillac and GMC cars.

GM also is introducing another new technology -- wireless charging for cell phones.

It automatically charges your cell phone when you put it in a special compartment instead of having to plug it in.

With the phone shut away, drivers will be more likely to use voice controls for any phone call, GM hopes. 

GM executive John McFarland told CBS: 'We think this will provide not only a better but a safer experience.'
