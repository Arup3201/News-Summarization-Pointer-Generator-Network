The Federal Communications Commission has received a series of complaints over a recent on-air outburst by New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, even though none of it was audible.

And the NFL star isn't happy about it. 

The fiery 37-year-old unleashed several F-Bombs toward the end of the November 30 game against the Green Bay Packers, after it became apparent his team was set to lose.

While it was obvious Brady was cursing the notorious four letter word, it was not picked up by microphones during the national broadcast by both CBS and NBC.

However that did not stop at least three viewers filing official complaints with the FCC.

At issue was the fact children watching the game could easily lip read and understand what Brady was screaming out.

Brady has since spoken about his in-game swearing,  explaining NFL players aren’t 'choirboys'

'My eight-year-old grandson was watching the game with me and even commented that he should not have said that,' a Pennsylvania grandparent complained to the FCC, according to The Smoking Gun. 

'I understand the first time it happened that the camera man would not have expected that, but to keep the camera on Tom Brady as he kept yelling was uncalled for.'

Another complainer added: 'They clearly knew he was saying it and so did my 10-year-old son … It was almost as if the announcers got away with it, because they didn't actually say it. 

'Very unprofessional.'

Third complainant, an Indianapolis parent, wrote that their 'six-year-old children know how to read lips even if there is no sound'.

Brady has since addressed the situation, and said it was not his fault.

He explained that NFL players aren't 'choirboys' and that upset viewers should 'blame CBS and NBC for putting it on TV'.

'I wish I did have a better mouth out there at times, but there's nothing that quite expresses the way I feel like that word,' Brady said Monday on WEEI.

 'It is, it is (a great word), especially in the heat of the moment … Blame CBS and NBC for putting it on TV. 

'Don't blame me. We're not choirboys, I know that. 

'You bring us up to a certain level of intensity to the game, you're job is to go out there and physically, emotionally, mentally dominate the game'

'You don't do that at church on Sunday. You've got to go to the football field for that.' 

Brady has three children - a son with former partner, actress Bridget Moynahan, and a son and a daughter with model wife Gisele Bundchen. 

He has not won  a Super Bowl in almost a decade.
