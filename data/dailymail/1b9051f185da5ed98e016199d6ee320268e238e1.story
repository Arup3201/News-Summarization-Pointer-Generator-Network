They are one of the most romantic and iconic images of New York City but soon the horse-drawn carriages that have carried countless tourists round Central Park could be a thing of the past.

Animal rights groups have long campaigned to ban horses from the congested city streets, and now the leading mayoral candidates are backing them.

With only three weeks to go before the November 5 election, candidate Bill de Blasio has even said that if he is voted in he would replace the horses with eight-seater electric cars.

'We are in the biggest, densest urban area in North America. It is not a place for horses. They are not meant to be in traffic jams,' Mr de Blasio, the Democrat front-runner said at a press conference with NY Class, an animal rights group.

Although he previously passed on the chance to legislate on the rides in 2007, Mr de Blasio has now said he would ban the horses within a week of taking office.

Members of the animal rights activists he is backing have donated to his campaign. According to the New York Post, records showed the group's co-founder, Steve Nislick, contributed the maximum $4,950 and two others, Wendy and John Neu, have paid in $9,900.

While Mr de Blasio says a ban is needed on humane reasons, what offends his Republican opponent Joe Lhota most about the $15 million a year trade is the smell.

'The smell that they drop there is unfortunate. The smell on Central Park South is also unfortunate,' he said earlier this year, according to the Daily News.

But Christina Hansen, a carriage driver from Kentucky who has become the face of the industry, which has about 200 horses and provides work for nearly 400 people in New York, says the mayoral candidates have it all wrong.

'It's all a bunch of hysteria,' the 33-year-old carriage driver said, as she negotiated Manhattan traffic with her horse, Sara. 'Their agenda is not animal welfare. It's animal rights,' she said.

'We bred horses to be powerful, willing partners in our civilization. They project their own human emotions on to horses,' she said.

The Central Park carriage ride has been immortalized in cinema. In Woody Allen's Manhattan, Allen's character kisses his young girlfriend in the back of a carriage. 

It is a scene that has been played out in several TV series too, from Sex and the City to 30 Rock. 

'People come to us for the clip-clop. Nobody wants to pet a fender,' Ms Hansen said.

When they aren't taking tourists around the sights of Central Park the horses are kept in stables such as Clinton Park, which is home to 78 horses.

The rules regulating the carriage industry are set by the city. Horses work no more than nine hours a day, and every year spend at least five weeks on a farm.

A veterinarian examines every horse twice a year and city inspectors visit regularly. Ms Hansen joked that the stable has more inspections 'than a day-care facility'.

Over the past 30 years, three horses have died in traffic accidents, the latest in 2006. NY Class has recorded 19 accidents over the past two years that resulted in injury, but the carriage industry said most were minor incidents.

Allie Feldman, executive director of NY Class, said horses don't belong in traffic and an eco- friendly motorized alternative could catch on with tourists.

'It retains the romantic, classic, nostalgic feel that you would get in a horse-drawn carriage, only it doesn't have the smell, it doesn't have the cruelty and it's much more safe,' she said. 'We think we're offering a really fair compromise.'

End of an era: Mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio has said he will ban the trade within a week of taking office

In Central Park South, across from the Plaza Hotel, Charlene Dertinger, 46, a native New Yorker celebrating a new job with a ride around the park, said it would be a shame to lose that tradition.

'I want to treat myself. I'm just going to sit by myself and enjoy the scenery,' she said.

Close by, Australians Hazel and Terry Watkins were just finishing their trip, which they said was 'very New York'.
