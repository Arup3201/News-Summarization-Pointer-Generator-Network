Arsene Wenger offloading the youngster makes his determination to sign a centre half more pressing.

On the move: Miquel has never really managed to establish himself as an Arsenal player

Aston Villa's Ron Vlaar has emerged as a shock target, while Arsenal are also interested in Manchester City's Matija Nastasic.

They have seen attempts to sign Kostas Manolas fail after the Greek defender joined Roma.

Miquel has struggled to establish himself in the Gunners' first-team and has been told he can leave the Emirates Stadium.

The Spanish prospect is in the final year of his contract and had a seven game spell on loan at Leicester City last season.

It was originally though Miquel's protracted move to Carrow Road would be on loan, but it is understood the Canaries want to take him on a permanent deal.
