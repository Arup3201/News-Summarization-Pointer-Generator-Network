Attorney General Eric Holder has cited a 'history of mistrust' between officers and the residents of Ferguson, Missouri, as he announced a wide-ranging civil rights investigation of the entire police department in the wake of the shooting of unarmed black teen Michael Brown by a white cop.

Holder also said that the Justice Department is reviewing the conduct of the St. Louis County Police Department - and the inquiry could spread to other departments in the St. Louis area if investigators deem it necessary.

Holder, who visited Ferguson last month as riots and protests flared up after 18-year-old Brown was gunned down by Officer Darren Wilson on August 9, said residents told him about a 'deep mistrust' between the overwhelmingly white police force and the majority black population of Ferguson.

'As a result of this history, and after of a review of documented allegations of incidents, we have determined that there's cause for the Justice Department to open an investigation of whether there is a pattern and practice of officers in Ferguson violating constitutional rights or federal laws,' Holder announced.

The heavily-militarized Ferguson and St. Louis County police response to protests in the streets shocked the nation and served to further inflame racial tensions

In response 
to the investigation, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson defended his 
department - saying his officers have done an 'excellent job.'

However, he conceded to NBC News: 'We can be better and we're willing to be.'

Brown's
 killing triggered massive protests in Ferguson and started a national 
debate on race relations and the use of force by police.

The
 community's anger at the shooting resulted in massive protests and, in 
some instances, vandalism and violence on the city streets. In response,
 heavily-armed Ferguson and St. Louis County police in tactical gear 
took to the streets with automatic weapons and armored military vehicles
 in an attempt to restore order.

The Justice Department investigation will 
look at the practices in the past few years of the police department, 
including patterns of stops, arrests and use of force, as well as the 
training the officers receive. The investigation will focus on whether officers showed a pattern of discriminating against black residents,  the New York Times report.

Holder has personally assured Brown's family that the Justice Department investigation will be 'thorough and independent,' according to the newspaper.

The Attorney General and his staff decided to launch a wider investigation of police in the St. Louis area when claims came to light of a history of police abuse of power after Brown's death.

Black community leaders say black residents endure a pattern of harassment and abuse at the hands of the mostly-white police force and claim Bown's shooting was just the most egregious example.

The Justice Department's investigation will focus on  whether Ferguson police have shown a 'pattern or practice' of violating the constitutional or civil rights of residents.

This will include an examination of the department's history of using force - including shootings.

Federal investigators will also look at arrests traffic stop to determine whether officers have a history of habitually harassing or targeting residents.

'Pattern or practice' investigations are authorized under a 1994 law passed after the Los Angeles police beating of Rodney King, which was caught on video. 

Attorney General Eric Holder has opened 20 such investigations during his tenure - twice as many a were launched in the five years before he took over the Justice Department.

Often, the investigations result in federal lawsuits and Justice Department oversight of local police departments.

Recently, the Justice Department cracked down on the Albuquerque Police Department after finding officers repeatedly used force - including deadly force - open people who did not pose a risk to the community.

Five
 current officers on one former member of the Ferguson police department
 are the subject of lawsuits alleging excessive force. There are at 
least six other internal investigations of excessive force ongoing, the Washington Post reports.

The
 investigations include claims that officers hog-tied a 12-year-old boy 
who was checking his family's mailbox, pistol-whipped multiple children 
and Tasered a mentally-ill man who later died in police custody.

One man said he was brutally beaten by officers in 2009 and then charged with destruction of government property for getting his blood on their uniforms.

Holder hasn't restricted his investigators to keeping their inquiry in Ferguson, either. The Times reports that federal watchdogs could also begin digging into civil rights issues in the St. Louis County police force and other departments in the St. Louis area.

Much of St. Louis County is heavily segregated and many black-majority areas are policed by departments that are overwhelmingly white.

Ferguson is two-thirds black, but only four of the department's 53 officers are black. In nearby Dellwood, nearly 80percent of residents are black, but 17 of the town's 18 police officers are white.

In addition to the federal investigation, the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney has convened a grand jury to look into the case. That could result in charges being filed against Wilson, if it finds he fired without just cause.

The Ferguson Police Department is also conducting an internal review of the case.

Police have said Brown was shot after a scuffle that broke out after Wilson told the teen and a friend to move out of the street and onto a sidewalk.

Supporters of Wilson have defended the officer's actions by saying he was threatened by Brown, who was 6-foot-4 and 300 pounds and was trying to go for the officer's gun.

Witnesses, 
including Brown's friend, told the news media that Brown had his hands 
up and was surrendering when he was gunned down. Many members of the 
community claim Brown's shooting was a cold-blooded murder.

The
 department also released details of a robbery in which video footage 
showed Brown stealing a box of cigars prior to his confrontation with 
Wilson.

His family 
released a statement in response, in which they condemned the 
information release which they said was 'intended to assassinate the 
character of their son, following such a brutal assassination of his 
person in broad daylight.'

An autopsy commissioned by Brown's family concluded that he was shot six times, twice in the head.

The new Justice Department investigation goes far beyond the circumstances of the shooting. It will look at the actions of a police department that is predominantly white even though Ferguson is about 70 per cent black.

Some in Ferguson have said police disproportionately target black motorists during traffic stops.

A 2013 report by the Missouri attorney general's office found that Ferguson police stopped and arrested black drivers nearly twice as frequently as white motorists but were also less likely to find contraband among the black drivers.

The Justice Department's civil rights division routinely investigates individual police departments when there are allegations of systemic use-of-force violations, racial bias or other problems.

The investigations sometimes end in an agreement known as a consent decree, which lays out changes that the department must make.

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson did not immediately return a call seeking comment about the investigation.

Meanwhile, it has been revealed Brown didn't face any juvenile charges at the time of his death and had never been charged with a serious felony such as murder, robbery or burglary.

Those details emerged at a hearing in which two media organizations sought the release of any possible juvenile records for Michael Brown.
