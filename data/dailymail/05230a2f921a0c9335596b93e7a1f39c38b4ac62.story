A former SAS soldier who was investigated by police after taking a piece of Saddam Hussein's toppled bronze statue has had the case dropped against him.

Officers arrested Nigel Ely after Iraqi officials claimed he had 'illegally removed cultural property'.

Now, after months of investigating the case, police have dropped it, casting doubt on the 'authenticity of its origin'.

Mr Ely, 52, from Derby, lambasted the case as a waste of time and money.

He said: 'This is ridiculous. The police 
investigation cost tens of thousands of pounds and my fees are being 
paid by legal aid. Where’s the common sense?

'The case was a complete waste of 
police time and my time. Having part of the statue of Saddam is like 
having a piece of the Berlin wall. It is a historical artifact', he told The Sun.

Mr Ely claimed he arrived in the Baghdad's Firdos Square just after the statue of Saddam
had been torn down.

He helped himself to the 2ft left buttock by using a hammer and crowbar to 
prise off the piece after American soldiers overturned the former Iraqi leader's statue in 
Baghdad in 2003.

He planned to auction it for soldiers’ charities but hid the chunk when police began investigating in January.

Iraqi leaders made a complaint via the Iraqi Embassy, claiming that the piece was part of the country's heritage.

Derbyshire police launched an investigation and arrested Mr Ely on suspicion of breaching Section 8 of the Iraqi Sanctions Order 2003 earlier this year.

Under the order, anyone possessing Iraqi cultural property must give it to the police.

Officers searched Nigel’s Herefordshire 
cottage but failed to find it. Mr Ely was released without charge.

Police now say they are not convinced the
metal is from the Saddam statue.

A spokesman for Derbyshire police said: 'Despite a thorough investigation, the 
piece alleged to be from the statue has not been recovered and we found 
evidence to cast doubt on the authenticity of its origin.

'It is disappointing that a large amount of police time and resource has
been required to investigate the claim that this item was genuine.

'If 
any new evidence comes to light, or if the item is traced and is shown 
to be genuine, further police action will be taken.'

Hussein, who had governed over Iraq 
from July 1979 until April 2003, was eventually captured and hanged in 2006 after 
being found hiding in a hole.
