Gillian Simpson, 46, is suing her parents from excluding her from the family business because of her sex change

A woman is locked in a bitter £300,000 legal dispute with relatives claiming she was forced out of the family business - after she underwent a sex change.

Gillian Denise Simpson, 46, is waging a financial battle with her parents, Graham and Glenys and her brother Gavin, for what she says is an attack on her new identity.

Miss Simpson, who was previously known as Gareth, started gender transition treatment on the NHS in 2009.

She claims her family never accepted her decision to become a woman and set out to exclude her from the family IT firm, Simtec Electronics, which operated from Mr and Mrs Simpson's home in Tarleton, Lancashire. 

But lawyers acting on behalf of the Simpson family, who are counter-suing Miss Simpson, insisted: 'This is not a gender issue.'

Speaking after the hearing at Preston County Court, a close friend of Miss Simpson, said: 'She was not allowed to wear feminine clothes or make-up and was expected to continue living as a man, regardless of the transition procedures she had been through.'

In 2011, Miss Simpson, from Tarleton, Lancashire, was said to be suffering extreme stress and was given a doctor's note to take time away from work.

But the court heard when she returned to the business premises and gave the note to her brother - an employee of the firm - he screwed it up and threw it back at her, saying: 'This is what I think of your sick note.'

Mr Simpson, who is currently listed as 'seeking a new position' on his LinkedIn page, explained his action by saying: 'I was frustrated at fielding calls from customers.' 

Miss Simpson, who has a degree in electronic engineering, started working for Simtec in 1994 - four years after the company was founded. 

In 2012, Mr and Mrs Simpson banned their daughter from the property for six months after she had her ears pierced, Preston County Court was told.

Miss Simpson, who is listed as one of the company's directors online, is now suing her family for £150,000 which she claims she lost out on after being unable to run the business when she was denied access to stock and equipment.

Her brother Gavin is counter-suing her for £19,000 of business expenses he claims were not reimbursed.

But Miss Simpson claims she did not authorise the payments and added that some items, such as Christmas decorations and a set top TU box, were for her brothers personal use.

Miss Simpson's Father, Graham, is suing his daughter for £99,000 in lost wages and her mother Glenys is claiming £66,000 of loans made to Simtec Electronics she claims have not been repaid.

Neither party would comment further when approached.

Following a five-day hearing, Judge Philip Butler reserved judgement on the case and will make a ruling on December 22.
