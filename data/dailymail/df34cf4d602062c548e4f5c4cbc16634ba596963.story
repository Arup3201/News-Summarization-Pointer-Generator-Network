Jamie O'Hara's wife Danielle has put their marital home up for sale amid claims the Wolves midfielder cheated on her with two women.

The lavish six-bedroom abode - which was
 listed on July 1 - is being billed as a 'truly remarkable modern family
 residence' on property listing website Zoopla.

And it has emerged that Danielle put the Sutton Coldfield mansion on the market for £1.9 million, just days before a second woman came forward claiming to have bedded O'Hara.

Trouble

 in paradise: Days after the news broke of Jamie O’Hara’s alleged 
affair, a second woman has now come forward to reveal she also bedded 
the footballer

The sprawling grounds are surrounded by trees for added privacy and a guest cloakroom makes the house the perfect place for entertaining friends.

The property was listed days before the news broke of Jamie O’Hara’s alleged affair, and a second woman has now come forward to claim she also bedded the footballer.

Debt collector Sarah Bailey alleges to have slept with Jamie in Los Angeles while his wife, Danielle O’Hara, was at home.

Speaking to Rachel Dale of The Sun, Sarah claimed that she was seduced by the footballer after he said he was divorced.

She alleged: ‘We had a great time. After sex we spent about an hour talking’.

After
 Jamie left the 33-year-old’s private villa, Sarah said she googled his 
name and discovered that he was in fact  still married to Danielle.

She claimed: ‘I’d  no idea who he was. He said he played football and he was divorced and I’d no reason to doubt him.'

All change: Danielle changed her Twitter profile picture to a selfie - rather than a picture of herself on her wedding day

Back to work: Jamie O'Hara returned to playing football for the Wolverhampton Wanderers on Tuesday evening

And on Tuesday, Danielle O’Hara raised further speculation that her two year marriage has come to an end after she changed her Twitter profile picture from one of her in her wedding dress to a sexy selfie.

The mother-of-three also replaced her Twitter cover photo photo, which featured her and Jamie on their big day, picking pictures of her boys instead.

While the 30-year-old was busy making changes to her social media profile, her estranged husband was also taking his mind off things.

The footballer was pictured playing for Wolves during a pre-season friendly against Hednesford Town.

MailOnline has contact representatives of Jamie and Danielle O'Hara for comment.

The day before the midfielder was seen looking somewhat downtrodden as he arrived back to his £2.3 million mansion in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, in his white Mercedes.

His wife Danielle was pictured looking equally glum as she left the house a day before.

The former Miss England is said to have left the pair's property on Sunday after reportedly 'quizzing' Jamie, 27, over claims that he slept with another woman there.

Danielle was seen driving out of the pair’s family home in her white Audi the day the news of his rumoured infidelity was reported.

Speaking to Jake Ryan of The Sun, a 
close friend admitted Danielle, 30, was devastated by the allegations: 
‘She’s distraught and just doesn’t know what to do.

‘She spent
 all day grilling Jamie for some proper answers. Danielle’s really 
worried about the effect this could have on the kids.’

The
 woman, described as a blonde in her late 20s, claimed she met Jamie and
 three pals while out with a female friend at Birmingham's Bushwhackers 
club on July 20 - and he allegedly told them that he and Danielle had 
split as he invited them to his room at the Malmaison hotel.

While
 one of the women is said to have left in disgust at the idea of a man 
cheating on his wife, the other stayed, alleging she then proceeded to 
have sex with Jamie.

'I was 
really drunk but I’m single and I admit I found him attractive,' the 
blonde later told The Sunday Mirror. 'I asked him again about his wife 
but he said "I love women, I can’t help myself."'

She
 added: ‘I know what I did was wrong. But I’m single and I was drunk and
 fancied him. He lied to me. He said they had split up. The worst thing 
is he showed no remorse.’ 

Under scrutiny: Jamie was seen making his way back to his home

Downcast:

slept with another woman there

The woman also claims that 10 of Jamie's pals listened to their bedroom encounter outside the door.She said: 'They were applauding a man with three kids for cheating on his wife.'

The 
allegations came as Danielle and Jamie – parents to sons Archie, Harry 
and George – spent the weekend helping Jamie’s dad Paul celebrate his 
birthday at picturesque Syon Park in London, where the couple exchanged 
vows during a lavish wedding ceremony in 2009.

A
 tweet, posted by Danielle on Saturday, read: ‘Spending a romantic 
weekend away at syonpark our wedding venue with my gorgeous husband 
#love.’

Family
 time: The claims have surfaced a day after Danielle uploaded a picture 
of her and Jamie celebrating her father-in-law Paul's birthday

The previous day she posted a shot of her brand new tattoo – Jamie’s name, etched into her upper back.

'Love my new tattoo dedicated to my gorgeous hubby Jamie love him so much #forever,' she wrote next to the black and white shot.

Earlier
 this year, it was claimed that she had an affair with TOWIE heart-throb
 Dan Osborne, several weeks after hitting out at accusations that she 
'kissed and fondled' Made In Chelsea star Spencer Matthews at the 
National Television Awards.

A spokesman for Danielle declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline.
