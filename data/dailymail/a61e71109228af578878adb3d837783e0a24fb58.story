A boy's devout Christian parents have lost their battle to keep him alive after a judge ruled doctors could withdraw life-support treatment despite their plea to leave the decision 'in God's hands'.

Mr Justice Ryder said it would be wrong to keep the eight-year-old alive and possibly in pain when there was no hope he would recover from lung failure.

He did acknowledge the boy's parents and teenage sister's beliefs during the ruling on Friday, after they told the High Court they were praying for a miracle and were convinced the youngster was still conscious.

Ruling: The High Court in London heard that there was no hope the eight-year-old boy would recover from lung failure

Weighing up the benefits and burdens of keeping the boy alive, Mr Justice Ryder said that 'with a heavy heart' he would rule in favour of the hospital's request to stop life-support treatment.

The court heard how the boy, who cannot be named, had been born prematurely and had undergone surgery for several holes in the heart when he was just three months old. 

He went on to live a normal life until June this year when his health deteriorated following surgery to remove a band around his pulmonary artery.

He was put onto a life-support machine which took over both his heart and lung function.

A month later, doctors saw no improvement in the boy, the court heard. His lungs remained blocked and he was heavily sedated.

Doctors also said because he was on a duel-function  'Ecmo' life-support system, the boy was more likely to develop infections and suffer pain and a painful death.

Justice Ryder said: 'It is now the view of the 
hospital team that there is no prospect of his heart or lungs recovering
and therefore no hope of survival'

The boy's mother, who asked for a sign saying 'Be strong and courageous, do not be frightened because the Lord your God goes with you' to be put above his bed, said although she accepted the medical evidence the family had not lost hope.

She said: 'Unexpected things can happen and 
because of (the boy’s) faith and my trust in God and my understanding 
that he is the one who gave him life he is the one alone who can end 
that life, I cannot agree to the lifeline of oxygen being taken away 
from him. God could intervene in a miraculous way.'

She added the family were not afraid of the boy dying but did not believe it was down to them or medical staff to decide when his life should end and how it would be a 'betrayal of trust' if they did.

The mother said the case had caused the family 'emotional trauma' adding: 'I would
plead that we might be allowed to have days without this threat hanging
over us that we may be able to spend more time with him.'

Meanwhile, the boy’s 17-year-old sister said 
her brother had told her that it was his faith that had kept him going until now.

She added the hospital's decision to switch off her brother's life support had been 'very quick'.

Clinicians made their decision to withdraw treatment last week, which prompted the boy's parents to take the hospital's application to court.

Summing up, Mr Justice Ryder said: 'I 
hope that he continues to live his life with dignity and when his life 
ends his family will understand that he lived it to the full.'
