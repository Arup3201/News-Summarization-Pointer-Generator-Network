Dr Mirza Tariq Ali, 39, who fled the country after being charged with violent disorder  has become a senior leader of the Taliban in Pakistan

A British surgeon who fled the country after being charged with violent disorder during an extremist rally has become a senior leader of the Taliban in Pakistan, it has been claimed.

Dr Mirza Tariq Ali, 39, who practised on the NHS, has appeared in a chilling recruitment video for the terrorist organisation, urging foreign jihadists to join him.

He has also edited an online English-language jihadist magazine, called 'Ihya-e-Khilafat', Revival of the Islamic Caliphate, aimed at recruiting Muslim youths from the West. 

The surgeon was convicted in the first-ever successful prosecution for Islamic sectarian violence in Britain after he was seen hitting a bystander over the head with a pole at a Central London rally in 2013. 

But he skipped bail and was found guilty in his absence at the Old Bailey and sentenced to 15 months.

He was then struck off by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) after a hearing in Manchester.

It was previously reported that he was fighting as a jihadi in Syria.

But it has now emerged that he has become a mouthpiece for a Taliban splinter-group under a new name - Dr Abu Obaidah Al-Islamabadi, according to the Sunday Telegraph.

Wearing a black turban, he was seen in a video clip, saying: 'Allah blessed me with the passion of Jihad. I left Britain with an intention to go to Iraq and join Islamic State, but I was arrested on the way and sent to prison in Croatia.'  

The extremist magazine which he helps to edit publishes contact details for  potential jihadi youths and advises them not to use  home computers which might be tracked by intelligence agencies.

In one article, Dr Tariq Ali said: 'The Muslims of Pakistan should support only those Mujahideen who are fighting to implement Shariah in Pakistan and striving to make this land a part of emerging global Khilafat (Caliphate).

'Muslims of Pakistan should save themselves from the trap of the secular government which claims to be a Muslim [government] but keeps benefiting from its alliance with Kuffar (Infidels). 

'The Muslims of Pakistan should also be aware of the misguided religious politicians who continue to paint democracy as Islamic.'

In a recent interview he revealed he was captured on his way to join the Islamic State led by Abu-Baker Al-Baghdadi in Iraq.

It is not clear where he was when he was captured, but he revealed he was jailed in Croatia. 

After his release from Croatia, Dr Tariq Ali reached Pakistan and joined the Movement of Pakistani Taliban led by Omar Khalid Khorasani.

He worked as a doctor in the Pakistani army before arriving in Britain in 2004.

The extremist then trained at a London teaching hospital and worked shifts in the capital and Cambridge. 

While based in the UK he was associated with pro-jihadist groups led by leading British Islamist Anjem Choudary. 

Police and security services are now facing embarrassing questions over how he was able to skip his bail. 

He was held twice by police and in November last year was briefly imprisoned for breaching his bail before evading the Metropolitan Police and MI5 and travelling abroad. 

Another terrorist suspect believed to have been planning a suicide bomb plot abroad fled the UK in recent months in the back of a lorry despite having his passport seized. 

The 26-year-old, of Somali origin, had known associations with terror organisations dating back to 2008 and lived a few streets away from Ed Miliband. 

David Cameron has pledged to prevent British jihadists from returning by cancelling their passports for two years.

But the case of Dr Tariq Ali highlights the damage that can be caused by extremists who evade the British justice system.
