He plays a care home resident who witnesses a violent death in his first leading TV drama role in more than 20 years.

And for Michael Palin it proved to an opportunity to reflect on how he would want to be looked after in old age – and the Monty Python star is adamant he does not want to leave his own home.

Palin, 71, plays Tom Patfitt, a frail old Yorkshireman in the upcoming BBC supernatural thriller Remember Me. His character is vulnerable and solitary among well-meaning strangers but it is not an experience Palin would wish to repeat.

Commenting on the care of the elderly and the 'connection' with their lives that they lose when placed in a home, the star said: 'My mother never went into a home. My mother-in-law, who is over 100, has not gone into a home. 

'My father was in a home for a bit, and however enlightened the people and friendly the care, I just was aware that he had lost something. 

'And I know that if I was taken away from my home to go and live somewhere else, even if I needed the treatment, a whole part of my life would have gone; my connection with the past and all the objects that I've collected. Keeping people in their own home environment for as long as possible is really important.'

Playing an old man 10 years older than him has made Palin aware of his mortality.

He told Radio Times: 'I suppose, I looked at Tom and thought, 'I'm not going to be like that'. Undoubtedly the years go by, I'm aware that I read the medical pages more carefully, follow the great statins debate and that kind of thing – but to be honest, it seems to me my life is much more enjoyable, certainly better organised, now than it was when I was young. I think I have benefited, as I approach my 70s, from the jolts and jars of earlier ages.'

The admission of Palin's character to a care home on the Yorkshire Moors triggers a string of chilling events.

Apparitions emerge, linked to his past and, on his first day at the home, he's the only witness to the mysterious death of a social worker. Palin admits it was his love of ghost stories that attracted him to the role – that and the opportunity to return to his place of birth.

'I'm not interested in the supernatural in the sense that I go to mediums and that sort of stuff. Nor have I ever seen a ghost or had any kind of psychic experience. But I'm interested just because so many other people have had these kind of experiences. I think that in a good supernatural story, the most shocking moments are not always when the ghost goes, 'Woo!' Something just happens to make you think, 'God, this is terrible'.'

He told Radio Times: 'I suppose, I looked at Tom and thought, 'I'm not going to be like that'

The three-part drama was filmed around Scarborough and Huddersfield and near where Palin was born - providing him with a chance to reminisce: 'Any excuse, I try to get back to Sheffield. I find London, where I've lived for 50 years or so, exciting, vibrant, stimulating – all those words – but it's almost as if London is so vast that you can't really get a sense of the city.

'When you're in Sheffield you can see the hills around you and there's a real sense of what Sheffield was – a big industrial city. There's a definite identity still, which goes right through all the people I know from Sheffield, rich or poor. They're proud of Sheffield, in a slightly stroppy sort of way.

'So when I go to Sheffield, I look around at the stone walls and the hills and I know where I am. Whereas in London, I feel kind of rootless.'

Scarborough, on the other hand, was 'an absolute revelation,' said Palin. 'I'm embarrassed to say it, as a Yorkshire-man, but I had only ever spent about one afternoon in this amazingly beautiful place. I keep thinking to myself that I ought to explore a bit more closer to home, because when I do go round the UK, it's really beautiful. And not to know it better is really rather shameful.'

Palin has not played a leading role in a TV drama since starring as a politically conflicted headmaster in Alan Bleasdale's GBH in 1991 in which Robert Lindsay co-starred.

Since then he has gone on to present several travel documentaries including Brazil With Michael Palin and voice Ernie in Arthur Christmas.

Palin, who is married to Helen and has three children, became a household name with the Pythons. Earlier this year he reunited with Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam and John Cleese to return to the stage for a string of Monty Python shows at London's The O2 after 30 years.

But given his age he is no longer as driven and competitive as he used to be: 'One of the great things about getting older, is that you just don't feel as competitive any more.In my 20s and 30s, I was really competitive, all the time. Now I think the work I've done, I've done. Judge it one way or the other. Now it's time to relax.'
