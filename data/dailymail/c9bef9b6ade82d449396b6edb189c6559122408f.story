Alabama police say a toddler has died after drinking from a bottle of grape soda believed to have been spiked with methadone.

31-year-old Cassie Townsend was babysitting 2-year-old Demonie Hendon Friday and noticed that a bottle containing methadone was not where she'd last placed it, Bessemer police told Al.com.

Hendon was just days away from his third birthday.

Methadone is a medication used for opioid addiction, the website explained.

Sgt. Charlie Burton told Al.com that Townsend brought the boy to a local hospital, UAB West, because he appeared to be sick.

Burton said the pair got out and traveled to a residence before going to Children's Hospital, but the boy was unresponsive and later died.

Al.com reported that Townsend was charged with chemical endangerment of a child -- before that was upgraded to chemical endangerment exposure to a child resulting in death.

It was not known if Townsend had an attorney.

Jefferson County Chief Deputy Coroner Bill Yates told the website that toxicology tests have yet to come back.

Al.com reported that March 15 Demonie would have had his third birthday.

Townsend was either the boy's godmother or aunt,  authorities told WSFA.
