Payout: Surgeon Dr Christian Head, who worked at UCLA, was depicted as a gorilla being sodomized in a slide show presentation. He will receive a $4.5million settlement after filing a racial discrimination lawsuit

A black surgeon at UCLA who was depicted as a gorilla being sodomized in a slide show presentation will receive a $4.5million settlement after filing a racial discrimination lawsuit against the university.

Dr Christian Head, 51, filed the lawsuit against the UC Board of Regents in April after claiming he was routinely publicly humiliated.

The head and neck surgeon had alleged that he was the victim of retaliation after filing complaints and claimed he was denied teaching opportunities.

The lawsuit accused the university of failing to prevent discrimination, harassment and retaliation against Head.

The complaint said that during a resident graduation event in 2006, a slide show which was created by the residents and reviewed by staff included a photo in which Head's face was superimposed onto a gorilla which was being sodomized by a department chairman.

As reported by the Los Angeles Times, the university said: 
'The case presented difficult issues of alleged discrimination and 
retaliation that were strongly contested.

'The matter was settled to the mutual satisfaction of the parties.'

In its statement, the university said 'an inappropriate slide was shown' and that it regretting the incident.

Dr Gerald Berke and Dr. Marilene Wang, who are both UCLA physicians and professors, were named in the lawsuit and accused of making 'inappropriate racial comments and insinuations about blacks' and Head for years.
