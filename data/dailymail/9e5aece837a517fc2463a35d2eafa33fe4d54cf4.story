Millennial women in America are more likely to receive pay nearly equal to their male counterparts than any previous generation.

A Pew Research study out Wednesday shows that the working women of Generation Y bring home around 93 percent of the earnings of men.

But even as the wage gap closes, women aged 18 to 32 remain as pessimistic as their mothers and grandmothers regarding gender equality.

Closing the gap? A new Pew study out Wednesday found that Millennial women are more likely to receive pay nearly equal to their male counterparts than any generation before

Overall, women earned just 84 percent of what men were paid in 2012 according to the Pew study.

Though
the younger generation is more fortunate after decades of women’s 
demands for equal pay, 75 percent of women 18-32 still say the U.S. 
needs to do more to bring about equality in the workplace.

Some 57 percent of young men answered the same way.

While
women under 32 now have higher rates of college completion than men 
that age, the analysis of census and labor data shows their hourly 
earnings will slip further behind by the women's mid-30s, if the 
experience of the past three decades is a guide.

Narrower, but still there: Pew's research shows that women 25 to 34 make 93 percent of what their male counterparts take home. Compare that to the 84 percent that woman make versus men overall

That widening gap is due in part to 
the many women who take time off or reduce their hours to start 
families. Other factors cited in the report are gender stereotyping, 
discrimination, weaker professional networks and women's hesitancy to 
aggressively push for raises and promotions, which together may account 
for 20 to 40 percent of the pay gap.

Even so, just 15 percent of young women say they have been discriminated against because of their gender.

‘Today's
generation of young women is entering the labor force near parity with 
men in terms of earnings and extremely well prepared in terms of their 
educational attainment,’ said Kim Parker, associate director with the 
Pew Social & Demographic Trends Project. ‘They feel empowered in 
many ways, yet when they look at the workplace, they see it as a 'man's 
world' with the deck stacked against them.’

‘They
think that men earn more than women for doing the same job and that 
it's easier for men to get top executive jobs than it is for women,’ she
said.

Women are 
increasingly moving into higher career positions both in government and 
business. They make up nearly half the workforce, and the share of women
in managerial and administrative occupations is nearly equal to that of
men — 15 percent compared to 17 percent.

Not out of the woods: Despite the great strides made in closing the pay gap, even Millennial women continue to be skeptical about gender equality in America--nearly as skeptical as their mothers and grandmothers

Andrew Cherlin, a sociology professor
at Johns Hopkins University, attributed young women's negative 
assessments about gender equality to their rising career expectations. 
‘More doors are now open to women, but they can now see how far they are
from equality in high-level jobs,’ he said.

The
near-equal pay for young women is being driven in large part by their 
educational gains. Some 38 percent of women ages 25-32 now hold 
bachelor's degrees, compared to 31 percent of young men. As a result, 49
percent of employed workers with at least a bachelor's degree last year
were women, up from 36 percent in 1980. That means more women in 
higher-skilled, higher-paying positions.

The
current ratio of hourly earnings for young women to young men, now at 
93 percent, is up from 67 percent in 1980 and is the highest in 
government records dating back to at least 1979. Across all age groups, 
the median hourly wage for women last year was 84 percent as much as men
— $14.90 vs. $17.79, up from 64 percent in 1980.

At
the same time, the Pew study indicates that a woman's job advancement 
often will hit a ceiling, due in part to competing demands of work and 
family. Women remain twice as likely as men to work part-time and are 
more likely to take significant time off from employment during their 
lives to care for children or other family members.

Still skeptical: While the wages are going up for Millennial women, the Pew study shows that 75 percent of women aged 18-32 think more should be done to bring about gender equality. In Boomer generation women, the number was only slightly higher

Among young women, 59 percent say that being a working parent makes it harder to advance in a job or career, compared to just 19 percent of young men. Across all age groups, 22 percent of women and 9 percent of men report having quit jobs for family reasons at some point during their working lives.

Fewer young women than young men aspire to become a boss or top manager. Some 34 percent say they're not interested, compared to 24 percent of young men. And the vast majority of adults of all ages who reduced their work hours to care for family members — 94 percent — say they are glad they did it.

‘This report shows that we are still very much in a 'stalled revolution' when it comes to gender equality in the workplace — and young women see it,’ said Pamela Smock, a sociology professor at the University of Michigan. ‘When we see our male CEOs taking off a day to care for a sick child, then we will be working in a more gender-equal workplace — and a more gender-equal world.’

The Pew study was based on interviews with 2,002 adults by cellphone or landline from October 7 to October 27. The Pew poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.7 percentage points.
