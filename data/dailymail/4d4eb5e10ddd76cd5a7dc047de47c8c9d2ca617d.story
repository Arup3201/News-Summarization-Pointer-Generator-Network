She was dubbed 'The Girl on the Dancing Horse' and became a poster girl for the London Olympic Games after a breathtaking dressage display last summer.

But fast-forward a year and Charlotte Dujardin is taking some much-needed downtime on holiday in Barbados.

The double Olympic gold medalist showed off her toned body in a bikini while on the sun-drenched beach with fiance Dean Golding.Â

The 28-year-old British rider has Tweeted about how much they have enjoyed the scenery and hospitality in the Caribbean.

'Been great to learn about this lovey country,' she wrote, adding 'only a couple more days left in paradise... Dean and I are loving it. May never leave.'

Although the draw of her beloved horse Valegro, also known as Blueberry, will make her return home easier as she also Tweeted how much she was missing him.

'Had a brilliant night @CliffBarbados what a beautiful place. Missing Blueberry though,' she wrote.

Many commentators have spoken of the 'telepathic' relationship both horse and rider seem to share when competing.

Thanks to their stellar performances last summer, 
Dujardin joined Kelly Holmes, Rebecca Adlington and Laura Trott in an 
exclusive club of British female athletes to win two Olympic titles at 
one Games.

Enfield-born 
Dujardin dominated London 2012's equestrian programme, winning team and 
individual dressage gold.

Speaking at the time, she said: 'It's
a bit of a surreal feeling. I think it will probably take a few weeks 
for it all to sink in,

'This
has all been the most unbelievable experience. From the moment I got 
here until the day I leave London, it has just been incredible.

'We haven't had to worry about anything, and it has just enabled us to enjoy it so, so much.

'I've had such a fantastic opportunity 
to be able to have a horse like Valegro to ride at my first Olympics, a 
trainer like Carl and a team as great as we've had. It has made it very 
special.'

But she hasn't rested on her laurels following her Olympic success, as this year she won gold again in the freestyle and individual dressage at the European Championships and is world number one in the dressage rankings.

She was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to equestrianism.
