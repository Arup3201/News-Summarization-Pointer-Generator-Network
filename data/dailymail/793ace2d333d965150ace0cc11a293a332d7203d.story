It was the dream home of millionaire Segway boss Jimi Heselden but it's up for sale for £4.5m, three years after he died in a freak scooter accident on the edge of his estate.

The 62-year-old plunged 42ft from a cliff while out walking his dog on a rough terrain Segway in September 2010.

His inquest heard that he was probably giving way to another walker and got into difficulty.

He was reported to have a fortune of £166 million at his death, making him one of the 400 richest people in the UK.

Mr Heselden had bought the European 
licence for the Segway a few years before, but was better known as the 
owner of Hesco Bastion, which builds containers used to protect troops 
around the world.

Camp Bastion in Afghanistan is named after his firm. He left a wife, Julie, and four grown-up children.
