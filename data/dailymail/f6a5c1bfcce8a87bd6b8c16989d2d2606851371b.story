A tap water ban in West Virginia is slowly being lifted on Monday as officials fear the system could be overwhelmed after hundreds of thousands of people went five days without clean water.

Some 300,000 residents of Charleston had their tap water poisoned last Thursday when company Freedom Industries' alleged
shoddy safety practices led to a chemical spill into the water supply. 

It has also emerged that Freedom Industries has worked largely without regulation or 
environmental inspection for more than two decades.

Governor Earl Tomblin told a news conference on Monday that the ban is being lifted in a strict, methodical manner to help ensure the water system isn't overwhelmed by excessive demand, which could cause more water quality and service issues.

Workers inspect an area near the Elk River where a chemical leaked at Freedom Industries storage facility in Charleston, West Virgina into the water supply

West Virginia Governor Earl Ray Tomblin told a press conference today that a ban on the water supply was gradually being lifted so that the system would not be overwhelmed

Customers were asked to flush out 
their systems before using the water again. Officials cautioned the 
water could still have an odor, but they said it was safe.

Over
 the weekend, water tests reportedly showed that levels of the 
licorice-smelling chemical  4-methylcyclohexane methanol were 
consistently below a toxic threshold, and in some samples, there was no 
trace of the substance at all.

However one homeowner showed just how toxic and flammable the water still was on Sunday by setting on fire a glass poured from his kitchen tap.

Questions
 were now being raised as to how and why the leak occurred and whether Freedom Industries took too long to let state officials 
know about the problem.

Work continues around a storage tank with the chemical designation MCHM,  4-methylcyclohexane methanol, the chemical that leaked into the Elk River, at Freedom Industries storage facility in Charleston

The facility largely flew under the radar of government 
regulators who viewed it as a low-risk operation - but in reality, a 
problem at a key holding wall went undetected and unreported at Freedom 
Industries Inc.

The chemicals stored at Freedom's facility near the Elk River are not considered hazardous enough by regulators to prompt routine inspections.

As a result, the chemical storage terminal was a low priority for regulators, who must pick and choose how to allocated scarce manpower when enforcing environmental laws.

'I think that the loophole that this facility fell into is because it was not a hazardous material, it flew under the radar,' said Randy Huffman, cabinet secretary of West Virginia's Department of Environmental Protection, which enforces environmental laws.

Before the chemical leak last week, environmental inspectors had not visited the Freedom Industries site since 1991, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Freedom's storage terminal holds millions of pounds of chemicals - including some used in coal processing - just a mile and a half upstream from pipes that take in water for a public drinking supply. The distance left little opportunity for chemicals to dilute in the event of a spill.

And those chemicals were stored behind a brick-and-concrete block dike that seems to have had structural problems - an issue the company apparently was aware of.

A state official says the president told regulators that Freedom had put $1 million into an escrow account to fix the wall that ultimately failed to hold Thursday's spill.

State environmental officials would not have seen the dike problems - they say they never had reason to inspect the site.

Although regulators never visited, it appears company officials were aware of issues with the containment dike.

Freedom Industries President Gary Southern told state regulators that $1 million was put into an escrow account to repair the wall, said Mike Dorsey, the DEP's director of emergency response and homeland security. Company officials have not returned calls seeking comment on the condition of the dike.

'The wall is an old cement block wall, and there's some problems with the mortar in a couple places, Dorsey said. 'And it came out through that.'

A resident of Charleston, West Virginia sent a glass of tap water on fire to show the level of toxicity from a chemical contamination

A Charleston couple conducted a water experiment where they were able to set it on fire following its contamination with 4-methylcyclohexane methanol - which is used to clean coal

During the water ban, some people had put plastic bags 
around faucets so that they will be reminded not to use the water while 
others left town to take a shower and find an open restaurant.

Water
 distribution centers handed out bottled water and trucks with large 
tanks of water filled up containers for people to take home.

So far, only ten people exposed to 
the contaminated water were admitted to the hospital, and none were in 
serious condition, Health and Human Resources Secretary Karen Bowling 
said.

The chemical, even in 
its most concentrated form, isn't deadly. However, people were told they
 shouldn't even wash their clothes in affected water, as the compound 
can cause symptoms ranging from skin irritation and rashes to vomiting 
and diarrhea.

Other
 than schools, day-care centers, hotels and many restaurants were still closed on Monday, the region was open for business but foot traffic was
 slow.

Stores and 
offices adjusted by providing bottled water and hand sanitizer. State government offices were open on Monday.

Erin Brockovich, who helped the illness-plagued town of Hinkley, California win $300,000,000 after a chemical company poisoned their drinking water announced she will lend her expertise in West Virginia

The contamination disaster began with a
 smell last Thursday when residents of Charleston began to complain of a
 licorice-like aroma in the air, one that seemed most potent near the 
town's water treatment plant.

For
 an unknown period, a chemical called 4-methylcyclohexane methanol used 
in the Mountain State's prevalent coal industry had been gushing into 
the Elk River, a waterway from which West Virginia's largest water 
treatment plant sources its water.

About 7,500 gallons of the chemical are believed to have leaked into the water supply from a one-inch hole in a storage tank.

Lawyer
 Erin Brockovich, famous for her class-action suits which target the corrupt
 practices of big business, announced on her website last week that 
she and her team are headed to Charleston, to investigate the cause and 
possible implications of the chemical spill at 
Freedom Industries.

Coal miner's widow Bonnie Wireman of Dry Branch, West Virginia made clear that she did not blame the coal or chemical industries for the spill

'When things like this happen, we respond accordingly,' Ms Brockovich told The West Virginia Record.

'People have contacted us who are concerned, and itâ€™s certainly a 
scenario that concerns us. I mean, there are 300,000 people without 
water right now.'

After
 fixing the immediate problem of finding drinking water, Brockovich said
 it must be determine what lasting affects West Virginia's leak will 
have on its children, ecosystem and wildlife.

It's
 the same process she took beginning in 1993 when she began her quest in
 Hinkley, California where Pacific Gas and Electric helped sicken an 
entire town following a serious and subsequently concealed release of 
dangerous Chromium 6 into the town well water.

The
 detrimental health effects of chromium 6 are well studied, however the 
compound the poured into the West Virginia river last week is not nearly
 as well understood, especially at the extreme levels released during 
the leak
