Discovery: Eva Braun who married Adolf Hitler just days before they committed suicide

As the Red Army smashed into the suburbs of Berlin in April 1945, the mood of Hitler’s bride-to-be Eva Braun turned from fragile hope to black despair.

Letters she is said to have written from the bunker hideout she shared with the Fuhrer and his henchmen reveal her growing sense of doom.

In one, dated April 19, she writes that, despite the thud of artillery and falling bombs, she is ‘happy to be close’ to Hitler and remains ‘convinced that everything will turn out all right’.

But three days later, as Soviet troops overwhelm the German capital’s exhausted defence force – many of them old men and boys – her mood has changed. She says: ‘We are fighting here until the last but I’m afraid the end is threatening closer and closer.’

She also writes of preparing to die and her bewilderment at how God could let such things happen.

Eight days later, 33-year-old Braun was dead, killing herself alongside her husband of only a few hours, Adolf Hitler.

The letters are published this week in a book called The Women of the Nazis, by Third Reich expert Anna Maria Sigmund.

The writer, whose books have been translated into more than 30 languages, insists the letters are genuine and were written by Braun to her friend Herta Schneider.

‘I have no doubt that the letters are genuine and Eva Braun has typed them, correcting her faults by hand,’ she said.

She claims the descendants of Schneider, who died nearly 20 years ago, showed her the letters. She said she copied them down before they were sold on to a collector.

In the second letter Braun says: ‘Greetings to all my friends, I’m dying how I’ve lived. It’s not difficult for me. You know that.’

Claims: A book published in Germany this week claims to have discovered the farewell letters of Hitler's bride Eva Braun which she wrote to her friend days before committing suicide

Final days: The bunker where Hitler spent his final days with his new wife Eva Braun

Demise: Eva Braun's sentiments change from positive to morbid in the letters

Anna Maria Sigmund explained: ‘Eva 
Braun reflects the change of mood in the Fuhrerbunker over four days – 
the vague hope on the 19th and the despair of April 22.’

Thirty
 years ago the news magazine Stern in Germany became a laughing stock 
when it published diaries which it claimed were Hitler’s.

They were exposed within days as the work of a master forger.

Mrs
 Sigmund said she is, however, convinced of the authenticity of the 
letters – and of the ‘normality’ of the relationship between Hitler and 
Eva. ‘I think they had a pretty normal love and sex life,’ she added.

Denied: Hitler kept Eva's existence secret from the German people during his rule, believing that the myth that he was 'married' to the nation would serve him better

Braun
 married Hitler just 40 hours before the pair died by taking cyanide. 
Hitler also shot himself in the head. She had been his partner for 
several years despite him being more than 20 years older than her. They 
met when Braun was just 17.

Hitler
 kept Eva’s existence secret from the German people during his rule, 
believing that the myth that he was ‘married to the nation’ would serve 
him better.

She was introduced only to his inner circle at his Alpine retreat in Berchtesgaden and in his Berlin apartment.

Losing hope: Anna Maria Sigmund explained: 'Eva Braun reflects the change of mood in the Führerbunker over four days - the vague hope on the 19th and the despair of April 22.'

Last day: Adolf Hitler and his wife Eva Braun pose with their pets. The dictator is holding his favourite dog Blondi on a leash. He was to have her poisoned with cyanide

He
 met her when she worked as an assistant to Heinrich Hoffmann, the 
Munich photographer who went on to become the Fuhrer’s personal 
cameraman.

A diary of Hitler’s close confidant and ideologue, Alfred Rosenberg, has been recovered.

The
 log could offer an insight into meetings Rosenberg had with the Nazi 
leader and his henchmen, including Heinrich Himmler and Herman Goering.

His
 diary was held by US prosecutors at the Nuremberg war crime trials of 
late 1945 and has now been recovered by the US government.

He was convicted at Nuremberg of crimes against humanity and hanged in 1946.
