Amazon is launching a new same day pick up service allowing customers who order before 11.45am to pick up their parcels from local newsagents from 4pm

Amazon is launching a new attack on traditional high street stores from today with its first ever same day pick-up service.

Shoppers who order an item before 11.45am  will be able to collect it from 4pm onwards at any one of 500 named newsagents and convenience stores.

The new ‘Pass My Parcel’ service will initially be free to subscribers to the Amazon Prime service, while others will have to pay £4.99.

Traditional bricks and mortar stores have been under unprecedented attack from web retailers, who have been able to undercut them on price because they have much lower costs.

Until now, the high street has had one key advantage in that shoppers could make an instant purchase, while people using the web had the expense and delay involved in waiting for a delivery.

However, Amazon believes it has been able to overcome this hurdle with the same day service.

Workers who need something urgently, perhaps a birthday present for a loved one, will be sure they arrive home with the item without having to leave their desks to browse the shops.

There is also an ‘Express Morning’ service which will  allow shoppers to order an item at any time up to 7.45pm in the evening with the option of picking it up at some time between 6am and 9am the following morning.

It might be a new dress or tie for an important business meeting or essentials needed for a sunshine holiday.

Customers are notified by email when the item is ready for collection and they are given a unique code which authorises the store to hand it over.

The service is being offered in a collaboration with Smiths News and will utilise its fleet of vans which normally deliver newspaper and magazines to tens of thousands of retailers across the UK.

Initially, the Amazon same day service will be available from 500 stores which will carry the ‘Pass My Parcel’ banner in their shop windows, but it is likely to be rolled out to many more.

Amazon already offers shoppers the option to collect purchases from any one of 6,000 points, including stores carrying the Collect + logo and secure Amazon Lockers, but orders generally take a day or so to fulfil.

It is thought the move could draw more customers away from the high street and into online shopping

Christopher North, Amazon’s UK managing director, said: ‘This is our fastest pick-up service yet.

‘We know that Prime customers love fast delivery and the convenience to pick up their order at a time and place that suits them best. This new service brings together both of those great benefits.’

He added: ‘We have recently added Birmingham International Airport and a number of London tube stations to our ever-expanding list of pick-up locations.

‘Our intention is to keep rapidly adding to the many thousands of existing pick-up locations to ensure that customers all over the UK are provided with as much choice as possible when it comes to the delivery of their Amazon order.’

Mark Cashmore, Group Chief Executive, of Connect Group, said: ‘We are delighted to be working with Amazon at the launch of Pass my Parcel.

‘Because we visit thousands of local retailers every day, we are uniquely placed to deliver a twice daily pick up service that is second to none in speed and convenience.’

The online firm will despatch parcels from one of its warehouse centres to any of 500 newsagents around the country from today

The same day collection service will be free to subscribers to Amazon Prime, which costs £79 a year, until the end of this year. Prime members also get free one-day delivery on over seven million items, access to 500,000 Kindle books to borrow and unlimited streaming of more than 15,000 movies and TV episodes through Prime Instant Video.

The ability to offer same day delivery is the Holy Grail for web stores. In the USA, the company has launched the AmazonFresh in some cities, which offers the same day delivery of fresh and frozen groceries.

There are long-standing rumours that the company wants to bring the service to this country. The vice president of Amazon UK is Doug Gurr, who previously ran Asda’s food home shopping service. He has hinted at the expansion of AmazonFresh, saying: ‘We have just started rolling that out across America.

‘Our model tends to be to take something and to try really hard to make it work and then, when we think we have got it right, start rolling it out.’

This week Google announced it is expanding a delivery service for online purchases in the USA which is called ‘Google Express’.

Google will charge $10 a month, or $95 a year, for unlimited same-day or overnight delivery on orders over $15. Non-members will pay $4.99 an order, or $7.99 if the order costs less than $15.

Google Express, lets customers place orders online for products from physical stores run by retailers including Costco , Staples and Walgreen. The service, which initially covered parts of San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York is being extend to Washington, D.C., Boston and Chicago.
