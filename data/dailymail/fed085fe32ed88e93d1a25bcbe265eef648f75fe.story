From international leaders to film stars and royalty, the Royal Yacht Britannia has seen more glamorous occasions than most.

But since retiring to a quiet mooring in Edinburgh, the glittering occasions have been thin on the ground.

That, however, is all about to change. For the ship's 60th anniversary, visitors will be invited to come aboard dressed in the glamorous finery of the 50s - the decade when the ship was launched.

Glamour: During her 696 visits to far flung climes, Britannia has seen more than her fair share of glitz

Halcyon days: The ship was launched on the 16th April 1953 but her maiden voyage was the following year

The vintage fashion parade will take place on the 13th and 14th April, and will kick off a week of celebrations, during which ship-goers will have the chance to win some suitably sophisticated pink Britannia champagne.

Along with champagne, there will also be a birthday cake to enjoy, and the week of celebration will culminate in a fireworks display over the harbour on the 20th April.

Britannia was launched by the Queen on 16th April 1953 but didn't officially come into service until the 11th January the following year.

The ship's maiden voyage took her from Portsmouth to the capital of Malta, Valetta, arriving on the 22nd April 1954.

On board were Princess Anne and Prince Charles who visited Valetta before going onto Tobruk in Libya, where they were joined by the Queen and Prince Philip at the end of the royal couple's Commonwealth Tour.

During her career, Britannia clocked up 696 foreign visits and 272 visits in British 
waters, steaming a grand total of 1,087,623 nautical miles 
(2,014,278 km) over 44 years.

The yacht was also intended to be a refuge for the Queen in the case of a nuclear attack, according to historian, Peter Hennessy.

'It was her floating nuclear bunker,' he revealed. 'It would lurk in the sea lochs on the north-west coast of Scotland; the mountains would shield it from the Soviet radar and at night it would go quietly from one sea loch to another.'

Britannia was eventually decommissioned in 1997 under the Tony Blair government, much to the distress of the Queen who famously shed a rare public tear as she waved the yacht goodbye.

Now moored in Edinburgh's Port of Leith, the yacht has become a hugely popular tourist attraction, bringing in upwards of 250,000 visitors a year.
