He is famous for his 'matchstick men' drawings of industrial scenes in northern England.

But early art school drawings that have been discovered after 100 years show that LS Lowry was also talented at classical drawing.

The 70 sketches made up Lowry’s portfolio of work while at Salford College in Manchester in the early 20th century.

The drawings by LS Lowry before finding his 'matchstick men' style he became famous for have been discovered after 100 years

70 sketches made up Lowry's portfolio of work while at Salford College in Manchester in the early 20th century

The drawings are more classical than his later works. He is famous for his 'matchstick men' style

Many of them are life studies of men and
women dressed in Victorian outfits while there is also a charming 
drawing of a sleeping fox that Lowry named Freddie.

The work is more classical compared to the paintings of industrial scenes featuring matchstick people he went on to establish.

Laurence Stephen Lowry gifted the sketch book to the owner of his local corner grocery shop in Manchester in the 1950s.

After his death, his widow gave it to a woman who cared for her later in life. It was inherited by the carer’s son and he is now selling it for an estimated £20,000.

The owner, Brian Moston-Dunbar, 63, from Birmingham, said: 'They are very competent drawings by somebody who was clearly a good draughtsman.

'They are from Lowry’s art college days and are life models and male and female studies.

'One of the drawings is of Freddie the Fox who Lowry used to feed in his garden as a child. In the 1950s he used this drawing to show budding artists how it was done.

'Everybody associates the matchstick figures with Lowry but without learning these basics he couldn’t possibly progress to doing very good stylised things.

Laurence Stephen Lowry is best known for urban landscapes peopled with human figures often referred to as 'matchstick men'

'Lowry used to be good friends with the owners of his local corner shop and gave them an oil painting which is now untraceable and this book of sketches.

'My mother was friends with the woman who owned the store and she later gave her the book.

'Mum must have squirreled them away.

'When she moved to sheltered accommodation she gave quite a lot of stuff to me. I took very little notice of the work at first because I didn’t realise they were by him as they aren’t matchstick men.'

Most of the sketches are A4 size and some are detached from the sketchbook.The auction takes place in September.
