A heavily polluted Paris was plunged into traffic chaos today as police handed out fines to drivers for using their cars illegally.

A new policy introduced today means drivers in the French capital can only use their cars every other day - alternating for cars with odd and even number plates - in a bid to make the air cleaner.

The drastic measure follows a grey smog settling over the French capital from the middle of last week.

Some 700 extra officers were out on the street to man 60 checkpoints ensuring that only cars and motor bikes with number plates ending in odd numbers were out on the streets.

Restrictions: Parisians can only use their cars every other day under new rules introduced in an attempt to reduce air pollution in the city

The driving restriction alternates between cars with even and odd licence plate numbers

Out in force: An extra 700 police officers were deployed to enforce the new restrictions

The checkpoints caused traffic jams across the capital as many drivers decided to risk a fine and drive their car despite the restrictions

But by late morning it soon became clear that many were happy to risk a fine equivalent to £18, rather than to take overcrowded public transport.

‘It’s taken me up to two hours to get into town, around three times what it normally takes,’ said sales representative Jerome Thomas, as he sat in gridlocked traffic close to the Eiffel Tower.

‘The police are stopping people, which causes huge delays – at this rate the pollution will be far worse than before because vehicles are spending longer on the road.’

Electric and hybrid cars were exempt from the ban, as well as any vehicle carrying three people or more, but many still only had one person on board.

‘Plenty of fines are being handed out, but we’ve no indication of precise figures yet,’ said a traffic police spokesman. ‘This is an exceptional measure.’

Pollution is believed to be lingering because of a combination of bright sunny days and cold nights, say experts.

Environmentalists fear air pollution is currently rivalling notoriously dirty cities such as the Chinese capital, Beijing, and Mexico City.

The Eiffel Tower, is barely seen through the smog from Paris. Emissions from the French capital could be blown over by strong south easterly winds until Friday, according to the Met Office

Pollution levels have reached 180 
microgrammes of PM10 particulates per cubic metre, more than double the 
safe limit of 80. PM10 particulates are emitted by heating systems and 
heavy industry, as well as by vehicles.

A
 spokesman for France’s transport ministry said: ‘Pollution levels will 
be monitored throughout the week to see if the driving restrictions will
 continue.’

Foreigners 
driving through Paris, including many Britons, will not be prevented 
from using their cars during today’s ban, which lasts from 5.30am until 
midnight.

Up to 700 traffic policemen will be drafted into the city to make sure the severe restrictions are enforced
