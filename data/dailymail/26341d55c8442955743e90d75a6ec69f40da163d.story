Thousands of soldiers, many still serving in the deadly war zones of Afghanistan, will be laid off as the Pentagon enforces mandatory spending cuts.

Fox News reports that roughly 2,600 captains and other officers will receive 'pink slip' letters with even more expected to be let go after that.

The controversial move is part of a larger plan to reduce the number of U.S. soldiers from 520,000 to 450,000, said Defense Department officials.

The decision to lay off soldiers in active combat has been called not only bad for morale but outright dangerous.

'It puts the soldier, the soldier's family and the men under his command at risk,' said retired Major Gen. Robert Scales, who is now a Fox News contributor. 'Young officers look at each other and wonder who is next.'

The plan has been defended as 'a balanced approach that maintains readiness while trying to minimize turbulence within the officer corps,' by military officials.

However the announcement also came under fire from Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe, a top Republican member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

'Once again [President Obama] is 
putting domestic politics ahead of the security of our nation,' eh said. 'The Army 
captains and majors receiving pink slips while on the battlefield is 
just the latest example.

'My heart goes out to these men and women who are risking their lives
 and making great sacrifices, yet are now being told they are being 
separated from the Army and will have no job when they return home to 
their families.'

A report in USA Today earlier this year when Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced the cuts noted that 'tens of thousands' of military personnel could be let go in the coming years.

Similar reductions were made after the war in Vietnam, but unlike that conflict military action in Iraq and Afghanistan has been carried out by relatively small armies composed entirely of volunteers.

Surveys showed that approximately one in three middle class military families are now worried about their job security, a jump from one in four in the summer of 2013.

'Everybody who's getting looked at right now ... has to really start 
thinking about, 'Well, what if?'' Army Maj. Timothy Hyde, a married 
and the father of two, told reporters in February upon learning his job was in danger.

'I'll be disappointed if I get 
selected for early separation,' Hyde said. 'But I have my faith and my family to fall back on.'
