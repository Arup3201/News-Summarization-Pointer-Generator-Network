Under scrutiny: Rebekah Brooks has faced a 'witch hunt' resembling a medieval show trial, her lawyer told the phone hacking trial yesterday

Rebekah Brooks has faced a ‘witch hunt’ resembling a medieval show trial, her lawyer told the phone hacking trial yesterday.

The former News International chief executive has been subjected to public revulsion over accusations she presided over a six-year conspiracy to hack phones, including hacking the voicemails of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, the Old Bailey was told.

During her seven-month trial the 45-year-old’s actions have been examined and scrutinised ‘in a way which may well be unprecedented in the history of British justice,’ her lawyer Jonathan Laidlaw QC said.

Mr Laidlaw said she had been given a fair trial but said the prosecution’s attitude towards her had ‘at times been that of a witch hunt’.

In his final remarks to the jury, the lawyer likened her treatment at the hands of prosecutor Andrew Edis QC to a ‘medieval show trial’ where a woman accused of witchcraft would be tied to a ducking stool, and acquitted if she drowned but burned at the stake as a witch if she survived.

He said: ‘Just as in a medieval show trial you could tell a true witch when she floated, so Mr Edis will interpret every piece of evidence about Mrs Brooks - everything she says and everything anyone else says about her - as a sign of guilt, regardless of its true meaning.

‘If Mrs Brooks writes an email to a member of her staff instructing that person to act lawfully, to make sure everything they do is 110 percent justified, right and proper, it only goes to show she knew they were up to no good in the first place.

‘If she comes across as a nice person in the witness box, it’s only a cunning mask. If she makes you laugh, it’s only because she’s telling you lies.

‘If her evidence makes sense it’s only because it is carefully scripted.’

Such lies in her evidence would be ‘cynical perjury’, Mr Laidlaw said, and urged the jury to ignore public revulsion over the News of the World’s hacking of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler.

He told the eight women and three men: ‘There are those who love her [Brooks] deeply but she’s become, since Milly Dowler, a controversial figure and many people hate her.’ 

Brooks, a married mother-of-one, denies she knew about phone hacking at the now defunct Sunday tabloid, including the targeting of the murdered schoolgirl’s voicemail messages in 2002.

Mr Laidlaw said the prosecution had itself called a witness who had deliberately lied to the jury.

Tragic: Brooks allegedly presided over the hacking of the voicemails of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler

He said Eimear Cook, the ex-wife of golfer Colin Montgomerie, had told a ‘bare-faced lie’ when she gave evidence that Brooks had joked about her own arrest for an alleged assault on her former husband, EastEnders actor Ross Kemp, and had admitted a story in the News of the World had come from hacking.

In fact Brooks was not arrested over the alleged assault until three months after the episode Mrs Cook described so the conversation could not have happened.

Mr Laidlaw said: ‘There’s simply no possibility Mrs Cook has got it wrong by mistake. She was lying.’ 

Prosecutors and police were so eager to include her evidence as a ‘coup’ in their case against Brooks that they failed to carry out basic checks which would have proved it was false, he told the court.

‘Perhaps they took Mrs Cook entirely at face value. She’s an affluent ex-wife of a famous golfer, well-spoken, apparently credible, why test her account? Perhaps they didn’t want to.

‘She was certainly an important witness in the prosecution case but she was a liar,’ Mr Laidlaw said.

He suggested Mrs Cook could have been motivated by a personal vendetta or grudge against Brooks or could have hoped to win more compensation from News International in her civil case as a victim of phone hacking.

Brooks denies plotting to hack phones and commit misconduct by making allegedly corrupt payments to a public official for information while she was editor at The Sun.

The information led to stories which had exposed wrongdoing in the Army which the Ministry of Defence had attempted to cover up, Mr Laidlaw said, including a recruit seriously injured in an attack by his drill sergeant.

The lawyer said Brooks had been painted as ‘the arch criminal’ who had sanctioned hacking and misconduct and then involved her husband Charlie Brooks, her PA and News International’s head of security in another plot to hide evidence from police.

He said she had faced ‘profound anger’ over the closure of the News of the World in 2011, but added: ‘Not one former colleague, not one disgruntled reporter has come forward to say she had anything to do with phone hacking.’ 

Brooks denies conspiring to hack phones, commit misconduct and pervert the course of justice.

All the defendants in the case, including her former lover Andy Coulson, who later became David Cameron’s director of communications in Downing Street, deny all the accusations against them.

The trial continues.
