Professor Stephen Hawking has received a major communications system upgrade that has doubled the speed of his speech and allows him to write ten times quicker.

The physicist said the new technology will allow him to continue to write and give lectures, as well as communicate more effectively with friends and family. 

He assured fans, though, that his trademark synthesised voice will remain the same despite the up-rated technology.

The physicist said he can now communicate quicker with his new system - but keeps his distinctive voice

The Cambridge University professor, whose work has revolutionised the way scientists view time and space, said: 'We are here to talk about how science and technology is improving the lives of people with disabilities.

‘We are pushing the boundaries of what is possible through technology - without it I would not be able to speak to you today.

‘Intel’s research and development is bringing about changes in the world and in the way that disabled people can communicate.

‘The Intel team and I have been working together for almost three years on upgrading my communication system.

‘My old system is more than 20 years old and I was finding difficult to continue to communicate effectively, and to do the things I love to do.

‘With the improvements made, I am now able to write much faster, and it means that I can continue to give lectures, write papers and books and, of course, speak with my family and friends more easily. This new system is life changing for me, and I hope it will serve me well for the next 20 years.’

Prof Hawking, who appeared in an episode of The Simpsons, said his new technology was being made freely available so other people with life-changing disabilities will be able to benefit from the three-year project 

The software learns the words and phrases used by Prof Hawking, enabling him to type and speak quicker using the infra-red sensor on his glasses and the movement of his cheek. 

Prof Hawking suffers from a form of motor neurone disease which has left him almost paralysed. 

The new equipment is called ACAT (Assistive Context Aware Toolkit). 

It uses special software designed by British company SwiftKey - similar to those on smartphones, which is able to select words after inputting just 10-15 per cent of the letters. This reduces the effort and time required to communicate. 

Professor Hawking said the technology he helped develop will be made freely available early next year to help other people with motor neurone disease, quadriplegia and other disabilities. 

He added: 'By making this technology freely available it has the
potential to greatly improve the lives of disabled people all
over the world.'
