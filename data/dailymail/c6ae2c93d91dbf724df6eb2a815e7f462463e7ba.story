A former offshore processing official says refugee advocates are encouraging asylum seekers in Australia's immigration detention centres to self harm so the advocates can use the incidents for their own political agenda.

Greg Lake told Mailonline a handful of 'extreme' refugee campaigners coached 'ringleaders' in detention centres who stood over more vulnerable asylum seekers, forcing them to sew their lips together, make suicide attempts and harm themselves to gain publicity for the advocates' cause.

'Then these advocates are ready with a media release to promote their cause,' he said, 'they often know about the incident before the minister or the department does and that's because they organised it.'

He said the practice was confined to a minority of advocates, but that it was 'despicable'.

'Despicable' acts: Whistleblower Greg Lake, a former immigration department manager on Nauru, says that a small number of 'extremist' refugee advocates are coaching ringleaders in island detention centres to induce vulnerable asylum seekers to self harm all for the political agenda of refugee campaigners back in Australia

'I'm not saying this is the majority of advocates - most refugee advocates are genuinely interested in giving a voice to the voiceless and making people aware of the circumstances around asylum seekers.

'However there are some who do and I am sure that this is what happened before the violent protest on Manus Island which resulted in the death of Reza Berati.'

'In reality there is a lot of self harm by detainees in immigration detention centres which is due to mental health issues which they experience while in detention.

'But some high profile advocates are using people to prey on the more vulnerable among them to lip sewing and other harming activities.'

Mr Berati was killed on February 17 during a riot inside the Manus Island detention centre in Papua New Guinea.

Political agenda: Greg Lake (pictured) says that while most refugee advocates genuinely care about giving refugees a voice, but that an unscrupulous few entice ringleaders to stand over more vulnerable asylum seekers, forcing them to sew their lips together, make suicide attempts and harm themselves to gain publicity for the advocates' cause

The 23-year-old Iranian allegedly died after he was beaten with a wooden stick and kicked, before being hit on the head with a rock, during a confrontation between detainees and PNG locals in which 62 people were injured.

Mr Lake is a former Department of Immigration regional manager who once worked in Nauru detention centre. He resigned in December 2012 and has since been critical of both sides in the immigration and asylum seeker debate.

Greg Lake said the actions of the extremist refugee advocates were 'at odds with their mandate'.

He was responding to questions about a claim by the Refugee Action Coalition that ten women in detention on Christmas Island had attempted suicide this week so that their orphaned babies might be brought up in Australia.

The Australian reported the Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul had 'backed down' from his earlier claimed that '10 mothers in the family camp have attempted suicide in the last two days on Christmas Island'.

The newspaper quoted Mr Rintoul as saying he 'probably shouldn't have said attempted suicide' because 'people drinking concoctions of shampoo or detergent generally don’t die — was it a drastic cry for help? Yes, it was, and it remains that way'.

Mr Rintoul told Mailonline that his apparent 'backdown' was nothing of the sort and had arisen out of a discussion about how the incident should have been reported.

'I am not resiling from what took place and that is self harm,' he told Mailonline.

'There are degrees of self harm. Some people slash their stomachs, some people drink concoctions.

'They drank shampoo, cut themselves, attempted to cut themselves. Drinking shampoo can kill you.

'Probably if I'd said ten women were self harming, there isn't any distinction between self harming and suicide.'

Christmas Island: Claims of women attempting suicide in Christmas Island detention centre this week so that their orphaned children could become residents of Australia appear to have been exaggerated. The island which lies in the Indian Ocean 2600km northwest of Perth attracts boats like the vessel pictured off the island's Flying Fish Cove in August, 2011, from nearby neighbouring countries such as Indonesia

The detention centre on Christmas Island (above) opened in 2001 and now houses more than 1200 asylum seekers who arrived on boats from Indonesia and other neighbouring countries

Mr Rintoul denied encouraging individuals to self harm for his own political agenda.

'It's the system which encourages self harm,' he said, 'it breeds anxiety.

'I don't know individuals who actually self harmed. I do know some of the families. I got calls after the event.'

Mr Rintoul said it was impossible for him or other advocates to call into detention centres, but that detainees could call them.

He said Mr Lake's claims about advocates coaching detainees to self harm was 'sheer fantasy'.

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has denied the claims that mothers had attempted suicide on Christmas Island so their children could gain Australian residency.

Up to 14 female asylum seekers on self-harm watch were being monitored by female staff, Christmas Island shire councillor Gordon Thomson told AAP

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison is advised female staff are on hand to help women placed on watch when they are undertaking 'personal care tasks'.The level of monitoring varies, depending on the individual circumstances.'The wellbeing, safety and security of all people in immigration detention is of paramount importance,' a spokesman for Mr Morrison said in a statement to AAP.
