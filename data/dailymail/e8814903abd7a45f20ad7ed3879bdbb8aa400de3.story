Cambridge United chairman Dave Doggett said it was a 'great honour' to be launching the FA Cup fourth round weekend on prime-time terrestrial TV after the BBC chose the tie at home to Manchester United for a Friday night live broadcast.

It will be viewed by millions at home in the UK and many more around the world, but the problem for League Two Cambridge is the unfamiliar logistical test of ticketing a high-demand game at the R Costings Abbey Stadium with its 8,000 capacity and out-dated facilities.

'We could sell the stadium out ten times over,' said Doggett.

'We have a few things to sort out quickly. We only have one room for hospitality, the toilet blocks are from the 1950s and the stadium is quite an odd shape.

'The biggest challenge is to make sure the people who come on a regular basis get tickets.

'To be deemed such an attractive fixture that it will be live on TV at eight o' clock on a Friday is an honour. 

'No doubt it will go around the world and hopefully it can be a good showcase for League Two football. 

'People might be surprised by the standard and it might even help us to increase our season ticket sales.'

Cambridge are desperate for a new ground and will hope the TV exposure chimes with local authorities which have complicated the club's attempts to revamp the Abbey Stadium or move to a new site.

The live BBC ties in the third round – Arsenal v Hull and AFC Wimbledon v Liverpool – both attracted peak television audiences of more than 6.5million. Manchester United's win at Yeovil on BT Sport attracted up to 1.2m viewers.

Teams will receive £144,000 from the FA in television money and £90,000 from the prize money fund if they get no further than the fourth round.

Cambridge will kick-off the fourth round on Friday, January 23 (7.55pm). The other live BBC game will be on the Sunday (2pm), featuring replay winners Doncaster or Bristol City v Everton v West Ham.

BT Sport will screen Liverpool v Bolton (Saturday, kick-off 5.30pm), Brighton v Arsenal (Sunday, kick-off 4pm) and Rochdale v Stoke (Monday 26th kick-off 8pm).

BBC Wales will show Blackburn v Swansea live on Saturday 24th kick-off 12.45pm. As this is on regional television, each club is paid £48,000 rather than the £144,000 for a national broadcast.

Third-round replays selected for live broadcast are West Ham v Everton on BT next Tuesday and Ipswich v Southampton on the BBC the following night.
