A Romanian builder who was left with half a head after a bad fall at work has had his skull rebuilt thanks to donations from well-wishers.

Disfigured and unable to work, Elvis Romeo Lingurar, from Livada, north-west Romania, could not afford the 1,000 euros he needed to pay for a prosthetic to replace the missing parts of his skull.

But after his story was reported in MailOnline and elsewhere earlier this year, generous readers who took pity on his plight sent him money to help pay for his surgery.

Now, with his head restored almost back to the way it was before his accident, the 24-year-old says he feels overwhelmed by the generosity of those who helped him.

'I feel much better now, I thank God for the second chance he has given to me. I also want to thank all the people for their help, and not to forget the doctors for their help for this surgery,' he said.

Mr Lingurar had been working on scaffolding around a demolition site last year when he lost his balance and fell six feet, smashing his head on the concrete below.

The hard landing shattered the left side of his skull and put him in a coma. He developed a blood clot on his brain and doctors were forced to remove the damaged parts of bone to save his life.

Although Romania, like Britain, has free universal healthcare, coverage did not extend to the surgery Mr Lingurar needed to repair his skull, and he was forced to live with his disfigurement.

With his brain protected only by skin stretched across the remaining portions of his skull, he was left unable to work since the slightest knock on his head could have proved fatal.

'I prayed to God all the time to help me, every Sunday I go to church and pray,' he said.

'When I was in the hospital [after the accident] I was scared that I would never get back to normal, especially when I saw myself in the mirror with half a head.

'After a week in hospital I went home, where I spent three months recovering. Altogether I was left with half a head for 13 months.

'I couldn't afford to have my head fixed so I decided to go on the street and beg people for money.'

'I thank God for the second chance': Mr Lingurar said that after a year out of work, he hopes to get back soon

Local journalist Alex Prunean discovered Mr Lingurar and filmed an interview with him in an effort to highlight his situation. After that, news outlets worldwide picked up the story.

Now, thanks to readers who took pity on Mr Lingura and reached out to help, he has had the life-changing surgery he needed to get him back to normal.

'I wasn't afraid for the second surgery to repair my head either because I told myself that if I got over the first one, I will get over this one too,' he said.

He added: 'The surgery took four or five hours. I didn't look in the mirror immediately after. Three days after a nurse came to change my bandages and I asked her to take a picture on me on a phone so I could send it to my family.

'When I saw myself I was very happy to finally be back to normal.

'My family were very happy for me too, I haven't been able to work for a year but I help my family with everything I can and I hope to get back to work very soon.'
