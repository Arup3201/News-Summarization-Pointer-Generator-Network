These images may look like photographs of some of the biggest names from stage and screen, but they have in fact been drawn completely by hand by an Italian artist.

The stunningly realistic pictures of the likes of Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron were created by Franco Clun using a simple lead pencil.

The steady handed artist has spent painstaking hours immortalising A-list names including British actors Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen.

Stunning: Talented Italian artist Franco Clun has produced 'hyper-real' images of A-list celebrities including Johnny Depp, left. But the artist is also fond of depicting animals and everyday people, including this realistic image of a cat and a fishbowl, right

Life-like: A portrait of the actor Viggo Mortensen playing the character Aragorn in the Lords of the Rings films

Contrast: Franco's animal drawings range from this cute picture of an adult dalmatian and one of her pups, left, to a more dramatic image of a roaring lion, right

Franco, 51, said: 'I started drawing famous people that somehow gave me something special back.

'I began to study the famous faces I thought I knew so well and I began to study new details.

'At the end of each drawing, I feel I know so much more about the person I have drawn.

'Only when you try to draw something you can say you have seen it for real.'

Each realistic drawing takes Franco an astonishing 50 hours to produce and he sells each A4 picture for 500 Euros (Â£440) each.

Pencil portraits: An Officer and a Gentleman actor Richard Gere is pictured left as is Franco's depiction of House star Hugh Laurie

He's a natural: Franco doesn't just draw people, he also creates hyper-realistic drawings of animals, such as this owl

Painstaking detail: As well as drawing famous people, the artist also draws everyday people from all across the globe

As well as drawing celebrities such as former Doctor Who actor David Tennant and House star Hugh Laurie, Franco has also produced drawings of animals and ordinary people from around the world.

Franco added: 'For each new drawing I dedicate more time and attention and I try to push forward my technical limitations.

'I learn something new every time I take a pencil in my hand.

'There are friends who encourage me. But the comment that made me most proud came from a friend who believes that my drawings tell a story.'

Franco will exhibit his drawings in Milan later this year.
