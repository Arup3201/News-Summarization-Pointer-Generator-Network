Tim Krul could be back in goal for Newcastle at Chelsea this weekend – and his return can’t come soon enough for the Magpies.

The Dutch keeper was expected to be sidelined until the end of January after injuring his ankle in training in November.

But Krul is now back in training and Sportsmail understands he could feature against the Premier League leaders on Saturday.

United have struggled in the absence of their No 1. They have conceded 21 times since his injury and rookie goalkeeper Jak Alnwick – who replaced Rob Elliot when he tore his thigh muscle – has been left brutally exposed in too many matches.

Meanwhile, caretaker boss John Carver will be told on Monday if he will be in charge for the trip to Stamford Bridge.

The club’s hierarchy – led by managing director Lee Charnley and chief scout Graham Carr – will press ahead with efforts to find a replacement for Alan Pardew after he left to take charge of Crystal Palace.

Steve McClaren remains favourite for the position despite denials from Derby County that he is interested in the vacancy at St James’ Park.
