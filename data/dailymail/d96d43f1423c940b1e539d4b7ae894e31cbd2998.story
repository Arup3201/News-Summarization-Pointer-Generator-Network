Alan Irvine had to endure a barrage of abuse from his own supporters as he headed down the tunnel at the end of what may prove to be his last game as head coach of West Bromwich Albion.

Irvine’s seventh defeat in nine Premier League games was inflicted by two second-half goals from Stoke striker Mame Diouf. Both were deflected, which perhaps sums up the Scot’s luck at present, and time will tell if chairman Jeremy Peace’s notoriously itchy trigger finger holds off long enough for him to stay in charge for the trip to West Ham on New Year’s Day.

Afterwards, Irvine insisted that he is still capable of turning the club’s fortunes around but admitted that the decision is out of his hands.

‘I believe that I am,’ he said. ‘I think the players believe we all are as well, but obviously other people will make decisions as far as that’s concerned. I’m not in control of that.

‘I want to carry on, I want to still do this job and see it turning around. That’s not going to change. We’re all in this together.

‘It’s not really about me, I’m more concerned about the players and the team. I’ ve got to get on with it, there’s no other choice is there? It’s one of those situations where I try to make changes to see if I can help things. You hope they work. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don’t.’

Nearly 3,000 Albion fans made the trip to the Britannia Stadium for this Midlands derby and stayed largely supportive of Irvine until the 63rd minute when he replaced Stephane Sessegnon and James Morrison with Saido Berahino and Silvestre Varela.

Irvine later defended the decision by pointing out that both Sessegnon and Morrison have been carrying injuries, but it was met with a chorus of ‘You don’ t know what you’re doing’. When Diouf claimed a fortuitous second goal for Stoke three minutes later, the travelling fans were in open revolt.

They hurled abuse at Irvine as he walked past them en route to the dressing-rooms at the end.

‘I don’t know if they would have wanted me to acknowledge them,’ added Irvine. ‘What do you do in those circumstances?

‘I can understand. People are frustrated, I’m frustrated, and so are the players. I can understand them expressing that, it’s the nature of the job.

‘If anyone is going to take it then I’m the person. I’m there to be shot at. I stand out there and take it. I’m prepared to take the criticism.’

West Brom had actually played the neater football for a much of a first half short on clear-cut chances.

But it was Stoke who made the breakthrough six minutes after the restart with a goal that must have felt like a dagger to the heart for Irvine.

Bojan Krkic had possession in midfield and sprayed the ball wide to Erik Pieters who had made an overlapping run on the left.

The Dutchman pulled it back to Diouf who took Chris Brunt and Gareth McAuley out of the game by switching the ball from his left foot to his right, and then beat Ben Foster with a low shot that took a slight deflection off Joleon Lescott.

West Brom nearly equalised when Asmir Begovic parried Craig Gardner’s close-range effort and McAuley scrambled the loose ball against the post.

Within seconds, the game – and possibly Irvine’s future – had been decided.

Again Bojan was involved, cutting inside from the left and laying a pass off for Marko Arnautovic. The Austrian tried his luck with a fierce effort from 25 yards and it took a bizarre double deflection off Diouf before rolling inside the post with Foster helpless to keep it out.

It secured Stoke’s first back-to-back wins in the league this season as Mark Hughes’s side moved up to 11th place.

Aside from a hamstring problem that forced Bojan off towards the end, the only blemish for Stoke was that Diouf will shortly be leaving on international duty with Senegal at the Africa Cup of Nations.

‘We’re going to miss him but hopefully they’ll get knocked out pretty quickly and he won’t miss too many games,’ joked Hughes.

Irvine, for one, will struggle to see the funny side.
