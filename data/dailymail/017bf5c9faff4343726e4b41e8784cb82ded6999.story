A recording of Shelly Sterling's frantic 911 call to report V. Stiviano breaking into her Beverly Hills mansion has been released, in which she reveals her husband Donald's ex-girlfriend entered the house through a side-door and was 'tormenting him'. 

Southern California real estate mogul Donald Sterling lost ownership of the L.A. Clippers basketball team in August when it was revealed that he made racist statements to Stiviano after she posted a picture with NBA legend Magic Johnson on Instagram.

When police arrived at his house following his wife's call, Sterling told them that Stiviano was an 'invited guest'.  

The 911 call started rumors that Sterling was back with Stiviano, despite the controversy surrounding the tapes and the fact that he and wife Shelly are actively engaged in a legal battle with his ex-mistress.

Help: Shelly Sterling called 911 earlier this month to report a break-in at her Beverly Hills mansion. She told police that V Stiviano sneaked in through a side-door and was 'tormenting' her husband.

No problem here: When police arrived at the home, Donald Sterling (pictured with glasses) told law enforcement that Stiviano (right) was his 'invited guest'. Stiviano was allegedly his mistress for a few years 

Mrs Sterling was out of town on October 1 when her gardener called to say that  Stiviano had 'broke into the house' using a side door. 

Fame seeker: In the midst of the scandal that cost Sterling his team, Stiviano was pictured out and about L.A. in a series of strange attention-grabbing costumes 

'She's in an upstairs bedroom. You gotta go there fast because she's dangerous,' Mrs Sterling says in the recording released by TMZ.

It appears Mrs Sterling didn't call her husband, before she dialed Beverly Hills police from France to report the'break in'. 

When asked to described the female intruder, Mrs Sterling called Stiviano an 'African black' and mentioned several times that she and her husband have an active lawsuit against her. 

The lawsuit, which predates the Clippers scandal, accuses Stiviano of taking gifts from the Sterling family including a Ferrari, $240,000 in cash and a $1.8million home in exchange for sexual favors. 

Stiviano has fought these charges, claiming that Sterling is actually a gay man who used her to hide his sexual orientation and that he paid for the lavish gifts with his own money. 

She said the female intruder was 'stressed about the suit' 

When the 911 operator asks for her husband's phone number, to check that he is alright, Mrs Sterling refuses. 

'Well don't call him because he'll say nothing is happening it's OK because he doesn't want to have the problem so please don't call,' she said. 

About six police officers were dispatched to the scene and when they arrived, they talked to Sterling and let Stiviano stay at the house as his guest.

Following the scandal in which the NBA forced him to sell his team, Mrs Sterling stepped in as a representative of the family and helped broker the record-breaking deal to sell the Clippers to ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer for $2billion.

Ballmer officially became the new owner of the clippers at the end of August. 

Separated: Shelly Sterling and husband Donald are still married, despite being estranged for some years. She represented the family when the NBA ordered Sterling to sell his team, and brokered the record-breaking deal to transfer ownership of the team to ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer for $2billion
