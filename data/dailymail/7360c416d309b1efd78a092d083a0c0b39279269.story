Scottish Premier League club Motherwell have launched the new initiative ‘Flexi-Ticket’, in an attempt to allow fans to get to more games, but for cheaper prices.

The revolutionary idea allows fans to buy either a five or 10 match ticket, appealing to fans who cannot commit to a full season ticket.

After receiving feedback, the club determined that fans were unable to attend games due to work commitments and various other issues.

Passionate: Motherwell are hoping to bring in more fans with the new Flexi-Ticker initiative

Affordable: Motherwell are making ticket prices very reasonable to their supporters

At £150 for 10 games, which works out to just £15 per game, the Flexi-Ticket ensures fans who can’t make every game get the same cost-per-game value as full-time season ticket holders.

Motherwell have launched initiatives like this before, such as ‘bring a friend along for free’ schemes to league games, boosting both attendances and relationships with fans.

Meanwhile, the Steelmen currently sit 10th in the Scottish Premiership after picking up three points from their opening five games.
