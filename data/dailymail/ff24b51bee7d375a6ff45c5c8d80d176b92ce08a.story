A father has accused police of using excessive force on his ten-year-old son when they handcuffed him and placed him face down on the trunk of their patrol car. 

Moses Maldonado of Kissimmee, Florida, posted a picture online of his son on the squad car after cops were called to his school. 

Staff say he was trying to hurt himself with a pair of scissors and making threats, according to Fox.

Accused of excessive force: A father is angry that police handcuffed his 10-year-old autistic son and put him the trunk of their squad car when he threatened to harm himself at his school in Florida 

But his father claims the police acted too aggressively when they carried the boy kicking and screaming from the classroom and detained him on top of the car.

He says his son is scared to go back to school and has heat rash and bruises from his treatment by the cops, according to WFTV.

He told Fox: 'Right now, my son is terrified of cops. What will happen in the future? Will my son be able to trust an officer? No, he's not. He's going to look at a cop and right away think he's going to get arrested.' 

The police department says officers acted appropriately and tried to talk Maldono's son down first - but when he would not cooperate and threatened to cut his own fingers off they intervened more forcefully.

A spokesman said the child was put on the trunk of the car because the asphalt was too hot and pointed out that the boy was not arrested, merely detained for his own safety. 

But Maldono claims they should have let him deal with the situation when he arrived at the school. 

'They didn't let me go to the classroom to help my son out. I'm his father. I can help him out. I can deal with the situation better than anybody else can,' he told Fox.  

'He's an autistic kid. They say things they don't mean, out of context, it's a touchy situation.'

A Kissimmee Police spokeswoman said: 'We train for this type of thing through crisis intervention training, it has a component with dealing with children with disabilities obviously we're going to train some more but the chief stands behind the officers decisions to go ahead and subdue the child,
