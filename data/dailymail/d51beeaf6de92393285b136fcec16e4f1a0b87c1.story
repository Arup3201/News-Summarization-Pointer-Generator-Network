They have been spoiled for goalscorers down the years at Anfield, but even those fortunate enough to have lived through the Ian Rush and Kenny Dalglish years will seldom have seen anything to match an attacking masterclass from Luis Suarez on Wednesday night.

There were supposed to be cracks appearing in the Liverpool push for a Champions League return after a recent dip in form, culminating in a widely and fiercely criticised defeat at Hull on Sunday.

Instead, the cracks were in Norwich's defence and how Suarez exploited them with a 19-minute hat-trick that earned him a standing ovation at half-time and another when he reappeared for the second half.

Still he wasn't finished, as he curled
 home an unstoppable 74th-minute free-kick to make it 11 goals in his 
last four appearances then revealed a less heralded string to his bow by
 laying on a fifth for Raheem Sterling.

They
 still chant Dalglish's name on the Kop and still serenade Rush for the 
four goals he put past Everton at Goodison Park back in November 1982. 
The way Suarez is going, his place in their affections will prove just 
as enduring.

An outrageous 
dipping volley rom 40 yards, razor-sharp close-range finish from a 
corner and unerring half-volley from the edge of the area combined to 
reignite Liverpool's supposedly faltering top-four challenge and leave 
Norwich nursing a persecution complex.

Brendan
 Rodgers describes his prolific frontrunner as a delight to work with 
but he's a statistician's dream as well, as Norwich will readily testify
 after being on the receiving end once more.

He
 left the field with the match ball after becoming the first player in 
Barclays Premier League history to score three hat-tricks against the 
same team, Norwich, while all six of his open-play goals from outside 
the box have also all come against the hapless Canaries.

It
 has taken him just 86 appearances to reach 50 Premier League goals, 
while his current 13-goal tally for this season is one more than the 
whole Norwich side have managed between them.

Little
 wonder Rodgers compared him to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, as 
he sent a chilling message to Premier League defences that he has yet to
 reach his peak.

The distance from which Luis Suarez scored his fantastic first goal is shown on the brilliant match zone

Luis Suarez is the first player in Premier League history to score three hat-tricks against the same team (Norwich).

All six of Luis Suarez's open play goals from outside the box in the Premier League have come against Norwich.

50 - Luis Suarez has reached 50 Premier League goals in just 86 appearances. Deadly.

Suarez now has more goals (13) than West Ham, Hull City and Stoke City (12), as well as Norwich and Spurs (11) this season.

AGAINST NORWICH:

22 October 2011 Liverpool 1 Norwich 1 (0 goals)

28 April 2012 Norwich 0 Liverpool 3 (3 goals)

29 September 2012 Norwich 2 Liverpool 5 (3 goals)

19 January 2013 Liverpool 5 Norwich 0 (1 goal)

4 December 2013 Liverpool 5 Norwich 1 (4 goals)

'The 
headlines are simple enough, eh boys?' smiled the Liverpool manager. 'I 
haven't seen many individual performances like that before. It was a joy
 to watch, sheer brilliance from one of the best strikers in the world. 
Among modern-day world-class operators like Messi and Ronaldo, it's all 
about numbers. They don't seem to deal in ones and twos any more. It's 
all fours and fives, and, of course, Luis has shown he can do that.

'He
 is the happiest he has been in all his time here, and that is adding a 
maturity to his play. This club suits him. It goes hand in glove with 
him, and I am convinced his best years are going to be spent here.

'The
 football we are playing is allowing him to exploit the spaces he likes 
playing in, and the way he is finishing things off deserves mention 
alongside Messi and Ronaldo. He is only 26 and is going to keep 
improving. The quality of his finishing was just incredible, and I 
actually felt sorry for Norwich's defenders, because there's not much 
you can do about it.

'You 
would have to toss a coin between the first and third for hew pick of 
the bunch, Initially, I thought the opener, but then I looked at the 
third again and just thought, "Goodness me, what a goal that was." It 
was a remarkable individual performance.'

World class: The forward converts in fine fashion yet again to seal his hat-trick... his third against Norwich

Not much he can do: Ruddy sits on the deck as Suarez is congratulated by his Liverpool team-mates

Suarez
 is in danger of monopolising goal of the season this year after the way
 he eased past Manchester City's Sergio Aguero at the top of the Premier
 League scoring charts.

His 
first entry came in the 16th minute when, after Leroy Fer missed an 
attempt to intercept a firm forward header from Steven Gerrard, he 
advanced a couple of paces before putting every last pounce of effort 
into a 40-yard volley that flew over a startled John Ruddy and into the 
net.

If his second, 13 
minutes later, was less eye-catching, it still said everything about his
 predatory instinct near goal, as he lashed a waist-high volley into the
 roof of the net, from a Philippe Coutinho corner, before anyone else 
could react.

Inevitable: He curls in a fantastic fourth

Records: Suarez is just the third man to score a first-half hat-trick in the Premier League

When the 
hat-trick goal arrived, there was almost an air of inevitability about 
it, exceptional though it was. Advancing towards the 18-yard line with 
the ball bouncing in front of him, he sensed the impending arrival of 
Fer on his right and responded by juggling it over him before hitting 
the crispest of half-volleys.

The
 vantage point from the press box is sideways on, rather than behind the
 line, yet there was a feeling of absolute certainty that the ball was 
bound for the corner of Ruddy's net, where it duly ended up, to jubilant
 roars from all corners of this famous old venue.

They've seen a few sights in their time, but nothing quite like this.
