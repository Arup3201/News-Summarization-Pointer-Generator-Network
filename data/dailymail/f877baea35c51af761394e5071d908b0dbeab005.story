Samir Nasri has warned table-topping Chelsea that his Manchester City team-mates possess the nerve and experience to chase down the league leaders and win the Premier League title.

City have secured the trophy in two of the last three seasons and on both occasions, they clawed back the pacesetters as the title race entered the final furlong.

In 2012, City were eight points behind Manchester United before reversing the deficit while Manuel Pellegrini’s side were nine behind Liverpool at one stage last season.

Heading into 2015, City have reduced the gap between themselves and Chelsea from eight to three points.

‘We know that we are good at being second and chasing someone,’ Nasri said. ‘We’ve done it before. We know how to deal with every situation and we are ready for it.’

The in-form Frenchman maintains that City have learned the lessons of their meek title defence during the 2012-13 campaign, when they surrendered their Premier League crown with barely a whimper to Manchester United.

City threw away a two-goal lead and missed the chance to close the gap on Chelsea to one point 

‘Yes, we all know what happened and it’s an example for us,’ Nasri added, ‘We learn from our mistakes. We finished 11 or 12 behind United. I know this will not happen. All we want is to win the league again - and we’ll do everything possible to do it again.’

‘Everyone is stronger. We get older, we get more mature and stronger mentally. You learn to deal with different situations. At this club we’ve been through all the different situations. We know how to deal with the pressure.’

It is a statement that may sound rather hollow after City relinquished a 2-0 lead to draw 2-2 against Burnley on Sunday afternoon. Manager Manuel Pellegrini put City’s struggles down to complacency and the tiring effects of a ‘heavy pitch’ at West Brom on Boxing Day. Nasri insists City can have no excuses.

‘Yes, but it’s not an excuse that we were tired. Look at their team [Burnley], they played exactly the same XI as played against Liverpool. Both teams didn’t have many changes. Sometimes it’s like this and you have to accept it. They played well - a draw was fair.’

City take on Sunderland on New Years Day at the Etihad Stadium and may have to do without Vincent Kompany and Yaya Toure, who continue to nurse calf and groin problems respectively. There is, however, some better news on the injury front, with Edin Dzeko hoping to return ahead of schedule.

It had initially been feared that the Bosnian frontman would be out until the second half of January after pulling a calf muscle in the warm-up at Leicester City earlier this month. He is now optimistic of returning in time for the trip to Everton on January 10 while Sergio Aguero could yet make the home match against Arsenal the following week.
