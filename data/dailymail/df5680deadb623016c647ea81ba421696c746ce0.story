A 90-year-old man who was arrested for feeding the homeless in his Florida city was back at it on Wednesday, despite being apprehended by police on Tuesday.

Arnold Abbott has helped to prepare hundreds of meals a week for countless hungry homeless persons in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, since 1990, but a new ordinance now makes this illegal in the city.

As a result, Abbott and and two ministers from the Sanctuary Church were arrested while dishing out hot food on Tuesday night.

Against the law: A new ordinance in the city now makes this illegal, and Abbot was arrested on Tuesday and Wednesday (above) by police

Great man: Abbott believes if he does not continue his work homeless people will be forced to steal or dumpster dive

That, however, is not stopping them, and they were back at it again on Wednesday night as if nothing had happened.

And after they finished serving food, police again arrested Abbott. 

It seems that despite Abbott's amazing charitable ways, the mayor of the city, Jack Seiler, has nothing but disgust for the selfless old man.

Seiler told Local 10, 'Mr. Abbott has decided that he doesn't think these individuals should have to have any interaction with government, that they should be fed in the parks. We disagree.'

Dishing it out: Abbott says he received calls from all over the world on Wednesday supporting him

Common criminal: Now, Abbott is facing two $500 fines and up to four months in prison

Abbott, however, has brought up the point that many of these people would be forced to dumpster dive, or just starve, without these meals.

'What the city is doing by cutting out feeding is very simple -- they are forcing homeless people to go dumpster-diving all over again,' Abbott said. 

'They will steal. That's what the mayor is forcing the homeless to do.'  

Classic villain: Mayor Jack Seiler even came out against Abbott's charity work, saying he 'disagrees' with what he is doing

And many seem to agree with him, with Abbott saying he received calls from around the world on Wednesday. 

'I love the city. I live here, it's a beautiful place and I'd like to keep it beautiful, but you cannot sweep the homeless under a rug,' explained Abbott. 

'There is no rug large enough for that.'

Abbott is likely to face a $500 fine for each arrest and could be sentenced to up to four months behind bars.
