Bad plan: Jamie O'Neill, 27, robbed a taxi driver who he had called to his own house

An incompetent thief who robbed a taxi driver at knifepoint was foiled because he had ordered the cab to his own house.

Jamie O'Neill, 27, stole a £240 phone from the driver - identified only as Mr Ahmed - before walking back into his home in Walsall, West Midlands, where he was quickly caught by police.

He had used his own phone to order the cab, and held Mr Ahmed at knifepoint, before making the 10-yard dash for his house.

O'Neill was sentenced to four years in prison today for his crime after being branded 'stupid' by his own defence lawyer.

Wolverhampton Crown Court heard that O'Neill ordered the cab with his own phone around 3am on 16 August this year.

He sat in the cab's passenger seat and pulled out a knife which he held under Mr Ahmed's chin. He told him to 'give me all your money'.

A scuffle broke out and Mr Ahmed was able to elbow O'Neill in the face and break the knife in two. He then ran away, allowing him to make off with the phone.

After O'Neill left, Mr Ahmed called the police with his taxi radio, who were quickly able to arrest the criminal.

Prosecutor Joanne Barker said: 'The defendant got in without saying anything and leant forward.

'In his left hand he had a knife - he placed the knife under the driver's chin and said "give me all your money".'

Sentencing, Judge Robin Onions said: 'Only you will know what was going through your mind.

'In some ways it's a bizarre robbery as you called the taxi to your own home.

'It was clearly a pre-planned offence and a terrifying incident for the taxi driver.

'The victim was vulnerable. Taxi drivers have to be protected, but every so often they have to put up with people like you.'

Nigel Ford, defending, admitted that O'Neill's actions 'defied all logic'.

He said: 'He's a very distinctive young man and on the level of stupidity it's right up there. He was always going to be immediately apprehended by police. The potential gains were limited.

'Mr O'Neill fully appreciates the position he's placed himself in.

'This must have been a very frightening incident for Mr Ahmed.'
