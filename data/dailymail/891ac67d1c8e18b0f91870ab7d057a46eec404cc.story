A man cut off his ex-girlfriend's nose with a steak knife leaving it hanging from her face by a thread after confronting her about a new boyfriend.

Dale Hathaway, 27, has been jailed for eight years today after launching a savage attack on Maria Vella, 33, in the lobby of a  Newport hotel as young children and families looked on in horror.

She was found lying in a pool of blood screaming with the 'most horrific injuries' police officers had ever seen and needed 200 stitches to re-attach her nose, Cardiff Crown Court heard.

The pair had spent the afternoon drinking together at the Newport Hilton hotel in April – but the conversation became heated when Hathaway confronted her about her new boyfriend.

He then grabbed the steak knife and used it to 'effectively sever her nose from her face' after she asked him not to drive because he'd had too much to drink.

Prosecutor Robert Buckland QC said: 'Dale Hathaway's ex-girlfriend was seriously injured and has been left with permanent scarring after this horrific steak knife attack.

'This injury had a major and lifelong impact on the victim.'

'Hathaway was drunk and used the steak knife deliberately with the intention of causing serious injury.

'This offence was committed in public and in the presence of a young child.'

Ms Vella's wounds were so deep that it caused part of her nose to hang forward on to her top lip.

She continues to suffer from psychological trauma following the attack in April and says she is reminded of it every time she looks in a mirror.

'I never want to talk about this again,' she said.

Hathaway from Cardiff was jailed for six years at the city's crown court in October after he admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

But his sentence has been increased to eight years by judges sitting at London's Criminal Appeal Court, who said the original term was 'unduly lenient'.

He initially told police Ms Vella had fallen and hurt herself and then claimed he had 'thrown' the knife behind him and it had cut her accidentally.

But when a surgeon analysed the weapon and said 'significant force' must have been used to inflict the injury with the knife, he admitted the offence.

Increasing his sentence to eight years, Lady Justice Macur said the term was too short and did not reflect the 'aggravating factors' in this case.

Sitting with Mr Justice Blake and Mr Justice Dove, she added: 'Bearing in mind the use of a weapon, and the manner in which it was used and the description of the injury, we consider that the correct sentence was one of eight years.'
