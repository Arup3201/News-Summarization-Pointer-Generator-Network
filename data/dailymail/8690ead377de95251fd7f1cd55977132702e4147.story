For a while, standing at the finish line of the Boston Marathon in 2013 was the worst thing that happened to survivor James Costello, but it quickly became the best.

Costello was blown up in the terrifying attack but the resulting agony saw him meet the love of his life, the nurse who cared for him in hospital, and the couple tied the knot this past weekend.

The 31-year-old wed Krista D'Agostino in a ceremony and reception donated by local business.

In front of some 150 family and friends at Boston's Hyatt Regency, the couple said 'I do.' 

Happy day: For a while, standing at the finish line of the Boston Marathon in 2013 was the worst thing that happened to survivor James Costello, pictured, but it quickly became the best

The location was donated, as were services including wedding planning, video and cocktails, according to the New York Daily News. The beautiful photography of the event was donated by Prudente Photography.

The couple became close as Costello struggled through months of surgery and painful rehabilitation following the April 2013 bombing.

Though he didn't lose a limb like many others, he was left with painful wounds throughout his body.

A now-iconic image shows Costello staggering down Boylston Street in the aftermath of the blast with his clothes in tatters. 

Vows: Costello was blown up in the terrifying attack but the resulting agony saw him meet the love of his life, the nurse who cared for him in hospital, and the couple tied the knot this past weekend

Joy: Costello previously said he was so happy he'd been blown up because he got to meet D'Agostino

Loving: D'Agostino, a nurse at the Spaulding Rehabilition Hospital, nursed Costello through his operations

The bombing left three dead and more than 260 injured.

D'Agostino, who worked at the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital, nursed him through grueling skin graft operations and exhaustive physical therapy. 

'She hates when I say this, but I'm actually glad I got blown up ...I got her,' the survivor said on the 'Today' show in December.

Hyatt's marketing director Emily Sharp described the ceremony as 'amazing,' to the Daily News.

'They're the nicest, most deserving people.'

The newlyweds are now heading to Hawaii for a relaxing honeymoon.

The nuptials come a few months after another Boston bombing survivor - Costello's friend Marc Fucarile who lost his right leg - wed his high school sweetheart, and achieved his goal of walking down the aisle. 

Aftermath: This now-iconic image shows Costello staggering down Boylston Street in the aftermath of the blast with his clothes in tatters. He was at the event with a group of school friends who were also injured

Fucarile and his fiancée Jen Regan tied the knot at Fenway Park in April, a year after the roofer lost his right leg, broke his left, suffered severe burns and was peppered with shrapnel. 

The 35-year-old, who was the last bombing victim to leave hospital after undergoing a staggering 49 surgical procedures, had wanted to reclaim the week and create happy memories.

He grinned as he left the stadium, using a cane to help him walk on his new prosthetic and the support of his new wife's hand.

The couple, who have a six-year-old son, enjoyed a day themed with the colors of 'Boston Strong' - blue and yellow - from bridesmaid dresses to the Duck Tour buses used to ferry guests.

Fucarile, who had been planning his wedding when the bombs exploded and put the plans on hold, added that he knew right away that Fenway was the perfect venue for the wedding.

Stunning: The couple were married in front of 150 friends and loved ones at Boston's Hyatt Regency

Celebration: The location of the wedding was donated, as well as the wedding planning and cocktails

Happy ending: The joyous day came after months of grueling physical therapy for Costello

'We were going to get married on an island, a beach or Fenway Park,' Fucarile told Boston.com. 'Once we found out [the reception] would be at the Hotel Commonwealth, I told Jen, "We're getting married at Fenway Park somehow".'

Fucarile was watching a friend take part in the marathon with four boyhood buddies from Stoneham, Massachusetts when the bombs went off.

After the first bomb detonated, brothers Paul and J.P. Norden huddled with Jarrod Clowery, James 'Bim' Costello and Fucarale, not realizing they were inches away from the second device.

When it exploded, both brothers and Fucarile lost a leg, while Clowery suffered burns and shrapnel wounds and Costello was hospitalized with serious injuries.
