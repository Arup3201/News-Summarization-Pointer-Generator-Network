A street sweeper casually rakes leaves from a path before ducking behind a bush.

Seconds later he emerges with a bazooka and gets a clear shot on a Syrian army tank. It is blasted into oblivion.

This is what is happening in the war-torn city of Homs, and it is mirrored across the country.

Street fighting has broken out as President Assad orders a crackdown on anti-government protesters

Today, activists said Syrian forces fired on a funeral and charged a U.S.-born blogger with trying to incite sectarian strife.

After a bloody day of attacks that left at least 28 people dead yesterday five passengers in a car were also killed before anti-government insurgents hit back attacking a army convoy and killing eight soldiers.

Razan Ghazzawi is the latest among dozens of activists, journalists and bloggers who have been detained since the revolt against President Bashar Assad began nine months ago.

The brutal crackdown that followed has now killed more than 5,000 people and put thousands into security lockups, the U.N. said.

Blogger Razan Ghazzawi was traveling to Jordan to attend a conference on freedom of the press in the region when she was arrested, her friends said

Ms Ghazzawi, 31, had been documenting human rights abuses in recent months, and was arrested on December 4 at the border while on her way to Jordan for a conference on press freedoms.

On Monday, she was charged by Syrian authorities with trying to incite sectarian strife, spreading false information and weakening national sentiment.

It is a charge often leveled against those who challenge the Syrian regime, according to rights activists, and could carry a prison sentence of up to 15 years.

The Syrian Center for Media and Freedom of Expression in the Arab World where Ghazzawi worked said today that Ms Ghazzawi denied all the charges.

'We demand the immediate and unconditional release of our colleague Razan Ghazzawi as well as an end to her trial and the annulment of the completely baseless charges against her,' the SCM said.

Despite growing international pressure on his regime, Assad has forged ahead with his crackdown, unleashing security forces and the army on cities in a bid to crush an uprising inspired by similar revolts across the Arab world.

On Tuesday, regime forces fired on thousands of people taking part in a funeral procession in the northern city of Idlib, killing two people and pushing the day's death toll to at least 28.

The flare-up of violence near the Turkish border is fresh evidence that the Syrian uprising is growing into a full fledged insurgency.

Military defectors known as the Free Syrian Army have recently been fighting back with increasingly sophisticated attacks.

It has given many protesters hope of a fighting chance against President Assad's fiercely loyal forces, but also complicating an uprising that was once largely peaceful.

Troops opened fired on a car traveling through central Syria today, killing all five passengers inside, activists said.

The Local Coordination Committees 
activist network and the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human 
Rights said five people were traveling near the village of Khattab in 
the countryside of the central Hama province at dawn, when their car 
came under a barrage of gunfire from Syrian soldiers.

The groups did not say why the car 
was targeted, but security forces frequently target suspected 
anti-government activists in the restive area.

The Observatory also reported heavy 
gunfire in Hirak village in the southern province of Daraa as troops 
backed by tanks and armored personnel carriers hunted for activists. 
Three anti-regime military defectors were wounded in clashes with Syrian
 security forces in the area, it said.

In retaliation, gunmen believed to be army defectors opened fire on a military convoy in
 central Syria, killing eight soldiers, an activist group said.

The vehicle 'exploded in a ball of fire,' said Rami Abdul-Rahman, 
director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which
 relies on a network of activists on the ground inside the country.

The defectors have found shelter in 
cities and villages among sympathetic Syrians, their presence giving the
 regime a pretext to crack down even more strongly than before.

Authorities
 have also used the attacks by defectors to support their official 
narrative that the unrest in Syria is the work of armed gangs and 
terrorists, not true reform seekers.

The U.S., EU and the Arab League have imposed economic sanctions on Syria, and Washington and its Western allies are pushing for U.N. sanctions as well on Assad's regime.

Russia and China - two veto-wielding countries on the U.N. Security Council - have resisted the idea, and on Tuesday Russia's foreign minister accused the West of taking an 'immoral' stance on Syria and ignoring violence by the Syrian opposition.

Sergey Lavrov added that armed groups attacking Syrian government forces are 'aiming to provoke a humanitarian catastrophe and get a pretext for demanding an outside interference into the conflict'.

Tuesday's violence began in two villages near the Turkish border, after security forces entered and shot dead two civilians, according to Rami Abdul-Rahman of the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Regime forces also swept through villages in the area and attacked infiltrators at the border.

Residents of the villages of Maaret Musreen and Kfar Bahmoul responded by closing a main road with rocks and burning tires to the Syrian troops, who then opened fire at random, Mr Abdul-Rahman said, killing 11 civilians and wounding 26.

'These are intentional killings by the terrorists gangs of the regime,' said Mr Abu Mohammed, a resident of the nearby town of Maaret al-Numan, said,

'We will not abandon our demands,' he said. 'We want the downfall of the regime and we want the president to be put on trial, because he is behind the killings that the Syrian people are being subjected to.'

Army defectors later retaliated by attacking a security convoy in the nearby town of Bab el-Hawa with AK-47s and rocket propelled grenades, killing seven troops, activists said.

Mr Abdul-Rahman said security forces also killed three other people in the provincial capital of Idlib and two in the central province of Homs. The Local Coordination Committees, another activist group, gave a similar death toll.

Syria's state media reported that border guards intercepted 15 gunmen trying to sneak into the country from Turkey on Monday night. It said two were killed in the ensuing firefight and others were wounded.

It was the second such infiltration attempt from Turkey in a week.

Members of the Free Syrian Army have found shelter alongside thousands of Syrian refugees on the Turkish side of the frontier, making use of mountainous terrain, local smuggling networks and support among villagers on the Syrian side to stage cross-border attacks.

SANA also reported that 'armed terrorists' - its usual term for regime opponents - shot and killed Brigadier General Ghanem Ibrahim al-Hassan, who teaches at the Assad Military Engineering Academy in the town of Saraqeb in Idlib.

Since the revolt began, the Assad regime has blamed the bloodshed on terrorists acting out a foreign conspiracy to divide and undermine Syria. Until recently, most deaths appeared to be caused by security forces firing on mainly peaceful protests.
