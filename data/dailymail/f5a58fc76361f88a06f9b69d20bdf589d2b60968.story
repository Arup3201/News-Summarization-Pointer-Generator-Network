Feared murdered: Heiress Janet Brown vanished in 2005, police say her inheritance has been left untouched

Detectives fear an heiress who inherited £1million but never touched it may have been murdered.

Police have been seen digging up land behind the rural family home of Janet Brown, 51, who vanished in 2005.

When she went missing friends of the TV extra and property developer from Lowgate, Northumberland, were not immediately worried as she was known to travel abroad often.

But when Miss Brown didn't show up to either of her parent's funerals her friends told police they feared the worst, The Sun reported.

Detectives discovered budding actress Miss Brown hadn't touched her inheritance and there had been mysterious activity in her dead parents' bank accounts.

A man, 57, and a 63-year-old woman have been arrested on suspicion of fraud by false representation and were released on police bail.

Last night a source told The Sun: 'It doesn't take a genius to work out they're looking for a body.'

Friend Sheila Watchorn, 66, told the paper: 'We're convinced she's been murdered.'

Police spent much of last Wednesday searching and digging on land at Plane Trees Farm, in Lowgate.

Current tenant John Cairns told local paper, The Hexham Courant, police had been digging up the field periodically for the last 18 months.

He added detectives told him their investigation into what happened to Miss Brown had taken them to Spain, Italy and Thailand.

'They can’t tell me much,' he said. 'But they say her bank account and passports haven’t been used.'

Last
 year, when Northumbria Police first appealed for help from the public 
to trace Janet, a statement released by the force read: 'She hasn’t been
 seen since 2006 and although police have no immediate concerns for 
Janet’s well-being they want to trace and speak to her.'
