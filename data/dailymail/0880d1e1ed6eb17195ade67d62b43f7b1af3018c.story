The fugitive 'White Widow' of a 7/7 London bomber is wanted in connection with seven murders in Kenya, police have revealed.

British-born Samantha Lewthwaite is alleged to have ordered the killings of two radical Muslim clerics, two Protestant preachers, and three others with links to terror-group al-Shabaab.

Kenyan security officials have described her as an 'incredible threat' and said they are working 'around the clock' to bring her in.

Samantha Lewthwaite, 29, otherwise known as the White Widow, is wanted for ordering the murders of seven people in Kenya including two radical Muslim clerics and two Protestant preachers

Hate preacher Aboud Rogo Mohammed was gunned down in a drive-by shooting while taking his wife to hospital on August 27 last year.

Mohammed was shot 17 times as he drove along, while his wife Khania Said was shot once in the thigh. His father and five-year-old daughter, who were also in the car, were not hit.

Lewthwaite was a disciple of Mohammed's and preached with him at the Masjid Musa mosque in the port-city of Mombasa, converting thousands of Somalis to fight for al-Shabaab.

However, the pair fell out and a war of words began, during which Mohammed vowed to 'get rid' of Lewthwaite, who had become too demanding. He was killed nine months after she was last seen.

His successor, Sheik Ibrahim Rogo, suffered the same fate last month when he was also killed in a drive-by along with associates Omar Abu Rumeisa, Salim Aboud and Gadafi Mohammed.

The killings mark a rift between al-Shabaab and Lewthwaite, with security sources saying there is a power struggle between tribal elders and the White Widow.

Speaking to the Mirror, an intelligence source said: 'Samantha Lewthwaite is fighting for greater control of al-Shabaab which is angering the ­organisation’s hierarchy.

'She has become paranoid and ­unreliable to the group after being on the run for so long. They believe her judgement is clouded and she could find herself out on her own very soon.'

Two Protestant pastors, Charles Matole and Ebrahim Kidata, are also believed to have been killed at the request of Lewthwaite.

The body of Matole, 41, was found in the Redeemed Gospel Church in Mombasa  on October 19 sitting in a chair and clutching a bible.

He was executed with a single bullet to the head after police questioned him over whether any young men had come to him seeking help after being asked to join al-Shabaab.

Kidata's body was found dumped in bushes in the town of Kilifi, 40 miles from Mombasa, the day before Matole was killed.

Gunmen attacked the Westgate Mall in Nairobi in September, killing 67 people including children as young as five. The siege, which lasted several days, ended after soldiers stormed the building and the roof collapsed

The newly-ordained preacher, of the East African Pentecostal Churches, was believed to have been strangled.

East Kenya police commander Aggrey Adoli said: 'We believe Samantha Lewthwaite is behind these killings as well as a gang of others.

'We believe she is involved in ­recruitment of jihadists and propagation of al-Shabaab and Al Qaeda activities in the country with other like minded individuals. Once we apprehend Samantha Lewthwaite she'll have a lot of questions to answer.

'She is without a doubt an incredible threat to national and ­international security. We are working round the clock to bring her in to stop her causing more carnage.'

The officer said she is wanted on charges of 'murder and inciting Muslim youths to violence'.

Interpol issued this international arrest warrant for Lewthwaite after she was named as one of the prime suspects behind the Westgate Mall massacre in Nairobi in September

Seven of Lewthwaite's ­disciples, including a Tanzanian preacher, a Somali national, a Ugandan and three Kenyans, are also being hunted.

Lewthwaite is the widow of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay, who blew himself up on a Piccadilly Line train between King's Cross St Pancras and Russell Square stations.

The mother-of-four was born in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, and was the son of a former soldier before converting to Islam.

The convert is linked to the Westgate Mall massacre in Nairobi in which 67 people were killed, and is thought to be hiding in Somalia.

Interpol issued a 'Red Notice' warrant for her arrest shortly after the attacks for terrorist offences in Mombasa dating back to 2011.
