Like fellow designer-turned-activist Katharine Hamnett, Vivienne Westwood has never been afraid to reveal her political views in public.

And so it was with her latest catwalk show which ultimately said more about her views on climate change (bad!) than it did about what we'll be wearing come next summer.

Of course, there was an element of that - how could there not be - and what appeared turned out to be vintage Vivienne.

Eco-friendly: Vivienne Westwood often uses clothes to make political statements, as in this instance

Modern classics: Underneath the hair and make-up was well-executed tailoring and pretty garden florals

The well-executed tailoring was present and correct, with a beautifully structured black pea coat revealing that Dame Vivienne's dab hand with the scissors has in no way diminished with age.

Then there were shorts, in bright pumpkin orange and cool camel, that could easily be imagined into a holiday suitcase to be thrown on with a t-shirt or cosy knit.

Dresses too boasted Westwood's trademark tailoring and came in the shape of office-friendly shifts and red carpet ready floral gowns.

Another, a delicate baroque bandeau, was worn over a t-shirt loudly proclaiming the words 'Climate Change'.

This is where Westwood began to come unstuck. Rather than drawing attention to her message - and it is a good one - it jarred with the delicate dress.

Wearable: Despite the climate change message, Westwood offered up a positive vision for S/S14

Starring role: Flame haired model Lily Cole was handed a central role in proceedings, which included a dance

Ethereal: Lily Cole's floating dance moves formed a central part of the show at London's German Gymnasium

Daywear: A neatly tailored navy shift dress

Accessories: Westwood's bags and boots were a highlight

Tailoring: A structured coat showed Westwood's talent

Then came Lily Cole. Cole, now a rare sight on the catwalk, returned to perform a bizarre dance at the behest of the designer.

Twirling
and swooping in a flowing goddess gown, she looked like nothing so much
as a young Vivienne Westwood - made all the more plain when she 
returned for an encore, bearing a bunch of blood red blooms for the 
designer.

But while the 
designer's excellent tailoring and sympathetic message were enough to 
earn her a bouquet, they didn't entirely work in sync.

As
much political meeting as fashion show, Westwood brought two very 
disparate worlds together. The result? At times, more theatrical than 
stylish.

Carmen Borgonovo of my-wardrobe.com added: 'Dame Vivienne conjured her mystical magic again with a collection full of off-kilter tailoring and curve enhancing dresses.'
