In this age of computers and smartphones, some of us are finding it harder and harder to write properly with one hand, let alone two.

But that is no such problem for Chinese translator Chen Siyuan.

She has been amazing onlookers with her ability not only to write with both hands at the same time, but do it in different languages - Chinese with one and English with the other.

And for good measure the 24-year-old can also perform the trick with each hand writing in different directions.

Chen, whose name means 'think further', didn't develop her skill through hours of practise.

Instead she discovered it by chance while trying to save time on large amounts of English homework at her high school in northern China.

Talented: Chen now uses her skill to write poetry, two sentences at a time of course

She told People's Daily Online: 'When I was in high school, I unconsciously wrote with both hands while trying to finish my homework in a hurry.

'My classmates were curious and tried to imitate me, but none of them succeeded.'

Chen, who later obtained a college degree in English, now uses her talent to write poetry, two sentences at a time, of course.
