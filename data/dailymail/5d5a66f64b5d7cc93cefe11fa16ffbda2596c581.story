The photographer behind Beyonce's approved tour pictures has opened up about being 'more grateful' than ever, despite being diagnosed with stage four oesophageal cancer earlier this year.

In a YouTube video posted by the singer's team, 32-year-old Yosra El-Essawy, a London native born to Egyptian parents, talks about the life-changing experience of travelling with Beyonce and the rest of her crew for her Mrs Carter tour.

'I have never felt more grateful in my life,' she says. 'This is a gift to me. This period is happening for me, not to me, to the point [where] I don't even feel sick. I feel incredibly, incredibly blessed.'

Ms El-Essawy, originally a wedding photographer, is the woman responsible for taking 'Beyonce-approved' tour pictures following the singer's ban on all other photographers at her performances.

While Beyonce apparently trusts her with this enormous responsibility, Ms El-Essawy says she wouldn't have it any other way.

'Beyonce specifically is the only 
celebrity that I've ever vocalized wanting to photograph, ever,' she says in the clip. 'There's 
just such a humanity and beauty about her that I've always seen.

'It was 
never because of her outward beauty,' she says. 'I mean, that's obvious to any 
person who has eyes. It's her inner beauty - there's just something she 
emanates.'

On June 19, six weeks into the Mrs Carter tour, Ms El-Essawy was diagnosed
with stage four oeseophageal cancer, a disease which she 
says on her Facebook affects 'one in a million' people her age.

'Beyonce is the only 
celebrity I've ever wanted to photograph. There's such a humanity and beauty about her'

After being told she needed to take a break from touring to undergo chemotherapy and focus on her health, 'just hearing that, it crushed my more than being told I had cancer,' she explains.

But despite being sick, Ms El-Essawy has made it her mission to see the positive in the situation.

Indeed, she says in the video: 'The fact the tour happened when it did 
was just so divinely timed. God has the ability to make amazing from 
terrible.'

According to her Facebook page, which 
she uses to update friends and fans on her progress, the photographer 
received good news about her health last month.
