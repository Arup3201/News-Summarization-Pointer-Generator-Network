This is the moment a blundering sneak thief ripped off a souped-up campervan's bodywork - but was caught red-handed by a secret dashboard camera staring straight at him.

Daylight robber Daniel Gordon, 25, plundered the front bumper off the sporty VW Transporter in broad daylight.

But he didn't realise he was being filmed - and was found when the owner put his DIY mugshot on Facebook.

Duck down: Car park thief Daniel Gordon can be seen ducking down near the VW campervan in Swansea

A court heard the dashboard camera caught the car park thief cannibalising the expensive van.

Owner Michael Thomas had spent £2,000 on a sports kit for his beloved VW campervan - and was devastated when he discovered it had been ripped off.

But when he played back the footage on his dashboard camera he saw the thief staring straight back at him.

Mr Thomas handed the footage to police and put it up on Facebook asking for help in identifying him. Gordon was quickly identified from the film footage and arrested.

In a police interview Mr Gordon said he stole the body parts because his friend needed them for his own van.

A court heard Mr Gordon told officers he sold them on for just £100.

In a victim impact statement, van owner Mr Thomas said: 'I've been left £830 out of pocket by the theft and had to take time off work to sort insurance and repairs to the van. 

'My wife was concerned the thief may come back and target us again.'

Mr Thomas has now changed the number plate of the van to avoid the thief being able to find them.

Swansea magistrates court was told Mr Gordon had 12 previous convictions for dishonesty offences.

His latest offence was committed while subject to a community order - imposed after being caught stealing from a car.

Louise Clissord, defending, said Mr Gordon had a £100-a-day cocaine addiction after diagnosing himself with depression.

Magistrates sentenced him to a 12 months community order supervision and a drugs rehabilitation order. He was also made subject to a curfew.

I'm off: He is clearly ready to leave the scene but looks directly into the dashboard camera as he goes
