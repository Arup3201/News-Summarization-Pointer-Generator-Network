Police are searching for two newlyweds after finding their wedding day pictures on a stolen iPod.

The white iPod nano was recovered by police after it was stolen from a house in Hillingdon, London, by burglars earlier this year.

But police have no idea who the couple are and are seeking to reunite them with the missing portraits.

Found: An iPod nano in white was found to contain a set of wedding photos including this one of the couple saying their vows

Detective Sergeant Charlie Cairns of the Metropolitan Police, said: 'We’d really like to give back the pictures to the people they belong to.

'Somewhere there’s somebody who’s missing a set of wedding pictures, which no doubt they’re upset about.

'We’ve tried tracing the back the item to the property it may have come from but we just can’t find it.'

The iPod was recovered from a haul of stolen goods and police sifted through the images to try and return the item.

The happy day: The bride is pictured surrounded by friends on her wedding day

It includes a black and white picture of the newlyweds exchanging vows moments before they kiss.

There is also a shot of the bride alongside nine women, believed to be her bridesmaids and maids of honour.

Another image shows the entire party gathering on the lawn outside a country home in the sunshine.

The theft could have taken place in Hillingdon or bordering areas of Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire or Thames Valley area.

Further property including expensive jewellery was also recovered, which may belong to the same victim.
