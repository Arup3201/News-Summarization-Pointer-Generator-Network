It's called Britain’s Got Talent. So the show’s fans were a little miffed when the best this country had to offer turned out to be, well … the best another country had to offer.

Some viewers complained that the ITV programme was not living up to its name after its latest stand-out act turned out to be a professional dance duo from Holland.

Dutch pair Martin van Bentem, 32, and Marielle Constancia, 36, impressed judges with a gravity-defying acrobatic routine on Saturday night.

Mr van Bentem, who regularly appears in musicals, spun his partner around  effortlessly and at the end they received a standing ovation.  All four judges voted them through to the next round. Amanda Holden described the pair as ‘sexy and exciting’, adding: ‘You threw her around like my daughter throws her Barbies around the bedroom.’ 

Fellow judge Alesha Dixon added: ‘It was dangerous, it was thrilling, it was exciting, and from beginning to end it was so entertaining and you are just mesmerising to watch. I’m so glad you entered the competition.’

But many viewers complained that allowing foreign acts to compete with home-grown talent defeated the object of the show. Jordan Garraway tweeted: ‘I’m sorry, they’re good acts and that, but why do they let foreign acts on Britain’s Got Talent?’ Sophie added: ‘Quite often it’s the foreign acts that are the best but it is BRITAIN’S Got Talent! 

Polly Freestone said: ‘All of the best acts on Britain’s got talent are foreign, so basically Britain doesn’t  have talent.’ 

After their performance, Simon Cowell asked the pair why they had decided to enter the British show. Holland has its own version of the successful global franchise.

Mr van Bentem replied: ‘Britain’s Got Talent is the biggest talent show in the world.

‘We did some things in Holland and now we want to explore and show the world what we can do.’ Cowell said: ‘I’ve always said we always welcome everyone from around the world on this competition and I think we’re very lucky to have you audition on this show. 

‘In fact it’s honestly one of the best things I’ve seen on this show.’ 

The Dutch pair aren’t the first competitors from overseas to find success on the programme. Last year German Dennis Egel reached the semi-finals with a routine that involved singing Nessun Dorma in giant gold wings.

A Britain’s Got Talent spokesman said: ‘We want to showcase the best variety talent that will entertain our audiences and it’s a testament to the success of the series that, following the global success of the likes of Susan Boyle, people from all over Europe want to appear on our show.’

Anyone with the right to live and work in the UK is allowed to enter the contest, meaning it is open to all EU citizens.

And Cowell has previously said he hopes foreign talent will help spur on British competitors. 

He added: ‘I think it’s quite flattering that they fly all that way to enter this show because they see it as the flagship show, but it means our Brits have got to step it up now.’
