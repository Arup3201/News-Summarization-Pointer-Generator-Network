Actor James Franco has sparked a sexism controversy today after he tweaked the iconic command to signal the start of Daytona 500 in his role as Grand Marshall.

Instead of 'Gentlemen, start your engines,' often described as the most famous words in sport, the 34-year-old Hollywood star said 'Drivers...and Danica...start your engines!'

Changing his command to accommodate Danica Patrick, the first woman to start from the pole in a Cup race, Franco nevertheless caused Twitter to light up in indignation over his perceived insensitivity.

James Franco used an unfortunate choice of words to signal the start of the Daytona 500 today in Florida in his role as Grand Marshall

As unpredictable as ever, he passed on a chance to copy the instruction that was used when Patrick raced in the Indianapolis 500, 'Lady and gentlemen, start your engines.'

His critics pointed out that the published author and poet should have seen the distinction he was creating by making an exception of Danica.

His command as Grand Marshall can easily be interpreted as implying that Danica was not a 'driver' like the men who made up the rest of the field.

USA Today's motor racing reporter Nate Ryan was especially critical of Franco's perceived mistake, tweeting, 'That command didn't exactly dovetail with Danica Patrick's long-stated worldview of being a driver/racer first and a woman second.'

And photographer Zeb Palmer simply stated on the social networking website, 'OK, the grand marshal is dumb. This is first race?'

Blogger Chris Credendine remakred that, 'I know James Franco didn't mean it, but he definitely butchered the most famous words in #NASCAR with that Danica Patrick comment.'

And viewer Jeanne Rice was the most cutting, tweeting to her followers, 'Wow James. How's that foot taste in your mouth?'

The Oscar-nominated actor was in town to promote his new film, 'Oz, the Great and Powerful' and noted in his pre-race press conference that 'Danica had done something special here, so I might have to switch it up.'

Prompting unfortunate memories of his awkward co-hosting of the 2011 Oscars alongside Anne Hathaway, Franco's gaffe at the race start indicated that perhaps the actor needed a few more rehearsals.

And following a thrilling race, Jimmie Johnson won his second Daytona 500, racing past defending NASCAR champion Brad Keselowski on the final restart, while Danica Patrick finished eighth.

Johnson wasn't challenged over the final six laps Sunday, adding another 500 title to go with his 2006 victory.

This time crew chief Chad Knaus can enjoy it â€“ he was suspended by NASCAR for the first victory.

Dale Earnhardt Jr. made a late move to finish second, but didn't challenge his Hendrick Motorsports teammate for the victory. Mark Martin was third.

Patrick was third on the final lap, but faded in the flurry of late action. She became the first woman in history to lead laps in the Daytona 500, though, with her three laps out front.

Before the race all eyes were on Patrick - only the third woman to compete in what is known as 'The Great American Race.

Patrick started the Daytona 500 from pole position and no one doubts she deserves all the attention she is receiving or her credentials to compete with the very best.

Patrick, who ran a partial Sprint Cup program last year, showed she was ready to race full-time in American stock car racing by qualifying with a top speed of 196.434 mph around Daytona International Speedway last Sunday.

Her top speed was the fastest qualifying effort at Daytona since 1990 and inevitably raised talk about her becoming the first woman to win the coveted prize.

Chris Credendino a New York City based blogger made allowances for Franco but still took him to task

Jeff Gordon, who will start alongside Patrick on the pole, summed up the feeling after qualifying: "It's great to be a part of history with Danica being on the pole. I think we all know how popular she is, what this will do for our sport."

Patrick, who has astutely marketed herself throughout her career in IndyCar racing and then NASCAR with some lucrative and high-profile endorsement deals, including regular appearances in Super Bowl commercials, is not talking down her chances.

'When pressure's on, when the spotlight is on, I do feel like it ultimately ends up becoming some of my better moments, better races, better results,' she said earlier this week.

'I'm grateful for it because the opposite of that would be I'm guessing I probably wouldn't be here today, and I wouldn't be in the position I'm in.

'I've been lucky enough to make history, be the first woman to do many things. I really just hope that I don't stop doing that. We have a lot more history to make.'

Also causing controversy and getting himself into awkward situations at the race track today was rapper 50 Cent.

50 tried to accompany Andrews as she walked pit road, but she was having none of it and turned her cheek when he leaned in for a kiss.

Earlier, 50 had surely raised the blood pressure of NASCAR officials when he arrived at Daytona and tweeted, 'Damn I don't see no black people lol.'
