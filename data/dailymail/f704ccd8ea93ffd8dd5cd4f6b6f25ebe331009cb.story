Liverpool winger Oussama Assaidi is poised to cut short a season-long loan to Stoke City and join a club in the Middle East - paving the way for Tottenham's Aaron Lennon to move to The Britannia Stadium and for Liverpool to reignite interest in England under-21 international Nathan Redmond of Norwich City.

Assaidi's £2million departure from the Premier League looks imminent with the 26-year-old Moroccan holding talks with Al-Ahli of Dubai with the blessing of both Liverpool and Stoke and is ready to undertake a medical.

The forward has failed to make an impact in England after a £2.4million move from Dutch club Heerenveen to Liverpool in 2012.

Assaidi's imminent departure paves the way for Tottenham winger Aaron Lennon to link up with the Potters

He made just four Premier League appearances, all as substitute, under Brendan Rodgers before initially joining Stoke on loan last season, and scoring a memorable winning goal against Chelsea.

But a second loan spell at The Britannia has not been as successful with Assaidi playing just 11 times for Mark Hughes and making it clear he would fancy a new challenge elsewhere.

Once a deal is confirmed, and it would give Liverpool a transfer fee, it frees up squad places both at Anfield and for Stoke.Stoke boss Hughes is interested in £6million Lennon with the 27-year-old winger told that he is not part of Mauricio Pochettino's first-team plans at White Hart Lane.

The Potters have also enquired about Redmond in the past but the Norwich City player is also the subject of interest from Liverpool and Southampton.

Liverpool are set to reignite their interest in Norwich's £10million-rated winger Nathan Redmond

He stayed loyal to Norwich at the end of last season after relegation but The Canaries are outside the promotion places and changed managers last week with Hamilton Academicals boss Alex Neil replacing Neil Adams.

Redmond, 20, is valued at £10million and is starting to consider a move to the top flight sooner rather than later so he is ready for the European under-21 championships this summer.

His international team-mate Nathaniel Chalobah is poised for a loan move from Chelsea to French club Bordeaux to also gain regular top-flight experience before the finals. He returned to Stamford Bridge last week after a loan move to Burnley failed to work out.Stoke face Arsenal on Sunday without Bojan and Biram Mame Diouf, who is away on African Cup of Nations duty.
