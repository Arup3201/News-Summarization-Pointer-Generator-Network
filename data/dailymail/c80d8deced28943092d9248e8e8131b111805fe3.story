A nine-year-old girl was diagnosed with a brain tumour after her family noticed she had started singing out of tune.

Eloise Mills was saved by her own voice after her grandparents took her to the doctor to find out why she could no longer sing, walk in a straight line or ride her bike.

A brain scan revealed a tumour the size of a walnut, surrounded by a cyst the size of an orange.

The Nottingham schoolgirl had been suffering from constant headaches for years but it was not until she became tone deaf and lost her balance that her family became convinced something was seriously wrong.

‘You could say her bad singing saved her life,’ her grandmother Cheryl Mills, 57, said today.

Eloise was diagnosed with pilocytic astrocytoma - a type of brain tumour which releases fluids, creating a cyst around it.

She underwent a three-hour operation to remove the benign tumour at Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham in August last year.

Now, after making a remarkably speedy recovery, Eloise is back behind the piano at her grandparents’ home in Ruddington, Nottingham.

The schoolgirl now belts out her favourite Adele songs, hitting every note, and even performs in her school assemblies.

Grandmother Cheryl, who is the nine-year-old’s guardian, said: ‘Eloise used to have a beautiful voice when she was little but gradually it got worse and worse.

‘We just thought she was tone deaf but when she started walking in wobbly lines we knew something must be wrong.

‘We're actually very thankful she did sing so much because it was the dramatic change in her singing which got us thinking something was wrong with her.’

Specialist Donald Macarthur, who performed the surgery, said although it was risky surgery which could have been fatal or left Eloise in a coma, it was deemed a risk worth taking as she was struggling to walk.

Mr Macarthur said: ‘Often, patients 
with conditions like this have headaches, which can have them feeling 
sick. We did the scan and decided we needed to do the operation.

‘We told the family there were risks, as there are with most operations.'

Mrs Mils added: ‘It was terrifying, although I think in my heart I had already guessed.

‘It had been going on for such a long time - we kept thinking it was bad. She couldn't even ride her bike.'

Eloise, an only child, suffered from headaches for four years, before she was finally diagnosed last year. The tumour was located at the base of her skull - making it difficult to detect.

Remarkably, Eloise only spent a few weeks in hospital after the operation and has been back in school since October.

She said: ‘I'm glad it's all over and really pleased.

‘The nurses at the hospital were so kind. I am just glad I can do my favourite things again like singing.’
