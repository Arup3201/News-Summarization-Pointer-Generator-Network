Marine biologist: Diane Cowan has worked with lobster breeding since 1996 off the coast of New England

Sick of the snow, the ice and the brutal cold weather? Then spare a thought for Diane Cowan who has been stranded on a island off Maine for more than a month thanks to heavy ice.

With no helicopter available to pull her out and crossing the mile stretch to the mainland on foot or in a vehicle too dangerous, marine biologist Cowan has been running low on supplies.

Iced-in on Friendship Long Island for the past 32 days, Cowan was delivered from hunger pangs by friends who chartered a plane to drop food and supplies for her and her dog, as the winter shows no signs of ending anytime soon.

Having spent the past 15-years on the island where her nonprofit Lobster Conservancy has a six-acre lobster pond, Cowan, 54, has said this winter is by far the worst she has known.

'I've been iced in for 32 days,' said Cowan to USA Today. 'The longest I've been trapped on the island before was two weeks.'

'I still don't know how much longer I'll be stuck here,' she said.

Boats have been unable to leave Friendship Harbor for three weeks after this years painful winter that has seen temperatures rarely rise above freezing.

While Cowan doesn't have running water she does have her dog, phone, a stove, electricity and the Internet.

However, her friends began to worry about her and organized a care package which they dropped in by plane.

They loaded three boxes with food and hired a pilot to fly over the two mile long and half-mile wide island so they could get low enough to drop the boxes safely.

The temperature was a chilly minus 12 degrees when they made the drop.

'The pilot was awesome,' said Bob Lary to USA Today. 'He did a couple of flyovers and got his bearings, (then) opened the window and said, 'Chuck it.' And I did, twice.'

While the first box hit the roof of one of the buildings on the island, the second one made a perfect landing.

'I was thrilled, absolutely thrilled,' said Cowan to the Bangor Daily News. 'And I also like the idea this could be done because it gives a whole new dimension to getting stuff out here longer term.'

Diane usually stocks up with two months of food to be on the safe side when she departs for the winter and keeps herself warm with a wood fire and solar panels for electricity.

But next year she says she is going to bring along a small box of treats which she will label, 'Don't open until February', just to be on the safe side.
