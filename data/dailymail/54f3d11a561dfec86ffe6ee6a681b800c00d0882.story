There was shock and disappointment in the west of Scotland this week when an absentee landlord told two employees that, after decades of service, they won’t be needed on his farm after Christmas.

From the employees’ point of view this is obviously upsetting.

But when the landlord is Paul McCartney and the farm is on the Mull of Kintyre, a remote part of Britain he once loved as a family hideaway and then made famous musically in one of his biggest hits, people around the world take notice — and wonder why this might be happening.

It’s believed the former Beatle has rarely spent much time on his vast 600-acre farm since his first wife Linda died in 1998, and that the house has fallen into a state of some disrepair.

That’s sad for a once much-loved home, but it also reveals a touching trait of human nature that we all share.

High Park Farm was the first home Paul and Linda created together. He’d bought it in 1966 when living with actress Jane Asher, but it was only after he married country-loving Linda in 1969 that he began to spend much time there.

I’d known Paul since 1967 when we met on the filming of the Magical Mystery Tour. But the first I ever heard about High Park Farm was early in 1970.

We were sitting in a fish restaurant in London and Paul, with Linda at his side, was rhapsodising about the mud and the simplicity of the place, about not having a bathroom and how he’d made the furniture, fixed leaks in the roof and sheared a sheep.

It sounded to me like some kind of hippy purgatory in endless, lashing rain, but he insisted he loved it. The Beatles had secretly broken up the previous autumn, and he’d been devastated.

Playing with the band had been the only job he’d ever had, and, unemployed though rich, he’d gone to Scotland to grieve.

After seven years during which he’d never been out of the world’s microscopic gaze, his only need was the comfort of his wife, and daughters Heather and Mary.

He would say later that, in his despair, he flirted with hard drugs while there, but that would have been only a momentary aberration as Linda, Mull and Mother Nature, in all the kindness of her sometimes inclement weather on the Mull, set about healing him.

‘I’m not some kind of hermit or recluse with a long beard having an awful time,’ he told me that day. ‘It’s a tramp’s life and I can wear the same shirt for ages up there. I need to get with the earth a bit. I love nature.’

Indeed, as he sang in Mother Nature’s Son on the Beatles’ White Album, love it he did. And as the McCartney family added Stella and James, and the house near Campbeltown took shape around them, Linda coaxed Paul’s confidence back.

Sitting with his acoustic guitar, some of his best post-Beatle songs were written there in the heather in the early Seventies, while Linda took her photographs of him and the children.

For generations, rich Englishmen have bought great estates in Scotland, and taken their smart friends up to shoot the animals and birds.

But toffing and killing was never the McCartneys’ way. And the local people admired them for it.

Animals were never shot at High Park Farm: quite the reverse. It was while having Sunday lunch with the children, watching young lambs bouncing happily in the field, that the entire family suddenly pushed aside the roast on their plates and decided to become vegetarians.

Later Linda, with an evangelistic fervour, would create a whole range of vegetarian foods.

The west of Scotland wasn’t the handiest place for an international rock star to bring up his family, so another estate was found in Sussex.

There, once again, the McCartneys started with a small house followed by a much bigger one and more and more land was added. But always their homestead on the Mull of Kintyre was waiting for holidays.

Then, in 1998, Linda died, and the visits to High Park Farm became fewer. In his solitude, the memories of a family starting out 30 years earlier in this place of romantic isolation would have both comforted him and lanced the pain of his loss.

By now, all the McCartney children were grown up with their own lives to lead. The Scottish farm had been a part of Paul’s life with Linda. Without her, it wasn’t the same.

Now he has a new American wife and life and several other homes, even his helicopter visits to his Sussex house are fewer, and he’s rarely been busier. This week he’s flitting from TV studio to radio microphone promoting a new album.

Speaking about his country life, he once told me: ‘I do all the things everybody else does. The only difference is I’m more famous and richer than they are.’ And, like all of us, it seems to me that Paul is moving on, as he has to, as we all have to — though it isn’t easy.

How many of us think fondly of our childhood home, picturing its cosiness, almost smelling the polish on the furniture?

Or do we see home as the sanctuary we decorated as  newly-weds, where we ladled Polyfilla into gaps in the plaster, then later watched as our young children rolled and giggled on our proud new carpets?

We think we’d like to go back, but we know we can’t.

As Paul McCartney is no longer the 26-year-old restarting his life in the ‘mists that rolled in from the sea’, as he told us in Mull Of Kintyre, we are not the same people we were either.

Time changes us and the people we shared those moments of our lives with have changed, too; some to leave us, some to grow up, some sadly to die.

And without those loved ones, the place will neither look nor feel the same.

Often, against your better judgment, you revisit a place you loved 20 years ago — only to be confronted by a noisy holiday village and  sun-worshippers occupying almost every grain of sand.

Obviously, it’s good that more people can enjoy the sunshine, the sea and the sun, you might try to think, but, in your heart you’re with Joni Mitchell when she sang: ‘They paved paradise, put up a parking lot.’

In truth, we shouldn’t even try to go back. It rarely works, seductive though the memories may be. The word in Scotland is that Paul McCartney wants to discuss with the Forestry Commission new ways to manage his land.

Does that mean he wants to turn it back to the historic, natural woodland it would have been before sheep farming overran Scotland,  as some environmentalists  now advocate?

It wouldn’t surprise me. But we’ll have to wait and see.

In the meantime, though the ‘smiles in the sunshine and tears in the rain’ he once sang about are long behind him, the memories of Mull will remain.

He, like us, will always have the memories, often better preserved if we don’t try to relive them.As for the staff about to lose their jobs at High Park Farm, I’m sure a comfortable compensation will be negotiated.
