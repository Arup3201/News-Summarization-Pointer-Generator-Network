A reclusive pensioner died surrounded by a huge pile of rubbish that he had been hoarding - and his body was not found until police broke down his door eight months later.

Denis Walsby, 74, who had not had contact with his family for years, was found lying underneath a stack of papers at the foot of his stairs, with bags of rubbish and cardboard boxes packed in around him.

The police officer who uncovered the decomposing body described the scene as being 'like a nest' where Mr Walsby had collected, and kept, everything that he needed.

Hoarder: Plastic bags and cardboard boxes filled with junk were stacked so high in Denis Walsby's house that the police officer who discovered his body found it difficult to open the front door

During the inquest at Southampton Coroners' Court, it emerged that Mr Walsby was living downstairs among the clutter in his terraced house in Romsey, Hampshire during the final months of his life.

Dates on the piles of mail found in his home indicated that Mr 
Walsby could have died in April last year - eight months before he was found dead - the court heard.

The alarm was raised when a postman saw mail piled up inside the porch at his home in Romsey, Hampshire.

PC Lindsay Miell, who found Mr Walsby's body, noticed an infestation of flies upon entering the property.

She said: 'It was hugely cluttered to the point that I couldn’t step inside the doorway.

'The thing that immediately struck me was the smell. It appeared in the last stages of his life that he had created a small nest for himself - it was where he had basically done everything.'

Mr Walsby had not had contact with any family for years and had not been in touch with his ex-wife Joyce, 69, for 30 years.

Joyce, from Southampton, said they had moved to the then new-build home in 1970 when they were both working for Ordnance Survey. The couple divorced in 1982 and his ex-wife said that she had not spoken to Mr Walsby since he retired in 1984.

It was only after Mr Walsby died that she met his cousin, Robert Lucas, who it appears is his last surviving relative.

Mr Walsby would holiday in Germany and would visit Mr Lucas at his home in Camberley, Surrey, on his way home.

He was last seen at a family funeral in 2001 and Mr Lucas last spoke to him in 2006.

Little is known about the last ten years of his life. Richard Heather, of Hampshire taxi firm Samtax, took Mr Walsby on weekly shopping trips.

He said: 'He never used to complain about his health.'

Mr Walsby’s neighbour, Karen Stewart, also said she had knocked on his front door several times each year.

She said would only see him once every few months and could have been the last person to have spoken to him.

She said: 'I felt so awful when I heard that he’d died, I was in tears.'

A post-mortem found that Mr Walsby had died from a head injury although it is uncertain how he sustained it.

Delivering a verdict of accidental death, Central Hampshire coroner Grahame Short said: 'Because of the period of time which has elapsed, it’s not possible to ascertain whether he had been drinking, for example, and then fallen, or if he had a fall because he tripped.

'He was clearly a very reclusive man who preferred his own company.'
