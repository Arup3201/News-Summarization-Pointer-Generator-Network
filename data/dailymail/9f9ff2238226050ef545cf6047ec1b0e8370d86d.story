Romelu Lukaku says he has not spoken with Jose Mourinho nor Chelsea about his future but that he wants to be at a club where he can play regularly and win titles.

The Belgian striker, who came on in his country’s quarter-final defeat against Argentina on Saturday, was loaned to Everton last season.

Even though Mourinho was clearly dissatisfied with his choice of strikers — Fernando Torres, Samuel Eto’o and Demba Ba — he allowed Lukaku to go to Goodison Park where he was a success under Roberto Martinez, scoring 16 goals.

But Lukaku says there have been no talks about his future at Chelsea and he is unsure where he will be next season. ‘I have a few ideas but we’ll see,’ said Lukaku. ‘I have to think about it.

‘I want to be somewhere where I can play my best football and hopefully win titles. There are choices to make. Things like that happen in football and I’m confident I will make the right choice.’ 

Asked whether he had spoken to anyone at Chelsea since he left to go on loan, he said: ‘No, not yet. It depends what is the best for me, where the most ambition is and where is the best place for me to do develop as a young player.

‘I’m still 21 but I think I’m experienced enough. I’ve played a lot of games and scored a lot of goals, now I want to win titles and be one of the best.’ 

Lukaku was dropped from Belgium’s starting 11 at the World Cup for Divock Origi, who is in negotiations for a £10m move to Liverpool from Lille, but could be loaned back to the French club next season. Origi said: ‘I don’t know yet if I will move. We’ll see.’
