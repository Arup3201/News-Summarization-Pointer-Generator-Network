Justin Bieber has inspired more ill will among Americans than the radical group Muslim Brotherhood - at least according to the popularity of a White House petition calling for the deportation of the troubled Canadian singer.

The petition created by a Detroit resident asking to eject 19-year-old pop star from the U.S. and have his green card revoked has drawn nearly 261,000 signatures as of Friday morning, becoming the second most popular cause in the three-year history of the White House site.

At 204,500 signatures, a petition to declare the extremist Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization is a distant second, followed by a plea to pardon CIA leaker Edward Snowden in third with 153,000 signatures.

Unpopular: A petition on the White House website calling to deport Canadian teen idol Justin Bieber and have his green card revoked has become the second most popular plea ever

Legal trouble: The 'Slow Down' singer was arrested last month for allegedly drag-racing a Lamborghini while drunk in Miami Beach

The only petition to draw more attention than the Bieber deportation push was the 2012 plea to declare Westboro Baptist Church a hate group in response to their anti-gay protests at military funerals, Washington Times reported.

According to the policy of the website launched in 2011, any petition that raises 100,000 signatures in 30 days must be taken under consideration by the Obama administration - a threshold that the Bieber plea easily met last month. 

The call to action was made January 23 by Robert Skryzynski, 24, of Detroit, following Bieber's humiliating arrest for allegedly drag-racing a Lamborghini under the influence and with an expired license in Miami Beach.

'We the people of the United States feel that we are being wrongly represented in the world of pop culture. We would like to see the dangerous, reckless, destructive, and drug abusing, Justin Bieber deported and his green card revoked,' the petition reads.

'He is not only threatening the safety of our people but he is also a terrible influence on our nations youth. We the people would like to remove Justin Bieber from our society.'

Skyzynski later explained that he used the tongue-in-cheek plea to kick Bieber out of the country as a way to draw attention to the problems with the White House petition portal, which he said foreign powers have been using to jockey for the attention of the U.S. government.

‘I feel like I finally brought America together on an issue for once,’ Mr. Skrzynski quipped to The Washington Times this week.

The White House has said that it will issue an official response to the Bieber petition now that it has raised more than the required 100,000 signatures, but there is no timetable yet for when the statement will come.

Historically, the administration has been slow to respond to petitions, and the responses are usually formulaic and of little note.

But the signatories of the White House plea are evidently not the only ones who wish to see Bieber pack up his bags and hit the road north.

High stakes: This electronic billboard went up in Chicago this week ahead of Friday's U.S.-Canada hockey game

A company in Illinois has paid for a large billboard ahead of today's high-stake hockey game between the U.S. and Canada in Sochi poking fun at the star-crossed teen idol, as DNAInfo Chicago first reported. 

The electronic advertisement, which went up along Edens Expressway in Chicago, depicts the singer flanked by Team USA's  Patrick Kane and Team Canada's Jonathan Toews with a caption that reads: 'Loser Keep Bieber.'

As luck would have it, the U.S. will get to keep the singer after all: Team USA lost to Canadians 1-0 Friday.

The 'Baby' singer, who turns 20 next month, has had a particularly rough year, which included an arrest in Canada for an assault on a limo driver, allegations that he had egged his neighbor's home in California, and a series of salacious tales of his one-night-stands.
