Former football coach Shane Hughes, who is accused of repeatedly raping a 12-year-old girl 

A former Chelsea children's football coach has appeared in court accused of repeatedly raping a 12-year-old girl.

Shane Hughes, who is believed to have worked for the Premier League club's Community Foundation, faces 14 counts of raping the girl.

The alleged rapes dates back to 2011 and relate to one female victim, who is now aged 16.

The 30-year-old, wearing a blue suit, with a white shirt and no tie, stood emotionless in the dock while Guildford Crown Court heard the charges laid out against him.

Judge Christopher Critchlow said the charges against Hughes relate to when he was a football coach.

He explained: 'These are allegation concerning his role as a football coach and what he did in that capacity.'

The court was also told that Hughes, of Lenham in Kent will deny the charges against him.

Gordon Ross, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant at the moment faces 14 charges of rape in relation to a claimant under the age of 13.

'The incidents date back to 2011 and thereafter.

'The early indication is that this will be a contested matter with a complete denial of any sexual activity.'

Hughes was granted conditional bail to return to Guildford Crown Court on May 22 for a plea and case management hearing.

An order was made banning Hughes from contacting the alleged girl victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons.

Formed in 2010, the Chelsea Foundation is an independent charity working within the community, which includes coaching courses for children. 

The club have declined to comment on the case but a source told the Sun on Sunday: 'He had worked for the foundation and not for the club or its youth set-up directly.' 

The case continues.
