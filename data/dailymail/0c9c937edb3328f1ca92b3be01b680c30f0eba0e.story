The so-called 'Naked Rambler' Stephen Gough refused to put on clothes during a court appearance today telling the judge being nude gives him 'freedom.'

The 53-year-old, from Eastleigh in Hampshire, earned the nickname by walking unclothed from Land’s End to John O’Groats after quitting his job as a lorry driver.

Appearing at
Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court ahead of his trial later this month, he told Sheriff Richard McFarlane that he would 'absolutely not' put 
clothes on as he was 'dressed appropriately' wearing nothing at all.

Staying true to his beliefs: The former Royal Marine, 53, appeared naked at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court ahead of his trial later this month, following his arrest on July 20th in Townhill, Dunfermline

The former Royal Marine was charged with breach of the peace, 
with prosecutors claiming he refused to put on clothing or move away 
from a children’s play park in Townhill, Dunfermline last month.

Gough entered the court naked, apart from 
brown walking boots and a pair of white socks, and was lead to the dock 
where he sat down on a white bath towel.

Sheriff McFarlane said to Gough: 'You appear unclothed. Is there a reason for that? Can you tell me what that might be?'

Gough replied: 'Freedom.'

The
Sheriff said: 'That’s not appropriate in a court of law, there are 
standards that need to be adhered to and that does not meet those.

He told Gough that he could be charged with  a contempt of court, but the naked ramber insisted 'I think I am dressed appropriately.'

Naked and proud: Gough, from Eastleigh in Hampshire, who made his name by walking nude from Land's End to John O'Groats in 2003

To which the Sheriff replied: 'You’re not dressed at all.'

But Gough insisted: 'And I think that is appropriate.'

When Sheriff
McFarlane asked Gough to reconsider his decision to stand in court naked, Gough refused to change his stance, adding: 'I will not put clothes on, absolutely not.'

Depute fiscal Brian Robertson said 
that he would not take action in the contempt matter, leaving the matter
to the Sheriff instead.

But told the court that the crown was prepared for trial.

Sheriff McFarlane asked Gough if he would like to see a lawyer, in light of the contempt matters.

But the rambler insisted he didn’t need to see a lawyer, and was sticking to his plea of not guilty.

It
is alleged that in July this year,  Gough committed a breach of the peace by conducting himself in
a disorderly manner and walking naked in a public place.

It
is claimed that he was close to a children’s play park at the time, and
refused to put on clothing or move away from the park.

In trouble with the law: Gough went on to be arrested and jailed on a number of occasions for walking naked, and refusing to get dressed in court

Gough, who has received 17 convictions in 10 years, came to notoriety during his naked walk from Land’s End to John O’Groats in 2003.

He went on to be arrested and jailed on a number of occasions for walking naked, and refusing to get dressed in court. 

He was released from Perth Prison in July  having spent the past six years in the Scottish jail, but was arrested three days later.

Previousky he was arrested within 60 seconds of his release and fully expected the police to do so again.But, in an apparent shift in attitude, the rambler had been allowed to go on his way.

On a flight to Scotland in May 2006 he was detained for a breach of the peace after he went to the toilet and removed his clothes.

He had been in prison ever since - although he has spent minutes at a time out of custody before being re-arrested for being naked - until his release last Tuesday.

His former partner, Alison Ward, 47, who lived with Gough and their two children, Yarin, 14, and Kiana, 16, in Vancouver, said at the weekend she was 'amazed' that he had been arrested again, saying 'he’s a fanatic about nudism.'

Ms Ward, said that it was 'really disappointing' for her and the children that they wouldn’t be able to see him.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
