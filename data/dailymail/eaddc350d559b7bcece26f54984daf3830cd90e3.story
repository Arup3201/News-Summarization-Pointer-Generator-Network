Passengers who had been warned of lengthy delays at Heathrow due to striking workers today said border controls were 'better than usual'.

As Border Agency bosses were forced to take on regular airport workers to man passport control, delighted passengers said queues had been shorter than normal.

The situation was echoed at Dover too as passengers faced apparently normal travel conditions with ferry services 'running 
well and to time' this morning.

Meanwhile, millions of children have stayed at home as more than half of England's 21,700 state schools closed. Thousands of NHS operations and appointments have also been cancelled.

'Better than usual': Terminal 3 at Heathrow as arrivals and departures were largely unaffected by today's strike, with just a few cancellations of inbound transatlantic flights

Back at Heathrow airport chiefs had even laid on free food and water, expecting passengers to be delayed by hours.

Debbie Arnell, a 42-year-old apprenticeship assessor from Bournemouth who had flown back to Heathrow's terminal five after a holiday in Philadelphia, said there appeared to be 'more staff than usual' at passport control.

She said: 'I've used this terminal seven times before and today was better than usual.

'They were even giving out free fruit and water, which they don't usually do. It's almost like they have over-compensated.'

Richard Bunkham, a 45-year-old human 
resources consultant from London, also said queues at Heathrow's 
passport control had been 'negligible'.

Mr
 Bunkham said: 'I use iris recognition so don't usually get held up 
anyway, but you could see that today it was much better than usual.'

Asked what he thought about the 
strike, Mr Bunkham said: 'I think the private sector should also be 
taking action. I would ask for private sector pensions to be upgraded 
rather than public sector pensions downgraded.'.

Noel
 West, 58, from Brighton, who came into Terminal three from Miami, said:
 'It proves that we do not need half of these people if you can go 
through as quickly as I did when there is as strike on.

'It was the fastest I have ever come 
through passport control. They were really prepared and there were lines
 showing you where to go depending on what passport holder you are way 
before there usually is.

'But
 they did look like they were preparing for long queues later in the day
 - they had spare chairs, special invalid chairs, water and biscuits to 
eat.'

Daily Mail showbiz editor Sara Nathan
 added: 'Heathrow is as dead as a zombie. No queues at immigration at 
all - but they've laid out water, apples and Kit-Kats just in case.'

Belgian
 carrier Brussels Airlines cancelled one of its Heathrow to Brussels 
services today, while Middle East airline Etihad Airways and Greek 
carrier Aegean Airlines had already announced they were scrapping some 
services to and from Heathrow.

No problems: Passengers had been warned to face queues and airport bosses had even prepared free food and water

An information sign at Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport. Passengers were warned yesterday there could be delays of up to three hours

BAA has asked airlines to fly planes into the airport only half full while the strike is on.

A spokesman said: 'We have deployed over 400 additional customer services staff within our terminals.

'They
 are giving 24 hour support to passengers, providing information, food, 
drink and children’s activity packs. They are equipped with iPads and 
Blackberries to keep passengers up to date.'

Airport bosses yesterday warned passengers to be prepared for lengthy queues as they arrived in the country.

Critics
 feared that the Border Agency walkout would lead to holes in the 
nation's security and terrorists and criminals could sneak into the 
country unnoticed.

So far this morning no problems have been reported and airport staff said queues were at 'normal levels'.

Vets are believed to be among the civil servants who have been drafted in to help man the borders, according to The Sun newspaper.

Drafted in staff were believed to have had limited training 
on how to operate the airport's database containing information on 
terrorists and criminals. 

Border staff are among up to two million public sector workers believed to have walked out of their jobs in
 protest over pension reforms.

At Heathrow and Gatwick this morning planes arriving and taking-off at have been largely unaffected.

There were just a handful of cancellations of inbound transatlantic flights to Heathrow earlier.

Heathrow operator BAA, and its 
busiest carrier, British Airways, both reported near-normal services, 
with queues at immigration no longer than usual.

And
 at the second-busiest UK airport - Gatwick in West Sussex - the first 
22 inbound flights arrived as normal, with departures also running 
smoothly.

No delays: Arrivals halls at Heathrow Airport were today eerily quiet as passengers breezed through passport control

It is not yet known how many airport staff have walked out but a British Airways spokesman said there were reports around two-thirds of UKBA staff were working.

The airport's 10 EU UK desks at 
Terminal 3 immigration are being manned by mix of home office staff and 
police officers who have been trained, the BBC said.

Five non EU desks are open as airport sources suggest immigration controls are at two thirds of normal staffing levels.

A British Airways spokesman said: 'We've had a positive start to the day and queues are pretty much as normal.

'There are reports that around two-thirds of the Border Agency staff are working at Heathrow.'

A BAA spokesman said: 'Due to the 
effective contingency plans we have put in place with the airlines and 
the UKBA over recent days, immigration queues are currently at normal 
levels. However, there still remains a possibility of delays for 
arriving passengers later in the day.

'As a result of the whole airport community working together over the 
past few days, we have more immigration officers on duty and fewer 
passengers arriving than would otherwise be the case. That puts us in a 
better place to avoid the serious delays and widespread disruption at 
Heathrow that were projected last week.'

A spokesman for Gatwick said the airport 
was expecting delays today for incoming passengers through passport 
control, but no hold ups had occurred yet this morning.

The Port of Dover in Kent said all services with P&O Ferries to Calais and DFDS Seaways sailings to Dunkirk were 'running well and to time' this morning with space available.

There were no queues on roads leading into the port.

Freight and car traffic boarding cross-Channel ferries were told not to expect delays on their outbound journeys but could face disruption on their return to Dover.

The Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union said it believed border controls were being manned by a 'hastily gathered' group of police officers, private contractors and volunteers with little training.

Meanwhile millions of children have stayed at home today as teachers and heads take to the picket lines, affecting three in four schools, according to early Government figures. However, it is feared this number could rise.

The Department for Education (DfE) said it believed that more than half of England's 21,700 state schools - 58 per cent - are closed, with a further 13 per cent partially shut. About 13 per cent are open, the DfE said, while the rest are unknown.

Schools in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are also expected to be affected.

Thousands of NHS operations and appointments have been cancelled and rescheduled too as a result of today's strike.

NHS trusts across the country have written to patients informing them not to come in, although they are still providing emergency and critical care.

The picture varies across the UK, with some trusts expecting major disruption and others working as close to normal as possible.

In England, the Government estimates around 60,000 non-urgent operations, out-patient appointments, tests and follow-up appointments have been postponed while in Scotland at least 3,000 operations and thousands more hospital appointments are affected.
