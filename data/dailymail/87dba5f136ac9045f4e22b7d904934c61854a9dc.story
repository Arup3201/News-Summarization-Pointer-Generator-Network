Marvin Gaye's family have filed an injunction in court on Tuesday that could end the sale and distribution of 'Blurred Lines' - the wildly successful song that they claim was ripped off of the 1977 hit 'Got to Give it Up.'

The injunction by Nona Gaye, Frankie Gaye and Marvin Gaye III would prevent the copying, distributing and performing of the hit single featuring Robin Thicke, Pharrell Williams, and T.I.

Williams and Thicke were ordered to pay nearly $7.4million to the three children after a jury determined last week that Blurred Lines copied elements of Gaye's song.

Thicke's Blurred Lines was the biggest hit of 2013 and it sold more than seven million tracks in the United States

Gaye's family also sought Tuesday to amend the verdict to include rapper T.I. - whose real name is Clifford Joseph Harris Jr - as well as labels Universal Music, Interscope Records and Star Trak Entertainment.

The injunction against Blurred Lines could give Gaye's family leverage to negotiate for royalties and other concessions, such as songwriting credits.

The family said in a statement released Wednesday: 'With the digital age upon us, the threat of greater infringement looms for every artist.

'It is our wish that our dad's legacy, and all great music, past, present, and future, be enjoyed and protected, with the knowledge that adhering to copyright standards assures our musical treasures will always be valued.'

The children claim the lawsuit could have been avoided if Thicke and Williams had spoken with the family before the song was released, The Wrap reported. 

The family said: 'Like most artists, they could have licensed and secured the song for appropriate usage.

'This did not happen. 

'We would have welcomed a conversation with them before the release of their work. 

'This also did not happen.'

Blurred Lines was the biggest hit of 2013. 

It sold more than seven million tracks in the United States, topped the pop charts for months and earned two Grammy Award nominations.
