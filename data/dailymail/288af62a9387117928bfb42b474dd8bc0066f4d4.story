The personal details of 31 world leaders including Barack Obama and David Cameron were mistakenly leaked by an organiser of Australia's G20 summit, it was reported today.

An employee of the Australian immigration department accidentally e-mailed a member of the Asian Cup football organising committee a cache of sensitive data including passport and visa numbers.

But in a letter to the Australian privacy commissioner revealing the blunder, the director of the visa services division did not consider it necessary to inform those world leaders of the privacy breach.

The Guardian reported that an Australian immigration official accidentally e-mailed the passport numbers, visa details and other information about world leaders to an Asian Cup organiser on November 7.

Other leaders who came to Brisbane for the November 15-16 event and whose information was exposed included German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, it said.

The newspaper said details obtained under Australia's freedom of information laws showed data relating to 31 international leaders was mistakenly emailed to the wrong person due to human error.

The mistake arose after the immigration worker failed to check that the autofill function on the email system had addressed the email correctly, it said.

The immigration officer recommended that the world leaders not be notified of the breach because the e-mail had been deleted and 'actions... taken to limit the further distribution of the email.' 

Australia's deputy opposition leader, Tanya Plibersek, called on Prime Minister Tony Abbott to answer why the world leaders were not notified of the breach.

'The prime minister and the immigration minister must explain this serious incident and the decision not to inform those affected,' she told The Guardian. 

Australia's immigration department today confirmed there had been a data breach, but gave no details and did not say whether the world leaders had since been informed.

'The breach was immediately referred to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner,' a spokeswoman for the Department of Immigration and Border Protection said in a statement.

'The data was immediately deleted by the recipient and was not distributed further.'  

Australia hosted the Asian Cup in January.

The Australian immigration spokeswoman said the department had reviewed and strengthened its email protocols to limit and contain future breaches.
