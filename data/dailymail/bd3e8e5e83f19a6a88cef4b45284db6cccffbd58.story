A hiker has revealed the toll a 2,650-mile trek had on his body by snapping a selfie mile-by-mile.

Andy Davidhazy, 47, from Texas, embarked on the mighty Pacific Crest Trail in 2013 and spent five-and-a-half months zigzagging his way from Mexico to Canada.

During his journey he lost 50lbs as he walked his way through five pairs of shoes. His complexion also got all the more rugged as he experienced undulating temperatures, weather, and terrain.

This week, after compiling all of his selfies together, he released time-lapse video of his expedition with the footage offering a fascinating glimpse into the grueling challenge he embraced.

Caught on camera: Andy Davidhazy, 47, from Texas, embarked on the mighty Pacific Crest Trail in 2013 and spent five-and-a-half months zigzagging his way from Mexico to Canada - he took a selfie mile-by-mile to document his transformation

At the starting point Davidhazy appears slightly chubby-cheeked with his hair neatly cut.

But as the miles go on, the stubble begins to grow and Davidhazy's face gets increasingly gaunter. 

At one point he appears with a full beard and in another shot he seems to have a touch of sunburn.

The selfies also reveal several of Davidhazy's must-have items.

In almost all of the images a water bottle appears attached to his rucksack strap.

In hotter climates, the hat and sunglasses come out and in rainier climates an anorak comes into play.

In some scenes other trekkers are seen lurking in the background but for the most-part Davidhazy appears alone.

In a bid to keep his sanity, it appears Davidhazy listened to music as in several selfies headphones are seen plugged into his ears.

Davidhazy said that he actually completed the Pacific Crest Trail in two stages as snow prevented him from doing it in one go. 

He stopped at mile 2,424 and took a detour leading him back around to a trailhead.

Although Davidhazy found taking selfies 'distracting', he said looking back he was glad he did it.

'It provided a good conversation starter with so many hikers that I would meet along the way,' he said of his photo ritual. 

'And I now love seeing so many wonderful faces popping up in pictures in unexpected places.'

Davidhazy kept track of where he was using paper maps, a mobile app with GPS and a watch.

After a while, he found a mile generally took him 18 to 22 minutes to hike.

During his mammoth walk, Davidhazy said he encountered one wolf, five black bears, dozens of rattlesnakes and countless creepy crawlies.

He now plans to make a feature film documenting his life-changing trip, called Lost or Found. 

Summing up the voyage he said: 'It was the hardest simple thing I could think of.'
