The woman accused of killing the young wife of a US Marine pleaded not guilty to murder charges Thursday.

Prosecutors offered no details of the motive Jessica Lynn Lopez, 25, had to allegedly harm Brittany, Dawn Killgore, 22, whose body was discovered in brush near a lake in San Diego, California.

However, Lopez's neighbor claims she and Mrs Killgore were involved in a dangerous sex ring, playing sex slaves.

A second Marine, Louis Ray Perez, who has been named a person of interest, has not been charged with the murder. He is currently in jail, facing charges he stole an assault rifle.

Tragic: The body of Brittany Killgore was discovered on Tuesday, four days after she was last seen with a marine who was later arrested on an unrelated charge

Suspect: Authorities believe that the victim knew Jessica Lynn Lopez (pictured here), and the two were involved in some kind of sex slave ring

Lopez, who pleaded not guilty Thursday, was discovered with the note in a San Diego hotel room, prosecutor Patrick Espinoza said. No further details were released about the note.

Authorities said earlier this week that paramedics hospitalized Lopez after finding her with self-inflicted cuts in the room but didn't disclose the suicide note. Within hours of finding Lopez, searchers discovered the body of Killgore.

Bail for Lopez was set at $3 million at her arraignment in Vista Superior Court, north of San Diego.

Lopez's attorney Dean Broyles said he didn't know if his client knew Perez or Mrs Killgore, who was reported missing Saturday -- one day after Lopez turned 25.

'There's a lot of speculation, a lot of innuendo, a lot of weak allegations and charges out there,' he said.

'I would caution everyone to not jump to conclusions and prejudge based on all the information flying around right now.'

Mr Broyles said Lopez would ask the judge for a public defender after her family sought his help in fielding media questions. Lopez's parents, who live in nearby Escondido, released a statement saying they loved their daughter.

'We pray for the family of Brittany Killgore and ask that the Lord comfort them during their time of grief and anguish,' the parents said.

'We ask that you pray for all of those impacted by this tragic situation, including our family.'

Authorities have not disclosed Mrs Killgore, Lopez, and Perez are connected.

A neighbour, who declined to be identified, toldÂ ABC 10 that both Lopez and the victim took part in some kind of sex ring.

She said: 'They're into the sex slave things... I try not to judge, but that's what they're into.'

Perez, 45, pleaded not guilty 
on Wednesday to stealing a AR-15 rifle from Camp Pendleton. Investigators have given few 
details about that case, and it was not known if they suspect the weapon
was tied to Killgore's death.

Perez was being held on $500,000 
bond. His attorney Jeffrey Reichert said his client has no criminal 
history, is married and has lived in San Diego County for 10 years.

Missing: Brittany Killgore lived in Fallbrook, California, not far from Camp Pendleton

Lopez's bail was set at $3 million.

Mrs Killgore went missing shortly after 
filing for divorce from her husband, Cory Killgore a 22-year-old Marine deployed to 
Afghanistan.

Her body was found in brush near Lake Skinner in Riverside 
County about 25 miles northeast of her modest, two-story apartment in 
Fallbrook, a San Diego County community known for its avocado orchards.

Killgore lived a short walk from an 
entrance to Camp Pendleton, and her complex - like others around it - is
full of Marines and their families who tend to be short-term residents 
and often don't get to know each other well.

Fears: Cory, right, is returning from Afghanistan after hearing about the disappearance of his wife, left

Killgore's husband, Lance Corporal 
Cory Killgore, flew back to California after learning his wife was
missing. Sheriff's authorities say he is not a suspect.

The couple from Missouri were married
in July 2010. Brittany Killgore filed for divorce April 10 and listed 
'irreconcilable differences' as the reason. She gave no details on the 
paperwork.

Her cellphone was found in the Gaslamp District of downtown San Diego, an area populated with bars and restaurants.

Darryl J Wrest of Rolla, Missouri, 
confirmed Brittany Killgore is his daughter but said he was not 
commenting on anything at this time. Killgore's other family members 
also declined to comment.

Authorities investigating the homicide said a suicide note
of the prime suspect contained key details about the case, including 
the location of a body.

Serious: The Fallbrook scene where Louis Ray Perez is being questioned in connection with the disappearance

Authorities in California are now reportedly examining a possible link between Killgore, the suspect, and a seedy sex ring.

ABC 10 reported that officers later responded to a Ramada Inn near the San Diego Airport, 
where they found a woman with stab wounds all over her body in an 
apparent suicide attempt.

That woman, 27-year-old Lopez, was arrested at the scene but hospitalised at UCSD Medical Center.

She was discharged from the hospital on Wednesday, and charged with murder in Killgore's death.

Cory Killgore was deployed to Afghanistan earlier this year as a vehicle operator.
