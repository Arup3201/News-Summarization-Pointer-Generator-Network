A man who ate more than 15 stone of Sugar Puffs a year has lost nine stone in sixth months after completely cutting the cereal from his diet.

Andy Mack, 39, from Wigan, Greater Manchester, used to weigh 29 stone and ate three family size boxes a week - more than 150 every year.

Mr Mack said this was a major reason for his original weight gain but he has now shed the pounds after replacing Sugar Puffs with a more healthy breakfast.

Andy Mack's old diet consisted of 15 stone worth of Sugar Puffs a year and massive portions of rice and pasta. He has now lost nine stone in six months after cutting out the cereal and exercising more

Mr Mack said: 'I was told cereal was a healthy breakfast so I thought I could eat as much of it as I liked.

'I’d often find myself refilling my mammoth bowl just to make sure I felt full.'

Mr Mack believes that it wasn't just the Sugar Puffs that had an effect - he also consumed a huge number of snacks throughout the day.

He said: 'I pretty much had the diet of an elephant. I thought I was eating well.

'When I fancied a snack I would have an apple. But I never just ate one apple, I would eat about eight apples in a row.

'After that I would have five bananas to fill myself up.'

Andy Mack used to eat three family sized boxes of Sugar Puffs a week, thinking that because 'eating cereal was healthy' he could eat as much as he wanted

Now that he has given up the cereal, he has lost around nine stone due to his new diet

Breakfast: A portion of Sugar Puffs in a fruit bowl - and possibly seconds.

Snacks: Six or seven apples back-to-back, followed by four or five bananas.

Lunch: A sandwich with four slices of bread instead of two. Fillings comprised of meat and cheese with mayonnaise or salad cream.

Afternoon snack: Six or seven apples back-to-back, followed by four or five bananas.

Dinner: Massive portion of rice or pasta with pasta sauce or meat - sometimes followed by a second serving.

Once a week: A takeaway with all the sides, starters and extras available

Alcohol: 15-20 pints on one night a week

Exercise: Minimal

Breakfast: No cereal, instead he has a light breakfast controlled by his fitness program

Snacks: None

Lunch: A sensibly portioned light lunch, with healthy fillings if it is a sandwich. Otherwsie he has a salad.

Afternoon snack: None

Dinner: A sensibly portioned dinner of regular food, such as pasta or rice, but limited to one serving and a regular sized portion.

Takeaways are off the menu

Alcohol: None

Exercise: Andy now trains four times a week for an hour at a time at his gym - this includes cycling, running, weights and a mixture of cardio and free weight lifting

When it came to dinner, Mr Mack once again piled his plate high thinking he was being healthy.

He said: 'On certain diets things like pasta and rice are "free foods" so I thought there was no limit on the amount I could eat.

Andy Mack has been compared to the Honey Monster, the popular mascot of Sugar Puffs cereal

'My portion sizes were as big as my head. I would have seconds too.

'The trouble is, the more you eat the more you want.'

Mr Mack had always been overweight but had ridden bikes to keep his fitness levels up.

So when an opportunity arose for him to do a bike ride last year in support of a charity set up by family friends, following their young son Jack’s diagnosis with a rare illness, he jumped at the chance.

But he soon found that his weight was holding him back.

He said: 'I thought it would be a ride in the park but I seriously struggled. This race nearly broke me.

'It
 took me 10 hours to complete the race which took the average person 
only six. I didn’t think I was going to make it to the finish line.

'I was so shocked at how much I struggled, I knew I had to do something.

'I decided I would lose this weight I had been carrying around for years and sort myself out.'

Mr Mack set himself a target to lose nine stone in six months to raise money for the charity.

Andy Mack (before his diet, left) struggled to ride his bike when he was at his heaviest and realised he had to start training (right). He now exercises more and has cut his portion sizes dramatically

He said: 'My friend Nick Wilkinson is a previous big weight loss loser and he came up with the idea that I should lose the weight for the "Joining Jack" charity.'

Mr Mack, who plays in a pub band, would get free drinks during a gig, and would sometimes drink 20 pints in one night

The charity was set up by friends Alex and Andy Johnson, whose son suffers from the rare muscle wasting condition Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, which affects one in approximately 3500 boys worldwide and currently has no cure.

They are hoping to raise money to find a treatment for the disease and Mr Mack's massive weight loss has helped in a huge way.

He has raised £7,300 for the charity, at the same time as shedding nine stone in six months.

Mr Mack said: 'I have drastically changed my diet and I have my portion sizes under control.

'I go train four times a week and follow their strict diet plan.

'No more Sugar Puffs for me.'

His successful loss of nine stone and has taken 14 inches off his waist.

After weighing 28 stone 8 pounds Mr Mack now weighs a much healthier 19 stone.

He said: 'I’ve lost so much weight that people I know don’t even recognise me in the street.

'I just want to be fit and healthy and I am not going to stop until I am just that.

'Raising money for Joining Jack in the process is that added push and keeps me going.'

Mr Mack has signed himself up for the same bike ride challenge he struggled to finish for later this year and is hoping to shave four hours off his current personal best.
