Sentenced: Albrecht Muth, 49, will spend the next 50 years in prison for strangling to death his socialite wife, 91, in 2011

A German man who posed as an Iraqi general and other eccentric characters was sentenced this afternoon to 50 years in prison for the murder of his 91-year-old wife in Washington DC.

Albrecht Muth, 49, was convicted in January of killing his wife, Viola Drath, a German writer and socialite.

She was found dead in the couple's row home in Washington's posh Georgetown neighborhood in August 2011.

Muth told police that he found his wife of 20 years dead in a bathroom, but an investigator concluded Drath's death was staged.

Prosecutors said Muth, who was decades younger than his wife, beat and strangled her and then moved her body.

The 49-year-old convicted killer did not appear physically in court on Wednesday for his sentencing but attended via videoconference from a hospital, the same way he attended his trial.

Muth has been intermittently fasting, and that has left him unable to sit or stand. On Wednesday, he lay in a hospital bed staring at the ceiling for much of the hearing, with a blanket partially obscuring his face.

His lawyer, Dana Page, read a statement on his behalf in which he said he was innocent and blamed his wife's death on agents from Iran who were trying to kill him, a claim he has made before.

‘I did not kill my wife,’ he wrote.

But D.C. Superior Court Judge Russell Canan said the evidence of Muth's guilt was ‘overwhelming.’ He said Muth, who has adopted various personas over the years including pretending to be a European count and an Iraqi general, is ‘nothing more than a common domestic serial abuser.’

Canan's sentence means Muth would be older than his wife was when she died if he were ever to be released from prison.

Muth, who prosecutors said was motivated by $200,000 in inheritance money, had claimed that his elderly wife died from a fall in the bathroom, but authorities said her injuries were not consistent with someone who had fallen.

The killing captivated Washington 
because of Drath's longtime connections to the city's diplomatic and 
social circles, and due to revelations in the couple's unconventional 
relationship.

In January, jurors heard about how he masqueraded as a brigadier general in the Iraqi army, strolling around his neighborhood in a uniform he purchased. He also displayed a store-bought military certificate in his home even though he didn't actually have a military background.

Muth's lawyers argued that no physical evidence connected him to the killing and said the case against their client was circumstantial. Muth denied guilt, blaming her death on a botched Iranian hit job targeting him.

Victim: German journalist and socialite Viola Drath was found beaten and strangled in the couple's D.C. home. Prosecutors said that her much-younger husband had sought inheritance money

Prosecutors cited a pattern of verbal and physical abuse toward his wife, including a conviction for assaulting her in 1992.

They said Muth, who lived on a $2,000 monthly allowance from Drath that had recently been reduced by $200, was motivated by money and made a bogus claim to a portion of her estate.

Drath was a journalist who wrote often on German affairs for publications including The Washington Times and Handelsblatt, a German newspaper.

In 1990, following the death of her first husband, she married Muth, who was nearly a half-century younger. The couple lived together in a row home in Georgetown, where they routinely organized dinner parties for dignitaries.

Muth also became romantically involved for several years with a man who eventually sought a restraining order against him in 2004.

On the morning of August 12, 2011, following a night of heavy drinking, Muth called police to report finding his wife dead inside a third-floor bathroom of their home.

Crime scene: The investigation began after Muth reported finding Drath's body in the bathroom of their home in Georgetown, Washington. He claimed she had fallen but police later ruled it a homicide

He said she had fallen, and investigators initially treated the death as one of natural causes. But the medical examiner's office concluded within days that it was a homicide.

During trial, prosecutors presented graphic 
crime scene photographs of Drath sprawled dead on the bathroom floor 
with what one expert described as a large, bloody gash on her neck and 
another wound on the back of her neck.

Detectives settled on Muth as the suspect after finding no signs of forced entry. They determined only Muth and his wife were home at the time of her death. They also said he presented Drath's daughter with a phony amendment to her will, even though Drath specifically left him out of it.

A forensic investigator said Muth appeared anxious and 
fidgety but otherwise emotionless after she came to the home to take 
photographs and inspect the body.

She said he seemed especially curious 
to know the cause of death and whether any trauma was found that could 
explain it.

After killing Drath, prosecutors said Muth searched the Internet for information about extradition arrangements with Mexico, flights to Iceland and crossing the Canadian border.

One of Drath's daughters, Connie Drath Dwyer, testified that Muth had pressured her mother for money and insisted he be able to keep furniture upon her death.
