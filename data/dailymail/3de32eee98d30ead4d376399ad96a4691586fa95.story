A young beauty therapist died after developing a 'super-efficient' immune system which destroyed her heart.

Catherine Hall, 23, from Blaenau Ffestiniog, North
Wales, fell ill with symptoms similar to norovirus last December while staying with her boyfriend, Chris Hughes.

She went to see a GP who diagnosed viral gastroenteritis and told her drink plenty of fluids.

But on December 19, her condition worsened and her worried boyfriend called for an ambulance.

Tragic: Catherine Hall died two days after suffering flu-like symptoms and bouts of vomiting

Silent killer: Catherine (with boyfriend Chris) had been struck down a virus which left her with inflammation of the heart muscles, known as viral myocarditis

She died at the Ysbyty Gwynedd 
hospital in Bangor two days later.

An initial post-mortem examination 
came back inconclusive. But it later emerged she had been struck down a virus which left her with inflammation of the heart muscles, known as viral myocarditis.

In an attempt to get rid of the virus, her body released anti-bodies which not only went after the virus  making her ill, but also attacked her heart muscle cells.

A pathologist said it was 'simply bad 
luck' her body's immune system had attacked her heart.

Myocarditis can develop at the same time or just after a viral infection and is a major cause of sudden adult death syndrome.

An inquest was told that Catherine, who was known as Cathy, was a qualified beauty therapist who and saving to open her own salon.

She was said to be a 'happy, lively and optimistic person who lived life to the full'.

At the hearing, pathologist Dr Mark Lord was questioned about Cathy's immune system.

He replied: 'It's not a defect. It's the immune system being super efficient in the destruction of the virus but the heart muscle is destroyed as well.'

In an attempt to get rid of the virus, Catherine's body released anti-bodies which not only went after the virus making her ill, but attacked her heart muscle cells, too

Sorely missed: Catherine was described as a 'happy, lively and optimistic person who lived life to the full'

Recording a verdict of death by natural causes, North West Wales coroner Dewi Pritchard Jones said: 'It's very unfortunate that her own body recognised her heart cells as being infected by the virus and destroyed them.'

He added that he was satisfied that he was at least able to provide some answers to Cathy's family.

Shortly after Cathy's death, almost 
1,700 people joined a Facebook group in her memory with dozens paying 
their respects to what they described as a 'smiling' young woman who 
would be deeply missed.

At the time, her father, also called 
Chris, said: 'Cathy was caring and also incredibly loyal. Criticise any 
of her friends at your peril, right or wrong, she would always 
vigorously defend them.

'But mostly she was a happy, lively and optimistic person who lived life to the full.'

He said his daughter was a 'caring' 
individual who loved animals and added: 'She was intensely caring and 
compassionate from a very early age.

'My bank statements reveal a random 
selection of orphaned baby elephants, horses and dolphins that I have 
adopted over the years on her behalf.

'She originally wanted to be a vet, 
followed by a marine biologist so that she could work with dolphins, and
subsequently anything to do with horses.'

Myocarditis is a viral infection that leads to inflammation and damage to the heart. The majority of cases clear up within a week, but sometimes the inflammation in the heart lasts longer.

Symptoms include chest pain, fever, an irregular heartbeat and shortness of breath. There’s no reason why someone with an infection may develop myocarditis - it is often a case of bad luck.

Many people don’t realise it, but common bacterial and viral infections such as flu, ear and chest infections, and even the common cold can get into the bloodstream and affect the heart, explains consultant cardiologist Dr Nigel Durham of York Hospital.

‘It’s more widespread than we’d thought  - a quarter of patients we see aged 30 to 35 have evidence of myocarditis, and it is the most common cause of sudden adult death.

Myocarditis can be mild and sometimes resolves itself - if the condition is spotted quickly, anti-inflammatory drugs can treat it. But once the heart muscle becomes enlarged, causing it to stretch, there is little that can be done and it can lead to heart failure.
