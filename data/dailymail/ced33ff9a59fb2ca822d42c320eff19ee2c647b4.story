Millions of pounds in benefits are to be offered to communities to persuade people to agree to new nuclear power stations being built near their homes.

Towns and villages near eight sites in England and Wales will be offered up to £1,000 for every megawatt hour of electricity generated for 40 years.

It means people living near Hinkley Point in Somerset are in line for £128million if a new nuclear generator goes ahead.

Energy minister Michael Fallon insisted it is ‘absolutely essential’ to recognise the contribution towns and villages make to national energy security by having a reactor built nearby.

Under the package, councils would benefit for up to the first 10 years of operation of a nuclear power plant from a share of the increased business rates revenues that will be generated.

Then during the second phase of the programme there would be annual taxpayer-funded payments between 2030 and 2060 from the Department of Energy and Climate Change to communities hosting nuclear power plants.

Mr Fallon said: ‘New nuclear will have a central role to play in our energy strategy, providing heat and light to homes across the country.

‘It is absolutely essential that we recognise the contributions of those communities that host major new energy projects.

‘This package is in the interests of local people, who will manage it to ensure long-term meaningful benefit to the community.

‘It's proportionate to the scale and lifespan of new nuclear power stations and it builds on the major economic benefits they will bring in terms of jobs, investment and use of local services.’

Community benefits packages have been announced for other controversial energy infrastructure, including onshore wind farms and ‘fracking’ for shale gas, but in those cases the developer will pay for them.

David Hall, a county councillor in Somerset, welcome the funds for the area near Hinkley Point. He added: ‘The money is a tremendous asset to our county and will help create jobs and apprenticeships, provide essential improvements like affordable housing and regenerate areas that could really do with financial help.

Construction of the first of a planned new generation of nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point has stalled as EDF and officials have so far failed to agree a price for the electricity which will be generated from the Hinkley Point site.

But Dr Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, said: ‘Whilst wind farms and even shale gas developers have to pay community benefits, only nuclear stations will get a fat taxpayer subsidy to fund them.

‘Our entire energy policy is now absurdly distorted by the desperation to prop up EDF's faltering Hinkley C project, with the Government piling the costs on to the taxpayer to avoid the embarrassment of admitting they backed the wrong technology. We can't go on like this.’
