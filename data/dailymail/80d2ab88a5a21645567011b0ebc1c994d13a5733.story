'Our son Sean, who lives in South Africa, is the father of a 10-month-old child and yesterday it was the first birthday of our granddaughter,' he said. 

'Now there are two others about to be born, as you know! It's amazing! Our grandchildren come fast and furious. Four in a year.'

But to the South African also revealed that he is determined to treat all of his grandchildren equally - whether they have royal blood or not.

'I will respect everything required by the protocol, my daughter knows that, but other than that they will be treated in the same way as their cousins.'

Princess Charlene showed off her baby bump alongside Prince Albert at the Princess Grace Foundation Cocktail Reception in Los Angeles last month

'I have already opened a savings account for their futures and my daughter's children will also have their own, with the same amount in. 

'They certainly do not lack funds but I will treat them equally.'

Prince Albert has two children from previous relationships - daughter Jazmin Grace Grimaldi, 22, and son Alexandre Coste, 10 - but neither are able to inherit the throne.

The princess recently spoke of her elation at the idea of becoming a mother. describing the experience as 'magical'.

She told French publication Paris Match, 'The prospect of the upcoming birth is so magical, so powerful. We are full of love, gratitude, as well as a great sense of responsibility. 

'I am particularly grateful for the spontaneous love bestowed on me in these special moments. The show of affection for my family, of the totality of the Monegasque people and all our friends.'

After and before: The princess  at seven months pregnant (left) and in April before announcing that she was expecting (right)

The royal couple announced they were expecting in May but the news that the former Olympic swimmer had twins on the way was unofficially broken on Twitter a week later by a friend of the princess's father.

South African TV presenter Derek Watts, a friend of Mike Wittstock, tweeted: 'My old Bulawayo schoolmate Mike Wittstock has phoned to say his daughter is pregnant with twins. Congrats Princess Charlene and Albert!'

The official announcement of the twins was only made last month, with the Palace releasing a statement that read: 

'The Prince and Princess of Monaco are happy to confirm they are expecting twins at the end of the year.' 

With an average of 3.5 sets of twins born per 1,000 pregnancies, an instant family of two babies - even royal ones - isn't unusual.

Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia is one royal parent of twins, who with wife Princess Sophie of Isenberg welcomed Carl Friedrich and Louis Ferdinand in 2013.

Another is Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark and his wife Mary, who became parents to Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine in 2011.

Prince Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou is yet another royal father of twins, following the birth of Prince Louis, Duke of Burgundy and Prince Alphonse, Duke of Berry, to his wife María Margarita Vargas Santaella in 2010.

But although royal twins are fairly frequent among European dynasties, among them the Monégasque couple, British royals are an entirely different story with just one set born in the last 2,000 years.

Born to King James I of Scotland and his wife Joan Beaufort in 1430, Alexander and James were the first and only twins born to British royal parents.

Tragically though, Alexander, the eldest of the two, died before reaching one - with his younger brother later taking the throne of Scotland as James II.

During his marriage to Mary of Guelders, James sired no fewer than seven children, all of them in separate pregnancies.

Despite the lack of British royal twins, odds have shortened on another double birth - for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - taking place.

While the Monégasque rules of succession are clear, the British rules aren't set in stone, although as the new baby - or babies - will be spares, the question of who inherits what is less vexed.

In theory, with Prince George already in the royal nursery, the new babies would come behind him with the elder becoming the spare while the younger would have no real role.

As for which parent is responsible for the Monégasque royal twins - or the British ones, should they come to pass, Consultant Gynaecologist Dr Andrew Paterson says both could be behind a multiple birth, although the mother is the more likely candidate.

‘Twins are not genetically based,' he explains. 'Monozygotic twins are more rare and when a single fertilised egg divides in two, creating identical twins.

‘Another way is when a mother release two eggs at ovulation and both are fertilised, creating non identical twins.

‘If either the mother or the father have twins in their family, the chances of them having twins is higher.’
