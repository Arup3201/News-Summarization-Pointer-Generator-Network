The Southwest United States was told to prepare for major flooding from Tropical Storm Odile beginning Wednesday a week after severe weather washed out a major interstate in Nevada.

Odile passed over the Baja California peninsula Monday, flooding roadways and destroying homes with 110 mile per hour gusts, before turning northeast.

Southwestern states were hit with flooding last week in the wake of Tropical Storm Norbert, as Phoenix experienced its wettest day on record with 3.29 inches of rainfall, Mashable reported.

This came in the middle of a long drought year for the region, and the dry weather could spell disaster with the onset of sudden rain as Odile passes into the United States. 

An update from NOAA's National Hurricane Center Wednesday morning reported that rainfall of three to six inches could be expected, with up to nine inches in certain areas.

AccuWeather meteorologist Ken Clark projected that 'there is the potential for devastating, catastrophic and historic flooding in this scenario.' 

 The National Weather Service put flash flood watches into effect for significant portions of Arizona and New Mexico and parts of Southern California, Nevada and West Texas.

'Travel on Interstate-10 between El Paso, Texas, and Phoenix will be dangerous,' Clark said.

Dry riverbeds also create conditions for flash floods to be increasingly dangerous.

Residents in the regions expected to be worst hit began preparing for high water.

'It flooded my whole property, my horse pens, and my garage was under about,' Roger Fuller told the Associated Press. 'This time around, we're trying to keep the water off the property.'

Odile's winds have calmed to 40 miles per hour, according to NOAA. The storm had sustained gusts of 110 miles per hour when it crashed through resort areas in Mexico's Baja California.

CBS reported that the windows at one hotel were shattered by the storm, forcing tourists to seek shelter in the basement.

Residents fared much worse, as many homes were completely destroyed.
