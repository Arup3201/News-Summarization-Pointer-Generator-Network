A big weekend of derbies in the Premier League sees Arsenal travel to Tottenham and Liverpool face Everton.

At Goodison Park, Liverpool will look to continue their impressive run of form, while the race for fourth hots up at White Hart Lane. 

To celebrate, Sportsmail's experts cast their minds back to decide the best derby matches they've ever seen...

Tottenham 0-5 Arsenal, December 1978 

As a fan I loved watching Arsenal beat Spurs 5-0 in 1978, with Liam Brady scoring that fabulous goal. He bent it in the corner and as a young kid that was a classic game. 

In terms of playing, the most memorable derby I played in was the FA Cup semi-final at Old Trafford in 2001. It was Sol Campbell’s last game for Tottenham before he moved to Arsenal and it was great to beat our old rivals.

Manchester United 4-3 Manchester City, September 2009

To borrow a line from my intro that night, until this remarkable game reached its extraordinary climax, a conversation between Michael Owen and Sir Alex Ferguson about derby winners would have been limited to events on Epsom Downs. 

Owen’s winner, scored in the sixth minute of second-half stoppage time after City had equalised three times, crowned what Sir Alex Ferguson considered the greatest Manchester derby in history.

Everton 2-3 Liverpool, April 2001 

Last season’s 3-3 draw at Goodison Park was possibly the best football match these two sides have produced in the last 20 years but it has to play second fiddle to the meeting in April 2001. 

Five goals, dreadful refereeing decisions for both sides, a missed penalty (Robbie Fowler), a scored penalty (David Unsworth), a red card (Igor Biscan) and settled in injury time - 3-2 in Liverpool’s favour - by Gary McAllister’s 40-yard free-kick. Astonishing.

Boca Juniors 0-3 River Plate, March 2002

An extraordinarily visceral derby, with Boca’s ground, the Bombonera, shaking as the teams came out. A 21-year-old Esteban Cambiasso opened the scoring for River with Eduardo Goudet and Ricardo Rojas securing the win. 

What was remarkable was that the entire stadium of Boca fans all sang continuously at deafening pitch for the final ten minutes of the game, expressing their undying love for the club despite the humiliation. Even Rojas’s 88th-minute goal had no impact on them.

Everton 3-3 Liverpool, November 2013 

Last season’s Merseyside derby at Goodison matched any classic from yesteryear. Everton and Liverpool were in the top five, bang in form, and reckless in their attacking ambition. 

The big names delivered - Luis Suarez, Romelu Lukaku (2), Daniel Sturridge, Kevin Mirallas and Philippe Coutinho all scored - and 3-3 was fair because nobody deserved to lose.

Sheffield Wednesday 2-1 Sheffield Utd, April 1993

Brilliant free-kick by Waddle in the opening minutes sparked a memorable match, a United fight back inspired by beardy warhorse and hero Alan Cork in extra time. 

It was also a fabulous spectacle created by fans from a city where football means so much but where glory days are few. With so much at stake the atmosphere was electric and it wasn’t even in Sheffield.

Manchester United 4-3 Manchester City, September 2009

Old Trafford, and the noisy neighbours were just beginning to annoy the residents of Stretford. This was a day that City would really test United’s mettle, refusing to lie down as, inspired by the remarkable Craig Bellamy, Mark Hughes’ team held his old club at 3-3 deep into added time.

United, though, really knew how to win back then and, with seconds remaining, Ryan Giggs played in Michael Owen at the Stretford End. In a flash, a remarkable game was won.

Everton 4-4 Liverpool, February 1991

I was at that FA Cup replay and it was the best live game I’ve ever watched. The atmosphere was unbelievable and it was a game that had everything – great drama and lots of goals including that incredible strike from John Barnes. 

From my playing days, it was Liverpool beating Everton 3-2 when Robbie Fowler sniffed the ground after scoring. You always remember the games you win.
