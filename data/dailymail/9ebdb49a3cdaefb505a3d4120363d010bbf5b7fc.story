David Cameron's children cheered him on today as he demolished Labour's newest election attack by vowing not to increase VAT after the general election.

At the final Prime Minister's Questions before Parliament is dissolved, Mr Cameron stunned Ed Miliband by immediately agreeing that the shopping levy will not rise under the Tory government. 

The Tory leader's wife Samantha and children Nancy and Elwen were in the public gallery cheering on what could be his final Commons appearance as Prime Minister.

They looked delighted as Mr Cameron tore into his opponent, branding him 'Alex Salmond's poodle' and mocking him over his fraught Labour leadership battle with David Miliband.

David Cameron today demolished Labour's newest election attack by vowing not to increase VAT after the general election

Delighted Tory MPs cheered Mr Cameron's final appearance at the Despatch Box before the general election on May 7

Labour yesterday unveiled a new poster warning of Tory VAT hikes after the election.  The headline rate of VAT stands at 20 per cent after George Osborne increased it from 17.5 per cent in his emergency Budget in 2010.

Labour yesterday vowed not to increase the duty, but Mr Osborne refused to follow suit.

Mr Miliband directly challenged the Prime Minister on the issue today, expecting the Tory to dodge the question.

But Mr Cameron hit back: 'Straight answers deserve straight questions and the answer's yes.'

He then challenged Labour to rule out an increase in National Insurance which Mr Miliband refused to commit to.

But hours after the leader's disastrous Commons outing, Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls announced he would commit in the election manifesto not to hike National Insurance.

With a major Labour attack shredded to raucous cheers from the Tory benches, Mr Miliband tried to salvage the situation by claiming: 'Nobody is going to believe him because of his extreme spending plans.'

In response the Prime Minister responded by repeatedly challenging Mr Miliband to rule out a rise in national insurance under a Labour government - which he declined to do. 

Mr Cameron declared: 'Straight answer from me, straight question to him - I have ruled out VAT, will he rule out national insurance contributions, yes or no?'

Mr Miliband sought to deflect the question, saying: 'He'll have plenty of time to ask questions after May 7.'

ON SNP'S ALEX SALMOND

'Alex Salmond has taken the entire Labour Party hostage and today we have got the ransom note. It says higher borrowing, uncontrolled immigration, unfettered welfare, higher taxes and weaker defence.'

ON BEING A LAME DUCK PM 

'I'll tell you what is a lame duck and that is trying to get into Downing Street on the back of Alex Salmond's coat-tails.'

ON ED MILIBAND 

'Never mind talk of ducks, I'm looking at Alex Salmond's poodle.'

ON RICHARD III AND LABOUR'S BORTHERS AT WAR

'The last time someone did in one of their relatives to get the top job and country ended in chaos.'

...AND ONE GAFFE

To Labour MP Michael Connarty: 'First of all can I pay tribute to the honourable gentleman who is standing down at the election.' 

Connarty: "I'm not!"

Mr Cameron went on: "Sorry, let me rephrase that. I've got to say. I want to defend the [briefing] team. This is my 146th appearance at the Despatch Box during Prime Minister's Questions and they normally get these things right.'

Mr Cameron boosted Tory morale with a a series of personal attacks on the Labour leader.

After being called a chicken for avoiding TV debates and a lame duck for announcing plans to quit by 2020, Mr Cameron shouted backed: 'Never mind talk of ducks I'm looking at Alex Salmond's poodle.'

Delighted Tory MPs started shouting out 'woof woof' as the 30-minute session came close to descending into farce.

Moments later he seized on the burial of Richard III this week to mock Mr Miliband for standing against his own brother for the Labour leadership.

'The last time someone did in one of their relatives to get the top job and country ended in chaos,' Mr Cameron said.

Mr Cameron arrived in the Commons on the back foot, after his surprise announcement that he would not seek a third term as Prime Minister if he is elected again this year. 

Mr Miliband sought to mock the PM, saying he was pleased he had 'announced his retirement plans'.

The Labour leader said: 'You said it was because you believed in giving straight answers to straight questions. After five years of Prime Minister's Questions, that was music to my ears.

'So here's a straight question: will you now rule out a rise in VAT?'

Mr Cameron shot back: 'In 43 days I plan to arrange your retirement.'

And  the astonishment of MPs on the Labour benches he categorically ruled out a VAT increase. He said: 'You are right, straight answers are deserved by straight questions. The answer is yes.' 

Labour MPs sat stony-faced as Tory MPs roared with laughter. Shouting over the noise, Mr Miliband ploughed on: 'Nobody is going to believe it. Nobody is going to believe it because of your extreme spending plans, because your numbers don't add up and because you promised it last time and you broke your promise.'

The noise eventually overwhelmed Mr Miliband and Commons Speaker John Bercow was forced to intervene and call for calm.

Mr Miliband then tried to challenge Mr Cameron on the claim that spending cuts in the next three years 'will be greater even than anything seen in the last five?'

But Mr Cameron insisted: 'You are wrong about that.' He then challenged Mr Miliband to answer a questions. 'Straight answer from me, straight question to you - I have ruled out VAT, will you rule out national insurance contributions? Yes or no?'

Mr Miliband said: 'You will have plenty of time to ask questions after May 7 and I'm afraid to say your own Office for Budget Responsibility says a much sharper squeeze on real spending than anything seen over the past five years.'
