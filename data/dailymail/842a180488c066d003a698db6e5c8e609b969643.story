A British company is developing self-healing fighter jets, transformers which split in the air when approaching the warzone and even 3D printers that could create drones while in the middle of a mission.

The science fiction technology is being researched by BAE systems who believe some of the ideas could be deployed by 2040.

Nick Colosimo, futurist with BAE's research and development department said the company wanted to show some of the ideas they were currently considering.

The Transformer aircraft is seen as massive advance in military technology as the jet divides into several parts performing different roles once reaching the objective

Once completed, the jets can reform creating a single aircraft for the return to their home airstrip

BAE Systems are developing Direct Energy weapon systems - more commonly known as lasers

The first idea involves on-board 3D printers which could create small drones which could be deployed during a mission.

The second involves an aircraft using nanotechnology which can repair battle-damage as soon as it happens.

A third type of aircraft uses 'transformer' technology allowing it to split into several different machines, each with a different role. 

The final technology involves directed energy systems - laser beams more familiar to fans of sci-fi films such as Star Wars or Star Trek.

The research is being conducted at BAE systems' research and development lab in Warton, Lancashire.

Mr Colosimo said: 'Of course we don't know exactly what sorts of aircraft technologies will be used in 2040 with any certainty, but it's great to be able to show the public some concepts that might be possible through projecting where today's technology could get to.

'BAE Systems has a rich heritage in research and development, and our team builds on literally decades of previous R&D work by thousands of scientists and engineers.'

The company has invested £117 million in research and development during 2013 alone.

BAE describes the 'Transformer' as 'a flexible aircraft system that combines smaller jets for more efficient travel, before having them split apart to quickly adapt to any scenario.'

An aircraft dubbed 'The Survivor'  uses nanotechnology to repair itself mid-air after suffered battle damage

According to BAE Systems, once the aircraft suffers battle damage, sensors determine exactly what is required to rectify the problem

By combining the jets on longer journey there could be potential gains to be made in terms of increased range and fuel savings by cutting the amount of drag, scientists claim.

Once they have reached their destination, the craft can then split off and used for a range of activities. These could include going on the offensive if threatened, being used for surveillance or dropping off supplies.

The Survivor is a lightweight adhesive fluid built inside the aircraft which allows jets to quickly heal themselves from damage sustained in flight. It is released to quickly 'set' in mid-flight and heal any damage.

This advanced use of materials would create a highly survivable jet capable of entering even the most dangerous of scenarios to complete vital missions, according to a BAE Systems spokesman.

BAE Systems sees the directed energy systems (DES) as an attachment weapon for aircraft that is capable of firing a concentrated beam of energy at the speed of light.

Modern-day battlefields feature DES, complete with concentrated energy beams, which can be used to protect ground troops from incoming missiles or mortars.

In the future this capability could be taken in to the air as an attachment for aircraft, allowing fast-moving jets to accurately destroy targets mid-air, the experts claim.

The team works with the UK's leading aviation thinkers from universities, government and a range of companies to predict and explore how aircraft engineering might evolve.
