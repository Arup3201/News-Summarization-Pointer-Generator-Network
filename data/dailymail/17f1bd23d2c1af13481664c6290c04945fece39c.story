The BBC is back in full force with Gareth Bale to return for Real Madrid against Rayo Vallecano on Saturday and reconvene a lethal trio with Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo.

Marca is expecting ‘Total attack’ from Real, who accounted for Liverpool 1-0 mid-week in the absence of the Welsh winger, against what the paper says is the ‘bravest team’ in La Liga.

The visitor’s boss Paco Jemez, not surprisingly, rates the league leaders highly.

'Total attack' expected from Real Madrid against Rayo Vallecano , says Marca, while AS hails the return of the BBC (Karim Benzema, Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo

The AS play it straight with ‘The BBC is back’ and muses about who will make way for Bale as the midfield is forced to reshuffle. They have Real boss Carlo Ancelotti saying “I’m thinking of playing Isco further back.”

Meanwhile, AS says Barcelona are ‘At risk in Almeria’, also on Saturday, with Luis Enrique’s side facing a possible third consecutive defeat in the league after losses to Real and Celta Vigo. Barca are in fifth but just two points behind Real on top.

Mundo Deportivo says goals from their front three Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez are the key for Barca, in p[articular the Uruguayan who’s yet to impress for his new club.

‘The Golden Boot must start scoring to avoid any alarms and recover his self-confidence,’ they write.
