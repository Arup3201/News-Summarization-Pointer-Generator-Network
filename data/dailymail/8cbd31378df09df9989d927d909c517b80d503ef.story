A luminescent orb of lightning speeds its way down a power line in Lachine, Quebec

Huw Griffiths captured the terrifying moment his home was nearly hit by a fireball in Lachine, Montreal, on Friday.

Around 350,000 Hydro-Quebec customers lost power in total and 80,000 were still without power by 7pm on Friday.

Patrice Lavoie, a spokesperson for Hydro-Quebec, told Global news that, ‘There’s only so much we can do when we have to fight against the elements. ‘

Recovery teams must wait until the storm is over before they can go back into the area.

‘What gave the severe winds, the 
damaging winds, was the rapidly rising pressure behind this intense 
weather system front,’ said meteorologist Michael Elliot.

Hyrdo-Quebec’s Twitter page has been announcing updates on the storm.

‘In
those cases, our teams have to go over there, remove branches from the 
network, in some cases, we have also trees that have fallen on the 
networks,’ said Lavoie.

Ball lightning has been seen to float across land or through buildings and can even bounce down the aisles of aircraft.

But its rarity has made it extremely hard to study and to understand.

Eye-witness reports of ball lightning vary wildly in the size of the ball, how long it lasts, and how it moves.

'We heard a snap and a large bang and we were without power and then we found out that there was a tree that had fallen down in the park next to us,” said one Montrealer to Global news.

Hydro-Quebec said, ‘Unfortunately, in some areas where the system is damaged, the outages might last longer.’

Hydro-Quebec warns people to never approach power lines and to assume that they are charged.
