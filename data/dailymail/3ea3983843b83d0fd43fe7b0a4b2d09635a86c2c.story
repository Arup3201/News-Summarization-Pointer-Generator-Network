President Barack Obama was warned by intelligence officials about the threat presented by the Islamic State at least a year before it began its murderous rampage across Iraq, a news report revealed on Tuesday.

A Pentagon official familiar with the President's Daily Brief told Fox News that anyone at the White House who read the report 'could not come away with any other impression: This is getting bad.'

The Pentagon official's claims are consistent with those of other sources in the intelligence community and regional experts who have said it's improbable that the president was caught off guard by the rise of the Islamic extremist group.

President Barack Obama reportedly ignored briefings for at least a year before ISIS struck in Iraq warning him about the danger the group posed to the country

'It could have been a surprise for the average citizen. But I do not 
believe to the United States government it was a surprise, Tariq 
al-Hashimi, an exiled Iraqi vice president, told the Daily Beast in early July.

'Everything is monitored, you can always see where ISIS is, it’s easy to
 trace them. I just don’t believe they were caught by surprise.'

The official who spoke to Fox News described the briefings President Obama received as 'granular' in detail and the information provided as it pertains to Syria was 'exquisite.'

'[We] were ready to fire, on a moment's notice, on a couple hundred 
targets,' the source told Fox. Some targets were even in their sights for a 'long period of time.'

But the president chose not to act, the source said. Nor did he request additional information on activities of ISIS including in his daily briefing.

Speaking to John Catsimatidis during his The Cats Roundtable radio show, former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney latched on to Fox's report and said that the violence in Iraq could have been avoided if Obama had acted a year ago when he was told there 'was 
significant chance that [Islamic extremists] would go into Iraq and invade a city 
there.'

'Those mistakes were made and now we have
 ISIS,' Romney said, according to the Christian Post.

'The president failed to take action. He watched. 
We saw ISIS roll into Iraq. Instead of attacking them immediately and 
not knocking them in their convoy, when it would have been easy to knock
 down, the president again watched,' he continued.

'Now we are in a position where ISIS 
has run throughout major portions of Iraq. There have been horrific 
human rights abuses, tragedies including those upon American 
journalists. Now we are in a difficult position.'

An intelligence official told the Daily Beast in July that while the fall of the second largest city in Iraq was surprising, analysts had been telling the White House since the beginning of 2013 about 'growing problems and deficiencies within the Iraqi Security Forces.'

Among their concerns were 'leadership 
shortfalls' and a 'steady degradation in capabilities that was making it
 difficult for Iraqi Security Forces to combat ISIS.'

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest denied on Tuesday that President Obama was aware of intelligence forewarning him about ISIS longer than he's let on.

''I’m not sure when the President would have suggested that,' Earnest said.

'I’m not in a position to give out details of the President’s Daily Briefing,' he added. 'But I can tell you that for years the President and other members of his national security team have expressed our concern about extremist elements in Syria and the impact -- the destabilizing impact they could have on the broader region.'

The Pentagon official who spoke with Fox also says that the White House waited longer than it could have to embark on a rescue mission to save American journalist James Foley from being slaughtered at the hands of ISIS.

Fox says its source in the Pentagon claims the Commander in Chief was informed that a 'large, heavily armed compound, believed to be housing Foley, and other 
potential captives, was identified near the ISIS stronghold of Raqaa, 
Syria.'

But the White House opted not to strike, the source said, because it was waiting for the 'intelligence to build up more.
