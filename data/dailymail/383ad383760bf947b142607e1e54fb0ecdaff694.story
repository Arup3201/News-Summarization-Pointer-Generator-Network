If the thought of walking along the edge of skyscrapers completely unprotected turns you queasy, it's probably best you look away now.

Daring photographer Tom Ryaboi snaps the Toronto skyline from the top of skyscrapers as a pioneer of the heart-stopping photography movement rooftopping.

To achieve these breathtaking photographs, he often has to evade security guards, dogs - and even urban falcons defending their nests.

Walking freely along the edge of skyscrapers, knowing full well that one slip would mean game over is part of the attraction for rooftoppers. This particular rooftopper has the audacity to do it in a clown's mask

The 28-year-old, from Toronto in Canada,
 has climbed more than 100 buildings and produced some of the most 
stunning examples of the craze.

Previouslty, when asked why Mr Ryaboi got into rooftopping, he said: 'It's addictive and I am 
always looking for a higher roof in the city. But I still feel the buzz 
whenever I reach the top and feel the wind. It's a pure rush of 
adrenaline.'

Disguising themselves so they can 
carry out their daring stunts, the thrill seekers avoid security and 
CCTV before climbing to the top of skyscrapers and hanging off
 the edge - photographing the evidence as proof of their antics.

He added: 'I
 try to blend in as much as possible. In an office building I
 dress like I work there, on a construction site I dress like the 
workmen.

'It's in my blood. When I was a child one day, my dad came home from work and found me sitting on top of the fridge.

'They had no idea how I had got there, but obviously I just liked climbing things.'

Rooftoppers often disguise themselves to get past security and to the top of buildings in order to capture the shot they want
