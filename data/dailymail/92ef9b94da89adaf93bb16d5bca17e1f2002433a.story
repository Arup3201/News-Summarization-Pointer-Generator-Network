David Cameron broke off his holiday for a crisis meeting with security chiefs yesterday following the beheading of a US journalist by a British jihadi.

He travelled back from Cornwall to co-ordinate the hunt for the Islamic State fanatic who murdered James Foley.

In a statement last night he said it appeared ‘increasingly likely’ that the ‘deeply shocking’ killing had been carried out by a British citizen. Mr Cameron watched the appalling video of the murder himself ‘to inform his understanding of the type of threat we face’.

The Prime Minister was then briefed by security and intelligence chiefs on the hunt to identify the fanatic in the video, who appeared to speak with a London accent.

Sources said every effort was being made to identify the killer – but stressed that finding and apprehending him in a war zone was a major task.

Number Ten would not say when the Prime Minister would resume his holiday, which is his second break of the summer. They had announced that he was returning from his Cornish trip just 90 minutes after Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he was not coming back.

At 8.30am, Mr Hammond said Mr Cameron was ‘entitled to a break’, and, in any case, remained fully briefed on developments. ‘The Prime Minister is only a couple of hundred miles down the road,’ he told the programme. ‘He is in constant contact with ministers and officials throughout the day.

‘It is no different to him being in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland on a visit.’

Mr Cameron stayed in Downing Street last night, but could return to Cornwall as early as this evening. Sources said a recall of Parliament was ‘not on the cards’, despite growing clamour from MPs on all sides. The Prime Minister yesterday said he did not want a ‘knee-jerk’ response to the crisis but said ministers would ‘always look at new proposals for even tougher laws to deal with terrorism and extremism’.

Downing Street said he was focused on countering the threat posed by Islamic State fanatics in the Middle East – and by the risks posed by returning fighters. At least 500 British jihadis are thought to be fighting in Syria and Iraq.

A further 250 are thought to have already returned to the UK where the police and security services are attempting to monitor them.

A recall of Parliament, however, is still not being considered

The Government yesterday said that 23 people have had their passports confiscated this year to prevent them travelling to the war zone. Seven people with dual nationality have been stripped of their British citizenship while abroad. There have also been 69 arrests in this country relating to activities in Syria and Iraq.

Mr Cameron yesterday issued ‘refreshed guidance’ to police to clamp down on those fomenting support for Islamic State in this country. Number Ten said police had been reminded they had the powers to arrest anyone distributing leaflets or flying terrorist flags.

Earlier, Mr Hammond said British troops could be sent to Baghdad within weeks to help train forces to fight against the extremists who have cut a swathe across northern Iraq.

He also suggested British jets could play a greater reconnaissance role in Iraq and that the UK could help arm the Kurds, as Germany yesterday agreed to do. He said Islamic State was ‘waging war against the West, and we have to deal with them on that basis’.

Mr Hammond acknowledged that Britain now had in Islamic State a ‘common enemy’ with the Syrian regime, but played down the prospects of forming an alliance with tyrant Bashar al-Assad.

Former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell said Parliament should have been recalled ‘weeks ago’, given the seriousness of events. Tory MP Colonel Bob Stewart said: ‘If we are talking about putting military forces on the ground in Iraq, even for training purposes, then I don’t think there is any choice but to recall Parliament.’

Former Labour minister Gisela Stuart, a member of the Commons defence committee, suggested that the reluctance to recall Parliament suggested Mr Cameron does not yet have a coherent strategy. Miss Stuart said: ‘All we have heard is increasingly big words and rhetoric with nothing underpinning them.’

Tory MP Conor Burns also stepped up his demand for a recall, saying: ‘It is incredible that we have got to the point where the Pope is virtually calling for air strikes but we are still opposed to carrying them out.’

Mr Cameron yesterday insisted Britain ‘is not going to get involved in another Iraq war’, adding: ‘We’re not putting combat troops, combat boots, on the ground.’

He added: ‘We will stick to the very clear foreign policy and the very clear strategy that we have which is to work with the new Iraqi government, to help make sure the Kurds get the arms they need to fight off these brutal extremists, to work with our allies.’
