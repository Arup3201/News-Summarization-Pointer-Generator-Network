A criminal gang tricked Loose Women presenter Andrea McLean into taking part in a low-budget film to avoid having to pay tax.

The Loose Women presenter can be seen getting intimate with a man and then another woman in the movie which was a cover-up for the scam.

The criminals claimed they were making a £20m gangster film called A Landscape Of Lies so they could claim £1million in tax credits and VAT repayments.

Ms McLean was unwittingly roped into starring in the fake thriller, and was given the role of bisexual therapist called Dr Audrey Grey

As well as McLean, Marc Bannerman from EastEnders was also approached to take part in the video

When HMRC became suspicious former property developer Bassar Al-Issa, 33, 
film producer Aoife Madden, 31, Tariq Hassan, 51, Ian Sherwood, 53, and
Osama Al-Baghdady, 50, cobbled together a script and cast to try and 
convince investigators the project was real.

To
give it credibility, Ms McLean was unwittingly roped into starring in 
the fake thriller, and was given the role of bisexual therapist called 
Dr Audrey Grey.

Former EastEnders actor Marc Bannerman, who played Gianni di Marco in the BBC soap, was also approached.

At
least ten versions of a the script were drafted, pre-production work 
was done to try to con HMRC investigators but it failed, Southwark Crown
Court was told.

'The 
documents were mere window dressing, they were produced to fool HMRC and
the accountants who acted on their behalf to claim film credits that 
there was a film being made', said prosecutor Shane Collery.

'It
was a fiction, they were intended to deceive. The work had not been 
carried out to anything like the level set out in the invoices.'

The Landscape Of Lies website boasts:
'This gritty British drama is a complex exploration of lives that will 
draw you into their seedy world of power, lies, and betrayal. 

'The
dark themes are subtly illuminated by the characters' poignant stories,
The storyline challenges peoples notions of what's right and what's 
wrong.'

Al-Issa was found guilty of two counts of conspiracy to cheat the public revenue.

Hassan,
Al-Baghdady and Sherwood were each found guilty of a single count of 
conspiracy to cheat the public revenue but cleared of a second 
conspiracy charge.

Madden, born in Newry, Northern Ireland, earlier admitted the two conspiracy charges.

Al-Issa,
a bankrupt former construction company boss from Iraq, dreamt up the 
scheme while studying at the University of East London.

He
set up the fake companies along with finances lecturer at the 
University, Hassan, architect Sherwood and Jordanian businessman 
Al-Baghdady.

The gang, who had no experience in the
film industry, convinced HMRC that Madden's production company Evolved 
Pictures had secured £19.6million in financial backing from a Jordanian 
company.

They made a 
series of payments between their own companies to use as evidence for 
fraudulent tax credit claims, between April 2010 and April 2011.

They
raked in £1million before suspicions were raised and the film featuring
Ms McLean and Mr Bannerman had to be shot to try to cover their tracks.

A spokesman for Ms McLean declined to comment on the court case today.

'The
impetus for making this film was likely to be because these defendants 
had been arrested in April 2011 and they needed to show they were going 
to make something, but it was a very different film from that presented 
to gain government funds', said Mr Collery.

Scam: Producer Aoife Madden formed the final part of the group, who also convinced former EastEnders star Marc Bannerman to take part - although he believed it was a real project

'A series of companies were set up and three companies in particular became involved as producers of the film.

'They were not at arms length, they had various links between them. They were made to create a chain of companies so the VAT they were claiming could be reclaimed.

'The whole purpose was to steal money from the public purse.'

The Evolved firm subcontracted work to another company called AB Production Limited, being run by Albaghdady, who in turn passed work on to a third company called A-Z Consortium Unlimited.

A-Z appeared to be run by a Jordanian man, but in fact turned to be under the control of Al-Issa, with Hassan acting as bookkeeper.
