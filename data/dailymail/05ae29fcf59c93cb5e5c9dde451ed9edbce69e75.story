Students at Reynolds High, Oregon, held a sombre graduation ceremony yesterday just two days after a shooting at the school.

On Tuesday, Jared Padgett, 15, shot and killed fellow student Emilio Hoffman, 14, before turning the gun on himself.

Last night Emilio's brother, Joshua Mitchell, donned his younger sibling's soccer jersey over the top of his graduation robes in a touching tribute.

There was also a round of applause for Todd Rispler, the school gym teacher who was grazed by gunfire but 
fought to initiate the school lockdown, which police said likely saved 
lives.

Tuesday's shooting, the third outburst of gun violence to shake a U.S. high school or college campus in less than three weeks, unfolded on what was supposed to be the second-to-last day of classes at Reynolds High School in Troutdale.

Instead, school officials canceled the last day of classes on Wednesday, along with final exams, and arranged for grief counselors to be made available for students.

The 
disruption continued at a senior class commencement ceremony on Thursday
 evening, with nearly 500 students, as well as parents and teachers 
battling mixed emotions: the joy of graduation and the lasting mark of 
tragedy.

The
 crowd observed a moment of silence in memory of Emilio who was killed 
when Padgett walked into the boys' locker room and opened fire with a 
AR-15 assault-style rifle.

Todd Rispler, a gym teacher, battled to get the school into lockdown despite being wounded by Padgett, and was praised by police for saving lives

'It's very important that you as graduates realize that this is your night. I also hope that you remember the one, who like you, will never walk the halls of Reynolds High School again, but for a different reason,' Principal Wade Bakley said in an address after the moment of silence.

'Celebrate loud so everyone can hear you, including Emilio,' he said.

Student 
Cole Bronson, wearing his cap and gown, looked for a way forward in 
brief remarks to reporters assembled outside the arena.

'We are down, not out,' he said. 'Tonight is our night, class of 2014.'

On Twitter, users messaged their support for students. Isaiah Lozano said: 'Good graduation for Reynolds tonight. RIP Emilio Hoffman. Great seeing how strong his brother was tonight graduating.'

Angel Phan added: 'Tonight was such a beautiful graduation for Reynolds C/O 2014 #staystrong.'

However there was some shock that the graduation still went ahead. Michelle Lynn said: 'I have to be honest, I'm surprised Reynolds still had graduation. It's a nice surprise, but it's still a surprise.'
