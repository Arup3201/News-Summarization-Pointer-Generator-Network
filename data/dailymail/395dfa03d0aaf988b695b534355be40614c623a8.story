A star's twinkling could help uncover the sizes and gravity of the hundreds of exoplanets.

A team of astronomers at the Vanderbilt University in Nashville have said the flickering can give up a host of secrets of its orbiting planets.

Hundreds of ‘exoplanets’ outside our solar system have been identified in the last 20 years but estimates of their size could be 200 per cent out.

The team at Vanderbilt however has now developed a new technique of studying the star's flickering to calculate its surface gravity which could cut the previous uncertainties in half - and show if they could be rocky like Earth or gaseous and uninhabitable like Jupiter.

Professor Keivan Stassun, who led the team of astronomers, said: 'Once you know a star’s surface gravity then you only need one other measurement, its temperature, which is pretty easy to obtain, to determine its mass, size and other important physical properties.'

Researchers showed variations on a timescale of hours in a star’s brightness are associated with its surface gravity.

The findings published in Nature are based on observations by the Kepler Space Telescope and offer a simple new way of determining a basic stellar property that has previously been difficult to measure accurately.

Optical brightness variations allow a calculation of the surface gravity of Sun-like stars with a precision of better than 25 per cent - a dramatic improvement on other techniques.

Brightness variations of Sun-like stars are driven by many factors including granulation - the network of small cells that cover the surface of a star that are caused by columns of gas rising from the interior.

On stars with high surface gravity, the granulation is finer and flickers at a higher frequency. On stars with low surface gravity, the granulation is coarser and they flicker at a lower frequency.

Rising hot gases and descending cool gas create hot and cold patches that flicker - twinkling light that is detected by Kepler.

Scientists can turn the light into ‘sound’, with almost no ‘hiss’ denoting a small ‘dwarf’ star.Lots of hiss meanwhile would indicate a huge 'red giant'.

Professor Gibor Basri, of California University in Berkeley, said: 'Measuring stellar surface gravities well has always been a difficult business.

'So it’s is a very pleasant surprise to find the subtle flickering of a star’s light provides a relatively easy way to do it.'

Maria Womack, the program director at the National Science Foundation in the US which funded the research, said: 'This actually could be the breakthrough we’ve needed to pin down the sizes of hundreds more stars and exoplanets.

'Getting accurate sizes is critical to measuring exoplanet density which has been a missing puzzle piece for so many planets.

'So - in addition to having implications for stellar evolution - this innovative work will be invaluable for identifying hundreds of exoplanets as either rocky or gaseous.'

Prof Jorgen Christensen-Dalsgaard, of Aarhus University in Denmark, reviewed the study for the journal and described it as 'highly satisfying' given the wording of the old nursery rhyme.

He said: 'Studying the twinkling of stars does indeed help us to understand what they are.'
