A 13-year-old boy was found in Montana Sunday night 700 miles from where he went missing five days earlier, but it's still unclear he got there.

Oregon resident Jonathan Marshall King was located in Great Falls, Mont., after his family reported him as a runaway on June 11, the Gresham Police Department said in a statement. 

'I'm happy, I'm so happy he's okay. I was so worried about him,' Jonathan's mother, Cherry King, told KATU News after hearing he was found. 'We haven't talked to him yet. They put him in holding so they can make sure he stays where he's at until we come and get him.'

As of Sunday night, local police said there are no details on how the boy managed to get to Great Falls from his hometown in Gresham, which is over 700 miles away and over an 11-hour car trip.

Jonathan apparently hitchhiked to Montana to be with his 14-year-old sister, who was staying in Great Falls with a cousin, KATU News reported. Though she didn't know he was coming, Jonathan told his sister he had plans to run away.

'A couple of weeks ago, he told his sister that he wanted to run away downtown, but he was having some problems and he'd been meeting with the bishop and he felt better,' his mother told KPTV.

Great Falls police called local police in Gresham at 7 p.m. Sunday night to report the boy had been found.

The Kings first reported Jonathan as a runaway to police the previous Tuesday when they got a call from officials at Gordon Russell Middle School saying he hadn't shown up for class.

Before going missing, Jonathan's parents last saw him when he left home at 8:45 a.m. and began the one mile walk to school.

Help: Before he was found, Jonathan Marshall King's family distributed fliers around Gresham, Ore.

'Somethings not right. He's always on time,' Jonathan's father Jason King told KATU before he was found Sunday. 'He's always been on time.'

Jonathan's parents distributed hundreds of fliers and spoke to his friends in the days he was missing.

'I'm scared. I'm scared that something happened to him,' his mother told KATU.

At first, they believed he had runaway, but after several days with no news, Jonathan's parents questioned their rush to judgement.

'We realized we probably made a mistake. We went through his clothes and realized none of them were missing,' his mother said.

Plea: Before he was found, Jonathan Marshall King's mother, Cherry King, asked her son to come home. 'If we did anything to make you mad we're sorry,' she told KATU

Police also believed Jonathan ran away at first because some items were missing from his room, according to The Oregonian—though he didn't have a history of this type of behavior.

His father thought the worst. 

'I'm worried he tried talking to somebody or somebody had seen him on the way to school and coerced him to a car or vehicle or something,' he told KATU.

Jonathan's mother pleaded to her son to KATU the day before he was found safe.

'Please come home and if we did anything to make you mad we're sorry,' she said Saturday, crying. 'We don't want you to get hurt.'
