One person is dead and another 19 are injured after a stolen car going the wrong way on an Indiana highway slammed head-on into a Greyhound Bus, authorities said.

Phillip Lloyd died after the 1999 Ford Mustang he was driving rammed the New York-bound bus Sunday morning about 35 miles west of Dayton, Ohio.

The 7.00 a.m. crash occurred just before the bus, which originated in St. Louis, Missouri, was scheduled to make a stop in Dayton, officials told WRTV.

'It had been reported stolen from the Love's truck stop... just prior to the crash,' Sheriff Jeff Cappa said of the sports car.

Images from the scene show the bus off the side of Interstate 70 with significant damage to its front end. The Mustang is unrecognizable.

Authorities have not said how fast the vehicle was traveling when it hit the bus. They also have declined to release the car thief's age.

'I've seen a lot of accidents, and I've never seen anything like this,' said witness Brandi Schroeder.

Reid Memorial Hospital spokesman Larry Price says about half of those treated at the Richmond hospital after the Sunday morning crash have already been released.

He says many of the passengers had scrapes, cuts and bruises.

The driver was airlifted to Methodist Hospital, about 70 miles west in Indianapolis, WXIN reported. His condition is not known.

Wayne County spokesman Jonathan Duke said earlier Sunday that 18 people were transported by ground or air to hospitals and one person was reportedly killed. It wasn't clear if any of the injured were taken to other hospitals for treatment.

The bus was carrying a total of 24 passengers and the driver, a Greyhound spokesperson told WTHR.

Additional buses were sent to local hospitals to round up the discharged passengers.

A MailOnline attempt to reach A Greyhound spokesperson for further details about when the passengers would be able to continue on to New York was not successful.
