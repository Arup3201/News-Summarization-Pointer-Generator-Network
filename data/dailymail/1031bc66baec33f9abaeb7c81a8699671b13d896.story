A Florida police officer is on paid leave and facing an internal affairs investigation after a video captured him shooting a 62-year-old woman in the back with a stun gun Tuesday.

Viola Young approached officers shortly after they had taken three individuals into custody on a narrow Tallahassee street close to the governor's mansion.

She can be heard on a video apparently shot with a cellphone from a neighbor's porch shouting 'I have some some questions.'

Tased: Viola Young, 62, was hit in the back with a stun gun after Officer Terry Mahan ordered her to back away and tried to grab her arm

The officer by the vehicle closest to Young tells her to stay back as Officer Terry Mahan walks from the other end of the street. He reaches out to grab her arm but Young twists away from him.

As she looks to be walking away, Mahan raises his stun gun and fires into Young's back, causing the woman to fall face first into the road.

Tallahassee Police Chief Michael DeLeo announced at a late-night press conference after the department had obtained and reviewed the video. 

'Based on the video, I have enough concerns to call for an internal investigation,' DeLeo said. 'We will conduct a thorough investigation into this incident. We want to be transparent with the community by sharing what we can at this point, including the video.'

Voices in the video can be heard advising Young not to approach officers and after she falls to the ground, the person with the cellphone says police 'tased a lady for nothing.'

Young was handcuffed on the ground as officers walked over to Young to help her up and escort her to a squad car.

According to police, Young was medically cleared by paramedics and charged with resisting and obstructing an officer without violence.

The first-degree misdemeanor carries a sentence of up to 12 months in jail or a fine of up to $1000.

Young told the Associated Press her attorney instructed her not to speak about the incident.

The Tallahassee Democrat reports Chuck Hobbs, a Tallahassee attorney, wrote a letter to State Attorney Willie Meggs asking him to 'strongly consider' charges against Mahan.

'I am asking you to strongly consider filing charges directly,' the letter stated, 'if you and your top investigators conclude that this incident was unjustified.' 

Tallahassee police have been scrutinized in recent months. In September, the city settled for $475,000 in a case where a woman had her nose broken following an arrest and an altercation with officers.

The arrest of Christina West last year was also filmed, showing officers throwing her against a police car and then onto the ground as West screams.

West can be heard screaming in the video. A grand jury declined to press charges against officers.
