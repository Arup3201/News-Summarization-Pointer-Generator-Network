Former GOP presidential hopeful Herman Cain has been given his own morning radio show.

Conservative talk radio host Neal Boortz announced his retirement today after four decades at the microphone, saying he will be replaced by Cain.

The 66-year-old Atlanta businessman 
and former WSB radio show host, dropped out of the presidential race in 
December amid allegations of sexual improprieties, which he denied.

He 
will take over Boortz' time slot and be distributed to the same radio 
stations.

Boortz said during his morning talk show that his last day will be January 21, 2013, the day of the presidential inauguration.

Boortz , 67, said he is in good health and plans to enjoy retirement by traveling with his wife.

He said: 'This has been a stress-free job for me. It's just been a total and absolutely joy. I'm going to miss everything associated with doing a talk radio show.'

Boortz's show is syndicated across the country through Atlanta's WSB radio, drawing six million listeners on 230 radio stations.

Cain appeared on the show today. He said 'We tell people the cold, hard truth and the facts.

'I want to continue to express my views and help educate people about what's going on in this country. It's like you say: the dumb masses are ruining this country.'

The more toppings a man has on his pizza, I believe the more manly he is…. Because the more manly man is not afraid of abundance.... A manly man don't want it piled high with vegetables! He would call that a sissy pizza.

When they ask me who’s the president of Ubeki-beki-beki-beki-stan-stan 
I’m going to say, ‘You know, I don’t know. Do you know? And then I’m 
going to say, ‘how’s that going to create one job?’

You're a commonsense guy. You genuinely believe that millions of Americans wake up in their late teens normally and go, you know what, I kind of fancy being a homosexual? You don't believe that, do you?                     With Piers Morgan, October 2011

Cain is the former CEO of Godfather's Pizza. Since dropping out of the GOP race, he has provided daily commentary on Boortz's show and filled in when the host went on vacation.

As a candidate, Cain was best known for his 9-9-9 tax plan to overhaul the U.S. tax code.

The plan would have set income, corporate and sales taxes at 9 per cent each.

Boortz said he will do daily commentary for Cain's show and will help out when the former politician takes a break.

'I couldn't be happier. It's going to be great,' Boortz said. 'I'm really looking forward to saying to Donna, 'Where do you want to go now?'"

Cain became infamous on the campaign trail for his gaffes. In April he appeared on the Daily Show to deliver an 
Independence Day-style presidential speech and imagine he was standing 
on the wreckage of the Oval Office after an attack by 
extra-terrestrials.

'Citizens of Earth,' he began.'It was the spirit of humanity that built this planet.

'It
is that same spirit of humanity that will allow us to defend ourselves 
against unknown enemies. It is that same spirit of humanity that will 
allow us to destroy the aliens.'

He also returned to the issue of Uzbekistan, or 'U-beki-beki-beki-beki-stan-stan,' as he famously said in an interview.

High hopes: Cain dropped out of the GOP presidential race early after his campaign was marred with allegations of affairs

Cain claimed just because he didn't know the name of the country's president, doesn't mean he wasn't fit to be U.S. President.

'There is no way you can know the head of state for all of the nearly 200 nations on the planet,' Cain defended himself on the show.

Host John Oliver asked: 'I hope you don't disappoint. Who is the president of Uzbekistan?'

He answered: ''I did go and look it up and at one point, I did know his name. But since it's not something that I use everyday, it's gone again.'
