The widow of a British gemstone expert has spoken of her agony after her 71-year-old husband was stabbed to death by a hired mob armed with clubs, spears and bows and arrows in Kenya.

Judith Bridges’ husband Campbell Bridges was attacked by a horde of up to 30 armed assassins in a dispute over mining territory at his ranch near the town of Voi, 170km (110 miles) north of the Kenyan port city of Mombasa.

He was knifed in the chest by the mercenary thugs on a dirt road in front of his son Bruce, who took a blow to the neck from a machete as he fought desperately to protect his 71-year-old father.

After a five-and-half year battle for justice, hampered by the same politicians the Bridges family accuses of involvement in Campbell’s killing, four of the gang were on Friday each sentenced to 40 years in prison for Campbell’s murder on August 11, 2009. 

The family say they were put up to it by local politicians keen to muscle-in on Campbell's lucrative mining operations First Green Garnet Mining Company and Bridges Exploration Limited.

These figures resented the success of a ‘muzungu’, or white man, even though he was known for treating his workers well.

In the lead-up to the attack jealous 'claim-jumpers' had been digging illegal trenches on Campbell's land, looking to mine the gems for themselves.

On the day itself father and son were travelling in a pick-up truck along with four guards when they were ambushed by a heavily-armed posse in the grounds of Campbell's 600-acre ranch. 

Brandishing sticks, spears and machetes, the mob set upon Campbell, who managed to dodge a blow from a spear but was then stabbed by another knife-wielding attacker.

The first thug with the spear was about to try and stab Campbell again but Bruce hit him with a club.

Bruce then parried a blow from another man armed with a machete but sustained a gash to the neck.

Finally the killers ran off but it was too late for Campbell, who lay dying from a gaping wound in his chest. 

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, Judith broke down as she wrestled with her still raw anguish at the brutal loss of the man to whom she was married for nearly 40 years.

Speaking from Kenya, where she still lives for half of the year, the grandmother-of-two said: ‘When I remember him it’s hard, the pain never goes away. It’s very lonely.

‘I miss his curiosity, his enthusiasm and his creativity.

‘He wrote music, he wrote lyrics or he could write a lovely article for a magazine.

‘He always saw something beautiful in nature and everywhere he went he could find something positive.’

Campbell was born in London to a Scottish mother and an English father, who was chief geologist for the Central Mining and Investment Corporation in South Africa.

This lifelong connection to the continent deepened when Campbell went to study at Witwatersrand University in Johannesburg before going to work in Tanganyika's gemstone mines. 

His case has sparked fears for other legitimate foreign business-owners in Kenya at a lack of protection from police and local authorities when corrupt politicians go after their interests.

Though they denied murdering Mr Bridges Mohamed Dadi Kokone 42, Alfred Makoko Njuruka 58, Samwel Machala 49 and James Chacha 56, were sentenced to a total of 160 years in prison on Friday.

Judith said: ‘If it sends a message to the people in the country and the cartels that bully and intimidate and kill people that have legitimate businesses because they want to take them, my husband would have been pleased.

‘There has to be accountability in any society otherwise the gangsters are going to run it.

‘That is one thing Kenya is struggling with, to bring people to book and making it stick.

‘Otherwise the people who are creating things and doing things to build society like my husband are annihilated.’

Campbell was well-known in geological circles for discovering the green Tsavorite gemstone in 1967 in bushland on the Kenyan border with Tanzania.
