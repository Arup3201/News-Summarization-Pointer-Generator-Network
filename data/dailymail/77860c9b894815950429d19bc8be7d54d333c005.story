The Jane Fonda Foundation did not make
a single charitable donation in the five years for which it has filed 
federal tax returns, even though the organization was valued at nearly 
$800,000.

According to the 
foundation’s 2011 tax return, the organization’s assets were valued at 
$798,133, but had not made any contributions since 2006.

Barry Hirsch, Ms Fonda's attorney told MailOnline that the two-time Oscar winner had omitted to make charitable contributions in 2011.

However, he explained her Foundation had since made up for it with a larger donation made at the start of 2013 to make up for the missed payments.

Furthermore, Mr Hirsch said that Ms. Fonda had complied with all of the ethical and legal codes set by the IRS.

The group made a single $1,000 donation in 2006 to the Atlanta Obstetric and Gynecology Society according to The Smoking Gun.

The foundation also invested in the stock market with 166 different trades, which netted about $2,200, the report said.

Private
foundations must make distributions totaling at least 5 percent of 
their assets each year, which means the organization should have 
contributed a minimum of about $40,000 in 2011.

According to the IRS's own rules, a private charitable foundation has to donate at least five percent of its assets, or face stiff financial penalties.

It's designed to stop people from misusing charitable foundations as a tax dodge and a parking place for tax free income.

Ms Fonda's attourney explained how the Foundation had overpaid its contributions in 2004 meaning there was nothing to pay until the 2010/11 tax year.

The Fonda Foundation’s returns show that most of its assets were provided years ago by the performer herself with more than $320,000 coming from a Connecticut firm that has booked speaking engagements for the two-time Academy Award winner.

Actress and activist Jane Fonda is the foundation’s president and chairwoman.

The filing lists the 75-year-old 
actress as the foundation’s president and chairman of the board, and 
reports that she devotes 10 hours a week to the charitable group.

It doesn't mean the group was dormant despite its lack of charitable actions.

While Fonda’s Foundation has not been making donations, the group has tried to grow its stash via the stock market.

The foundation’s last tax return lists 166 separate trades involving thousands of stock shares, that netted about $2200.

The
two time Oscar winner also runs a $4 million dollar charity in Atlanta 
called GCAPP– Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power and Potential.

Last year GCAPP gave more than $4.2 million to running their Second Chance Homes for young mothers and their children.

The charity provides education and assistance to teenagers about pregnancy and helps young women throughout Georgia.
