Real Madrid president Florentino Perez has insisted that Cristiano Ronaldo is the 'complete' player, and has no rival when considering who is the best in the world.

The 29-year-old has been in imperious form once again for Los Blancos, with 30 goals in all competitions helping Carlo Ancelotti's men sit top of Spanish top flight, as well as primed and ready for the Champions League knockout stages.

Club World Cup success on the back of a 22-game winning streak capped a memorable 2014 for Madrid, who head in to their winter break with confidence sky high.

And Perez was full of praise for the man who has spearheaded a year of success for the 10-time European champions. 

'Of course he's the most complete, and not only for what he's achieved,' Perez said 

'Without a doubt he's the best.'

The only disappointment for Ancelotti's side in 2014 was missing out their 33rd league crown after being pipped by their city rivals Atletico Madrid on the final day of last season.

However, Perez insisted there are more pressing concerns when dealing with a club of Real's stature.

'This effort is not only to win games, add another title to our trophy cabinet and to continue to grow the legend of Real Madrid, who greatly help the world from a sporting point of view,' Perez added.

'But it also allows us to pass on our values, especially to children.'
