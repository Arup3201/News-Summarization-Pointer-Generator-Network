With a little cap of fresh snow resting on his head, this squirrel tries his best to pull off his new look.

The fox squirrel was photographed by American photographer Walter P. Szymanski, 68, who spotted him foraging in the snow in his back garden. 

The squirrel burrowed under the snow 
while searching for acorns, then he popped up

The fox squirrel was photographed by American photographer Walter P. Szymanski, 68, who spotted it foraging in the snow in his back garden

'While it came up empty handed at times, its head would occasionally be topped with snow.

'It acted similar to a duck diving under the water to find food and then resurfacing.

'Soon after I took these photographs it climbed up a nearby Oak tree, where its nest was located.

'He was probably trying to escape the cold!

The squirrel burrowed under the snow while searching for acorns, then he popped up like a Jack-in-the box, says Walter, of Terre Haute, Indiana

Only 50 feet away from the squirrel, Walter watched as he popped his head up and down in the snow in search for his next meal

'I was simply in the right place at the right time when I spotted this little squirrel in the snow.'

Only 50 feet away from the squirrel, Mr Szymanski watched as he popped his head up and down in the snow in search for his next meal.

Fox squirrels are the largest species of tree squirrels and spend a lot more of their time on the ground than other tree squirrels.

Mr Szymanski says: 'About six to eight inches of fresh snow had fallen that night, and since fox squirrels don't hibernate they must feed daily.

'Snow or no snow they need to find food and the only available food was under the snow.

'Not many people have seen a squirrel actually foraging in the snow for food like this, and so the reaction from the public is generally shocked.'
