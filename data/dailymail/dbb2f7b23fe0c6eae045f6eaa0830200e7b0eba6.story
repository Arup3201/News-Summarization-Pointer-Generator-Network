A transparent futuristic kayak, which makes it look like its rowers are floating on water, is being promoted as the ideal way to take your encounters with sea creatures to a new level.

The space-age vessel is available now for any nature enthusiasts who wish to paddle and fully immerse themselves in the beautiful surroundings around them.

Kayaks have been given an innovative transparent design by Seattle based company Clear Blue Hawaii.  

Unique design: The Molokini kayak produced by Clear  Blue Hawaii boasts a stylish and functional design

The kayaks come with varying policarbonate panels which are made entirely of a clear plastic giving the paddler a crystal clear view.

It has been developed from the same policarbonate material which is used in fighter jet canopies and bulletproof glass. 

But you'll need deep pockets, the Molokini kayak costs £1,654.20 ($2,683.65).

Tests for the unique and stylish looking kayak by developers Clear Blue Hawaii have included encounters with coral farms, nocturnal underwater sea life and pods of dolphins.

Clear Blue Hawaii have promoted the two passenger policarbonate clear kayak as an ideal product for exploring oceanic areas with plentiful marine life and sea creatures.

Open water: The kayak gives paddlers an opportunity to explore the open water like never before

Great views: Paddlers can enjoy views of up to 75 feet below the surface of the water in the kayaks

The kayak is completely clear and transparent  apart from the ergonomically designed seats and the stability system. In clear waters it is possible to see up to 75 feet below the surface of the water.

Those depths of 75 feet plus were visible when successful tests were undertaken during the development stage of the kayak.

Having the opportunity to gaze downwards into the ocean in the clear bottom sea kayak gives paddlers a fantastic opportunity to discover additional marine life and explore areas of the sea which might otherwise remain a mystery.

Tests: During testing coral farms,  underwater sea life and pods of dolphins were viewed in the kayaks

The hull is visually stunning and the  timeless design of the accessories add a sophisticated feel while the curves give the kayak an attractive appearance.

The Molokini kayak  is recommended for use in calm ocean conditions. The company has developed an improved tracking system which is an significant advantage during long distance paddling. 

The science which makes this innovative plastic possible is a Lexan product, a policarbonate, which holds out water.

The innovative developers ignored some concerns from investors, who claimed the Molokini kayak was an affluent niche product, to create an exciting and visually stunning kayak which is certainly original.

Other kayaks: Clear Blue Hawaii also develop a multitude of other kayaks and accessories
