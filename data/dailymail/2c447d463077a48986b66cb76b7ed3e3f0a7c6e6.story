Thousands of workers have been forced to delay their retirement for financial reasons over the last five years, a study shows.

Since 2009, it found, 55 per cent of older workers have put back their previous plans to retire, while one in six has had to put off leaving work indefinitely.

Charities said the study by Saga debunks the myth of a so-called ‘golden generation’ enjoying their gold-plated pensions and profits from property investments.

More than a third of those who delayed leaving their job did so for financial reasons, and one in ten said they were doing it to ‘fund a better retirement’. Nearly a quarter blamed changes to the state pension age

They said low interest rates on savings, combined with a higher state pension age, mean many are having to work for longer.

Old age specialists Saga surveyed more than 9,000 workers, mostly aged 50 to 69. One in three said they now expected to keep working later than planned, and one in ten said it would be ‘a lot later’.

Only 7 per cent said they had brought forward their plans to retire over the past five years.

More than a third of those who delayed leaving their job did so for financial reasons, and one in ten said they were doing it to ‘fund a better retirement’. Nearly a quarter blamed changes to the state pension age.

At present, a woman can claim her pension at age 62, while men receive theirs from the age of 65.

But under current plans, the age for women will match men at 65 by 2018, then both men and women will rise to 66 by 2020 and 67 by 2028. Caroline Abrahams, of charity Age UK, said: ‘While many older people really enjoy working and benefit from all the social aspects workplaces have to offer, others who would like to retire are unable to do so.

Of those who had deferred their retirement, 44 per cent said they planned to retain their current role and hours, while 40 per cent planned to reduce their hours

‘Historically low interest rates, spiralling food and fuel costs, combined with a later State pension age, mean that many people looking forward to a well-deserved retirement have had to change their plans and continue working until they feel financially more secure.’ However, the study also found that more than a fifth of those who delayed their retirement did so because they enjoyed working.

Of these, 7 per cent said it kept them active. Saga welcomed the figures as a sign that many are now able to work for longer if they want or need to.

The default retirement age in the UK was abolished in 2011.

Paul Green, of Saga, said: ‘While some older people are continuing in employment for social reasons, others are doing so for financial reasons.

‘Many people approaching what they thought would be their retirement age have found that the impact of the recession has meant that their pensions will no longer provide the income they had hoped to achieve.

‘Rather than compromise on the quality of life in their retirement, they’ve chosen to continue to work, either full or part-time, to boost their income.’

Of those who had deferred their retirement, 44 per cent said they planned to retain their current role and hours, while 40 per cent planned to reduce their hours.

Only 4 per cent intended to retrain for another job.
