Police are searching for the owners of a collection of gold and silver bullion, coins and doubloons which were discovered under a hedge in Hertfordshire.

The £50,000 find was made in London Colney last month and detectives believe the bullion may have been stolen in a burglary.

The items were mostly found individually wrapped in cellophane or were held in plastic containers.

Hidden treasure: This silver bullion was among a stash of valuable items handed into Hertfordshire Police

Detective Sergeant Karen Lewis, from the St Albans Local Unit, said: 'Despite several enquiries, we have so far been unable to trace the owners of these items. 

'The items are very distinctive so we hope that someone might recognise them and that they can be returned.' 

Anyone who recognises the collection, or who has any information about where it may have come from, is asked to contact DS Lewis on 101. 

Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
