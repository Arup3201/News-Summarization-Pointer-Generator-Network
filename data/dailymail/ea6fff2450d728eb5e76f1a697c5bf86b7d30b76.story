Lukas Podolski has fired a parting shot at Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, accusing him of not showing him respect.

The German joined Inter Milan on loan earlier this week after struggling to force his way into the Gunners first team.

And Podolski revealed that Wenger did not even say goodbye before he left for Italy.

'He said nothing to me. He did not call me or say goodbye,' Podolski told The Sun.

'I don't need flowers or a kiss from him but it is about respect, about saying goodbye. For me respect is important.

'I did everything for the club I possibly could have. I don't believe I did anything wrong. I did not get drunk in a club.'

Podolski did however thank the Arsenal fans as he was unveiled at the Serie A club.

Podolski praised new boss Roberto Mancini who took over for a second spell last November

'I had a great time at Arsenal, I want to thank the fans and the club,' he added. 'I didn't play much and Inter gave me the chance. I had a good chat with [Roberto] Mancini and he made it easy to come.

'I'm at my best when I play in the middle as a No 10 or a striker but we will see what the manager wants.' 

Wenger has since denied the accusations, claiming he did wish the German farewell.

'I deny that completely, I had many conversations with him about going on loan. He needed my permission and I gave him my position.'
