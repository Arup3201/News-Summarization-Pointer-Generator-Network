Oliver Cheshire shows off his rippling abs in a new campaign for designer swimwear brand Orlebar Brown.

Stripping down to just a pair of tiny swim shorts, the model, 25, form London, shows off his incredible physique and striking cheekbones in the smouldering black and white images.

Shot on board a sailing boat, Oliver is joined by a slender female model who in one picture drapes an arm around him as he rests his perfectly sculpted head on her stomach.

In another, Oliver, who has enjoyed a sparkling modelling career of some ten years, is seen embracing her as the pair smile with the wind in their hair.

He was scouted by Select Model Management at just 15 while studying drama and became an overnight success.

'From high fashion to high street 
fashion, everyone gets Oliverâ€™s look,' said Tandy Anderson, founder 
of Select Model Management, in May.

'Like
 a young DiCaprio at the start of his career, in front of the camera he 
has a real versatility and appeal - he's the new everyman of modelling, 
he is genuinely a face to watch out for.'

Casually sailing, Oliver shows that even with his clothes on he still has looks to kill

 recently, Oliver has been the face of Japanese label Superdry and 
features in a high-profile campaign for Marks & Spencer's Best Of 
British line.

The High Street department store reported a 50 per cent increase in sales since getting Oliver on board.

He
 has been dating pop star Pixie Lott, 22, for three years.

He states they 
make their relationship work by staying in contact via Skype when she is
 working overseas.

But Oliver insists they are 'too young' to think about tying the knot anytime soon.

The couple headed out on a romantic date night last Friday and spent the evening at London's Chakana nightclub.

Oliver opted for a chocolate brown leather flight jacket, which he teamed with a navy tee and indigo jeans, as Pixie wore a turquoise biker jacket and plaid skirt.
