An American brewery has been criticised for selling a beer called 'Dumb Blonde' which they claim 'goes down easy'.

The Texas-based Deep Ellum Brewing has been condemned for relying on 'rape culture' to sell the product, which uses a picture of a doll wearing a blonde wig on the can.

The company has also been using the controversial logo and catchphrase on a pink van as part of a marketing campaign to celebrate a year since the drink was first released.

Too far? Dallas Blonde beer which is sold in cans with a picture of a doll wearing a blonde wig with the phrase 'goes down easy' written on the side

In a post on the political blog Burn Orange Report, writer Genevieve Cato said the way the company was selling the beer was 'unacceptable'.

'Deep Ellum's lazy use of this well-worn sexist comparison of women to alcohol is disappointing and insulting to their female customers, but it goes deeper than that.

'You need to look no further than the comments on their Facebook picture to see the way advertising like this fuels the acceptability of rape culture in our society.

'As a craft brewery in Texas, Deep Ellum is already well situated to be profitable and popular amongst beer drinkers across the state.

'It is completely unacceptable, and unnecessary, for breweries to continue to use this kind of language to sell their products.'

John Reardon, who owns the brewery told the Dallas Observer he thinks the rape culture claim went too far.

He said: 'We knew the play on words there,' but insisted Dallas Blonde beer was meant to be fun.

'We're not saying that all blondes go down easy,' he adds.

But, he does admit he has had some negative responses to the advertising campaign.

He has addressed the complaints by email. He also says he's trying to fine the most appropriate way to respond to Cato's article.

He added: 'If there are women out there who are offended, then we should apologise.'
