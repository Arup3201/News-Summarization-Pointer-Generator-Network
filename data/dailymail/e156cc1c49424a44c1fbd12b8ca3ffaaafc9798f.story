A flood victim has been denied an insurance payout because the policy was underwritten by an Icelandic firm whose licence has been withdrawn.

Roslyn Earle arranged cover for her five-bedroom Wiltshire house through the century-old Country Gentlemen’s Association.

The CGA’s brokers placed her policy with European Risk Insurance, which lists an Essex address but is actually based in Reykjavik.

Mrs Earle, 66, submitted a claim after flood water warped solid oak floors, destroyed antique furniture and forced her to flee with only her two cats and a suitcase.

It was only then that she discovered Icelandic regulators had withdrawn European Risk Insurance’s licence amid concern the company did not have enough funds to meet its liabilities.

Homeless and facing mounting debts, Mrs Earle complained to  the UK Ombudsman, but officials suggested she ‘try the Icelandic Ombudsman instead’. The Icelandic authority promised to call back but never did.

Her six children have rented a holiday cottage as a temporary refuge for her because, although the waters have receded, her house is uninhabitable.

Although she may be eligible for partial help under the financial services compensation scheme, she said: ‘I just feel so despairing.

‘The insurance industry has become so complex and I wonder how many more people are in my position without yet knowing it.’
