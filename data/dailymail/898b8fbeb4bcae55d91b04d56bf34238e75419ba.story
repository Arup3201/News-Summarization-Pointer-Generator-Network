A mother and son burgling duo broke into a house and assaulted the homeowner just hours after the teenager had been released from a young offenders' unit.

Tammy and Oliver Wharton were stealing from Susan Connors' house when she discovered them mid-way through the crime and was punched three times in the face.

Teenager Oliver, 18, had been released from a young offenders' institution just a few hours earlier that day.

On May 7 the pair - along with Tammy's partner Steven Gledhill, 32 - took a silver Pandora watch, a gold necklace, an iPod and various items of medication from the house in York.

When Mrs Connors returned home and interrupted the crime, Oliver punched her in the face.

Tammy, 38, and Gledhill ran away and stepped over her as she lay bleeding.

Mrs Connors was so scared she locked herself and a neighbour in the house and now suffers from anxiety.

Giving evidence at York Crown Court during a three day trial, she said: 'We were in a mad panic to get to the door and get it shut and locked to make sure they couldn't get in because we didn't know what was going to happen.

Steven Gledhill, 32, was jailed for four years for his role in the burglary

'He said: "I'm sorry, it was a mistake".'

Tammy, who cried throughout the trial, was sentenced to five years in prison after being found guilty at the end of the trial which finished on Thursday.

Judge Ashurst said: 'I am satisfied those were crocodile tears.

'There is no element of remorse in your case. I accept you did not lay a finger on Mrs Connors, but on the other hand you bear a degree of responsibility for committing this offence with your 18-year-old son.'

Oliver, who admitted his crime, was sent back to a young offenders' institution for four and a half years.

Judge Ashurst told him: 'You are still a very young man and have been given countless opportunities by the youth court and crown court before and you have failed to take them.

'Within only a few hours of your arrival back in York, you were there with your mother and her partner committing a burglary.

'I have no doubt at all that you thought that was perhaps easy pickings for you.'

Steven Gledhill was also sentenced to four years in prison for the burglary.

Detective Constable Martin Hinchliffe of York CID said: "This incident was deeply upsetting for the victim and her family and it is an experience that will take some time to fully come to terms with.

'It is satisfying that the offenders have been made to face up to the consequences of their despicable actions and we hope the victim can take some comfort from the outcome at court.'
