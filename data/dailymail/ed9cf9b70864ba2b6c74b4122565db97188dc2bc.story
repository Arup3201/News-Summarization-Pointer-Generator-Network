International embassies across London are worth a staggering £4 billion between them, according to a new study.

The 140 properties across the city range from the U.S.'s new £600million purpose built fortress in south London to the £750,000 suburban semi in Acton, west London used by North Korea.

The research found eight embassies are estimated to be worth £100million or more, with most located in some of London's most expensive postcodes in Kensington, Knightsbridge and Belgravia. 

The brand new American embassy at Nine Elms in south west London. The purpose-built fortress has been valued at £600million and replaces Grosvenor House, which sold for £500million 

The study also reveals that if the tiny Polynesian island nation of Tuvalu - halfway between Hawawii and Australia - was to sell off its London consulate in Raynes Park, south west London, it would pay off 11 per cent of its national debt of £6.6million.

In addition the figures show that Ecuador's embassy near Harrods in Knightsbridge, currently home to international fugitive Julian Assange is valued at £15million but would increase in value if the Wikileaks founder finally left.

Foreign embassies in the UK are exempt from certain taxes such as council tax and stamp duty if the buildings are sold as non-residential properties.

The research also found that if all the embassy buildings were to be sold, the total amount the UK Treasury would lose out on in stamp duty would be £279.3 million.

The research comes amid figures released last week by the Office for National Statistics show house prices in London have risen by more than 20 per cent in the past year. 

Financial publication Spear's Magazine asked property buying agents Lichfields to value the capital's embassies. 

Josh Spero, from the magazine, said: 'I would say four billion pounds is a conservative estimate - London's embassies are probably worth more than that.

'It's a huge amount of money. The Russian embassy, for example, is easily worth more than £100 million. That is an astonishing value. And almost none of these embassies are for sale.

The Ecuadorian embassy in Knightsbridge, central London near to Harrods has been valued at £15million. But researchers say it would be worth a lot more if Wikileaks founder Julian Assange were to leave the building where he is currently living 

'They paid quite a lot of money for them years ago, but they've increased in value.

'It also comes down to the fact that some of these countries used to have a lot more money.

'However, when they do go for sale they can go very quickly.

'Others are listed buildings which means its very hard to do things with them. Maybe in some cases that depresses the sale value slightly.

'One of the things we looked at was whether countries could afford their own embassies.

'Tuvalu, for example, couldn't - its embassy is valued at over 10 per cent of its national debt.'

Australia House, home to the Australian embassy on the Strand in central London, is worth at least £100million. New research has found that all 140 of London's embassies are worth a combined £4billion 

Asked about the shabby North Korean Embassy, he said: 'It's used for national pride. North Korea aren't interested in glamour.

'They're supposed to be a socialist state that emphasises utilitarianism, rather than western decadence. '

The United States was found to have the priciest embassy with its new Nine Elms site valued at £600 million, £100 million more than its previous site in Grosvenor Square sold for. 

Occupying some of the grandest buildings are Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Russia and Saudi Arabia. 

The embassy of Japan on Piccadilly in central London, which has been valued at £100million. The research revealed that collectively the G7 countries embassies are worth £1.1 billion 

They are all in and around high value postcodes such as Kensington, Piccadilly, Belgravia and Knightsbridge, and have all had their embassies valued at £100million or more.

There are 30 embassies in the SW1X postcode alone, in Belgravia, north of Eaton Square and Knightsbridge. 

The research also shows that collectively the G7 countries embassies are worth the most at £1.1billion, while countries such as Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey - are worth a relatively modest £85million.

The EU embassies were found to be the second most valuable as a group, collectively worth £881million.

Germany's embassy is located on Belgrave Square in Belgravia. EU embassies located in London have been valued as being collectively worth £881million

However, some embassies are less pricey than they appear as it was revealed that Russia pays just £1 a year to run its £100million embassy, Harrington House, in one of the world's most expensive roads, Kensington Palace Gardens.

This is because of a 1991 agreement that allows the UK a luxurious embassy in Moscow for one rouble a year in exchange.

Syria's Belgrave Square embassy was also revealed to be a £35million asset that could keep president Bashar Al Assad going through turbulent times if he chooses to sell it.

The research revealed that Nepal and Zambia are sitting on unexpectedly valuable assets, a £30 million building in Kensington Palace Gardens, and a £40 million house in Kensington.

Mr Spero added that the new US embassy in Nine Elms would form part of a major development that could see other nations flocking to relocate their own embassies.

He explained: 'Obviously some smaller nations as you might expect just had offices or even just consulates.

Meanwhile the North Korean embassy in Acton, west London has been valued at just £750,000. John Spero from Spears Magazine says the embassy is more about national pride than glamour 

'Ecuador's embassy is worth about £15million - it's in Knightsbridge so there's no area of London more expensive. It's right out the back of Harrods.

'I am sure that the Ecuadorean embassy property value would increase if Julian Assange was not there.'

When embassies are sold as non-residential buildings they are usually exempt from stamp duty, which counts as a local tax. This is calculated in bands, according to the sale value of a residential property, with anything retailing for more than £125,000 having a one per cent tax.

Most embassies are likely to fit into the higher bands, taxable at five or seven per cent.

Mr Spero added: 'Embassies are exempt from local tax. If they were to be sold as residential properties you would normally have to pay stamp duty on them.

The Tuvaluan Consulate in Raynes Park, south west London. If the island nation was to sell off its London consulate, the money would pay off 11 per cent of their national debt  

'Obviously the Mayor of London is very unhappy about this, but we don't pay any tax abroad for our embassies.'

Earlier this year it was also revealed that foreign embassies had also notched up more than £75million in unpaid London congestion charge debt over the last decade.

The total value of the congestion charge debt incurred by diplomatic missions and international organisations in London since its introduction in 2003 until the end of last year was £75,364,182.

The US embassy topped the table for the highest number of fines and largest outstanding bill, with 70,637 fines handed out over the ten-year period and a total outstanding bill of £8,172,245.

Meanwhile in 2013, 5,662 unpaid parking fines were incurred by diplomatic missions and international organisations in the UK in 2013 totalling £541,599.
