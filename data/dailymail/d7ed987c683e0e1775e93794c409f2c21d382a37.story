Arsenal defender Gabriel is hoping his late call-up to Dunga's Brazil squad will prove to be a valuable opportunity to further improve his game.

The central defender was a late addition to the Brazil national team, coming in for Paris Saint-Germain duo David Luiz and Marquinhos who withdrew because of injury.

Gabriel will feel right at home if he is chosen to start the game against Chile as it takes place at the Emirates Stadium and the 24-year-old is hoping it will be the first of many caps.

He told the Arsenal website: 'I am very happy with the news, and it is a dream for any player to wear the shirt of your country.

'I'll play the best possible way. It is a valuable opportunity and I hope that is the first call of many.

'It will be an incentive for me to continue working hard at Arsenal. It will not be easy, because the Brazilian team has great quality, but I will work hard to get my place in the team.'
