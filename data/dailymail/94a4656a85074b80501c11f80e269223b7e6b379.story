Spring flower sellers have had to throw away £50million worth of stock because of the prolonged winter weather that has hit Britain.

Freezing conditions have stopped people from tending to their gardens which would normally be filled with colourful plants bought from garden centres.

Due to the lack of demand, independent growers and nurseries have been unable to sell on their stock to stores like B&Q and Homebase.

Ditched: A truckload of spring flowers are dumped by the Blue Ribbon nursery near Chichester, Hampshire, because the weather has caused a huge slump in demand

Waste: Walter Back, 70, said it has been the worst spring he can remember in 50 years of growing flowers

Thrown out: Some flower retailers are likely to go to the wall because the harsh spring weather has seen sales slump

They are now having to make room for their summer flowers like geraniums, petunias and begonias and have no choice but to bin spring plants such as pansies, primroses and violas by the lorry load.

After weeks of bad weather that has kept gardeners inside, forecasters expect spring to finally arrive next week.

Temperatures could hit 20C on Sunday and it is likely to remain warm for the following few days.

The warmest day of the year so far was March 6 when it was 17.5C in Trawscoed, Wales, but that should be topped this weekend.

Met Office forecaster Charlie Powell said that after a mild Sunday, we will finally get a spell of spring weather.

'We won't quite see temperatures of 17, 18 or 19C on Monday but temperatures are still going to be in the mid-teens. It will be something a bit more average for the time of year,' he said.

'It will also be warmer at night so we won't see any return to freezing conditions. There will be some decent spells of sunshine but some showers here and there across the south and west of England and Wales.

Three-day forecast: The weather is set to remain wet into the weekend - but on Sunday it will improve and temperatures could hit 20C

On an episode of Gardener's World last month, Monty Don urged viewers not to hurry into their gardens. He said: 'There's no great hurry to sow seed, so don't panic'

'The winds will start to ease and everywhere should be in double figures.

'Tuesday is likely to be cloudy away from the south-east with some rain but nothing heavy.'

But the improvement in the weather will come too late for Britain's flower retailers who will have to dump an estimated 30million individual plants because of the bad start to the year.

The British Protected Ornamentals Association (BPOA) which represents 170 plant growers in the UK, say that on average each member has lost nearly £300,000 worth of plants.

It is a 'double whammy' for nurseries that have also had to pay more in energy bills to heat their huge greenhouses to keep the spring flowers alive for as long as possible.

It is feared some growers will be forced out of business by the end of the year even if the sun does come out.

There may be more bleak news for growers
in years to come because forecasters warned that Britain's winters are 
getting colder because of melting Arctic ice changing global weather 
patterns.

Late bloom: Alan Shipp, 74, is pictured in his field of Hyacinths, which are finally beginning to burst into flower, much later than in recent years due to the cold weather earlier in the year

Finally flowering: Mr Shipp has been growing hyacinths since the end of World War Two and has 190 varieties on his farm

Figures released yesterday revealed that the temperature in 
Aberdeenshire fell to -11.2 degrees Celsius on April 2 – this is the 
lowest recorded April temperature for almost 100 years.

Met Office climate change expert Dr Julia Slingo is concerned that shrinking sea ice in the Arctic could be responsible.

‘If this is how climate change could manifest itself, then we need to understand that as a matter of urgency,’ she told ITV News.

Revelations that planters are facing a bleak spring come after the BBC's Monty Don became embroiled in row with the gardening industry after he recently told viewers of Gardener's World to delay planting until the weather improved.

Rubbish: Another truck load of flowers are dumped. An estimated 30million will have to be thrown out nationwide, hitting independent retailers hard

Thrown away: Flower sales have been hit because March was the coldest on record for over 50 years, with an average temperature across the country of just 2.2C

The presenter's statement upset garden centre retailers, who said the advice hampered their sales figures during the spring months.

March was the coldest on record for over 50 years, with an average temperature across the country of just 2.2C.

Ian Riggs, chairman of the BPOA, said the cold weather has affected growers both big and small.

He said: 'Because of the cold weather there have been very low sales of spring plants at garden centres across the country.

'People have just not stepped out into their gardens to fill their borders and pots with primroses and pansies this spring because it has been so cold.

Stock clearout: Blue Ribbon Plants, run by Walter Black with his wife Anja and son Robert, has thrown out nearly £100,000 worth of spring plants

Wasted: Spring stock is being thrown out to make way for summer stock after low sales in the first four months of the year

'The problem is growers would normally have cleared their glass houses of spring plants by now, leaving room for the summer plants.

'But because sales have been incredibly low all of the spring plants are still there.

'They are having to literally bin millions of perfectly good plants that are now in full colour and this dumping has been going on on a large scale across the country.

'It is a double-whammy to the industry because growers are losing money from lack of sales and have also paid more in energy costs to keep those plants in green houses.

'We estimate losses to growers across the country could total around £50million. Last year was bad enough because of the wet summer, but this is a much bigger blow.

'Even if everything went well and our members sold 100 per cent of their summer stock, this year can't be rescued because that income and profit just cannot be recovered.

Waste: Independent growers would usually sell their stock to stores like B&Q and Homebase but demand has been down because of the weather

Sea of waste: Mr Back called for garden centres to shoulder some of the cost of the losses in the future

Waste: Mr Back said 'It is incredibly frustrating to have to throw away perfectly good, beautiful flowers'

'I fear some of the businesses may not be with us this time next year. There are some growers who will decide to call it a day.'

At one nursery in Chichester, West Sussex, owner Walter Back watched helplessly as lorry-load after lorry-load of beautiful primroses were dumped on to a large pile of perfectly healthy plants that will be turned to compost.

Mr Back, 70, who runs Blue Ribbon Plants with his wife Anja and son Robert, has thrown out nearly £100,000 worth of spring plants.

He said it has been the toughest time he has experienced since he went into business 51 years ago.

Mr Back said: 'It's been a terrible year and the worst I can remember since starting out in 1962. It is the worst I have seen it for such a sustained period of time.

'We've had 12 months of terrible weather. There won't be any businesses left the way it has been going.

'It is incredibly frustrating to have to throw away perfectly good, beautiful flowers.'

Rubbish: Although the weather is set to improve this weekend, it will come too late for Britain's plant growers who are being forced to ditch stock that hasn't sold because of the dismal start to the year

Rubbish: These plants are all destined for the bin because they have not sold

He called for garden centres to shoulder some of the cost of the losses in the future.

He said: 'At the moment if the garden centres decide they don't want to buy the plants - which they tell us beforehand that they want - they don't have to pay anything at all and we are left out of pocket.

'It would be much fairer if the cost was shared 50/50.'

He added: 'The weather seems to be turning now so I just hope it will start to take off.'

On an episode of Gardener's World broadcast last month, Monty Don urged viewers not to hurry into their gardens.

He said: 'There's no great hurry to sow seed, so don't panic. Don't be in a hurry. You don't have to sow anything at all until April.'

Industry experts said Mr Don's comments were inaccurate and wrong.

Peter Burks, chairman of the Garden Centre Association, said: 'People who don't know that much about gardening will listen to Monty's comments and wrongly assume they can't plant anything until April - which is not the case.

'There are many plants, such as shrubs, roses and trees, that can be planted well before April, even through the winter and into autumn.'
