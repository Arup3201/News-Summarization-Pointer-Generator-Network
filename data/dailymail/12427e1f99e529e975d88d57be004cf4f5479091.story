A widower whose wife was killed in front of their toddler son when an 85-year-old driver confused the pedals of his car has made an impassioned plea for his family's story to be used as a cautionary tale against dangerous driving among the elderly.

Ben Brooks-Dutton said he has been left 'utterly bereft' by the loss of his wife Desreen, killed in 2012 by pensioner Geoffrey Lederman in Hampstead, north west London.

Lederman was jailed this week for 18 months for mistaking the accelerator of his 1950s Mercedes for its brake.

Despite his grief, Mr Brooks-Dutton said he never wanted to see the man behind bars. No amount of suffering on the part of the man culpable for his wife's death would relieve his heartache.

But in a moving plea to families concerned their elderly relatives may not be fit enough to drive, the 35-year-old father has begged them to share his story. 

Here, the MailOnline publishes Mr Brooks-Dutton's request, Tell Them.

Desreen Brooks was killed in 2012 in front of her husband Ben (pictured together) and their son

'The eighty-five-year-old driver who killed my wife, Desreen, was jailed today for eighteen months for causing her death by dangerous driving. He was also banned from driving for life.

'I suspect he, his family and friends are feeling really quite dreadful right now, and, for what it’s worth, mine and I aren’t exactly celebrating either.

Geoffrey Lederman was jailed for 18 months last week

'You see, I’ve had time to think since attending the trial and I’ve realised that you can punish a crime but you can’t transfer pain. 

'Any suffering caused to the defendant as a result of his sentencing could in no way take away mine. I’ve since learned that, having suffered so much myself, I genuinely wish no hurt on any other person and I never wished a prison sentence on the driver, either.

'In fact, I wasn’t even going to mention the sentencing on my blog at all.

'But then I reminded myself that justice for Desreen is best served not by a prison sentence but by trying to prevent similar unnecessary deaths from happening again in future. 

'I keep hearing people say that they know someone who should probably give up driving but that they don’t know how to raise the issue with them. Well maybe I can help with that.

'Tell them that the judge who sentenced the driver today said, ‘An elderly driver who knows, or should acknowledge, that he or she is losing his or her faculties is no less a danger than a drunken driver who knows the same.’

'Tell them that the judge also explained that the defendant’s ‘lifetime of blameless driving is of no comfort to the Brooks-Dutton family,’ (and I assure you it really isn’t).

'Tell them that the detective sergeant in charge of the prosecution said, ‘It is important for motorists to regularly monitor their driver behaviour and that of their elderly relatives to ensure that the roads are safe for all road users.’

'Tell them that the once ‘blameless’ elderly driver suffered pedal confusion, which caused his car to be travelling at an average of fifty-four miles per hour in a twenty zone when he struck and killed my wife.

'Tell them that the impact of this pedal confusion caused one of her shoes to fly off her feet as his speeding car hit her on the pavement where she was walking blamelessly with our then two-year-old son and me. 

'Tell them that I had to keep looking at that shoe in the street on the night of her death and in photographs over the course of the subsequent trial.

'Tell them that this is the last photo ever taken of my wife with our son together. Tell them that the paramedics on the scene later that evening had to cut off the jumper she is pictured wearing in order to be able to perform CPR on the pavement where she lay dying.

'Tell them this is the last photo ever taken of my wife with our son together. The paramedics on the scene later that evening had to cut off the jumper she is pictured wearing to perform CPR'

'Tell them the collision investigator found a piece of the pushchair my son is pictured in in the street after the car skimmed it before mowing down his mother'

'Tell them that the day after my wife was killed my son was upset that he couldn’t find his scooter. Tell them that’s because his scooter was found in the wreckage too.'

'Tell them that what happened was almost even more catastrophic and that the car that killed my wife almost killed our son too. 

'Tell them that the collision investigator found a piece of the pushchair he is pictured in here in the street after the car skimmed it before mowing down his mother.

'Tell them that the day after my wife was killed my son was upset that he couldn’t find his scooter. Tell them that’s because his scooter was found in the wreckage too. 

'Tell them that every time I look at my favourite picture of my wife and me together I get upset as I imagine how I lost the hat I am pictured wearing on the night of her death. 

'Tell them that I’ve concluded that I must have inadvertently thrown it into the street as I pulled at my own hair through fear that she was going to die.

Tell them they won’t be the only people who have to deal with the consequences of any potential injury or fatality that they might cause. 

'Tell them the impact will be felt by more people than they can imagine including their own family and friends.

'Tell them that the two-year-old boy who lost his mummy is now four and is still so angry and upset that she can’t come back. 

'Tell them that he has suffered immeasurably from the trauma of that night.

'Show them this picture and tell them that this is him pictured with his beautiful mummy on his second birthday – the last one they would ever spend together.

'Tell them that at thirty-one years old I was the happiest man alive when I married the love of my life. 

'Tell them that I was utterly bereft when I lost her at thirty-three. 

'Show them this picture and tell them that this is him pictured with his beautiful mummy on his second birthday – the last one they would ever spend together'

Tell them that every time I look at my favourite picture of my wife and me together I get upset as I imagine how I lost the hat I am pictured wearing on the night of her death

'Tell them I’ve thirty-five now and depressed. 

'Tell them that I put a good face on but that the truth is that things haven’t really got much easier. Tell them from me how hard it is to be a bereaved single parent.

'Tell them that once disaster strikes no wishing the tables could be turned will help. 

'Tell them that wanting to switch places with the young person killed will make no difference to those who survive.

'Tell them that you understand that they may want to stay mobile but remind them of what’s at risk.

'Tell them any of these things you like; print this blog post off, email it on, share it online and let it speak for itself.

'Tell me you’ll help prevent this happening again, though.

'Just tell me that so that one day I can tell my son that his mother’s death wasn’t completely in vain.'
