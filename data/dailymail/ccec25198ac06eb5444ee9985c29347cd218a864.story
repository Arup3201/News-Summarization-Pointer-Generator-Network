Barbie's bodily dimensions might suggest she seldom eats, but that doesn't mean her fans don't get peckish once in a while.

And now the 54-year-old doll's most ardent admirers have somewhere really special to sate their rumbling tummies: Taiwan's newly opened Barbie Cafe.

The hot-pink diner licensed by Mattel - the US toy-maker who created Barbie, Ken and all their plastic pals - has opened its garish doors in Taipei, the capital city of Taiwan and the place where Barbies were originally manufactured until production was relocated to China in the 1960s for financial reasons.

The 600sq metre cafe - which sells 
Barbie-themed food and drink including macaroons, iced biscuits, sundaes
and cakes - is located in the shopping district of Taipei.

Its interior is heaped with hot-pink sofas, 
neon pink tables shaped like stilleto heels, chairs decorated with fuzzy
pink tutus and red corsets and illustrations of Barbie herself in a number of different outfits.

Staff wear bright pink Barbie logo 
T-shirts, pink tutus, Barbie armbands and sparkly tiaras.

Mattel's aim is for the dolly-themed eatery to boost the Barbie label as a fashion brand. Similar versions of the waitresses' uniforms are available on the Mattel website, and lines even include tutus for toddlers.

Iggy Yip, a senior manager at Mattel's Greater China division, said: 'We picked Taiwan because theme restaurants are very popular and successful here.

'We are very confident that the Barbie Cafe can promote our brand image.'

It is hoped the caf√© will attract Barbie fans from China, Hong Kong and Japan. Taiwan used to manufacture the Barbie dolls until the 1980s, when Mattel moved its production lines to China.

Local office worker Jessica Ho, who has a five-year-old daughter, approved of the new diner. She said: 'My child and I both love Barbie and this lovely and cute place is like a dream come true for us. I will take her here to celebrate her next birthday.'

But Rhiannon Williams, editor of feminist website The Vagenda Magazine, told the Telegraph: 'I cannot imagine anything less pleasant and more nausea-inducing than a Barbie themed restaurant.

'Not only because I prefer low-impact environments and none of the major food groups are pink for a reason, but also because Barbie is an outdated model of stereotypical femininity and needs to die a death.'

Mattel launched a Barbie concept store and eatery in China in 2009 when it celebrated the doll's 50th birthday, but it was closed down after two years after failing to get off the ground.
