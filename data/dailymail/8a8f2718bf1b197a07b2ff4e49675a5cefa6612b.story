Romelu Lukaku has apologised for any offence caused by his comments regarding Nicolas Anelka earlier this week.

Lukaku, the 20-year-old Belgium striker who is on loan at Everton from Chelsea, featured in a video interview posted on the Toffees' website in which he said there did not have to be 'such a big deal' made about Anelka's controversial 'quenelle' celebration and that he thought the West Brom frontman should not be banned over it.

The quenelle, a pose Anelka struck after scoring against West Ham on December 28, has been labelled anti-Semitic and an inverted Nazi salute, and Anelka must respond to a Football Association charge concerning his demonstration of it by 6pm on Thursday.

Lukaku said in a statement: 'I want to make clear that I was supporting a friend and player I have admired since I was a child.

'I apologise if I caused any offence with my comments as this was never my intention.

'There has been a misunderstanding and I want to clarify that I was in no way endorsing the gesture made by Nicolas.'

The statement was issued through anti-discrimination group Kick It Out, for whom Lukaku is an ambassador.

Reports had suggested he faced being dropped from that role as a result of the interview.

And
 alongside the Lukaku statement, Kick It Out also on Thursday issued one
 from the group, saying: 'Kick It Out has sought clarity from Romelu 
Lukaku on comments made to Sky Sports about Nicolas Anelka and the FA 
investigation into the 'quenelle' gesture (the interview that appeared 
on Everton's website).

'Romelu has clearly stated that he had no intention to support the gesture made by Anelka.

'The
 campaign continues to work with Romelu as a 'Next 20' ambassador and 
will look to guide him, in partnership with community organisations, on 
the sensitivity of issues covering all forms of discrimination moving 
forward.'

Lukaku added in 
his statement: 'I am proud to be a 'Next 20' ambassador for Kick It Out 
and will continue to inform young people of the harmful effects 
discrimination of any kind can have.'

Acrobat: Lukaku tries an ambitious attempt on goal during Everton's draw at West Brom

December 28, 2013

After
 scoring in West Brom’s 3-3 draw at West Ham, striker Nicolas Anelka 
celebrates by making the quenelle — an inverted Nazi salute created by 
his friend, controversial French comedian Dieudonne M’bala M’bala — 
which has anti-Semitic connotations.

The
 gesture is relatively unknown in the UK but there is an angry reaction 
in France with the country’s sports minister calling Anelka’s actions 
‘disgusting’.

Headline: Martin Samuel called for Anelka to be kicked out for the gesture

Anelka
 says on Twitter: ‘I am neither racist nor anti-Semitic. The meaning of 
quenelle is anti-system. I do not know what religion has to do with this
 story. With regard to the ministers who give their own interpretations 
of my quenelle, they are the ones that create confusion.’

The FA reveal that they are working with an ‘appointed expert’ as part of their investigations into  Anelka’s quenelle. But the delay in making a decision is widely criticised.

West
 Brom’s shirt sponsors Zoopla threaten to end their £3million deal 
unless Anelka is axed. They say they will remove the Zoopla name from 
the home shirts if he is picked for the next match.

Just hours before Monday’s
 kick-off against Everton, Zoopla, who have sponsored West Brom since 
2012, announce that they will not renew their deal with the club at the 
end of the season as a result of Anelka’s gesture.
