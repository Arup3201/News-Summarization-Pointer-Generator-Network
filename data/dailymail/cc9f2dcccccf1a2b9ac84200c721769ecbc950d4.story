The wife of a former Florida mayor is in court this week, accused of beating his new girlfriend - and her former friend - to death with a hammer.

Sheila Graham-Trott, 48, was arrested in February 2010 for the first-degree murder of her friend Kelly Brennan, who betrayed her by dating her husband, former Indialantic Mayor Dan Trott, when the two separated. Graham-Trott's mother turned her into police four years ago when her daughter led family to Brennan's body.

But the defense is hoping to win the case, by proving that Graham-Trott wasn't the only person who had an interest in killing Brennan. They argue that her Brennan's husband, Gino Rallo, was heartbroken at their own impending divorce, enough to kill. Graham-Trott also has an alibi - surveillance footage which shows her at a Walgreen's at the time of Brennan's brutal murder.

On Tuesday, Graham-Trott's sons Creighton and Graham took the stand to testify about the day their mother led them to Brennan's body in a wooded area. 

Brennan was reported missing when she didn't show up the gym, where she said she would meet her boyfriend Trott. 

Creighton talked about coming home one evening, with his brother Graham worried that their mother was experiencing a seizure. 

So they took her to the hospital, and she later woke up saying she had a dream Brennan had been hurt. 

Resting place: Graham-Trott allegedly led her two sons to Brennan's body after the murder. She was found beaten to death with a hammer, still wearing her spandex gym outfit 

Ashamed: Creighton (left) and Graham Trott (right) testified against their mother in court on Tuesday. They spoke about the time she led them to Brennan's body after saying she had a dream the woman had been hurt 

Eventually they drove with their mother to a wooded area called Mark's Landing where they found Brennan's butchered body.  

'Graham called us over and he's like, "I think I see something". So we walked over and saw a body...just a shadow of a body that was in some sort of spandex work-out uniform.' 

The two sons did not turn their mother in, but told her 'you're going to have to deal with this yourself. We're out of this' when they returned home. 

Graham-Trott's mother eventually called police to report the murder. 

The Trott sons' testimonies followed that of Gino Rallo on Monday, as the defense attempted to prove he was enraged after hearing of his wife's affair, and would have killed her so she wouldn't be with another man. They also say a large life insurance pay out could have been motivation. 

Possible suspect? The defense is attempting to argue that Brennan's husband Gino Rallo had motivation to kill her as well. He took the stand on Monday

Rallo and Brennan were also going through a divorce when she started seeing Trott, and allegedly the two got into a physical fight when she told her husband she was leaving the house. 

Reported: Graham-Trott was arrested after her mother turned her in to police 

 'You started slamming her against the wall and putting your hands around her neck. Isn't that true Mr. Rallo?' the defense asked.

Rallo downplayed the fight, saying they 'wrestled in the garage' as they were having a discussion about her moving out.

However, Rallo did admit to being torn up at the break up with his wife of seven years, and said he never reconciled himself with their separation. 

'Mr. Rallo, you loved your wife?' a defense attorney asked Rallo.

'Very much,' he said. 

'Even after you found out she’d been cheating on you behind your back for several months?' the attorney asked.

'Yes,' Rallo said.

'You still wanted to be with her?' the attorney asked.

'Yes,' he said. 

He said he did not kill his wife for $250,000 insurance money, when asked by the prosecution.  

Graham-Trott has pleaded not guilty of Brennan's murder. She was married to Trott for 20 years.
