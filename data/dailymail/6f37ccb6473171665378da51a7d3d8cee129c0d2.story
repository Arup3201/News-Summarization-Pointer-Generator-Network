Nicklas Bendtner has joined Bundesliga club VfL Wolfsburg to end a nine-year association with English football.

The striker, who has scored 24 goals in 58 internationals for Denmark, has signed a three-year deal with an option for a further year at Wolfsburg, who finished fifth in last season's Bundesliga to qualify for the group stages of the Europa League.

A free agent since his contract with Arsenal expired this summer, Bendtner also played for Birmingham City and Sunderland as well as spending a season on loan at Serie A side Juventus during their title-winning campaign in 2012-13.

Finally settled: Bendtner has been linked to several clubs across Europe over the summer

The 26-year-old scored 24 goals in 106 appearances for Arsenal during a nine-year stint in England.

Bendtner attracted interest from Aston Villa and Eintracht Frankfurt this summer, and has been training on his own and with friends in a bid to keep fit ahead of the new campaign.

Bendtner will wear the No 3 shirt at Wolfsburg, and admitted the reason for the low number, saying: ‘My mother chose the number for me.' 

Wolfsburg boss Dieter Hecking said: 'We want to play a good role in all three competitions this season, and to do this we need players who already know what this kind of challenge is all about.

'Nicklas embodies precisely the kind of striker we were looking for. He fits the profile and is going to strengthen our squad.'

Wolfsburg director of sport Klaus Allofs has every faith that Bendtner, who scored 32 goals in 136 Premier League appearances, will make the German club even stronger this term.

'He's in his prime and, although his career has not always gone smoothly, he's still been able to gain plenty of international experience,' he said.

'With his ability, he's going to raise the quality of our attack.'

Hecking had said on Thursday before signing Bendtner that they couldn't sign the top calibre of players.

‘We dared to touch the top shelf of players. It’s empty now though, so we need to look a bit further down.’
