The mystery surrounding the death of an American backpacker in Vietnam deepened today after police said she did not die from poisoning.

American Karin Joy Bowerman, 27, from Illinois, was sharing a room with her friend, Canadian-born Cathy Huynh, 26, at a guesthouse  in the coastal city of Nha Trang, when she fell ill and later died.

While she was suffering from serious respiratory failure and her blood pressure had dropped to zero, she had no apparent injuries.

Sudden death: Teacher Karin Joy Bowerman (left), 27, from the United States, quickly deteriorated after being admitted to hospital and died. Two days later, her friend Canadian-born Cathy Huynh, 26, (right) died.

Two days later, Miss Huynh, who is of Vietnamese origin, was treated in the same hospital for 
symptoms of shock and while under intensive care, reportedly suffered
several cardiac arrests and died.

Initially it was suspected the women died of some kind of poisoning, possibly alcohol.

But today,
a Nha Trang city police leader told Tuoi Tre newspaper: '(Miss 
Bowerman) died from breathing failure, circulatory collapse due to brain
edema 
(swelling caused by fluid).

'No toxic traces have been found in her blood and gastric fluids.'

He said because no poison was found in her system, there was no grounds to open a criminal investigation.

Before their trip to Vietnam, the two women had both taught English at a university in South Korea.

Following Miss Bowerman and Miss Huynh's deaths on July 30 and August 2 respectively, forensic official Pham Xuan Thong said it was likely they had been poisoned. 

According to Vietnamese newspaper Tuoi Tre News, Miss Bowerman's family requested their daughter be cremated in Ho Chi Minh City and her ashes sent to their Illinois home.

Miss Huynh’s family had refused to have an autopsy done on her as they say the two friends died in the same way so Miss Bowerman's autopsy would be enough.

'I’m deeply saddened and mournful,' Miss Huynh's mother, Huynh Thi Huong, said at the time.

Having flown to Vietnam to complete the paperwork to bring her daughter’s 
body home, she added: 'We would like to bring her body to 
Canada for funeral because all my family members in Canada want to see 
her for the last time.'

The 57-year-old mother has blamed doctors and nurses for her daughter’s death.

'I’m really angry at the irresponsibility of the hospital staff. She died because she did not receive proper medical care despite the fact that she had been admitted to the hospital 12 hours before her death,' Mrs Huong told the newspaper.

Cathy's brother, Michael, who came to 
support his mother said the family was struggling to come to terms with 
the devastating news.

'All my family members are extremely saddened by her death,' he said.

The family set up a website to raise 
the $40,000 needed to fly Miss Huynh's body back to Canada.

Tuoi Tre News reported that police investigating the mysterious deaths suggested the pair had died from drinking too much alcohol.

The
unnamed forensic investigator from Khanh Hoa province's police 
department told the newspaper he believed 'drinking too much wine' might
have led to the women's deaths.

But Mrs Huong attacked the claims, insisting her daughter was not a big drinker.

Beach destination: Nha Trang is well known for its pristine beaches and scuba diving and is fast becoming a popular destination for international tourists.

Picturesque: Holidaymakers are attracted to the area for its natural beauty.

'She often drank a little at parties but she never consumed beer or wine during vacations,' she said.

Dr Mai Dinh Trung, former head of
the Khanh Hoa Province General Hospital’s emergency service and 
intensive care unit, also ruled out alcohol poisoning as the cause.

An employee at the morgue 
of the Khanh Hoa General Hospital told Tuoi Tre News that Cathy Huynh's 
body had been sent in without any clothes on, just a piece of fabric pulled over her.

When he was told that the victim’s 
family want her to have clothes on, the staff member said that the 
morgue would not supply clothes.

But he said he would ask the hospital to provide her with something to wear or would buy something himself because 'this is humane'.

Poisoned: Two Canadian sisters, Noemi and Audrey Belanger, pictured, were found dead in their hotel room in Thailand

The incident follows the recent deaths of two Canadian sisters in Thailand.

The bodies of Audrey and Noemi Belanger,
aged 20 and 26, were found on June 15 by hotel staff on Phi Phi island 
in the Andaman Sea, 800 km south of Bangkok.

Forensic officials found vomit in the 
room, blood on their lips and gums and their fingernails and toenails 
were blue. Lieutenant colonel Rat Somboon of Krabi Provincial Police added there were 'signs of serious food poisoning.'
