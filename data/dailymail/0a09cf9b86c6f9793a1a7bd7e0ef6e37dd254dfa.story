A 17-year-old Delaware boy has been accused of shooting his father dead with a crossbow because he was caught skipping school. 

Seth Ramsey has been charged with the first degree murder of Todd, 41, who was found dead in a bedroom of the family home in Harrington.

According to law enforcement, the younger Ramsey said his father had been in his bedroom and knew he had skipped classes at Lake Forest High School in Harrington, Delaware.

Detained: Seth Ramsey, 17, has been accused of killing his father with a crossbow while he had skipped school. He allegedly thought he would be mad that he had stayed home 

Fearing he would be mad, he shot him with the weapon as he entered the room.  

According to the police affidavit obtained by ABC 6, the teen told police he missed school on Tuesday.

Authorities were first alerted by the victim's co-workers visited who said he had not been at work for work for a couple of days.

They then arrived at his house where one of them supposedly spoke to the youngster who claimed he had killed his father.  

It read: 'He said that his father was in his bedroom from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Seth said that he knew when his father came out he would be mad so he shot him.'

He is being held at a juvenile detention facility without bail. Ramsey was also charged with weapon possession during commission of a felony. 

During an official statement, Master Cpl. Gary E. Fournier said that no motive had been established for the deaths. 

On Facebook, the father and son shared photos of them playing baseball together.

It is unclear who they lived with at the address and whether anyone else was in the house at the time. 

Warning signs: Authorities were first alerted by the victim's co-workers visited who said he had not been at work for work for a couple of days. Todd, 41, (pictured) was then found dead in his home
