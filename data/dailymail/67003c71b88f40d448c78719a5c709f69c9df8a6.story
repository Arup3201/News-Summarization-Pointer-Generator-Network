The woman who accused Dominique Strauss-Kahn of rape allegedly grew angry when he refused to pay her for sex, it emerged today.

The hotel maid, who has now been accused of working as a prostitute, allegedly performed a sex act on him in his room at the Sofitel in Manhattan.

She originally told police she did not know who the former IMF chief and that he raped her in his suite.

But the case against the millionaire has fallen apart after it emerged the woman had told prosecutors a series of lies.

Sources now claim she was aware of his VIP status and became angry when he refused to pay her for her sexual services.

A source close to the defence investigation told the New York Post: 'She figured he's a rich dude, and she would get paid. She was told by the crew she ran with that this was a gold mine.'

The maid, a West African native, told police that on May 14, while she was cleaning Strauss Kahn's suite, he forced her to perform oral sex on him and violently groped her breasts and vagina, leaving her bruised.

But the source told the Post that the 32-year-old maid regularly got paid for sex at the hotel and she performed oral sex on the Frenchman in exchange for money.

But when they were finished and the woman demanded money from him, Strauss Kahn refused to pay.

'There was an expectation of money after the fact, but he was dismissive,' the source said. 'He turned his back on her and got dressed.

'She remained in the room with him while he got dressed for at least nine minutes.'

The humiliating exchange sparked the maid's anger, prosecutors suspect.

Though she told police after she reported the alleged attack that she did not know who Strauss Kahn was - who at the time was being touted as the next President of France - she was reportedly on the phone the following day with a jailed drug dealer talking about a potential windfall if she pursued charges.

A letter from prosecutors also revealed that she lied about what actually happened on the day.

It said: 'In the weeks following the incident charged in the indictment, the complainant told detectives and assistant district attorneys on numerous occasions that, after being sexually assaulted . . . she fled to an area of the main hallway of the hotel's 28th floor and waited there until she observed the defendant . . . entering an elevator.'

She said she then alerted her supervisor and waited for him.

The maid later told this version of 
events to the police and to a grand jury but then finally admitted that 
she cleaned a nearby room and Dominique Strauss Kahn's room before she 
reported the incident to her supervisor.

The DA's case has fallen into turmoil, and Strauss-Kahn was freed of his strict bail conditions.

Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. 
Vance, Jr. said prosecutors will keep investigating 'until we have 
uncovered all relevant facts.'

He said: 'Sometimes the road to get 
to the truth has twists and turns in it, which are not always apparent 
at the outset. What is important is not a win or a loss, but rather to 
ensure the criminal justice system balances the rights of all those who 
come before it.'

Speculation is mounting that Strauss-Kahn may run for the French presidency in next year’s elections, but commentators have suggested that the case against him may still cause him damage.

Michael Powell, columnist for the New York Times, said: ‘When the debate is between those who accuse you of rape and those who defend you as a mere disgusting cad, your image problems have not emerged from critical care.’

A poll last night revealed that the French people were split over whether Strauss-Kahn should run for the presidency.

Some 49 per cent of those surveyed said they would like him to come back to French politics ‘one day’ while 45 per cent said no.

Meanwhile Michele Sebban, one of Strauss-Kahn’s close allies, claimed yesterday that the court case was a ‘political assassination’.

It was also revealed that while the maid
was being put up in a Brooklyn hotel by prosecutors, she continued to 
work as a prostitute.

According to the Post, a number of paying male visitors arrived at the maid's hotel in the weeks after Strauss Kahn's arrest.

The source said: 'While she was under our supervision, there were multiple "dates" and encounters at the hotel on the DA's dime. That's a great deal for her. She doesn't have to cover her expenses.'

The woman has a regular fleet of gentlemen callers who range from wealthy clients she met at the Sofitel to counterfeit-merchandise hawkers and livery-cab drivers, said sources close to the defence investigation.

Some of her clients also gave her pricey jewellery, the source said.

The woman is still being housed by the DA's Office but it is unclear if it is the same location or how much money has been spent to house her, the source said.

Also, the DA suspects that the $100,000 she deposited into her accounts over the last few years included proceeds from sex-for-money exploits, said another prosecution source.
