All of a sudden, Manchester City have gone from looking ahead to a title race to glancing nervously over their shoulders in the chase for a Champions League spot.

The seven-point advantage that Chelsea have opened up over the Premier League champions is the same gap that now exists between City and Arsenal in sixth. 

Southampton lead the pack of clubs breathing down their necks.

James Milner’s late equaliser ended his run of 36 league games without a goal.

City have failed to win in their last five games, including home defeats by Arsenal in the league and Middlesbrough in the FA Cup.

It represents their worst run since late 2009 when the ‘trajectory of results’ signalled the end for Mark Hughes, who will be relishing the opportunity to do the double over his old club when City visit Stoke on Wednesday night.

Based on the fate of his predecessors, Manuel Pellegrini should be a worried man. City’s record after 24 games is almost identical to the post-title slump in 2012-13 when they trailed United by seven points at the same stage.

Roberto Mancini finished that season empty-handed and paid for it with his job.

There is no suggestion that Pellegrini is under threat just yet, and the Chilean has already pulled a rabbit out of the hat in the Champions League once this season.

The way things are shaping up, City’s two encounters with Barcelona could have a decisive impact on Pellegrini’s future.

After snatching a late point against struggling Hull City, Samir Nasri is not alone in believing that City are running out of time to put things right. 

‘We have to wake up and do the job now before it’s too late,’ said Nasri. ‘Chelsea, with no disrespect, are not Liverpool who can drop points. They are really solid.

‘We have to catch them as soon as possible if we want to be champions. But at the same time we have to look behind us. Southampton have won, United are getting close.

Manager Manuel Pellegrini accepted his team were lacking in ideas during their game against Hull

‘It will be tough at Stoke. It’s not ideal on a Wednesday night during the winter, but we have to win it.’

City will not be able to call on Yaya Toure or new £28million striker Wilfried Bony at the Britannia Stadium, with the two Ivory Coast internationals not expected back from Equatorial Guinea until Tuesday after playing in the Africa Cup of Nations final on Sunday night.

On Saturday, James Milner scored with a 92nd-minute free-kick to deny Hull after David Meyler had given the relegation strugglers a deserved, if scrappy, lead.

Talks over a new contract for Milner remain deadlocked but Pellegrini says he is confident the England midfielder can be persuaded to stay beyond this season.
