A couple whose dying daughter 'lost hope' after being told she was terminally ill say patients have the right not to know their fate.

Vickie Harvey, 24, had fought leukaemia twice - but went rapidly downhill after being told 'in graphic detail' how she was going to die, her parents say.

Eric and Lyn Harvey, from Kidderminster, say they felt powerless and all they could do was comfort their daughter and wait for the inevitable.

Tragic: Vickie Harvey, 24, had fought leukaemia twice - but went rapidly downhill after being told 'in graphic detail' how she was going to die, her parents Lyn and Eric say

They have now launched a campaign to give the dying the right not to know they are terminally ill.

The couple claim their daughter could have lived to see another Christmas had she not been given the prognosis and 'lost all hope'.

'She just gave up on life after that,' said Mr Harvey. 'Vickie came home from hospital and barely got out of bed.

'Me and her mum held her hand and she died barely two weeks later.'

Mr and Mrs Harvey are fighting for the introduction of ‘Vickie’s Wish’, which would allow patients to choose not to be told of a terminal prognosis.

Pledge: 'Vickie's Wish' would allow patients to choose not to be told of a terminal prognosis

Miss Harvey, a self-employed beautician, was first diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia in September 2012.

She underwent a stem cell transplant on Christmas Day at Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital.

The youngest of four children, she was told she was in remission last April.

She celebrated by helping her father organise a surprise 40th wedding anniversary party for her mother.

'She was back to her old self - bubbly and happy,' recalls Mr Harvey. 'We all had a fantastic day and thought life was great.'

But in September, almost a year after she was first diagnosed, the family was given the devastating news that the disease had returned.

'Vickie broke down and sobbed her heart out. But she picked herself up again,' says Mr Harvey, 61.

After weeks of treatment at the Queen Elizabeth, Miss Harvey wanted to be closer to home and was transferred to the Worcester Royal Hospital.

But her father says he lived in fear that doctors there would tell his daughter the truth about her condition.

'The doctors at the QE told us there wasn’t much hope for Vickie’s survival,' he said. 'But Vickie didn’t know that.

'She told us she didn’t want to hear anything negative. She didn’t want to lose hope and that was her wish.'

He added that he and his wife had clashed with one doctor who said she did not agree with keeping information from patients.

'She was of the opinion that Vickie should be told everything so she could prepare herself. But I knew it would devastate her.'

He claimed that Vickie was told of her prognosis in a private examination last November.

Mr Harvey said: 'After [her prognosis] she changed - and never really got out of bed again. We knew she was dying, but we feel that, if she hadn't been told that day, she would have lasted longer'

'It should have only taken a few minutes but she was in there for half an hour,' he said. 'When we eventually went in, Vickie was crying her eyes out.

'She told us the doctor had told her in graphic detail what was going to happen to her.  She was frightened to death.

'After that she changed - and never really got out of bed again. We knew she was dying, but we feel that, if she hadn’t been told that day, she would have lasted longer.

'We would have had one last family Christmas together. That’s what hurts the most.'

Miss Harvey died on December 10. Her parents have since written to Worcester Royal Hospital to complain and they met hospital bosses in February.

They used the meeting to suggest the possibility of introducing a waiver that would allow patients to opt out of being given bad news.

'Such a waiver would have taken the pressure off the medical staff in Vickie’s case,' explained her father.

The couple set up an online petition in support of their waiver idea and it has so far received more than 5,000 signatures.

Mr Harvey said: 'We want to stop other families going through what we did. Someone should have an equal right not to know, as they do to know about their future. That was Vickie’s wish.'

A Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust spokeswoman said: 'We met with Mr and Mrs Harvey to discuss their concerns and are pleased the meeting had a positive outcome.

'We have spoken to the family since and we and they are satisfied the matter has been dealt with appropriately.'

'We want to stop other families going 
through what we did. Someone should have an equal right not to know, as 
they do to know about their future. That was Vickie’s wish,' said parents Eric and Lyn Harvey.

Couple lobbying for 'Vickie's Wish' to be passed. The waiver would mean that terminally ill patients could request not be told about how long they have to live and way in which they die.

Mr and Mrs Harvey say they believe Vickie would have lived longer had she not been told about her death in detail.

Couple say that the doctor went against Vickie's request by telling her how long she had to live because the doctor believed Vickie needed to prepare herself.

British Medical Journal Debate between two palliative care experts asks whether patients should be told about their impending death.

Experts Emily Collis and Katherine Sleeman say YES

Collis and Sleeman say that not communicating the news can affect the trust a patient has in their doctor.

'Patients have the right to make informed decisions about their healthcare,' they write.

They say that information is empowering and allows the patient to put their affairs in order and for relatives to be informed about how they should carry out the deceased's wishes.

A patient aware of their situation is more likely to die at home, they say.

Open discussion helps relieve fears, they argue.

Expert Leslie Blackhall says NO

Prognosis can never be certain, she says.

Telling patients they are terminally ill 'creates more suffering than it relieves'.

'The real thing we need to focus on, if we are going to be truthful with patients, is helping them make decisions. We need to explain what we can do for them,' she said.

Argues that patient should be told trajectory that their treatment will take, what medication will be next, but not how long a person has to live.
