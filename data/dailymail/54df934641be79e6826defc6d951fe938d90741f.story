MPs were last night labelled ‘skivers’ as they announced plans to take an extra five-day holiday in November.

The deal was offered after politicians complained about being recalled twice over the summer recess to discuss phone hacking and riots.

In an attempt to placate them, Commons Leader Sir George Young has proposed they enjoy a five-day ‘mini-break’ next month.

Question time off: MPs have voted to give themselves an extra five-day mini-break in November to compensate for the days lost during the recall of Parliament for the London Riots

Not shirking: Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured today, said this parliament will sit more in its first two years than was the case under the last parliament

But the idea has enraged union 
leaders, who have accused MPs of going ‘on the skive’ at a time when 
families are working hard just to make ends meet.

The row comes after David Cameron promised to cut MPs’ holidays to show he understands public concern about their conduct.

While most workers in the public and 
private sectors get four or  five weeks off annually, this  deal – 
thrashed out in behind-the-scenes talks with all parties – will bring 
the number of Parliamentary recess days this year to 87, excluding 
weekends.

The holiday, which begins on November
15, would replace the break usually given around that time ahead of the
Queen’s Speech, which has been postponed by the coalition until the 
spring.

But the mini-break begins just six 
weeks after MPs have returned from their three-week conference break – 
and is followed by a three-week Christmas holiday only  a month later.

Bob Crow, general secretary  of the 
National Union of Rail,  Maritime and Transport Workers, said: ‘While 
working people are struggling round the clock to make ends meet, the 
same politicians who unleashed the austerity programme have been caught 
out on the skive.

Recalled: MPS were brought back to Parliament during the recess because of the London riots

It looks bad: Labour MP John Mann, left, has criticised the decision saying it risks making his colleague look like 'part-timers' while union boss Bob Crow, right, said it shows MPs are 'on the skive'

Change of plan: The mini-break replaces the holiday traditionally held around the same time, ahead of the Queen's Speech, which has been postponed by the coalition until the spring

In defence: Sir George Young says MPs often conduct constituency business while on holiday

‘We will take no more of the “We are all in this together” rubbish from this crowd.’

A spokesman for Sir George said MPs 
would be sitting for a greater number of days during this Parliament 
than the last one and insisted the mini-break was shorter than those 
given in the past around the Queen’s Speech.

Next year’s summer holiday will also 
be shorter than those in previous years, with MPs returning to 
Westminster in September ahead of party conferences.

The spokesman added: ‘The Government 
is ensuring that the House sits more evenly throughout the year, rather 
than breaking up for an 82-day summer recess as under the previous 
government.

‘As usual, MPs continue to undertake 
important constituency and select committee work, even when the House is
not sitting for the days in question.’

But Emma Boon, of the Taxpayers’ 
Alliance, said: ‘It’s utterly astounding that some members want a 
holiday barely six weeks after returning from their  last recess.

‘This motion makes Parliament look 
incredibly out of touch at a time when many ordinary families don’t have
the time or the money to enjoy a vacation themselves.’

Meanwhile, Commons speaker John 
Bercow revealed that a new security chief could be appointed to protect 
Parliament following the foam pie attack on media mogul Rupert Murdoch 
in July.

He said a review into the incident had found that there was ‘inadequate’ security in the committee room at the time.

Serjeant at Arms Jill Pay, the 
official in charge of security at the Palace of Westminster, last week 
announced that she intends to retire in January.
