A Republican state senator's son was left badly beaten after he confronted two men who were removing a Romney-Ryan sign from outside his home.

Sean Kedzie the son of Wisconsin State Senator Neal Kedzie, was left with multiple bruises over his head and face following the incident outside his house in Whitewater in the early hours of Friday morning.

According to a statement by the State Senator's office the 22-year-old was woken by noises and had gone outside to find a man removing the sign.

Battered: Sean Kedzie was left with multiple bruises over his head and face after confronting a man removing a Ryan Romney sign from outside his home

Mr Kedzie yelled at the individual to return the sign which he did, but at that point a second man attacked him without warning.

He was wrestled to the ground where he 
was held in a chokehold before being battered around the head and face 
by both individuals.

A neighbour, who had heard the commotion, managed to scare the two attackers away and called the police.

Mr Kedzie was taken by ambulance to hospital where he was treated for bruises to his face and was released from the same day.

He is expected to make a full recovery.

The suspects are described as two white males, both about 6 feet tall.

The Whitewater Police Department said the incident is under investigation.

'Shaken': State senator Neal Kedzie

Early on Friday morning, October 19th, my son Sean was awakened by 
noises outside his residence in Whitewater.

As he went to see what the 
commotion was about, he noticed an individual removing a Romney/Ryan 
yard sign from his property.

He yelled to the person that they were 
taking something not theirs and to return it immediately. The individual
 returned the sign, however, a second person confronted and attacked 
Sean without warning.

Sean was wrestled to the ground by both persons, held down by a 
constricting chokehold, and struck repeatedly about the face and head.

He nearly passed out from the chokehold and suffered contusions to his 
face and eyes. Fortunately, an alert neighbor heard the commotion, 
scared the individuals away, and called the police.

My wife and I were 
awakened by a telephone call from Seanâ€™s roommate that Sean had been 
taken by ambulance to Fort Atkinson Memorial Hospital.

Sean was treated for his injuries and released from the hospital the 
same day. As this was a private family matter, we chose not to remark 
publicly about it and allow law enforcement to do their job.

But we 
understand these types of incidents will eventually become public and 
questions will arise, particularly in my position as a state legislator.

Sean is still recovering from the injuries he sustained as a result of 
this beating, and we are confident he will make a full recovery.

But 
obviously, as parents, we are shaken by this event and very troubled it 
was apparently initiated and motivated for political reasons.
