Eddie Lacy scored two touchdowns and rushed 105 yards as he ran the show in Green Bay Packers 42-10 rout over the Minnesota Vikings on Thursday.

Quarterback Aaron Rodgers also added three touchdown passes as the Packers scored the first 42 points in a comfortable victory.

With steady rain falling at Green Bay's Lambeau Field, Rodgers kicked off the fireworks in the first quarter with a scoring throw to Randall Cobb and a 66-yard touchdown pass to Jordy Nelson.

Linebacker Julius Peppers then returned an interception 49 yards for a touchdown in the second quarter before Rodgers added a third touchdown toss to Davante Adams for an 11-yard score.

Lacy, who had yet to reach 50 yards rushing this season, took over in the third, putting the game away with two scoring runs before Green Bay's starters rested in the fourth.

Minnesota, meanwhile, were struggling with third-string quarterback Christian Ponder, who was forced into action when rookie Teddy Bridgewater had been ruled out because of an ankle injury.
