Scared: Tulisa Contostavlos, pictured here at the Academy Awards, called police after men were spotted outside her house

English Defence League boss Tommy Robinson was questioned by police after he was spotted outside the home of Tulisa Contostavlos with a cameraman.

Mr Robinson - real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon - was confronted by police officers and had his car searched after the former X Factor judge dialled 999.

Friends of the star have said she feels 'victimised' by their activities and is still too scared to return to the £6million Hertfordshire home.

However the men, who claim they were filming a documentary, were not arrested, and police decided that no crimes had occurred, the Sunday People reported.

Mr Robinson had used her house as the backdrop for a video six days earlier in a video asking viewers for money.

At the end of the video, he jokingly adds that the money could let the EDL 'buy a house like this', before walking towards it as if to go inside.

The former N-Dubz member reportedly 
tried to ignore the activity but eventually felt compelled to call the 
police once she spotted the men outside her gated home late at night.

A friend of Miss Constostavlos said: 'She's really shaken up - she has no idea why the EDL targeted her.

'She's absolutely not a supporter of the EDL, but she's never said anything publicly about them, so feels pretty victimised.'

Four police cars and a dog unit were called to the house on September 11, while Miss Consostavlos's PA Gareth Varey confronted the men.

A Hertfordshire Police spokesman confirmed that they had been called to the incident.

He said: 'We were called at 10.23pm to reports of suspicious behaviour of two men in a vehicle outside a property.

'Both men were spoken to. As a precaution, we also searched the area. We were satisfied no crimes had occurred.'

Mr Robinson, who tweeted pictures of the officers questioning him and searching his car, later said: 'It was just me and a camera guy who is making a documentary.'

He then said that Mr Varey had 'started piping up cos we was [sic] making a 3 min vid in a lay by outside'.

After the news emerged this morning, Mr Robinson tweeted 'Worst idea I've ever had!'

Some of the video the two men made outside the star's house had been uploaded to Youtube, and shows the EDL leader begging viewers for donations to pay legal fees.

Mr Robinson tells his audience that he desperately needs money to pay a legal bill he said he had already run up trying to challenge police restrictions on one of the EDL's controversial marches.

In a bizarre sign-off at the end of the video, Robinson addressed the camera and jokes: 'Please give us some money - so we can by a house like this.'

He then adds: 'Who lives in a house like this?' before walking towards it as if to go inside.

Miss Contostavlos, who is currently on bail on suspicion of dealing drugs, is said to be staying in north London, in a flat she previously shared with Mr Varey, until she feels safe enough to return to her Hertfordshire home.
