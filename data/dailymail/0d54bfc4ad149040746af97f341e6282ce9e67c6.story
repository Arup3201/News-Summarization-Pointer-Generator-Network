Statins could be used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS) but are being blocked by NHS red tape, a charity has claimed.

The Multiple Sclerosis Society believes cholesterol-busting statins could help treat MS but are not prescribed because of strict NHS rules that prevent drugs being re-licensed for conditions other than that for which they were originally designed.

The disease affects nerves in the brain, eyes and spinal cord, often causing patients to lose basic bodily functions.

Initial trials conducted show that simvastatin, a drug traditionally prescribed to those suffering from heart disease, could slow the breakdown of the tissues in the brain by 40 per cent.

But the drug is not being given to MS sufferers because of laws which prevent old drugs being re-licensed.

The patent for simvastatin expired in 2004 and a new licence would be required to make the drug widely available, the charity has said.

In a letter to today’s Daily Telegraph, the charity described giving old medication a new purpose as ‘a fast and cost effective way’ to provide new treatments.

The MS Society is now asking people to lobby their MP to attend the Off-patent Drugs Bill reading, which will be held in the House of Commons this Friday.

The bill could help tens of thousands MS sufferers currently receiving no effective treatment according to the MS Society.

The letter to the newspaper has been signed by half a dozen medical experts including five neurologists.

Michelle Mitchell, the charity’s chief executive, said that denying patients from receiving the medication was ‘nonsensical’ and called for MPs to ‘cut the red tape’.

She said: ‘In progressive MS, symptoms gradually worsen and there are currently no medicines that can slow or stop the accumulation of disability.

‘This can leave people desperate and willing to try anything and we know some even consider unproven therapies or interventions which might be expensive and dangerous.

‘In the example of simvastatin, if phase 3 trials are successful, it would be cruel to tell people we have finally found a drug that might slow the progression of their MS but they cannot have it.’
