Michael Schumacher's son Mick showed racing skill runs in the family as he secured a podium finish in the German Kart Championship. 

The 15-year-old came second behind rival David Beckmann in the competition's finale in Genk, Belgium. 

He was also runner-up in the World Junior Championship in France last month.

Mick's promised this is 'only the beginning of his racing career' and success on the track comes as his 45-year-old father recovers from a life-threatening skiing accident last December.

The seven-time Formula One world champion suffered serious head injuries and spent six months in a coma after his crash in the French Alps. 

Mick said: 'Of course I am proud of such an important result. But it is also clear that it is my goal to be world champion. This is only the beginning of my career.'

Karting was where it all began for Michael Schumacher and he couldn't resist jumping in again 

Michael had a similar start to his legendary racing career - starting to race at a young age after his father built him his first kart when he was just four years old

The racing legend won the German Kart Champion title aged 15 and went on to break numerous records on his way to claiming seven world titles and staking his claim to be one of the sport's most successful drivers ever. 

The German won back-to-back titles with Benetton in the mid-nineties before winning five successive championships with Ferrari to cement his place in history.
