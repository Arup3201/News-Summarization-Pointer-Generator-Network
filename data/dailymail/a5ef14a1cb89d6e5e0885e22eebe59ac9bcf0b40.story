A US space firm is trying to raise £660,000 via crowdfunding site Kickstarter for a private space telescope that could scour asteroids looking for precious metals to mine.

Planetary Resources wants to build and use satellite telescopes to hunt for asteroids orbiting Earth before using robotic spacecrafts to mine the asteroids for precious metals, water and other materials.

The company has already received backing from Google's founders - but is now asking for members of the public to donate to the project and get involved in hunting for suitable asteroids.

Anyone who donates to the ARKYD Kickstarter campaign can use the telescope as a 'space photo booth' to send digital photos to the telescope and have them displayed on the side. A remote camera will then be able to take a photo of the image, with the telescope and Earth in the background, and transmit the image back to the sender

Weight: 15kg

Height: 200mm

Height when fully deployed: 425mm

Wingspan: 600mm

Other specifications:

Resolving capability: ~ 1 arcsecond

Wavelength range: 200 nm to 1100 nm

5 MP+ image sensor

Active image stabilization

Planetary Resources also hopes to launch an educational and outreach program to let students, museums, armchair astronomers and virtual travellers share use of a telescope.

Using Kickstarter, a website used to raise funds for creative projects, Planetary Resources aims to raise £660,000 ($1million) by 30 June.

If there is enough public support, Planetary Resources plans to launch its first telescope, called the ARKYD by 2015.

ARKYD is based on Arakyd Industries - a driod manufacturer in Star Wars.

Anyone who pledges £16.50 ($25) can use the telescope as a 'space photo booth'.

Anyone who pledges to Planetary Resources' telescope campaign and submits a digital photo can order Christmas cards and other merchandise with the image on

People who pledge to the ARKYD campaign on Kickstarter can also order Independence and wedding cards

This involves sending a picture to 
the telescope, which is then displayed on the side of it like a 
billboard with Earth in the background. 

A
remote camera will then take a photo of the image, with the space in 
the background, and transmit the image back to the sender.

People who makes pledges of at least £29 ($45) can ordered their photos on merchandise including t-shirts and greetings cards.

Packs include Christmas, Independence and Wedding.

Anyone who donates also gets a pledge certificate with their photo as a keepsake.

Additionally, anyone who pledges at least £132 ($200) will be allowed to use the telescope to hunt for astronomical objects.

Planetary Resources want to use the space telescope to explore the universe and hunt for asteroids. It hopes to get images like those pictured. Planetary Resources will then use a robotic spacecraft to mine any asteroids it finds for precious materials. Anyone who pledges £132 ($200) can also use the orbiting telescope for their own personal hunting missions

Investors already include Google 
Chief Executive Larry Page and Chairman Eric Schmidt, as well as Ross 
Perot Jr., chairman of the real estate development firm Hillwood and The
Perot Group.

'All we are 
asking is for the public to tell us that they want something,' company 
co-founder Eric Anderson told reporters during a webcast press 
conference on Wednesday.

'We're
not going to spend our time and resources to do something if people 
don't want it and really the only way to prove that it's something 
people want is to ask them for money,' he said.

Planetary Resources is not the first space startup to turn to crowdfunding.

An infographic created by Planetary Resources shows that the ARKYD will weigh 15kg, have a wingspan of 6cm when its deployed and its named was inspired by Arakyd Industries - a droid manufacturer in Star Wars

The ARKYD telescope orbits at five miles per second and can capture images from 300-450 miles above the Earth. It is not affected by daylight or clouds so can capture clear images

Colorado-based Golden Spike, which 
plans commercial human expeditions to the moon, has launched two 
initiatives on Indiegogo, another online funding platform.

Golden
Spike raised £49,000 ($75,000) to start a sister firm, called Uwingu, 
designed to funnel profits into space projects, but couldn't raise the 
£158,000 ($240,000) for spacesuits for Golden Spike's first moon run.

Hyper-V Technologies of Virginia used to Kickstarter to raise nearly £48,000 ($73,000).

Planetary Resources is hoping to raise £660,000 ($1million) to fund its plans for the asteroid-hunting space telescope. As an incentive, the Washington-based company is offering different rewards for the amount of money pledged. People who pledge £6598 ($10,000) will have an asteroid named after them

It used the money to help develop a plasma jet electric thruster.

Last year, Washington-based LiftPort 
ended an £5,200 ($8,000) Kickstarter campaign with more than £659,900 
($100,000) to demonstrate how robots could climb a 1.2-mile long tether 
above a large helium balloon.

The
company is working on an alternative space transportation system called
a 'space elevator' that uses tethers or cables instead of rockets.

Engineers at Planetary Resources have already built a prototype of the ARKYD telescope. It weighs 15KG and is 42.5cm tall. The built-in 5MP cameras will work at night and can capture images while it travels at around 5mph 

'Golden Spike founder and planetary scientist Alan Stern told Reuters: 'I
think crowd-funding is a new kind of bike and people are trying and 
willing to ride it, some successfully, some not as successfully, but I 
think it's here to stay,' .

'These
companies like Kickstarter and Indiegogo and RocketHub, they seem to be
some kind of marketing distribution system that lets people with an 
idea put it out there.

'Previously
people didn't know how to do that except run an ad in a newspaper. It's
a capability we just didn't have five years ago.'
