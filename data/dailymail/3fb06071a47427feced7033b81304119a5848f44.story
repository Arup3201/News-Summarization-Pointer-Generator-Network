She was applying for a job in the mines but that didn’t stop Kasey Davis being turned down because of the way she looks.

The 28-year-old tattoo lover, who has adorned her body with colourful inkings, was rejected from a cleaning and kitchen hand role at a mining site by a job agency after being told her tattoos were ‘a deal breaker’.

Kasey runs a local tattoo studio with her equally inked husband Nifty, in the small city of Emerald in the Central Highlands Region of Queensland.

Posting on their studio, Artworx 4720, Facebook page Kasey said she was told by a recruitment agent that tattoos ‘might be an issue with the site manager’.

She was then asked to send photos of herself along with her most current resume.

‘By now I was really confused but really wanted the job so I was willing to do that. I took a normal photo then I took a photo in a collared, long sleeve high-vis work shirt,’ Kasey said.

She sent the pictures and said she hoped that ‘my tattoos and my appearance do not detract from my skills and abilities’.

The agency replied: ‘I think you would be great for the job, but the tattoos are a deal breaker.’

Kasey was ‘devastated’ by the news and the fact her appearance was the reason she did not get the job.

‘I never want anyone to feel the way I did and still do and will for a long time. We want to open people’s eyes and let everyone know that even though we have tattoos that doesn't make us any different,’ she said.

Her husband Nifty supported her for speaking out on their Facbook page, despite a social media backlash.

He said: ‘I am standing by my wife, whether we own a studio or not I believe we all have a right to look the way we do.

‘Kasey wasn't going for a job where how she looks should be an issue. She only applied for this mine site cleaning job because they never mentioned tattoos are unacceptable.

‘We understand not everyone likes the way we appear, and they have every right to their opinion. But please don't take into account our image over our capabilities.’
