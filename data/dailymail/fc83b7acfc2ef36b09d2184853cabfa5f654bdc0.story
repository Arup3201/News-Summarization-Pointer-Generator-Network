Jailed: Barman Charles Franklin has been convicted of rape after attacking a woman when she was walking home from a wedding drunk

A barman was today jailed for nine years after raping a woman on the floor of the pub where he worked when she was returning home from attending a wedding.

Charles Franklin approached his victim in the street when she was almost 'paralytic' then took her to his pub and attacked her, a court heard.

He claimed they had consensual sex - but the 30-year-old woman, who is a lesbian, said that he told her he would 'break her neck' if she struggled.

The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, could not remember leaving the wedding in Bristol where she had been a guest and her first memory was waking up while being raped.

Franklin, 30, denied the charges of rape and attempted rape, but was convicted and sentenced to nine years in prison following a trial at Bristol Crown Court.

Sentencing, Judge Michael Roach said: 'It's easy to have a picture of girl in desperation, trying to escape. You have blighted her life.

'From witnesses we heard during your trial it was made clear that you are a man of good character but on the night in question you put that woman through a terrifying situation.

'The sentence I am about to hand you should be in double figures, but your good character has reduced it to just under that.'

During the trial, the court heard how the woman left the wedding party in November 2012 at 1am after 'a lot of drinking'.

She could not remember leaving, but it later emerged that by 3.45am she had alcohol in her system equivalent to three times the drink-drive limit.

'The next thing I remember was being on the floor of this pub with a guy,' she said. 'He stripped me. He was trying to force himself on me. I was struggling quite a lot. He told me if I kept struggling he would break my neck, so I let him do what he wanted.'

Attack: Franklin invited his victim to the Somerset House pub in the Clifton area of Bristol and raped her there

Franklin claimed he met the woman in the street, offered to charge her phone at The Somerset House pub in Clifton, and 'one thing led to another' on the floor.

After the attack the man sat at the bar and watched TV while his victim lay naked on the floor, she claimed.

'I managed to find my coat and I pretended to be asleep so he wouldn't come back,' she said. 'I looked around to see where the doors were. I decided to get up to see if there was a toilet or a window.'

She could not find a way out and the pair went upstairs to a bedroom where the man tried, but failed, to have sex with her again before falling asleep.

The victim then put on Franklin's jeans and T-shirt before climbing out of a window. She went to a kebab van and borrowed a mobile phone to raise the alarm with her mother, who came to pick her up.

Denial: Franklin pleaded not guilty and insisted that he had consensual sex with the woman

Police later found Franklin's wallet in the pocket of his trousers and tracked him down to the pub, where he was still asleep at 9am.

Tara Wolfe, prosecuting, said: 'The attack had devastating consequences on the victim's life. She was forced to take medication after the attack and as a result she was unable to pursue her career for 12 weeks.'

Edward Burgess, mitigating, said: 'Mr Franklin is a man of good character, as you heard from several witnesses in the trial, and prior to this he has no previous convictions.

'Since the night in question Mr Franklin has struck up a new relationship and as you will see now, and did throughout the trial, she is visibly distressed by the accusations which she finds hard to believe.

'This is not a case which cries out with features of heavy violence.'

Franklin, from Withywood in Bristol, was also ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' Register.
