Australian property seekers will be given a chance to live beside a piece of history when the childhood home of Ned Kelly goes up for auction next month.

The infamous bushranger's now heritage listed cottage in Beveridge south of Melbourne where he grew up with seven siblings, has been kept in its original condition, according to the estate's agent Andrew Bellino from Ray White.

It remains unchanged since 1859 when Kelly's father built it a few years after his son was born, using the land to graze his dairy cattle.

Mr Bellino told Daily Mail Australia that due to the property's unique historical value, no starting price had been set for the auction day and they were 'leaving it up to the market to determine the value'.

Ned Kelly's first childhood home in Beveridge south of Melbourne, was placed on the market on Friday and is set to be auctioned off on September 20

Built in 1859 by Ned's father John 'Red' Kelly, the Irish style cottage is heritage listed and remains in its original condition

Buyers will also be the owners of a federation-style residence only 207 metres from the Kelly house

John 'Red' Kelly built his family’s first home using materials he could scavenge from the bush, including local bluestone for the endearing chimney.

Complete with an earthen floor and drainage running between the two rooms, Kelly's home was built as a typical Irish style wooden cottage, according to the Property Observer.

But buyers won't be forced to live in the previous millennium if they secure the historic purchase.

Set on a 3.5 acre block of land, the property also includes a federation-style home, only 207 metres from the heritage listed cottage.

The Beveridge property did not remain the Kelly family’s residence for long however, with the family moving on not long after Red’s death in 1866 when they moved to Eleven Mile Creek.

It was not long after that Ned Kelly’s first run in with the law occurred, leading to a whole range of jail sentences that eventually saw him shot down in his iconic armour at the Glenrowan siege.

The property at 44 Kelly Street Beveridge will go up for auction on September 20.
