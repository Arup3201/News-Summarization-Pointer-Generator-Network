There was no time for monkeying around when this abused pigtail macaque was found tied to a tree with a badly broken hip.

But the stricken animal should be up and swinging again in no time after he was fitted with a plaster cast.

The primate is thought to have been beaten with a stick and was found tethered to a tree in Thailand using a metal chain.

Recovering: Bo, an abused pigtail macaque, has been fitted with a plaster cast after being beaten

Stricken: The primate suffered a badly broken hip and is thought to have been beaten by a stick

Abandoned: Bo was found tethered to a tree in Phetchaburi, central Thailand, using a metal chain

Vulnerable: The monkey was unable to protect itself from other animals while it was tied to the tree

But the injured animal - named Bo - is now back on his feet and is expected to make a full recovery in three to four weeks.

The monkey was found to have suffered a clean fracture after being taken to a veterinary surgery.

The Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand had rescued Bo after being alerted on Tuesday by a member of the public in Phetchaburi, in the central region of the country.

The metal fastener attached to the chain had to be cut from Bo's leg before he could be free and his jagged teeth had been worn down from where he tried to gnaw through it.

Pigtail macaques are found across Thailand, as well as Cambodia, China, Vietnam, Bangladesh and India.

Helping hands: Bo was taken to a vets where he was given an x-ray, right, and treated for the fracture, left

Abuse: Bo's jagged teeth show signs of how he tried to gnaw his way free from the chain

Care: Bo was taken to the vets by Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand which had been alerted by the public

They prefer to live in dense rainforest, although the continued loss of such habitats poses a threat to the species.

The animals are also popular for scientific research and testing in laboratories and are considered a pest by many because they are known to eat crops.

The macaque has been placed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of threatened species since 2004.

The primates are omnivorous and eat a wide variety of food, from insects and fungus to leaves and seeds, but around two thirds of their diet is made up of fruit.

Macaques can live for around 25 years, growing up to two feet tall and weight more than two stone.

In danger: Macaques have been on the IUCN's Red List of threatened species since 2004

Trapped: The metal fastener which was attached to the macaque's leg and had to be cut off

Getting better: Vets believe Bo will have made a full recovery in two to three week
