A college student's murder remains unsolved a month after her death as her family revealed their fears over her roommate's allegedly violent ex-boyfriend.

Faith Hedgepeth, a member of the Haliwa-Saponi tribe of Hollister, North Carolina, was found dead by friends at her apartment on September 7.

Police have confirmed that they are treating the 19-year-old's death as a homicide and do not believe it was a random act.

There have been few developments in the investigation and police will not say whether they are questioning a suspect or if any arrests have been made.

Miss Hedgepeth's father Roland told the Charlotte Observer he was concerned about her roommate's ex-boyfriend although police refused to comment on these allegations to MailOnline.

Faith had won a scholarship to study biology to UNC Chapel Hill and planned on becoming a doctor.

However she fell behind in her studies and dropped out in her sophomore year, losing financial aid.

She worked as a waitress, living off-campus and went back to college this summer, changing her major and focusing on becoming an elementary school teacher.

She shared an apartment with a fellow student Karena Rosario, originally from New Jersey. Miss Rosario had a boyfriend, 21-year-old Takoy Jones but the relationship fell apart.

The two young women were forced to change the locks after Jones reportedly kicked their doors in.  Miss Rosario also took a restaining order out against her former boyfriend.

At the time of Miss Hedgepeth's murder, Mr Jones, told ABC that she was the ‘sweetest person in the world' and that whoever killed her 'deserves to burn'.

Victim: Faith Hedgepeth, a UNC student and a member of the Haliwa-Saponi tribe of Hollister, North Carolina, was found dead in her home on September 7

Murdered: Police have not revealed how Hedgepeth, right, was killed or whether they have made any arrests in connection with her murder

Her father Roland Hedgepeth told the Charlotte Observer: 'From day one, I’ve been worried about Faith there. I’m looking at and questioning every scenario.'

Authorities have refused to elaborate
on how the student was killed
in her home, which is three miles from the main UNC campus.

Emergency crews referred to blood at the scene but carpet and walls had been stripped for forensic testing.

In
an email alert to the UNC community last month, chancellor Holden Thorp said: 'I 
am sorry to let you know of the sudden death of one of our students... 
law enforcement officials do not believe that there is danger to other 
students, faculty or staff. '

Former roommate: Takoy Jones, 21, had once lived at the apartment with his ex-girlfriend Karena Rosario before Miss Hedgepeth died

The Haliwa-Saponi tribe is the third-largest Native American tribe in North Carolina.

Comprised of 3,800 people, the tribe is a close-knit rural community who live within a 10-mile radius on the Halifax County/Warren County line. The tribe received state recognition in 1965 and is in the process of seeking full federal recognition.

Members are the descendants of three tribes who inhabited the area prior to European settlement and conflict. Members originally called themselves Indians but began using the Haliwa name in the 1950s.

In 1979, Saponi was added to the name in recognition of an ancient tribe from which many are descended.  Life largely revolves around the Protestant religion.The tribe is governed by an elected eleven-member Council, including an elected Chief and Vice-Chief.

In 2000, the tribe opened a new school for its members.

More than 1,000 people from the Haliwa-Saponi tribe gathered to grieve Hedgepeth’s death during the tribe’s annual powwow in September.

According to her friends, Hedgepeth planned to return to live with the Native American tribe, which has about 4,000 members, after she finished her studies.

Rolanda Hedgepeth told the Charlotte Observer that her sister loved her ancestry and her church.

Her church’s pastor, Willie Pastor, said: 'You send a child off to college and you think they will be safe. This throws your whole balance in life off.'

Friends say that Hedgepeth wanted to be a paediatrician or a teacher and described the teenager as ‘the sweetest person ever.'

Hedgepeth's murder is the second at UNC in four years.

In
2008, student president Eve Carson was kidnapped from her home and 
taken to a series of ATMs to withdraw money before being murdered.

One killer pleaded guilty to Carson's murder and another was found guilty earlier this year.
