At least six people have been killed in an early morning suicide attack in the Afghan capital, hours after a surprise visit to Afghanistan by President Barack Obama, government officials said.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack and said it was a response to Mr Obama's visit.

A series of explosions and gunfire rang out in eastern Kabul at around 6am near a private armed compound that houses hundreds of international workers.

Blaze: Afghan Firefighters extinguish a burning car at the site of the suicide bomb attack in Kabul.

Smoke: Security personnel urge onlookers away after the attack.

Shooting continued for hours and it 
was not clear later whether the attack had ended, as another large 
explosion sounded around 8am from inside the complex, known as Green 
Village.

An Afghan police official said two suicide attackers were still inside Green Village and were 'resisting'.

One of the first blasts was a suicide 
car bomb that exploded near Jalalabad Road, one of the main routes out 
of the city, said Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqi.

A station wagon that was driving past was caught up in the explosion and four people inside were killed, Mr Sediqi said.

Attacked: An explosion killed six people in Kabul today, just hours after President Obama visited Bagram Air Field in Afghanistan

Greetings: Mr Obama was there to mark the first anniversary of Osama bin Laden's death as well as meet with Afghan President Hamid Karza

A passer-by and a security guard for a nearby building also were killed.

The explosions happened hours after Mr
 Obama left Afghanistan after a quick visit to mark the first 
anniversary of Osama bin Laden's death.

He spoke to troops and signed a pact with Afghan President Hamid Karzai to govern the US presence in Afghanistan until 2024.

'I'm here to affirm the bond between 
our two countries and to thank Americans and Afghans who have sacrificed
 so much over these last ten years,' said Mr Obama.

'Neither Americans nor the Afghan people asked for this war yet for a decade we've stood together.'

The agreement with Karzai covers how 
the U.S. will be involved with security, economics and governance after 
the unpopular war is brought to an end.

As he battles for re-election, Obama 
is seeking to portray his foreign policy record, including the killing 
of bin Laden, as a success - yet it has also come under scrutiny.

Serving and former US Navy SEALs 
slammed the president for taking the credit for killing bin Laden and 
accused him of using Special Forces operators as ‘ammunition’ for his 
re-election campaign.

Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid 
claimed responsibility for the attack and said it was planned as a 
response to Mr Obama's trip.

Anniversary: The President's visit marked the first anniversary of the killing of Osama Bin Laden

'This is a reaction to Obama's visit 
to Afghanistan,' Mr Mujahid said, without elaborating. He said the 
target was a 'foreign military base'.

Nato forces spokesman Captain Justin Brockhoff said there were no indications that any Nato bases were under attack.

The Green Village complex, with its 
towering blast walls and heavily armed security force, is similar 
in appearance to Nato bases in the city.

A reporter at the scene saw a group of
 Afghan soldiers enter the Green Village compound, after which heavy 
shooting could be heard coming from inside.

Outside the complex, men could be seen
 carrying a wounded man covered with blood, apparently pulled out of the
 flames engulfing a nearby car.

'These people evacuated a man from the
 burning car, two bodies are laying there now and three or four other 
victims were evacuated from the school,' said Ahmad Zia, a resident who 
saw the explosion.

Green Village was also the target of 
anti-foreigner protests following the burning of Korans at a US base in 
February. At that time, violent protests raged outside, but the angry 
crowds did not breach the compound's defences.
