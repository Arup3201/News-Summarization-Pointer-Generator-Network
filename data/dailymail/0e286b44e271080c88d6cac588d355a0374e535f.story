A rescue horse could be the world's oldest after celebrating her 49th birthday - and she still enjoys a gallop despite being almost completely blind.

Orchid the Arab-Thoroughbred cross is more than double the age of most of her stable mates - but still enjoys a good gallop and roll in her field.

And despite being completely emaciated when she arrived at the Remus horse sanctuary in Brentwood, Essex, after being rescued two years ago, she had undergone a complete transformation.

When Orchid, pictured with stable hand Laura Barnes, arrived at the Remus sanctuary in Brentwood, Essex, two years ago, she was completely emaciated

She stunned vets not only with her incredible recovery - but also when they realised she was almost half a century old.

Sue Burton, founder of the sanctuary, said: 'When Orchid was originally found she was laying on the floor, emaciated and full of sores and had given up. 

'To see her today running, bucking and rolling is so heart-warming.

'She's almost totally blind but it doesn't seem to bother her too much. She's a very happy horse nowadays, full of energy and has a great attitude.

'Orchid knows her own mind which is great to see for a horse of her age. Every morning when we go down to the stables, she will bang on the door waiting for her breakfast and doesn't stop until we give her what she wants.'

Rescuers knew that Orchid was an old mare, but equine dental specialists revealed that Orchid is 48 years old - while the average horse's life span is between 25 and 30 years.

Staff celebrated her birthday on New Year's Day, as she has no official equine passport - because she was born before they became obligitary in 1998. 

And although she may be going grey and almost completely blind, she still enjoys a good roll in a field

Orchid has a carrot-free diet but goes through four to five cabbages a week or more than 200 throughout the course of the year.

Ms Burton added: 'I'd say that her lifestyle in retirement is the secret to her old age. She's a very relaxed horse and lives a very stress-free life. 

'She's also really determined and shows tremendous grit.

'We don't work our oldest horses. Orchid's day consists of waking up, having breakfast and then we leave her to do as she pleases in the paddock until dinner time. 

'She's certainly enjoying her retirement. Horses are living much longer nowadays. 

'When I first set up this sanctuary 31 years ago, 15 was a good age for a horse but now it's normal for them to live to the age of 30.

'There's been so many veterinary advancements in the past few years that we're a lot better equipped to treat the animals but it's also a matter of lifestyle. 

'Orchid's very happy and relaxed. We think that's why she's lived to such a good age.'

The previous record holder, Shayne, a 51-year-old liver chestnut Irish Draught cross thoroughbred, died in September last year.
