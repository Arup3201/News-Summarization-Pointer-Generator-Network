Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti expects Basle to progress in the Champions League at Liverpool's expense - because they are a fitter side.

The defending champions, who had already qualified for the last 16, earned a hard-fought 1-0 victory against Basle at St Jakob-Park on Wednesday to cement their place at the top of Group B on 15 points.

Liverpool, meanwhile, were pegged back by Ludogorets in Bulgaria, succumbing to a 2-2 after the home side grabbed an 88th-minute equaliser through Georgi Terziev.

That leaves the Reds in third-place, level on four points with Ludogorets, and two behind Basle - who they must beat in their final group match at Anfield in order to progress.

But Real boss Ancelotti does not believe Brendan Rodgers' side are fit enough to beat the Swiss champions and expects to see Basle in the last-16 draw.

Speaking after the win, he said: 'They're (Basle are) in better shape than Liverpool at the moment, they are in very good physical condition.

'At this moment Basle have a slight advantage.'

'They caused us some problems in the second part. We fought hard and that's why we won.'

Goals from Rickie Lambert and Jordan Henderson had appeared to give Liverpool - who fell behind early to a Dani Abalo strike - victory at the Ludogorets Arena, only for Terziev to pop up with the goal which ensures they must now secure three points from their final league goal.

However, in Basle Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 71st Champions League goal to move joint-second in the all-time scoring list alongside Real legend Raul, and three behind Barcelona's Lionel Messi.
