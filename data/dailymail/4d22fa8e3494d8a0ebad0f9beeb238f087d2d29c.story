Last Easter weekend there wasn’t room to swing a towel on Bournemouth beach as thousands of sun-seekers soaked up a glorious heatwave.

Yesterday, however, towels would have come in handy for the odd dog-walker who braved the heavy downpours that soaked the beach under a grim, grey sky.

Beaches were deserted at other resorts up and down the country as families stayed indoors, possibly wearing a jumper or two.

Last Easter was the hottest for more than 60 years when the mercury approached 26C (80F), making some places hotter than Malaga and Athens.

Those scenes were a distant memory yesterday, as were the T-shirts and shorts that many wore just last week during the fine weather.

Chilly winds knocked temperatures down to a nippy 9C (48F) in Bournemouth and heavy rain soaked the last day of the long weekend for visiting holidaymakers.

On the seafront, cafes were crammed 
with people desperate to keep out of the cold, and sales of hot drinks 
were brisk compared to the recent hot spell.

Sandra Brook, 42, visiting 
Bournemouth with husband Mark, 43, and sons Harry, six, and Jacob, nine,
summed up a nation’s frustration with the cursed bank holiday weather: 
‘It’s another bank holiday washout.

‘We
were determined to have a nice family day no matter what the weather, 
so we decided to come along to the beach and have fun splashing about in
the puddles.

‘Last week’s 
sun was fantastic and I thought we would be set for summer but this bank
holiday has brought me back to reality. I hope it doesn’t continue like
this.’

Unfortunately, it 
looks like it will. Forecasters say the wet weather which turned the 
Easter weekend into a damp squib will continue for the rest of the week 
and into next weekend too.

The Met Office said some areas may even see overnight frost as well as thunderstorms.

And temperatures of 12C (54F) to 14C (57F) will make the return to work all the more mundane.

Met Office forecaster George Goodfellow said: ‘It looks like showers for the rest of the week.

‘It
will be unsettled all over the country going into the weekend, with 
some places experiencing heavy showers and thunderstorms.

‘Things
might calm down towards the end of the weekend but temperatures will 
remain low, especially at night where people could see frost forming.

He added: ‘The rainfall and temperatures are pretty much average for April, though.’

Making the most of it: Families across Britain put up with an overcast holiday weekend. It was a damp and drizzly Easter Sunday for James McGinley, aged 4, who was his sheltered by mum Belinda in Saltburn, north Yorkshire
