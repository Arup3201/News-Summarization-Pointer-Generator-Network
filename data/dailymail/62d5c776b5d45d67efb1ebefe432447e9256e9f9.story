President Obama's proposed $60.4 billion federal aid for victims of Hurricane Sandy has been revealed stuffed with millions in spending for museums and NASA with portions sent as far from the Northeast’s destruction as Alaska.

Now dubbed the 'Sandy scam' by its critics, only a portion of the federal funding goes directly to states and victims hardest hit by superstorm Sandy in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut.

Instead $150 million is slated to benefit Alaskan fisheries, $8 million to homeland security and the justice departments for new cars, office equipment, furniture and 'mobile X-Ray machines,' and $41 million for eight military bases including Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, the New York Post reports.

A whopping $13 
billion will go to preventing future storm damage, including soil erosion 
and tree planting said to 'help reduce flood effects, protect water sources, decrease soil erosion and 
improve wildlife habitat.'

Preparation against future storms:$13 billion to 'mitigation' projects that prepare for future storms

VA Manhattan Medical Center$207 million

Alaskan fisheries through NOAA:$150 million

Military bases: Eight along the storm’s path, including Guantanamo Bay, Cuba$41 million

Homeland Security and Justice departments for vehicles and equipment:$8 million

Kennedy Space Center, Florida:$4 million to repair sand berms and dunes

Plum Island Animal Disease Center, New York:$3.3 million

Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.:$2 million to repair museum roofs

National cemeteries:$1.1 million for repairs

Other slices of the pie will provide $4 million 
to Florida's Kennedy Space Center and $2 million to Washington D.C.'s 
Smithsonian Institution for museum roof repairs - damaged reported prior to the late-October storm.

Other beneficiaries include $207 million for the VA Manhattan Medical Center, $3.3 million for the Plum Island Animal Disease Center in New York, and $1.1 million for national cemeteries.

In all, $47.4 billion is said to go directly to Sandy victims and their rebuilding efforts, reports Fox News.

Released on the heels of the looming 
‘Fiscal Cliff,’ the extravagant spending has been 
described as nothing but pork by many critics  as politicians continue to grapple to reduce an 
exceeding $16 trillion national debt.

'The funding here should be focused on helping the community and the people, not replacing federal assets or federal items,' Matt Mayer of the conservative Heritage Foundation reacted to the Post over the hurricane aid.

Others have criticized the package’s number as unnecessarily rushed, with FEMA currently stocked with $5 billion in disaster relief funds set to last until March.

'To throw out a number this large without in-depth analysis and formal request detailing the basis for it I think is premature and I wouldn’t support that,' Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions from Alaska told the Post.

In contrast, senators in the northeast praised the package at the time of its announcement, though some voiced it being perhaps not large enough.

'This supplemental is a very good start, and while $60 billion doesn't cover all of New York and New Jersey's needs, it covers a large percentage,' said Democratic Senators Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Frank Lautenberg and Robert Menendez of New Jersey.

Governors Chris Christie (R-NJ), Andrew Cuomo (D-NY) and Dannel Malloy (D-CT) previously pressed for a package of $80 billion.

The proposed package will require passage by congress before implemented with it expected to be addressed in the Senate on Monday according to House Homeland Security Chairman Peter King.
