'We are so in love with this amazing little man who has brought such joy into our lives. 

'There are so many wonderful and interesting things I am documenting, the power of love, the agonising wait (and then elation) of adoption, the welcoming of another life into our clan, and what it means to be a biracial family.'

The 37-year-old photographer's last series proved a great success, she captured heart-warming photos of her daughters growing up, called Strong Is The New Pretty.
