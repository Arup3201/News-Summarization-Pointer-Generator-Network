At first glance, they appear to have little in common.

But, thanks to Dutch inventor Jasper van Loenden, a keyboard, a bicycle wheel and a telephone can now be turned into flying unmanned vehicles - along with just about any other everyday item.

His 'Drone it Yourself' kit can make more or less anything take flight.

A bicycle wheel is turned into a drone by Dutch inventor Jasper van Loenen's, whose Drone It Yourself kit turns more or less anything light enough into a flying machine

Other items like a phone or keyboard have also taken to the skies thanks to the kit

A keyboard is wired up and propellers attached to its four corners ahead of lift-off

Next to be wired up is a phone, which took to the skies without a problem

The kit includes 3D-printed plastic clamps, four motors, a receiver-equipped control unit, four electronic speed controllers, a Bluetooth module and an OpenPilot CC3D flight controller.

Once the clamps and propellers are attached and the wires are connected, the machine is created.

It is not for sale yet, but the creator has has made the printer files available, so anyone can make them.

The brains of the system run on an OpenPilot flight controller, making the entire kit, from soup to nuts, completely open source and therefore free.

There’s also no soldering or heavy machinery involved in creating the components for the kit — so it requires no technical know-how to execute. The kit itself simply clamps on to any object with a simple vice mechanism.

While Van Loenen doesn’t give any weight stipulations, it is safe to say if the drone cannot achieve liftoff, a lighter object is needed.

Drones are deployed predominantly for military and special operation applications, but are also used in a small but growing number of civil applications, such as policing and firefighting.

Earlier this week the Navy successfully landed a drone the size of a fighter jet aboard an aircraft carrier for the first time, showing the military's capability to have a computer program perform one of the most difficult tasks a pilot is asked to do.

The landing of the X-47B experimental aircraft means the Navy can move forward with its plans to develop another unmanned aircraft that will join the fleet alongside traditional airplanes to provide around-the-clock surveillance while also possessing a strike capability.

It also would pave the way for the U.S. to launch unmanned aircraft without the need to obtain permission from other countries to use their bases.
