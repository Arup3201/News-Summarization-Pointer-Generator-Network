A crime tsar compared to David Brent has attempted to defend herself after police officers branded her a 'laughing stock' following an 'embarrassing' Channel 4 documentary about her job.

Viewers reacted with fury to last night's Meet The Police Commissioner programme in which Ann Barnes, elected crime chief for Kent, struggled to explain her £85,000-a-year taxpayer-funded role.

Mrs Barnes today tried to calm anger over the fly-on-the-wall show, claiming the programme placed 'too much emphasis' on her.

Ann Barnes is facing mounting criticism of her £85,000-a-year role as Kent police commissioner after a 'car crash' TV documentary, which showed her travelling around the county in her 'Ann Force 1' van

Mrs Barnes was compared to Ricky Gervais's desperate character David Brent after she was filmed struggling to explain her publicly-funded job with Kent Police

The documentary showed Mrs Barnes travelling in a van she dubs 'Ann Force 1', having difficulty explaining an approach to policing priorities called 'the onion' and bringing her dogs into the office.

She also failed to write her title correctly on a whiteboard, was filmed painting her 'flaky' nails and compared the force to a tin of paint that she wanted to 'prise' open.

Ian 
Pointon, chairman of the Kent Police Federation, which represents 
rank-and-file officers, told BBC Radio Kent: 'I think it was probably a 
disaster from start to finish, in fairness.

'It
 was an ill-advised concept and from within Kent Police I know that Mrs 
Barnes was advised not to do it. It was never going to end well.

'I
 think, sadly, it has turned Kent Police by association into something 
of a laughing stock. Social media was alight with comments.'

Viewers took to Twitter during and after the hour-long programme to say ex-teacher Mrs Barnes was an 'embarrassment' to Kent Police.

Viewers attacked Mrs Barnes on Twitter, comparing her to comedy characters David Brent and Alan Partridge

Website 
users compared her to Ricky Gervais' character from The Office, David Brent, with one commenting that the show was 'depressingly hilarious, hilariously depressing'.

One viewer
 tweeted: 'What an embarrassment Ann Barnes, PCC for Kent Police, is. 
Anybody watching this car crash TV? I'm not sure if this is a joke or 
not.'

Another said: 'Ann Barnes was like Kent's very own David Brent. A total embarrassment and waste of taxpayers' money.'

The show was seen as a damning indictment of the elected roles, with 88 per cent of the more than 1,000 people who voted in a poll on local news website KentOnline saying they didn't think the Commissioner did a good job.

This afternoon, a banner reading '#annbarnesout - resign' was flown over Maidstone, Kent where Mrs Barnes works.

A plane towing the banner, whose pilot refused to say to paid for the sign, circled Kent Police HQ for around a quarter of an hour shortly after midday today.

Mrs Barnes was branded a 'laughing stock' by a police officers, who said the programme was a 'disaster'

After she was attacked by police officers and the public over the show, Mrs Barnes attempted to deflect criticism this morning, claiming that the programme put 'too much emphasis on me as an individual'

Mrs Barnes tried to play down public anger at the show this morning, publishing a defence of her decision to appear on TV on her website.

On what her 'Crime Onion' means: 'Oh God, I've got no idea - I can't tell you actually - I wasn't thinking I'd be talking about the actual onion (the concentric circles) as we call it - umm I don't know know really - everything's important.'

On her job: 'Oh dear, what is a police commissioner? Right, well it's not the Police Commissioner, it's the Police and Crime Commissioner.

'It's a strange job because there is actually no description at all - there are certain responsibilities you have to do, but there is no actual job description.'

On her Ann Force One battle bus: 'My budget is £317million, £15,000 is money well spent - I could have had a top of range Mercedes, but it's not my image.'

She wrote: 'Many people have given their views on the programme and have speculated about my motivation for doing it.

'The only reason I agreed to do the documentary was to help people to better understand the job of a police and crime commissioner.

'The decision to let a film crew examine the work of the office for four months was not one I took lightly.

'I hoped it would give an insight into what is being done to help achieve the best possible police service for Kent.

'The film does go some way to addressing the complexities of the job and illustrates some of the challenges involved.

'But I am disappointed that there is too much emphasis on me as an individual and not enough on the work of the office.

'I know 
that much of what the office has achieved was filmed and I am frustrated
 that these scenes did not make it through to the final version.'

Mrs Barnes
 was elected as the first PCC in Kent in November 2012 despite 
previously branding the Government's plan to increase police 
accountability a 'wilful waste of money'.

Ann Barnes stands next to Paris Brown, Britain's first youth crime commissioner who quit when it was revealed she had posted a series of highly offensive comments online

She
 became the most high-profile of the country’s 41 crime tsars a year ago
 when The Mail on Sunday revealed her £15,000 youth commissioner, Paris 
Brown, 17, had posted a series of highly offensive comments online.

Miss
 Brown wrote the messages during the last six months before she was 
given the role of helping the force ‘stay in touch with young people’.

She
 called homosexuals ‘fags’, immigrants ‘illegals’ and travellers 
‘pikeys’, and said she had ‘a thing for older men’, an apparent 
reference to a teacher at her former school.

Mrs Barnes tried to save the teenager's job, but Brown was forced to quit.

Scathing: Commissioner Bob Jones claims PCCs have been a £100m waste of money

Police and crime commissioners have the job of ‘bringing communities closer to the police, building confidence in the system and restoring trust’.

They were brought in across England and Wales in November 2012 by the Conservatives to set budgets and decide on strategies while also holding chief constables to account.

But lack of enthusiasm for the reform meant the polls were held with little publicity, and a record low 15 per cent of voters turned out.

They are tasked with creating a police and crime plan, setting the force budget and appointing or dismissing the chief constable.

The former police authorities also had the power to hire and fire chief constables but this rarely happened.

But one of the elected crime tsars branded them £100million waste of money and spend their time dreaming up gimmicks and clashing with senior officers.

The Labour PCC for the West Midlands Bob Jones confessed that in their first year in charge of police forces, Police and Crime Commissioners did not make them run better nor made the public safer.

PCCs have become embroiled in a series of  scandals, including:

Cumbria’s Tory PCC Richard Rhodes took two chauffeur-driven trips to meetings, costing taxpayers £700, and when the news was leaked to a local paper, the whistleblower was arrested.

PCCs in Gwent and Lincolnshire forced out their chief constables. In each force only one person applied to take over the top job.

A dozen or so PCCs handed out well-paid deputy roles to friends and allies without advertising them.

At least four PCCs have already been investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission for alleged criminal misconduct.

Several PCCs have caused controversy over expenses, including Norfolk’s Stephen Bett who declared his home as his place of work, allowing him to claim mileage for driving to the force HQ. He agreed to repay £3,000.
