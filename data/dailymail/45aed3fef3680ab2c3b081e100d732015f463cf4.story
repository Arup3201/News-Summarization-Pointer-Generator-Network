A driver has taken a photograph of the moment he was allegedly charged more than the advertised pence per litre when he filled up his car with petrol at a BP garage.

Attila Boros took the picture as he filled up his vehicle in Cambridgeshire, after noticing he was apparently being charged more per litre than the advertised 123.9p. 

His photo, which has been shared on Facebook by more than 15,000 people, appears to show him being charged 125p for one litre of fuel as opposed to the advertised pence per litre price.   

This is the image taken by a Facebook user known as Attila Boros  appearing to show a BP garage charging more for petrol than it was advertising

Attila Boros (pictured) said he took the photo on November 11 at a BP garage in  Girton, Cambridgeshire

Mr Boros said he took the photo on Sunday, November 11, at a BP garage in Huntingdon Road, Girton, Cambridgeshire.

Posting the image on Facebook, he wrote: 'Now I heard about garages starting to clock the pumps to charge you more than advertised, so I started putting the test to the theory and low (sic) and behold -they were right.'

He added: 'Now 1.1pence per litre is nothing extra out of my pocket I'm going to miss really but imagine how much money they will accumulate and many people this garage is scamming.'

He said he went to speak to a garage sales person and showed him the photo but claims the sales person just 'shrugged his shoulders and smiled'.

He posted the photograph to warn other motorists to be vigilant and called for people to share his post.

He said the extra pence per litre led to the garage making hundreds of pounds extra money every day for every full tank and thousands of pounds each month.

He said: '[It is] illegally taking 1000s of pounds out of innocent people's pockets for a product deemed as a necessity, when money is tight enough as it is.'

A reporter who visited the same BP Garage in Girton today did not experience the same problem.

A spokesman for BP said that the petrol station was owned and operated by the MRH Retail.

MRH explained to MailOnline today that the price was in fact correct and more fuel had actually been dispensed than could be shown on the pumps display.

In a statement, the firm said: 'The £1.25 cost is the correct price for the 1.008 litres of fuel.

'As this pump head only displays to two decimal places it will still only show 1 litre for £1.25 and not the full amount dispensed. 

'The pump also has to dispense a minimum of 2 litres before a sale can take place, this is stated on the display.'
