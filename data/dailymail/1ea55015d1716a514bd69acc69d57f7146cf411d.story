A pub owner has riled gun enthusiasts by putting up a sign in his window banning firearms from the establishment and calling those who carry them 'losers'.

The owner of the Backstreets Pub and Deli in Clemson, South Carolina, put up his potentially provocative handmade sign around St Patrick's Day.

The full notice read: 'No concealed weapons allowed.

'If you are such a loser that you feel a need to carry a gun with you when you go out, I do not want your business. D****bag.'

A South Carolina bar owner put this sign up in his bar - causing outrage among gun advocates

The sign was photographed by one upset drinker who uploaded it online - and it subsequently went viral.

Previously, the bar and restaurant averaged three out of five stars on Yelp. It also had mainly positive reviews on its Facebook page.

But after the sign was spotted by gun advocates online, that rating has nosedived.

Now the bar has over 300 reviews - it previously only had three - by people who allegedly found the pub had 'bad service' and was 'overpriced'.

One of the users even posted on the pub's Facebook page claiming she: 'Threw my guts up for three days straight after eating the wings.'

Another user, Bill Mallett, said: 'Not very good food... very bad service.. the kind of place you see on those restaurant fix it shows. Would not recommend.

Danny Graham added: 'Get one star because it's not letting me put zero. Didn't like the bar and didn't like the sign up dogging concealed carriers and calling us D****bags. Won't spend my money at some bigots c*** shack.'

Michael Breaux Jnr wrote: 'Looks like you don't support the liberties provided by certain aspects of our great constitution. If you don't like it Canada is to the north and Mexico to the south so feel free.'

Hitting back, the pub's owner wrote: 'Sorry, but I'm not sorry. If you feel the need to bring a gun into a college bar you are a douche bag.

'And if you're drinking than you are violating the law.'

Perhaps fueling the fire, the man later wrote he himself is a gun owner who did not like 'irrational...gun nuts'.

He then posted pictures of more permanent-looking signs - which were yet again blasted by users.

Last month, South Carolina passed a law which allows licensed pistol owners to take concealed weapons into pubs and bars - as long as they don't drink while inside.

Such places can enforce their own weapon bans - as long as they warn customers.
