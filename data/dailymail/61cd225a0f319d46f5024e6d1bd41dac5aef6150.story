Lovesick Romeo: Ben Robbins, 24, of Baldock, Bedfordshire was sentenced at Luton Magistrates Court after admitting stalking his ex Tania Malin

A lovesick Romeo was branded a stalker today after his desperate attempts to use flowers and snowballs to win back an ex-girlfriend earned him community service.

Ben Robbins, 24, climbed a ladder to Tania Maylin's window, leapt on her car bonnet to stop her driving away and put flowers on her windscreen.

However, Ms Maylin, terrified by Robbins' obsession with her, had no intention of rekindling their relationship.

She told police that Robbins had also threatened to kill any new boyfriend she got and offered her friends cash for her phone number after she changed it to avoid his calls.

Robbins admitted he was 'off his head' when he harassed his ex-girlfriend and her friends, paying visits to their homes, making phone calls and sending text messages.

Nevertheless, his barrister refuted comparisons with the film Fatal Attraction.

Robbins, of Baldock, Hertfordshire, admitted a single charge under the new Protection from Harassment Act.

It is the first conviction of its kind under the new law, which was amended on November 25 last year to make stalking a specific offence in England and Wales

Magistrates handed him a two-year community order, including compulsory attendance on a domestic abuse programme, and 80 hours of unpaid work.

He must also pay £85 in court costs and a £60 victim surcharge.

Miss Maylin, in a letter to the court, said her former boyfriend's behaviour had annoyed and frightened her, but that she was a firm believer of people making 'stupid mistakes' being given a second chance.

The victim, also 24, went even further, asking that a restraining order should not be imposed as she wanted to remain in contact with Robbins.

Prosecutor Shahida Parveen told magistrates yesterday how Robbins and Miss Maylin had been in a relationship for about 12 months, until early this year.

'The complainant says she ended the relationship due to this defendant's controlling nature,' she said. 'He had been going through her phone to see who she had been messaging and calling her friends to see where she was.

'He even took a photo of her work rota to know when she was working.'

After she broke up with him on January 15, Robbins took to sending her messages, via text and on Facebook.

When Miss Maylin changed her phone number he asked a mutual friend for the new one and continued the harassment.

One day, after turning up at Miss Maylin's home in Arlesey, Bedfordshire, and being told to leave by her mother, he threw snowballs at her window to get her attention.

'Police were called. He was now up a ladder, put up against the complainant's window and was looking in,' said the prosecutor.

On Valentine's Day he sent her a card 'begging her to come back' and a week later was back at her home, throwing stones at her window, before later sending her a clipping of his dreadlocks and leaving a rose on her car.

The court heard that earlier this month he sent a text message to a friend saying he was going to kill himself, only to appear at Miss Maylin's home again the next day.

'On one occasion he offered a friend of hers £200 pounds for her new mobile phone number,' said Ms Parveen.

'He started saying he would kill any new boyfriend of hers. He was pretending to be someone else on the phone and was asking her out for a drink on Facebook, and was questioning her about any other cars parked next to her car.'

Harassment: Robbins continually turned up at Miss Maylin's home, climbed a ladder to her window, sent her clippings of his dreadlocks, left flowers on her car - and threatened to kill any new lover she met

Miss Maylin told Luton magistrates in her witness impact statement that her former boyfriend's behaviour had so frightened her that she would check her car every time she used it in case he had done something to it.

She would constantly look over her shoulder and her colleagues would walk her from the building when she left work.

She said: 'I know he gets drugged-up and drives around asking for me. I just want to get on with my life.'

Andy Corcutt, defending, said in 
mitigation: 'This is the case of a young man in his first relationship, 
with a significant drug problem, going over the top.

'The lock of hair and the flower on the car are very clichéd.

'The defendant is mortified.'

He said his client was now drug-free and that 'something of a light' had switched on in his head and that he now understood the impact of his actions on Miss Maylin.

'This is not the sort of case of the Fatal Attraction type. This is not a case of physical violence towards this lady,' he said.

Presiding magistrate Barry Neale told the defendant: 'We heard Miss Maylin's description of what all this had done to her.

'She just wanted to get on with her life and you didn't let her. The bench feels you should get on with your life, grow up and show a bit of maturity.'
