Massive ice floes rose out of a lake in Canada over the
weekend, destroying a dozen homes and damaging fifteen others.

Within mere moments, strong winds drove piles of ice onto
the shore from Dauphin Lake on Friday, inundating homes and giving
residents only minutes to flee.

55-mile-per hour winds drove masses of ice from the thawing lake in a phenomenon that is commonly witnessed but rarely seen with such intensity and size.

Dwarfed: Winds forced massive walls of ice onto the shores of Lake Dauphin, dwarfing homes in rural Manitoba, Canada on Friday

By Friday night, a state of emergency had been declared in
the town of Ochre River, a 188 miles northwest of Winnipeg.

Authorities told the Winnipeg Free Press that seven of the
destroyed homes were ‘literally crushed by the ice that rose up within minutes
from Lake Dauphin.’

Twenty-seven homes were affected in total as the frozen wall to plowed through everything in its way
along Ochre Beach.

Though the moving ice was as tall as a house in places, no
injuries have been reported.

Nonetheless, residents were still shaken Saturday

Unusual: A dozen homes were destroyed and many others left uninhabitable after winds piled ice onto Ochre Beach Friday in an unusually large ice flow

Terrifying: Homeowners had only minutes to flee as the mounting ice entered their doors and windows

Even some of those whose houses remained standing were
allowed inside only to collect their belongings after authorities declared many
of the seemingly spared dwellings to be structurally unfit to inhabit.

One family told the Free Press the ice easily topped and pushed
into their two-story home, shuffled moved furniture around, and ‘pushed the
bathroom tub and vanity into the hallway.’

‘They heard it before they saw it coming up their decks,’ Ochre
River deputy Reeve Clayton Watts told the Free Press Saturday. ‘Then, it came
right in their front windows. It was just a matter of minutes. Fortunately, no
one was hurt. We were very lucky.’

Unlucky: The affected town Ochre River, 188 miles outside Winnipeg, had only recently begun to recover from severe floods in 2011

Help: Hundreds of volunteers showed up Saturday to help dig Ochre Beach out of the massive ice floe

The town, still reeling from a severe 2011 flood that
destroyed many homes, was somber but not helpless.

Watts was one hand for Saturday’s clean-up efforts, which saw
friends and neighbors come together to get the community back on its feet.

Hundreds of volunteers were on hand with shovels, wheel
barrows, and even bulldozers to dig the town out.

‘Everybody was pitching in to help them make it through the
day,’ Watts said. ‘It was a good community effort. It’s typical. Everybody just
helps out.’

Severe: Many of the 27 affected homes were not destroyed, but still deemed uninhabitable

A similar phenomenon occurred around 600 miles away at a Minnesota lake resort.

And though the ice wave on the American side wasn't nearly was as destructive, it still had some residents calling it an 'ice Tsunami' and marveling at its unbelievable speed, according to WCCO.

Youtube user Darla Johnson uploaded footage of ice rising out of Milles Lacs Lake and into the townhomes of Izatys Resort on May 11.

The same high wind weather system is thought to have caused both incidents.

Again: Some of the leveled homes were brand new, having just been rebuilt in the wake of severe 2011 flooding

Homeless: Canadian officials were at work Saturday helping the community dig out of the ice and to find shelter for those left homeless by the floe
