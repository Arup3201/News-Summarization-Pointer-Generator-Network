Mark Hughes has backed the FA’s probe into Garry Monk and insisted that Victor Moses is no cheat.

The Stoke manager also said he hoped officials would not have their impression of his winger swayed by the media attention.

Monk has been asked for an explanation of his comments following Swansea’s defeat to Stoke on Sunday, where he raged at Moses for alleged diving and claimed referee Michael Oliver had cheated his side.

Oliver awarded Stoke a penalty when Moses fell under contact from Angel Rangel in the area. Stoke chairman Peter Coates made a complaint to the FA about Monk’s accusations.

‘It’s right that the FA have to ask for Garry’s comments,’ said Hughes. ‘I made my feelings known at the end of the game. We have a strongly held view.

‘Now it’s up to them whether to take it further. It’s disappointing as it overshadowed our performance.

‘Garry’s a very articulate young man and on this occasion maybe used the wrong words. That can happen. Victor said he felt contact and was impeded, just as I thought.’

Hughes insisted the furore should not dictate observer’s impressions of the 23-year-old – including referees.

‘Victor is a very strong-minded player and will get on with business of playing well for Stoke City,’ he said. ‘I hope this week doesn’t shape people’s view of him. What was said of him wasn’t correct.’
