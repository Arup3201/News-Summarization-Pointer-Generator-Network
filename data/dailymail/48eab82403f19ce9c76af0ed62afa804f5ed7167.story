A woman who has had an unusually deep voice since birth could not cancel her Sky subscription because call centre staff refused to believe she wasn't a man.

Due to abnormally enlarged vocal chords, Norma Clarke, 56, from Eccles, Greater Manchester has spoken like a man for as long as she can remember.

She said: 'When people call the house phone and ask for Mrs Norma Clarke, they don’t believe it’s me.

'I wasn’t able to cancel my Sky package because the person at the other end of the line didn’t believe I was a woman.'

She added: 'I get the same response every time I speak to someone on the phone.

'I can't disguise my voice, I tried. On the phone, from what I've been told, my voice sounds even deeper than when you see me in the flesh.

'Whenever I'm on the phone, it kind of starts with the person on the other end going "Hello, can I speak to Mrs Clarke' and I say "This is Mrs Clarke".

'Then the other person responds with "No, can I speak to Mrs Clarke?" and I say, "No this is Mrs Clarke". This goes on for five minutes.

'This isn’t just a one-off thing. I’ve been the butt of jokes for years. Even my daughters take the mickey out of me.'

Mrs Clarke, who grew up in Middleton, Greater Manchester, with three sisters and two brothers, has had her mannish voice since birth.

'Growing up, my voice was as deep as both my brothers’ voices but it was never an issue or a problem in my family,' she said.

Mrs Clarke at 17. She has suffered with a deep voice her whole life, but doesn't let it get her down

'I never heard my mum say, "Let’s take you to the doctor so they can take a look at your vocal chords". It was just something I had.

'I only fully realized what an unusual voice it was at the age of ten when I went to a booth in town and recorded a vinyl of myself singing "Leaving On A Jet Plane".

'We didn’t have tape recorders at that time so it was the first time I’d ever listened to my voice. I had no idea I sounded like that!'

She has seen several doctors about her masculine voice but there’s no cure for her condition.

'Every new GP at the local surgery asks if there’s something wrong with my voice and if I’ve always spoken like this,' she said.

'The last time I had it checked out was ten years ago. The doctors put a camera down my throat and found that my vocal chords were thicker than anyone else’s that they had ever seen - man or woman.

'Apparently this thickness was very unusual to have in a woman. The doctors did try to look for a way to make them thinner and give me a more feminine voice. But they said nothing would work.'

The mother-of-four, who has worked in a bakery for over 25 years, says that her macho voice has caused problems over the years.

She added: 'It’s still a bit embarrassing for me when people hear my voice in a restaurant and they turn their head round.

'When I open my mouth and talk, I can see people thinking "Is she really a woman?"’

'Kids around town call me "the woman with the voice" - they come into the bakery just to hear me speak.

'A few younger blokes have come into the store and tried to belittle me but I just say "When you get a voice like mine, come back". They always leave rather embarrassed.'

Mrs Clarke was shocked when she first heard her voice on a recording of John Denver's 'Leaving On A Jet Plane'. Left, as a six-year-old and right, in 1977

Fun: Although it has caused Norma (pictured in 1988) problems, she also enjoys using her voice to play pranks on people

However, she tries to have a sense of humour about her voice, saying: 'I’m dead outgoing. I like a good chuckle and I like to laugh at myself. Because of that, I’ve been able to overcome all of the stick I get.

'I play jokes on people. I once pretended that I was my friend’s new boyfriend when she was speaking to her brother in Canada on Skype! He completely believed it.'

She is married to medical courier driver, John Clarke, 61, and they have four daughters and six grandchildren. Mrs Clarke says that her voice has never deterred the opposite sex.

She explains: 'I’ve been married twice and I’ve never had any problems with men because of my voice at all. I think they liked that I was a little bit different.'
