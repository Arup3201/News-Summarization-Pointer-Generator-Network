Cream songwriter Gail Collins, who gained infamy for shooting dead her rock star husband in 1983, has died in a Mexican village aged 72.

Collins's landlord found her dead in her apartment on December 6 in Ajijic, a mountain resort town, where she had been living as a recluse with her three cats.

A close friend of the infamous lyricist suggested to goodreads.com blogger David J. Krajicek that the star's dying moments - alone and exiled - were somehow penance for the deadly events 30 years ago.

'It’s something she lived with every day of her life - one of 
those piece-of-s*** moments that you never get away from, no matter how 
hard you try,' Diane Pearl said.

Neighbor Joan Montgomery said a veterinarian euthanized Collins' three cats once her body was removed. 

'She left instructions for her cats to be euthanized so their ashes could be mixed with hers,' Montgomery said. 'Who does that?'

Meanwhile Pearl said the strong-willed artist always wanted to be the center of attention.

'She was one of the most brilliant people I have ever known, but she was also an opinionated jackass,' she said.

'It was her way or the highway. Ego, the thing that drove her brilliance, also destroyed most of her relationships. She just needed to be the star.

'And if someone else was going to be the star, she rebelled against it. It was like a very strange competition of trying to be the best at everything.'

According to Krajicek, Collins told people she moved to Mexico for experimental cancer treatment.

Collins, who was known locally by her middle name Delta, also claimed she was one of 24 guinea pig patients receiving 'nutrition-infused medicines' from doctor supposedly linked to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.

Collins was considered one of the most intriguing musical figures of the 1960s and 1970s.

She was married to the legendary bass player/producer Felix Pappalardi of Mountain, a ground-breaking hard rock band from New York.

An inspired writer, Collins penned the trippy lyrics that Eric Clapton sang in 'Strange Brew,' a single from Cream’s 1967 psychedelic classic, 'Disraeli Gears', which Pappalardi produced.

She became a creative force behind Mountain, writing lyrics for most of the band’s songs and painting their album cover art.

However, her life took a turn for the worst in 1983 when she shot and killed Pappalardi after he returned to their  Waterside Plaza, New York apartment following a tryst with a lover.

Convicted of criminally negligent homicide, Collins spent two years in prison and disappeared after her 1985 parole.
