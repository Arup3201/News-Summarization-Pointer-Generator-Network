Her next tweets also appeared to be angrily directed at the Notting Hill star.

She tweeted: 'Hey Hag! Glad you f****ed with me yet? You’re going to LOVE what’s coming! FYI-You’re an awful, hate filled old pathetic excuse for a human.

'I must be grateful & not hateful. I must forgive. But Damn that is a REALLY hard thing to do sometimes, right?!?!'

Back on December 19, Nancy also sounded depressed. She wrote: 'I must remember how blessed I am even in this very low point in my life. I want ALL of my family to have an awesome magical Christmas!'

And on December 15 she tweeted: 'Must remember to stay strong. Life is a fight. You have to stay in it.'

Back in October Nancy also spoke about her family rift, tweeting: 'It’s a shame when you get more support from strangers than you do from your family. I can’t wait to officially belong to another family!'

She also wrote that she was getting support from her and Julia’s mother Betty, writing: 'So glad to have the support & love of my friends & mom!

Nancy last tweeted on Saturday, the day before she was found dead in the bathtub.

She wrote: 'Hope everyone is enjoying their Saturdays & watching East Los High! Season 3 coming soon!'

Nancy joined twitter last August and had 69 followers.

She posted several happy photos with her fiancé John Dilbeck who she was due to marry on May 17.

On October 3 she tweeted a photo of them together, writing: 'YAY! Wedding Venue found! Wedding dress found! Things are truly happening! It's all soooo exciting! I love him!'

Since her tormented tweets were made public overnight, they key sections have been deleted.

On Monday, her family confirmed to People the 37-year-old had passed away in what appears to be an overdose.

'It is with deep sadness that the family of Nancy Motes ... confirms that she was found dead in Los Angeles yesterday of an apparent drug overdose,' the statement read. 'There is no official report from the Coroner's office yet. The family is both shocked and devastated.'

She was discovered in the bathtub of a home by her fiancé John Dilbeck and pronounced dead at 2:12 p.m., a spokesman for the Los Angeles Coroner's Office told MailOnline.

It is believed she was found at a house where she was pet-sitting for a friend.

Today, Ed Winter, assistant chief at the LA County Coroner's Office, said: ‘The autopsy has been completed and the cause of death has been deferred depending on the toxicology reports. This can take between six and eight weeks.

‘A number of prescription medications were found in the bathroom area as were illegal drugs. We are still investigating whether they were hers or not. We’re not releasing what illegal drugs they were.

‘It could be a possible suicide, but we don’t know the cause of death yet for sure, which is depending on further investigation. It’s more complicated as she also had some medical issues, so we’re not sure what happened at the moment.

'We are not being specific what those issues are, but it could mean a number of reasons for her death, she could have been taking a bath and had a heart attack. We just don’t know at this stage.'

Julia's rep did not return calls to MailOnline. The actress cancelled an appearance at an Academy Awards luncheon on Monday.

Nancy was an aspiring actress who had worked as a production assistant on TV's Glee.

Julia and Nancy had the same mother, Betty Lou, but different fathers: Nancy's dad was Michael Motes and Julia's is the late Walter Grady Roberts.

In August the blonde had complained about growing up in the shadow of the Pretty Woman star, who has been working the awards circuit this year for her turn in August: Osage County with Meryl Streep.

The younger sibling had said she was known as Julia's 'fat little sister' and said the Oscar-winner had taunted her about her weight, leading her to undergo weight loss surgery in June 2012.

Roberts, 46, made her feel embarrassed and ashamed of her weight, according to Nancy, which peaked at 20st.

She resorted to a £20,000 gastric bypass operation last year.

'It makes me feel incredibly hurt and very sad,' Motes said. 'When you're in a family of very, very exceptionally beautiful people it's intimidating.'

Her other siblings include Eric Roberts, 57, and Lisa Roberts Gillan, 48, who are also actors.

Actress Emma Roberts is the daughter of Eric.

'I think that growing up as Pretty Woman's little sister has definitely made me try to see the person inside and not the person outside,' she added. 'A lot of my life I felt judged for my weight.'

Motes, who grew up in the US state of Georgia, was only 13 when Roberts shot to Hollywood fame as hooker Vivian Ward in Pretty Woman.

The actress, who had won a Golden Globe for playing a young bride in Steel Magnolias, received a second for Pretty Woman.

Motes, who described herself as an 'awkward' child who was bullied at school, could not compete with the success of her 'very pretty and very popular' sister.

She said: 'When I was in high school and she was an adult, she would just let me know that I was definitely overweight. She would make it quite clear to me and in a not so nice manner.

'Julia did not want to see me go down that path [of acting] … So I just got a lot of criticism from Julia, which was very discouraging for me.'

After graduating from high school in 1995, Motes auditioned for roles in Hollywood while working as a waitress. But she could not afford to continue so returned to Georgia.

Niece: Emma Roberts, pictured Monday with Evan Peters, was Nancy's niece

Three years ago Nancy moved back to Los Angeles, after meeting her fiancé John Dilbeck. But she claimed Roberts started taunting her about her weight again days after she arrived.

With her weight soaring, she finally decided to have a gastric bypass fitted.

Motes said she could not afford the £20,000 fee, but rather than ask Roberts, who is worth £90million, for financial help, she took out a loan.

She had lost 7st since the operation last June and had planned on marrying in May.

However, RadarOnline reported last year that Julia planned to boycott the nuptials because she didn't like the groom and didn't want to get stuck paying for the wedding.

'Julia doesn't think much of Nancy's husband-to-be,' the website quoted an insider as saying. 'She's convinced he's sponging off Nancy, who doesn't have much money in the first place.'

At the time of her death, it was not known if she had mended her relationship with Julia.

She said last year: 'It's a work in progress, it's not going to be fixed overnight, nor do I think it's going to be fixed by me just getting skinny.'
