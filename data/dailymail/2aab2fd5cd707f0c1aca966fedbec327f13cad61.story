David Cameron mistakenly left his eight-year-old daughter in a pub by herself when he drove off without her, it was revealed last night.

The Prime Minister – who had been enjoying Sunday drinks with his family near Chequers – only realised his eldest daughter was missing when he arrived back at his official country residence.

The Camerons had been drinking at the Plough Inn, in Cadsden, Buckinghamshire, with their three children and two other families.

David Cameron, pictured holding his daughter Nancy at a wedding in 2007, thought Samantha Cameron had all their children but she thought Nancy was with him

As they went to leave, Nancy went off to the toilet without telling them.

The Prime Minister was driven back to Chequers, which is two miles from the pub, with protection officers in one car, while Mrs Cameron drove their other children in another.

Mr Cameron presumed that Nancy was in the car with his wife, while she thought that their daughter had jumped in with the Prime Minister.

A spokesman for the Prime Minister last night said he was ‘distraught’ when he realised what had happened.

They later confirmed that Mrs Cameron returned to the pub to pick up Nancy.

‘Thankfully when they phoned the pub she was there safe and well,’ the spokesman said. ‘The Prime Minister went down straight away to get her.’

When Mr Cameron arrived back at the pub he found his daughter happily helping the pub staff. It is understood she had been left by herself for 15 minutes.

A Downing Street spokeswoman said today that the Camerons take full responsibility for looking after their children and were not blaming security officers for failing to ensure that Nancy was with the party before returning to Chequers.

'They are their children and they take responsibility for them,' said the spokeswoman.

'No-one is going to face disciplinary action. This was an error.'

The spokeswoman declined to discuss whether Mr Cameron had drunk alcohol.

'He had gone with friends at 
lunchtime, with a number of families with children, and they left in 
various different vehicles,' she said.

'As you know, the Prime Minister is a very busy man but he always tries to live as normal a life as possible with his family.'

Asked how often this involved a visit to the pub, she replied: 'Occasionally.'

The spokeswoman declined to discuss 
the security arrangements around Mr Cameron and his family but said they
were always kept under review.

Last night a pub ‘insider’ said: ‘You’d have thought that someone would have done a headcount or something.’

Chillaxing? David Cameron enjoys a pint during a visit to a brewery

The
source told The Sun: ‘It’s not like you can look up David Cameron in 
the phonebook and then ring to say you’ve left your daughter behind.

‘It’s frightening that the Prime Minister of Britain can forget something so important as his own daughter.’

Friends of Mr Cameron last month told how he enjoyed drinking ‘three or four glasses of wine’ over lunch at the weekend.

The revelations were in a biography that criticised the amount of time the Prime Minister spends ‘chillaxing’

The
book records weekends at Chequers singing karaoke, playing frames of 
snooker, and tennis against a machine dubbed ‘The Clegger’.

After long lunches the Prime Minister likes to recharge his batteries with an afternoon nap, the book claimed.

A source told the authors: ‘If there was an Olympic gold medal for ‘chillaxing’, the Prime Minister would win it.’

One adviser claimed that the Prime Minister ‘spends a crazy, scary amount of time playing Fruit Ninja’, a computer game in which players use a cartoon sword to slash fast-moving fruit.

Mr Cameron has previously been branded ‘DVD Dave’ for his love of watching Danish dramas in bed with his wife Samantha.He also finds time for a weekly date night.

Plough landlord Steve Hollings, who has run the pub with his wife Sharon for more than 13 years, said the Prime Minister and his family regularly pop in for lunch or drinks.

Mr Hollings said Mr Cameron had again been in the pub with his family at lunchtime yesterday, and had spent about an hour there.

Speaking as he prepared the bar for the lunchtime rush, Mr Hollings confided that the incident happened 'some time ago.'

'It certainly wasn't this weekend, or three weeks ago as they are saying on TV,' he insisted.

Mr Hollings said: 'What do you want me to say? That he's a neglecting father? Well he's not.

'He's a great father and genuine family man and a genuine guy.

'I've only got good things to say about him.

'He's not the Prime Minister when he comes down here, he's just David Cameron, a family man.'

The Plough has been nestled in the picturesque Chiltern Hills since the 16th century and is the oldest pub in the area.

Its traditional Sunday roast is served  for £14.95.

The Prime Minister and his family spent Boxing Day lunch at the pub.
