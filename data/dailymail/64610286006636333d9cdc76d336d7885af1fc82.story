An Indonesian woman accused of ordering a deadly hit on her Australian husband will face charges that could see her handed the death penalty if found guilty.

Police on Friday handed over dossiers of evidence in the case of Julaikah Noor Aini, known as Noor Ellis, who is charged with plotting the murder of her businessman husband Robert Ellis.

It is alleged Mrs Ellis paid her maid's boyfriend to kill her wealthy husband last October. Mrs Ellis allegedly paid 150 million rupiah ($A14,200) for the hit. She is accused of taking someone's life, deliberately and with planning. The maximum penalty is death.

Her five alleged accomplices - including the men who allegedly slit Mr Ellis' throat in the kitchen of his Bali villa - face the same charges.

The police dossiers tell of a troubled marriage spanning years. The couple had been married for 20 years and had had two Perth-based sons, Jon and Peter, together. 

‘Regarding motive, the police dossiers are more about cheating and wealth,’ Prosecutor Made Dipa Umbara.

Mrs Ellis' lawyer Ketut Suwega Arya Dauh said she regretted the crime.

‘She did it out of stress and being hurtful because she felt unappreciated as a wife. We're ready to defend her in the trial,’ Mr Suwega said. 

The body of the 60-year-old was found wrapped in plastic and dumped in a ditch in the rice field near Sedang Village in late October.

He was set upon in his own Bali kitchen by the killers who slashed his throat 'like killing a pig', police said, after Mrs Ellis employed the men along with two housemaids to clean up the murder.

His wife, who was taken into custody after confessing to her role in the crime, helped local officials to recreate the murder.

A reconstruction of the contract murder of the Australian businessman took place in Bali last November after Mrs Ellis admitted to her role in the crime. 

The re-enactment involved Mrs Ellis, the two maids, and three of the men arrested for carrying out the murder, reported The Sydney Morning Herald. 

Police officers filled in to play the roles of two wanted suspects who are still at large.

One of the men arrested, known as Urbanas, was told by Mrs Ellis during the enactment that 'that you could kill him but not sadistically.' 

Urbanas agreed that she had told him that, and the two were snapped showing their agreement to the deal by linking pinky fingers. 

Bali police said Mr Ellis' was found with his hands and feet tied, and a bed cover had been put over his body.

'There is no doubt this was an execution-style murder,' said a senior police officer in the Bali capital, Denpasar.

Mr Ida Bagus Putu Alit, who headed the district's forensic team, said Mr Ellis' throat had been slashed three times. 

'One of the wounds to the throat was fatal, but he also had several bruises around his head, suggesting he had been knocked to the ground before receiving the fatal throat wound,' he said.  

During the re-enactment, Mrs Ellis showed how she had paid Aril, the boyfriend of one of her maids, 100 million rupia, through the window of a car. 

Mr Ellis and his wife had been living in Bali for nearly 20 years, and had reportedly been experiencing marital difficulties for the past years, stemming from money problems and accusations of infidelity.

'The motive is because his wife felt embittered with the victim,' Badung police chief Komang Suartana told News Corp.

'Because of many things. She said that her husband is often cheating on her.'
