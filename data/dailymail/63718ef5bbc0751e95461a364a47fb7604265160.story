A stunning rural landscape hailed as one of the finest views in England by the National Trust could be ruined by a 242ft high wind turbine.

The outlook from Creech Hill towards the imposing King Alfred's Tower on the Stourhead Estate has become an iconic image of the Somerset Levels.

It features in the book 'England's 100 Best Views' and features Iron Age forts, a Roman temple and ancient woodlands.

Under threat: Creech Hill lies seven miles to the north west of the Stourhead Estate, which is owned by the National Trust

But the skyline is under threat after plans were submitted for a towering turbine which would provide enough power for 400 local homes.

The proposals come from Swansea-based firm Seren Energy run by Steve Hack,a Friends of the Earth board member. 

He admitted the site is contentious, but said the overall impact on the area will be minimal. 

'As far as South Somerset is concerned there are relatively limited opportunities for turbines,' he said.

'But this is relatively simple as far as good conditions and delivery are concerned and there are not that many people who live very close to the site. The overall impact on the local population is going to be low.'

But local residents and the National Trust fear the development will tarnish the treasured landscape.

Swansea-based Seren Energy have put in an application for the lone turbine, which is says will power 400 local homes

A National Trust spokesman said: 'Stourhead is an incredibly special place and we want to make sure its setting, the wider landscape and views, both to and from, are protected.

'We believe that appropriately designed wind has an important part to play in a mix of British renewables, but it must work in harmony with the landscape.

'We are now carefully considering this planning application and the scale and location of the proposed wind turbine.'

Creech Hill lies seven miles to the north west of the Stourhead Estate, which is owned by the National Trust.

King Alfred's Tower, also known as The Folly of King Alfred the Great or Stourton Tower, is a folly built in the 18th century that looks out over the Somerset Levels.

It lies near the location of 'Egbert's stone' where it is believed that Alfred the Great, King of Wessex, rallied the Saxons in May 878 before the Battle of Ethandun.

The tower was also intended to commemorate the end of the Seven Years' War against France and the accession of King George III. 

It was designed by Henry Flitcroft, a Palladian architect, in 1765 and completed in 1772.

The tower was damaged in 1944 when an aeroplane, a Noorduyn Norseman, crashed into it, resulting in the death of the five aircrew.

Then it was designated as a Grade I listed building before being restored in 1986.

It is home to King Alfred's Tower - a 160ft tall folly tower marking the spot where King Alfred rallied the forces of Somerset, Dorset and Wiltshire, before his decisive defeat at the Battle of Edington in 878AD.

It was erected in the mid 18th century by banker Henry Hoare II, then owner of the Stourhead estate, and dominates the landscape in the Cranborne Chase Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

In his book 'England's 100 Best Views', the National Trust's chairman Sir Simon Jenkins describes the vista from Creech Hill towards Stourhead as the best view of the Somerset Levels.

He wrote: 'Creech Hill stands seven miles to the north and is closer to the Levels. It looks up to Stourhead behind it, and looks across to Cadbury to the left.

'It directly overlooks the golden limestone town of Bruton, deep in the Brue valley and with only its church and dovecot visible from a distance.'

Seren Energy has submitted plans to South Somerset District Council to erect the turbine at Gilcombe Farm, a 300-acre family organic farm.

But Dick Skidmore, a former Mendip District councillor now living at Bruton, is one of many locals who have written to the planning department to object.

He believes the turbine will 'degrade a rural landscape particularly in a tourist area'.

He is also worried that photographs submitted with the application were misleading and that the Ministry of Defence will insist on it having a warning light on top.

Pen Selwood Parish Council has already raised its opposition to the turbine because of its proposed position in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

In a response to the application, it said: 'Whilst we are not sure this wind turbine will be visible from this parish, Pen Selwood Parish Council is opposed to all applications that could cause any detrimental effect upon the visual amenity of the village which is within an AONB.'

It goes on to say: 'Concern has also been expressed that this development would set a precedent for other, similar, developments and that if we are not careful these structures could spring up throughout the area and would blight the countryside around us.'

A decision from South Somerset District council is due on  September 19.
