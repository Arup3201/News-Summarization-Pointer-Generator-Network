Kenny McDowall says his elevation to the job of Rangers manager has been ‘tainted’ by the turmoil of close friend Ally McCoist’s departure.

McDowall was called to Ibrox on Sunday evening by chief executive Derek Llambias to be told he would be replacing McCoist until the end of the season at least. His first task was to tell legend Ian Durrant he had been demoted on board instructions.

Now faced with catching runaway league leaders Hearts and breathing life into a flagging promotion push at a time of unprecedented chaos, McDowall also revealed that McCoist had made an emotional farewell speech to the players on Monday urging them to make him proud by pipping their Tynecastle rivals to the Championship title.

However, flanked by his new coaching team of Gordon Durie – who has swapped jobs with Durrant – and new player-coach Lee McCulloch, McDowall used his first media conference to admit his dream job had arrived in grim circumstances.

With a shrug he said: ‘It’s tainted, isn’t it? What can you do? I’ve got to try and make the best of a bad situation.

‘Yesterday was a sad day. Ally came in to say goodbye to the players and staff. The man that he is, he finished by saying nothing would make him more proud than if they went on to win the title. The biggest tribute we can do is to try and pull that off. It would be for Ally McCoist.’

McDowall, whose first game is at Hibs on Saturday, half expected to follow McCoist out the door after Llambias called him to the stadium.

McDowall was part of McCoist's backroom staff at Ibrox, but has now taken the top job at Ibrox

‘It is normally the case in normal situations. But, at the end of the day, boards do what boards do. I can’t control what’s happened. I have just got to be professional and try to get the boys up for the game and get them back winning.’

Missing from the technical area will be Durrant after the former first-team coach was demoted to Under 20s coach. 

Revealing he was left with little option but to break the news to his long-term colleague, McDowall added: ‘As soon as they asked me to carry out my duties to take the first team they asked me if I would inform the boys of the changes they wanted to make.’

Asked if that was a task the board themselves should have undertaken, McDowall replied: ‘Possibly. That is open for debate. But they asked me if I would do it which I duly did.

‘It wasn’t easy, but the boys fully understand because at the moment there is a lot going on, a lot of positions moving about, and mine was one of them. I had to explain it was a board decision and the boys respected that and just got on with it.’

Asked to explain the rationale behind the board’s changes, he shrugged: ‘I’ve no idea. You’d have to ask the board.’

McDowall claimed McCoist’s resignation had come out of the blue despite their close friendship.

Asked when he knew of his plans, he insisted: ‘The morning it came out in the paper, believe it or not. I didn’t realise he was doing it. He never discussed it. He was obviously thinking long and hard about doing it.

‘It was a surprise to me as much as anything. But I fully expected him to be here for the year and do the notice. It didn’t happen like that so we have to get on with it.’
