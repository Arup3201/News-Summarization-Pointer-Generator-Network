More to follow suit? Tories don't want former RBS chief Fred Goodwin (above) to be the last banker to be stripped of a knighthood

Tories demanded further action against failed bankers yesterday following the decision to strip Fred Goodwin of his knighthood.

MPs called for more financiers, including colleagues of Mr Goodwin at Royal Bank of Scotland, to lose the right to be called Sir.

But others condemned the action against Mr Goodwin, with business leaders claiming it amounted to hysteria.

Mr Goodwin’s friend, motor racing champion Sir Jackie Stewart, said he thought the former bank boss had been made a scapegoat while former Chancellor Alistair Darling said the decision to take way his title was tawdry.

RBS had to be bailed out with £45billion of taxpayers’ money after Mr Goodwin steered it to the biggest corporate disaster in British history.

Senior figures in Downing Street have also discussed attempting to strip him of his massive pension.

Mr Goodwin, whose knighthood was annulled on Monday by order of the Queen, is still receiving what is effectively a tax- payer-funded pension of £342,500 a year for life from RBS.

Some Tories want to tackle him about his pension in the expectation that he would challenge such a move using the Human Rights Act.

This would boost public opposition to the Act which they want to replace with a British Bill of Rights. There were also calls for peers who have committed crimes to lose their titles.

However, business leaders protested at the removal of Mr Goodwin’s knighthood on the recommendation of a secretive Whitehall committee, claiming it was ‘hysteria’.

And former chancellor Mr Darling claimed the decision was ‘tawdry’. He added: ‘There were other knights of the realm on the board – are we going after them?’

Former Conservative chancellor Lord Lawson backed the decision on Mr Goodwin. ‘You can say “why pick him out?” but every schoolmaster knows sometimes it’s necessary to make an example,’ he said.

‘I don’t think anybody can have the slightest sympathy for Mr Goodwin, who through a mixture of vanity, greed and sheer incompetence presided over the biggest banking disaster in British history.’

Michael Fallon, deputy chairman of the Conservative Party and a member of the Treasury select committee, insisted: ‘This has not been done on a whim…this is three and a half years after the downfall of RBS and follows a very detailed report from the Financial Services Authority that details the exact role that Fred Goodwin played.’

Tory MPs last night called for Sir Victor Blank and Sir James Crosby to lose their knighthoods for their roles in the merger of Lloyds and HBOS during the financial crisis. Sir Victor was chairman of Lloyds TSB when it merged with HBOS in 2009.

Sir James was chief executive of HBOS until 2006 before becoming deputy chairman of the FSA.

One Tory said: ‘These guys were on the last helicopter out of Saigon. So we are going after them.

‘Victor Blank agreed to take over HBOS as a favour to Gordon Brown.

‘There will be an FSA report on that next year. It won’t be the  same plane crash of awfulness  that was RBS. But it will still be pretty bad.’

Mr Fallon hinted that further knighthoods could be stripped: ‘There is going to a report now from the FSA into the HBOS-Lloyds disintegration. So who knows what will follow from that?’

The affair also led to broader calls for reform of the honours system.

Labour leader Ed Miliband, who insisted his party had been wrong to nominate Mr Goodwin for his honour for ‘services to banking’ in 2004, told the Daily Mail: ‘I think there’s got to be caution exercised about who gets honours now.

‘The circumstances in which people can have these honours revoked at the moment are pretty narrow – it’s breaking the law and professional misconduct.

‘But if you damage the British economy or society, you shouldn’t be able to keep such a privilege.’

Mr Miliband said ordinary people, not civil servants, should decide whether to give or revoke honours.

He added: ‘You need a wider cross 
section than civil servants – people from civic life, church leaders, 
those representing consumers, people from business, actually, who would 
probably be near the front of the queue of saying it’s not good to have 
somebody who brings business into disrepute.’

Downing Street indicated it may look 
at ways of stripping peers of their titles where they have been 
convicted of crimes, a view backed yesterday by Scotland’s First 
Minister Alex Salmond.

Shamed: High-profile figures who have lost their knighthoods since World War Two

Peers
including Lord Archer, Lord Hanningfield and Lord Taylor have all been 
jailed but have been allowed to return to the House of Lords. ‘Why are 
they still in a legislature?’ said Mr Salmond, who was close to Mr 
Goodwin.

He admitted he now regretted his strong support for the banker.

Former
Formula 1 motor racing world champion Sir Jackie Stewart – a close 
friend of Mr Goodwin – said he thought the former bank boss had been 
made a scapegoat. ‘No single person or even any single bank created the 
biggest financial recession in modern times,’ he said.

‘To have this (knighthood) stripped is poor for the constitution and very dangerous for the future.’

In
the Commons, David Cameron and Mr Miliband traded blows as the Labour 
leader called for banks to be forced to disclose how many executives 
earn more than £1million. He said the Government was ‘part of the 
problem’ on executive pay.

 Bank
bosses have been ordered to step up efforts to claw back bonuses paid 
to executives involved in the mis-selling of payment protection 
insurance to millions of customers.

PPI
was sold to those holding credit cards or taking out loans on the 
premise that they would be able to meet their payments if they became 
ill or lost their jobs.

The 
Financial Services Authority asked bosses including Stephen Hester of 
RBS, Bob Diamond of Barclays, Stuart Gulliver of HSBC and Antonio 
Horta-Osorio of Lloyds to show how they have tried to reclaim payouts 
linked to one of the worst misselling scandals in financial services 
history.
