A married couple born 32 years apart have proved that when it comes to love, age really is nothing but a number.  

Norma Harvey, 68, has been married to husband Chris, who is 36, for 15 years.

The couple, who live in Brighton, met at a Butlins holiday camp when Chris was just 18 and Norma was 50.

Generations apart: There are 32 years between Chris and his wife Norma

Recalling the night they met, Chris said: 'I've been out with plenty of girls my own age but I found them immature. I just wanted to date an older woman. 

'I don't know where I got the courage to talk to her so I went up to her and asked her for a dance. She said her feet were too tired so I said I would give her a piggy back!'

The pair have been inseparable since that night and married three years later. 

They reveal in Channel 5 documentary Age Gap Love that while their relationship has been a happy one, it has been difficult to gain acceptance from people.

It's my life: Norma, 68, said she doesn't care what people think of her having a 36-year-old husband

When they tied the knot, none of Norma's family attended and only a handful of Chris' were there.

Norma, who has been married before and has a daughter who is a few months younger than Chris, said: 'It was upsetting not having family guests at the wedding but there was nothing we could do about it.'

She added that she doesn't care that some of her friends and family have never approved of her toy boy.

She said of when they got together: 'I didn't bother about what people were saying. I didn't doubt it or think this is wrong because I enjoyed it. I thought why shouldn't I do this, it's my life.'

Chris said he has no regrets about marrying Norma, even though he admits he was 'just a kid' when they met.

But as well as disapproving friends and family, they have also had to deal with hostility from strangers because of their age difference.

Stood the test of time: The couple have been married for 15 years

Chris said: 'We still get looked at a lot, we get looks in the street. You know when people have clocked you because you get that second glance. 

'One guy spat at us because he saw us holding hands. Someone else told us in a restaurant we couldn't hold hands or kiss in front of his children, I nearly had a fight with him. There's definitely a stigma attached to an age gap relationship.'

It's something that Michael, 64, has also had to deal with thanks to his marriage to Tanisha, who at 28, is 36 years his junior.

They met in her home country of Sierra Leone when he was on a business trip for his job with the Medical Research Council.

He said: 'At the time I wasn't hunting for a wife, I wasn't hunting for a 22 year old partner, it was fate and destiny.'

'I'm a lucky man': Michael, 64, has been married to Tanisha, 28, for four-and-a-half-years 

The couple married four-and-a-half years ago and Michael has had to live with assumptions that she's a gold digger and he's her sugar daddy ever since.

But he said he doesn't let what other people think get to him. 

'That is what we look like - stupid old man who has got a lot of money and a beautiful lady taking him for what she can, in five years time she'll walk out when she's plucked him clean,' he said. 

But he added: 'I am very fortunate at the age of 64 to have a stunningly attractive wife.'

Tanisha, who is trying to establish a career as a model, said she doesn't understand the intrigue into their relationship - in particular their sex life. 

'We have sex like normal people,' she said.

Facing stereotypes: Michael is often called a sugar daddy

Another couple who take criticism of their age gap relationship in their stride is Joe, 61, from Florida, in the U.S., who is married to Angela, 22.

'We have a lot of fun with it, especially when people think I'm her father,' Joe said. He was married previously and has a son who is two years older than his new wife.

The couple met when they were working as actors on a soap opera and their on screen romance continued when the cameras stopped rolling. 

Angela said she isn't bothered about what people think of their 39 year age gap.

'People often think he's my sugar daddy and that I'm getting paid to be with him but that's ridiculous - so older people aren't lovable? The sex is wonderful. Anything he lacks in flexibility I certainly make up for,' she said.

'She's 68, he's 36: Age Gap Love' is on Channel 5 this evening at 9pm
