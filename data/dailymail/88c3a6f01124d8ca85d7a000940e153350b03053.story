Bold scheme: But Nick Clegg's plan to offer free school meals to all young state school children is in chaos, Government sources have said

Nick Clegg’s flagship plan to extend free school meals to all young state school children is in chaos – with thousands likely to have to eat cold packed lunches in classrooms, according to Government sources.

The Deputy Prime Minister announced at the last Liberal Democrat conference that all children between the ages of five and seven would qualify for the free meals from September 2014.

But even some colleagues concede that the £785 million scheme was dreamt up ‘on the back of a fag packet’ and its funding is now in turmoil.

Sources at the Department for Education say Mr Clegg failed to take into account the cost of upgrading kitchen facilities to meet the demand, forcing the Government to offer £150million to pay for the building work.

But the rush to introduce the new entitlement before the 2015 general election means that there is no time to determine which schools and local authorities genuinely need cash.

So councils such as Durham and Newham in East London, which have already upgraded their school facilities, will get extra funding while others which say they need more assistance will not get it.

Though initially the Government pledged a ‘hot, nutritious meal’ for all children in reception and years one and two, ministers have also now accepted that not all schools have the space to provide one.

Cold packed lunches eaten at classroom desks will also qualify, since many schools do not have dedicated dining rooms and use gyms and school halls to serve lunch. Heads say space used for teaching and activities cannot be turned over for extended lunchtimes accommodating many more students.

Sir Nick Harvey, a former Lib Dem defence minister, said: ‘It’s no great surprise that these practical reasons have arisen given that the whole policy appears to have been dreamt up overnight and sketched out on the back of a fag packet.

'It sounds as if the meals are going to be as half-baked as the policy.’

Despite Britain’s vast budget deficit, Mr Clegg announced that regardless of their parents’ income, all children in the first three years of primary school will qualify for free school meals - saving even the best-off families an average of £437 a year per child.

The annual cost of the scheme is to be met through spending cuts elsewhere and moves to clamp down on tax avoidance.

However, critics have questioned the coherence of offering free school meals for all families with young children, while taking the axe to other universal payments such as child benefit for the better-off.

Currently, free school meals are limited to the 400,000 poorest families, and many of those who are entitled do not claim because of the stigma attached to doing so.

Extending them to all under-sevens in state education is designed to show the coalition is taking further steps to help families with the cost of living.

Big giveaway: The Deputy Prime Minister announced at the last Liberal Democrat conference that all children between the ages of five and seven would qualify for the free meals from September 2014

The plan was part of a Lib Dem deal with the Tories that meant them agreeing to a similar sum being spent on a £200-a-year tax break for married couples.

But the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) is warning that many schools ‘absolutely can’t think how they are going to do this’.

Furthermore, the change threatens to undermine another flagship Lib Dem policy - the pupil premium, which means that schools receive £900 a year more for every child who currently qualifies for free school meals.

Critics predict that still fewer families will come forward to declare their income, given that in future they will qualify for free food whether they do so or not.

Some councils are also predicting the scheme will lead to deep cuts elsewhere in the education budget.

Oxfordshire County Council says it is facing a £9million shortfall in the funding needed to upgrade kitchens and dining rooms at its schools in order to deliver the pledge.

Oxfordshire said it had been offered just £1.1million, despite facing an estimated £10 million bill. The council’s Tory leader Ian Hudspeth said: ‘The minute this announcement was made, councils across the country strongly suspected that they would not receive the full funding from central Government to deliver on this pledge.

‘Sadly we look like being proved right, and Oxfordshire is no exception.

‘If the Deputy Prime Minister makes pledges like this relating to locally delivered services, they need to make sure they are properly funded. We have let central Government know of our unhappiness as regards this situation and we will continue to do so.’

The Local Government Association (LGA) warned there was a danger that communities could be ‘short-changed’ unless ministers produce more cash to pay for the refurbishments needed.
