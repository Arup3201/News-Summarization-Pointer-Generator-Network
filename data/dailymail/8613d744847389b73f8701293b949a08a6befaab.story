The families of murder victims could face compensation cuts under Government plans to slash spending by £50million.

Unions and MPs have blasted proposals to cut a quarter of the £200m awarded annually by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme.

The scheme awards compensation to more than 30,000 people each year who are seriously injured following violent crimes.

Loss: Victims of crime could lose compensation under proposals to save £50m

Usdaw, a union that represents retail workers, claims the cuts proposed by the Government would mean almost 90 per cent of victims would see their compensation slashed or axed completely.

The scheme was due to come into force on September 30, but was withdrawn when it was condemned in committee by both Conservative and Labour MPs.

However, the Ministry of Justice is now re-considering the changes.

Usdaw general secretary John Hannett said: 'We were very encouraged when the Government withdrew the revised scheme, particularly in light of the comments made by Conservative backbenchers, but unfortunately this now looks less like a rethink and more like a tactical retreat.

'Despite the Government continuing to suggest otherwise, the current scheme is already on a sustainable financial footing and not even the most seriously affected victims would receive a penny more from the revised scheme.

'On the contrary, half of victims would receive nothing in future and almost 90 per cent will lose out, including those most seriously injured and the children of murder victims.

'We now fear any amendments to the revised scheme will be purely cosmetic changes designed to help ministers avoid future political embarrassment, rather than assist the thousands of innocent victims of violent crime who rely on it as a last resort for financial recompense.'

Rob Flello, Labour Shadow Justice Minister and Conservative MP John Redwood also slammed the planned cuts. Mr Redwood urged the Government to 'think again', adding: 'I did not come into Parliament to see these things cut.'

The Communication Workers Union (CWU) has added its voice to those objecting to the proposals. CWU Cardiff branch secretary and Wales TUC president Amarjite Singh criticised Government plans to cut compensation claims for everything below £5000. He claims this would hit injured postal and telecom workers hard.

He said: 'On average 12 postal workers are attacked every day by dogs. The attack is always dangerous but often the victims also suffer from symptoms of trauma that last long after the event itself.'

'This is yet another Government attack on the most vulnerable members of our society.'

However, the Ministry of Justice, said criminals would shoulder more of the financial burden to make up the shortfall.

A spokesperson said: 'We are putting more onus on criminals paying for victim support services, and expect to see around £50m more a year come from offenders as a result.

The Government continues to contribute £66m a year for victims services.

'Ministers have listened carefully to the concerns raised in Parliament and are considering their next steps in light of this.

'No decision has been taken.'
