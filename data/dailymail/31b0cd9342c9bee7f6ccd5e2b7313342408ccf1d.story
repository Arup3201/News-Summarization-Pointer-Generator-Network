Human remains found at a NSW beach are believed to belong to a five-year-old boy who was feared drowned when he was swept out to sea almost two weeks ago.

Chayce Kofe was playing with relatives on the shoreline at Pearl Beach on the Central Coast on July 10 when a large wave carried him out into the ocean.

Police were called to the beach about 3.30pm on Monday with reports a child's body had been spotted in the water by a man walking his dog.

A large scale rescue search including police divers and a helicopter was carried out with human remains located in the water at about 7pm.

The remains are yet to be identified, but a NSW Police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia it was believed to be the body of five-year-old Chayce.

Chayce, who lived on the Central Coast, was holidaying with extended family in the coastal hamlet during the recent school holidays when the accident happened.

His family maintained a beachside vigil as search teams looked for the boy, with his father Daniel Kelly pledging on Facebook to find the five-year-old or 'die trying'.

'Daddy is so sorry son... I luv [sic] you forever Chaycee,' Mr Kelly posted.

'It would never of happened if I was [there]. It's just not fair and I can't handle dat [sic] my son has been ripped away from me and I have no control over da [sic] outcome.'

Full-scale searches involving helicopters, police divers and surf lifesavers failed to find the young boy in the days after he went missing.
