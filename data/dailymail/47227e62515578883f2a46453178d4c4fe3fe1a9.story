 

New life, new job, new man!  

Despite going through a very public - and very messy - divorce, former The View co-host Sherri Shepherd has quietly started dating R&B singer Johnny Gill, MailOnline has learned exclusively.

A friend of Sherri's tells Mail Online that the couple met on June 25 when Johnny performed with his band New Edition on The View and they've been seeing each other ever since.

'Sherri is a big New Edition fan and was excited to have them at the show. But she and Johnny really connected and exchanged personal contact information,' a source at the show reveals.

The two began speaking long distance, using FaceTime on their iPhones. 

Then Johnny flew Sherri out to see him where New Edition 'All Six' tour, featuring the whole group, was playing.

'She flew out to see him in Houston, Virginia Beach and Los Angeles. She enjoyed being out on the road and enjoyed getting to know him,' according to the friend.

After their special date night in Houston, Johnny tweeted: 'you're the best, I had so much fun hanging with you, love love love you!!!'

My my my: The sparks are flying, but Sherri tells friends she and Johnny are taking it slow. She has been married twice and is in the throes of a bitter divorce with Lamar Sally. Gill has never been married but has a son with an ex-girlfriend

'Sometimes you need friends who make you laugh,' Sherri coyly responded. 'Thank you for a crazy night!"

Johnny flew into New York City to be with Sherri when she taped her last episode of The View on July 31. The group Bell Biv DeVoe, a break-off trio from New Edition, was one of Sherri's special guests.

'Johnny stayed off camera because they want to keep the fact that they're dating low key. But he was there to celebrate her farewell from the show and she was happy he was with her,' the source explained.

During the Los Angeles tour stop for New Edition at the Nokia Theatre on Aug. 3, Sherri even ended up on stage with Johnny's other group member Ralph Trasvent. During Ralph's solo set, he brings several women on stage to serenade and Johnny let Ralph sing to Sherri.

Gill joined New Edition in 1987 as one of its lead singers and has performed and recorded as a solo artist. His acting appearances have include a cameo role on the hit TV series Family Matters and the 2006 film Madea’s Family Reunion.

Bitter battle: Sherri reportedly offered her estranged husband Lamar Sally a $100,000 divorce payout

Despite the couple' strong affection for each other, Sherri has told friends she intends to take things slow. She enjoys his companionship, but isn't interested rushing into anything.

'She enjoys having a man who can actually take care of her. He picks up the check at dinner and takes care of her flights. He's financially secure and that's very appealing to her,' the source added.

Johnny has never been married, but has an 8-year-old son named Isiah with his former fiancé.

Sherri and second husband Lamar, who separated in May, remain embroiled in a very bitter divorce. He is attempting to have their prenuptial agreement overturned in an effort to get more then his predetermined compensation.

The two are also fighting to work out a settlement for the child that Sherri arranged for Lamar to have via a surrogate. He wanted her name listed on the birth certificate but she has opted not to be involved in the child's life. She has a son, Jeffrey, 9, from her first marriage.

Sherri reportedly offered her estranged husband, a $100,000 divorce payment and $3,000 a month in child support but he rejected the offer.
