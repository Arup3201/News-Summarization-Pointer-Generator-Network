Pet hate: Radio 2 presenter Sir Terry Wogan bemoans his lack of ability to open a tin of sardines on BBC1's Room 101

His wry observations on the absurdities and dilemmas encountered in life helped to turn Sir Terry Wogan into a household name.

Now the 74 year old broadcaster has turned his attention to the daily battle his generation faces with difficult packaging.

From the sardine tin that won’t open to the toothpaste enclosed in fortress-like plastic, Sir Terry does not hold back from voicing his frustration in the new series of BBC1’s Room 101.

Discussing his pet hates with host Frank Skinner, Sir Terry said: ‘It’s food packaging in particular – with sardines or pilchards in a tin you put your finger in the ring thing, dislocate your finger and break your nails.

‘Then the damn thing comes away and you’ve got to get a tin opener anyway, all for a sardine.

‘Then there are those bottles where you have to press down the top before you can open them…’

And the kitchen isn’t the only place in the house Sir Terry faces the perils of packaging.

He continued: ‘Taking things further it becomes very difficult to open things when you get to my distinguished age.

‘Has anyone tried to break into a toothbrush lately?

‘You’re in the bathroom and you think, ‘I’ll restore my dentures to their pristine glory’. I’ve got a new toothbrush here but can I open it?’

During the programme, which will be broadcast later this month (Jan 11), Mr Skinner is far from sympathetic to Sir Terry’s plight, telling him: ‘It’s made me realise why old people get up so early.’

With a career spanning five decades in showbusiness, Sir Terry has no designs to settle into retirement.

Earlier this year he presented seven hours of live TV for the BBC’s annual Children in Need appeal and still has his own Radio 2 show Weekend Wogan.

Sir Terry, who was knighted by the Queen in 2005, has been married to his ex-model wife, Helen for 47 years and they have two sons and a daughter: Alan, 45, Mark 42, and Katherine, 40.

His rant on packaging comes just weeks after he urged diners to protest at the food provided by some five star establishments.

Recalling a recent Lord’s Taverners lunch at Grosvenor House, he described the turkey as ‘an indefinable lump of rolled white meat that could have been anything’.

‘It was,’ he tells me, ‘served with sprouts like bullets, soggy potatoes and a bread sauce that would have been at home on a plasterer’s tray.’

And the Irish-born broadcaster didn’t  spare other multi-starred establishments. ‘I went to a saints and sinners lunch at the Savoy recently and the turkey was unbelievable,’

‘They churn out this stuff at Christmas and nobody ever complains.

‘They are afraid to make a scene.

‘Nobody ever thinks: “We’d better improve our standards.”

According to the latest research,  more rubbish goes to landfill in Britain than in any other European country.

With items such as shrink-wrapped coconuts and single bananas sold in plastic trays.

The law on excess packaging was introduced in 1999 and appears to offer a simple route to outlawing waste.

It says packaging should be limited to ‘the minimum adequate amount’ to ensure safety and hygiene.

However, just a handful of companies have been prosecuted, while the maximum fine is just £5,000.
