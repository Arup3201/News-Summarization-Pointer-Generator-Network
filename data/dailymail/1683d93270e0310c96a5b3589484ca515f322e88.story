Two prison inmates have been found guilty of murdering a child killer who tortured his partner's two-year-old daughter to death.

Gary Smith, 48, and Lee Newell, 44, blamed each other for the death of Subhan Anwar, who was strangled in his cell at HMP Long Lartin in south Worcestershire.

But both were convicted of murder today by a jury at Warwick Crown Court.

Double killers: Lee Newell, 44, (left) and Gary Smith, 48, (right) who murdered child killer Subhan Anmwar, 24, in his cell at HMP Long Lartin. Both men were already serving life behind bars for earlier murders they carried out

Anwar, from Huddersfield, was serving a life sentence for killing his partner's two-year-old daughter.

Smith and Newall tied him up and throttled him with a pair of tracksuit bottoms on Long Lartin's Delta Wing on February 14.

Smith, who carried out a murder in 1998, and Newell, who killed in 1988, were both already serving life sentences.

They are likely to be sentenced next week for murdering Anwar, who had received compensation after a previous incident in which he was assaulted by inmates.

Horrific: Sanam Navsarka suffered 107 injuries during a month of 'unbelievable' cruelty before she died

Neither Newell nor Smith showed any emotion as they were unanimously convicted after the jury had deliberated for around three-and-a-half hours.Jurors also convicted Newell of 
stealing a watch, prayer beads and a metal earring belonging to Anwar, 
while Smith admitted the theft of property from the child-killer's cell.

Horror: Two 'tramline' bruises showed where Sanam had been hit with this metal pole

Jurors heard how Smith calmly made 
Newell a cup of hot chocolate - even sweetening it with icing sugar - 
during a stand-off with prison staff after Anwar was strangled.

Prison
 staff were initially told Anwar had been taken hostage because the two 
inmates were 'bored' - with Newell telling a warder: 'He's gone, he's 
with Allah.'

Both defendants opted not to give evidence at the trial, but CCTV and DNA evidence proved they were involved in the killing.

A post mortem examination found Anwar's neck had been broken.

The
 24-year-old was serving a sentence of at least 23 years at the Category
 A jail, having been convicted of murdering two-year-old Sanam Navsarka 
at Bradford Crown Court in 2009.

The youngster suffered 107 injuries during a month of ‘unbelievable’ 
cruelty in which she was battered with metal poles and had all four 
limbs broken.

The child, who was afraid of the dark, was ‘disciplined’ by being 
repeatedly locked in an unlit cupboard, while Anwar also put her in a 
tumble drier and dumped her in a bin for his amusement.

Sanam suffered further agony when aftershave was splashed on her nappy 
rash and open sores. She was not taken to a doctor, so her fractures 
remained untreated.

In her final days she was suffering so much from her injuries that she 
could not walk and died when fat deposits from her broken bones entered 
the bloodstream, Bradford Crown Court heard.

A post-mortem examination revealed that along with her broken arms and 
legs, there were 36 bruises to her head and neck, 26 to her arms and ten
 to her abdomen.

Her death came only three months after married mobile phone salesman 
Anwar met the child’s mother Zahbeena Navsarka at the shop where he 
worked in Huddersfield.

Anwar had sex with Navsarka in the back of the shop on the day they met
 and he swiftly left his pregnant wife to move in with his new lover. To
 cover their tracks after the child died in 2008, they told detectives 
she was left alone in the bath for ten minutes and was found dead.

But Anwar, described as brutal and domineering, was convicted and jailed
 for a minimum of 23 years.

Navsarka was cleared of her daughter’s 
murder but found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to nine years in 
prison.
