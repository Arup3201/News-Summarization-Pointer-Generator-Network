There was no immediate update on his condition but images showed the 33-year-old bloodied and unconscious while being treated by paramedics.

Swiss media outlets later reported that Amman had regained consciousness upon reaching a hospital in Salzburg but the extent of his injuries remains unclear. 

Amman was a double Olympic champion at both the 2002 and 2010 games, and also won gold medals at the World Championships in 2007 and 2010.

Stefan Kraft became the seventh straight Austrian winner of the competition in Bischofshofen, Austria.

Kraft finished the final event in third position to hold on to his lead after the first three stops. Fellow Austrian Michael Hayboeck won the final event with jumps of 137.5 and 136.5 meter for a total of 288.4 points.

Japanese veteran Noriaki Kasai was second with 277.1 points, followed by Kraft with 271.3.
