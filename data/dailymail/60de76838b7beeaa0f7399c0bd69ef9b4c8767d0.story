A Queensland woman has taken to sleeping under the stairs in her public housing home as she is terrified of walking up and down the stairs of the townhouse.

Holly Johnson, a single mother pregnant with her second child, is trying to get the Department of Housing to relocate her to a larger, single level property.

She told A Current Affair she fell down the stairs of the house 12 months ago and fractured her ankle in three places.

Holly now says she is scared of another accident and 'shakes' every time she has to face the climb.

Single mother Holly Johnson wants a new public housing home so she doesn't have to use the stairs

'I've fallen down them once, and I don't want to lose this baby, you know... it's a gift being pregnant', she told the program.

She sleeps on a single mattress beneath the stairs of her Queensland home, with her young daughter's cot beside her.

However she still has to make the trip upstairs many times a day as that's where the bathroom is located

Following her ankle injury Holly underwent surgery and the social worker at the hospital said the stairs should be upgraded, and that it was understandable for Holly to be concerned about using them.

Holly was apparently blacklisted from the private rental market in 2006 after a dispute over conditions of her lease. She says public housing is her only option.

After continuously applying for a transfer, the mother-of-one was told it may take up to eight years to move her as she is classified as having 'moderate needs'.

When asked why she should be classed as high priority Holly responded that it was necessary 'because I'm scared' and said there are plenty of empty houses laying around she could move into.

Housing Minister Tim Mander denied this and said there are many Australians sleeping on the street and thousands more on the waiting list to move.

Holly lives in her current home with her sister and 19-year-old niece, and says another reason she should be considered for a larger home is because the family is growing.

She is due to give birth in February, and insists her fear of the 'dangerous' staircase is not an overreaction.

She hopes to move before her second baby is born in February, but for now has moved her daughter's cot downstairs too
