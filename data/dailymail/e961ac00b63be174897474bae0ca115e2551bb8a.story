A quick search on Instagram today reveals more than 228 million photos tagged with the hashtag #selfie - and that figure doesn't include the selfies taken without the tag.

But which US states, and UK towns are the most vain when it comes to posting photos of themselves? 

Using data taken from Instagram's developer API platform, researchers have plotted these selfies on maps to discover Hawaii is the most narcissistic state, Brighton residents are Britain's vainest, and in London, the most selfies are taken in the borough of Westminster.

Explore the interactive selfie maps of the US, UK and London below 

The maps (US pictured) are based on data collected using the Instagram API platform, of images tagged #selfie with a geolocation. They were designed by Create It Now using open source mapping software CartoDB. The hashtags, collected between 1 November and the 5 January, were geolocated and placed onto the maps. Using these coordinates, experts merged the data with population figures taken from government and federal stats to give a 'selfies per 100,000 inhabitants' figure

Using geolocation information from photos posted to Instagram with the #selfie tag, researchers plotted each selfie on respective maps of the US, UK and London.

The data was collected between 1 November last year and the start of January. It only included photos posted with the #selfie hashtag, and photos that had been geolocated. 

The actual number of selfies globally is much higher.

Once the coordinates had been plotted, the designers merged the data with population statistics taken from official government, federal or stat figures, in order to determine how many selfies are taken per 100,000 inhabitants in each region. 

On each map, the blue dots represent the locations of selfies. 

But in the UK, larger coloured dots are designed to show the proportion of selfies taken per 100,000 people, at a glance.

In the US, 72 photos were posted online by people in Hawaii. 

With an estimated population of 1.4 million, that equates to more than five selfies posted per 100,000 inhabitants.

A total of 91 selfies were tagged on Instagram in Nevada, but because the state's population is double that of Hawaii's, the state came in second place with 3.2 selfies. 

New York was the third vainest state, with 2.1 selfies per 100,000. 

However, the District of Columbia also got a special mention, in addition to the US states, because despite its low population - estimated at 659,000 - it posted 2.73 selfies per 100,000 residents.

The least vain states included Idaho, Iowa, Wyoming and South Dakota. 

In the UK, people in Brighton were found to post the most selfies, with seven photos per 100,000 residents in the local authority.  

In the UK, people in Brighton were found to post the most selfies with seven photos per 100,000 residents in the local authority. Surprisingly, Birmingham, the largest local authority on the list, was the least vain at 2.1 selfies, and northern cities, Liverpool, Leeds and Sheffield were also among the least vain. The data is limited, however, because only 36 councils in the UK were found to have enough data available to create an accurate set, and most of them came from larger urban areas

At the top of the list, Brighton was closely followed by Manchester in second place, with 6.6 selfies per 100,000 residents, and Greater London was third with 5.7 selfies. 

And in Scotland, Glasgow was found to be more vain than Edinburgh, with 5.2 selfies compared to five, respectively. 

The data is limited, however, because only 36 councils in the UK were found to have enough data available to create an accurate set, and most of them came from larger urban areas. 

Looking further into the figures for Greater London, the researchers plotted locations based on each borough. 

People in Westminster posted a staggering 38.3 selfies per 100,000 residents.

This figure was taken from 84 selfies posted in a population 219,400 over the two month period.

Camden was in second place with 15.9 selfies per 100,000 residents. 

The least vain borough was Richmond Upon Thames, where only two selfies were posted, which worked out a 1.1 selfies per 100,000 residents. 

Create It Now explained: 'There are, as always, a couple of side notes to the research. 

'We recognise that the data collected is only a fraction of the true amount of selfies taken; not everyone allows their location to be attached to their images and most people that take a selfie dont use the #selfie. 

'However finding photos with both geolocation and the #selfie is the only method to accurately rank how 'vain' cities are.' 

The top 18 vainest London boroughs are pictured. People in Westminster (centre) posted 38.3 selfies per 100,000 residents. This figure was taken from 84 selfies posted in a population 219,400, over two months. Camden was second place with 15.9 selfies per 100,000 residents. The least vain borough was Richmond Upon Thames, where two selfies were posted, which worked out a 1.1 selfies per 100,000 residents
