A graphic designer has been suspended by the concentration camp museum where he worked for using their printers to produce anti-Semitic propaganda - including posters reading: 'Jews go home'

Staff at Majdanek in Poland - where 80,000 people were murdered by Nazis during World War Two - called in the police after discovering the cache of offensive material produced on site.

A man named as Krzysztof K, who worked at the museum for 20 years, is accused of being part of a group which distributed offensive Nazi material around the town.

Around 60,000 of the total killed in the camp are thought to have been Jews - around half of those who passed through the camp.

'We're shocked by these revelations,' museum spokeswoman Agnieszka Kowalczyk-Nowak said.

'We've launched an internal investigation at the museum. Management has decided to suspend him from duty while the case is being clarified.'

Nazi Germany set up the Majdanek camp on the outskirts of Lublin in 1941 and ran it until 1944.

Allegations: The designer was found with a collection of offensive material - including a poster which read: 'Jews go home', it was claimed

The racist posters with messages like 'Zionists Leave Lublin' were posted up at bus stops around the region.

Police
 now claim that the man, Krzysztof K, had been the one who designed and printed them.

Four others who helped to plan the racist campaign and put up the posters have also been arrested, and charged with anti-Semitism, police said.

Officers said all the Poles were arrested in the eastern city of Lublin where they have been charged with incitement to hatred after three of them were caught red handed putting up posters at bus stops.

Police said the group, who also included a local businessman and several unemployed individuals, had been putting up anti-Semitic posters around town since 2010.

They face up to seven and a half years in prison.
